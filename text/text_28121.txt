BACKGROUND
natural glycans are known to take part in many key biological processes such as cell adhesion, recognition, receptor activation or signal transduction, and they also exhibit major structural functions in both bacteria and plants. in addition, bacterial glycans act as virulence, osmoprotection and desiccation protection factors  <cit> . the diversity of structures within the mammalian glycome seems limited and is well described in the literature  <cit> . on the other hand, the bacterial glycome exhibits greater diversity, stemming largely from the distinct cell wall architecture of these organisms.

the cell envelope of either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria is based on peptidoglycan, a polymer in which polysaccharide chains are cross-linked with short peptide chains  <cit> . gram-negative bacteria possess an additional outer membrane that is composed of a lipopolysaccharide-protein complex. gram-positive bacteria have no outer membrane, but the peptidoglycan wall is thicker  and contains polysaccharides with teichoic acids attached .

both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria produce extracellular polysaccharides, present either as a discrete capsule covalently attached to the cell envelope or as a slime weakly bound to the cell surface. these various glycoconjugates and polysaccharides on the surface of the cell often contain the antigenic determinants that initiate an immunogenic response in a host. in addition, these surface carbohydrates provide recognition elements for pathogens such as bacteriophages.

the lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria contains lipid a, a phosphorylated glcn-glcn disaccharide moiety, n- and o-acylated with fatty acids which anchor the molecule in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. lipid a is covalently linked to a heteropolysaccharide which interacts with the environment and consists of an inner core  and manno-heptoses) and an outer o-specific chain, a complex polysaccharide which determines the serological or antigenic properties of the lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . these so-called o-antigens are mainly heteropolymers containing a large variety of residues . these components, together with the capsular polysaccharides , can elicit an immune response in higher organisms.

the structures of the various carbohydrate antigens are unique, often being characterized by repeating units in the polymer structure. indeed, all types of monosaccharides, including l-rhamnose  and l-fucose , are found in bacteria, together with rarer, modified sugars, such as  <dig> -dideoxyhexoses and kdo. knowledge of the structures of surface carbohydrates and their variations is required for understanding how cellular recognition, adhesion, and the immune response operate at the molecular level. this understanding provides a basis for the design of synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccines, diagnostic agents, and immunostimulators. certain fragments of bacterial polysaccharides, in the form of appropriate glycoconjugates, are known to act as vaccines  <cit> .

carbohydrates represent the most diverse class of biopolymers, and there is growing interest in the study and analysis of this diversity and its biomedical significance. for example, vertebrate glycan variability is assumed to act as a barrier that prevents the spread of an infection within a given population  <cit> . although it is widely known that the diversity of carbohydrates is much greater in bacteria than in mammals, no systematic attempt has been undertaken to examine the diversity of bacterial carbohydrates in detail. the structures deposited in glycoscience databases have been only sporadically evaluated. however, statistical structure-oriented investigations using carbohydrate databases were proven to be useful for immunochemical research and serotyping  <cit> . systematic analysis of all publicly available data will not only expand our general knowledge and understanding of the complexity of glycans in biological systems but will also offer a framework for the design of more comprehensive high-throughput screening methods or devices.

comprehensive data concerning carbohydrate diversity within the entire bacterial world will be useful for the classification of bacteria according to their glycan structures and facilitate the search for the most widespread carbohydrate markers of various bacterial taxonomic groups. these markers are critical for medical applications, and a simple ranking by abundance is a good starting point for the design of synthetic biologically-active carbohydrates and for corresponding immunological studies. in particular, the statistics of monomer composition reveal potential taxonomic markers and also simplify the creation of carbohydrate microarrays by providing candidates for spotting  <cit> .

a one-enzyme-class/one-saccharide-linkage paradigm applies for almost all individual steps of glycan biosynthesis. accordingly, complete information on the diversity of disaccharide fragments allows one to describe the diversity of the glycosyltransferases expressed in individual taxonomic groups, and these enzymes may become potential targets for antimicrobial treatment.

for this study we performed statistical analyses of the bacterial carbohydrate structure data bank , the largest database for bacterial glycans containing nearly all known bacterial glycan structures published up to  <dig>  <cit> . for comparison the mammalian glycans documented in the glycosciences.de database  <cit>   have also been examined. the properties analyzed include glycan size, branching, and charge density, as well as the frequency of occurrence of specific monosaccharide residues, residue pairs and their linkage configurations. precise definitions for the terminology used in this study can be found in the methods section.

RESULTS
distribution of carbohydrate structures among taxonomic groups
we first examined the number of sequences found in the bcsdb and glycosciences.de for various taxonomic ranks . where possible, the taxonomic relationships were traced using the ncbi taxonomy database  <cit> . the glycosciences.de database currently contains a total of  <dig> glycan and glycoconjugate records, of which  <dig> records for diverse animal, plant, bacteria and fungi classes have some information concerning taxonomy. in the bcsdb there are a total of  <dig> records for bacteria only, and  <dig> of these contain information concerning taxonomy. these numbers may include multiple records for a given glycan when the same glycan is reported for more than one species. note that not all taxonomic classes are represented in the databases and that for bacterial glycans there is considerable overlap between the two databases.

if we now consider the two databases combined, there are a total of  <dig> nonredundant carbohydrate records which include taxonomic information. the distribution of these records among various taxonomic classes is shown both numerically and schematically in fig.  <dig>  a more detailed breakdown of the distribution can be found in the additional material .

the taxonomic class mammalia is found to have  <dig> assigned sequence/taxon pairs, of which  <dig> are of human origin . all other animal or plant classes in the database have less than  <dig> pairs. the category "unresolved" refers to the  <dig> records for which the source is defined but the specific taxonomic class could not be traced automatically using the ncbi. only about half of the bacterial phyla are represented in the bcsdb with a total of  <dig> sequence/taxon pairs, and nine classes have less than  <dig> records. note that the number of carbohydrates or glycoconjugates registered for a given taxonomic class does not necessarily reflect its species diversity, but more likely the intensity with which the class has been studied. thus, the apparent diversity of carbohydrates in the various taxonomic classes reflects to a large part the information bias in the published literature, and this situation must be kept in mind when making conclusions based on the distributions of properties discussed below.

in the combined databases there are a total of  <dig> records in the category "no taxonomy" which means that either no information concerning the taxonomy of the source is available or that the carbohydrate is not of purely natural origin. these records were not included in fig.  <dig> and were not used in the following analyses.

choice of taxonomic datasets for statistical comparisons
for the following more detailed statistical comparisons, we defined two sets of taxonomic groups, considering both biological and coverage aspects. taxonomy set  <dig>  was defined to provide an overview of the total content of the two databases used for the general comparison of bacterial and mammalian carbohydrates, taking into account the fact that bacterial carbohydrates frequently contain repeating units while mammalian sequences usually do not. thus, set  <dig> contains three taxonomic groups: all mammalian carbohydrates, all bacterial carbohydrates with nonrepeating sequences , and all bacterial sequences with repeating units .

* for each group each unique carbohydrate sequence was counted only once; a given sequence may occur in more than one taxonomic group.

for comparisons within the taxonomic domain bacteria, we defined a more detailed taxonomy set  <dig> , which includes two classes of gram-positive bacteria  and the various classes of the phylum proteobacteria. the largest of these classes, the γ-proteobacteria, has been further subdivided in set  <dig> into the major order enterobacteriales and a subset containing all other γ-proteobacteria. the class δ-proteobacteria  has been combined with the ε-proteobacteria.

* the groups used to define set  <dig> are those with more than  <dig> sequences and are listed without parentheses.

** for each class each unique carbohydrate sequence was counted only once; a given sequence may occur in more than one taxonomic group.

in order to obtain meaningful statistics, only those taxonomic groups are compared for which at least  <dig> carbohydrate sequences are available. for this reason the classes chlamydiae, clostridia, and bacteroidetes, for example, have not been included in set  <dig>  note that in tables  <dig> and  <dig> the total number of unique carbohydrate sequences in each group is listed, and these sets were utilized in all subsequent analyses.

carbohydrate size, branching and charge density
frequency distributions for general measures of molecular size, topology  and mean charge density have been calculated for the carbohydrate sequences comprising the various taxonomic groupings described by set  <dig> and set  <dig> . in each case the distributions are normalized to the total number of sequences in each taxonomic group and expressed as percentages within each group. in fig. 2a distributions for the number of monosaccharides per sequence unit  are shown for bacteria vs. mammals . the distribution is relatively broad for mammals with mean and median values, respectively, of  <dig>  and  <dig> monomers per sequence, while for bacteria the distribution shows a narrow peak at 4– <dig> monomers for both oligomers  and for the repeating unit of polymers . however, oligomers show a significant population of sequences with 8– <dig> monomers while the distribution for polymers essentially ends at  <dig> monomers per unit. of course, the total length of a polymeric sequence with multiple units may very well exceed the maximum length of oligomers. naturally occurring oligomers may also be longer than the sequences reported in the databases since the process of extracting and isolating a glycan may result in partial digestion and loss of residues.

in fig. 2b the distributions of the size parameter for the bacterial groups defined in taxonomy set  <dig> are found to differ considerably. narrow distributions with essentially a single prominant peak are found for actinobacteria , bacilli  and the order enterobacteria  with peaks at ca.  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  residues, respectively. the various other classes of proteobacteria have broader distributions with more or less pronounced multiple peaks, e.g. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> residues for the δ,ε-proteobacteria group.

the number of branching points per carbohydrate residue can be considered to be a branching index which reflects the complexity of carbohydrate topology. fig. 3a demonstrates that 22% of all mammalian and 50% of all bacterial sequences are linear . however, for the individual bacterial groups of taxonomy set  <dig>  the percentage of linear structures ranges from 30% to 78% . a general feature of all branching point graphs in fig.  <dig> is a peak in the distribution at a branching index of  <dig>  –  <dig> , which corresponds to carbohydrate sequences with one branching point for every three to five monosaccharide residues. this peak in the distribution is weak for actinobacteria and α-proteobacteria but strong for mammals, bacilli, and other proteobacteria.

finally, the mean charge density parameter  is shown in fig.  <dig> for taxonomy set  <dig> and set  <dig>  about 58% of mammalian sequences and 47% of all bacterial carbohydrate sequence units have no net charge . for the bacterial groups of set  <dig>  the frequency of sequence units with no net charge ranges from ca. 32% for β-proteobacteria to 77% for actinobacteria . all other sequences have a net negative charge due to carboxyl, phosphate or sulfate groups, for example. the distributions for mammals and bacilli both have peaks at charge densities of - <dig>  and - <dig> ; the δ,ε-proteobacteria distribution exhibits a single broad peak at ca. - <dig>  while the other bacterial distributions have multiple peaks at - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig>  and - <dig>  .

monosaccharide diversity
for mammals and even more so for bacteria, the diversity of the monosaccharides used as the building blocks of carbohydrate sequences is significantly larger than that for the residues in proteins or nucleic acids. from the glycosciences.de database a total of  <dig> different monosaccharides were found for mammalian carbohydrates, according to the nomenclature used in the original databases . this degree of diversity is at first glance puzzling, in view of the common notion that mammalian carbohydrates are built up of  <dig> "classical" monosaccharides   <cit> . however, the variety of monosaccharides defined in the primary databases is higher due to  residues being specified with unknown anomer or ring type definitions,  analytical artifacts from the structure elucidation process , or  secondary modifications such as sulfation. furthermore, carbohydrate sequence databases are not error-free and suffer from incorrect structure elucidations and curation mistakes. since the existing databases generally use free-text identifiers for the monosaccharides, it was helpful to translate all structural database entries into a machine-readable notation called glycoct  <cit> . using structural filters based on this notation we were able to significantly reduce the fuzziness introduced by the lack of strictness in the definitions of the original sequences . during the analysis we excluded manually common artifacts caused by analytical procedures and entries with undefined absolute or anomeric configuration or ring type.

the total number of different monosaccharides, basetypes, and basic entities are listed for each group in taxonomy set  <dig> and set  <dig>  when counting in the combined databases, an occurrence threshold of  <dig> for mammals and  <dig> for bacteria was employed.

* the basic entity d-fuc was excluded from mammalia for reasons given in the text.

** in this case there are more basic entities compared to basetypes because amino derivatives are included in the basic entities.

to minimize the influence of errors and artifacts on the statistics of table  <dig>  a threshold for the occurrence of monosaccharides, basetypes and basic entities was set at  <dig> for mammals and  <dig> for bacteria. this means that a given residue type was included in the statistics only when its number of occurrences exceeded the defined threshold. a relatively low threshold was chosen for bacteria because, in contrast to mammals, bacteria are known to produce a great variety of unique monosaccharide residues with low occurrence. when the threshold for bacteria was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig>  the diversity of detected residues increased by about 25%. a complete list of monosaccharide residues and basetypes found for each taxonomic group is available in glycoct nomenclature in the additional material .

for mammals the analysis returned  <dig> occurrences of d-fuc as a basic entity. however, this residue was excluded from table  <dig> because all carbohydrates in glycosciences.de which are specified to contain d-fucose originate from old publications in which the absolute configuration of fuc was not specified. the occurrence of d-fuc in mammalian carbohydrate records can be regarded as a data translation error since there is no evidence for a mammalian enzyme which synthesizes d-fuc.

the  <dig> monosaccharides with the highest occurrence within taxonomy set  <dig> are shown schematically in fig.  <dig>  of them, all  <dig> monosaccharides that were found in mammalian carbohydrates are also found in the bacterial world. rhamnose, l-glycero-α-d-manno-heptose, α-d-galacturonic acid and α-kdo are the most frequent monosaccharides that are unique to bacteria and, except for rhamnose, are preferably located in the core portions of bacterial saccharides, in accordance with the typical lipopolysaccharide  structure of gram-negative bacteria, the classes which dominate in this analysis .

a more detailed analysis of monosaccharide residues in the bacterial taxonomy groups of set  <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  kdo and l-glycero-d-manno-heptose are confined to gram-negative bacteria, whereas gram-positive bacteria seem to have an excess of arabinoses and methylated hexoses.

generally, monosaccharides that are unique to bacteria are of special interest as potential immunogenic targets. existing vaccines frequently take advantage of the unique saccharides in the complex carbohydrates located on the surface of bacteria  <cit> . fig.  <dig> presents the unique monosaccharides  found for the bacterial and mammalian groups. due to the greater diversity of bacterial monosaccharides, many carbohydrates unique to the bacterial world were found , whereas only two mammalian monosaccharides  appear to have no counterpart in the bacterial world. it is known that neuraminic acid derivatives are typically found at the terminal positions of mammalian glycoconjugates, being mediators for cell-cell interaction or receptors for pathogens  <cit> . the presence of exposed α-neu5ac residues in bacteria may be an evolutionary advantage through which bacteria mask themselves to the host immune system.

attention should be paid to the distribution of monosaccharides at the terminal positions of oligomers and side chains of polymers. in higher organisms such residues are optimally positioned to mediate recognition by endogenous carbohydrate-binding proteins  <cit> . according to our findings bacterial carbohydrates often have glucose residues at the nonreducing ends, in contrast to mammalian glycans . this may be the result of the evolutionary adaptation of bacteria since exposed terminal glucose residues are important for the adherence of bacteria and entry into host epithelial cells, as demonstrated for salmonella and pseudomonas  <cit> .

fig.  <dig> demonstrates that more than 70% of the monosaccharides in every taxonomic group are reported to be in the pyranose form, with most groups even reaching 90%. an interesting finding is that more than 50% of all furanose residues found in bacteria are in the  <dig> glycan sequences of the class actinobacteria . nearly 20% of all residues in actinobacteria glycans are in the furanose form, compared to < 4% for all other bacterial groups studied. a high proportion of furanose residues has also been found for plants . in the majority of cases where linear forms or rings of unknown size are found, they can be explained as artifacts of the structure elucidation process, especially when present at the reducing end. however, linear monosaccharides are known to occur occasionally in bacterial carbohydrate sequences and are most prevalent in bacilli and actinobacteria .

monosaccharide modifications
part of the diversity of monosaccharides can be found in their modifications . for bacteria secondary modifications often play a role in the mediation of reactivity and lability to various environmental conditions such as ph. the n-acetylamino group is the most common substituent for carbohydrates in mammals  and in most bacteria classes , except for α-proteobacteria  and actinobacteria . acetylation of amino groups plays a key role in regulating the ability of amino sugars to form hydrogen bonds and to bear charge  <cit> .

o-methylation is the most frequent modification for actinobacteria  but occurs with a frequency of < 5% in other bacteria classes and is essentially absent in mammals.

o-acetyl, amino, or phosphate substituents are also much more prevalent for bacteria  than for mammals , and the o-acetylation pattern is often different for different cultures of a single bacteria strain. o-acetyl groups mask the protective epitopes for bacteria through steric hindrance or altered conformations, as shown for meningococci  <cit> .

amino sugars with free aminogroups are present in about 7% of bacterial carbohydrate residues compared to ca. 1% for mammals and feature a positively charged -nh3+ substituent at neutral ph. the occurrence of these residues in the bacterial cell wall affects hydrophobicity and makes bacteria resistant to the lysozyme of the host, as has been demonstrated for glucosamine in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . several secondary modifications appear to be unique for bacterial carbohydrates  while sulfation or n-glycolyl substitution occurs primarily in mammals. finally, about 7% of bacterial residues have modifications listed under the category "other" in fig. 9a, with actinobacteria and bacilli showing the highest frequencies .

disaccharide fragment patterns in bacteria and mammals
the topological characteristics of glycan architecture can be described by statistics which document the frequency distributions for specific neighboring pairs of monosaccharides connected either with any type of linkage  or via specific linkage positions . the matrix diagram in fig.  <dig> illustrates the statistics of linked monosaccharide pairs for bacteria. here the frequencies of any type of glycosidic linkage between the  <dig> most common donor and acceptor residues are shown. the areas of the circles plotted at the coordinates for a given pair represent its relative abundance within a given bacterial taxonomic group. note that not all possible monosaccharide pairs are actually found in the natural sequences registered in the database . some combinations are exclusive for gram-positive bacteria, e.g. those involving α-d-araf or α-d-glcp6me in actinobacteria while others may exhibit similar or widely differing abundances across the taxonomic groups. the high abundances found along the diagonal of the matrix stem from homopolymeric subsequences which are frequent in bacteria. note that the results for "kdo"  originate from analytical artifacts. detailed results for a total of  <dig> pairs in bacterial and mammalian carbohydrates are summarized in the additional material section .

in order to describe carbohydrate sequences at a higher level of complexity, we need to consider not only the identities of the linked monosaccharides but also the linkage configuration. all free hydroxyl groups on each acceptor monosaccharide are potential sites of glycosyltransferase reactions. therefore, we define the child  to parent  connection in terms of the directed glycosylation linkage pattern, analogous to reaction patterns described elsewhere  <cit> . thus, the descriptor "a1–4", for example, indicates that an alpha anomeric o <dig> of the donor is linked to c <dig> of the acceptor. the statistics of linkage patterns provide a direct description of the expression and activity of glycosyltransferases and the carbohydrate structure repetoire in an organism or taxonomic group. such statistics have been employed successfully for a variety of bioinformatic tasks with the glycome, e.g. matrix generation  <cit>  and pattern detection  <cit> . this kind of information is also valuable for recognizing both unique and common linkages and can serve as a basis for a deeper understanding of the immunogenicity of bacterial carbohydrates and for designing targeted vaccines.

the analysis summarized in fig.  <dig> demonstrates that the most prevalent linkages in mammals are d-gal, d-man and d-glcnac as β1– <dig> donors to d-glcnac; d-glcnac as β1– <dig> donor to d-man; d-glcnac as β1– <dig> donor to d-gal; and d-man disaccharides with α1– <dig> or α1– <dig> linkages. these monosaccharides are sufficient to build up the common n- and o-glycan structures which dominate the mammalian database.

a complete list of mammalian disaccharide fragments found in glycosciences.de is available , where the data are encoded to illustrate the differences between our database findings and the data from ohtsubo & marth  <cit> . three disaccharides reported in  <cit> , namely d-glc d-gal, d-glca d-gal and d-glcnac d-glcnac, are absent from our databases. on the other hand, many existing mammalian disaccharides have not been mentioned by ohtsubo & marth, among them reasonably abundant ones such as d-glcnac d-galnac, d-glcnac d-man, d-glcnac d-man, and d-glcns l-idoa. the last disaccharide listed is present in more than  <dig> records of glycosciences.de for human carbohydrates and reported in the literature in association with sandhoff's disease  <cit> .

the disaccharide ensemble or total count of unique linkages is considerably larger for most of the bacterial classes compared to mammals, as shown in table  <dig>  for this analysis we have taken a total of  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> mammalian disaccharide fragments into account.

total count of all unique disaccharide linkages per taxonomic group. unknown anomeric and absolute configurations and fuzzily defined linkages are counted as distinct entities.

the abundance data for the more frequently occurring disaccharide linkage patterns found in mammals and/or bacteria are presented in table  <dig> . more comprehensive data  are presented in the additional material . in table  <dig> there are  <dig> disaccharide linkages listed which are found only in bacteria. the four most frequent of these, with abundances of  <dig> – <dig> %  are d-glc d-gal, d-gal d-gal, d-glc d-gal, and d-gal d-man. in table  <dig> there are five disaccharide types which occur in mammals only, and the most abundant of these  involve  α2– <dig> linkages from a neuraminic acid  to d-galnac or  α1– <dig> linkages from a uronic acid  to d-glcn-sulfate.

linkage types and relative abundances are shown as percentages  of the total disaccharide fragment count for mammals  or bacteria . linkages are listed only for disaccharide fragments present at >  <dig> % in either taxonomy group. values of  <dig>  indicate the presence of a linkage at <  <dig> %; missing values indicate the absence of that linkage type in the corresponding taxonomy group. an entry  denotes that the linkage was reported for mammals in  <cit>  but was not found in the databases. the percentages are cumulative for all ring types , all absolute configurations and for all anomeric configurations of the acceptor. for linkages that occur only in mammals or only in bacteria, those with abundences of  <dig> % or more are underlined.

the abundances of the most common bacterial disaccharide fragments are shown schematically in fig.  <dig>  where separate diagrams are presented for oligomers  and polymers  using the same color-coded linkage scheme as in fig.  <dig>  the residue names are sorted according to their abundance either as donors  or acceptors . the highest abundances in bacterial oligomers  are exhibited by the constituents of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide core region: l-gro-d-manhep→kdo and l-gro-d-manhep→l-gro-d-manhep. high abundances for l-rha→l-rha, d-man→d-man, d-gal→d-gal and d-glc→d-glc in fig. 12b arise from the homopolymeric regions prevalent in bacterial polymers.

a potential application of the information and methods outlined here is the design and validation of carbohydrate vaccines against bacterial pathogens. carbohydrate-based vaccines against haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae have already been licensed, and many similar products are in various stages of development. for example, the disaccharides d-glcd-gal and d-glcd-gal are not present in mammalian organisms accordingly to our analysis and are both constituents of the capsular polysaccharides of salmonella pneumonia, which were shown to be target candidates for vaccine development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we combined the bcsdb, the largest available bacterial carbohydrate database, with the glycosciences.de database to obtain a set of  <dig> nonredundant glycan/taxon pairs , of which  <dig> were assigned to bacteria and  <dig> to mammalia. the representative statistical analyses presented here reveal the basic principles of carbohydrate architecture in bacteria vs. mammals. the major monosaccharides which characterize different branches of the tree of life were extracted from the database and are in accordance with the published literature. several monosaccharides unique to certain subclasses of bacteria were identified and could prove useful as molecular markers for these classes. similarly, a variety of structural modifications of monosaccharides have been detected, and many of these are characteristic in that they may be either highly abundant or totally absent in individual taxonomic classes.

a linkage analysis was performed for all disaccharide fragments of bacterial and mammalian glycans and revealed that there are a number of abundant linkages as well as nonexistent linkages which may be useful for characterizing the various taxonomic groups. through a comparison of the disaccharide linkage ensembles or spaces for bacteria and mammals, one obtains an overview of those glycosyltransferase activities which are common to both classes and those which appear to be unique for mammals or bacteria or even for specific bacteria subclasses. thus, differential cross-species expression analysis is possible and may ultimately provide a deeper understanding of immunogenic patterns present in pathogenic bacteria.
