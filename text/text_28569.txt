BACKGROUND
hemoglobin, one of the most well-studied proteins to date, is responsible for oxygen transport from the lungs or gills to the tissues of vertebrates. the hemoglobin molecule is comprised of two α and two β subunits that non-covalently bond to form a tetramer  <cit> . the genes encoding the hemoglobin subunits are abundantly present and show relatively high similarity in structure  throughout the vertebrate lineage  <cit> . these characteristics, combined with the relative ease of isolating and studying hemoglobin proteins and their suspected role in adaptation to variable environmental conditions, have made the hemoglobin genes major targets for evolutionary studies  <cit> .

examinations of the genomic organization of chromosomal hemoglobin gene regions suggest that all hemoglobin genes evolved from a single monomeric form when gnathostome fish evolved from the more primitive agnathan fish approximately 500- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the entire hemoglobin gene region then appears to have undergone a series of tandem duplications and divergence, giving rise to the modern α and β hemoglobin genes. initially the α and β genes were adjacent on the same chromosome, and expansion of this region, including lineage-specific gene gain and loss, produced the multiple copies of α and β genes seen in gnathostomata today  <cit> .

the current genomic organization seen in mammals and birds is such that α and β hemoglobin gene clusters are located on different chromosomes and transcribed from the same strand in order of temporal expression  <cit> . the most parsimonious explanation of this arrangement involves a disruption in the α-β linkage by translocation of part of the hemoglobin gene cluster and subsequent gene silencing of α and β hemoglobins on respective chromosomes prior to the lineage leading to birds and mammals approximately 300- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . studies of the genomic organization of hemoglobin genes in the mammalian and avian lines examined this hypothesis by looking for evolutionary "footprints" of silenced hemoglobin genes as well as conservation and divergence patterns of genes surrounding the α and β gene clusters along the mammalian line  <cit> .

the disruption in the α and β hemoglobin gene linkage in mammals and birds appears to have occurred after their divergence from the poikilothermic jawed vertebrate taxa. rather, with the exception of some extreme cold-adapted antarctic icefish that retain only remnants of α hemoglobin genes and have completely lost the β hemoglobin genes, and thus do not express hemoglobin  <cit> , the fish and amphibians studied to date exhibit intermixed α and β hemoglobin genes on the same chromosome. for example, within the amphibian line, the genomes of both xenopus laevis and x. tropicalis exhibit linked α and β hemoglobin genes  <cit> .

the teleosts, or the ray-finned fish, are a diverse group that comprises most living species of fish, including more than  <dig>  extant species covering more than  <dig> orders  <cit> . despite significant differences in the number of hemoglobin genes and within-chromosome arrangements, model teleosts whose genomes have been studied to date, including the japanese pufferfish   <cit> , the zebrafish   <cit>  and medaka   <cit>  are reported to exhibit two hemoglobin gene clusters located on distinct chromosomes. these observations support the hypothesis that the teleost lineage experienced a whole genome duplication  event subsequent to the divergence from tetrapods  <cit> .

the salmonidae, a family of teleosts that includes the salmon, trout, charr, grayling and whitefish, are of considerable environmental, economic and social importance. indeed, more is known about the biology of salmonids than any other fish group  <cit> . the common ancestor of salmonids underwent a wgd event between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . thus, the extant salmonid species are considered pseudo-tetraploids whose genomes are in the process of reverting to a stable diploid state. the atlantic salmon  has been chosen as a representative salmonid for genomics studies, and an international collaboration to sequence the atlantic salmon genome has been established  <cit> .

wolff and gannon  <cit>  provided the first sequence of an atlantic salmon α hemoglobin from a kidney cdna library. subsequently, reports of the organization of the atlantic salmon hemoglobin gene cluster described six lambda phage genomic clones comprising two sets of α and β hemoglobin genes oriented 3' to 3' on opposite strands  <cit> . this was the first evidence of this type of hemoglobin gene arrangement for any vertebrate species. the six clones comprised four unique α hemoglobin gene sequences and six unique β hemoglobin genes, including a β hemoglobin containing the characteristic amino acid changes that eliminate the bohr effect, as well as one partial β hemoglobin gene   <cit> . it remained unknown, however, whether these represented all hemoglobin-like genes within the atlantic salmon genome. in addition, it was not known whether the clusters were on separate chromosomes, or whether, as would be predicted by the salmonid-specific 4r wgd hypothesis  <cit> , there were actually four hemoglobin gene clusters in salmon. furthermore, the relative locations and orders of the clones to one another were not established, and the sequences of intergenic regions as well as the genes surrounding the hemoglobins were not determined. finally, these investigations were not able to identify putative pseudogenes, incomplete hemoglobin genes or footprints of historical hemoglobin genes within the hemoglobin gene clusters or elsewhere in the genome. thus, a full characterization of the atlantic salmon hemoglobin gene repertoire is needed to provide insight to the evolution of the organization and function of the atlantic salmon hemoglobins, particularly in light of the teleost and salmonid-specific wgd events.

we used oligonucleotide probes specific for atlantic salmon α, β and non-bohr β hemoglobin genes as well as probes designed from rainbow trout  embryonic hemoglobin cdnas  <cit>  to locate these genes within the atlantic salmon bacterial artificial chromosome  library, chori- <dig>  <cit> . four bacs, representing two genomic locations on different chromosomes and comprising the entire altantic salmon hemoglobin gene repertoire were sequenced and annotated. fluorescence in situ hybridization  and linkage analyses were performed to assign these bacs to chromosomal locations within the atlantic salmon genome. here we present the first description of an entire salmonid α and β hemoglobin gene repertoire. we also discuss our results in terms of the fate of the hemoglobin genes during and after the salmonid wgd event, and how this fits into the evolution of the hemoglobin gene family in teleosts.

RESULTS
identification and tiling paths of atlantic salmon hemoglobin-containing bacs
all 32p-labelled 40-mer probes for α, β, non-bohr β and embryonic hemoglobins  hybridized to atlantic salmon bacs belonging to two fingerprint scaffolds , within the atlantic salmon physical map  <cit> . fps <dig> contains  <dig> bacs and spans an estimated  <dig>  kb; fps <dig> is comprised of  <dig> bacs spanning approximately  <dig>  mb. pcr was used to confirm the hybridization results and narrow down the regions within the fps that contained hemoglobin genes by screening all bacs surrounding the hybridization-positive bacs for the presence of hemoglobin genes. pcr primers were designed for sequence tag sites  within the bac-end sequences  of suspected overlapping bacs spanning the hemoglobin gene region, and overlaps were checked by pcr amplification of the sts within the putative overlapping bacs. the overlapping bacs s0014b <dig> and s0055h <dig> were determined to span the hemoglobin gene region of fps <dig>  while s0155c <dig> and s0079j <dig> spanned that of fps <dig>  thus creating bac tiling paths for the hemoglobin regions of these fps. individual shotgun libraries were generated for all four bacs and sequenced.

sequence assemblies and annotation
the chori- <dig> bac library was made from a diploid male atlantic salmon individual, meaning that bac inserts originated from either maternal or paternal chromosomes and therefore, overlapping bacs could exhibit allelic differences. this appeared to be the case for bacs s0014b <dig> and s0055h <dig>  for which the overlapping region covered the hemoglobin genes within fps <dig>  thus, although this overlapping section assembled into one contiguous section, reads containing allelic differences assembled into independent contigs that aligned to homologous regions along the solid contig. nevertheless, the full bacs assembled very well, and only three contigs >  <dig> bp and two gaps remained after hand finishing. these gaps presumably span repetitive regions in the atlantic salmon genome  <cit> . furthermore, given that the entire hemoglobin gene region was assembled with no gaps, it can be assumed that the six putatively functional α and six putatively functional β hemoglobin genes, two of which were defined as non-bohr β hemoglobins, along with the two putative α hemoglobin pseudogenes and three putative β hemoglobin pseudogenes that were annotated within fps <dig> represent all hemoglobin genes within that cluster . the total size of the assembly for the two bacs, not including allelic contigs , was  <dig>  bp, with approximately  <dig>  bp of overlap between them and the hemoglobin genes spanning approximately  <dig>  bp.

sequence reads from the overlapping region between the bacs s0155c <dig> and s0079j <dig> of fps <dig> assembled into one sequence contig with no apparent allelic differences. however, the remainder of the fps <dig> bacs proved much more difficult to assemble, and unfortunately, the repetitive nature of the sequences made it impossible to further improve the assembly by sequencing pcr products to fill gaps because we were unable to design specific pcr primers that would amplify a single product . thus, a total of  <dig> sequence contigs >  <dig> bp remained after hand-finishing of the assembly. the relative orders of some of the sequence contigs of fps <dig> were determined by matching paired-ends of sequence shotgun clones. six sequence contigs contained hemoglobin genes, and the relative order of these fps <dig> contigs with respect to one another was estimated by aligning the contigs against the completed assembly of the two bacs from fps <dig>  this was based on the assumption, given the highly similar nature of the non-coding regions, as well as that of the genes flanking the globins, that there has not been a major disruption in the form of an inversion to either of the hemoglobin regions . our sequence annotation identified seven putatively functional α hemoglobin genes and one putative α hemoglobin pseudogene, as well as eight putatively functional β hemoglobin genes, four of which were defined as non-bohr β hemoglobins, and three putative β hemoglobin pseudogenes within the fps <dig> hemoglobin bacs . this, however, must be considered a minimum estimate of hemoglobin genes within this region given the possibility that gaps between sequence contigs could contain additional hemoglobin genes. the total size of the assembled sequence contigs for the two bacs was  <dig>  bp, with approximately  <dig>  bp of overlap. the hemoglobin genes spanned approximately  <dig>  bp not including gaps between contigs.

all sequences were deposited in the ncbi genbank database with the assembled sequence contigs for bacs s0155c <dig> and s0079j <dig>  under the accession number gq <dig> and those for bacs s0055h <dig> and s0014b <dig>  under the accession number gq <dig> 

all previously published atlantic salmon hemoglobin sequences  <cit>  were identified within the annotated hemoglobin clusters; however, there were two examples of possible allelic differences. specifically, clone  <dig> α hemoglobin  exhibited 99% similarity at the nucleotide level to ssachr6α <dig>  which resulted in one amino acid change from a methionine to a leucine at amino acid  <dig>  and the clone  <dig> and clone  <dig> β hemoglobins  showed 99% similarity at the nucleotide level with ssachr6β <dig>  which resulted in one amino acid change from valine to leucine at amino acid  <dig>  however, as both of these changes were caused by single nucleotide substitutions, each resulting in a single amino acid change, and given the depth of sequencing coverage of the atlantic salmon bacs , it is more probable that they reflect sequencing errors in the published clones rather than allelic differences.

to provide further evidence that the two atlantic salmon hemoglobin gene clusters encompassed all previously identified atlantic salmon α and β hemoglobin genes, we compared all identified putatively functional atlantic salmon hemoglobin genes against all full-length atlantic salmon cdna clones  <cit> . indeed, all unique full-length cdna clones annotated as β hemoglobins were accounted for within the identified putatively functional β hemoglobin genes. this was also true for the α hemoglobins, with the exception of the cdna clones with accession numbers bt <dig>  and bt <dig> , which are highly similar to one another but not to the identified hemoglobins. an alignment of these clones using blastn  <cit>  against the nr/nt database revealed similarity to hemoglobin subunit α-d, a distinct type of hemoglobin present in birds, mammals and reptiles that is predicted to have arisen via duplication from a gene that had larval/embryonic function  <cit> . this gene is apparently found in atlantic salmon given the presence of the ests, but is not in the regions of the α and β hemoglobin genes.

additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> lists all annotated α hemoglobin genes  and β hemoglobin genes  with the source chromosome, strand of transcription, start location, whether the entire hemoglobin gene matches one of the atlantic salmon hemoglobin clones published by mcmorrow et al.  <cit>  at the amino acid level. it also identifies which genes are non-bohr β hemoglobins, and lists the top hemoglobin est cluster hit, if any, with the percent identity from the salmonid est database  <cit>  and whether the hemoglobin matches one of the full-length cdna clones with the corresponding ncbi accession number. table s2c  lists all putative pseudogenes with the chromosome name, strand of transcription, start location and a description of each exon, with explanations of why the gene was classified as a pseudogene.

the identified putatively functional α hemoglobin genes ssachr6α <dig> ssachr3α <dig> as well as the β genes ssachr6β <dig>  ssachr6β <dig>  ssachr6β <dig>  ssachr6β <dig>  ssachr3β <dig>  ssachr3β <dig> and ssachr3β <dig> did not have matching est clones. this could mean that these represent newly identified hemoglobin genes, or that these genes are rarely or never transcribed and thus are not represented in the atlantic salmon cdna libraries. interestingly, several of these genes lie in regions where the tail-to-tail alternating order of the hemoglobin genes is disrupted and they would be transcribed on opposite strands than expected . future studies using expression profiling of the atlantic salmon transcriptome at various time points throughout the species' life cycle will provide further insight to this.

conservation of gene order and strand of transcription
wagner et al.  <cit>  first reported the tail-to-tail orientation and alternating order of the atlantic salmon α and β hemoglobin genes. we found that this orientation was fairly well conserved, with the α hemoglobins transcribed on the negative strand and β hemoglobins transcribed on the positive strand, and the alternating α-β order was mostly maintained in both chromosomes with some notable exceptions. on chromosome  <dig> , the alternating α-β pattern is conserved throughout , but there are some apparent disruptions to the strand of transcription at the 5' end of the cluster. specifically, ssachr6β <dig> as well as all putative β hemoglobin pseudogenes, including ssachr6βψ <dig>  ssachr6βψ <dig>  ssachr6βψ <dig>  were predicted as being transcribed from the negative strand, whereas all putative α hemoglobin pseudogenes  as well as ssachr6α <dig> would be transcribed on the positive strand . on chromosome  <dig> , the β hemoglobin pseudogene ssachr3βψ <dig> as well as the putatively functional genes ssachr3β <dig> and ssachr3β <dig> were predicted to be transcribed from the negative strand, and ssachr3βψ <dig> and ssachr3βψ <dig> disrupt the otherwise conserved alternating α-β order and orientation of the genes, ssachr3β <dig> and ssachr3β <dig> being adjacent . in terms of α hemoglobin genes on chromosome  <dig>  ssachr3αψ <dig> and ssachr3α <dig> were predicted as transcribed in the positive direction, whereas all others are transcribed on the negative strand. note again that, for chromosome  <dig>  the order and orientation of the sequence contigs was predicted based on homology with that of chromosome  <dig> . thus, it is possible that inversions or rearrangements may have taken place, and that the resulting predicted order and orientation of the hemoglobin genes is incorrect.

as indicated above, it is interesting to note that all of the putatively functional α hemoglobin genes predicted to be transcribed from the positive strand and all β hemoglobin genes predicted to be transcribed from the negative strand are lacking a corresponding est at this time. it is possible that the apparent rearrangements have contributed to a global shutdown of transcription in these regions of the genome, allowing several of the hemoglobin genes to degenerate into obvious pseudogenes and silencing the remainder. this should be further explored using expression profiling by qpcr across all life stages of atlantic salmon.

linkage analysis and karyotyping
microsatellite marker ssa10067bsfu, representing fps <dig> was informative in both the atlantic salmon salmap families   <cit>  and was mapped to linkage group  <dig>  microsatellite ssa0516bsfu was informative in the br <dig> family and mapped to linkage group  <dig> . fish analysis revealed that fps <dig> is found within atlantic chromosome  <dig> and fps <dig> is within chromosome  <dig> . the fish and linkage mapping of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> to linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, contributed to the integration of the atlantic salmon karyotype and linkage map  <cit> . primer sequences for the microsatellite markers used for linkage analysis are provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> and within asalbase, the atlantic salmon genomic database  <cit> .

comparative genomic analysis of hemoglobin gene regions in other teleosts
we examined the regions surrounding the hemoglobin gene clusters in the available teleost genomes and compared them against one another as well as to those predicted to surround the atlantic salmon hemoglobin gene clusters to gain insight to the nature of the teleostean hemoglobin gene containing chromosomes. we found that the genes surrounding the hemoglobin gene clusters are well conserved. figure  <dig> shows a schematic diagram of the hemoglobin gene regions and the predicted surrounding named genes in medaka, zebrafish, stickleback and tetraodon compared to those of atlantic salmon. note that, for the hemoglobin gene containing bacs within atlantic salmon chromosome  <dig>  only the order and orientation of the sequence contigs that aligned with those from the bacs within chromosome  <dig> could be predicted. that is, given the extensive overlap between the two bacs that cover fps <dig> , the total sequenced region is much shorter than that of fps <dig> ; therefore, any sequence contigs from fps <dig> that did not fall within the coverage of fps <dig> could not be ordered or oriented. thus, for any sequence contigs that fell outside of this region, we were only able to establish their relative location compared to those that aligned with chromosome  <dig> based on their source bac. within figure  <dig>  solid lines between predicted genes indicate that the order and orientation of the predicted gene relative to those neighboring it is known, whereas a single black dot between predicted genes indicates that the relative location of the predicted genes compared to those joined by solid lines is known, but their order and orientation  relative to one another is not. arrows in figure  <dig> indicate the direction of transcription of the gene relative to the location of the hemoglobin gene cluster; lack of an arrow indicates that the relative direction of transcription cannot be determined.

briefly, medaka, zebrafish and tetraodon and atlantic salmon exhibit two distinct hemoglobin gene clusters on separate chromosomes or linkage groups, whereas stickleback has only one. although there are some rearrangements in terms of the positioning of genes relative to the hemoglobin genes and direction of transcription as well as some apparent gains, losses and duplications of genes, all of the organisms possess one similar cluster  that contains, among others, the shared genes upf <dig> protein c16orf <dig>  rhomboid family member  <dig>  dedicator of cytokinesis protein  <dig>  elav-like protein  <dig> and dna-3-methyladenine glycosylase . note these results are consistent with those of patel et al.  <cit> , who report that mpg and c16orf <dig> surround the α hemoglobin gene cluster in frog, chicken and human, and one of the α and β hemoglobin clusters in platypus and opposum. however, whereas this cluster appears twice in atlantic salmon, the second cluster in zebrafish, tetraodon and medaka  is characterized by a different set of shared genes; specifically, the presence of aquaporin- <dig> and rho-gtpase-activating protein, although tetraodon is lacking the former and zebrafish is lacking the latter. in addition, tetraodon exhibits a copy of rhomboid family member  <dig> on cluster  <dig> as well as cluster  <dig>  stickleback and atlantic salmon, however, appear to have lost cluster  <dig> entirely. instead, the stickleback genome only has one hemoglobin cluster , whereas that of altantic salmon shows two copies of cluster  <dig> 

a dot plot generated using the jdotter software  <cit>  comparing the sequenced bacs from atlantic salmon chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> showed that the regions surrounding the hemoglobin genes are > 95% similar between the two chromosomes, with variations only within the hemoglobin gene regions . this further suggests that the two atlantic salmon hemoglobin gene containing chromosomes or regions are homeologous . thus, we hypothesize that the wgd at the base of the teleost lineage produced cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig>  which remain in the zebrafish, medaka and tetraodon lineages, that cluster  <dig> was lost in the stickleback lineage, and that cluster  <dig> was lost within the salmonid lineage prior to the wgd, which yielded two copies of cluster  <dig>  this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the atlantic salmon chromosome arms 3q and 6q  share nine duplicated genetic markers  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of teleostean hemoglobin genes
the results of the phylogentic analysis  suggest that the hemoglobin genes cluster according to functional similarity, which corresponds to sequence similarity. this is expected given the high sequence similarity and short nature of the hemoglobin genes. specifically, in figure  <dig>  all of the non-bohr α hemoglobin genes  form a distinct clade with no other hemoglobin genes, further supporting that there are no β globin genes lacking the bohr effect in the other fish species examined . additionally, many genes that were annotated as embryonic within ensembl  clustered closely, which provides some suggestion as to candidate atlantic salmon embryonic hemoglobin genes .

in both trees, the x. tropicalis hemoglobin genes formed their own clade, although they did not form distinct outgroups, which again, may be a function of the high similarity between the hemoglobin genes across species. all annotated medaka, zebrafish, stickleback and tetraodon α and β hemoglobin genes that were used to generate the phylogenetic trees  are provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> by species with the corresponding name assigned by us for comparison purposes , as well as the ensembl gene id, chromosome/linkage group, start and stop location and strand of transcription.

discussion
number of hemoglobin gene clusters and whole genome duplications
notably, there are not four clusters of hemoglobin genes in atlantic salmon even though the hemoglobin clusters were already duplicated within the teleost lineage prior to the salmonid-specific wgd event that took place between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . furthermore, our comparative genomic analysis, as well as the high similarity in the non-coding regions of the two fps, suggests that atlantic salmon exhibit a duplicated copy of one cluster , and are missing the second cluster , which is still seen in medaka, zebrafish and tetraodon . figure  <dig> shows a schematic diagram of the predicted genes surrounding the hemoglobin genes in atlantic salmon as well as four annotated teleost genomes, while figure  <dig> depicts the phylogenetic relationships of the studied teleost fishes , and illustrates our hypothesis of the evolutionary events that took place to produce the observed chromosomal arrangements of the teleost hemoglobin genes. with respect to the other teleosts studied, subsequent to the teleost wgd, which produced clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  zebrafish and medaka and tetraodon appear to have maintained both hemoglobin gene clusters, whereas stickleback and atlantic salmon have lost cluster  <dig>  in addition, zebrafish exhibits an apparent inversion in cluster  <dig> such that elav-like protein  <dig> is located on the opposite side of the hemoglobin genes, far downstream from rhomboid family member  <dig> with several unshared genes between them. within the tetraodon genome, cluster  <dig> also exhibits some shuffling compared to those of the other genomes, and, interestingly, contains rhomboid family member  <dig>  which is also found on cluster  <dig>  these relationships will be clarified by further analysis and in-depth annotation of the full-length hemoglobin gene repertoires of other teleost species as more of them undergo full genome sequencing.

with respect to the salmonid lineage, we propose that atlantic salmon lost cluster  <dig> prior to the salmonid-specific wgd, which duplicated cluster  <dig>  thus producing the two copies of cluster  <dig> and lack of cluster  <dig> seen within the atlantic salmon genome today. we also recognize the possibility of an alternative pathway, which involves tetraploidization of hemoglobin gene clusters  <dig> and  <dig> as predicted by the salmonid-specific wgd , followed by subsequent loss of both copies of cluster  <dig> within the salmonid lineage. however, this involves two separate excision events subsequent to the salmonid wgd, whereas the former hypothesis only involves one such event prior to the salmonid wgd, and is thus the more parsimonious route. note that the loss of the two clusters must have taken place by excision of the entire regions or chromosome loss as opposed to gradual degradation of the hemoglobin genes or gene silencing, or we would have expected our hemoglobin probes to hybridize to footprints of old hemoglobin clusters in other regions of the genome.

conservation of order and orientation of α and β hemoglobin genes
the tail-to-tail orientation and alternating order of the α and β hemoglobin genes were fairly well conserved throughout both hemoglobin gene clusters, although both hemoglobin gene clusters exhibited some apparent disruptions to these patterns . however, given that no hemoglobin gene footprints or ghost genes could be found within these regions, we predict that these changes took place via gradual shuffling, gene loss via excision and pseudogenization over time. such lineage-specific gains and loses of hemoglobin genes have also been reported throughout the mammalian lineage  <cit> 

number of hemoglobin genes in atlantic salmon
our results revealed that the atlantic salmon genome contains substantially more paralogous α and β hemoglobin gene copies than previously published  <cit> . furthermore, there are more copies of the α and β hemoglobin genes within the atlantic salmon genome than in other teleosts whose genomes have been sequenced. specifically, of the teleost genomes examined, that of zebrafish contains the most hemoglobin genes, with six β hemoglobin genes and seven α hemoglobin genes, compared to  <dig> and  <dig> putatively functional α and β hemoglobin genes, respectively, in atlantic salmon. note, however, that some of the putatively functional hemoglobin genes do not have an est associated with them, perhaps suggesting that the actual number of functional genes should be reduced accordingly. however, this would still leave the atlantic salmon with more α and β hemoglobin genes than any of the other teleosts examined to date.

numerous reports suggest that mammalian hemoglobin levels are implicated in the increased oxygen affinity of blood in situations of adaptation to altitude-induced hypoxia , thus suggesting that hemoglobin levels contribute to survival in low oxygen environments. further, hoffman et al.  <cit>  suggest that variation in hemoglobin gene copy number may be a source of regulatory variation affecting physiological differences in blood oxygen transport and aerobic energy metabolism in mammals. indeed, it has been proposed that the capacity of fish to colonize a wide range of habitats is directly related to their hemoglobin systems  <cit> . in addition, a study using real-time quantitative pcr demonstrated that hypoxic conditions induce complex responses in hemoglobin gene expression in zebrafish  <cit> . thus, the extensive array of hemoglobins in atlantic salmon may reflect the diverse range of environmental conditions that an individual salmon must endure throughout its lifecycle as it migrates from freshwater streams to open ocean and back.

identification of β hemoglobins lacking the bohr effect
the bohr effect is the phenomenon that the affinity of hemoglobin for o <dig> is affected by ph. specifically, an increase in the blood pco <dig> shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, resulting in the release of o <dig> and thereby enabling more efficient gas exchange between blood and tissues. this is the result of the oxy-deoxy conformational change and allosteric interactions between o <dig> and h+/co <dig> binding sites of the hemoglobin molecule. hemoglobin molecules lacking the bohr effect are able to retain o <dig> under conditions of elevated acidity caused by increased oxygen consumption  <cit> . therefore, the non-bohr hemoglobin may function as an emergency oxygen supplier when an organism is exercising vigorously, such as when a fish is escaping a predator, catching prey, or swimming against a current.

the bohr effect depends on the intricate arrangement and interactions of all cation and anion binding sites in the hemoglobin molecule and involves a number of contributing amino acid groups that have not yet been fully elucidated  <cit> . indeed, a comparison of mammalian, avian and teleost fish hemoglobins suggested that several different histidine and non-histidine sites contribute to the bohr effect in different species to varying degrees  <cit> . it is widely accepted, however, that a greater overall histidine content in the hemoglobin molecule correlates with an increased bohr effect  <cit> , with the c-terminal histidine residue accounting for up to 50% of the effect  <cit> . in atlantic salmon, the non-bohr β hemoglobin exhibits phenylalanine at this position  <cit> . in addition, in atlantic salmon, the non-bohr β hemoglobin has  <dig> amino acids , including the initiator methoinine, and the amino acid at position  <dig> is alanine  <cit> . we used these three characteristics to identify a total of six putatively functional non-bohr β hemoglobin genes within the atlantic salmon genome . conversely, no β hemoglobin genes identified within the medaka, zebrafish, stickleback or tetraodon genomes exhibited all three of these hallmarks of the non-bohr β hemoglobin. in addition, a recent pcr-based exploration of the atlantic cod genome found no β hemoglobin genes exhibiting these characteristics  <cit> , implying an absence of the non-bohr hemoglobins in this species. all of the atlantic salmon non-bohr β hemoglobins formed a distinct clade in the phylogenetic analysis, which reflects their common structural elements and therefore highly similar sequences, and lends further support to the finding that no other fish species examined possesses non-bohr hemoglobin genes .

this apparently high number of non-bohr β hemoglobin gene copies within the atlantic salmon genome may be attributable to the atlantic salmon life history, with its extensive migratory range and the need to swim upstream into fresh water habitats to spawn. in contrast, all of the model teleosts studied so far inhabit relatively consistent environments with little variation in depth, temperature or salinity. additionally, although atlantic cod, a non-model teleost that does not appear to possess non-bohr β hemoglobin genes, inhabit depths from the surface up to  <dig> m and undertake seasonal migration, at no point in their lifecycle do they inhabit freshwater  <cit> . thus, future studies of the hemoglobin gene repertoires of other migratory salmonids, such as the pacific salmon species, as well as land-locked freshwater salmonids, in addition to expression profiling of hemoglobin genes at different life stages will provide further insight to this phenomenon.

embryonic hemoglobin genes
to date, there has been no published study examining temporal expression of hemoglobin genes in atlantic salmon. indeed, the most closely related species for which this has been done is rainbow trout  <cit> , for which there is no published genome sequence as well as no comprehensive examination of the rainbow trout hemoglobin repertoire such as this one. given the complex life history of salmon and the lack of available expression data, we could not confidently assign the title of embryonic to any atlantic salmon hemoglobins at this time. however, it is noteworthy that ssachr3α <dig> and ssachr6α <dig> form a clade with omyα2emb, as well as omyα1emb and an embryonic danio rerio α globin, drechr3α5emb , and that ssachr3α <dig> and ssachr6α <dig> cluster closely with this clade. figure  <dig> shows that ssachr3β <dig>  ssachr6β <dig>  ssachr3β <dig> and ssachr6β <dig> form a clade with omyβ1emb. these phylogenetic relationships suggest that these atlantic salmon hemoglobin genes may be embryonic. also worth noting is that all of these are the first genes in the 5'-3' direction on their respective chromosomes. in mammals, temporal expression of hemoglobin genes correlates with spatial location on the chromosome, with the first upstream hemoglobin gene being the first expressed  <cit> . this further suggests that these genes  encode candidate embryonic hemoglobins. however, further analysis, in particular, detailed expression profiling of hemoglobin genes during all life stages, is required to examine these hypotheses.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that, despite the atlantic salmon genome having gone through at least two wgd events relative to tetrapods, which would result in four predicted hemoglobin gene clusters, only two such clusters were present. furthermore, the atlantic salmon genome appears to exhibit two copies of one of the duplicated ancestral teleost hemoglobin gene clusters, and has presumably lost the other cluster. we also found that the atlantic salmon genome harbors substantially more hemoglobin genes than the other teleosts for which the hemoglobin gene repertoires have been identified, and that they possess several hemoglobin genes that appear to encode non- bohr β hemoglobins. we suggest that these characteristics of the atlantic salmon hemoglobin genes reflect the dynamic life history of atlantic salmon.
