BACKGROUND
neural crest cells  represent a multi-potent embryonic cell population that generates a very diverse range of cell types including cranial nerves, neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, enteric neurons, melanocytes, cranial bones and cartilages  <cit> . the first ncc appear at the neurula stage in the neural plate border region. as the neural tube closes in mouse, ncc delaminate from the regions of neural plate border and ectomesenchyme after epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and migrate to various developing organs. the very broad differentiation potential of ncc provides a complex model of cell type specification and migration and the gene regulatory network determining the spatiotemporal control of ncc diversification has been extensively studied. for instance, the ncc population is specified by the set of transcription factors sox <dig>  sox <dig>  foxd <dig>  snai <dig> together with msx <dig>  pax3/ <dig> or zic <dig> in the neural plate border  <cit> . these effector genes are regulated by coordinated action of signaling pathways such as wnt, bmp and fgf from the adjacent paraxial mesoderm and non-neural ectoderm  <cit> . the differentiation potential of ncc is spatially determined by their position along the rostrocaudal axis. in a simplified view, cranial ncc coming from mesencephalic and rhombencephalic regions generate head bones, cartilages, cranial nerves and selected connective tissues  <cit> . vagal ncc from the area of somites 1- <dig> are destined to the enteric nervous system. cardiac ncc  are involved in septation of the cardiac outflow tract  <cit>  and trunk ncc form sensory and sympathetic ganglia. the current debate, however, favors the scenario proposing that originally multi-potent ncc stem cells are exposed to different environmental cues along the rostrocaudal axis that spatiotemporally restrict their differentiation potential  <cit> .

meis proteins are transcription factors that are orthologous to the drosophila homothorax  protein. they contain a tale  sub-class of the homeodomain that binds to dna. in humans and mice, three homologues meis <dig>  meis <dig> and meis <dig> have been identified  <cit>  and it has been shown that they directly bind to pbx proteins . the meis/pbx protein complex binds to dna through respective meis- and pbx-consensus binding sites thereby regulating transcription. the meis/pbx complex plays important roles during development of several organs including limbs  <cit> , heart  <cit> , lens  <cit> , pancreas  <cit>  and hindbrain . hox genes are among the target genes of meis-pbx control via modulation of histone acetylation indicating recruitment of hox proteins as cofactors of meis-pbx complex  <cit> .

mice lacking meis <dig> display liver hypoplasia, hemorrhage, impaired erythropoiesis and eye defects, and die by the embryonic day   <dig>   <cit> . although a substantial amount of data have been reported on the role of meis <dig> in organogenesis, hematopoiesis and leukemia induction, the function of the other homologs, meis <dig> and meis <dig>  is much less clear. chicken meis <dig> has a specific role in determining cell fate in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary by controlling the expression of otx <dig>  <cit>  and it also affects proliferation of retinal progenitor cells  <cit> . several recent reports in various model systems indicated that meis <dig> may play a role in neural crest cells. meis <dig> was identified as one of the key transcription factors in the gene regulatory network driving differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards cardiovascular cell types, and this was further confirmed by knock-down experiments in zebrafish  <cit> . morpholino-based screens in zebrafish revealed the importance of meis <dig> and meis <dig> factors during craniofacial development  <cit> . moreover, gene expression analysis of emt in endocardial cushions identified meis <dig> among enriched genes  <cit> . in this context it is very interesting that some human disorders displaying cleft palate and heart developmental defects have been linked to mutations in the meis <dig> locus . nonetheless, a clear picture of the meis <dig> function based on a genetic mouse model is still missing.

in the present study, we examined the role of meis <dig> during embryogenesis by generating conditional knock-out mice. we studied morphological defects after either zygotic inactivation of the meis <dig> allele or ncc-specific conditional knock-out using ap2α-ires-cre. we conclude that hemorrhaging most probably causes embryonic lethality. further, many embryonic defects in the tissues derived from neural crest in systemic meis2-nulls were recapitulated upon conditional deletion of meis <dig> in ncc suggesting an indispensable role of meis <dig> in ncc.

RESULTS
meis2-/- embryos are lethal and display hemorrhaging
a conditional mutant allele of the meis <dig> gene  was created by inserting loxp sites in the introns  <dig> and  <dig> that flank exons  <dig> and  <dig> in the meis <dig> gene . to generate mutant mice lacking functional meis <dig> in the whole organism, meis <dig> cko were at first crossed with the hprt1-cre mice  that exert a zygotic expression of cre recombinase facilitating gene excision in all tissues. the first generation mice, which were heterozygous for the meis <dig> gene , were intercrossed to obtain meis2-null  animals. animals were genotyped using primers flanking loxp sites as depicted in fig. 1a. the loss of exons 3- <dig> in meis2-/- embryos was tested by pcr . the absence of meis <dig> protein was verified using western blot analysis of protein extracts from e <dig>  embryos . meis2-/- mice displayed embryonic lethality between e <dig> -e <dig>  and suffered from hemorrhaging . the size of mutant embryos was smaller at e <dig>  as mutant embryos stopped growing approximately at e <dig>  when hemorrhaging became prominent. although the severity of this phenotype varied among meis2-/- , all mutants displayed bleeding and a small liver size .fig.  <dig> generation of meis <dig> -/- mice. a scheme of the meis <dig> gene with  <dig> exons  and position of loxp sites for cre recombination. the homeodomain  is encoded by exons 7- <dig>  b meis2-null  embryos were obtained by crossing meis <dig> cko with hprt1-cre mice. left: genotyping of meis2-/- embryos using primers loxf, frtf and frtr illustrated in  . right: western blot analysis of e <dig>  whole-embryo protein extracts with an anti-meis <dig> antibody. c mutant meis <dig> mouse embryos at e <dig>  display severe hemorrhaging. d the embryonic heart at e <dig> with persistent truncus arteriosus  in which the aortic and pulmonary arteries are not separated in meis2-/-. a dashed line depicts the crossing of the separated aorta and pulmonary artery in the wild-type heart while this is not visible in the mutant outflow tract. e immunohistochemical staining of meis <dig> in the embryonic heart at e <dig>  illustrating its strong expression in the aortic  and pulmonary valves . aortic and pulmonary valves are missing in meis <dig> mutants . f α-smooth muscle actin  staining on transverse sections showing persistent truncus arteriosus with the fused aorta  and pulmonary artery  in meis2-/-. ao, ascending and descending aorta; pa, pulmonary artery; pta, persistent truncus arteriosus



a detailed inspection of internal organs in mutant embryos revealed that the liver was the most impaired organ with a destructed cellular organization in large regions . these impaired regions contained almost no erythrocytes labelled with ter <dig> but many apoptotic cells as shown by tunel assay . surprisingly, meis <dig> was not found to be expressed in the fetal liver while meis <dig> was readily detectable . based on this we suggest that the observed cell death in the liver is a consequence of strong hemorrhaging in the whole embryo that leads to anemia and apoptosis primarily in the liver and may be a cause of the embryonic lethality. having observed anemia in meis2-/- embryos we further pursued the possibility that meis <dig> may influence embryonic hematopoiesis similarly to meis <dig> that controls proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in the fetal liver and is also essential for megakaryocyte viability  <cit> . we therefore mapped the expression of meis <dig> and meis <dig> in the area of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros , the site of origin of embryonic hematopoietic stem cells. as shown in additional file 1: figure s2b, neither meis <dig> nor meis <dig> were observed in endothelial cells labelled with cd <dig> but both proteins were abundant in the mesenchyme surrounding the endothelial wall of the dorsal aorta. we further found that circulating hematopoietic progenitors labeled with anti-runx <dig> antibody did not express meis <dig> . finally, we carried out erythroblast cultures derived from the fetal liver and found no differences in the growth and differentiation of liver erythroid progenitors between meis2-/- and controls . as meis <dig>  in our hands, was not detected in hematopoietic progenitors neither in the agm nor in the fetal liver, we hypothesize that the anemia in the mutants originates from extensive bleeding or defective circulation rather than defects in hematopoiesis.

the lack of meis <dig> results in fetal heart malformation
in the heart of meis2-/- embryos at e <dig> , we observed incomplete septation of the outflow tract that normally separates the aorta from the pulmonary artery. this defect is known as persistent truncus arteriosus  and was observed in all analyzed mutants  . to correlate the observed defects with the expression of meis <dig>  we carried out immunohistochemistry on sections of embryonic heart at e <dig> using anti-meis <dig> antibody. as shown in fig. 1e, a remarkably strong presence of meis <dig> was observed in the aortic and pulmonary valves. strikingly, these valves were lost in the meis2-/- heart . to visualize the pta in the meis2-/- outflow tract, we used antibody against α-smooth muscle actin . stained heart sections confirmed the pta but sma appeared normally expressed in the mutant heart .

widespread expression of meis <dig> was observed in the developing embryo including the central nervous system, in the upper and lower jaw and in the lumen of the intestinal tract . specifically in the heart, meis <dig> protein was detected in the myocardium  and pericardium   in which meis2-positive cells also expressed sarcomeric actin . remarkably strong expression of meis <dig> was found in the valves  as well as in the atrioventricular cushion .fig.  <dig> mapping of meis <dig> expression in the mouse embryo at e <dig>  meis <dig> protein is present in many developing tissues including the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, spinal cord, myocardium, cardiac cushions, cardiac outflow tract, valves .  a sagittal section of the whole embryo with a detail of the heart  documenting meis <dig> presence in the myocardium  and pericardium .  transverse sections of the heart at e <dig> from rostral to caudal with details of the framed areas  illustrating strong meis <dig> expression in cardiac valves.  immunofluorescent labeling of sarcomeric actin in the wild-type heart at e <dig>   double labeling of sarcomeric actin  and meis <dig> , a higher magnification view on the framed area in  showing meis <dig> in the myocardium  and in the atrioventricular cushion. ao, aorta; av, aortic valve;, pv, pulmonary valve; mv, mitral valve; avc, atrioventricular cushion



to document heart defects in meis2-/- embryos in detail, we performed immunofluorescence on transverse and sagittal sections from embryos at e <dig>  using antibodies against meis <dig>  α-smooth muscle actin  and heart-specific myosin myl <dig>  figure 3a-c illustrates that the aortic and pulmonary arteries were not separated  and the aortic valve was absent . these regions strongly expressed meis <dig> in the controls and the signal was lost in the mutants . both the aortico-pulmonary spiral septum and the aortic and pulmonary valves are formed from from cardiac neural crest cells  <cit>  which can be visualized by anti-sox <dig> and anti-twist <dig> antibody  <cit> . in meis2-/- embryonic hearts, we observed less sox9-positive cells in the outflow valves. the number of twist1-positive cells was not significantly changed though its expression level was reduced and the organization of these cells was altered compared to controls . clear morphological defects in the septation of the truncus arteriosus and in the outflow valves  strongly suggest that the defective outflow tract in meis <dig> nulls arises from impaired cardiac neural crest cells.fig.  <dig> immunohistochemistry of transverse and sagittal sections at e <dig>  from the embryonic heart in meis2-/- mice and controls. a anti-meis <dig> antibody staining  show strong expression in the pulmonary and aortic valve. the aortic valve is absent in the mutants lacking meis <dig> . b α-smooth muscle actin  staining showing the persistent truncus arteriosus  with the fused aorta and pulmonary artery . sagittal sections document a shortened heart length and a malformed pulmonary valve. c heart-specific myosin light chain  <dig>  staining shows normal cell specification in the myocardium in meis <dig> nulls and, again, absent aortic and abnormal pulmonary valve on transverse and sagittal sections, respectively. d left: decrease of sox9-positive cells in the valves in the outflow tract in meis <dig> nulls. right: the level of twist <dig> expression in the condensed mesenchyme in the pulmonary valve and in the tricuspid valve appears normal in the mutants but it clearly reveals severe morphological changes in oft. av, aortic valve; pv, pulmonary valve; tv, tricuspid valve; ao, aorta; pa, pulmonary artery



neural crest cells express high levels of meis2
based on the heart abnormalities of potential neural crest origin, we decided to map the expression of meis <dig> at the embryonic stages that are critical for generation and migration of ncc. at e <dig>  before the neural tube closure, abundant meis <dig> expression was noticed in the neural plate that weakened towards the plate border from which the premigratory ncc delaminate . at e <dig> , the meis <dig> protein was found in the neuroepithelium of the hindbrain  in which the signal became diminished towards the roof plate. meis <dig> was also seen in migrating cells in the mesenchyme lateral to the hindbrain and in the pharyngeal arches 1- <dig>   and in the outflow tract  . many of these cells especially in the pa co-express tfap <dig>  a marker of ncc  <cit>  . at e <dig> , meis <dig> protein was detected in the developing tissues that are derived from ncc, such as the trigeminal and facial nerve ganglions, in the the otic vesicle and its surrounding mesenchyme, in the maxillary and mandibular component of the pa <dig>  in the cardiac outflow tract cushion and in the pa <dig> . the expression pattern revealed by our immunohistochemistry thus corresponds to in situ hybridization of meis <dig> mrna reported by cecconi and co-workers  <cit> . apart from the neuroectoderm, many of meis2-positive cells displayed a mesenchymal character as revealed by co-staining with the anti-twist <dig> antibody .fig.  <dig> meis <dig> is expressed in migrating ncc.  meis <dig> expression in the neural plate stage at e <dig>  becomes weak towards the neural plate border . right: schematic embryo at e <dig>  with a depicted section plane .  sections from rostral  to caudal  of wild-type embryos at e <dig>  revealing meis <dig> in pharyngeal arches , hindbrain  and in the cardiac outflow tract .  immunofluorescent double-labeling of meis <dig>  and tfap <dig>  in the region approximately depicted by a black rectangle in a’.  transverse sections from rostral to caudal at e <dig>  with immunostained meis <dig>  sections levels correspond to the illustrated cartoon. meis <dig> was detected in the hindbrain , forebrain , optic cup , trigeminal nerve ganglion , otic vesicle , facial nerve ganglion , maxillary  and mandibular  process of pa <dig>  in pa <dig> and outflow tract .  immunofluorescence of meis <dig>  and twist <dig>  shows their co-expression in two areas labelled with rectangles in d”’. upper panels  belong to the lateral zone  and lower panels  to the midline area 



conditional deletion of meis <dig> in neural crest cells leads to a defective heart outflow tract
because some developmental defects in meis <dig> nulls may arise from affected ncc, we aimed to verify this assumption by means of conditional inactivation of meis <dig>  we employed ap2α-ires-cre  transgenic mouse in which cre recombinase was inserted into the tfap <dig>  gene enabling loxp recombination specifically in ncc  <cit> . conditional mutants ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko survived the critical stage e <dig>  at which systemic meis <dig> nulls die, but they were lethal around the time of birth. this cko approach also allowed us to analyze older embryos. to perform lineage tracing experiments and examine migratory routes of ncc, conditional mutants ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko were crossed to rosa <dig> reporter mice  <cit> . this allele allows detection of cre-mediated recombination using β-galactosidase enzymatic assay and tracing of all cells derived from ap2α-cre positive ncc. figure 5a-a’ illustrates lineage tracing of ncc in normal and ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko embryos. 75 % of mutants  displayed aberrant distribution of β-galactosidase-positive cells along the neural tube , and all mutants had abnormalities in the pa <dig>  which appeared thinner and misshaped,  and also all mutants had smaller otic vesicles . sectioning of ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> e <dig>  embryos revealed poor colonization of the oft by cardiac ncc . conditional deletion of meis <dig> effectively erased the meis <dig> protein in the regions of the ap2α-cre activity, however, many surrounding cells still express normal levels of meis <dig> . next we studied the oft defects at later stages using immunohistochemistry on cryosections from ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> embryos. at e <dig>  anti-sox <dig> antibody labelled all β-galactosidase-positive cells in the oft and we observed a lower density and disorganization of double-labelled cells in conditional mutants . 90 % of mutants had malformed oft valves at e <dig>  . however, the septation of the truncus arteriosus appeared normal in conditional mutants as the aorta and pulmonary arteries were normally separated , which was never seen in systemic nulls all displaying the pta. of note, we detected still high levels of meis <dig> in non-recombined cells, including the smooth muscle of artery walls and in the vicinity of valves, which may provide explanation for less severe defects in conditional mutants compared to systemic ones. finally, fig. 5g-g’ shows an example of valve malformation at e <dig> known as double outlet right ventricle  labelled with anti-sox <dig>  in summary, tissue-specific deletion of meis <dig> using ap2α-cre resulted in various valve defects in the heart outflow tract documenting its critical role in cardiac ncc.fig.  <dig> heart defects upon conditional inactivation of meis <dig> in ncc.  lineage tracing of ncc in ap2α-cre /meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> embryos at e <dig>   and controls .  sections of embryos shown in  at the level of pa <dig> and oft, compare position and number of β-galactosidase-positive cells in the control and the mutant cko .  immunohistochemical staining of meis <dig> in cko  shows the areas of its deletion.  cryosetions of the oft from ap2α-cre /meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> stained for β-galactosidase and sox <dig>  note cells disorganization in cko .  paraffin-embedded sections of e <dig> heart stained with anti-sox <dig> defective aortic valve in cko .  meis <dig> and β-galactosidase double-labeling of e <dig> oft shows a number of meis2-positive cells in cko  that are excluded from cre recombined areas. the pulmonary valve does not develop properly.  anti-sox <dig> immunohistochemical labeling of severed valves in cko at e <dig> . ao, aorta; av, aortic valve; oft, outflow tract; pa <dig>  pharyngeal arch 2; pa, pulmonary artery, dorv, double outlet right ventricle



meis <dig> affects cranial nerve development
as meis <dig> expression is abundant in the head region, we next explored other ncc derivatives such as cranial nerves. formation of their neuronal projections in meis2-/- embryos was followed using whole-mount immunostaining of neurofilaments with the 2h <dig> antibody. as seen in fig. 6a-b’, the trigeminal , facial  and vestibulocochlear  nerves  were severely impaired in meis <dig> nulls at e <dig>  . an analogous analysis was performed in ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko. we again crossed conditional mutants with rosa <dig> reporters to map the activity of cre. β-galactosidase signal in ap2α-cre/rosa <dig> controls was seen in trigeminal ganglions, the lens, the periocular mesenchyme and the surface ectoderm. a similar spatial pattern in this head region was found in the mutants ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> and the size of the trigeminal ganglion v was smaller and misshapen . 2h <dig> neurofilament staining showed that the cranial nerves vii and viii were damaged in conditional mutants  but the trigeminal nerve v again less affected than in meis2-/- . thus, the phenotype in cranial nerves appeared weaker in conditional mutants in comparison with systemic ones. we further noticed that the cornea and eyelids were not developed properly  . the cornea was much thinner  while eye lids  did not grow and close over the eye bulbs. the cornea was reported to originate from ncc  as also indicated by our lineage tracing data showing ap2α-cre activity in the periocular mesenchyme . in summary, tissue-specific deletion of meis <dig> in ncc and the surface ectoderm resulted in malformed cranial nerves, the cornea and eyelids.fig.  <dig> the absence of meis <dig> leads to perturbed development of cranial nerves.  neurofilament staining using 2h <dig> antibody revealed absent or abnormally positioned cranial nerves trigeminal v, facial vii and vestibulocochlear viii in meis2-/-.  a detail of the framed areas in  showing severed nerves v, vii .  lineage tracing of ncc in ap2α-cre /meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> embryos at e <dig>  and controls. transverse head sections in the eye area.  neurofilament 2h <dig> staining of cko embryos at e <dig>  with impaired nerves vii and viii .  hematoxylin-eosin staining of the eye from cko at e <dig> shows shrunken eyelids  and cornea . cranial nerves iii, v, vii, viii, x; el, eye lid; oc, optic cup; pm, periocular mesenchyme



development of cranial cartilage is perturbed in meis2-null embryos
next, we examined the development of the craniofacial skeleton that is derived from ncc. mapping of ap2α-cre/rosa <dig> showed complete recombination in pa <dig> and otic vesicle at e <dig> and this was further verified at e <dig> on sagittal view in which recombined cells resided in jaws and the nasal cartilage . immunostaining of the meis <dig> protein confirmed efficient deletion in ap2α-cre /meis <dig> cko in the regions of cre recombination . we found abnormal palate  and tongue  in sagittal sections of e <dig> conditional mutants . the size of tongue was greatly reduced and muscle fibers looked disorganized, as shown in a detailed view on transverse sections . in 33 % of mutants , severely malformed developing cartilage were observed in the palate , 67 % of mutants also displayed abnormal palates though less severe. further, the otic capsule cartilage was absent as shown by alcian staining at e <dig> . submandibular gland  was missing in 33 % mutants and 66 % had much smaller smg  . we carried out whole-mount alcian blue/alizarin red staining at e <dig>  that confirmed our observations from tissue sections: the mandibular bone was poorly developed and its length was much shorter in the mutants . the interparietal bone and the cartilage of the otic capsule were absent and the boundary of ossification of the parietal bone was abnormal . the hyoid bone was severely malformed . these defects clearly document that meis <dig> is essential for the head bones and cartilages that originate from cranial ncc.fig.  <dig> conditional inactivation of meis <dig> in ncc affects osteochondrogenesis in the head.  illustration of the zone of cre activity visualized in ap2α-cre/rosa <dig> embryos, left: transverse section of e <dig>  embryo, right: sagittal view on e <dig> .  meis <dig> immnunostaining of ap2α-cre/meis2cko embryos at e <dig> , transverse sections in the region of hindbrain and the first pharyngeal arch. compare the area of meis <dig> deletion with a comparable cryosection from ap2α-cre /meis <dig> cko/rosa <dig> in the left panel .  sagittal sections from cko at e <dig>  hematoxylin-eosin  staining. note the abnormal palate  and tongue .  a higher magnification of the tongue on transverse sections at e <dig> documents its much reduced size and tissue disorganization.  an example of severely disrupted palate  in some cko embryos, transverse section h&e staining. alcian staining of cartilage at e <dig> with no otic capsule in cko.  submandibular gland is almost absent and tongue muscle severed, transverse sections.  alizarin red/alcian blue staining of e <dig>  heads. side view with remarkably shorter mandible , absent interparietal bone, abnormal hyoid bone and otic capsule cartilage. ossification frontline of the parietal bone is severed in the mutants .  ventral views showing an abnormal hyoid bone . oc, otic capsule cartilage; ip, interparietal bone; hy, hyoid bone; mb, mandible, p, palate; pr, parietal bone; smg, submandibular gland; t, tongue



meis <dig> does not affect proliferation and expression of main determinants of ncc
migrating ncc are exposed to a number of environmental factors that can alter their properties including fate restriction or proliferation. in order to class meis <dig> into the gene regulatory network determining ncc development we first examined the levels of expression of well-known genes specifying ncc. trigeminal ganglions stained with anti-pax <dig> were found reduced in size or completely missing in meis2-/- embryos at e <dig> . conditional mutants showed normal levels of pax <dig> and a normal size of ganglions v . pax <dig> was reported to control colonization of the oft by cardiac ncc  <cit>  and the promoter of pax <dig> is directly controlled by pbx <dig>  <cit> . as pbx1-/- embryos display similar heart defects as meis2-/- embryos  <cit> , we checked the expression of pax <dig> in the oft and pa <dig> of our mutants. however, we found no change in pax3-positive cells in pa <dig>  moreover, pax <dig> was not detected in the oft even in wild-type controls . next we assayed the level of expression of tfap <dig>  sox <dig> and mitf, a marker of melanocyte precursors. as shown in fig. 8c-f’, their expression was not found to be changed in the absence of meis <dig> fig.  <dig> expression of ncc markers in the absence of meis <dig>   pax <dig> immnostaining of trigeminal ganglions in systemic meis2-/- e <dig>  embryos showing greatly reduced or even absent ganglions v.  pax <dig> in the second pharyngeal arch .  tfap <dig> immunostaining in meis2-/- embryos at e <dig> .  sox <dig> immunofluorescence of ganglions v at e <dig> .  melanocytes stained with anti-mitf were detected normally in meis <dig> nulls.  sox <dig> in dorsal root ganglia and the peripheral nervous system was not changed in mutants. drg, dorsal root ganglia; h, hindbrain; v, trigeminal ganglion; pa <dig>  the second pharyngeal arch;, sc, spinal cord



we also analyzed the number and spatial distribution of migrating ncc using anti-sox <dig> antibody at e <dig> . sox9-positive ncc are abundant in the embryonic head mesenchyme and pharyngeal arches, however, their quantification did not reveal significant changes between controls and mutants . further, we examined cell proliferation using antibodies against pcna and ph <dig> on head sections. again, quantification of all proliferating cells  or proliferating ncc  did not differ between controls and mutants . finally, apoptosis, as measured by anti-cas <dig> immunohistochemistry at e <dig> , was not significantly altered in the mutants . in summary, meis <dig> absence did not result in dramatic changes in cell proliferation and viability at e <dig> .

systemic meis <dig> mutants show aberrant position of foxd <dig> and sox9
as the defects in ncc derivatives in the absence of meis <dig> were not caused most probably by insufficient cell proliferation or changed expression of main ncc specifiers we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization to map the position of migrating ncc. at first, e <dig>  embryos from meis2-/- embryos and control littermates were stained with riboprobes for foxd <dig> and sox <dig> mrna  <cit> . as shown in fig. 9a-b, both foxd <dig> and sox <dig> were expressed in meis2-/- embryos at the levels that were comparable to control littermates, indicating again that the overall differentiation program of ncc was not affected. interestingly, we observed an aberrant position of foxd3-positive cranial ncc in meis <dig> nulls . expression of foxd <dig> mrna in the trigeminal ganglion confirmed its abnormality as also seen in fig. 6b’. sox <dig> mrna revealed that otic vesicles were consistently smaller in mutants . next, we carried out the same analysis in e <dig>  embryos from conditional mutants ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko. however, the levels and distribution foxd <dig> and sox <dig> transcripts were not altered in conditional mutants  . thus, the changes in the expression pattern of ncc specifying genes sox <dig> and foxd <dig> were found to be more profound in systemic meis <dig> mutants compared to conditional ones which may explain their stronger phenotypic defects.fig.  <dig> expression of neural crest cell specifier genes foxd <dig> and sox <dig> in the absence of meis <dig>   in situ hybridization of foxd <dig> on e <dig>  meis2-/- embryos and controls with an abnormal position of migrating ncc in the midline of the midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord .  sox <dig> mrna staining at e <dig>  with ectopic cells in the midline  and smaller otic vesicles  in systemic mutants.  in situ hybridization of neural crest cell specifier mrna foxd <dig> and sox <dig>  in conditional ap2α-cre/meis2cko at e <dig> . side and corresponding dorsal view magnifications illustrate no change in their expression in conditional mutants



discussion
in this study, we showed that the transcription factor meis <dig> is abundant in ncc and it is essential for their function. the embryonic lethal phenotypes of mutant mouse embryos of meis <dig> and its paralogue meis <dig> are similar in the timing of death and in strong hemorrhaging. meis <dig> is expressed hematopoietic stem cells in the fetal liver, the primary organ of hematopoiesis at e <dig>  various assays showed defects in erythropoiesis providing explanation for anemia in meis <dig> mutants  <cit> . in contrast, we did not detect meis <dig> in the fetal liver and in hematopoietic progenitors in the dorsal aorta. we therefore speculate that hemorrhaging in meis2-/- embryos caused destructive changes primarily in the fetal liver that is highly sensitive to low oxygen. impaired function of the liver may lead to failure in erythropoiesis and thus bleeding rather than defects in hematopoiesis in meis <dig> mutants may cause lethality. despite 83 % sequence identity of meis <dig> and meis <dig> and the almost identical homeodomain, they acquired different functions during evolution probably due to distinct expression patterns.

stankunas and colleagues  <cit>  showed that various combinations of mutant alleles of pbx1/2/ <dig> or meis <dig> exhibit cardiac anomalies in the outflow tract or in the septation of ventricles implying that cardiac ncc require transcriptional control by combinatory meis/pbx complexes. along this line, zebrafish meis <dig> genes influence development of heart and cranial skeleton  <cit> . the data presented here extend our knowledge about the role of meis/pbx complexes controling the fate of ncc. apart from the previously proposed function in cardiac neural crest, we suggest that a similar transcriptional control network takes place in cranial ncc including chondrogenic and neuronal lineages. our data represent the first loss-of-function study of meis <dig> in mouse and may in fact serve as a disease model for certain human developmental disorders. intriguingly, several reports describe patients with meis <dig> mutations who display disorders such as the cleft palate, septal defects in the heart or intellectual disabilities .

pax <dig> is expressed in the neural plate border and plays an important role in cardiac ncc as documented by conditional knock-out studies in mouse  <cit> . a specific pbx1/meis <dig> complex has been reported to directly regulate pax <dig> in premigratory ncc in rhombomeres, in which cardiac ncc originate, linking pbx1-pax <dig> regulatory hierarchy with the oft defects in pbx1-/- embryos  <cit> . we did not see reduced pax <dig> expression in meis2-/- at e <dig>  although pax3-positive trigeminal ganglions were shrunken in systemic mutants. nor could we detect pax <dig> in the wild-type oft at e <dig> . it is possible that meis <dig> and pax <dig> are co-expressed in earlier ncc in which these factors may cooperate during ncc differentiation.

our experiments utilizing conditional mutants ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko confirm defects in tissues derived from cardiac and cranial ncc such as the oft or craniofacial cartilage. however, the phenotypes in cko appeared in some cases weaker than in systemic mutants. pta, for instance, was never found in conditional mutants while all systemic mutants displayed defective septation of the oft. it is important to note that we still found a substantial amount of meis <dig> protein after conditional deletion in the areas that are in close vicinity of ap2α-cre targeted regions  in which we observed effective inactivation. standby meis2-positive cells may be involved in forming the truncus septum. although ap2α-cre mouse is the earliest driver for ncc  <cit> , we cannot exclude the possibility that a minor ncc population forms before ap2α-cre mediated recombination and thus it is not targeted. another possibility is that neighboring non-ncc cells expressing meis <dig> participate in the truncus septation. in this context it is interesting to note that systemic pax <dig> ko display the pta while wnt1-cre or ap2α-cre ckos of pax <dig> show valve defects but normal separation of aorta and pulmonary arteries  <cit> . moreover, the pta defects were also seen in systemic pbx1- <dig> mutants; the data from pbx ckos are not available  <cit> . the fact that the truncus septation may partially originate from non-ncc population is supported by the report of bai and colleagues  <cit>  who observed pta in mef2c-cre/bmp4/ <dig>  a cre driver not normally used for ncc targeting.

altered proliferation, apoptosis or significant changes in expression of transcription factors determining ncc  were not detected between critical stages e <dig> -e <dig>  in our hands. meis <dig> may influence late phases of ncc differentiation  that is required for proper formation of the oft or for differentiation of osteochondral progenitors.

we hypothesize that meis <dig> absence may be compensated by meis <dig> which may rescue some defects during earlier phases of ncc development. meis <dig> deficiency is thus reflected in the areas and stages in which the meis <dig> function is unique, e.g. during craniofacial development. meis proteins may diversify in their expression pattern after the initial ncc specification and acquire unique function, for instance, during formation of the oft and cartilage. in order to test this hypothesis it will be necessary to generate and analyze meis <dig> and meis <dig> conditional double mutants that may reveal potentially earlier role of meis factors during ncc development.

even though we did not see a major difference in sox <dig> expression in early embryos, anomalies in the craniofacial skeleton of wnt1-cre/sox <dig> cko  <cit>  and our ap2α-cre/meis <dig> cko are similar in the mandible, tongue, the otic capsule and the hyoid bone. this suggests that sox <dig> and meis <dig> cooperate in a similar differentiation process during chondrogenesis. it remains to be elucidated what genes are direct targets of meis factors. altogether, our loss-of-function studies show that meis <dig> transcription is an important player in the gene regulatory network determining differentiation of cardiac and cranial ncc.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a pioneering functional description of meis <dig>  a member of tale-class homeodomain transcription factors, which is strongly expressed in cranial neural crest cells. we generated a conditional allele of the meis <dig> gene. using systemic and neural crest-specific inactivation of meis <dig>  we provide evidence that meis <dig> is an important player in the regulatory network controlling cranial and cardiac neural crest cells.
