BACKGROUND
theobroma cacao l. , which is native to the amazonian basin of south america  <cit> , is a perennial tree that belongs to the malvaceae sensu lato  <cit>  and has a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 2x =  <dig>  <cit> . recently, two cacao genomes have been published. ‘b97-61/b2’, a member of the criollo genetic group, has an estimated genome size of  <dig> mbp  <cit>  whereas the ‘matina 1–6’ genome, a member of the amelonado genetic group and more representative of the cacao that is cultivated worldwide, has an estimated genome size of  <dig> mbp  <cit> .

witches’ broom disease , which causes significant losses, is only present in south america and in the caribbean  <cit>  and was first reported in  <dig> by the explorer alexandre rodrigues in the brazilian amazon basin  <cit> . the fungus moniliophthora perniciosa  aime & phillips-mora is a basidiomycete and produces basidiocarps, which emerge from dry brooms in the form of mushroom-like structures. direct production losses are due to infected mature pods and flower cushions causing parthenocarpic fruits, thereby reducing significantly the potential production  <cit> .

a major source of resistance was found in the clones ‘scavina 6’  and ‘scavina 12’   <cit>  and in two other clones, ‘cab 208’ and ‘cab 214’, which are genetically different from ‘sca 6’  <cit> . qtl associated with resistance to vegetative brooms  have been identified in three mapping populations. the first population was developed by selfing one tree, ‘tsh 516’, which was obtained from a cross between the resistant ‘sca 6’ and the susceptible ‘ics 1’. a major qtl was identified on chromosome ix , whereas a minor qtl was identified on chromosome i  <cit> . the two other populations consist of the progenies of a cross between the susceptible ‘ics 39’ and the resistant ‘cab 208’ and of a cross between ‘ics 39’ and the resistant ‘cab 214’  <cit> . one qtl was identified on chromosome ix and is located at a slightly different position than the qtl that was identified in the f <dig> mapping population of ‘sca 6’ × ‘ics 1’. two other qtl were identified on chromosomes iv and viii  <cit> .

one of the main requirements of an efficient marker-assisted selection  program is to have reliable markers associated with traits of interest. the availability of dense genetic linkage maps is one of the prerequisites. the first linkage map in cacao, which contained  <dig> markers, was published in  <dig>  <cit> . this reference map was improved over time through the addition of more trees and markers . the most recent consensus map, which also has the highest marker density, combined the data of the cross ‘upa402’ × ‘uf676’ and of the f <dig> mapping population resulting from selfing a single tree of the cross ‘sca 6’ × ‘ics 1’. this map contains  <dig>  co-segregating markers and has a length of  <dig>  cm  <cit> .

here, we describe the development of a dense genetic linkage map using single nucleotide polymorphisms  based on  <dig> trees of a cross between the wbd-resistant ‘tsh 1188’ and the tolerant ‘ccn 51’ at the mars center for cocoa science  in barro preto, bahia, brazil. furthermore, we identified seven qtl on five different chromosomes that are associated with wbd using a multi-trait qtl analysis for outbreeders. various potential candidate genes that were identified within the qtl may be involved in different steps in disease resistance. potential snp markers that can be applied in the marker-assisted selection of wbd-resistant material are proposed.

methods
plant material and design of the field experiment
for this study, a segregating population ‘mp01’ consisting of  <dig> offspring from a cross between ‘tsh 1188’ and ‘ccn 51’ was used. both parents are very different for various traits of interest and the offspring segregates for pod color  <cit> , self-compatibility, resistance to wbd, black pod and ceratocystis wilt, fat content and fat composition, methylxanthines , flavanol content and some other agronomic traits. ‘tsh 1188’ is considered resistant to wbd, whereas ‘ccn 51’ is considered moderately resistant. a recent study focused on the number of cushion brooms showed that ‘tsh 1188’ had about 3 % infected flower cushions, whereas ‘ccn 51’ has close to 30 % infected flower cushions  <cit> . individual trees were planted in  <dig> in a 3 ×  <dig> m grid in a hydromorphic and typical tropudalf  mixed soil type. every fifth row in the field contained 5– <dig> trees  of the variety ‘comum’, which is susceptible to wbd and serves as a natural and permanent inoculum source. the layout of the field experiment is shown in additional file  <dig>  shade was provided using the traditional ‘cabruca’ system in which the trees are grown amongst the atlantic forest's native canopies.

snp identification, snp array evaluation and genotyping of trees using the illumina infinium snp chip
dna for genotyping was isolated from leaf samples according to the protocol described by motamayor et al.  <cit> . the snps that were used on the cacao illumina infinium snp chip were identified as part of the work to identify conserved ortholog set ii  snp markers for mas in cacao as described by kuhn et al.  <cit>  and livingstone et al.  <cit> . the strategy was to sequence leaf rna samples of  <dig> members of a panel of diverse cacao genotypes and to align the sequences against the theobroma cacao matina 1– <dig> leaf transcriptome. after alignment, a variant report was generated for all of the identified snps  <cit> . further filtering of the snps was performed to select the final  <dig>  snps to produce the 6 k snp chip  <cit> . of the  <dig>  snps that were submitted for inclusion on the bead array,  <dig>  were successfully synthesized. failing to produce genotypic data for any sample,  <dig> snps were removed before analysis. additionally, to serve as a quality control for genotype calling, only the markers with gentrain and 10 % gencall scores greater than  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were included for data analysis. this process resulted in a final set of  <dig>  snps. the cacao6ksnp array was originally run with  <dig>  dna samples , but seven dna samples failed completely. in total,  <dig>  snps were genotyped in  <dig>  dna samples for a total of  <dig> , <dig> data points or snp genotypes  <cit> .

snp genotype data analysis and construction of a genetic map
joinmap® <dig>   <cit>  was used to create the genetic map. snps with more than 5 % missing data were discarded. snps were also checked for strongly deviating segregation ratios. for each linkage group, the marker data were analyzed per segregation type . finally, integrated genetic maps were obtained using the maximum likelihood  mapping algorithm  <cit> . markers with a nearest-neighbor stress greater than  <dig> were discarded, followed by recalculation of the marker order. map distances were calculated using the haldane mapping function and the resulting maps were drawn using mapchart  <dig>   <cit> .

phenotypic evaluation of wbd resistance
vb and cushion brooms  were counted once or twice a year over a period of 4 years  and removed after they had been counted. the data from the  <dig> genotyped trees were recorded as the number of vb per year and the number of cb per year.

qtl analysis
the distributions of the numbers of vb and cb per year were extremely skewed with many zeros. therefore, the presence/absence of brooms, being the main feature of the phenotypic variation, was used for further analysis. to get an indication of the genetic component of variation for the number of vb and cb over time, determination coefficients were calculated from the variance components for genotypes and the genotype-by-year interaction using the reml facilities of genstat  <dig>  <cit> .

the number of years in which each tree carried vb and the number of years in which it carried cb were used for further analysis; the values for each of these traits varied between zero and four. to remove the effect of possible spatial patterns of infestation by wbd, the data was adjusted for row and column effects using the reml facilities of genstat  <dig>  <cit> . the adjusted data of the two traits was used for a multi-trait qtl analysis  <cit> , which was carried out using the facilities for qtl analysis in genstat  <dig>  the qtl profiles were obtained using all of the available markers using the integrated linkage map. the values of the test statistic ) are based on the additive effect of ‘tsh 1188’, the additive effect of ‘ccn 51’, and the interaction effect. the initial selection of qtl was performed by simple interval mapping using a threshold of three for the -log <dig>  and the final selection of qtl was performed by backward elimination using the default parameters provided by genstat.

to obtain a better sense of the precision of the qtl positions and their usefulness for cacao breeding, a simulation study was carried out in which random samples of  <dig> individuals were drawn from the original  <dig> individuals. for each sample, a qtl analysis was carried out as described above. the sample size of  <dig> was chosen as a reasonable size compared to the population size of many qtl experiments. for each sample, the marker positions that were selected as qtl were recorded as ‘hit’. the results of  <dig> random samples were stored, and a graphical display of the results was obtained using the procedure dqsqtlscan of genstat  <dig> 

identification of associations between haplotypes and wbd resistance
haplotypes of the offspring and the parental haplotypes surrounding the snp markers on each chromosome with a significant association with wbd resistance in the qtl analysis were identified using version  <dig>  of the matina 1– <dig> genome and ixora  <cit> . to test the significance of the haplotype-phenotype associations, a chi-squared test was applied independently for each identified marker, based on the number of total vb as a trait, where the trees with more than  <dig> brooms were considered susceptible. ‘tsh 1188’ has two parental haplotypes that are designated as t <dig> and t <dig>  whereas ‘ccn 51’ has the two parental haplotypes, c <dig> and c <dig>  chi-squared tests were also used to test whether the parental haplotype combinations that were present in the offspring  were non-randomly associated with wbd resistance.

origin of disease resistance alleles
the phasing of  <dig> individuals including three mapping populations and a set of diversity panel members  <cit>  from distinct t. cacao structural groups was run with fastphase  <cit> . sixty-two markers  in the wbd qtl <dig>  region were used for the phasing. to improve the accuracy of phasing and to account for haplotype structure, a subpopulation label was used in the form of an integer. known members that were sampled from the same population  were assigned the same population, while unrelated individuals were assigned a distinct integer. the expectation-maximization  algorithm for computing the maximum likelihoods was controlled by the following options:  <dig> random starts,  <dig> iterations, and  <dig> haplotypes that were sampled from the posterior distribution from a particular random start. the default allelic two-parameter error model for inferring true genotypes was also used to scan for genotype errors. to create the phylogenetic neighbor joining  tree, thirty diversity panel members were chosen, including the parents from mp <dig>  catie type  <dig>  and png mapping populations  <cit> . the distance matrix for phylogeny estimation was created with the mega  <dig> phylogeny reconstruction setting, using the method of maximum composite likelihood using  <dig> bootstrap samples  <cit> .

candidate gene identification
using the location of the identified snp markers with the highest association in the qtl analysis and the gene annotations in the version  <dig>  matina 1– <dig> genome  <cit> , a search was performed manually for possible candidate genes involved in disease resistance. the specific keywords that were searched for were resistance, senescence, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid , ethylene , gibberellic acid, auxin, reactive oxygen species , mitogen-activated protein kinases , f-box, lrr-receptor, cysteine, serine/threonine protein kinase, phosphatase, ubiquitin, npr <dig>  and wrky. all of the genes within an interval of approximately 2 cm surrounding the most significant marker for each qtl were investigated in more detail using blastx and additional literature study. all details about the experimental set-up and data analysis for the differential gene expression of a subset of candidate genes are given in the additional file  <dig> and in additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
construction of the integrated genetic map and relationship with the physical map
for the construction of the mp <dig> map,  <dig>  segregating snps could be scored:  <dig>  snps were classified as segregating in ‘tsh 1188’ ,  <dig>  snps as segregating in ‘ccn 51’  and  <dig>  as segregating in both parents . eleven snps were discarded because they had more than 5 % missing data. nine snps that were classified as segregating in both parents were discarded because for these markers, the offspring individuals were scored in only two classes instead of three, leaving  <dig>  snps for further analysis. using a recombination frequency threshold of  <dig> , ten major linkage groups were formed. one marker from chromosome iii  was discarded because it was unlinked from other markers of the same segregation type. additionally,  <dig> markers were removed after map inspection because of nearest neighbor stress  values greater than  <dig>  cm . an overview of the map construction process is given in table  <dig>  as an example, additional file  <dig> shows the agreement between the linkage maps for chromosome ix that were obtained with markers of the segregation types ‘ab × aa’, ‘ab × ab’ and ‘aa × ab’ and the integrated map of chromosome ix. the integrated linkage maps for every chromosome are shown in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> an overview of the mapping process


asome markers were removed from the final map because of nearest neighbour stress  values greater than  <dig> , of which three markers on chromosome iii, three markers on chromosome v, and  <dig> markers on chromosome ix

fig.  <dig> integrated linkage map of mp <dig>  the integrated linkage map is based on a population of  <dig> individuals obtained from a cross between ‘tsh 188’ and ‘ccn 51’. the linkage map contains  <dig>  snps with segregation types ab × aa , aa × ab  and ab × ab 



compared to the most recent map  <cit> , the mp <dig> map contains three times more markers , has a map length that is 12 % longer  and has a marker density that is three times denser . the shortest chromosome was chromosome vii , and the longest chromosome was chromosome ix . the average gap without snp markers was  <dig>  cm, with the smallest gap of  <dig>  cm on chromosomes iii and viii and the largest gap of  <dig>  cm on chromosome x. the average distance between two markers varied from  <dig>  cm on chromosome iv to  <dig>  cm on chromosome x . in contrast to the previously published studies , no distorted segregation ratios were observed; all snps of the type ‘ab × aa’ and ‘aa × ab’ showed a segregation ratio between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the relationship between the positions of the snps on the integrated linkage map and the corresponding position on the physical map is shown in additional file  <dig>  apart from a few deviating points, a nearly perfect correspondence exists between the linkage map and the physical map. all ten chromosomes show physical regions with reduced recombination rates, presumably the centromeric regions, which agrees with the karyotyping results and demonstrates the lack of a long arm for some of the chromosomes and that chromosomes vi, vii, viii and x are shorter than the other chromosomes  <cit> .

phenotypic evaluation of wbd resistance
‘tsh 1188’ is considered resistant to wbd, whereas ‘ccn 51’ is considered moderately resistant. a recent study in mp <dig> focused on the number of cushion brooms showed that ‘tsh 1188’ had about 3 % infected flower cushions, whereas ‘ccn 51’ had close to 30 % infected flower cushions  <cit> . nowadays we notice that ‘ccn 51’ has many more infected flower cushions located on the stem and the lower part of the main branches, compared to ‘tsh 1188’, but the latter one seems to have more infected flower cushions higher up in the canopy. nevertheless, the number of vegetative brooms is much lower in ‘tsh  <dig> than in ‘ccn 51’. it is also noteworthy that both clones are as good as resistant for wb infection of the pods. there also exist region-specific differences, which are most likely associated with differences in existing pathogen strains. it is therefore important to mention that the outcome of a plant-pathogen interaction does not depend solely on the plant genotype and it may change completely depending on the strain of the pathogen.

for each genotype, the total numbers of vb and cb per year were used . for both traits, the distributions were highly skewed and contained many zeros. the average number of vb per year ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the average number of cb per year ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the maximum number of vb per year ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the maximum number of cb per year ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . over time, the percentage of trees actually carrying brooms varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for vb and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for cb . therefore, we focused on the presence or absence of brooms rather than on their actual numbers . the coefficients of determination based on the presence/absence were  <dig>  for vb and  <dig>  for cb, indicating that slightly more than half of the variation in genotypic means  can be attributed to differences between the genotypes. it should be noted here that genotypes are confounded with positions in the field, so that the genetic part of the coefficient of determination may be considerably lower than the values found. due to possible spatial patterns of infestation, the data were adjusted for row and column effects, and the adjusted data were used for the qtl analysis .table  <dig> proportions of trees in mp <dig> with vegetative brooms and cushion brooms in the years 2008–2011



identification of qtl for wbd resistance
the multi-trait qtl analysis identified various qtl, but after backward selection on vb and cb  seven positions on five different chromosomes were retained as potential qtl . all seven positions exhibited qtl effects that differ in the two traits under study. a summary of the results after backward elimination is shown in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> graphical results of the multi-trait qtl analysis. the multi-trait qtl analysis on vb and cb, adjusted for row and column effects in the experimental set-up. the markers associated with the qtl after backward selection are pointing towards the selected peaks

the additive effect of ‘tsh 1188’  represents the average difference in response between individuals with the allele of the first grandparent ‘tsh-1188’  and the allele of the second grandparent of ‘tsh 1188’ . the interaction ‘tsh-1188’ × ‘ccn-51’ represents the average difference in response between individuals with the allele of the first grandparent of ‘tsh-1188’ and the allele of the second grandparent ‘tsh-1188’ in combination with the allele of the first grandparent of ‘ccn 51’ and the same average difference in combination with the allele of the second grandparent of ‘ccn 51’. the figures between brackets represent standard errors. the designation as first and second grandparent depends on the phasing of the marker alleles and determined during the construction of the linkage map. the values in bold are values that are at least two times larger than their standard error

the major qtl  on chromosome ix most likely corresponds to the qtl identified in the f <dig> population obtained by selfing an individual of a cross between the wbd-resistant ‘sca 6’ and the wbd-susceptible ‘ics 1’ . this result might not be surprising because ‘sca 6’ is present in the parental lineage of ‘tsh 1188’. ‘tsh 1188’ results from a cross between ‘pound 18’ and ‘tsh 753’  <cit> ; ‘tsh 753’ is the result of an open-pollination of ‘tsa 641’  <cit> , and ‘tsa 641’ is the result of a cross between ‘sca 6’ and ‘imc 67’  <cit> . the second qtl on chromosome ix had an additive effect in both ‘tsh 1188’ and ‘ccn 51’ for vb, but had an effect only in ‘ccn 51’ for cb. other ‘ccn 51’ specific effects for cb were identified for the qtl on chromosome iii and on chromosome iv. similar effects in ‘ccn 51’ for various other qtl were noticed, indicating that these newly discovered qtl might contribute to the known moderate resistance/tolerance of ‘ccn 51’ to wbd and can be used as alternative sources of resistance. ‘ccn 51’ is derived from crosses involving ‘imc 67’ and ‘ics 95’  <cit> . ‘imc 67’ shows resistance or susceptibility to wbd according to different studies  <cit> , whereas ‘ics 95’ has intermediate resistance  <cit> . at mccs, the two clones show an intermediate level of resistance to wbd. the fact that about 10–17 % of the trees in the offspring doesn’t have any cb or vb , suggests that they may have a combination of favorable alleles originating from ‘sca 6’, ‘imc 67’ and ‘ics 95’. the higher number of resistant trees  in mp <dig> might indicate that they have a combination of favorable alleles from any of these three clones. a preliminary study performed by santos et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> ssrs  on  <dig> trees  of a subset of  <dig> trees of mp <dig> under natural and artificial infection pressure with m. perniciosa. a simple regression analysis indicated that in addition to the known markers on chromosome ix, there were also markers that showed an association with resistance on chromosomes i, iii and iv. the markers on chromosomes iii and ix were from the ‘tsh 1188’ parent, whereas the markers on chromosomes i and iv were from the ‘ccn 51’ parent, most likely indicating an additional source of resistance  <cit> . in the present study, however, no qtl were located at chromosome i. the identified qtl on chromosomes iii and iv were located on the opposite side of the chromosomes compared to our results. alternative qtl were identified in ‘cab 208’ and ‘cab 214’, which were originally collected from the brazilian amazon and did not correspond to the qtl that were identified in this study  <cit> . these results suggest that there are multiple sources of resistance in the different mapping populations for both vb and cb. to better understand the precision of the qtl positions and their usefulness for cacao breeding, a resampling study was carried out in which random samples of  <dig> individuals were drawn  <dig> times from the original  <dig> individuals, and the results are shown in additional file  <dig>  the sample size of  <dig> individuals was chosen because most of the published qtl results in cacao are based on a population size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> individuals . for the region between  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm of chromosome ix, the average percentage of samples in which a marker position is selected as a qtl  was  <dig>  %; nearly half of these samples  were at  <dig>  cm. for a slightly larger region between  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, the %hit was  <dig>  %. for the region between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm of chromosome ix, the %hit was  <dig>  %. the hits on the other chromosomes were more dispersed . from the simulation study, it became clear, however, that the more trees are used in the study, the more precise the qtl analysis becomes, smaller qtl effects can detected, but also the positions of the qtl with small effects are not very accurate.

identification of associations between the parental haplotypes and wbd resistance
the parental haplotypes of the markers that were associated with the qtl are presented in table  <dig>  an analysis of the parental haplotype-phenotype associations based on the number of resistant/susceptible trees  for single qtl showed that the qtl <dig> _t <dig> haplotype  had the highest association of all qtls with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> . of the  <dig> resistant trees in the mapping population of  <dig> trees,  <dig> trees  possessed the t <dig> haplotype at this marker; however,  <dig> trees that carry the favorable t <dig> haplotype were susceptible to wbd . for the haplotype combinations in the offspring , the highest associations were found for qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig>  . the frequency distributions of resistant and susceptible trees for each haplotype and the parental haplotype combinations for qtl <dig> , presented in fig.  <dig>  show that approximately 82 % of the trees with the t <dig> haplotype for this marker were resistant to wbd. when considering the different parental allele combinations, qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> showed the highest association but was only slightly higher than qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> with approximately  <dig> and 80 % resistant trees, respectively.table  <dig> alleles for each of the parental haplotypes  of ‘tsh 1188’ and ‘ccn 51’ for each qtl and representative snp marker associated with wbd

fig.  <dig> distribution of resistant and susceptible trees. the distribution of resistant and susceptible trees is given for  each parental haplotype for qtl <dig> , and  each parental haplotype combination for qtl <dig> . the x-axis represents the different haplotypes and haplotype combinations, respectively, whereas the y-axis represents a stacked column representing the proportion of resistant vs. susceptible trees . from  it is clear that the t <dig> haplotype has more resistant trees  than the other three haplotypes. from  considering the parental haplotype combinations, the combination t2-c <dig> has most of the resistant trees , followed by t2-c <dig> . the numbers in the boxes indicate the number of trees in each class, and the p-values show whether they are significantly different from each other



to identify the best marker combinations of two qtl for the selection of resistant trees, each haplotype combination of qtl <dig>  was combined with each haplotype combination for the other qtl. all the associated p-values are presented in additional file  <dig>  but the five highest associations for a combination of two qtl are presented in table  <dig>  the highest association was found for qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> with qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> , followed by qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> with qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> .

to identify the best marker combinations of three qtl for the selection of resistant trees, two haplotype combinations of qtl <dig>   were combined with the more-significant haplotype combinations for two other qtl. all of the associated p-values are presented in additional file  <dig>  but the five highest associations for a combination of three qtl are presented in table  <dig>  the highest association was found for the combination of qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> with qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> and qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> , followed by the combination of qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> with qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> and qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> . the percentage of resistant trees for the top five of each qtl combination varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % depending on the number of trees that were available with that specific combination .

furthermore, we used the trees that showed a recombination event between the different haplotypes within a small region around the most significant marker and extended this region by adding flanking snp markers. this extension was designed to help us to localize more precisely the most likely candidate genes, but we only managed to do this successfully for the most significant qtl <dig>  on chromosome ix . between the markers tcm009s <dig> and tcm009s <dig>  we identified three trees  with a recombination event between the maternal haplotypes. between tcm009s <dig> and the most significant marker tcm009s <dig>  we identified a single tree  with a recombination event between the maternal haplotypes. one recombination event  was observed between tcm009s <dig> and tcm009s <dig>  furthermore, we identified two recombination events  between the markers tcm009s <dig> and tcm009s <dig> . based on the recombinants, the size of qtl <dig>  between the first and the last snp marker is  <dig>  bp and contains five candidate genes possibly involved in disease resistance .

for the most significant marker  and its neighbor , all of the trees that have the t <dig> haplotype, i.e., the g allele or the t allele, respectively, had ten or fewer total vb over the 4 years and can be considered resistant . the resistant trees that carry the a allele  possess one or more associated alleles of the other identified qtl . the susceptible trees , with the exception of mp01- <dig>  do not possess any of the associated alleles of the other identified qtl. mp01- <dig> contains the favorable alleles of qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig>  qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig> and qtl <dig> _t2-c <dig>  sixty-four trees with a single recombination event were identified in a larger interval from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> ,548 bp. of the  <dig> susceptible trees within this interval, only mp01- <dig> has the g allele, i.e., only 6 % of the trees carrying the g allele are at risk of being misidentified as being resistant based on the allele information .

this result also indicates that these allele-specific markers, either by themselves or in combination with some of the other allele-specific markers of the other qtl, can be used for the diagnostic disease resistance screening of other populations and germplasm collections. the associated snp markers can also be relatively easily converted into pcr-based markers using the dcaps method  <cit> .

sixty-two markers in the wbd qtl <dig> , spanning approximately 500 kb, were used for the phasing, which permitted the generation of haplotype sequences and the identification of the alleles that were associated with wbd. the second haplotype of ‘tsh 1188’, corresponding to the g allele and conferring resistance to wbd, grouped with ‘sca 6 h1’ . this result is not surprising because ‘sca 6’ is one of the great grandparents of ‘tsh 1188’, together with ‘imc 67’ , and is a major source of wbd resistance  <cit> . this haplotype also groups with ‘tsh 516 h2’, which is the result of another cross of ‘sca 6’ with ‘ics 1’, the latter being susceptible to wbd  <cit> . the first haplotype of ‘tsh 1188’, corresponding to the a allele, grouped closely with the first haplotype of ‘ccn 51’ and with both haplotypes of ‘am 1/57’. the second haplotype of ‘ccn 51’ grouped with ‘tsh 516’ h <dig> and both of the matina 1– <dig> haplotypes .fig.  <dig> neighbor joining tree identifies the origin of the main qtl <dig>  to ‘sca 6’. sixty-two markers in the qtl <dig> , spanning about 500 kb, were used for the phasing, which permitted generation of haplotype sequences and, consequently, identification of the alleles associated with wbd in the qtl <dig> 



potential candidate genes possibly involved in witches’ broom resistance through programmed cell death
all of the genes within an interval of 2–3 cm  surrounding the most significant marker for each qtl were investigated. the number of genes within each qtl ranged from  <dig> in qtl <dig>  to  <dig> in qtl <dig> , and the number of candidate genes that were potentially involved in disease resistance ranged from  <dig> in qtl <dig>  to  <dig> in qtl <dig>  . the potential biological processes for each of the genes were determined by go slim annotation .

one of the first steps in the recognition of pathogens is the activation of plant nucleotide-binding -leucine-rich repeat  receptors by direct or indirect mechanisms  <cit> . on qtl <dig> , three putative disease resistance-related proteins were identified that contain the nb and lrr domains. thecc1eg <dig> and thecc1eg <dig> encode a cc-nbs-lrr resistance protein, whereas thecc1eg <dig> encodes an nb-arc domain-containing disease resistance protein. a fourth gene, thecc1eg <dig> encodes a disease resistance-responsive family protein. the snp tcm006s <dig>  which is associated with qtl <dig> , is located within thecc1eg <dig>  a gene encoding a hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family protein . cross-linking of hrgps is an important process by which to strengthen the cell walls, contributing to plant defense reactions  <cit> . another gene, thecc1eg <dig>  in qtl <dig>  is the leaf senescence-associated receptor-like protein kinase, which has homology to the senescence-induced receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinase . this gene is specifically expressed in the leaves at senescence and after pathogen infection and is a putative target of wrky <dig>  <cit> , which is a transcription factor that is activated through the mapk pathway  <cit> . on qtl <dig> , the most associated snp, tcm006s <dig>  is within thecc1eg <dig>  a myb-like  <dig> gene that does not seem to function in disease resistance.

the next stages of the plant immune response include a rapid influx of calcium ions, an oxidative burst of ros and the activation of mapks . four genes that were identified in qtl <dig>  have been annotated as 2-oxoglutarate and fe-dependent oxygenase superfamily proteins , which are involved in the formation of hydrogen peroxide at different stages in cacao depending on the disease status of the trees   <cit> . on qtl <dig> , the most associated snp, tcm007s <dig>  is within thecc1eg <dig>  a nucleotide/sugar transporter protein, which does not seem to function in disease resistance. another neighboring gene, thecc1eg <dig>  is annotated as an aldolase-type tim barrel family protein, which in arabidopsis thaliana seems to be involved in defense response to bacteria and in the hydrogen peroxide biosynthetic process  <cit> .

the mapk signaling cascade is involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of plant stress hormones, ros generation, stomatal closure, defense gene activation, phytoalexin biosynthesis, cell wall strengthening and programmed cell death   <cit> . in a. thaliana, one of the genes involved in this cascade is mapk kinase  <dig>  which is also one of the genes  that we identified in qtl <dig>   <cit> . another disease resistance-related gene, thecc1eg <dig>  in qtl <dig>  encodes a glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein. in crucifers, these enzymes break down glucosinolates and convert them into biologically active compounds. these compounds restrain insect feeding activity on plants and have potent antimicrobial activity, mainly against necrotrophic fungi  <cit> . ndr <dig> , which is in the same qtl, was shown to be required for disease resistance in a. thaliana to both bacterial and fungal pathogens  <cit> . the snp marker tcm003s <dig>  which is associated with qtl <dig> , is located within thecc1eg <dig>  a gene encoding an rna-binding  family protein.

another important pathway in disease response and pcd is the ubiquitin/26s proteasome-mediated pathway, which is involved in the selective degradation of proteins in cells of eukaryotic organisms . at least five u-box e <dig> ligases have been identified that are involved in disease response to various pathogens in different plants species . for example, disruption of the a. thaliana plant u-box protein  <dig>  by t-dna insertion results in spontaneous cell death, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and sa, and elevated resistance to biotrophic pathogens, as well as increased susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . tcm009s <dig>  the snp in qtl <dig>  with the best association with wbd, is located into thecc1eg <dig> that has been annotated as a ring/u-box superfamily protein. another ring/u-box superfamily protein  has been identified within the same qtl. three other potential candidate genes in this qtl have been annotated as follows: dna-binding protein phosphatase  <dig> , uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats , and serine/threonine protein kinase ctr1/edr <dig> with an octicosapeptide/phox/bem1p domain . in humans, uaca is involved in a series of molecular signals in which an intracellular signal is conveyed to trigger apoptotic cell death  <cit> . this pathway is induced by the detection of dna damage, which can be caused by ros, thereby linking to one of the primary symptoms of wbd. ctr <dig> is a raf-like mapkkk that is involved in et signal transduction  <cit> , and edr <dig> was found to encode a mapkkk that is similar to ctr <dig>  this mapkkk is involved in the induction of several defense responses, including host cell death, and it negatively regulates sa-dependent defense responses, abscisic acid  signaling, and et-induced senescence  <cit> . tcm009s <dig>  the snp in qtl <dig>  with the best association with wbd, is located within thecc1eg <dig> that has been annotated as encoding an rna recognition motif -containing protein. it is interesting that, according to string v <dig>   <cit> , this protein in a. thaliana may interact with a tir-nbs-lrr class disease resistance protein. among the other candidate genes, two were annotated as burp domain-containing proteins. these proteins are involved in abiotic and biotic stresses in brassica  <cit> .

ca2+ and mapks also control the synthesis and/or signaling of the hormones that are involved in the later steps of defense gene activation and pcd. the snp marker tcm004s <dig> that is associated with qtl <dig>  is located within thecc1eg <dig> encoding a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  <dig>  overexpression of this enzyme in poplar showed extremely high quantities of the glycoside of salicylic acid . sa accumulation, and therefore sag, could catalyze the increase in other plant defense metabolites  <cit> . also in qtl <dig>  thecc1eg <dig>  the senescence-associated gene  <dig>  is part of the enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>  pathway and is responsible for sa accumulation after infection with biotrophic pathogens of a. thaliana  <cit> .

of the  <dig> candidate genes selected for differential gene expression , only six showed considerable expression differences between infected and mock-infected plants for both ‘ccn 51’ and ‘tsh 1188’. the most remarkable expression differences were seen for the uaca gene. when comparing the infected ‘ccn 51’ plants, it was clear that this gene was approximately 4-fold upregulated at  <dig> and 12 h after infection , whereas it had a basal level of expression at the other time points. in the resistant ‘tsh 1188’, this gene was approximately 8-fold downregulated at  <dig> hai, whereas it had a similar expression profile for the other time points . according to the study of sena et al.  <cit>  this early response may correspond with the early infection stage of the fungus, where the basidiospores start to germinate around  <dig> hai in the susceptible ‘catongo’, and around  <dig> hai in the resistant ‘tsh 1188’, but both reach their maximum at  <dig> hai. penetration into the plant tissues was observed at  <dig> hai for both susceptible and resistant genotypes, and in susceptible genotypes, primary hyphae were observed in the cortex under the epidermis at  <dig> hai  <cit> .

a study performed by teixeira et al.  <cit>  showed a detailed transcriptome analysis of the interaction between m. perniciosa and cacao at 30 days after artificial infection . they identified  <dig>  upregulated and  <dig> downregulated differentially expressed genes in cacao. of those differentially expressed genes  <dig> were located within our identified qtl. three of those genes were pathogen-related  or receptor-like kinases involved in signal transduction . the later one showed a positive fold change of  <dig>  compared to the untreated control. this gene is also located between our best snp marker on qtl <dig>   and the closest neighboring snp . three other genes, cgd <dig> in qtl <dig> , cdg <dig> and cdg <dig> in qtl <dig> , are involved in photosynthetic, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, more specifically in sugar transport, beta-oxidation of fatty acids and amino acid metabolism, respectively  <cit> . it is interesting that many of these identified genes are actually very close to the most significant snps in each qtl identified in our study . it would be of interest as well to investigate all these genes identified by teixeira et al.  <cit>  during the very early stages of infection.

CONCLUSIONS
one of the main requirements of an efficient mas program in cacao is to have reliable markers associated with the trait of interest. these markers and ultimate knowledge of the underlying genes must be identified first. this knowledge demands a combination of large mapping populations with very distinct parents that segregate for the trait of interest, a dense set of mapped markers, and rigorous phenotyping capabilities. the availability of a sequenced genome helps in the identification and annotation of potential candidate genes, although it is important to mention here that annotations are based on the matina 1– <dig> genome, which is susceptible to wbd. it is therefore not unlikely that one or more genes responsible for the resistance phenotype occur specifically in the resistant cultivars, which might render the use of the matina 1– <dig> genome inappropriate. we combined these requirements to identify several genomic regions that are associated with wbd resistance, and a novel source of resistance that most likely comes from the ‘ccn 51’ parent. thanks to the large population size of the mp <dig> population, we were able to pick up qtl and markers with relatively small effects that can contribute to the creation and selection of more tolerant/resistant plant material.
