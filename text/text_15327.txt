BACKGROUND
cytokinins  are a class of plant hormones that have significant roles in various aspects of plant growth and development, including apical dominance, shoot or root branching, leaf expansion, lateral bud growth, photosynthesis, seed germination, floral transition, and leaf senescence  <cit> . moreover, these hormones participate in biomass distribution  <cit>  and the response to environmental stimuli  <cit> . cks signals are sensed and transduced by the two-component signal  system; the availability of cks in suitable concentrations in the right place and at the right time is necessary for their interaction with a specific receptor. the fine-tuning of hormone levels in individual tissues, cells, and organelles must be properly maintained by the biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes  <cit> . cks synthesis in plants is catalyzed by a family of isopentenyl transferases  via the methylerythritol phosphate  and mevalonate  pathways  <cit> . further studies reveal that atp/adp ipts control the biosynthesis of isopentenyladenine - and trans-zeatin -type cks, whereas trna ipts are responsible for the synthesis of cis-zeatin -type cks  <cit> . the irreversible degradation of cks and their derivatives is catalyzed by ck oxidase/dehydrogenases , which are encoded by a small gene family. the substrate specificities of ipts have been proven to vary, depending on the origin and species  <cit> . similarly, ckx enzymes have their own substrate specificity, with various spatial and temporal expression patterns  <cit> .

the ipt and ckx gene families in various plants have been identified and cloned, including those in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , oryza sativa <cit> , zea mays <cit> , glycine max <cit> , solanum lycopersicum <cit> , triticum aestivum <cit> , hordeum vulgare <cit> , sorghum bicolor <cit> , and populus trichocarpa <cit> , among others. a putative atp/gtp binding site  exists in all of the deduced protein sequences of ipt, whereas ckx protein sequences have fad- and ck-binding domains. the functions of ipt and ckx genes have likewise been extensively studied. the overexpression of atipt <dig> caused ck-independent shoot formation on calli  <cit> . the overexpression of zmipt <dig> in arabidopsis produced transgenic plants with phenotypes indicative of cks overproduction  <cit> . transgenic tobacco with 35s-gmipt <dig> similarly had the typical phenotypes of cks overproduction  <cit> . the enhanced expression of an ipt gene designated as sho showed ck-specific effects, including enhanced shooting and reduced apical dominance, as well as delayed senescence and flowering  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the ckx3/ckx <dig> double mutant had higher cks content, which caused the mutants to have more flower primordia, larger flowers, more siliques, and more seeds; the total seed yield of these mutants increased by 55%, as compared with the wild-type  <cit> . ashikari et al.  <cit>  conclusively showed that the reduced expression of gn1a, a gene for osckx <dig>  caused cks accumulation in rice inflorescence meristems and increased the number of reproductive organs, thereby enhancing the grain yield by 21%. rnai was more recently used in barley to silence hvckx <dig>  which increased both the grain number and grain weight  <cit> . the potential use of ck-related genes in seed size and seed mass determination will become an active field of study in the future. meanwhile, increasing evidence suggests that cks are involved in stress response  <cit> . nishiyama et al.  <cit>  proposed a model for the roles of bioactive cks and antagonistic aba under different stresses. all ck-deficient plants with reduced levels of different cks exhibited strong stress-tolerant phenotypes; the majority of atipt and atckx genes were repressed by stress and aba treatments. the ipt and ckx genes in maize and soybean similarly responded to drought and salt conditions  <cit> . given that water deficit and high-salinity stresses have become limiting factors for crop and vegetable production and quality, these studies may provide new insights into breeding stress-resistant plants.

brassica rapa is one of the most economically important vegetable crops worldwide. the whole genome sequencing of b. rapa , by the brassica rapa genome sequencing project consortium , enables us to undertake the genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the gene families related to the morphological diversity and agronomic traits of brassica crops  <cit> . furthermore, b. rapa serves as a crucial reference for understanding polyploidy-related crop genome evolution because of its agronomic importance and phylogenetic relationships  <cit> .

ando et al.  <cit>  isolated cdna fragments of five putative cytokinin synthase genes from b. rapa  and examined their expression levels using northern blot analysis. o’keefe et al.  <cit>  identified bript <dig>  - <dig>  and − <dig> as well as brckx <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and − <dig> in rapid-cycling brassica; their expression levels during pod and seed development were examined. however, brassicaceae genomes have undergone three rounds of whole genome duplication ; these genomes are referred to as 1r, 2r, and 3r, which are equivalent to the γ, β, and α duplication events, and brassica genomes have undergone another whole genome triplication  after speciation from arabidopsis thaliana at approximately 17– <dig> mya   <cit> , leading to significantly increased duplicated gene numbers in b. rapa. a total of  <dig>  protein-coding genes were identified in the b. rapa genome, which were roughly  <dig>  times as many genes as those found in a. thaliana   <cit> . accordingly, we hypothesized that the number of bript and brckx genes would be greater than that of their arabidopsis counterparts. the main objectives of our study were to identify all the ipt and ckx genes in b. rapa, to analyze the physiological and biochemical properties of their encoded proteins, to explore their gene expression patterns, to discover the mechanisms of their responses to abiotic stresses and exogenous plant hormones, and to identify several potential genes for breeding to increase plant production, quality, and stress-resistance. furthermore, we intended to gain genome-level insights into the divergence, variation, and evolution of the bript and brckx gene families.

the bript genes were distributed on  <dig> out of  <dig> chromosomes , belonging to the three sub-genomes . the orf lengths of the bript genes ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, which encoded polypeptides of  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa with predicted molecular weights ranging from  <dig>  kd to  <dig>  kd. the theoretical pi ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the bript genes were all predicted to be localized in the chloroplasts. similarly, the brckx genes were also distributed on  <dig> out of  <dig> chromosomes . the orf lengths of the brckx genes were longer than those of the bript genes; these orfs ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and encoded polypeptides of  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa with predicted molecular weights ranging from  <dig>  kd to  <dig>  kd. the theoretical pi ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the predicted subcellular localization of the brckx genes varied and included the chloroplast, mitochondria, and secretory pathways. protein glycosylation contributes to regulation of enzymatic activity, translocation, and protein stability; thereby, adding an additional and important level of complexity to ckx regulation  <cit> . similar to the zmckx genes, the brckx genes possessed  <dig> to  <dig> predicted glycosylation sites.

gene structure and conserved domain analysis of bript and brckx genes
to analyze the structural characteristics and conserved regions of the bript and brckx gene families, their gene structures with exons and introns were mapped, their conserved regions and motifs were examined, and their putative protein sequences were aligned. similar to the ipt gene families in other plants, bript genes could be grouped into two types of ipt genes: plant adenylate ipt- or adp/atp-dependent genes  and plant trna ipt- or trna-dependent genes . plant trna ipt genes could be further divided into plant trna ipt genes of eukaryotic  and prokaryotic  origin. seven plant adenylate bript genes were notably composed of a single exon without introns and three plant adenylate bript genes only had one intron. by contrast, the longer plant trna bript genes had at least ten exons and nine introns, which was consistent with the more complicated trna ipt gene structures in other plants . the multiple alignment of atipt protein sequences showed that atipt <dig> contained two inserted regions of approximately 20– <dig> amino acids in length; while the carboxyl-terminal region of the said protein sequences had an extra  <dig> amino acids. a similar structure was observed in bript <dig>  atipt <dig> and bript <dig> had five shorter discontinuous inserted regions of approximately 8– <dig> amino acids instead of the two larger regions in atipt <dig> and bript <dig>  however, the carboxyl-terminal region with an extra  <dig> amino acids was conserved in both bript <dig> and bript <dig> . two types of ipt gene structures are closely related and had also unique conserved motifs. seven conserved motifs were found for the bript protein sequences . all bript protein sequences contained one or two conserved regions that belonged to the p-loop ntpase superfamily . furthermore, three plant trna bript protein sequences contained either plno <dig> or plno <dig> multi-domains, which were unique to trna ipts. the multiple alignment of bript protein sequences with atipt protein sequences likewise revealed two corresponding conserved regions, which were designated as region a and region b. region a was found in all the bript protein sequences; it was identified as a putative atp/gtp-binding site  motif, with a core sequence of tgxgks . region b was only present in three plant trna bript protein sequences; this region was classified as a trna binding site. the two types of plant trna bript proteins had different consensus sequences, which were denoted by a red box in additional file  <dig> 

the gene structures of the brckx genes were more diverse and contained several exons and introns . a fad-binding domain and a ck-binding domain were generally indispensable in a functional ckx gene; these domains belonged to the fad-binding  and ck-binding  superfamilies, respectively. the unique brckx1- <dig> gene had a longer sequence length and more complex conserved domains . based on the alignment and conserved domains analysis, the multi-domain brckx1- <dig> was composed of two regions, region  <dig> and region  <dig>  region  <dig> contained the typical conserved domains of the ckx gene family, namely, the fad- and ck-binding domains. by contrast, region  <dig> had the characteristics of a tpr protein and contained a tpr repeat and a dnaj domain. however, the atckx <dig>  and attpr <dig>  genes in arabidopsis are two completely different functional genes, even though these genes are located next to each other. based on the gene structures analysis, as compared with that of a. thaliana, we proposed that brckx1- <dig> was formed by the fusion of the ckx and tpr genes. however, the actual mechanism of brckx1- <dig> formation is still unknown. ten conserved motifs were found in the brckx genes . the sequence alignment showed that the fad-binding domain was well conserved in the n-terminal halves of all known ckx sequences . moreover, the ghs motif  was perfectly conserved in this family protein sequences. we also identified several additional conserved motifs, including the vphpwlnl motif  at position  <dig> and a pgqxif signature  at the c-terminal end of the ckx protein sequences. these motifs appeared to be specific to ckx enzymes.

chromosomal mapping and duplications of bript and brckx genes
we mapped bript and brckx genes on chromosomes . brckx2- <dig> was not mapped due to its location on scaffold <dig>  even genes with high similarity were not located on the same chromosome. segmental and tandem duplications are important sources of gene duplication. gu et al.  <cit>  proposed that the ckx gene expansion occurred mainly through segmental duplications in maize, rice, and poplar. in this study, no tandem duplicated gene pairs were found. however, segmental duplicates existed in both bript and brckx gene families . five pairs of segmental duplicates were found in  <dig> bript genes: bript1- <dig>  and bript1- <dig> ; bript5- <dig>  and bript5- <dig> ; bript7- <dig>  and bript7- <dig> ; bript8- <dig>  and bript8- <dig> ; and bript9- <dig>  and bript9- <dig> . three pairs of segmental duplicates were found in  <dig> brckx genes: brckx1- <dig> , brckx1- <dig>  and brckx1- <dig> ; brckx3- <dig>  and brckx3- <dig> ; and brckx7- <dig>  and brckx7- <dig> . each pair of segmental duplicates was distributed on different chromosomes. bript3- <dig> and bript3- <dig> were notably not considered as a pair of segmental duplicates, even though they shared high sequence similarity.

phylogenetic relationships of the bript and brckx gene families
to identify subgroups and reveal the evolutionary relationships of the two gene families, the phylogenetic analyses of the bript and atipt genes, as well as that of the brckx and atckx genes, were performed with the putative protein sequences using mega  software. as shown in figure 4a, the bripts and atipts were clustered into four subgroups: group i , group ii , group iii , and group iv . group i and group iii included the majority of the bript genes, which belonged to the plant adenylate ipt genes. the trna-dependent bript genes and adp/atp-dependent bript genes were highly diverse; these genes could be divided into two different subgroups. bript <dig> in group ii, the atipt <dig> homolog, is a plant trna ipt gene of eukaryotic origin. bript9- <dig>  bript9- <dig>  and atipt <dig> all shared the properties of plant trna ipt genes with prokaryotic origins, and were classified into group iv. similarly, the brckx and atckx genes were also clustered into four subgroups: group i , group ii , group iii , and group iv  . further phylogenetic reconstructions using ipt and ckx protein sequences from various species, including dicotyledons, monocotyledons, moss, algae, and bacteria, were performed to confirm the ipt and ckx genes subgroups, as well as to investigate the evolution of bript and brckx genes. the corresponding plant ipt genes were divided into four groups: groups i, ii, iii, and iv . as shown in the figure, genes in dicotyledons and monocotyledons were randomly dispersed among the four groups. this phenomenon suggested that ipt genes originated from both dicotyledons and monocotyledons or were not lost after the divergence of the two plant groups. furthermore, only the six ipt genes in the bryophyte p. patens  were found in group iv, which also included the plant trna ipt genes of prokaryotic origin, implying that ppipt genes possiblely originated from the trna ipt genes. plant ckx genes were classified into five groups, with group v as an additional group . group v contained only the six ppckx genes.

evolutionary patterns and divergence of ipt and ckx genes in the cruciferae family
to elucidate the evolutionary patterns and divergence of ipt and ckx genes in cruciferae family, the three sequenced cruciferous species  were chosen to make a genome-level comparison. the genome size of the north american a. lyrata is  <dig> mb, with eight chromosomes  <cit> . a. thaliana, with its  <dig> mb genome and five chromosomes, has undergone a ~30% reduction in genome size  <cit>  and nine to ten chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . a. thaliana was estimated to have diverged from a. lyrata approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . b. rapa has approximately  <dig> mb and ten chromosomes; this species is believed to have emerged from the brassica progenitor approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, 6b, the ipt and ckx genes were well dispersed on the chromosomes, except for the sca <dig> chromosome in a. lyrata as well as a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> in b. rapa. the corresponding relationships of the ipt and ckx genes on chromosomes were clearly evident: sca <dig> corresponded to chr1; sca <dig> and sca <dig> corresponded to chr2; sca <dig> and sca <dig> corresponded to chr3; sca <dig> corresponded to chr4; sca <dig> and sca <dig> corresponded to chr <dig>  this trend was consistent with a previous comparison of the a. lyrata and a. thaliana genomes  <cit> . traces of chromosomal rearrangement and simplification in the a. thaliana genome were easily captured by the analysis. the corresponding relationships between b. rapa and a. thaliana were still regular, although relatively more complicated. homologous genes were separately existed on chr <dig> as paired with a <dig> and a <dig>  chr <dig> as paired with a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  chr <dig> as paired with a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  chr <dig> as paired with a <dig>  and chr <dig> as paired with a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  this trend was consistent with the segmental collinearity of the b. rapa and a. thaliana genomes  <cit> .

to reveal the divergence of ipt and ckx genes in the cruciferae family, the ks and ka modes for the paralogs and orthologs in the three genomes were compared . evidently, the ks values of the paralogs in b. rapa were much smaller than the values of the orthologous genes between b. rapa, a. thaliana, and a. lyrata. the ks values obtained from comparisons of the sets of putative orthologs were used to calculate the divergence time between b. rapa and a. thaliana. the ks values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with a concentrated location between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the calculation of divergence time was based on the neutral substitution rate of  <dig> ×10- <dig> substitutions per site per year for chs <cit> . our results showed b. rapa diverged from a. thaliana at around 26– <dig> mya, which coincided well with previous studies of speciation between the brassica and arabidopsis genomes  <cit> .

tissue or organ-specific expression of bript and brckx genes
tissue-specific and developmental stage-related expression data are useful in the identification of genes that are involved in defining the precise nature of individual tissues in a given developmental stage  <cit> . cks have central regulatory functions during plant development and have essential functions during the adaptation to adverse environments. a clear expression profile of the genes of interest is an indispensable step to find and utilize agriculturally important genes. the homeostasis of the ck level in various tissues and organs is mainly regulated by the ipt and ckx enzymes. thus, to obtain an initial picture of the functions of bript and brckx genes during the vegetative and reproductive development, the transcript levels of these genes in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, immature siliques, sepals, petals, stamens, pistils, little buds, medium-sized buds, and big buds were analyzed by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure 8a, the trna ipt genes, bript <dig>  bript9- <dig>  and bript9- <dig>  were ubiquitously expressed, which was similar to the expression patterns of atipt <dig> and atipt <dig> <cit> . other bript genes demonstrated tissue or organ-specific expression levels. the expression of the bript genes was similar to that of the atipt genes. bript1- <dig> and bript1- <dig> were highly expressed in the little and medium-sized buds, but reached very low levels in the big buds. bript3- <dig> and bript3- <dig> were highly expressed in the roots, and bript3- <dig> was also expressed with very high levels in the leaves. bript5- <dig> and bript5- <dig> were mainly expressed in the roots. bript7- <dig> and bript7- <dig> were primarily transcribed in the stamens and roots. these segmental duplicated genes had uniform expression levels. bript8- <dig> and bript8- <dig> had unique expression patterns. bript8- <dig> had the highest expression levels in siliques, whereas bript8- <dig> was mainly expressed in stamens. the bript genes were expressed abundantly in the reproductive organs. maybe the roots alone could not supply sufficient cks for the increasing demand in the reproductive organs. as can be seen from figure 8b, the expression of brckx genes was more diverse, only brckx7- <dig> and brckx7- <dig> were uniformly expressed at high levels in sepals and petals. brckx1- <dig> was mainly expressed in the roots; brckx1- <dig> maintained a high level in the stamens, flowers, and petals. brckx1- <dig> seemed to be ubiquitously expressed, with relatively higher levels in the petals and pistils. brckx2- <dig> and brckx2- <dig> were mainly expressed in the reproductive organs, including the flowers, sepals, petals, and stamens. however, the expression of both genes was barely detected in vegetative organs. brckx3- <dig> was highly expressed in the petals, stamens, and flowers whereas brckx3- <dig> was mainly expressed in the floral buds. brckx <dig> and brckx <dig> had extremely high levels in the roots and stamens, respectively. brckx <dig> mostly transcribed in the roots, leaves, and sepals. the segmental duplicated pairs of bript genes had similar expression profiles. however, this was the case in only one of the four segmental duplicated pairs of brckx genes. cks could be rapidly and precisely transported from the synthetic positions to the functional parts via a multiple of putative purine permeases   <cit>  and equilibrative nucleotide transporters   <cit>  involved in cks transport in plants. thus, ckx enzymes are compulsory to be present in various organs to maintain the finely-tuned homeostasis of cks levels. although the segmental duplicated gene pairs originated from common ancestral genes after the wgt, they may have probably evolved into independent new genes with irreplaceable functions.

stress-inducible cis-regulatory elements in the promoter regions of bript and brckx genes
the cis-regulatory elements, which are located in the upstream regions of genes, act as the binding sites for tfs; thus, these sequences have essential roles in determining the tissue-specific or stress-responsive expression patterns of genes  <cit> . increasing evidence has showed that genes responsive to multiple stimuli are closely correlated with cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions  <cit> . to further understand transcriptional regulation and the potential functions of the bript and brckx genes, putative promoter regions in the  <dig> bp sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site were used to identify putative stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements. several abiotic stress elements were found . one salt-stress , one heat-stress , one cold-stress , one wound-stress , and three drought-stress  cis-elements were common in the promoter regions of the bript and brckx genes. therefore, b. rapa may adapt to stressful environments by changing its cks content. particularly, bript3- <dig>  bript3- <dig>  and brckx3- <dig> had up to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cold-stress elements , respectively. the number of drought-stress elements  in brckx <dig> reached  <dig>  the other remaining genes likewise possessed abundant stress-inducible cis-regulatory elements. the trna ipt genes in arabidopsis were notably unaffected by the mineral nutrients, auxin, and ck concentrations  <cit> . by contrast, three trna ipt genes in b. rapa, bript <dig>  bript9- <dig>  and bript9- <dig> were also rich in the five types of cis-regulatory elements based on our results. therefore, we hypothesized that the trna ipt genes might also have important functions in the adaptation to adverse environmental stimuli. moreover,  <dig>  and  <dig>  abiotic stress-inducible cis-elements per promoter were found in the gmipt and gmckx genes, respectively  <cit> . similarly, brckx genes had relatively more stress-responsive elements than bript genes.

expression profiles of bript and brckx genes under drought and salt stress
previous studies revealed that the cks content was correlated with stress-resistance; changed transcripts of ipt and ckx genes were observed in plants when they were exposed to drought and high salinity conditions, including arabidopsis <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize,  <cit>  and soybeans  <cit> . theoretically, the bript and brckx genes could also respond to various abiotic stresses because of the presence of stress-inducible cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions. qrt-pcr was used to analyse the expression profiles of bript and brckx genes under drought and salt stress conditions. the data were presented with clusters using fold-change values transformed to log <dig> format. as shown in figure  <dig>  in drought conditions, the majority of the bript and brckx genes were initially induced and upregulated before falling to basal levels during the time-course, despite the continuous application of the stressor. to be more specific, bript7- <dig> and brckx3- <dig> were continuously induced and maintained at high levels in conditions of serious drought. bript7- <dig> even showed remarkably more than a 40-fold increase in its expression levels. three ckx genes, brckx1- <dig>  brckx1- <dig>  and brckx <dig> maintained their relatively high expressions throughout the experiment. notably, in level iii, genes such as bript <dig>  -3- <dig>  -5- <dig>  -9- <dig> and −9- <dig>  as well as brckx <dig> and −7- <dig>  eventually returned to the basal level, expressions of bript8- <dig>  brckx1- <dig> and brckx7- <dig> dropped below the basal level, transcripts of bript3- <dig> and brckx2- <dig> were even hardly detectable. by contrast, salt treatment induced variable expression patterns. still, the majority of bript and brckx genes were primarily induced and upregulated. however, their transcripts fell with prolonged treatment time. the transcription of bript9- <dig> seemed to be unaffected. only bript5- <dig> was continuously induced with a 7-fold increase in its expression levels, whereas brckx1- <dig> was suppressed and its expression levels dropped throughout the experiment. bript7- <dig> and −9- <dig>  as well as brckx <dig>  - <dig> and −7- <dig>  had relatively high levels after  <dig> h of salt treatment while several genes returned to the basal level, namely, brckx1- <dig>  -3- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and −7- <dig>  moreover, transcripts of bript <dig>  brckx1- <dig>  brckx3- <dig>  bript3- <dig>  bript8- <dig>  and brckx2- <dig> dropped below the basal level and were eventually undetectable at this time point. except for a similar response to drought and salt treatments for both bript and brckx genes, we noted that the transcripts of both bript3- <dig> and brckx2- <dig> had almost disappeared with treatment time going on. consistent with the results in maize  <cit> , the trna ipt genes in brassica responded to stressful environments as well.

effects of exogenous 6-ba and aba on the expressions of bript and brckx genes
various phytohormones regulate the abiotic and biotic stress resistance. cks and aba are two important plant hormones involved in stress response. cks and aba have been postulated to exert antagonistic activities during the adaptation to environmental stress in plants  <cit> . to determine the effects of exogenous cks and aba on the expressions of bript and brckx genes, we investigated the expression profiles of these genes using qrt-pcr analyses and data were also presented with clusters using fold-change values transformed to log <dig> format. viewing from figure  <dig>  five adenylate ipt genes in b. rapa were significantly repressed at  <dig>  or  <dig> h, except for the unaffected bript5- <dig>  by contrast, the transcripts of bript9- <dig> was relatively steady, but bript <dig> and bript9- <dig> were also moderately induced by 6-ba. we hypothesized that this phenomenon could be attributed to the dynamic balance of various cks in b. rapa. 6-ba is an ip type ck, and exogenous 6-ba application repressed the transcriptions of adenylate ipt genes, whereas the trna ipt genes were upregulated by a feedback regulation. a remarkable increase was observed in the levels of brckx3- <dig> and brckx <dig> transcripts after 6-ba treatment. nevertheless, the expression levels of brckx1- <dig>  -1- <dig>  -1- <dig>  -2- <dig> and − <dig> were decreased by various degrees. for the aba treatment, five adenylate ipt genes in b. rapa were significantly repressed at  <dig>  or  <dig> h, except for bript5- <dig>  nevertheless, the expression of bript9- <dig> was relatively steady, whereas bript <dig> and bript9- <dig> was moderately induced by aba, which was similar to the response patterns to 6-ba. the expressions of most of the brckx genes were down-regulated. however, the relative transcription levels of brckx3- <dig>  brckx3- <dig>  and brckx <dig> were upregulated at  <dig>  or  <dig> h. the antagonisms between cks and aba in plants may account for this phenomenon, but this mechanism has yet to be explored.

discussion
the expansion and loss of bript and brckx genes following hexaploidy formation by wgt
brassicaceae genomes have undergone three rounds of whole genome duplication  and brassica genomes have undergone another whole genome triplication  after speciation from arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . b. rapa is believed to have emerged from the brassica progenitor approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . considering wgt of the brassica genomes, the ipt and ckx genes should have approximately three times as many members as that of arabidopsis. however, we could only identify  <dig> ipt genes and  <dig> ckx genes in b. rapa, thereby suggesting a substantial loss of genes following hexaploidy formation by wgt. gene loss was likewise observed for the crf and pg gene families in b. rapa . consistent with previous studies, the triplicated b. rapa genome contained only approximately twice the number of genes in arabidopsis because of genome shrinkage  <cit> . previous studies showed that atipt <dig> is non-functional in the wassilewskija  ecotype because of a frame-shift mutation  <cit> , but is a functional gene in the columbia  ecotype  <cit> . by contrast, atipt <dig> is a functional gene in all ecotypes  <cit> . excluding a possible pseudogene, atipt <dig>  the genomes of a. lyrata, and a. thaliana had equal numbers of ipt and ckx genes, thereby reflecting their relatively stable genome evolution because of a short separation time. however, both homologous genes of atipt <dig> and atipt <dig> in b. rapa were not found. ando et al.  <cit>  and o’keefe et al.  <cit>  identified several bript and brckx genes, but still failed to obtain bript <dig> and bript <dig>  thus, the homologous genes of atipt <dig> and atipt <dig> were probably lost in b. rapa during the long evolutionary history. gene loss was a more common phenomenon in distantly related species. le et al.  <cit>  reported that atipt <dig>  atipt <dig>  atipt <dig>  atipt <dig>  and gmipt <dig> appeared to originate from a common ancestor. these genes expanded and were then retained in arabidopsis but not in soybean after the speciation event. genes with high homology to atipt <dig>  atipt <dig>  atipt <dig>  and atipt <dig> were also not found in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and tomato  <cit> . we did not find homologs for atipt <dig> and atipt <dig> in this study. nevertheless, genes homologous with atipt <dig> and atipt <dig> were identified in b. rapa, namely, bript1- <dig>  bript1- <dig>  bript8- <dig>  and bript8- <dig>  these genes all belonged to group i with close relationships. another piece of supporting evidence was that another ipt gene was found in b. napus, bnipt <dig>  which was homologous to atipt <dig> <cit> . the evolutionary mechanism of ipt genes in various species is still waiting to be clarified.

the ipt and ckx genes have been discovered in the cyanobacteria nostoc and the phytopathogen rhodococcus fascians, respectively, with a large genetic distance from the other ipt and ckx genes. none of the ipt and ckx sequences have been found in green algae  <cit> . schmuelling et al.  <cit>  proposed that the presence of putative ckx sequences in cyanobacteria suggested that plant ckx genes might evolved from ancient chloroplast genes, which probably originated from the endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria. to date, the bryophyte p. patens is the earliest known terrestrial plant with ipt and ckx genes. moreover, previous studies showed that the complete set of proteins in the ck signaling pathway first appeared in the said bryophyte  <cit> . genes involved in the two-component system  of the p. patens were identified and characterized  <cit> . thus, the ck metabolic pathway, and its signal transduction pathway imply that p. patens is the earliest species to have achieved a finely tuned control over ck homeostasis via biosynthesis that diverged to conquer land.

evolutionary patterns of ipt and ckx genes in the cruciferae family
since the tetraploidization of the a. thaliana ancestor 30– <dig> mya, a wave of chromosomal rearrangements has modified its genome architecture. the majority of rearrangements had occurred before the arabidopsis–brassica split at 20– <dig> mya; thus, the segmental architecture of the a. thaliana genome was predominantly conserved in brassica <cit> . we made a genome-level comparison with the three sequenced cruciferous species . by analyzing the corresponding relationships of the ipt and ckx genes on chromosomes, traces of chromosomal rearrangement were easily captured. brassica genomes have undergone whole genome triplication  after speciation from arabidopsis thaliana, leading to significantly increased duplicated genes. duplicated genes occur as the tandem duplicated genes and segmental duplicated genes. for the ipt and ckx genes in b. rapa, no tandem duplicated genes were found, but five pairs of segmental duplicates were found among  <dig> bript genes, and three pairs of segmental duplicates were found among  <dig> brckx genes, suggesting that the expansion of bript and brckx genes after speciation from arabidopsis thaliana is mainly attributed to segmental duplication events during the whole genome triplication . the ka  and ks  is a measure to explore the mechanism of gene divergence after duplication. large-scale duplication events are defined as simultaneous duplications of genes. assuming a molecular clock, the synonymous substitution rates  of these duplicates are expected to be similar over time. there are, however, substantial rate variations among genes  <cit> . we used the relative ks measure as the proxy for time to evaluate the divergence time between b. rapa and arabidopsis. the ks values of the duplicated paralogs in b. rapa were notably much smaller than the values of the duplicated orthologous genes between b. rapa and arabidopsis, further confirming that the duplicated ipt and ckx genes in b. rapa were produced during the whole genome triplication  after speciation from arabidopsis.

changed expression patterns of the duplicated bript and brckx genes
duplication occurs in an individual and may be retained or lost in the population, similar to a point mutation  <cit> . unless the presence of an extra amount of gene product is advantageous, two genes with identical functions are unlikely to be stably maintained in the genome. theoretical population genetics predicates that both duplicates can be stably maintained when they differ in some aspects of their functions  <cit> . sub-functionalization and neo-functionalization are two evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. these may account for the varied expression patterns of paralogs. our study showed bript1- <dig> and 1– <dig>  as well as brckx2- <dig>  -2- <dig>  -3- <dig>  -3- <dig>  - <dig>  -7- <dig> and −7- <dig>  were mainly expressed in the reproductive organs, whereas bript3- <dig>  -3- <dig>  -5- <dig> and −5- <dig>  as well as brckx <dig> and − <dig> had major transcripts in the vegetative organs. even the segmental duplicated gene pairs had inconsistent expression profiles. for instance, brckx1- <dig> was mainly expressed in roots while brckx1- <dig> maintained at high levels in stamens, flowers and petals. meanwhile, brckx1- <dig> was ubiquitously expressed, with relatively high levels in the petals and pistils. likewise, a few duplicated gene pairs  have undergone expression divergence in soybean  <cit> . the response mechanisms of the two gene families varied for the different types of stresses. in this study, the bript5- <dig> was continuously induced by salt treatment, with 7-fold elevated expression levels. however, brckx1- <dig> was suppressed, with dropped expression levels. the expressions of the majority of the ckx family in arabidopsis, namely, ckx <dig>  ckx <dig>  ckx <dig>  and ckx <dig>  decreased with salt treatment; whereas expressions of the remaining three genes  increased  <cit> . meanwhile, increasing evidence indicated that the response to environmental stresses for plant ipt and ckx genes was tissue or organ-dependent. stress induced zmckx <dig> expressions in leaves, but it had an opposite effect in roots  <cit> . the induction levels in the v6-stage leaves of soybean were correlated with the age of the trifoliate leaves; the older the leaf, the higher the induction. gmipt <dig> and gmipt <dig> were significantly induced by drought in the v6-stage leaves; the degree of induction of these genes was higher in the younger trifoliate leaves  <cit> . all these proofs strongly supported the hypothesis that daughter genes originated from a common parental gene might adopt part of the functions of their parental gene  <cit>  or acquire new functions  <cit> .

the possible roles of trna ipt genes in plants
three trna ipt genes  were identified to have unique gene structures and expression patterns in b. rapa. atipt <dig>  atipt <dig>  zmipt <dig>  zmipt <dig>  osipt <dig>  and osipt <dig> likewise belong to this group of trna ipt genes. the trna ipt genes are responsible for the synthesis of cz-type cks. based on the data from various bioassays  <cit> , the tz was found to be a bioactive substance whereas cz was reported to have a weak biological effect. moreover, the 35s-linked atipt <dig> did not induce ck responses in calli when cks were absent  <cit> . despite the presumed inactivity of cz as a free hormone, the presence of free cz-type cks in plant tissues has been repeatedly reported. some plant species contain detectable levels of diverse cz-type cks, which are occasionally the predominant group of total cks. gajdosova et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that the cz-type cks may function as delicate regulators of the ck responses in plants under growth-limiting conditions. similar to atipt <dig> and atipt <dig>  bript <dig>  bript9- <dig>  and bript9- <dig>  were ubiquitously expressed. the trna ipt genes in b. rapa notably responded to adverse environmental stresses, thereby indicating that the cz biosynthesized by trna ipt genes may be also involved in stress resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this study we identified  <dig> ipt and  <dig> ckx genes in chinese cabbage genome. the gene structures, conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. duplications, evolutionary patterns and divergence of the ipt and ckx genes were investigated. we also characterized their expression patterns in various tissues and organs, their responses to abiotic stresses and exogenous phytohormones. to date, this is the first genome-wide study of the ipt and ckx gene families in b. rapa. our results will help to enhance the understanding of the evolution of dynamic functions and fates for these bript and brckx genes. chinese cabbage is one of the most important vegetables and is widely cultivated. unveiling the roles of bript and brckx genes in plant growth, development and stress adaptation processes may help molecular breeders to develop economically important high-yielding and high-quality stress-tolerant crops in agriculture.
