BACKGROUND
since lancefield group g streptococci  have been considered components of the normal flora of the human throat, skin, and genitourinary tract, the contributions of ggs to streptococcal disease have often been overlooked  <cit> . over the last decade, however, infections by pathogenic ggs have been reported, including life-threatening invasive β-hemolytic streptococcal disease  <cit> , making it necessary to expand our knowledge of the pathogenesis of ggs infections, especially invasive infections. several species of streptococci can carry group c and g antigens, including streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis , s. canis, s. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi , s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus , and s. anginosus group bacteria. sdse, which consists of lancefield group g and c bacteria, in a ratio of about 4: <dig>  <cit> , has been isolated from patients at higher frequency than other ggs and gcs species. for example, of  <dig> strains of gcs and ggs isolated from clinical samples in southern india between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>  were sdse  <cit> , as were 80% of the  <dig> invasive non-a and non-b β-hemolytic streptococcal isolates in the usa  <cit> . the spectrum and clinical courses of sdse infection, including pharyngitis, cellulitis, infective arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome , show substantial overlap with those of gas  <cit> . despite the increased clinical importance of sdse, however, the entire sdse genome has not yet been sequenced. knowledge of its entire genome sequence is fundamental to gain insights into the pathogenicity of sdse. we describe here the entire genome sequence of a lancefield group g sdse strain, ggs_ <dig>  which had been isolated from a patient with stss.

RESULTS
selection of an sdse isolate for genome sequencing
we chose a clinical isolate of sdse, strain ggs_ <dig>  for genome sequence determination for several reasons. first, ggs_ <dig> belongs to lancefield group g, to which most clinical isolates of sdse also belong  <cit> . second, ggs_ <dig> caused stss in a patient. third, ggs_ <dig> was the most virulent strain among  <dig> group g sdse isolates, as determined by their ld <dig> values in a mouse infection model .

stss/non-
ld <dig> values of the isolates were determined as described in materials and methods.

overview of the sdse ggs_ <dig> genome sequence
we found that, similar to other streptococcal genomes, the sdse ggs_ <dig> genome consists of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp  and has a g+c content of  <dig> % . based on its location in the intergenic region upstream of the dnaa gene , the gc skew, and the clustering of dnaa box motifs, the start point of the sdse ggs_ <dig> genome was assigned to the putative origin of replication . an at-rich 13-mer , located in the intergenic region upstream of the dnaa gene  <cit> , was selected as the starting point for nucleotide numbering. the ggs_ <dig> genome was shown to contain  <dig> predicted coding sequences , which account for  <dig>  mbp  of the genome. in addition, this genome was shown to harbor  <dig> prophage-like elements, designated Φggs_ <dig> , Φggs_ <dig> , and Φggs_ <dig> . moreover, there were  <dig> insertion sequence  elements throughout the genome.

genome sequence homology analysis of ggs_ <dig> with the other  <dig> sequenced streptococcal species and subspecies showed that ggs_ <dig> was closest in sequence to gas, with 72% similarity . ggs_ <dig> was less similar to sesz and sese, with 65% and 64% coverage. although s. agalactiae is the closest-relati1ve of sdse based on 16s rrna analysis, the s. agalactiae strains were less similar to sdse than gas based on the genome wide comparison . in addition, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of all sequenced streptococcus species based on the neighbor-joining method . although neighbor-joining methods are less accurate than the other methods such as most likelihood methods, sdse is clustered with the gas strains as their closest relative.

we compared the gene organization of ggs_ <dig> with that of gas by genomic rearrangement analyses . gas could be divided roughly into  <dig> groups according to the orientation of the genes  <cit> . therefore, ssi- <dig> and mgas <dig>  both of which are m <dig> serotype strains and have opposite gene orientations from each other, were chosen for the analysis. we found that the ggs_ <dig> genome was organizationally more similar to that of gas strain mgas <dig> than gas strain ssi- <dig> . interestingly, the colinearity of ggs_ <dig> and s. uberis genomes was quite remarkable but the percent amino acid identity was lower than that of the gas strains . the gene structure of ggs_ <dig> was similar to the structures of gas strain ssi- <dig>  sesz strain mgcs <dig>  and sese strain  <dig>  although the ggs_ <dig> genome contains large-scale genomic rearrangements. the ggs_ <dig> genome differed markedly in gene organization from the genome of gbs strain a <dig> 

when we compared genes from ggs_ <dig> and two relatively homologous species, gas  and sesz  , we found that these three streptococcal genomes contain more than  <dig>  orthologous genes, accounting for 59% of the total cdss of ggs_ <dig>  ggs_ <dig> shares  <dig> genes with mgas <dig> and  <dig> genes with mgcs <dig>  moreover,  <dig> % of the genes of ggs_ <dig> were homologous to gas genes, with  <dig> % amino acid identity, whereas  <dig> % of ggs_ <dig> genes were homologous to mgcs <dig> genes, with  <dig> % amino acid identity. these findings indicate that sdse is closely related to gas in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

we also analyzed the distribution of genes shown to be more homologous to genes derived from bacteria other than gas . we found that  <dig> genes showed higher similarity to genes from streptococci other than gas and  <dig> genes showed higher similarity to genes from a genus other than streptococcus. in addition, we identified  <dig> genes that did not show significant homology to any genes in the databases. these genes were scattered throughout the entire ggs_ <dig> genome, suggesting that they had not been acquired by massive genome recombination.

putative prophages and crispr/cas
we found that all three prophage-like elements of ggs_ <dig> were homologous to previously sequenced gas prophages, and that they were integrated at sites similar to those of gas strains, with the same upstream and downstream genes .

 prophage ggs_ <dig> 
we found that the Φggs_ <dig>  prophage is  <dig>  bp in length with a g+c content of  <dig> % and carries  <dig> cds. ninety-seven percent of the cds in Φggs_ <dig>  have homologues, with more than 40% identity to gas prophages, suggesting that Φggs_ <dig>  is a chimeric phage. this prophage was inserted at the predicted bacteriophage t12att site, which has been shown to be a gene that encodes a serine trna and is located between the cds of sdeg_ <dig> and sdeg_ <dig>  <cit> . six gas strains, mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  and ssi- <dig>  have prophage elements: Φ <dig> , which carries spek and the streptococcal phospholipase a <dig> gene ; Φ <dig> , which carries ssa; Φ <dig> , which carries spea; Φ <dig> , which carries the spec and dnase  genes; Φ <dig> , which carries spel and spem; and spsp <dig>  which carries spec, respectively  <cit> . in addition, Φggs_ <dig>  was found to contain a prophage-associated virulence factor gene for deoxyribonuclease .

 prophage ggs_ <dig> 
we found that the Φggs_ <dig>  prophage is  <dig>  bp in length, with a g+c content of  <dig> % and  <dig> cds. ninety-five percent of the cds in Φggs_ <dig>  have homology with genes in gas prophages, making it likely that Φggs_ <dig>  is chimeric phage. the chromosomal phage attachment site  and the Φggs_ <dig>  phage-encoded attachment site  were not found, but the products of attp/attb recombination, attl and attr, with the same sequences as those of gas prophages spsp <dig> and Φ <dig>  were identified. the genome context around the integration site for Φggs_ <dig>  was found to be conserved at the phage integration sites of  <dig> gas strains, mgas <dig>  mgas <dig>  ssi- <dig>  and manfredo, which contain the prophage elements Φ <dig> , carrying sdn; Φ <dig> , carrying spea; spsp <dig>  carrying spea; and phiman. <dig>  carrying the dnase gene mf <dig>  respectively  <cit> . no known prophage-associated virulence factor genes were found in Φggs_ <dig> .

 prophage ggs_ <dig> 
we also found a prophage remnant, Φggs_ <dig> , which was about  <dig>  kb length and homologous to the previously sequenced gas prophage remnants Φ <dig>  and Φ <dig>  with a nucleotide identity of 73%. Φggs_ <dig>  and the two gas phage remnants were found to be located between genes encoding a putative transcriptional regulator protein and the 30s ribosomal protein. in strain ggs_ <dig>  two truncated transposase proteins, sdeg_ <dig> and sdeg_ <dig>  were found to be inserted upstream of ggs_ <dig> . no virulence factor genes are present in ggs_ <dig> .

prokaryotes possess a system that mediates resistance to infection by foreign dna, such as viruses  <cit> . when bacteria are exposed to phages, short fragments derived from phage dna are integrated into clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  regions of the bacterial genome as spacers  <cit> . crispr rna transcripts and crisr-associated proteins , act in complexes to interfere with virus proliferation  <cit> . this system has also been observed in gas  <cit> , sesz  <cit> , s. mutans  <cit> , and s. thermophilus  <cit> . ggs_ <dig> harbors a crispr/cas system consisting of an array of genes, can <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  and csn <dig>  and crispr . the ggs_ <dig> crispr has  <dig> direct repeats of  <dig> bp each and  <dig> spacer sequences  <dig> or  <dig> bp in length;  <dig> of these sequences are homologous to gas prophage sequences, with more than 80% coverage . when we analyzed the number of crispr spacers in an additional  <dig> sdse isolates , we found that the mean number of crispr spacers was higher in sdse  than in gas strains  . these results suggest that prophage infection of sdse is somewhat restricted, resulting in a smaller number of virulence factors located in the prophage regions of sdse. alternatively, sdse may be in contact with phages more frequently, with integrated phages having a fitness cost for sdse.

n.d.: no amplicon was obtained in pcr analyses.

virulence factors encoded by the ggs_ <dig> genome
an analysis of  <dig> sdse strains isolated from human infections using targeted microarrays containing  <dig> gas virulence genes composed of 70mer oligonucleotides showed that about 50% of the gas virulence genes represented in the microarray were present in sdse  <cit> . three molecular markers, speb, the intergenic region upstream of the scpg gene and virpcr, have been shown helpful in discriminating between gas and sdse  <cit> . based on homology analyses with known bacterial virulence factors, such as pore-forming toxins, a superantigen, proteases, fct-like regions, adhesins, hyaluronidase, and a nuclease, we identified  <dig> putative virulence factor genes in the ggs_ <dig> genome; their details are shown in additional file  <dig>  comparison of the virulence factors in ggs_ <dig> with those of other streptococcal species indicated that the putative virulence factors most similar to those of ggs_ <dig> were found in gas. in contrast, superantigen, spe-b and the has operon of gas are not conserved in ggs_ <dig> 

. pore-forming toxins
ggs_ <dig> has several putative hemolysins, including hlyx , hlyiii , and hlya <dig> , which have also been detected in gas, sesz, sese, s. uberis, and gbs. ggs_ <dig> also has genes encoding streptolysin s   and its biosynthesis proteins  , which are also present in gas  <cit> , sesz, and sese  <cit> . in addition, ggs_ <dig> carries a gene for streptolysin o  , which is essential for gas virulence and is required for the organism to escape from the endosome into the cytosol following invasion of host cells  <cit> .

. superantigen
ggs_ <dig> possesses only one superantigen gene, exotoxin g variant  <dig> , which is homologous to gas streptococcal exotoxin g , with 79% amino acid identity . in a previous analysis of the superantigenic activities of the spegg <dig> product in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit> , we found that its mitogenic activity was about 1% that of speg from gas. other genome-encoded superantigen genes for mitogenic exotoxin z , which are present in gas  <cit> , were not found in the ggs_ <dig> genome.

 proteases
we found that a putative proteinase  and streptococcal c5a peptidase    <cit>  were conserved among ggs_ <dig> and  <dig> closely related species. ggs_ <dig> also has a gene with homology  to exfoliative toxin a of staphylococcus aureus strain mu <dig> , which causes staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome  <cit> . ggs_ <dig> also carries a gene for streptokinase , similar to streptokinase a of gas, with 88% amino acid identity . this protein complexes with plasminogen to form an activator, which has serine protease activity and cleaves free plasminogen. leading to activation of the zymogen  <cit> . strikingly, ggs_ <dig> lacks streptococcal cysteine protease , an erythrogenic toxin produced by gas with cysteine protease activity  <cit> . the ggs_ <dig> genome lacks approximately  <dig> kb of the gas strain mgas <dig> sequence, including genes encoding speb , the transcriptional regulator ropb , and mitogenic factor 25k precursor . since several transposase and related genes  are located in the corresponding region, it is highly likely that the region that included speb was present in the common ancestor of gas and sdse but was not retained by sdse after speciation.

we found that speb was not present in ggs_ <dig>  in agreement with the results of a microarray study, which showed that all of the  <dig> examined strains of group c and g sdse isolated from patients lacked the speb gene  <cit> . we therefore examined whether sdse strains have protease activity similar to that of speb . we did not detect any speb-like protease activity in strains ggs_ <dig> or ggs_ <dig>  which had been isolated from two patients with stss. in contrast, a gas strain produced a proteinase that was sensitive to e- <dig>  which inhibits cysteine proteases, including speb.

 fct-like regions
recently, gas and gbs were shown to express pili, which are synthesized by proteins encoded by genes in fct regions  <cit> . ggs_ <dig> harbors  <dig> fct-like regions, which are probable operons expressing different pilus-like structures . one of these contains genes encoding the transcriptional regulator rofa , two putative fimbrial structural subunit proteins , two sortases , and a putative fibronectin binding protein . it is similar to the fct- <dig> region, which is conserved among m <dig> gas, gbs, and sesz  <cit> . the second region contains genes encoding a putative transcriptional regulator , a defective collagen binding protein , a signal peptidase i , a backbone protein , and an ancillary protein . it is similar to the fct- <dig> region, which was found in m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> gas  <cit> .

 adhesins
ggs_ <dig> possesses genes that encode putative adhesion proteins, including proteins similar to putative fibronectin binding proteins , pullulanase , phosphopyruvate hydratase , laminin binding protein , internalin protein , and collagen binding protein , all of which bind to the extracellular matrix . sggs_ <dig> also possesses genes encoding immunoglobulin g binding protein   <cit>  and multifunctional streptococcal plasmin receptor /streptococcal surface dehydrogenase /glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which binds to complement component c5a   <cit>  , although the product of sdeg_ <dig> lacks a signal peptide.

 hyaluronan capsule synthesis
hyaluronic acid , synthesized via the hasabc operon, is considered a pleiotropic virulence factor involved in many aspects of gas infection  <cit> . ggs_ <dig>  however, does not contain an hasabc operon, in contrast to the genomes of gas, sesz, sese, and s. uberis. rather, ggs_ <dig> possesses only one gene, encoding glycosyl transferase , which shows a low level of similarity to hasa of gas . although one sdse strain has been shown to possess a hyaluronan synthase , very similar to the product of hasa  <cit> , gas gene microarray analysis of  <dig> sdse strains isolated from human infections showed that all harbored only hasc  <cit> . we found that ggs_ <dig> also harbors only hasc  , making it unlikely that sdse produces ha via the hasabc operon.

 hyaluronidase
ggs_ <dig> possesses a gene in a non-prophage region of the genome that encodes a putative hyaluronidase , with 66% identity to hylb in sesz . hyaluronidase in gas is thought to contribute to the spread of bacteria in tissues and may allow gas to utilize host hyaluronic acid or its own capsule as an energy source  <cit> . the hyaluronidase in ggs_ <dig> may have a function similar to that in gas.

 nucleases
ggs_ <dig> possesses  <dig> genes that encode putative nucleases with a secretion signal peptide: genome-encoded streptodornase , extracellular nuclease , dna-entry nuclease , cell surface 5'-nucleotidase , and prophage-associated deoxyribonuclease , all of which are predicted to code for a secretion signal peptide. two of them, sdeg_ <dig> and sdeg_ <dig>  code for potential cell wall anchor motifs, lpkag and lpmag, respectively . the putative streptodornase sdeg_ <dig> and dna-entry nuclease sdeg_ <dig> are homologous to phage-encoded extracellular streptodornase d sda <dig> of gas   <cit>  and dna-entry nuclease enda of s. pneumoniae tigr <dig>   <cit> , respectively . sda <dig> and enda have been found to degrade neutrophil extracellular traps   <cit> , which are composed of granule proteins and chromatin released by neutrophils and can catch and kill surrounding bacteria  <cit> . the putative extracellular dnase sdeg_ <dig> is similar to m <dig> gas cell-wall-located dnase spna , which has been reported important for virulence, e.g., dispersion in host tissue  <cit>  .

 other virulence factors
ggs_ <dig> possesses genes encoding the multifunctional m protein  . the m protein of gas shows antiphagocytic and adhesin activities, whereas the adhesion function of the ggs m protein may be due to a collagen binding motif  <cit> . since the product of stg <dig>  lacks this motif, the m protein of ggs_ <dig> may not act as an adhesin.

streptococcal inhibitor of complement  and distantly related to sic  are some extent of homology. drs binds complement factors but does not inhibit complement mediated cell lysis  <cit> , whereas sic inhibits complement mediated cell lysis  <cit> . ggs_ <dig> harbors a putative drs gene , which consists of a signal sequence, two repeat regions, and a proline-rich region typical of drs, and is homologous to the drs <dig>  protein of gas strain emm <dig> with 48% amino acid identity  <cit>  .

the ggs_ <dig> genome harbors a gene encoding a collagen-like protein , similar to the collagen-like repeat phage protein of sese  <dig> , with 41% amino acid identity. streptococcal collagen-like proteins  are cell-surface molecules of gas with domains containing tracks of repeated gly-xaa-yaa sequences that form a mammalian collagen-like triple-helical structure. these proteins mediate the internalization of gas into human cells upon binding of scl to the human collagen receptor integrin  <cit> . the ggs_ <dig> gene encoding collagen-like protein does not contain a signal peptide or lpxtg motif, suggesting that the gene product may not be expressed on the cell surface. in contrast, ggs_ <dig> does not harbor genes encoding proteins similar to the other collagen-like proteins  in gas.

nad glycohydrolase , which is located in the nadase-streptolysin o operon of the gas genome  <cit> , was found to be conserved in the same operon in ggs_ <dig> . this enzyme is expressed after streptolysin o is injected into host cells and accelerates cell death  <cit> .

 distribution of virulence factors among streptococci
we also assessed the presence or absence of representative virulence factors among sequenced streptococcal species, including gas , sese , sesz , gbs , and s. uberis  . among  <dig> virulence factors, most of those located in the core genome, but not those located in streptococcal phages, are conserved in ggs_ <dig>  except for speb. in contrast, other streptococci lack genes encoding streptolysin o, nad glycohydrolase and drs , suggesting the importance of these proteins in the pathogenicity of sdse and gas in humans, causing stss.

putative virulence factors unique to sdse
we identified  <dig> gene products in ggs_ <dig> containing signal peptides and lpxtg cell wall surface anchor motifs that showed low similarity to known proteins. using pcr, we analyzed the distributions of these putative virulence factors in  <dig> sdse isolates . a putative t-antigen-like protein structural subunit , encoded in the fct-6-like region in ggs_ <dig>  was detected in the  <dig> most virulent strains, ggs_ <dig>  ggs_ <dig>  and ggs_ <dig>  in both ggs_ <dig> and ggs_ <dig>  the fct-6-like region was not detected by pcr . interestingly, the sdeg_ <dig> gene encoding a functionally unknown hypothetical protein was amplified in isolates that cause stss. however, no virulence factors associated with mouse lethality or lancefield groups were found.

genes encoding proteins, which contain predicted signal peptide based on signalp http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/signalp and the lpxtg motif based on hmmer http://bamics <dig> cmbi.kun.nl/jos/sortase_substrates/help.html and were not highly homologous to putative virulence factors of ggs_ <dig>  distribution of the putative virulence factors of ggs_ <dig> in the  <dig> sdse strains was analyzed by pcr, and the results are presented as sdse strains in order of decreasing lethality in mice. yes: pcr analysis postive; x: pcr analysis negative.

relatedness of emm type and pathogenicity in sdse
particular m  types of gas have been associated with certain streptococcal diseases  <cit> . in investigating the pathogenic traits of m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> gas clinical isolates in a murine model  <cit> , we found that murine lethality was closely associated with m type. the m <dig> and m <dig> types of gas, which are isolated at high frequency from patients with stss, showed higher virulence in mice than did m <dig> and m <dig>  using this mouse model, we assessed the virulence of the emm types of  <dig> group g sdse isolates to analyze whether most frequent emm-type of isolates in epidemiological studies  are more virulent in mice . we found that the lethality in mice of these isolates was not associated with their isolation from patients with stss or with the frequently isolated emm-type in humans such as stg <dig>  and stg <dig>  . to determine whether the emm type of sdse was associated with pathogenicity in humans, we reviewed the epidemiological data regarding the isolation frequencies of gcs and ggs in relation to their emm types  <cit>  . we found that stg <dig>  was the most frequent emm type in portugal and japan, stg <dig>  was the most frequent in western norway, and stg <dig>  was the most frequent in the usa. when we calculated the degree of correspondence among the isolation rates of emm types in each area using the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient, we found no significant correlations among all regions , suggesting that there is no linkage between emm type of sdse and infectivity in humans or mice.

discussion
comparative analysis of streptococcus 16s rrna sequences had indicated that sdse was more closely related to gbs than to gas  <cit> . in contrast, we found that sdse, which belongs to lancefield groups c and g  <cit> , is more closely related to gas than to other sequenced streptococci based on genome wide and gene level comparisons

sdse is known to cause diseases very similar to those caused by gas, such as pharyngitis, cellulitis, infective arthritis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and stss  <cit> . this similarity may be due, at least in part, to their conservation of a large number of genes for virulence factors. figure  <dig> shows a summary of putative virulence factors and proposed virulence functions in sdse. sdse shares most of the virulence factor genes of gas, including streptolysin o, streptokinase, fct-like regions, nadase, and drs. however, ggs_ <dig> and probably almost all other sdses lack speb, superantigens except for speg, and hyaluronan synthesis via hasabc  <cit> . as spegg <dig>  which has about 1% of the mitogenic activity of gas-derived speg, is the only gene encoding a protein homologous to superantigens, and most sdse isolates do not harbor superantigen-like genes other than spegg  <cit> , it is highly unlikely that superantigens play a significant role in the pathogenesis of sdse infection in humans.

particular m  types of gas have been associated with certain streptococcal diseases  <cit> . we therefore analyzed the virulence in a mouse model of several sdse strains bearing different emm-types, but we were unable to find a significant correlation between emm-type of sdse and virulence. further studies are needed to provide further insight into the linkage between emm type of sdse and infectivity in humans.

streptococcal phages are considered critical in horizontal gene transfer, especially in the transport of virulence factors  <cit> , in streptococci. three prophage elements in ggs_ <dig> were found to be homologous to gas prophages in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. the positions of prophage insertion were also conserved between ggs_ <dig> and previously sequenced gas prophages, suggesting that sdse and gas share the same phage species, and that horizontal gene transfer between sdse and gas has occurred. however, ggs_ <dig> does not contain prophages that encode genes for superantigens, sla, or mf. these phage encoded genes were also missing from all strains previously analyzed by a gas microarray  <cit> . sdn is an exception, since it was detected in  <dig> of these  <dig> sdse strains  <cit> . these results showed that sdse may have some resistance to infection by gas phages carrying genes encoding virulence factors.

prokaryotes possess the crispr/cas system, which mediates resistance to infection by foreign dna, such as viruses  <cit> . ggs_ <dig> has a crispr/cas system, designated crispr1/cas, whereas the other sdse isolates analyzed in this study had another crispr/cas system, designated crispr2/cas. we found that sdse strains usually have a higher total number of spacers than gas, suggesting that prophage infection of sdse was restricted to some extent, resulting in a smaller number of virulence factors located in the prophage regions of sdse. similar restrictions were observed in sesz when compared with sese. for example, the sese  <dig> genome, which contains no crispr, contains genes encoding virulence factors in prophage regions. in contrast, sesz mgcs <dig> and h <dig>  which contain  <dig> and  <dig> spacers, respectively, do not carry any prophages. thus, the crispr system in streptococci sharing prophages may play a substantial role in the spread of virulence factors among species. alternatively, these virulence factors may not benefit to sdse during carriage or disease, such that the integration of these specific phages is not selected for.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown here that sdse likely acts as a pathogen, based on its genome sequence and close relationship with gas. as the frequency of isolation of sdse from patients has increased, it should not be overlooked as a source of infection.
