BACKGROUND
the pregnane x receptor  is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor  superfamily  <cit> . pxr functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor and regulates the metabolism, transport, and excretion of exogenous compounds, steroid hormones, vitamins, bile salts, and xenobiotics. a remarkably diverse array of compounds activate human pxr, although generally only at micromolar concentrations , consistent with a hypothesized function of pxr as a toxic compound sensor  <cit>  .

pxr genes have been cloned and functionally characterized from a variety of vertebrate species, including human, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, pig, chicken, frog, and zebrafish  <cit> . like other nrs, pxrs have a modular structure with two major domains: an n-terminal dna-binding domain  and a larger c-terminal ligand-binding domain . the pxr lbd is unusually divergent across species, compared to other nrs, with only 50% sequence identity between mammalian and non-mammalian pxr sequences; other nrs tend to have corresponding sequence identities at least 10–20% higher  <cit> . even the pxr dbd, which is more highly conserved across species than the lbd, shows more cross-species sequence diversity than other nrs  <cit> . a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the entire vertebrate nr superfamily demonstrated evidence of positive evolutionary selection for the lbd of pxrs  <cit> .

in this study, we compare in detail the selectivity of human and zebrafish pxrs for steroid hormones and related compounds. we also compare human, mouse, rat, rabbit, chicken, frog, and zebrafish pxrs with a set of common compounds that activate most pxrs. these in vitro data are used to develop pharmacophore models to capture the essential structural and chemical features of activators of these pxrs . commonly used features in pharmacophore models include hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrogen bond donor, and excluded volumes .

we sought to probe the distant evolutionary history of pxr and the related vitamin d receptor  by studying an invertebrate nr1i-like receptor. the draft genome of the chordate invertebrate ciona intestinalis  revealed a single gene  with close sequence similarity to the vertebrate vdrs, pxrs, and constitutive androstane receptors   <cit>  . nr1i-like genes were also detected in the genomes of the fruitfly  and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , although these genes have yet to be functionally characterized. the draft genome of the purple sea urchin  revealed several putative nr1h-like genes but no nr1i-like genes  <cit> . the early evolutionary history of the nr1i subfamily  in vertebrates is not completely clear, but one hypothesis is that a single ancestral 'vdr/pxr' gene duplicated, with the two genes then diverging into distinct vdrs and pxrs, both of which are currently found in both mammalian and non-mammalian species  <cit> . we follow the convention of referring to the non-mammalian pxr/car-like genes as pxrs  <cit> , although it is not clear whether the function of the single gene in fishes and chicken is more similar to mammalian car or pxr  <cit> . the duplication of a single vdr/pxr gene into two different genes may have occurred during a complex series of gene duplications that are thought to have occurred in early vertebrate evolution, based on analysis of lamprey and hagfish genes  <cit> . later in vertebrate evolution , a single pxr-like ancestral gene then duplicated with subsequent divergence into the separate pxr and car genes found in all mammals sequenced thus far  <cit> . for simplicity, the single ciona intestinalis nr1i-like gene will be referred to as 'ciona vdr/pxr'. one advantage of studying ciona intestinalis, in addition to the genome project data available, is that this animal is a member of urochordata, a subphylum now thought to contain the closest extant relatives of modern vertebrates  <cit> .

from the ghost database of ciona intestinalis genomic and cdna resources  <cit> , cdna clone ids ciem829d <dig> and cilv048e <dig> correspond to the ciona vdr/pxr. based on the expressed sequence tag counts, these cdnas show highest expression in the larvae and juvenile life stages and lower expression in eggs, cleaving embryos, young adults, and mature adults. for adult animals, expression was seen in gonadal tissue and blood cells. although invertebrates are not known to produce and utilize vitamin d pathways, we speculated that the ciona vdr/pxr may bind ligands structurally similar to vitamin d, based on the subsequent evolutionary development and ligand preferences of vertebrate vdrs. alternatively, the ciona vdr/pxr may function more like vertebrate pxrs, and assist in protection from toxic levels of endogenous and/or exogenous compounds, in which case it might bind a diverse array of ligands. we therefore cloned and expressed the ciona vdr/pxr to determine how similar this receptor is to vertebrate nr1i receptors in terms of activation by ligands.

RESULTS
selectivity of human pxr
we first assessed the ability of a diverse set of compounds to activate human pxr by determining detailed concentration-response curves for activation of human pxr for  <dig> androstane steroids ,  <dig> estrane steroids ,  <dig> pregnane steroids ,  <dig> bile salts , and  <dig> additional diverse compounds that included xenobiotics and vitamins  . these activation data further confirm the broad ligand specificity of human pxr, with most compounds only activating at micromolar concentrations.

activities are in -log, with ec <dig> in molar units for the activation of human or zebrafish pxr. efficacy is relative to  <dig> μm rifampicin  or  <dig> μm 5α-androstan-3α-ol  which are assigned an efficacy of  <dig> . toxicity is the lowest concentration in micromolar that produced significant toxicity in the hepg <dig> cells.

comparison of human and zebrafish pxrs
in two prior studies that compared pxrs from different species, human and zebrafish pxrs were found to share some activating ligands, including pregnanes, androstanes, and a few xenobiotics such as nifedipine and phenobarbital  <cit> . activation of zebrafish pxr by the much larger set of  <dig> compounds tested on human pxr was determined in this study, and these two species showed considerable overlap in their ligand specificity . human pxr has very broad specificity for steroid hormones and their synthetic intermediates  albeit mostly at micromolar concentrations likely to exceed typical physiologic concentrations  <cit> .

zebrafish pxr was activated by far fewer steroid compounds which were essentially a subset of those that activate human pxr . for both human and zebrafish pxrs, pregnane steroids showed the highest activity . human and zebrafish pxrs showed more differences in regard to bile salt activators with zebrafish pxr being activated by very few of the bile salts tested . in terms of the evolution of bile salts, human pxr is activated by both evolutionary 'early' bile salts  <cit>   and 'recent' bile salts  . zebrafish pxr is activated only by early bile salts, including 5α-cyprinol sulfate and 5β-scymnol  27-sulfate . the results are consistent with crystallographic studies of human pxr that show a large, flexible ligand-binding pocket  <cit> . this pocket can accommodate bile salts of both 5α  and 5β  orientation , as well as those with differing side-chain lengths and conjugation. this is in contrast to studies of farnesoid x receptors  and vdrs, two other nrs that are activated by bile acids  <cit> . in particular, fxrs are antagonized by 5α-bile alcohol sulfates  <cit>  while vdrs are essentially only activated by the smallest bile salt, lithocholic acid , and its metabolites  <cit> .

pharmacophore models for six pxrs
in a comparative study, we determined concentration-response curves for a common set of  <dig> compounds  in a set of pxrs from six species . the pharmacophores generated are shown mapped to two of the generally more active ligands,  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  and 5β-pregnane- <dig> -dione . human, rat, and mouse pxrs showed very similar pharmacophores with 4– <dig> hydrophobic features and multiple excluded volumes . the pharmacophores for these three pxrs all suggest generally large ligand-binding pockets with differences only in positions of the features. it is interesting that compared with previous pharmacophores for human pxr  <cit>  which contained 4– <dig> hydrophobic features and at least 1– <dig> hydrogen bonding moieties, there are no hydrogen bonding features in the current human pxr pharmacophore. this could be due to the molecules used in the current training set being mostly bile salts and having active and inactive compounds with similar features. as the catalyst pharmacophore generation method looks for differences between the extremes of activity to describe the features contributing to the pharmacophore, this may represent a limitation of the method. while a single universal pharmacophore for human pxr  may be impossible due to the size and flexibility of the binding site, it is likely in the current study that the  <dig> selected molecules may just be a sub-section of the binding pocket. for example, this may be where steroidal compounds fit  <cit>  as modelled previously with a pharmacophore  <cit> . therefore, the pharmacophores serve as a novel qualitative method for analysis of pxr ligand specificity across the species.

activities are in -log, with ec <dig> in molar units for the activation of mouse, rat, rabbit, or chicken pxrs. efficacy is relative to  <dig> μm pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile ,  <dig> μm 5α-pregnan- <dig> -dione , or  <dig> μm nifedipine  which are assigned an efficacy of  <dig> . the training set consists of the  <dig> compounds highlighted in bold font.

zebrafish pxr showed the most constrained pharmacophore based on the  <dig> ligands, suggesting a small binding pocket compared with the other pxrs, consisting of  <dig> hydrophobes,  <dig> hydrogen bond acceptor, and excluded volumes . rabbit pxr had a similar pharmacophore model to zebrafish pxr but no excluded volumes as in the former . chicken pxr had a pharmacophore qualitatively different from the other pxrs, with the model indicating a symmetrical array of features that contribute to activity ; it is perhaps noteworthy that this pxr has a smaller 'insert' sequence between helices  <dig> and  <dig> of the lbd than that of human, mouse, rat, and rabbit pxrs  <cit> . the pharmacophore models for both chicken and zebrafish pxrs also show a hydrogen bond acceptor not found in the models for pxrs from other species ; this hydrogen bonding interaction may contribute to the relatively high activity of tcdd in chicken and zebrafish pxrs. pharmacophore statistical summaries are presented in additional file  <dig> 

unusual pharmacology of xenopus frog pxrs
whereas other vertebrates such as human, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish have a single pxr gene in their respective genomes, two pxrs have been identified in the african clawed frog   <cit> . this is likely a consequence of the tetraploidy of the x. laevis genome  <cit> . the phylogeny confirms that these two genes are bone fide orthlogs to mammalian pxr; however their pharmacology and tissue expression pattern is markedly different  <cit> . xenopus laevis pxrs are alternatively termed 'benzoate x receptors'  due to their activation by endogenous benzoates  that play a role in frog development  <cit> . similar benzoates have yet to be characterized in other animals, suggesting that these may be unique to amphibians. in addition to pxrs, other gene families show divergence in xenopus laevis relative to other vertebrates. per-arnt-sim  proteins such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  nuclear translocator are an example  <cit> .

our search of the sequenced genome of the related western clawed frog  revealed only a single pxr gene. cloning of the lbd of this pxr from adult female ovary and expression in a gal4-lbd chimeric construct allowed for determination of ligand specificity. similar to studies of the xenopus laevis pxrs, the xenopus tropicalis pxr was insensitive to steroids, vitamins, and xenobiotics that activate mammalian or chicken pxrs, but was activated by two benzoates described as activators of the xenopus laevis pxrα   <cit> .

properties of the ciona intestinalis vdr/pxr
sequencing of the ciona intestinalis genome revealed a single gene with similarity to vertebrate nr1i genes vdr, pxr, and car  <cit> . we previously reported a preliminary analysis of the ciona vdr/pxr  <cit>  and now present more detailed data. while the dbd of the ciona vdr/pxr can be easily aligned to the corresponding sequence of vertebrate vdrs, pxrs, and cars, alignment of the lbd is difficult in some regions . as summarized in table  <dig>  the lbd of ciona vdr/pxr has low sequence identity to vertebrate vdrs, pxrs, and cars . in the dbd, the ciona vdr/pxr has the highest sequence identity to sea lamprey and zebrafish vdrs . the phylogeny of the ciona vdr/pxr, as inferred by maximum likelihood analysis, does not clearly group this receptor with either vdrs or pxrs . this likely indicates that more sequences are needed, especially additional nr1i receptors  in basal vertebrates  and chordate invertebrates. the low sequence identity between the ciona vdr/pxr and vertebrate vdrs, pxrs, and cars may be a result of rapid evolution, which has been detected in some gene families  in ciona intestinalis and other tunicates  <cit> .

the lbd of ciona vdr/pxr was cloned from cdna fragments generously provided by professors yuji kohara and norituki satoh, and then inserted into the pm2-gal <dig> plasmid to create an lbd/gal <dig> chimeric receptor. unlike similar constructs derived from the vertebrate vdrs, this ciona vdr/pxr was not activated by any vitamin d derivatives, vertebrate bile salts, or steroid hormones . screening of a 76-compound nuclear hormone receptor ligand library  revealed that 6-formylindolo-carbazole activated ciona vdr/pxr in the low micromolar range . 6-formylindolo-carbazole  was chosen as the reference maximal activator of ciona vdr/pxr. screening of an additional  <dig> compounds comprising steroid hormones, vitamins , benzoates, and xenobiotics revealed that carbamazepine and n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate also activated ciona vdr/pxr in the micromolar range . interestingly, 6-formylindolo-carbazole, carbamazepine, and n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate are all planar molecules.

the catalyst pharmacophore approach can also be used to generate common feature  alignments  <cit>  of the three molecules that active ciona vdr/pxr. in this case the pharmacophore consisted of  <dig> hydrogen bond acceptor and  <dig> hydrophobic areas . this pharmacophore is generally quite different compared with the models for other pxrs described above and in many ways reflects the very narrow substrate selectivity compared with the other six species.

phylogenetic analysis and ancestral reconstruction of nr1i receptors
compared to other vertebrate nr subfamilies, the evolutionary history of the nr1i subfamily is difficult to reconstruct due to a high degree of functional and sequence divergence  <cit> . some studies speculate that an ancestral gene duplicated early in vertebrate evolution , with subsequent divergence to become separate pxr and vdr genes  <cit> . later in vertebrate evolution, a single pxr gene duplicated, with subsequent divergence to form separate pxr and car genes  <cit> . throughout this manuscript, we follow the convention of designating the non-mammalian pxr/car-like genes as pxrs  <cit> , although it is not certain that the ancestral pxr/car-like gene is actually the same gene now called pxr in mammals  <cit> .

using  <dig> amino acid sequences of extant vdrs, pxrs, and cars, we inferred phylogeny by maximum likelihood . several clusters are clearly evident and supported by bootstrap analysis in the phylogeny presented in figure 4: vertebrate vdrs, mammalian cars, and mammalian pxrs. the major difficulty is the placement of the frog pxrs, which are quite different from other pxrs in function, tissue expression, and sequence  <cit> . the chicken pxr clusters with the cars in figure 4; however, by many measures, chicken pxr is equally related to mammalian cars and pxrs  <cit> .

we also utilized maximum likelihood to infer the amino acid sequence of three 'ancestral' receptors, indicated as nodes in figure  <dig> labelled as 'ancr1', 'ancr2', and 'ancr3' . ancr <dig> represents the ancestral single receptor gene prior to duplication and subsequent divergence to vdrs and pxrs. ancr <dig> represents the pxr gene ancestral to the split between fish pxrs and mammalian cars/pxrs. ancr <dig> represents the ancestral single receptor gene prior to duplication and subsequent divergence to mammalian pxrs and chicken pxr/mammalian cars. it should be pointed out that ancestral reconstruction based on receptors that are markedly divergent in sequence, particularly when there are insertions or deletions of receptors relative to one another, is subject to significant uncertainly and should be interpreted cautiously. the inter-helical regions of the lbd are particularly difficult to predict. for the lbd, the percentage of amino acid residues with posterior probability greater than  <dig>  is only  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in ancr <dig>  ancr <dig>  and ancr <dig>  respectively . these overall posterior probabilities are significantly lower than reconstruction of ancestral sex and mineralocortoid nrs   <cit> , where the cross-species sequence divergences are much less than for the nr1i subfamily of receptors. these uncertainties make homology modelling  of the lbds of reconstructed nr1i ancestral sequences unreliable. therefore, we focused on cross-sequence comparisons of amino acid residues identified as interacting with ligands in crystal structures of human vdr  <cit> , rat vdr  <cit> , zebrafish vdr  <cit> , human pxr  <cit> , human car  <cit> , and mouse car  <cit> . in this subset of 'ligand-binding residues', the percentage of amino acid residues with posterior probability greater than  <dig>  is  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in ancr <dig>  ancr <dig>  and ancr <dig>  respectively ; each of these values is higher than for the overall lbd sequence indicated above.

at the amino acid residue positions identified as ligand-binding residues, we compared ciona vdr/pxr, ancr <dig>  ancr <dig>  and ancr <dig> to mammalian pxrs , chicken pxr, xenopus laevis pxrα and pxrβ, zebrafish pxr, human car, human vdr, and sea lamprey vdr . as with overall sequence comparisons in the lbd , sequence identities at ligand-binding residues for ciona vdr/pxr compared to the other receptors were overall low . interestingly, ancr <dig> showed the highest sequence identity to human vdr ; all other sequences were less than 51% identical to ancr <dig> . this would be consistent with vdr being the ancestral nr1i receptor  <cit> . the differences between ciona vdr/pxr and ancr <dig> at the ligand-binding residue positions may be explained by rapid evolution of the ciona gene, as discussed above. ancr <dig> had the highest sequence identity at ligand-binding residues to zebrafish pxr , compared to ~ 45–50% for other pxrs and only  <dig> % to human car. ancr <dig> had highest sequence identity at ligand-binding residues to mammalian pxrs  compared to only  <dig> % to human car . the results for ancr <dig> and ancr <dig> both suggest that car has diverged the most from the ancestral sequence at ligand-binding residues and would be consistent with pxr being the ancestral gene.

intrinsic disorder analysis
a key factor in protein interactions with ligands or other proteins is presence of intrinsic structural disorder  <cit> . to assess whether disorder may account for pharmacological differences between the pxrs from different species, intrinsic disorder of the amino acid residues were predicted using the pondr vl3h algorithm  <cit>  and summarized by the percentage of residues with probability of disorder greater than 50%. disorder probabilities were analyzed by domain  or total protein sequence . rabbit pxr was shown to possess lower predicted intrinsic disorder in the lbd compared with human, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish pxrs. the african clawed frog pxrα  had the lowest predicted intrinsic disorder in the lbd of any pxr ; as discussed above, this receptor has very restricted ligand specificity, essentially responding only to benzoates  shown to be important in early frog development  <cit> . in terms of intrinsic disorder, ciona vdr/pxr was closer to pxrs than to vdrs in the lbd . the chicken pxr was distinct from the other pxrs in terms of low intrinsic disorder in the dbd; in this regard, chicken pxr is much more similar to cars . this is consistent with the hypothesis that an ancestral gene very similar to chicken pxr duplicated, with the two genes ultimately diverging into separate car and pxr genes   <cit> . in the dbd, chicken pxr may have structural features more similar to mammalian cars than pxrs. the results are consistent with differences in structural disorder possibly contributing to differences in pharmacologic specificity.

discussion
pxrs show unusually low sequence conservation in the lbd across vertebrate species relative to other nrs  <cit> . several groups have hypothesized that cross-species differences in the presence and utilization of endogenous and/or exogenous ligands have provided the evolutionary force for this divergence  <cit> . in this study, we have generated considerable new in vitro data that has enabled us to determine pharmacophore models for activation of six pxrs  using a common set of  <dig> compounds. the pharmacophore models of human, mouse, and rat pxrs are quite similar overall, while the pharmacophore models for zebrafish and chicken pxrs are significantly different compared with those for the mammalian pxrs. the in vitro and modelling data support a smaller ligand-binding pocket for zebrafish pxr. our data for the western clawed frog pxr show that this receptor, similar to african clawed frog pxrs  <cit> , may be sensitive only to benzoates and close analogs.

we also report the first characterization of the ciona intestinalis vdr/pxr. sequencing of the c. intestinalis genome reveals only a single nr1i-like gene, along with two nr1h-like genes  <cit> . the ciona 'vdr/pxr' has substantially less sequence identity in the lbd to either vdr or pxr than in the dbd, and the receptor was not activated by any of the steroids, bile salts, or vitamin d analogs tested. however, a planar ligand previously reported to activate ahrs, 6-formylindolo-carbazole  <cit>  robustly activated the ciona vdr/pxr. weaker activation was also achieved with two other planar ligands, carbamazepine  and n-butyl p-aminobenzoate , as well as several other pxrs  <cit> ). a preliminary three-point pharmacophore indicates a relatively planar pharmacophore for ciona vdr/pxr consisting of an off-center hydrogen bond acceptor flanked by two hydrophobic regions. this pharmacophore is different compared with those from the other six species described herein in that it is more restrictive. intrinsic disorder analysis also suggests that ciona vdr/pxr is more similar to pxr in the lbd than to vdr. the added disorder in the lbd  may make it able to adapt to different ligands.

our phylogenetic analysis, including reconstruction of ancestral sequences by maximum likelihood, is consistent with  the hypothesis that vdr represents the ancestral nr1i gene  <cit> . comparison of ligand-binding residue positions between extant and reconstructed ancestral sequences also suggests that pxr may represent the gene ancestral to extant mammalian cars and pxrs. identification of additional nr1i receptors in basal vertebrates, chordate invertebrates other than ciona, reptiles, and basal mammals will be valuable in developing a more complete evolutionary history in future studies.

these results are consistent with the natural ligands of ciona vdr/pxr being markedly different than those of vertebrate vdrs or pxrs. it is perhaps noteworthy that the most potent and efficacious activator of ciona vdr/pxr discovered in this study  is also a potent activator of vertebrate ahrs  <cit> . studies of invertebrate ahrs reveal markedly different ligand selectivity compared to vertebrate ahrs  <cit>  and also roles of the ahr system in invertebrate development  <cit> . future studies will be aimed at identifying possible endogenous ligands of the ciona vdr/pxr and other ciona nrs; however, if the ligands for the ciona receptor are exogenous, they may ultimately be difficult to uncover.

CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to other nuclear hormone receptors, we have demonstrated in vitro that pxrs show significant differences in ligand specificity across species. further, by pharmacophore analysis, certain pxrs share similar molecular requirements, suggestive of functional overlap. the pxr of the western clawed frog has diverged considerably in ligand selectivity from fish, bird, and mammalian pxrs. the lbd of zebrafish pxr is smaller than those of the mammals and is activated by a more limited range of compounds. even more restricted is the small set of ligands found to activate ciona vdr/pxr. taken in sum, the ligand selectivity of pxr is surprisingly species dependent, and has undergone an ever expanding role in the progression of evolution from pre-chordates to fish to mammals and birds. the combined results suggest that using a combination of in vitro and computational methods we can qualitatively explain the unusual evolutionary history shaping the ligand selectivity of pxrs and this may be applicable to other proteins.
