BACKGROUND
chromosomal abnormalities frequently contribute to human disorders including cancer  <cit>  and mental retardation   <cit> , and characterization of these dna alterations is important for both diagnosis and understanding of disease mechanisms. a surprising recent finding has been the extent to which genomic copy number variants  also exist in the normal population  <cit> . such variation may represent an important class of mutations that predispose to disease.

conventional cytogenetic studies such as karyotyping are routinely used to detect genomic deletions and duplications involving more than 5– <dig> mb, but detection of submicroscopic aberrations requires higher resolution approaches. oligonucleotide microarray technologies offer high resolution, scalable methods for whole genome screening and can detect previously unidentified cnvs  <cit> . among these approaches, the affymetrix genechip® mapping assay  <cit>  is increasingly used for detecting cnvs in human dna. this method involves a whole genome sampling analysis  combined with high-density snp genotyping oligonucleotide arrays. the first such arrays contained  <dig>  snps, and the subsequent  <dig> k arrays consisted of  <dig>  snps  <cit> . further development resulted in the  <dig> k array set with probes for  <dig>  snps  <cit> , and now the  <dig> k array set containing  <dig>  snps  <cit>  is available. all these arrays can be used to estimate copy number changes from probe intensities, determine snp genotypes by allele-specific hybridization, confirm loss of heterozygosity, detect uniparental disomy, identify non-paternity and determine haplotypes and parental origin of cnvs.

a number of software packages are available for analysis of oligonucleotide arrays  <cit> . three software packages, listed in table  <dig>  are currently in common use for copy number analysis of affymetrix  <dig> k snp wgsa data: copy number analyser for genechip® arrays   <cit> , dna-chip analyzer   <cit>  and affymetrix genechip® chromosome copy number analysis tool   <cit> . all of these software packages perform normalization, scaling and feature extraction of signal intensities, and enable detection of copy number alterations, but each package uses a different algorithm for these functions. briefly, cnag normalizes and scales the test sample against a "best-fit" user-defined reference set and corrects the signal intensity ratios for the differences in pcr product length and gc content. after feature extraction a hidden markov model  algorithm is applied to infer copy numbers along each chromosome  <cit> . dchip normalizes and scales data within and between chips using a procedure established for affymetrix genechip® arrays  <cit> , and then compares the test sample to a user-defined reference set of samples to estimate copy numbers in the test sample. this output is then used by an hmm to infer copy numbers  <cit> . cnat compares a test sample to a reference set of  <dig> samples provided by affymetrix  <cit>  or to a user-defined reference set to estimate the copy number of each snp locus, and then applies a kernel smoothing algorithm to identify the regions of copy number alteration  <cit> . the relative performance of these methods in performing high throughput oligonucleotide array normalization, scaling and feature extraction and their performance in the sensitivity or specificity of cnv detection have not previously been reported, nor have the effects of different reference sets on cnv discovery. accordingly, in this study we compared the performance of cnag, dchip and cnat software  using synthetic data and an empirical data set that contains cnvs validated predominantly by fluorescent in situ hybridization . we report assessment of the normalization, scaling and feature extraction algorithms of these packages, as well as assessment of the approaches used for identification of cnvs and their boundaries. in addition, we tested the impact of reference set size and composition on cnv detection with each software package. finally, we estimated the true and false positive detection rates of these various approaches for the identification of genomic gains or losses.

RESULTS
the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of various software packages and the effect of different reference sets on identification of cnvs in affymetrix  <dig> k snp array data. we performed the evaluations described here using a synthetic data set and an empirical data set that we generated from  <dig> individuals . the sample set was derived from  <dig> patients with mental retardation  and their unaffected mothers and fathers, as well as  <dig> unaffected siblings of the patients. several of the individuals studied have cnvs that were validated using independent methods  <cit> .

we performed  <dig> k snp wgsa experiments using  <dig> arrays of which  <dig> were xba  <dig> k chips and  <dig> were hind  <dig> k chips . from individual oligonucleotide probe intensities, we determined the snp genotypes  and performed initial copy number analysis using each of the software packages listed in table  <dig>  of the software packages we analyzed, only those developed for affymetrix genechip mapping  <dig> k arrays are capable of normalization, scaling and feature extraction of affymetrix data . hence, we used cnag, dchip or cnat to perform this procedure on our array data.

cnag and dchip use hmm-based algorithms to detect regions of genomic gains and losses and estimate their boundaries . cnat provides plots of copy number and associated p-values along each chromosome, but does not report cnvs or their boundaries. for the estimation of cnvs and their breakpoints, we evaluated the utility of cnag, dchip and glad  <cit> , the latter developed originally for array-cgh data analysis .

detection of candidate copy number variants from synthetic data
as an initial assessment of the software packages, we constructed a synthetic data set in which we purposely introduced artificial cnvs, and then measured cnv detection performance, including true and false positive detection rates, of the software approaches.

our data set contained  <dig> artificial normalized array results produced from a normal individual's genome and subsequent comparison to a reference set of  <dig> individuals . normalization was performed using cnag, dchip and cnat for these synthetic array results . we then introduced  <dig> simulated cnvs into each of the  <dig> synthetic samples with probe set widths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and copy numbers ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . detection of cnvs in these normalized data was then performed using dchip and glad . cnv detection could not be performed using cnag, because this software does not accept intermediate stage normalized data as input.

the total numbers of putative cnvs detected from the synthetic arrays, and assessments of false positive and false negative rates are shown in table  <dig>  none of the software detected all true cnvs as the true positive rates fell between  <dig>   and  <dig>  . all of the approaches had false discovery rates ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . we observed generally superior performance in the detection of deletions compared to the detection of duplications. we found that dchip analysis of the synthetic data resulted in the identification of the largest number of putative cnvs but yielded fairly low true positive rates  and the highest false discovery rates  . in this analysis the cnag-glad approach showed the best overall true positive rates  and lowest false discovery rates .

awhere two software packages are listed, the first one was used for normalization and the second for cnv detection.

detection of candidate copy number variants from empirical data
to assess the performance of the software approaches on empirical data, we next analyzed  <dig> affymetrix snp arrays, employing five approaches that in total used four software packages . to detect regions of genomic gains and losses after normalization, scaling and feature extraction by cnag, dchip or cnat, we applied the hmm algorithms of cnag and dchip, as well as the adaptive weights smoothing  algorithm of glad . due to the difference in normal x chromosome copy numbers between males and females, detection of x chromosome cnvs requires more complex approaches than autosomal cnvs, and not all of the software packages tested here were able to score genomic copy number along the sex chromosomes. hence, we focused on copy number assessment of autosomal regions. to identify a candidate cnv, we arbitrarily imposed a requirement for at least four adjacent snps that demonstrated a similar apparent gain or loss of copy number.

to determine the effect of reference set size and composition on cnv detection, we used four reference sets in our analyses . the algorithmic differences between cnat, dchip and cnag impose different requirements with regards to the size range of the reference set used. however, by default, all of the software packages we used assume that the reference set has a mean copy number of  <dig>  at all autosomal locations. a large reference set would usually satisfy this assumption because, in such a set, rare polymorphic cnvs will have negligible effects. a large reference set also provides the advantage of reducing noise arising from the comparison. however, common polymorphic cnvs in the reference sets could still affect the results.

pair wise comparisons of one sample to another can only be performed with cnag  <cit> . this may be useful in the case of parent-offspring "trio" analyses, such as reported in  <cit> . direct comparison of array data derived from a child to data derived from the parents is the most straight-forward means of distinguishing de novo mutations from inherited cnvs, and the boundaries of inherited aberrations should usually be the same in the parent and child. thus, we tested cnag, as well as cnag normalization, scaling and feature extraction combined with glad cnv detection  using three pair-wise comparisons within each trio – child to father, child to mother, and father to mother . we refer to this analysis within trios as a "reference set of 2".

dchip and cnat require the use of larger reference sets: the minimum sizes required are  <dig> for dchip  <cit>  and  <dig> for cnat  <cit> . so that one consistent reference set could be used to compare the performance of all three software packages, we chose a reference set of  <dig> unaffected mothers of children with mr . these  <dig> mothers chosen were those with the fewest candidate cnvs identified by dchip, compared to the other mothers in our data set . with dchip and cnat, it is possible to increase the size of the reference set further, so we tested whether this would be advantageous. for this purpose, we assembled a reference set of  <dig> unaffected parents of children with mr . for cnat, there is a default reference set of  <dig> individuals provided by affymetrix, which was also evaluated .

the lists of candidate cnvs and their boundaries identified in the  <dig> samples by cnag using reference sets of  <dig> and  <dig> individuals are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the cnvs detected with the cnag-glad approach are listed in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . putative cnvs found with dchip are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . cnvs detected by glad from the feature extracted data by dchip  are shown in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . candidate cnvs identified using glad from snp copy number log2-ratios calculated by cnat  are listed in additional file  <dig> , additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> .

the types of candidate cnvs detected also varied greatly among the  <dig> approaches. duplications accounted for between 2% and 89% of all cnvs . the lowest proportion of duplications, and thus the highest proportion of deletions, was identified by dchip-glad. the three highest proportions of duplications and lowest proportions of deletions were detected by dchip with the reference sets of  <dig> and  <dig>  and by cnag with the reference set of  <dig> .

for three hind and two xba arrays, each from a different sample, candidate cnvs were not detected by any approach. data from  <dig> hind and  <dig> xba chips predicted  <dig> or more putative cnvs by at least one method. however, none of the arrays had  <dig> or more aberrations detected by all of the  <dig> approaches.

false positive rate
the ultimate approach to determining the false positive rate of each copy number analysis method would be to attempt validation of each candidate cnv using an independent method. a subset of putative cnvs was confirmed using fish   <cit> , but it was not feasible to do this for all of the many thousands of candidate cnvs detected in this study .

bthe method of validation for each cnv is shown in additional file  <dig> 

to obtain an estimate of false positive rates among a larger number of candidate deletions, we used the snp genotype data, assuming that deletions  should not contain heterozygous genotype calls . the average proportion of false positive deletions identified by snp heterozygosity was 40%, ranging from 23% to 67% in the xba data, and between 25% and 66% in the hind data . in both array types, the cnag-glad combination with the reference set of  <dig> exhibited the lowest false positive deletion rate, and cnag with a reference set of size  <dig> produced the highest. we note that these false positive rates are likely underestimates, especially for short cnvs, because stretches of homozygous snps could also occur by chance in regions with normal copy number.

the software packages tested here apply different algorithms and statistics for cnv detection. we examined the distribution of snp copy numbers and found that they showed the characteristics of a gaussian distribution. thus, to assess and compare the significance of cnvs detected by these different approaches, we performed a t-test as follows. first, we calculated the log2-ratios of test sample copy numbers versus reference copy numbers for each snp. next we calculated the mean and standard deviation  of these log2-ratios within each candidate cnv, and also for the rest of the same chromosome excluding the region affected by the cnv. we then compared these values using a t-test, and obtained the corresponding p-values . we then filtered the candidate cnvs using an uncorrected p <=  <dig>  cutoff along with arbitrary copy number value thresholds of < <dig>  for deletions and > <dig>  for duplications. the candidate cnvs that passed these thresholds are summarized in table  <dig>  as expected, application of these cutoff values resulted in fewer cnvs and also reduced the false positive deletion rates in most instances. however, the false positive deletion call rates remained substantial, averaging 32%. lower p-value thresholds further reduced the numbers of candidate cnvs, as expected . however, substantial rates of false positive deletions still remained even with a p <=  <dig>  cutoff, with an average false positive deletion rate of 28%.

to assess how detection and false positive rates were affected by the number of snps included in candidate cnvs, we counted the number of candidates that included at least  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> snps . we also calculated false positive deletion rates on the basis of snp heterozygosity at each level and applied p-value and copy number thresholds as described above . we note that the rate of false positive deletion calls in the smallest size class  may be unrealistically low in our analysis, because homozygosity is more likely to occur by chance over a few adjacent snps than over many. however, there was a high number of cnvs that passed our p-value  and copy number  thresholds and that were predicted by <=  <dig> snps, indicating that many of the putative cnvs in this small size range may be real. interestingly, the false positive call rate was often relatively high and the percentage of cnvs that passed the p-value and copy number thresholds was often relatively low in the largest cnv size class  compared to the other categories . the majority of false positive cnvs in this size range exhibited copy numbers that averaged only a little more or less than  <dig> , but the change may have appeared significant because of the large number of snps involved.

candidate cnvs predicted by multiple methods
putative cnv regions identified by at least two software/reference set combinations from xba or hind data or both from the same sample are presented in additional file  <dig>  these regions were predicted by the software platforms without applying additional filters based on p-value or copy number thresholds. because distinct approaches and the two different chips in the  <dig> k set often detect slightly different boundaries for a particular cnv, we defined mutually predicted cnvs in this analysis as those sharing at least 50% of the base pairs within a genomic segment defined by the snps included in the deletion or duplication.

mutually predicted candidate cnvs consisting of fewer than  <dig> consecutive snps are listed in additional file 14a. in this size range, a total of  <dig>  putative cnvs consisting of  <dig>  duplications  and  <dig>  deletions  were detected in our sample set of  <dig> individuals using two or more methods.  <dig>   of these putative  <dig>  cnvs  were detected by  <dig> distinct software/reference set combinations,  <dig>  by  <dig> or  <dig>  and  <dig>  by  <dig> or more approaches.  <dig>  of the candidate deletions predicted by more than one approach  were considered to be false positive calls on the basis of snp heterozygosity .

mutually predicted putative cnvs of  <dig> or more consecutive snps are listed in additional file 14b. a total of  <dig>  such candidate cnvs were identified by at least two methods, including  <dig> duplications  and  <dig> deletions . of these larger cnvs,  <dig>  were identified by  <dig> distinct software/reference set combinations,  <dig>  by  <dig> or  <dig>  and  <dig>  via  <dig> or more approaches.  <dig>  deletions predicted by more than one approach were considered to be false positive calls on the basis of snp heterozygosity . we validated  <dig> of the remaining candidate deletions using fish ; the fourth one was not tested.

rate of detection of confirmed cnvs
to determine the detection rate of real cnvs by each of the software/reference set combinations, we assessed  <dig> cnvs  that were confirmed by independent experimental approaches   <cit> . some of these were inherited cnvs that had been demonstrated in both the child and a parent of one mr family. other confirmed cnvs occurred de novo in a child with mr and were shown not to be present in either parent. snp genotypes were used to confirm paternity in all cases.

the confirmed deletions in this set all had a copy number of  <dig> in the involved genomic region, and the confirmed duplications all had a copy number of  <dig>  deletions of ~ <dig> kb or larger were identified by most or all  of the  <dig> software/reference set combinations used. as expected, detection rates were lower for smaller deletions . successful detection of duplications had lower rates overall . surprisingly, a rather large  <dig>  mb duplication was detected by only  <dig> of the  <dig> software/reference set combinations . within this genomic segment, the average distance between snps was ~ <dig> kb , which is substantially greater than the  <dig>  kb average distance between snps across the whole genome in the  <dig> k array set  <cit> .

no single method identified all  <dig> of the confirmed cnvs. cnag-glad with the reference set of  <dig> and cnat-glad with the reference set of  <dig> had the highest rates for detection, identifying  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> confirmed cnvs, respectively . two large deletions were divided by dchip and the cnag-glad combined approach into multiple smaller deletions , instead of the single cnvs predicted by alternate approaches .

candidate cnvs per individual
to estimate the average number of cnvs per genome in our sample set, we chose a combination of three copy number analysis approaches that resulted in optimal true positive detection rate: cnag-glad with the reference set of  <dig>  dchip with the reference set of  <dig> and cnat-glad with the reference set of  <dig>  these three methods together detected all of the  <dig> confirmed cnvs in this study . we generated a list of candidate cnvs that were identified by at least one of these three approaches, from at least one array . to reduce the false positive detection rate, we eliminated all of the putative aberrations that did not meet the following criteria: p <=  <dig>  ; and copy number <=  <dig>   or >=  <dig>  . deletions considered false positive based on snp heterozygosity were also eliminated. we then calculated the average numbers of remaining candidate cnvs per individual in the  <dig> children with mr, and in the  <dig> unaffected parents and siblings of the affected children.

in the  <dig> unaffected individuals we found an average of  <dig> candidate cnvs per genome, consisting of  <dig> deletions and  <dig> duplications. the average size of the deletions was  <dig> kb , and the average size of the duplications was  <dig> kb . in the affected children, the average number of candidate cnvs was  <dig>  including  <dig> deletions and  <dig> duplications. the average size of the deletions was  <dig> kb , and the average size of the duplications was  <dig> kb .

theoretical resolving power
the ability to estimate genomic gains and losses and to define their boundaries is dependent on the normalization, scaling and feature extraction of the raw intensity data. more effective normalization and feature extraction yields higher signal-to-noise ratios, which enable superior detection of regions with altered copy numbers. using snp copy number data from the  <dig> validated deletions and  <dig> confirmed duplications listed in table  <dig>  we calculated theoretical resolving powers of the normalization, scaling and feature extraction algorithms used by cnag, dchip and cnat with the various reference sets described above . we defined the resolving power as the average size of the smallest single copy deletion or duplication that could be detected at a given confidence level. mean test versus reference snp copy number log2-ratios were calculated from the data following feature extraction, and they showed the characteristics of a gaussian distribution. the welch t-test was then computed to compare mean snp copy number ratios within a given cnv against the rest of the chromosome . for this calculation, we assumed that snps were uniformly distributed throughout the genome. we then estimated the p-values that would be obtained for hemizygous deletions  and single copy duplications  containing increasing numbers of adjacent snps using the means and standard deviations obtained from  <dig> confirmed deletions and  <dig> confirmed duplications . in genomic regions where the snp density is higher or lower than average, corresponding p-values would be lower or higher than those presented in figure  <dig>  but variation in snp density would affect the p-values across all of the methods similarly. therefore, even though absolute p-values change with snp density, the relative p-values presented here provide a valid comparison.

the resolving power calculated from the weighted average of the  <dig> validated deletions  is shown in figure 3a. the resolving power calculated from the weighted average of the  <dig> confirmed duplications  is shown in figure 3b. we observed that the affymetrix mapping  <dig> k xbai and hindiii assays had similar resolving powers, so we combined the xba and hind data for these analyses.

dchip normalization, scaling and feature extraction provided the highest resolving power for the deletions, with negligible difference between the reference sets of  <dig> and  <dig> . this result indicates that for any given p-value cutoff, on average one would expect to be able to detect the smallest one-copy deletions with dchip feature extraction and our reference set of  <dig> or  <dig>  most other methods showed only slightly decreased resolving power. reference set selection had little effect on resolving power in most cases, although cnat with the affymetrix default reference set of  <dig> ranked the lowest .

reference set selection had a greater effect on the resolving power for duplications, and the reference sets chosen from our own data set resulted in higher resolving power than the affymetrix default set of  <dig> individuals . we note that our estimation of the resolving power was probably less accurate for duplications than deletions, since we had a smaller number of confirmed aberrations available for our analysis. nevertheless, the resolving power was clearly better for deletions than for duplications, such that deletions of a given size could be detected with higher confidence than duplications of the same size.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that cnag, dchip, cnat and glad were suitable for high-throughput processing of affymetrix  <dig> k snp array data for copy number analysis. various reference sets selected from data produced by our research team resulted in superior feature extraction, higher signal-to-noise ratios, and higher rates of detection of confirmed cnvs than the external default reference set provided by affymetrix. this difference may be due to experimental variation between different laboratories, to differences in the frequencies of snp genotypes and copy number polymorphisms  in ethnically diverse populations, or to other unidentified factors. therefore, we recommend using a reference set, processed in the same laboratory and ideally from samples with a similar ethnic composition to the sample set.

we found considerable variation in the numbers of putative cnvs detected by various software/reference set combinations, and more cnvs were called by dchip than by any other software tested. rates of false positive deletion calls identified by snp heterozygosity were substantial with all of the approaches tested, and the false positive call rates did not correlate with the total number of candidate cnvs identified by a given approach. the highest rate of false positive candidate deletion calls was produced by cnag using a reference set of  <dig> , but this is likely, at least in part, due to the very small size of the reference set combined with noisy data. in such a small reference set, the average copy number may be quite different from  <dig>  in certain regions of the genome. for example, similar results are expected using pair-wise test versus reference comparisons for the very different cases of a paternally inherited deletion  and a duplication in the mother that was not inherited  . in such cases, we accepted all possible cnvs as candidates for optimal sensitivity , but we expected that a subset of these cnvs would be false positives.

within a large reference set, the average copy number of all loci is more likely to be close to  <dig> , which improves the confidence of cnv detection in a given sample. however, frequent polymorphisms in a large reference set may skew the results. for example, a deletion affecting a single genomic region occurring in 10% of the population could decrease the mean of copy number in that region to  <dig>  in a large random reference set, while a deletion with 50% frequency may push the base line to  <dig> , resulting in a false positive duplication call in a test sample that lacks the aberration or a false negative deletion call in a test sample that has the deletion. data from a chromosomal region rich in polymorphic sites might seem noisy and might not yield distinguishable cnvs even though they are frequent. further understanding of cnvs and their frequencies in the general population will help resolve this issue and increase specificity of cnv detection in these regions.

the performance of software packages in the detection of single copy deletions was better than that of single copy duplications. this may be due to the fact that deletions produce a 2-fold change in copy number , while duplications produce only a  <dig> -fold change .

the rate of detection of confirmed cnvs  was independent of the total numbers of cnvs reported  by a particular software/reference set combination. as expected, larger cnvs were detected more consistently than smaller ones, and the denser the snp coverage within a given chromosomal segment, the smaller the cnvs  that could be detected with high confidence. we found that cnag-glad using pair wise comparisons within trios  detected the largest proportion  of the  <dig> validated aberrations, closely followed by cnat-glad with the reference set of  <dig>  . unfortunately, these two approaches also had the highest false positive deletion rates, of 66% and 51%, respectively . no single method detected all of the confirmed cnvs, and each method missed a different subset of variants. thus, none of the software/reference set combinations we tested appears to be sufficient to detect all true cnvs, and several approaches may need to be used together for efficient and reliable copy number analysis of genechip snp data. for example, to maximize the detection rate of true positive cnvs we recommend using the combination of cnag-glad with pair-wise comparisons of test and reference samples, and the use of dchip and cnat-glad with large reference sets . this combination of approaches successfully detected all of the validated cnvs in our study. to reduce false positive rates, we recommend snp genotype analysis of putative deletions  and setting thresholds for statistical significance and copy number values of putative cnvs.

we used the default parameter settings for copy number analysis in each of the software packages evaluated in this study, as would most users. we did not attempt a thorough parameter optimization due to the large size of the data set and the number of other variables under which the software packages were tested. it should be noted though that changing parameters for some of these software packages may result in different numbers of putative cnvs detected, and the optimal parameters for detection of specific cnvs may also depend on the noise level of each chip and the location and size of the cnvs. among the packages that we evaluated, there are no applicable parameter settings to cnat  <cit> , and we used cnat only for normalization and feature extraction, not for cnv detection. dchip automatically determines its optimal hmm parameters for each chip from the raw data  <cit> , thus these parameters are not user accessible. glad has a few adjustable parameters for aws, such as the lambda value for the number of breakpoints and a clustering parameter lambda  <cit> . we have examined the sensitivity of cnv detection to aws parameter change from the default on a small subset of samples, and found that the results did not change, even for the detection of our smallest validated aberrations. cnag's default hmm parameters have been optimized by the software developers to detect full copy number changes  in a mostly diploid sample  <cit> . these parameters are user adjustable, and adjustment is specifically recommended for non-diploid chromosomal regions or detection of mosaic cnvs  . in some cases one may wish to change these parameters to detect as many true cnvs as possible, even though this would also likely produce much higher false positive call rates. in other circumstances, it may be more important to minimize the false positive call rate, even if this means that some real cnvs will be missed. our study used exclusively samples which are predominantly diploid, and so the default parameters appear the most appropriate.

in addition to the results presented from the empirical data set of  <dig> arrays, we have also tested the software on a smaller synthetic data set with a higher number of simulated cnvs. although the numbers of candidate cnvs detected were not directly comparable to those found from empirical data due to the differences between the approaches, the following conclusions were consistent between the empirical and simulation data. software performance in the detection of deletions was generally better than that of duplications. dchip identified the most putative cnvs from both the empirical and synthetic data. however, it did not have the best true positive cnv detection rate and had significant false positive rate in both cases. on the synthetic data the cnag-glad approach yielded the best true positive cnv detection rate.

the availability of both snp genotypes and genomic copy number information from the same data is a particularly useful feature of affymetrix genechip mapping arrays. the copy number analysis algorithms evaluated in this paper all have substantial false positive candidate cnv call rates; however, many putative deletions can be confirmed and a large proportion of false positives can be eliminated without performing further experiments using the genotype information. none of the copy number analysis programs tested here take genotype information into account for identifying candidate deletions, and this would be a useful feature for future implementation. allelic imbalance in heterozygous genotypes could also be used in calling duplications, as it is in the recently described carat algorithm  <cit> .

another recommendation for improvement of the software packages we tested would be to assign statistical significance to each cnv call and then use this information to rank the candidate cnvs. none of the software packages we tested accurately describes the relative quality of their cnv predictions. an independent statistical test, such as the t-test we employed, is necessary to provide confidence in the cnvs identified by various methods. furthermore, it would also be useful to rank candidate cnvs by the deviation of copy number from  <dig> . a researcher could then decide approximately how many false positive calls to tolerate to achieve the desired rate of true cnv detection by setting the corresponding p-value and copy number thresholds appropriately.

using a combination of approaches described above to optimize true positive detection rates and minimize false positive rates, we estimated the average numbers of cnvs per genome in our sample set. the average of  <dig> candidate cnvs in unaffected individuals  may be an overestimate, because a subset of these may still be false positives. these numbers; however, are in a range similar to those estimated by others in the general population using different technologies and analytical approaches, reviewed by  <cit> . many of the cnvs we found in our sample set of  <dig> unaffected individuals probably represent normal polymorphisms, and future studies will characterize these candidate variants in more detail.

in summary, hybridization data obtained from  <dig> k snp wgsa arrays can be used to identify single-copy constitutional cnvs smaller than  <dig> kb. we found that detecting all real cnvs from such data requires multiple computational approaches. the snp genotype information that is available for all samples analyzed with these arrays is useful for recognizing many false positive calls and should be used to improve the specificity of cnv detection. further improvement in the specificity of recognizing true cnvs may be achieved without loss of sensitivity by better use of the information provided by each of the individual 25-mer oligonucleotide probes associated with each snp on the genechip arrays, by taking advantage of the increased resolution of  <dig> k genechip arrays, and by further improving the array design to provide more uniform coverage of the genome.
