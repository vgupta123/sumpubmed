BACKGROUND
studies during the past decade have shown that the product of the gene myostatin   is an inhibitor of muscle development and of the maintenance of muscle mass. mutations in myostatin  <cit>  result in double-muscling  in both cattle and rodents. in cattle, several disruptive myostatin mutations have been identified in different breeds  <cit> . these mutations truncate the protein product resulting in functional inactivation. for example, in the belgian blue breed, an 11-bp deletion  has occurred in the third exon in a region encoding the bioactive domain. similarly, the q204x mutation , which results in a premature stop codon in the n-terminal lap  domain, is frequently found in the charolais breed or in the inra <dig> genotype  <cit> .

myostatin-null mice exhibit enlarged skeletal muscles relative to wild-type littermates because the numbers  and area  of muscle fibers are increased  <cit> . in cattle breeds, double-muscling is primarily due to hyperplasia  <cit>  as early as the fetal period  <cit> . myostatin expression is regulated throughout gestation  <cit> . it was found to be located in the most recently differentiating cells throughout bovine fetal development  <cit> . myostatin may negatively regulate the number of fast-glycolytic  fibers, which is therefore increased in dm muscles at the expense of oxidative fibers  <cit> . furthermore, the properties of dm muscles differ from those of normal ones  owing to lower collagen and intramuscular fat contents  <cit> . in adult muscle, myostatin is specifically expressed in satellite cells and behaves as an important regulator of satellite cell activation and renewal, thereby controlling muscle mass .

examination of the molecular action of myostatin has revealed that it inhibits the proliferation of myogenic cells through the control of cell cycle progression  <cit> . this provides an explanation for the higher proliferation rates of dm fetal myoblasts than controls in vitro  <cit> . myostatin also protects myoblasts from apoptosis and delays their terminal differentiation  <cit> . functional myostatin binds to the activin type iib transmembrane receptor, which then recruits and activates the alk type i co-receptor by phosphorylation. this results in recruitment of the smad signaling pathway  <cit> . an alternative pathway involving p <dig> mapk signaling has also been proposed to account for growth inhibition  <cit> . the inhibition of myogenesis is mediated partially through a decreased expression of myogenic regulatory factors . myogenin and p21cki have been identified as the major physiological targets of endogenous myostatin in murine cells  <cit> . proteomics has also revealed novel differentially-expressed proteins associated with double-muscling in bull calves  <cit> , suggesting the existence of unidentified myostatin targets.

in order to identify differences in gene expression, and hence novel genes or networks that may be myostatin targets liable to be involved in muscle differentiation, we examined the transcriptional profiling of the semitendinosus  muscle of dm fetuses vs non-double-muscled  at  <dig> days of gestation.

RESULTS
microarray experiments
we performed microarray analyses of the st muscle of dm of the inra <dig> genotype and nm fetuses  using heterologous oligonucleotide chips  dedicated to muscle and cardiac gene expression. the st muscle was chosen since it is highly hypertrophied in dm. the rationale for studying gene expression in late fetuses was that expression of many genes is affected during the last third of gestation  <cit> , a key period in the fiber differentiation/specialization process in cattle, which are mature at birth with regard to muscle physiology  <cit> . the arrays have the advantage of high quality and specificity together with a large number of genes. some 75% of their oligonucleotide sequences are human, which was another advantage for the study since the comparative coverage of the bovine and human genomes is about 91%  <cit> . myostatin expression in st muscle was monitored by quantitative rt-pcr  and was found to be lower in dm than nm muscle. however, it was more elevated in one of the dm foetuses, which was found to be heterozygous for the q204x mutation.

hybridization of bovine targets on to the myochips enabled us to recover 75–84% of valid expression values. examination of microarray data from dm and nm fetuses allowed us to identify major differences in gene expression amongst individuals and genotypes.

hierarchical clustering of the data allowed the genotype groups to be clearly discriminated . however, it revealed a transcriptional profile for the heterozygote dm <dig> fetus more closely related to that of the nm animals . principal component analysis confirmed this finding . thus, muscle gene expression appeared to be altered in fetuses harbouring the q204x mutation. however, this influence differed according to whether one or two impaired myostatin allele were present, illustrating the autosomal recessive character of myostatin in cattle  <cit> , as already shown for muscle protein expression  <cit> .

expression data were filtered for 20% missing values and processed by anova. eight clusters were selected. they included  <dig> genes the expression of which varied according to the presence of one or two functional myostatin allele as shown by the hierarchical clustering. only  <dig> of them had a go annotation. some of these could be potential candidate targets of functional myostatin. twelve were also found to be differentially expressed postnatally in the st muscle of dm vs nm cows . using fatigo+, an evolution of fatigo, we searched for go functional annotation and the kegg pathway. some genes were annotated for carbohydrate metabolism , for lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism , or for protein metabolism and modification . interestingly, these putative myostatin targets were predicted to belong to  <dig> different kegg pathways  such as focal adhesion, axon guidance, calcium signaling pathway, cell cycle, or lastly wnt signaling, which was recently shown to be altered in myostatin knocknull-out mice  <cit> .

differentially expressed genes according to myostatin loss-of-function
using sam, a differential analysis of the hybridization data was carried out between the two groups of three fetuses . it was also performed between two groups of two extreme fetuses  to maximize the difference between the two genotypes . the latter analysis was chosen in order to identify true differentially expressed genes with confidence. analyses allowed a false discovery rate  that accepts that 5‰ of the genes declared differentially expressed will be false positives. in both analyses, a substantial number of genes were differentially expressed and this number varied according to the fold change value . more than 93% of the genes identified from dataset  <dig> were declared to be differentially expressed from dataset  <dig> . taking a fc ≥  <dig>  the same genes were identified in both datasets. however, dataset  <dig> allowed an additional  <dig> down- and  <dig> up-regulated genes to be identified with a fc ≥  <dig>  . the rationale for taking differential expression with a fc ≥  <dig>  and fdr < 5‰ into account was to ensure that greater numbers of differential genes were retained with high confidence, using  <dig> technical replications per animal.

examples of genes declared differential by sam from dataset  <dig> are presented in table  <dig>  and table  <dig> . anova confirmed that the expression of 93% of these genes was statistically significant . the genes with fc ≥  <dig> had p-values < 5‰ by anova, except one . some differential expressions were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr . a search for homology between the oligonucleotides representing differential genes with a fc =  <dig>  and the bovine genome was carried out using blastn and blastx searches. more than 80% of the oligonucleotides were found to have a homology greater than 70% with bovine sequences . these data confirmed the appropriateness of the oligochips even though they were made of human and murine oligonucleotide sequences.

function of differential genes in dm and biological relevance
the data were further explored using gene ontology  information . this predicted that  <dig> of the down-regulated genes with go annotations encoded mainly ribosomal proteins, ecm/cell interaction proteins or sarcomeric slow contractile proteins. conversely, the genes up-regulated in dm muscle were annoted for regulation of the cell cycle, transcription and dna metabolism. only  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated genes had a go annotation at the biological process level. of these,  <dig> were annotated for "regulation of transcription", of which  <dig> were annotated with the go term "transcription factor". they included regulators of muscle-specific gene expression such as mef2a, id <dig> or zfx1b  and also myod <dig> for which the fc  was just under our fc threshold .

some down-regulated genes were found to belong to kegg pathways , e.g. the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and atp synthesis, calcium signaling pathway and extracellular matrix /receptor interaction. up-regulated genes were mainly involved in the insulin pathway, cytokine/receptor interaction, wnt signaling, cell cycle, apoptosis and axon guidance . altogether, these results indicated that myostatin loss-of-function was associated with the alteration of many biological pathways in dm muscle.

genes involved in protein metabolism
one notable finding of our study was that an important subset of the differential genes was involved in protein metabolism or encoded ribosomal proteins. interestingly, some authors have specifically looked for genes that are differentially regulated in early dm embryos compared to normal ones  <cit> . as in the present study, they identified differential expression of ribosomal proteins, suggesting that nm and dm animals may differ in protein degradation and synthesis.

genes involved in contractile and metabolic function
the functional categories of the genes down-regulated in dm illustrate the so-called phenotypic muscle characteristics of these animals. first, the findings highlighted a marked down-regulation of genes encoding slow contractile proteins in fibers , slow twitch proteins  and mb , the differential expression of some of these genes being confirmed by real-time rt-pcr . the bibliosphere pathway edition web tool of the genomatix suite predicted that, in rodents or humans, some of the down-regulated genes  had an nfkb <dig> site in their promoter. interestingly, the nfkb <dig> gene was found to be up-regulated in dm , suggesting that nfkb <dig> expression could contribute to negative regulation of their expression as already shown for collagen col1a <dig>  <cit> . other genes involved in contraction  were also predicted to be targets of tef- <dig> at mef <dig> elements during fast-to-slow muscle conversion, as reported for humans  <cit> .

conversely, the study also showed up-regulation of slc16a <dig> , which encodes a transporter catalyzing the transport of many monocarboxylates including lactate and pyruvate  <cit> , and of ldh-a, which encodes lactate dehydrogenase, although with an fc below our threshold . moreover, it confirmed that the expression of mybp-h, which encodes a component of the thick filaments in fast skeletal muscles, was up-regulated  in the st muscle of dm fetuses, as shown postnatally by proteomic approaches  <cit> . all in all, these data indicated that dm muscles were shifted towards a more glycolytic fast metabolism. a similar observation was reported in myostatin-null mice  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that the muscles of dm cattle contain a higher proportion of fast glycolytic iix fibers and a lower proportion of slow i fibers than nm muscles as early as late gestation  <cit> . proteomics showed increased expression of fast proteins and lowered expression of slow proteins in the st muscle of dm bull calves  <cit> . accordingly, our study revealed gene expression profiles that may be molecular signatures of the dm fast-type phenotype. such features are likely to originate from a high proportion in the secondary generation of muscle fibers following the loss of myostatin function, as early as day  <dig> of fetal age in cattle  <cit> .

ecm-specific genes
it is notable that genes encoding ecm/cell interaction proteins, e.g. col1a <dig>  col1a <dig> and col3a <dig> , fn <dig> , lamb <dig> , and bgn  are down-regulated in dm muscles. ecm has a profound influence on the differentiation of muscle cells and can regulate growth factor function in skeletal muscle . our data are in accordance with the reduced connective tissue content in dm muscles  <cit>  and the decreased expression in dm fetal muscles of the major collagen isoforms, namely the type i and iii collagens, as shown by in situ experiments  <cit> . conversely, a novel result of the present study was the up-regulation of genes encoding type iv collagen, the major structural component of basement membrane surrounding and supporting skeletal muscle cells, and plod <dig>  an enzyme playing an essential role in the supramolecular assembly of collagen iv  <cit> . collagen iv was shown to be located mainly in the endomysium whereas collagen i and iii isoforms are located both in the perimysium and endomysium  <cit> . thus, the ultrastructure of the dm muscle connective tissue could differ from that of nm at both the endomysium and the perimysium levels.

gene marker of adipocyte differentiation
lastly, the most novel and interesting result of our study is the down-regulated expression of c1qtnf <dig> , the differential expression of which was confirmed by rt-pcr . this gene encodes an adipocyte differentiation marker with striking homologies with adiponectin  <cit> . similarly, decreased c1qtnf <dig> expression was detected in dm cows . the finding that a loss-of-function mutation of myostatin is associated with decreased adipocyte differentiation is consistent with the low fat depots in myostatin-null mice  <cit>  and in dm cattle  <cit> . recently, myostatin has been shown to promote the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to the adipogenic lineage  <cit> . potts et al.  <cit>  have also reported decreased expression of hmga <dig>  a transcription factor involved in fat cell proliferation, in dm cattle embryos. the expression of another adipocyte differentiation marker  was found to be lower in the muscles of dm belgian blue bulls compared to bulls with no myostatin mutation  <cit> , illustrating a reduction in intramuscular adipocyte numbers. since the number of intramuscular adipocytes is a major factor in determining muscle marbling of beef  <cit> , it could partly explain the lower intramuscular fat development of dm muscles  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, transcriptomic analysis enabled us to demonstrate that the biological traits of dm muscles are associated with specific gene profiles at the time of fiber differentiation and/or specialization in late fetuses. on the one hand, our results confirm previous data obtained postnatally by classical biochemical and molecular biological approaches. on the other hand, they reveal altered gene expression in the three major muscle compartments, namely fibers, connective tissue and intramuscular adipose tissue. this may help us to understand how myostatin loss-of-function affects so many qualitative properties of muscles. lastly, this study revealed novel putative myostatin targets, e.g. ecm constituents such as type iv collagen, c1qtnf <dig> mainly associated with adipose tissue development, and genes encoding transcription factors . work is in progress to determine whether these genes are direct or indirect targets targets of myostatin throught the examination of putative gene networks.
