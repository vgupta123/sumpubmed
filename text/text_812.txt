BACKGROUND
ethylene plays important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development, including fruit ripening, senescence and pathogen responses, and nodulation in medicago  <cit> . ethylene induces the expression of sub1a or snorkel1/snorkel <dig> in certain rice cultivars, allowing them to survive flooding by various mechanisms  <cit> . arabidopsis has been used as a model plant for the study of ethylene signal transduction for the past two decades. air-grown, etiolated arabidopsis seedlings have a long seedling hypocotyl and primary root. in the presence of ethylene, seedling growth is substantially inhibited, and the hypocotyl and primary root become shorter. in addition, ethylene treatment induces the apical hook formation that is caused by exaggerated curvature at the apical region  <cit> . in the adult stage, ethylene treatment inhibits rosette leaf growth. mutants defective in multiple ethylene receptors or in constitutive triple-response <dig> , a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase  protein acting directly downstream of the receptors, display a constitutive ethylene response phenotype with substantially inhibited rosette leaf growth  <cit> . when grown under light without exogenous sucrose, mutants displaying a constitutive ethylene response phenotype have small and compact cotyledons and the seedling hypocotyl and primary root are shorter than wild type  <cit> . the hypocotyl length of etiolated seedlings, growth of light-grown seedlings, and adult rosette phenotype can be used to score for ethylene responses in arabidopsis  <cit> .

arabidopsis has five ethylene receptors, which are structurally similar to the his-kinase proteins that are prevalently found in two-component modules in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes  <cit> . the five ethylene receptors are structurally distinct and can be classified into two subfamilies. etr <dig> and ers <dig> are in subfamily i, and etr <dig>  ein <dig>  and ers <dig> are in subfamily ii. subfamily i receptors have three putative transmembrane domains and a his-kinase domain, which has the signature motifs essential to his-kinase activity. subfamily ii receptors have three or four putative transmembrane domains, depending on the algorithms used for topological prediction, and a non-conserved his-kinase domain, in which some consensus amino acid residues essential for his-kinase activity are lacking  <cit> .

biochemical studies indicate that etr <dig> has his-kinase activity and all subfamily ii receptors have ser/thr kinase activity. ers <dig> has both his-kinase and ser/thr kinase activities. ers <dig> is believed to possess ser/thr kinase activity because histidine autophosphorylation is lost when ers <dig> is assayed in the presence of both mg2+and mn2+  <cit> . mutants lacking both etr <dig> and ers <dig> display extremely strong ethylene growth inhibition, implying unique roles of subfamily i members in the ethylene signaling  <cit> . expression of the kinase-dead etr <dig>  isoform is able to reverse the etr1- <dig> ers1- <dig> growth inhibition, indicating that his-kinase activity is not essential to etr <dig> receptor signaling  <cit> . in addition, expression of the truncated etr <dig> fragment substantially reverses the etr1- <dig> ers1- <dig> mutant phenotype, suggesting that wild-type etr <dig> receptor signaling can be mediated through the n terminus, possibly via the gaf domain  <cit> .

some ethylene receptors can be regulated at transcriptional and/or translational levels in arabidopsis. expression of tap-tagged receptors suggests a correlation of receptor protein amount and transcript level in air-grown arabidopsis  <cit> . ethylene treatment or receptor gene mutations do not alter etr <dig> protein or etr <dig> transcript levels  <cit> . expression of ers <dig>  ers <dig> and etr <dig> can be induced by ethylene treatment  <cit> . etr <dig> protein accumulates at a high ethylene concentration  and undergoes protein degradation when ethylene concentration exceeds  <dig> μl l- <dig>  <cit> . the ethylene-binding test, at a very low ethylene concentration , suggests that receptor amount is relevant to receptor gene expression level, and that up-regulation of remaining receptors in a receptor mutant does not functionally compensate for the defective ones  <cit> . the etr1- <dig> ers1- <dig> mutant displays extremely strong growth inhibition; ectopic expression of any of the subfamily ii receptors cannot reverse the mutant phenotype  <cit> . together, these studies suggest that ethylene receptors may act synergistically and are not functionally replaceable by other receptors.

as single ethylene mutants do not display a visibly prominent phenotype, ethylene receptor function is inferred from phenotypes of mutants defective in multiple receptors  <cit> . to infer the functions of the single receptor genes etr <dig> and ers <dig>  we characterized the ethylene response phenotype in ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> and etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  effects of the respective loss of etr <dig> and ers <dig> on ethylene response phenotypes were also reciprocally examined. we found that ers <dig> can promote ethylene responses in the presence of etr <dig>  the possibility that ecotype mixture might alleviate growth inhibition was not favored. because ers <dig> is also able to repress ethylene responses  <cit> , we hypothesized that ers <dig> has dual roles in the regulation of ethylene signaling.

RESULTS
ethylene response phenotype in ethylene receptor mutants
dark-grown wild-type seedlings have a long hypocotyl when germinated in air. ethylene treatment inhibits the hypocotyl elongation, and mutants defective in multiple ethylene receptor genes display various degrees of hypocotyl growth inhibition  <cit> . in this study, seedling hypocotyl length was measured to evaluate effects of the respective loss of etr <dig> and ers <dig> on the ethylene response. if not specified, ers <dig> refers to the ers1- <dig> allele, and loss-of-function receptor mutants were studied throughout this work.

in all receptor mutant sets examined, the addition of the etr1- <dig> null mutation resulted in hypocotyl growth inhibition, while the addition of the ers1- <dig> loss-of-function mutation resulted in hypocotyl growth recovery . in addition to the dark-grown triple-response phenotype, the phenotype of light-grown seedlings was examined. the wild-type seedlings had a long primary root and fully extended cotyledons when grown under light. mutants lacking multiple receptors displayed various degrees of growth inhibition. in several receptor knockout combinations, the addition of ers1- <dig> resulted in growth recovery while the addition of etr1- <dig> caused growth inhibition. among those mutants, etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> displayed the strongest growth inhibition; in contrast, growth inhibition was minor in  ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> .

our results implied that ers <dig> has positive effects on ethylene responses, in contrast to previous studies showing that ers <dig> can inhibit ethylene responses  <cit> . however, endogenous ethylene production may affect the analyses. avg glycine) is an effective ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor and reduces ethylene production from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nl  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nl  in etiolated wild-type seedlings  <cit> . in this study, avg was included to eliminate endogenous ethylene production, and the effects of ers <dig> on the seedling triple response were evaluated. consistent with our results, in any etr1-containing receptor mutants, the loss of ers <dig> substantially led to hypocotyl elongation. in contrast, the etr1- <dig> null mutation caused growth inhibition in corresponding ers1-containing mutant sets. etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> displayed a dramatic inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. the growth inhibition in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> was greatly relieved upon the addition of the hypomorphic ers1- <dig> or the amorphic ers1- <dig> allele .

the loss of multiple ethylene receptors leads to dramatic reduction in rosette size, due to the loss of repression in ethylene response by those receptors  <cit> . the rosette phenotype of receptor-deficient mutants was examined to score for ethylene responses. mutants that exhibited inhibition in rosette growth upon the loss of etr <dig> consistently displayed growth recovery upon the loss of ers <dig>  among those mutants,  etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> displayed the strongest growth inhibition, and  ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> had a larger rosette than etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  ers <dig> etr <dig> ers <dig> exhibited early flowering and rosette growth ceased . both the ers <dig> and ers <dig> mutations are from the wassilewskija  ecotype, and the other receptor mutations are from the columbia  ecotype  <cit> . the early-flowering phenotype could be a trait from ws background, because ws exhibited early bolting in our study . effects of the ers <dig> mutation on etr <dig> ers <dig> growth were not determined in this study.

our data show that the addition of the ers <dig> loss-of-function mutation to any etr1-containing receptor mutants alleviates growth inhibition to various degrees. the extent of growth inhibition in mutants lacking etr <dig> or ers <dig> varied, supporting the hypothesis that the receptors function synergistically  <cit> .

receptor gene expression in receptor mutants
studies on ethylene binding  as well as the expression of tap-tagged receptors  indicate that receptor protein levels are correlated with receptor gene expression  <cit> . our genetic analyses indicated that the respective loss of etr <dig> and ers <dig> has an opposite effect on the ethylene response phenotype. to investigate if the loss of ers <dig> results in an increase in total receptor gene expression, and thus alleviates growth inhibition, we estimated the total receptor amount in the receptor mutants by measuring the expression of remaining wild-type receptor genes.

gene expression was measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative rt-pcr . figure 2a shows that in any receptor mutant sets, the loss of ers <dig> resulted in a reduction in total receptor gene expression  in adult rosette leaves. notably, etr <dig> ein <dig> and etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> had a smaller rosette size and higher total receptor gene expression than ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> and ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  respectively . the etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> mutant displayed a constitutive ethylene response phenotype and its relative receptor gene expression was greater than that in wild type . the total receptor gene expression in etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> was statistically identical to that in ers <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig>  ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig>  ers <dig> ers <dig>  and ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> ; however, it had the smallest rosette size .

the relative expression of each remaining receptor gene upon the loss of ers <dig> was analyzed by assigning the corresponding gene expression in the wild-type  rosette the value of  <dig>  in etr <dig> ein <dig>  the relative ers <dig> and etr <dig> expression levels were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and changed to  <dig>  and  <dig>  upon the addition of the ers1- <dig> mutation . the changes did not result in elevation of total receptor gene expression . in addition, ers <dig> expression is ethylene-inducible  <cit>  and our data show that etr <dig> ein <dig> had a higher ers <dig> level than ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig>  these results imply that the ethylene response was stronger in etr <dig> ein <dig> than in ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig>  in agreement with the ethylene growth inhibition phenotype . for the other three mutant sets, the loss of ers <dig> did not result in significant alterations in the expression of the remaining receptor genes . notably, etr <dig> expression in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> was identical to that in ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> and ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> ; the latter two mutants had a larger rosette. the etr <dig> etr <dig> ers <dig> mutant had the same total receptor gene expression levels as col- <dig>  due to elevation in ers <dig> and ein <dig> expression levels .

our results show that the loss of ers <dig> does not result in transcriptional compensation by other receptor genes, and that higher receptor gene expression levels do not necessarily lead to a greater extent of growth recovery. the elevated ers <dig> and ein <dig> expression did not functionally compensate for the etr <dig>  etr <dig>  and ers <dig> mutations. receptor mutants carrying ers <dig> had a higher receptor gene expression than those carrying ers <dig>  largely excluding the possibility of functional compensation at transcriptional or translational levels. the expression of those knockout genes was not measured in this study; the possibility that they may have residual function is very slim due to the nature of their mutations.

effects of ers <dig> alleles on growth recovery in receptor mutants
the above data show that the ers1- <dig> loss-of-function mutation caused growth recovery in receptor mutants. however, the ers1- <dig> mutation is hypomorphic while ers1- <dig> is amorphic  <cit> ; therefore, the allele specificity needed to be examined.

to examine if ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> could result in any significant difference in growth recovery, the mutant phenotypes of ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> were compared throughout developmental stages. they were phenotypically indiscernible , except that the etr <dig> ers1- <dig> double mutant displayed a milder mutant phenotype than etr <dig> ers1- <dig> , as shown in previous studies  <cit> . the hypocotyl lengths of etiolated ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> and ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> were nearly identical when germinated in air or in the presence of avg . because the addition of ers <dig> to etr1- <dig> did not reverse the ethylene growth inhibition , and growth recovery by ers <dig> only occurred in the presence of etr <dig>  the effects on the alleviation of growth inhibition by ers <dig> are etr <dig> dependent. notably, the addition of ers <dig> to etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> also led to growth inhibition in the quintuple receptor knock mutant regardless of avg treatment .

effects of ecotype mixture on growth recovery by ers <dig> mutations
the ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> mutations are in the ws ecotype, while etr <dig>  etr <dig>  and ein <dig> are in the col- <dig> ecotype. in arabidopsis, heterosis may result in an increase of biomass  <cit> ; thus, we needed to exclude the possibility that a mix of the two ecotypes could alter the ethylene response phenotype.

a dose-response curve was drawn to compare ethylene response in col- <dig>  ws, and their f <dig> . these lines exhibited a nearly identical dose-response curve over a wide range of ethylene concentrations ; the seedling hypocotyl lengths of col- <dig> and the f <dig> were statistically identical at the ethylene concentration range of 0- <dig> μl l- <dig> , except that at 10- <dig> μl l- <dig> ethylene the f <dig> seedling was much shorter. additionally, the col- <dig> seedling was only  <dig>  mm longer than the f <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> μl l- <dig> ethylene . these results tell us that the mixture of col- <dig> and ws is not sufficient to significantly reverse ethylene growth inhibition.

ers <dig> is shown to repress ethylene responses  <cit> ; in our study, the loss of ers <dig> reversed ethylene growth inhibition. we examined how the loss of ers <dig> may affect ethylene growth inhibition in wild type . at a low ethylene concentration range , both ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> had a shorter seedling hypocotyl than ws, and the difference was the greatest  at  <dig>  μl l- <dig> ethylene. at a high ethylene concentration range , ethylene growth inhibition in ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> was weaker than in ws . ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> had identical seedling hypocotyl lengths over a wide range of ethylene concentrations , except that ers1- <dig> was shorter  than ers1- <dig> at  <dig>  μl l- <dig> ethylene.

in addition to ers <dig> mutations, ers <dig> is also in the ws ecotype. mutants lacking ers <dig> had a shorter seedling hypocotyl than those carrying ers <dig>  providing evidence that growth recovery in ers1-lacking mutants is not due to ecotype mixture .

possible effects of ecotype mixture on the ethylene response phenotype were reciprocally examined by complementing the ers1- <dig> mutation with ers <dig>  the ers1p:ers <dig> transgene was cloned from col- <dig>  two independent ers1p:ers <dig> ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> transformation lines phenotypically resembled etr <dig> ein <dig>  and exhibited a shorter hypocotyl than ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> .

our results suggest that the repression of growth inhibition upon the loss of ers <dig> is not due to the mix of col- <dig> and ws backgrounds. the ethylene dose-response assay for ers <dig> and ws implies that ers <dig> may repress ethylene growth inhibition at low ethylene concentrations, but promote ethylene responses at high ethylene concentrations in wild type.

ers <dig> overexpression exaggerates growth inhibition in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers2
ers <dig> is essential for repression of the ethylene response in the etr1- <dig> loss-of-function mutant   <cit> . our genetic analysis shows that ers <dig> can elevate ethylene response in receptor mutants carrying etr <dig>  indicating that ers <dig> has dual functions in the regulation of the ethylene response. conceivably, ers <dig> overexpression elevates growth inhibition in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  regardless of the ecotype or ecotype mixture.

to test our hypothesis, ers <dig> was expressed under the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  two classes of phenotype  were typical among the resulting transformed lines. class a phenotypically resembled etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  while class b plants were sterile and the rosette was much smaller. efforts were made to express ers <dig> under an inducible promoter to obtain stable expression lines; however, the resulting siblings of any homozygous transformation lines exhibited various degrees of elevation in growth inhibition, possibly due to unstable expression . we thus examined 35s:ers <dig> transformation lines.

due to infertility, three independent class b lines in the t <dig> generation were characterized. in addition to the extremely small rosette phenotype, in comparison to that of etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  class b lines displayed early leaf senescence , a phenotype of the ethylene response  <cit> . the relative expression level of ers <dig> protein to the rosette phenotype was examined. class a lines exhibited a similar ers <dig> protein level as etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  while class b lines had much higher ers <dig> protein accumulation . expression of ethylene-inducible chib  <cit>  was estimated by qrt-pcr to examine the relationship between ethylene response and rosette phenotype of class b lines. in comparison to wild type, chib expression in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> and the class a lines was elevated to 6-fold, while expression in class b lines was 50- to 70-fold . these results support our genetic analyses and the hypothesis that ers <dig> can negate the repression of the ethylene response by etr <dig>  in addition, these results back the argument that the growth inhibition caused by ers <dig> is not due to ecotype mixture.

we previously showed that rte <dig> is able to elevate etr <dig> signaling  <cit> . we next investigated whether ers <dig> could modulate rte <dig> expression to promote the ethylene response repressed by etr <dig>  when estimated by qrt-pcr, the ers1- <dig> mutation did not significantly increase rte <dig> expression relative to the corresponding ers1-containing mutants . etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> exhibited slightly higher rte <dig> expression than ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> and etr <dig> ein4; two quadruple receptor mutants had similar rte <dig> expression.

seedling hypocotyl growth recovery by ers <dig> is not inhibited by ethylene
ethylene binding is known to inactivate ethylene receptors  <cit> . we investigated whether ethylene binding negates the inhibitory effect of ers <dig> on plant growth.

in an ethylene dose-response assay, three independently obtained isogenic receptor mutant lines lacking ers <dig> had a longer seedling hypocotyl than the corresponding mutants containing ers <dig> . minor variations in the hypocotyl lengths among the three individual lines at low ethylene ranges  did not affect the conclusion that these ers1-lacking mutants had a much longer seedling hypocotyl than the ers1-containing plants. we do not exclude the possibility that the variations could be due to ecotype mixture. ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> was consistently longer than etr <dig> ein <dig> over the same ethylene concentration range, while etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> was the shortest . at a high ethylene concentration , ers1-lacking mutants always had a longer seedling hypocotyl than corresponding ers1-containing mutants. notably, the corresponding etr1-lacking mutants had the shortest seedling hypocotyl in any receptor mutant sets .

ethylene has various effects on the steady-state receptor amount. the etr <dig> receptor amount is unaltered in an array of receptor mutants  <cit>  or by ethylene treatment  <cit> . ein <dig> expression is not ethylene inducible  <cit> . the etr <dig> receptor amount decreases at high ethylene concentrations in hydroponically grown arabidopsis  <cit> . we examined the ers <dig> receptor amount by immunoanalysis and figure 6d shows that ers <dig> accumulation was coupled with an increase in ethylene concentration. these results suggest that the steady-state ers <dig> receptor did not undergo bulk degradation upon ethylene binding. additionally, elevation in ers <dig> protein levels under ethylene treatment may contribute to growth inhibition, explaining why ers <dig> mutants exhibited weaker growth inhibition than ws at high ethylene concentrations .

our results show that the effect of the loss of ers <dig> on growth recovery was similar in all five sets of receptor mutants at high ethylene concentrations. ligand binding did not induce bulk ers <dig> degradation, nor block the growth inhibition by ers <dig>  in addition, ethylene-treated receptor mutants exhibited different seedling hypocotyl lengths, suggesting that the ethylene receptors are not equally inactivated by ethylene. alternatively, the signaling ability of each receptor member may differ.

discussion
previous genetic analyses implied that ethylene responses are negatively regulated in arabidopsis by five ethylene receptors, which are functionally redundant and not exchangeable  <cit> . unexpectedly, our results suggest that ers <dig> can also promote ethylene responses. the underlying mechanism for the positive effect of ers <dig> on ethylene responses needs further investigation. currently, the nature of the ethylene receptor signal is unknown, limiting further biochemical studies on the mechanisms of negative regulation by ers <dig>  etr <dig> and ers <dig> can form a heteromeric complex  <cit> ; our data and other studies suggest that the unique ers <dig> function is etr <dig> dependent, because the addition of ers <dig> to the etr1- <dig> null mutant does not result in growth recovery. one explanation is that ers <dig> may partially negate etr <dig> activity upon formation of the etr1-ers <dig> heteromeric complex. alternatively, ers <dig> may partially titrate out available rte <dig>  which promotes etr <dig> signaling. ctr <dig>  a raf-like protein, may directly relay the receptor signal to repress the ethylene response  <cit> . another possibility is that ers <dig> may inhibit ctr <dig> activity in the presence of etr <dig> 

heterosis may occur upon mixture of different genetic backgrounds  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that the growth recovery by ers <dig> mutations in our study was unlikely to be result of ecotype mixture. the ers <dig> allele is in ws and the addition of ers <dig> to receptor mutants elevated growth inhibition, rather than causing growth recovery. additionally, complementing ers <dig> by a col- <dig> ers1p:ers <dig> transgene in ers1- <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> restored growth inhibition. if the growth recovery had been caused by ecotype mixture, ers1p:ers <dig> would not be able to restore growth inhibition. we also showed that the ers <dig> protein level was related to the degree of growth inhibition, early leaf senescence, and chib expression levels in etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig>  these data all favor the argument that ers <dig> may promote ethylene responses. we do not exclude the possibility that there may be genetic modifier that can cause some degrees of growth recovery upon ecotype mixture. nevertheless, our results suggest that the effects of those genetic modifiers on growth recovery are far from sufficient to reverse ethylene growth inhibition to the level of ers <dig> 

in the ethylene dose-response assay, both ers1- <dig> and ers1- <dig> displayed a slightly shorter seedling hypocotyl than ws at low ethylene concentrations, and their seedlings were longer than ws at high ethylene concentrations. ers <dig>  like other receptors, is able to repress ethylene responses  <cit> , although it also inhibits growth, as shown in our study. conceivably, the effects of ers <dig> on growth inhibition can be weakened by ers <dig> receptor signaling at low ethylene concentrations; thus, ers <dig> displayed stronger growth inhibition than ws. at high ethylene concentrations, ers <dig> receptor signaling is blocked, while the effects of ers <dig> on growth inhibition become stronger due to ers <dig> accumulation; thus, ers <dig> displayed weaker growth inhibition than ws. notably, ers1- <dig> displayed stronger growth inhibition than ers1- <dig> at 10-1μl l- <dig> ethylene, indicating that growth inhibition was partly reversed by residual ers <dig> receptor signaling in ers1- <dig>  this result lends support to our hypothesis that in wild type the effects of ers <dig> signaling on repressing ethylene responses are stronger than the effects of ers <dig> on promoting ethylene responses. thus, ers <dig> displayed growth inhibition at low ethylene concentrations in ws.

the five ethylene receptors of arabidopsis are structurally similar to his-kinase proteins. ers <dig> and ers <dig> lack the receiver domain, the possible functions of which remain elusive. the inhibitory effects of ers <dig> on ethylene receptor signaling are unlikely to be due to its lack of the receiver domain, because ers <dig> does not have the same effects as ers <dig> 

interestingly, etr1- <dig> ers1- <dig> displays an extremely strong constitutive ethylene response phenotype   <cit> . subfamily i receptors are thought to help subfamily ii members activate ctr <dig>  allowing signal output to repress the ethylene response  <cit> . another argument is that the subfamily i receptors play more dominant roles than subfamily ii receptors in the regulation of ethylene signaling, possibly due to his-kinase activity, the ability to associate with ctr <dig>  or higher expression levels  <cit> . phenotypic analyses of etr <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> and ers1- <dig> suggest that effects of ers <dig> on regulating ethylene signaling are very minor. although etr <dig> alone represses ethylene response to a great extent, according to the ers <dig> etr <dig> ein <dig> ers <dig> mutant phenotype, the etr1- <dig> mutation does not reciprocally result in the de-repression of the ethylene response. it appears that receptor signal strength is not additive. we thus favor the first scenario, in which subfamily i members may be important for subfamily ii signaling. we previously showed that ag fails to restore seedling hypocotyl growth in etr1- <dig> ers1- <dig>  <cit> , lending support to the hypothesis that subfamily ii signaling is dependent on subfamily i. while the loss of a single subfamily i member does not significantly affect subfamily ii signaling, etr <dig> and ers <dig> are functionally redundant in the regulation of subfamily ii receptor signal output.

emergent function refers to features that are accomplished by multiple genes with similar function, but not by single genes  <cit> . unique roles of subfamily i receptors in ethylene signaling may imply one emergent function for etr <dig> and ers <dig>  positive effects of ers <dig> on ethylene responses only occur in the presence of etr <dig>  implying another emergent function of etr <dig> and ers <dig>  ethylene receptor signaling may thus be regulated at higher levels involving receptor interactions or collaboration, rather than by receptor number or amount.

CONCLUSIONS
our work, together with previous studies, shows that growth recovery caused by ers <dig> loss-of-function mutations throughout developmental stages in ethylene receptor mutants is etr <dig> dependent. ers <dig>  which is in the ws ecotype, did not have the same effect as ers <dig> on growth recovery. complementing the ers1- <dig> mutation with ers1p:ers <dig> restored growth inhibition. ers <dig> overexpression resulted in elevation in ethylene response phenotypes, including growth inhibition, early senescence, and elevated chib expression. these results provide support for the argument that growth recovery by ers <dig> mutations is not due to ecotype mixture. ers <dig> plays a role in repressing ethylene responses, and has inhibitory effects on etr1-specific ethylene signaling. ethylene receptor signaling may be regulated at multiple levels, including positive and negative collaborations among receptors.
