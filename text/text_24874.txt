BACKGROUND
the number of recombinant proteins used for therapeutic applications has greatly increased in recent years. for manufacturing complex biopharmaceuticals the chinese hamster ovary  expression system is the leading production platform due to appropriate product secretion, post-translational processing, a simple means of cultivation and up-scaling, a reasonable safety profile and last but not least the approval from regulatory authorities  <cit> . to keep pace with the needs of the market, optimizing efforts are required, including also upstream process development. in this context, the genetic vector construct has to be considered since it significantly affects productivity  <cit> . for production purposes recombinant genes are usually transfected into the target cells as cdna constructs in combination with a mammalian active expression cassette  <cit> . the gene promoter is the key element and it determines the strength and the temporal kinetics of transcription. frequently, constitutive viral promoters are used in mammalian expression cassettes like the promoter/enhancer element of the human and mouse cytomegalovirus , the sv <dig> immediate early promoter or the rous sarcoma virus  long-terminal-repeat  promoter  <cit> . however, these strong promoters can also trigger the undesired silencing phenomenon due to methylation of the promoter region and part of histones  <cit>  or otherwise induce stress responses leading to incorrect protein folding or even apoptosis. another problem relates to cell-cycle dependence of these promoters that may cause high cell to cell variation in the amount of recombinant protein expressed.

due to these disadvantages, cellular promoters have been investigated for the purpose of recombinant protein expression. the best known among those are derived from house-keeping genes that encode abundantly transcribed cellular genes, such as beta-actin or ribosomal proteins. a successful example of a cell specific constitutive promoter represents that of the cho-derived elongation factor- <dig>  gene  <cit> , where high expression levels were observed for several genes and different cell lines. additional constitutive promoters that have been identified in cho cells include the chinese hamster cofilin , the ch1433e and the chinese hamster 14-3- <dig> epsilon promoter. more recently the rat ferritin heavy chain  gene locus has been reported by prentice et al.  <cit>  to be suitable for foreign gene expression.

compared to viral promoters, little is known about mammalian promoters, since eukaryotic gene expression is more complex and requires a precise coordination of many factors for efficient gene transcription. common to all polymerase ii promoters is a shared architecture consisting of the core and a proximal promoter  <cit> . some of the known core promoter elements are the tata box, the first element identified in eukaryotic genes, the initiator element and the downstream promoter element  <cit> . beside tata-box promoters, the majority of mammalian promoters occur as so called cpg island promoters  <cit>  where the methylation status of stretches of the cg dinucleotide and their open chromatin organization can act as a transcriptional regulator  <cit> .

the goal of this approach is to obtain an effective endogenous cho promoter which can be used for the expression of recombinant genes. owing to its functional integrity described problems, observed with many viral expression cassettes, can be avoided. here we report about the successful identification of a novel highly active gene promoter obtained from cho cells that shows conditionally inducible gene expression at reduced temperature. in this study we investigated the full length promoter sequence and different mutant constructs in transient luciferase activity gene reporter assays.

RESULTS
 <dig>  identification of the cho s100a <dig> gene
potential promoter candidates were selected from a list of abundantly transcribed genes that was obtained from cho microarray expression data  <cit> . the s100a <dig> was selected as target gene due to its high amount of mrna levels and its response to "cold shock" conditions in various cho parental and recombinant cell lines. for identifying the gene in its genomic context a cho-k <dig> genomic lambda-phage library  was screened using a dig-labeled cdna probe specific for s100a <dig>  approximately 6x <dig> clones of the library were screened in the first round yielding only a single positive clone which was amplified during the next round and further enriched in the third screening step by duplicate plaque hybridization. the dna of the positive lambda clone was isolated and purified. the presence, size and orientation of the genomic fragment was confirmed by pcr using gene specific primers together with the t <dig> and t <dig> promoter primer binding to the multiple cloning site of the lambda dna. the results revealed the presence of about  <dig> kb of the 3' non-translated sequence of the cho s100a <dig> gene, located near the t <dig> site in reverse direction. amplification reactions by antisense s100a <dig> primers and t <dig> promoter primer failed, presumably due to the larger genomic region at this site. the entire insert of the lambda clone was sequenced by primer walking . in total,  <dig>  kb of cho genomic sequence were analyzed and found to contain  <dig>  kb of 5' upstream sequence of the s100a <dig> gene encoding two other members of the s <dig> gene cluster , and  <dig>  kb of genomic cho sequence at the 3' flanking region.

to map the positions of intron-exon junctions, the cho s100a <dig> genomic sequence was aligned to the corresponding locus of other mammalian species using align and seqman program. the chinese hamster s100a <dig> gene spans approximately  <dig>  kb of chromosomal dna and consists of three exons and two introns whereof the first exon is non-translated sequence. the organization of the cho s100a <dig> gene is coherent with the human and mouse gene  <cit>  and is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the initiating atg codon could be identified in the second exon at position  <dig> and the translation stop signal is positioned at nucleotide   <dig> of exon- <dig>  due to the conserved exon-intron architecture .a phylogenetic relationship can be assumed for this gene. cho s100a <dig> coding sequence  is 94%, 94% and 92% identical to the mouse, rat and human sequences, respectively. in contrast, the 5'-utr, 3'-utr and introns are predominantly divergent.

 <dig>  computational analysis of functional promoter elements
promoteractive sequences are usually located within a distance of  <dig> bp upstream the transcriptional start site  <cit> . here, a fragment of  <dig>  kb of the 5' non-translated sequence of the cho s100a <dig> gene was investigated. computational analysis of this region was performed using several freely available online prediction tools for eukaryotic pol-ii promoters  to identify putative tss.

a putative core promoter was identified including a tata box that is located at position - <dig> to - <dig>  further upstream, in close vicinity, two putative sp <dig> binding sites were found at position - <dig> and - <dig>  a third sp <dig> consensus sequence is located at position - <dig> within intron  <dig>  prediction of the tss was different between two programs used for analysis. the neural network promoter prediction program identified two tss, one of which is located within intron  <dig> at position - <dig> and the second at position - <dig>  whereas one common tss was found at position - <dig> using the fprom and tssg program. considering the possibility for alternative transcripts, position - <dig>  seems to be most preferentially utilized in the cho s100a <dig> gene since it is in agreement with the tss of the human s100a <dig> tss, gcccatcccc,  <cit> . a preference for position - <dig>  is consistent to the view that the initiator  has the consensus element yyanyy   <cit> .

in addition a search of potential cpg islands was performed using the cpgislands searcher http://www.uscnorris.com/cpgislands2/cpg.aspx and the emboss cpgplot software http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/emboss/cpgplot. one putative island region of  <dig> nts  extending from nts - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the atg start signal was predicted by the cpgislands searcher. this is in good agreement with emboss cpg report which identifies an island of  <dig> nts from - <dig> to - <dig>  this sequence partly overlaps exon  <dig> and comprises two sp <dig> consensus sites .

 <dig>  promoter mapping and dissection
the  <dig>  kb upstream region of the cho s100a <dig> gene was examined for promoter activity using a transient reporter gene assay. in addition, a variety of deletion mutants were constructed by successive removal of 5' and 3' nts in order to identify transcription active regions. the different promoter constructs are shown in fig  <dig> 

all promoter constructs were inserted into the promoter-less basic vector pgl3-basic  between the kpni-hindiii sites immediately upstream the reporter gene firefly luciferase. as control vector the empty pgl3-basic plasmid was used to determine the background levels in this assay. vector pgl3-promoter  that contains the simian virus  <dig>  promoter and the same vector backbone was used as positive control. quantitative reporter assays were done in co-transfection experiments in order to standardize experimental variations like transfection efficiency or differences in cell numbers between samples. as a second plasmid prl-sv <dig> which encodes the renilla luciferase gene under control of the sv- <dig> promoter was co-transfected along with each promoter construct under study and the control plasmids. since the obtained light signal of the renilla plasmid usually is higher as compared to firefly luciferase, only one tenth of the second vector was used. for measuring the luminescence signal of both reporter proteins the dual-glo assay  was used which allows a consecutive measurements of both proteins from the same cell sample.

 <dig>  transcriptional activity of promoter constructs in cho cells
the activity of  <dig> different promoter constructs  including the full-length variant  together with the control plasmids was investigated for reporter gene expression. immediately after co-transfection, cells were split and transferred to 12-well plates. one set of plates was incubated at 37°c, the other at 33°c.  <dig> hrs after transfection, aliquots of each sample were prepared and quantitatively analyzed. the calculation of promoter activity was done by dividing the signal from firefly luciferase by that of renilla and after that the values were normalized to the corresponding pgl3-p positive control samples which were set to 100%. an overview of the activity of  <dig> promoter constructs plus two controls is shown in figure  <dig> 

the double truncation constructs, p <dig> and p <dig>  are both lacking  <dig> nts immediately upstream the atg translation start codon. the absence of this region does not seem to be critical for promoter functionality, since the activity was comparable to the full-length construct  and other mutants  all of which include these initial  <dig> upstream nts at their 3' end. as concluded from p <dig>  the removal of nts upstream  <dig> from the 5' end did not reduce activity. therefore a series of 5'-truncations were made to narrow the critical promoter region. up to construct sps <dig> which includes nts 1- <dig> no significant reduction was observed whereas a dramatic loss near almost background levels was noticed for the shorter constructs sps <dig> to sps <dig>  since construct sps <dig>  containing  <dig> nts, exhibits full activity, this 5' end was considered critical and additional constructs were designed by successively truncating 3' nts . the four long constructs ds <dig> - ds <dig> showed fairly high promoter activity  and even the shortest, ds <dig>  comprising only  <dig> nts reached similar expression levels compared to the full-length promoter sequence. only ds <dig> which encodes  <dig> nts fell below  <dig> percent of the top constructs and below  <dig> percent of the sv <dig> expression value. this clearly indicates that missing nts between ds <dig> and ds <dig> are important for promoter activity although their absence does not completely diminish the functionality. a closer look at this sequence reveals the presence of the predicted cpg island  that overlaps the predicted tss and a tata-box occurring in this region. constructs ds <dig> and ds <dig> were designed to investigate the effect of regulatory elements. common to both constructs is the presence of two sp <dig> transcription factor binding sites  at positions 671- <dig> and 690- <dig>  but ds <dig> lacks the tata-box and the predicted tss at 620/ <dig>  this may explain the drop in activity observed in the shortest construct. further we investigated the effect on transcription by deleting one of the sp <dig> sites. construct sps <dig> which encodes nts  <dig> to  <dig> including both sp <dig> sites, showed 80-90% expression strength of the control vector. in contrast, sps <dig> which encodes only nts  <dig> to  <dig> and lacks one essential sp <dig> binding side, completely lost promoter functionality. according to these results the core promoter sequence including both tfbs and the predicted transcription start site is located in exon- <dig> which overlaps with the putative cpg-island.

promoter analyses under hypothermic conditions revealed even higher activity for all tested variants. in general, reduced temperature caused a boost in expression of about 200% on average . at 33°c, three of the 5' deletion constructs sps <dig>  sps <dig> and sps <dig> showed a substantial enhancement in reporter gene expression of more than 2-fold when compared to the corresponding samples of 37°c and more than 3-fold of the sv <dig> control vector under temperature shift conditions. sps <dig> and sps <dig> showed the strongest response to temperature change and the other 5' truncation constructs, sps <dig>  sps <dig> and sps <dig> could be activated >2-fold upon a shift to 33°c.

with length decreasing a reduction in temperature response was observed; see ds13-ds <dig> and p <dig> and p <dig>  these mutants lack up to  <dig> nts in the 3' region which seems to contribute to this lower temperature sensitivity since expression levels were found to range between  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold of the control values at 37°c under these experimental conditions. we observed that reporter gene expression of all promoter variants is strictly time dependent and rapidly increasing over time. whether this is caused by the accumulation of the reporter protein in the cell remains to be examined. consequently, all measurements were done exactly  <dig> hours after transfection of the cells. remarkably, the ratio of expression levels between the sv <dig> control and the constructs under study stayed constant up to a sampling time of  <dig> hours in the temperature shift experiments.

 <dig>  the core promoter sequence
our next aim was to further minimize the promoter and characterize more precisely its functional elements. concluding from our results we identified sequence elements upstream  <dig>  essential for full promoter activity. truncations at the 5'-site as far as position  <dig>  did not result in diminished activity. even in construct sps <dig>  with all nucleotides deleted upstream position  <dig>  indeed a decrease but no loss of expression was detected resulting in a slightly lower activity than the sv <dig> control. according to these findings, we designed a new "minimal" construct, ds <dig>  which extends from nts  <dig> to  <dig>  the 5'-end position  <dig> was chosen, since a putative nf-ĸb binding site  was included. this site is conserved among chinese hamster, mouse and rat  and its involvement in the regulation of the human s100a <dig> gene expression was studied by joo et al.  <cit> . also the two sp <dig> sites and the tata box motifs are present in the promoter region of the other two species.

in our study we directly compared ds <dig>  and ds <dig> , the so far smallest construct with full promoter activity. its activity was found equal to ds <dig>  the initially identified minimal promoter. the results of this paragraph are summarized in figure  <dig>  the nf-ĸb binding site seems to be necessary for full promoter function since lacking of this site in sps <dig>  results in decreased activity down to a level of 65% as compared to sps <dig> .

several cis-acting elements can also be important for reverse-oriented transcription except for the original tata box. the gc box has been reported to exhibit such reverse function and some mammalian promoters have been identified to show antisense activity, e. g. murine dfna <dig>  <cit> . thus the function of s100a <dig> core promoter in inverse orientation was also tested. we designed the inverse constructs ds18-rev and ds16-rev to determine if transcription can be initiated in this configuration. both showed low but detectable activity of about 20% of theirs original sequence. this activity was similar to the level of the sp <dig> deletion construct 16-∆sp <dig> .

in order the study the function of sp <dig> sites, both were deleted from construct ds <dig> generating 16-∆sp <dig>  leaving only the tata-box intact. lacking of only  <dig> bp, including two putative sp <dig> sites, dramatically decreased promoter function to about 20% indicating that both conserved sp <dig> sites are essential for functioning of the s100a <dig> promoter. this observation is relevant to the view that the sp <dig> site, a gc hexanucleotide, is sufficient for sv <dig> promoter activity and frequently appears as multiple copies.

several studies have investigated the effect of promoter duplication on homologous and heterologous gene expression. it was shown that a second copy of the promoter or at least its essential regions can function like cis-acting enhancer elements. this strategy has been evolutionally developed by eukaryotic viruses in order to enhance the synthesis of their rna genome  <cit> . for biotechnological applications it is important to achieve high and reliable expression levels. in an attempt to enhance transgene expression, the effect of adding extra tfbs by duplicating parts of the promoter region while maintaining the spatial arrangement was analysed by pena and whitelaw  <cit> . for the purpose of such a use we generated construct 18-doub, having two consecutively repeated core promoter sequences  to test for increased activity. we observed that this tandem repeat stimulates transcription more effectively  than a single element, and the distance of the sp <dig> site from the tata box may have some influence.

 <dig>  conformation of temperature dependent promoter activity by quantitative real-time  pcr
quantitative real-time pcr was used to verify the results obtained by luciferase reporter gene expression studies of different constructs in temperature shift experiments. measured protein levels at standard  and reduced temperature  were compared to specific mrna levels of two representative promoter constructs, namely the full-length construct  encoding  <dig> nts immediately upstream the atg and the  <dig> nts core promoter sequence . the same constructs were assayed in parallel for luciferase protein expression at both temperatures. figure  <dig> depicts the fold-change values of mrna and protein levels at 33°c compared to 37°c for the two promoter variants at  <dig> hours post transfection.

 <dig>  the role of mrna stability in regard to transcript abundance of the s100a <dig> gene at low temperature
insearch of a possible mechanism for enhanced mrna levels upon lowering temperature we compared the structural and functional properties of the s100a <dig> gene to well characterized mammalian cold shock proteins , namely the cold-inducible rna binding protein   <cit>  and rna binding motif protein  <dig>   <cit> . they have been recognized as regulators of gene expression by acting as rna chaperones through binding of misfolded rna thereby preventing transcription termination  <cit> . their expression is modulated by alternative mrnas with ires-like activity that increases translation  <cit> . the 5'-utr of cho s100a <dig> gene was therefore searched by a web-based ires secondary structure prediction tool  <cit> http://polya.umdnj.edu/polya_svm, but no ires-like structure could be predicted, whereas three potential cap-independent translation initiation sites where found in the 5'-utr of the human cirp gene  that served as control. thus, the cho s100a <dig> gene does not seem to have structural similarity to the csp's 5'-utr and we assume another regulatory mechanism. another structural feature of csps is the presence of widely conserved binding domains  that accounts for affinity to single stranded rna and dna. appar.ntly, the s100a <dig> protein lacks such motifs as well as the ability to attach to rna/dna. it rather interacts with many biological targets via protein-protein binding.

in addition, we did a comparative literature search for the regulatory and functional features of the human s100a <dig> ortholog with a focus on the gene promoter and various stimuli that have been identified to upregulate its expression. these include growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, hormones and tumor inducing agents  <cit> . upon stress conditions such as ischemia, mechanical force, irradiation or oxidative stress the s100a <dig> gene promoter is activated at the transcriptional level by upstream stimulatory factor  and nf-ĸb  <cit> . usf binds to the e-box response element, a hexanucleotide motif that is also present in the cho s100a <dig> gene promoter at almost the same position: e-box cho: -273/-268; human: -283/- <dig> upstream the transcription start site. recent data provide evidence that usf may be another stress responsive transcription factor activated by uv and osmotic shock, heat-shock and cadmium  <cit> .

since upregulation of the s100a <dig> gene, induced by stress or other stimuli, is primarily based on transcriptional control we conclude that cold shock stress in our experiments predominantly triggers a transcriptional response. to test as to whether rna turnover is also involved in regulation we measured mrna stability of the promoter constructs at lower  and standard culture temperature. for that purpose the full-length promoter construct  was selected. the transcription inhibitor actinomycin d was added to the culture and the level of the target mrna was determined at several time points by quantitative rt-pcr. this allows calculating mrna decay and the corresponding half-live. as internal control β-actin was selected as reference since its mrna expression is considered not to be affected by lowering culture temperature  <cit> . due to the short lived nature of mrna we followed its concentration during  <dig> hours after inhibiting transcription. at each time point mrna levels of the reporter gene ß-actin stayed remarkably constant. also, mrna levels of the promoter construct did not differ significantly after the first  <dig> hours at both temperatures. however,  <dig> hours after actinomycin d treatment a decay of about 33% was detected at 37°c, whereas in the parallel test culture at 33°c mrna only decreased about 5% . this observation indicates that mrna stability is enhanced by lowering culture temperature which also contributes to higher mrna levels.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of the cho s100a <dig> promoter sequence was based on the analysis of microarray transcriptomics data described by  <cit> . due to sparse genomic resources that are publicly available for the chinese hamster we took a conventional approach for target identification by screening a cho-k <dig> genomic lambda phage library. the isolated positive phage clone comprises a fragment of  <dig>  kb genomic cho dna encoding the s <dig> gene locus including family members a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  the cho s100a <dig> gene consists of three exons and two introns, and its coding sequence is highly conserved between mouse, rat and human. according to computational analysis, a sequence region of  <dig>  bp upstream of atg start codon was termed as full-length promoter and tested together with a number of promoter variants in functional promoter assays. a core promoter region of only  <dig> bp could be identified revealing almost similar activity than the full-length construct. several regulatory elements were identified as essential factors to allow for full promoter function. a drop in activity was observed when either the tata-box or the nf-ĸb binding site was absent. also the lack of two sp <dig> binding sites in the core promoter region caused a drastic reduction in activity. on the other hand, functional activity of the "minimal" promoter could be considerably enhanced when two tandem repeats were joined together. considering additional aspects beside transcriptional upregulation of the s100a <dig> gene we could also identify mrna stability that contributes to transcript abundance at lower temperature.

in addition, the cho s100a <dig> promoter shows conditionally inducible gene expression at reduced temperature resulting in two- to three-fold increase in gene expression compared to basal activity at standard temperature. this temperature dependent activity can be advantageous to reduce expression during the initial growth phase and at later production phase it allows to boost expression of the recombinant gene. it is particularly valuable that this increase of productivity is achieved at low temperature culturing conditions which normally reduces overall cell metabolism of competitive processes but obviously not the expression of the gene of interest. another benefit is the potential for the manufacturing of toxic products since gene expression and cell metabolism do not negatively interfere as compared to conventional mammalian production technology.

the area of improving recombinant protein production by the use of reduced temperature cultivation has been documented by several investigators  <cit> . although lowering the culture temperature often increases specific productivity, its effect on productivity is variable among cho cell lines  <cit>  and there are conflicting reports in the literature. al-fageeh et al.  <cit>  suggested optimization of cell growth at 37°c followed by a "cold-shock" but contradictorily it has been demonstrated that adaptation of cho cells to low culture temperatures can enhance specific growth rates whereas recombinant protein production decreases  <cit> .

in case of the s100a <dig> promoter, increased activity after "cold shock" treatment does not result from prolonged generation time like in batch cultures or effects that can be attributed to reduced cell metabolism since we determined expression levels shortly after transient transfections. higher productivity is directly connected to increased specific mrna transcription rate which we observed for parental and recombinant cell lines, including also cho-k <dig>  the use of this promoter for high level protein expression under hypothermic condition therefore demonstrates an attractive alternative in production techniques since it combines both, a novel genetic construct that is directly linked to the individual process conditions with the potential for improving the performance also for other mammalian expression systems.
