BACKGROUND
mustard gas  is a chemical weapon that can easily and inexpensively be produced and used against military or civilian populations with both acute and devastating long-term effects  <cit> . it produces rapid damage to eyes, skin and pulmonary tissues as well as subsequent damage to many internal organ systems  <cit> . despite its long history of use, starting in world war i, the molecular mechanisms for hd toxicity are not fully understood and there is continuing research on the design of optimal countermeasures. mustard gas acts as an alkylating agent covalently modifying dna, proteins and other macromolecules. there is increasing evidence that hd or cees toxicity is due, in part, to an enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> , increased oxidative stress  <cit>  and the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species   <cit> . hd and cees have been shown to shift the intracellular redox milieu toward a more oxidized state by reacting with and depleting the intracellular antioxidant gsh with a subsequent loss of protection against ros and an activation of inflammatory responses  <cit> .

in a previous publication, we showed that the cytotoxicity of cees towards murine raw  <dig>  macrophages was markedly enhanced by the presence of low levels of lps , or pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e.,  <dig> ng/ml il-1β or  <dig> ng/ml tnf-α  <cit> . lps is part of the cell wall of gram negative bacteria: it is ubiquitous and is found in serum, tap water and dust. both civilian and military personnel would always have some degree of exposure to environmental lps. hd induced skin lesions often have secondary infections which could markedly increase lps levels. in macrophages, stimulation by lps, as well as by pro-inflammatory cytokines, leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor nf-κb . one of the major consequences of such activation in macrophages is an induction of inos expression with subsequent elevation of intracellular no  <cit> . in addition to nf-κb activation, the binding of transcription factor stat- <dig>  to the inducible nitric oxide synthase  promoter is required for optimal induction of the inos gene by lps  <cit> .

in a recent publication, we found that cees transiently inhibits nitric oxide  production by suppressing inos protein expression in lps stimulated macrophages  <cit> . no production is an important factor in promoting wound healing  <cit>  and inos deficiency impairs wound healing in animal models  <cit> . raw  <dig>  macrophages have undetectable levels of inos or no production in the absence of lps and in the presence of lps they show a marked induction of inos and no production  <cit> .

in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the synergistic cytotoxic effect of cees with lps is due to increased oxidative stress with a subsequent depletion of intracellular gsh levels and an increase in protein carbonyls. in some cell types, gsh has also been found to regulate no generation with decreased gsh levels associated with decreased no production  <cit> . vos et al.  <cit>  found that gsh depletion in hepatocytes prevented inos induction by cytokines but this effect could be reversed by the addition of nac. we, therefore, hypothesized that the addition of nac to stimulated macrophages would reverse the loss of no production caused by cees. we also reasoned that polymyxin b, by binding to lps, would diminish cees toxicity in lps treated macrophages.

RESULTS
the influence of nac on cell viability and no production in cees/lps treated macrophages
in order to further evaluate nac as a potential protective agent for cees toxicity in stimulated macrophages, we did two additional experiments in which nac was added to macrophages  <dig> h prior to cees application or  <dig> h after cees application. these additional experiments provide a measure of the potential time frame during which nac could be therapeutically useful. similar to the previous experiment, lps and cees were added simultaneously . as shown in figure 2a, nac had a substantial protective effect on cell viability when added  <dig> h before cees/lps; however nac did not protect against loss of no production in cees/lps-treated cells . when added  <dig> h after cees treatment , nac was much less effective in protecting the macrophages but still resulted in at least a doubling of the cell viability compared to the cells not treated with nac. as shown in figure 3b, nac added  <dig> h after cees/lps, also failed to restore no production.

we believe that the difference in viability of cells stimulated with lps in the absence or in the presence of nac  could represent experimental variation since relatively small differences are being compared. in the contrast, the protective effect of nac on cees+lps treated macrophages is robust and over seven fold. this point is further reinforced by the data shown in figure 3a, where viability of cells stimulated with lps in the absence or in the presence of nac was not significantly different.

the influence of nac on oxidative stress and no production, intracellular gsh and thiols in cees/lps treated macrophages by fluorescence microscopy
the influence of nac on macrophages treated with cees/lps was also examined by fluorescent microscopy using three fluorescent probes: a) carboxy-dichlorofluorescin diacetate , a sensor for combined ros and reactive nitrogen oxide species  generation  <cit> ; b) 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin , an indicator of intracellular gsh  <cit> , and; c) 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate , a probe for total non-protein cellular thiol levels that lacks specificity for gsh  <cit> .

simultaneous treatment with  <dig> mm nac reduced the car-dcf fluorescence observed in lps stimulated cells, as well as in cees or cees+lps treated raw  <dig>  macrophages . these data qualitatively suggest that cees and cees+lps treatments induce oxidative stress in raw  <dig>  macrophages that can be diminished by nac treatment.

as a next step we examined intracellular levels of gsh using the cmac probe  and levels of total intracellular thiols using the cmf-da probe . both the cmac and cmf probes revealed similar qualitative patterns: cees or cees+lps treatment for  <dig> h caused cellular gsh and thiol depletion but treatment with lps alone did not. these data reinforce the notion that treatment with either cees alone or treatment with cees+lps induces sufficient oxidative stress to reduce intracellular gsh and thiol levels. lps alone, however, did not induce gsh or thiol depletion. nac application was found to inhibit the loss of gsh and thiol levels caused by cees or cees+lps treatment .

the microscopic data  show merged visible/fluorescent images, thus allowing cell counting and the monitoring of cell morphology changes. the counts of live  cells under conditions described above  confirmed the major observations from the mtt-derived data :  nac treatment enhance  the viability of cees+lps treated macrophages;  cees+lps is more toxic than cees alone. the cells count  were 57% ±  <dig>  76% ±  <dig>  18% ±  <dig>  84% ±  <dig>  75% ±  <dig>  67% ±  <dig>  54% ±  <dig>  respectively for macrophages treated with cees , lps , cees+lps, nac , nac+cees, nac+lps and nac+cees+lps.

quantitative effects of cees on gsh status and protein carbonyl levels in lps-stimulated raw  <dig>  macrophages
since the fluorescence microscopy data presented above are primarily qualitative, we wanted to confirm our results by a more quantitative approach. we, therefore, determined the effect of  <dig> μm cees on the gsh/gssg status of raw  <dig>  macrophage treated or untreated with  <dig> ng/ml lps for  <dig> h. total gsh  and gssg concentrations were measured in cell lysates using a quantitative gsh assay kit and the values normalized to total protein content of the lysate . figure  <dig> shows that both total gsh and gssg levels in macrophages treated with either vehicle alone or lps were not significantly different, i.e., similar to our fluorescent microscopy data. however, cells treated with cees alone showed a depletion in total gsh as well as an increase in gssg levels; cells treated with both cees and lps were further depleted in total gsh and the percentage of gssg in these cells was the highest . these results show that lps alone does not induce a significant oxidative stress, cees alone induces a moderate oxidative stress but the combination of both cees and lps induces the highest observed level of oxidative stress.

in addition, we measured the protein carbonyl levels in control cells, cells treated with cees  alone or cells simultaneously treated with both lps  and cees  for  <dig> h. protein carbonyls are stable protein oxidation products. the combination of cees and lps produced about  <dig>  fold increase in protein carbonyl levels, however cells treated with cees alone were not significantly different from control cells treated with vehicle alone . cells treated with lps alone were not assayed in this experiment since both our qualitative  and quantitative data  showed no evidence of oxidative stress with this treatment.

the inability of nac to reverse no loss in cees/lps treated cells is not gsh dependent
the data in figure 1b show that nac has almost no ability to restore no production in lps-stimulated macrophages treated with cees. an inability of nac to prevent the depletion of gsh in lps-stimulated cells treated with cees could possibly explain these results. in order to explore this possibility, we examined the ability of  <dig> mm nac to prevent gsh depletion in lps  stimulated and cees treated  raw  <dig>  cells. figure  <dig> shows that cees treatment alone decreased intracellular gsh by only about 10% compared to lps stimulated cells in the absence nac. as expected, the decrease in gsh levels was quite large in cells treated with both cees+lps  but treatment with  <dig> mm nac was effective in preventing this loss. the data shown in figure  <dig> were obtained by hplc analyses of the cell lysates but similar results were obtained by using a fluorometric assay for gsh  <cit>  . despite the fact that nac can increase the gsh level by three fold in cees+lps treated cells it does almost nothing to increase no production . these data suggest that the loss of no production in cees treated stimulated macrophages is not gsh dependent as has been observed in some other cell lines  <cit> .

polymyxin b diminishes cees toxicity in lps-treated macrophages and partially blocks lps induced no production
polymyxin b is an antibiotic drug, which selectively binds and neutralizes lps. since lps enhances cees toxicity, we tested the ability of polymyxin b to reduce cees toxicity  and decrease no generation in lps  stimulated macrophages. figure 7a shows that polymyxin b  had no cytotoxic effect on raw  <dig>  macrophages but partially reduced the cytotoxicity of cees+lps treated cells . nevertheless, polymyxin b produced at least a six fold increase in cell viability compared to cell treated with both lps and cees for  <dig> h. as shown in figure 7b, polymyxin b effectively blocked the production of no  in lps  treated macrophages as would be expected if it bound and blocked the action of lps.

discussion
the cytotoxic effect of hd, and its analogue cees, is believed to involve an increased generation of damaging free radicals and ros  <cit> . the data presented here show that lps in combination with cees induces intracellular gsh and thiol depletion as well as increased levels of protein carbonyls. in experiments with various human cell lines we have found that gsh depletion is relatively rapid as it occurs within first hour of incubation . thus, it is likely that this depletion is due, in large part, by a direct reaction of cees with gsh. the measurement of protein carbonyls is one of the best indices for oxidative stress due to the stability of protein carbonyls and sensitivity of the measurement  <cit> . cellular thiols are important markers of the redox state of the cell. in particular, gsh is one of the major components of the intracellular redox system and a key intracellular antioxidant that functions as a substrate for glutathione peroxidase which detoxifies both hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides  <cit> . depletion of intracellular stores of gsh plays an important role in the development of oxidative stress  <cit> . recent work also suggests that the anti-apoptotic protein bcl- <dig> directly interacts with gsh to regulate an important mitochondrial gsh pool that influences mitochondrial oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis  <cit> . it is highly possible that both sulphur and nitrogen mustards possess a similar ability to deplete cellular thiols and induce protein oxidation.

taken together, our data strongly suggest that cees induces oxidative stress in stimulated macrophages. moreover, the pattern of oxidative stress parallels the pattern observed for cees cytotoxicity, i.e., cytotoxicity and oxidative stress are amplified in cells treated with both cees and lps. the addition of 5– <dig> mm nac, a well characterized water-soluble antioxidant, was found to be very effective in minimizing cees toxicity in stimulated macrophages and in preventing gsh depletion. our data suggests that nac can be added five hours before or even five hours after cees and still exert a cytoprotective effect. das et al.  <cit>  recently found that nac in drinking water was effective in reducing cees-induced lung toxicity to guinea pigs. fan et al.  <cit>  have shown that liposomal encapsulated nac delivered intratracheally was more effective than free nac against acute respiratory distress syndrome in a rat model. it is interesting, therefore, that mcclintock et al.  <cit>  have shown that reducing agents , as well as some anti-oxidant enzymes, delivered via liposomes, can substantially diminish cees-induced injury in rat lungs. we are currently formulating an optimal antioxidant liposome preparation for treating either lung or skin induced cees/hd injury.

we previously reported that cees induces a transient loss of inos protein expression in lps stimulated raw  <dig>  macrophages but does not inhibit the enzymatic activity of inos. based of the work of others  <cit> , we hypothesized that nac treatment would not only be protective against cees toxicity but would also restore no production in lps stimulated macrophages treated with cees. our results indicate, however, that this was not the case. our data did, however, show that nac effectively increases cell viability, increases gsh levels and reduces oxidative stress in lps stimulated macrophages treated with cees.

cees could inhibit inos protein synthesis by a number of possible molecular mechanisms which we are currently exploring  <cit> . it is generally accepted that both the transcription factor nf-κb and stat- <dig> play central roles in the lps induction of inos  <cit> . it is possible that cees/hd could inhibit the nf-κb and/or the stat- <dig> pathways in raw  <dig>  macrophages and consequently block inos gene expression. for instance, cees could alkylate the nf-κb consensus nucleotide binding sequences thereby preventing the binding of activated nf-κb to the inos promoter and block the subsequent production of inos mrna and protein expression. previous studies in vitro have shown that dna alkylation by cees  <cit>  or by nitrogen mustard  <cit>  can inhibit the dna binding of transcription factor ap <dig> or nf-κb.

alternatively, the dna binding ability of the nf-κb and/or stat- <dig> transcription factors could be reduced by direct covalent modification by cees or as an indirect result of gsh depletion, i.e., redox regulation. nishi et al.  <cit>  have found, for example, that the cysteine- <dig>  residue of the p <dig> nf-κb protein subunit is oxidized in the cytoplasm but reduced in the nucleus, and that the reduced form is essential for nf-κb dna binding. it is possible that cees could rapidly react with cys- <dig> of the p <dig> nf-κb subunit and prevent its dna binding. however, since nac was found to restore gsh levels without restoring inos activity , it is unlikely that a gsh redox modulation of the p <dig> cys- <dig> is the molecular mechanism for cees induced loss of inos protein in lps-stimulated macrophages. this cannot, however, be completely ruled out based on our current data.

moreover, there is evidence suggesting that alkylating agents do not inhibit but rather promote nf-κb activation. it is known that cees or hd treated cells release elevated levels of tnf-α and also show nf-κb activation both in vitro and in vivo as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays  <cit> . minsavage and dillman recently demonstrated that nf-κb is activated by hd treatment in human cell lines via nonclassical p53-dependent pathway  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that the inhibition of inos expression by cees or hd could be due to downregulation of the stat- <dig> and/or classical nf-κb pathway. we are currently exploring these various molecular mechanisms.

in the work presented here, we also tested the ability of polymyxin b to block the effect of lps. polymyxin b binds to the lipid a domain of lps and neutralizes its activity. our data show that polymyxin b effectively inhibits cees toxicity in lps stimulated cells. in vivo, lps could directly enhance cees/hd toxicity in cells with functional cd <dig> receptors or by triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α and il-1β, by immune cells. we have previously demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines also enhance cees cytotoxicity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our in vitro work presents novel evidence supporting the view that oxidative stress is an important component of cees/hd toxicity and that antioxidants have therapeutic potential. we anticipated that nac would prevent gsh depletion and restore the loss of inos activity in cees treated macrophages stimulated with lps. although nac was effective in preventing both cees toxicity and gsh depletion, it failed to restore inos expression. our results to date indicate that cees causes a transient decrease in inos protein syntheses rather than a direct inhibition of inos activity due to covalent modification by cees. we are currently investigating the molecular mechanism for the down regulation of inos expression by cees.

inhibition of inos and no production could be an important element in the slow wound healing observed subsequent to cees/hd injury. considerable evidence suggests that inos is an important component of wound healing  <cit> . although nac maybe effective at reducing cees/hd toxicity it is not effective at elevating no production due to inos inhibition by cees/hd. a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for inos inhibition by cees/hd could, therefore, be useful in the design of more effective countermeasures.

the fact that lps was found to enhance cees toxicity highlights the potential importance of preventing secondary infection in the treatment of hd toxicity.

lps is a component of gram negative bacteria and a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. its presence at very low levels  amplifies the toxicity of cees. polymyxin b, a topically applied antibiotic that binds lps, was shown to block the inos inducing ability of lps and to reduce cees toxicity in lps stimulated cells. polymyxin b could, therefore, be useful as a supportive treatment in order to prevent secondary infections and to reduce hd toxicity, since it both neutralizes lps and prevents the growth of gram-negative bacteria in healing wounds.

the path to an optimal countermeasure to cees/hd exposure may lie in a poly-drug formulation that minimizes oxidative stress, prevents inflammation and secondary infections, and, also, protects inos activity. antioxidant liposomes are currently being investigated as they have unique ability for targeted delivery of both water-soluble and lipid soluble antioxidants  <cit>  or other drugs, for instance, polymyxin b  as well as anti-inflammatory agents.
