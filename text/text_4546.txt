BACKGROUND
the transcription factor foxp <dig> is essential for immune system regulation due to its role in the development and function of regulatory t cells   <cit> . the dramatic autoimmune phenotype that is caused by mutated foxp <dig> in both mice and humans led to its initial identification  <cit> . in the absence of foxp <dig>  lethal autoimmunity ensues. sequencing of the foxp <dig> genes from ipex  patients revealed function ablating mutations throughout domains critical for foxp <dig> function  <cit> . the scurfy mouse is an autoimmune mutant that has a spontaneous truncation mutation in foxp <dig>  in addition to its well-studied role in tregs, an emerging body of work has revealed foxp <dig> to be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer  <cit> . foxp <dig> activates and suppresses a broad range of genes, but the mechanisms by which this happens are not well-understood  <cit> . by understanding the relationship between foxp <dig> and its binding partners, we hope to illuminate how foxp <dig> operates as a powerful regulator of immune activation.

already, foxp <dig> is reported to reside in a supramolecular complex  <cit>  and a number of specific interactions have been identified  <cit> . co-immunoprecipitation  demonstrated binding between foxp <dig>  and the following partners: the nfκb p <dig> subunit  <cit> , tip <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  <cit> , foxp <dig>  <cit> , runx1/aml <dig>  <cit> , the ap- <dig> constituent, cjun  <cit> , rorα  <cit> , rorγt  <cit> , and eos  <cit> . also, foxp <dig> homo-oligomerizes  <cit> . wu el al  <cit>  demonstrated that foxp <dig> inhibits the transcriptional enhancing effects of nfat and ap- <dig> by disrupting their interaction.

regulation of il- <dig> gene expression is critical to immune tolerance, treg development and treg function  <cit> . foxp <dig> inhibits il- <dig> production in tregs and confers il- <dig> suppressive function in trans  <cit> . even before tregs and foxp <dig> became inextricably coupled, researchers investigated the effect of foxp <dig> on il- <dig> transcription  <cit> . while il- <dig> is not the sole target of foxp <dig>  <cit> , coordinated investigations into molecular interactions localized to the il- <dig> promoter have been a successful strategy thus far, towards understanding foxp3's function as a transcriptional regulator.

here we report a previously unidentified foxp <dig> binding partner, siva. the novel interaction was exposed in a yeast two-hybrid screen for foxp <dig> binding partners. we were interested in siva for its known cell death promoting properties  <cit> . the possibility of a pro-apoptotic molecule that might confer treg properties was intriguing. also, siva binds tumor necrosis factor receptor  family members associated with  the treg surface phenotype: cd <dig>  gitr , and ox <dig>  <cit> . siva was first identified based on its cd27-binding activity, which was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation  studies in 293t cells transiently transfected with cd <dig> and gfp-tagged siva  <cit> . in a subsequent study, the same group showed that the cd <dig> cytoplasmic tail mediated the interaction between both isoforms, siva- <dig> and siva- <dig>  <cit> . the cytoplasmic region of cd <dig> shares a high degree of homology with gitr, and ox <dig>  which prompted the investigation and confirmation that these other tnfr family members also interact with siva  <cit> . gitr is highly expressed on tregs and attributes suppressive properties under certain conditions  <cit> . in a transient transfection system, siva and gitr functionally interacted to exacerbate apoptosis  <cit> . thus, we investigated siva because of its pro-apoptotic properties and its ability to bind tnfr family members that are associated with the treg surface phenotype.

our data shows a physical interaction between foxp <dig> and siva protein exogenously expressed in 293t cells. we mapped the foxp3-interacting domain to the c-terminus of siva. the central portion of foxp <dig>  106-332) contains siva-binding activity. we found that siva repressed il- <dig>  the repressive effect of siva on il- <dig> appears to be mediated by nfκb, as our data and others show a negative regulatory effect for siva on nfκb activity  <cit> . consistent with previous reports  <cit> , we observed that foxp <dig> repressed nfκb and nfat. to conclude, while the pro-apoptotic effect of siva has been thoroughly demonstrated and documented, this analysis of siva's effect on il- <dig> contributes evidence for siva's role in t cell signalling.

RESULTS
siva physically interacts with foxp3
a yeast two-hybrid screen for foxp3-binding partners was performed with a human thymus cdna library. six full-length clones for siva- <dig> were identified in the screen. we chose siva- <dig> for further investigation for two reasons. first, siva regulates t cell apoptosis and, second, because siva associates with tnfr family members that might contribute to treg function: cd <dig>  gitr, and ox <dig>  <cit> .

we tested whether foxp <dig> and siva could interact in mammalian cells. two isoforms, siva- <dig> and siva- <dig>  <cit> , have been described and their protein domain organization is depicted in figure 1a . siva- <dig> lacks the second exon, resulting in a protein that is missing most of the spherical amphipathic helix  and death domain homology region   <cit> . we performed co-immunoprecipitation  experiments with transfected 293t cell lysates. we transfected 293t cells with expression plasmids for egfp-tagged siva isoforms and myc-tagged foxp <dig>  or the appropriate vector control. myc/foxp <dig> was immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-myc hybridoma supernatant, 9e <dig>  as shown in figure 1b, by western blotting  with an antibody against gfp, we detected co-ip of siva- <dig> and siva- <dig> in the presence of myc/foxp <dig>  but not in its absence. egfp alone did not co-ip with foxp <dig> . thus both siva- <dig> and siva- <dig> specifically interact with foxp <dig> 

next, we wanted to know whether siva was expressed in foxp3-expressing treg cells. we examined siva expression profiles contained within the microarray dataset generated by fontenot et al. from foxp3gfp knock-in mice  <cit> . fontenot et al. sorted cd4pos t cells for cd <dig> and foxp3gfp. the data shown in figure 1c demonstrates that siva is expressed in cd4pos t cells that are both positive and negative for foxp <dig> expression. siva is preferentially associated with cd <dig>  a marker associated with both the treg phenotype and t cell activation. thus, siva and foxp <dig> are co-expressed in mouse tregs that express the cd <dig> surface marker.

siva-binding activity is contained within foxp3's central region
major domains of the foxp <dig> protein are associated with specific functional activities and binding partners    <cit> . the foxp <dig> n-terminus is required for nfat-mediated repression of il- <dig>  <cit>  and is involved in binding to the rorγt and rorα transcription factors  <cit> . the leucine zipper  domain mediates homodimerization of foxp <dig>  which contributes to treg suppressive function  <cit> . the c-terminal foxp <dig> forkhead  domain is required for dna binding and nuclear localization  <cit> . a short stretch of amino acids between the zinc finger  and the fkh domain is involved in runx1/aml <dig> binding and is involved in il- <dig> repression  <cit> .

we used myc/foxp <dig> truncation mutants to characterize the region involved in binding to siva by co-ip in 293t cells . mutants lacking the fkh domain  or the n-terminus  bound to siva with similar efficiency as full length foxp <dig> . the foxp <dig> fkh mutant repeatedly showed lower expression than other foxp <dig> mutants . the reduced level of expression might have contributed to the lack of binding between foxp <dig> fkh and egfp/siva- <dig>  still, based on the siva-binding activity of the Δfkh mutant, we conclude that the foxp <dig> fkh domain is not necessary for siva-binding activity. foxp3's siva-binding activity is located within the protein's central region , which spans the leucine zipper, the zinc finger and runx1-binding domains.

the siva c-terminus is sufficient to bind foxp3
as shown in figure 3a, we designed siva truncation mutants fused to egfp's c-terminus to cover major domains that have been previously described and associated with functional properties  <cit> . we performed co-ips to map siva's foxp3-binding activity. our analysis definitively showed no interaction between foxp <dig> and siva mutants lacking the c-terminus . in contrast, all mutants containing some portion of the cysteine rich siva c-terminal domain interacted with foxp <dig>  given that the siva c-terminus mutant and the Δzn f mutant both contain the b box domain and both interacted with foxp <dig>  we hypothesized that the siva b box domain might be necessary and sufficient to bind foxp <dig>  to test our hypothesis, we designed mutants encompassing the siva b box domain and full length siva lacking the b box domain . subsequent co-ip experiments demonstrated a very weak, but detectable interaction between foxp <dig> and the siva b box domain. the siva Δb box mutant was fully competent to bind foxp <dig>  thus, the siva b box domain appears unnecessary and insufficient to bind foxp <dig> .

siva negatively regulates il- <dig> gene expression
we next investigated siva's effect on il- <dig> gene expression. in order to evaluate the effect of siva overexpression on endogenous il- <dig>  we transduced jurkat t cells with phsp-egfp/siva- <dig> or phspg-siva- <dig> retrovirus . figure 4a shows a representative gating scheme used to measure cell viability and transduction efficiency. this basic gating scheme was used in subsequent experiments throughout this report. for each experiment, gfpneg cells were used to determine the position of all gates and quadrant boundaries. we normalized il- <dig> expression levels to viable cell counts in order to examine siva's effect on il- <dig> separate from siva's effect on apoptosis. the repressive effect of egfp/siva- <dig> and siva- <dig> on endogenous il- <dig> in jurkat t cells are shown in figures 4b &4c, respectively. egfp/siva- <dig> repressed endogenous il- <dig> by nearly 90% compared to phspg transduced cells . in a separate experiment, overexpression of siva- <dig> also repressed endogenous il- <dig> gene expression . next, we tested the effect of siva knockdown  on endogenous il- <dig> gene expression . jurkat t cells were transduced with plko lentivirus  expressing shsiva or shegfp, as a control shrna. the dna gel confirms siva kd based on rt-pcr using primers specific for both siva isoforms. siva kd enhanced il- <dig> gene expression compared to the shegfp control, providing further evidence that siva acts as a negative regulator of il- <dig> gene expression.

siva negatively regulates il- <dig> promoter activity
in addition to measuring siva's effect on endogenous il- <dig> protein levels, we tested the effect of siva gene expression on il- <dig> promoter activity. a minimal enhancer element located  <dig> base pairs immediately upstream of the il- <dig> start site regulates transcription through the binding of transcription factors and alterations in the chromatin structure  <cit> . distal regulatory elements also contribute to il- <dig> gene regulation and the minimal enhancer region is sometimes referred to as the proximal promoter. in order to investigate siva's effect on il- <dig> transcriptional activation, we used a reporter plasmid containing the il- <dig> proximal promoter driving expression of the luciferase enzyme. again, in order to examine siva's effect on il- <dig> separate from siva's effect on apoptosis, we normalized il- <dig> transcriptional activity to viable cell counts. siva overexpression inhibited il- <dig> transcriptional activity  and siva kd enhanced il- <dig> transcription .

foxp <dig> and siva repress endogenous il- <dig> gene expression
in order to test whether foxp <dig> and siva functionally interact to repress endogenous il- <dig>  we co-expressed foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> in jurkat cells by transduction with phspg rv . as expected, foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> each repressed endogenous il- <dig> independently . the combination of foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> failed to repress il- <dig> further than foxp <dig> alone. we also examined the combined effects of siva kd and exogenous foxp <dig> on il- <dig>  figure 6c shows the efficiency of siva kd in jurkat t cells transduced with plko lvs expressing hairpin rna against siva or egfp and pg rv expressing foxp <dig>  consistent with data shown above, siva kd enhanced il- <dig> gene expression . foxp <dig> effectively repressed il- <dig> gene expression independent of endogenous siva expression levels. thus, in this experimental system, foxp3-mediated repression of endogenous il- <dig> appears to be independent of siva gene expression levels.

effect of foxp <dig> and siva on il- <dig> promoter activity
in addition to evaluating the combined effects of foxp <dig> and siva on endogenous il- <dig> gene expression, we investigated whether the two genes might functionally interact to repress il- <dig> transcriptional activity. first, we tested the effect of foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> overexpression on the transcriptional activity of the il- <dig> proximal promoter in the jurkat t cell luciferase assay. we transfected jurkat t cells with the il- <dig> reporter plasmid and different combinations of phspg, phspg-siva- <dig> and phspg-foxp <dig> in equal plasmid dna mass. as indicated by the data in figure 7a, both siva- <dig> and foxp <dig> repress il- <dig> transcriptional activity independently. the repressive effect of foxp <dig> is stronger than siva- <dig>  we do not see an additive effect on il- <dig> repression between siva- <dig> and foxp <dig>  in addition, we tested the combined effect of siva kd and foxp <dig> overexpression on il- <dig> transcriptional activity . as expected, siva kd enhanced il- <dig> transcriptional activity. however, foxp <dig> over expression masked the il- <dig> enhancing effect of siva kd. thus, similar to the endogenous il- <dig> experimental results, the il- <dig> transcriptional activity assays suggest that foxp3's repressive effect masks the repressive effect of siva.

effects of foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> on nfκb and nfat activity
il- <dig> is regulated by multiple transcription factors and chromatin modifications  <cit> . we tested the effects of siva- <dig> and foxp <dig> on the transactivating potential of two major il- <dig> transcriptional regulators, nfκb and nfat. in these experiments, the reporter construct contains a luciferase gene that is regulated by three tandem repeats of either the nfκb consensus sequence from the mhc class i promoter  <cit>  or the nfat binding site from the human il- <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . consistent with published reports and shown in figure  <dig>  foxp <dig> inhibits nfκb  <cit>  and nfat  <cit>  transactivation potential in jurkat t cells. siva repressed nfκb , but had no effect on nfat activity . the combination of foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> repressed nfκb activity more than foxp <dig> alone. even though the nfκb repressive effect of the two genes in combination was slight , the effect was reproducible with statistical significance.

discussion
in this report we have shown that foxp <dig> and siva physically interact. we have mapped the binding activities to limited domains within each protein. foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> both independently repressed il- <dig> gene expression. one mechanism by which siva- <dig> represses il- <dig> is via inhibition of nfκb. in contrast, foxp <dig> repressed the activity of both il- <dig> transactivators tested here, nfκb and nfat. although we did not reveal a functional interaction between foxp <dig> and siva with regards to il- <dig> repression, the biophysical interaction invites questions regarding how siva might contribute to regulation of foxp3-expressing treg cells.

the physical interaction was demonstrated through a standard protein-protein interaction, co-ip assay. two siva isoforms have been identified and both siva isoforms interact with foxp <dig>  the siva- <dig> isoform lacks the second exon that encodes for the sah and ddhr domains  <cit> , which were found to be dispensable for binding foxp <dig> in subsequent siva truncation co-ip experiments. the siva c-terminus, which encompasses both the putative b box and zn f domains, contained foxp <dig> binding activity.

the siva c-terminus is enriched with cysteine residues that could be important to the protein's tertiary structure and function. paired cysteine residues are associated with intramolecular disulfide bond formation. the siva c-terminus contains six paired cysteine residues. nestler et al  <cit>  used truncation mutants to show that siva coordinates three zinc ions, two of which are associated with the c-terminus  <cit> . although a few groups have found that the siva c-terminus is necessary to interact with other binding partners  <cit> , no one has described whether specific c-terminal point mutations block siva function. future site-directed mutagenesis studies of the siva c-terminal cysteine residues could be informative to further characterize the physical interaction between siva and foxp <dig> 

foxp3's siva-binding activity is contained within a broad central region that includes the zinc finger, the leucine zipper and the runx <dig> binding domain . mutants missing either the first  <dig> n-terminal amino acids or the c-terminal forkhead domain sustained binding to siva- <dig>  further experiments are needed to define a minimal region of foxp <dig> involved in binding to siva- <dig>  the foxp <dig> leucine zipper domain is required for homodimerization, il- <dig> repression, and treg suppressive function  <cit> . given that the leucine zipper domain is within the region that binds siva- <dig>  one question we are interested in addressing in the future is whether known leucine zipper ipex mutations  <cit>  interfere with foxp <dig> binding to siva- <dig> 

one limitation of this study was that technical challenges obstructed our efforts to detect a biophysical interaction between endogenously expressed foxp <dig> and siva. also, we have not yet performed sufficient experiments to address whether the biophysical interaction could be linked to any functional interaction. in order to test whether the biochemical interaction between foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> affects their functional interaction, a minimal region of biochemical interaction for at least one protein needs to be identified. more extensive point mutant co-ip experiments for at least one of the proteins could be informative towards defining the relationship between the biophysical interaction and any proposed functional interaction for foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> 

our initial hypothesis was that foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> might functionally interact to repress il- <dig> gene expression. we did not observe an additive repressive effect between foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> on il- <dig> gene expression. instead, our data suggests that foxp <dig> might be a dominant suppressor that masks the repressive effects made by siva- <dig> on il- <dig> gene expression.

our analysis of two il- <dig> transactivators supports the assertion that siva- <dig> and foxp <dig> affect shared and different il- <dig> regulatory mechanisms. consistent with previous reports, foxp <dig> repressed nfκb  <cit>  and nfat  <cit>  transactivation reporters. siva- <dig> inhibited nfκb, but had no effect on nfat in cells stimulated with pma and ionomycin. we observed a small, but significant additive repressive effect between foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> on nfκb activity.

the nfκb-repressive effects that we observed for foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> are consistent with published reports. the effects of each gene on nfκb activity may be partitioned into distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear signalling events. in resting cells, cytoplasmic iκbα sequesters the canonical nfκb subunits p <dig> and p <dig>  preventing their nuclear translocation. in response to stimulus, iκbα breaks down and releases the nfκb subunits, which translocate to the nucleus  <cit> . siva blocked nfκb nuclear accumulation via stabilization of cytoplasmic iκbα  <cit> . on the other hand, foxp <dig> blocked nfκb transactivation potential by mechanisms independent of nuclear translocation and dna binding  <cit> . further, our group showed that foxp3's promoter-dependent effects on nfκb transactivating potential were independent of nuclear translocation. foxp <dig> enhanced hiv- <dig> gene expression by increasing the amount of nfκb p <dig> subunit bound to the ltr   <cit> . to summarize, in separate experimental systems, inhibition of nfκb activity by siva has been shown to occur upstream of iκbα degradation and nuclear translocation, whereas foxp <dig> inhibits nfκb activity downstream of iκbα degradation. the biophysical interaction that we have presented suggests that another regulatory mechanism could be occurring that would involve co-localization of foxp <dig> and siva- <dig> within the same subcellular compartment.

given that siva has displayed both nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular localization  <cit> , the possibility remains that siva could regulate gene transcription from within the nucleus in addition to its cytoplasmic effect on nfκb. as of yet, published reports of a nuclear specific function for siva are lacking. most detailed investigations of siva function have examined siva in relation to transmembrane signalling molecules or mitochondrial-associated apoptosis regulators thought to be present in the cytoplasm, not in the nucleus  <cit> . in future studies, it will be interesting to look into whether siva displays nucleus-specific activities such as direct binding to dna or chromatin.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, we have carried out an analysis of il- <dig> gene regulation by foxp <dig> and siva in jurkat t cell lines. foxp <dig> and siva both repress il- <dig> gene expression independently, though the repressive effect of foxp <dig> appears to be dominant over siva in both assays used here. we have shown that foxp <dig> and siva appear to have a slight, but significant, additive repressive effect on nfκb activity. many questions remain, most importantly, those regarding siva's contribution to treg development and function. additional efforts are needed to address these intriguing possibilities.
