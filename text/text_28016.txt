BACKGROUND
both basic and clinical science can greatly benefit from vectors that induce cell death in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. inducible death vectors do not only contribute to determining the precise effect of specific cells on behavior  <cit> , development  <cit> , and disease  <cit> , they can also provide critical tools for treatment of many diverse diseases, including adoptive immune transfer, cancer therapy, atherosclerosis, stem cell transplantation, or viral infection  <cit> . enzymes and toxins of bacterial or viral origin are frequently used to kill the targeted cells. however, they are not necessarily the best choice for all applications, due to complications that can arise from immune responses  <cit> , cell cycle dependence  <cit> , and bystander killing  <cit> . ectopic expression of endogenous pro-apoptotic proteins is an attractive alternative, because they should be non-immunogenic, they initiate a well-established cellular program  <cit> , and their target cells are frequently primed for apoptosis  <cit> .

the pro-apoptotic proteins most often used in such applications are caspases  <cit>  and members of the bcl- <dig> family, like bims  <cit> , bax  <cit> , or truncated bid   <cit> . tbid is generated by cleavage of bid through activated caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  granzyme b, and cathepsins. translocation of tbid to the mitochondria leads to the release of cytochrome c resulting in the activation of apoptosis-inducing caspases  <cit> . transient or inducible expression of tbid leads to rapid and efficient induction of apoptosis in a variety of cell lines  <cit> .

thus, this pro-apoptotic protein represents a promising candidate for a suicide gene therapy that aims at specifically eliminating cells infected by human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  before infectious viruses are produced. an infection with hiv- <dig> is still incurable despite constant improvements to antiretroviral therapy which dramatically reduced the mortality rate of hiv-1-infected patients  <cit> . unfortunately, a substantial fraction of these patients still experiences therapy failure and/or serious side effects due to the treatment. this is often accompanied by the emergence of drug-resistant viruses  <cit> . thus, improving the existing approaches and finding new antiretroviral strategies remains a major challenge in the fight against hiv- <dig>  numerous suicide genes have already been tested, for instance, bax  <cit> , protein kinase r  <cit> , caspase- <dig>  <cit> , the host shut-off protein of herpes simplex virus  <cit> , diphtheria toxin a  <cit> , and barnase  <cit> . however, most of them were either not efficient enough and/or cell death was not induced fast enough ultimately resulting in insufficient inhibition of hiv- <dig> replication. the kinetics observed and the very low protein concentrations needed to induce cell death by tbid  <cit>  would fulfill two major requirements of a successful suicide gene: efficiency and immediacy.

another obstacle to this approach is the basal activity of the hiv- <dig> ltr promoters used, which led to unspecific cell death of hiv- <dig> uninfected cells  <cit> . the new retroviral vector plred2r utilizes three distinct elements originating from hiv- <dig> to more stringently regulate transgene expression: i) it contains the 5' and 3' hiv- <dig> ltr, so that efficient gene expression requires hiv- <dig> tat  <cit> ; ii) the vector comprises the hiv- <dig> rev-responsive element  leading to rev-dependence for mrna transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit> ; and iii) two hiv- <dig> inhibitory sequences  of the gag gene are incorporated into this vector further enhancing the dependency on rev in terms of mrna export significantly  <cit> . this vector fulfills the criterion of hiv- <dig> specificity and, consequently, provides a safe gene therapy vector.

here, we replaced the reporter gene dsred in the improved hiv- <dig> indicator plasmid plred2r  <cit>  with the very potent suicide protein tbid. the resulting suicide vector was highly dependent on hiv- <dig> tat and rev for target gene expression. it very efficiently and rapidly induced apoptosis in vitro before infectious viruses were released from the hiv- <dig> infected cell and, therefore, provides a promising gene therapy approach against hiv- <dig> infection.

RESULTS
tbid induces efficiently and rapidly cell death in hela ss <dig> cells
to estimate the susceptibility of the cell line hela ss <dig> towards induction of cell death by the human pro-apoptotic protein tbid, we transiently co-transfected these cells with the plasmid pcmv-tbid which constitutively expresses tbid under control of a cmv-promoter, and with pegfp-c <dig> allowing us to determine transfection efficiencies by measuring green fluorescence.  <dig> hours after transfection, gfp was expressed in 63% of the hela ss <dig> cells . this number increased to >90%  <dig> hours after transfection .

tbid induced cell death in ~97% of the hela ss <dig> cells within  <dig> hours after transfection with pcmv-tbid and in ~94% of pcmv-tbid/pegfp-c <dig> co-transfected cells . similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments. interestingly, the co-transfected hela ss <dig> cells died before gfp expression was detected indicating very rapid induction of cell death, in agreement with published data for hela cells  <cit> . time-course experiments confirmed this observation: light microscopic analyses showed apoptotic hela ss <dig> cells already  <dig> hours after transfection .

induction of cell death by tbid in the suicide vector pltbid2r strongly depends on the presence of both hiv- <dig> tat and rev
first, we characterized the control vector plred2r  in transiently transfected hela ss <dig> cells or in hela-tat cells, constitutively expressing the hiv- <dig> tat protein. dsred was not expressed in the absence of tat and rev or in the presence of only one of both viral proteins . co-transfection of hela ss <dig> cells with the plasmids plred2r, pcmv-tat and -rev led in  <dig> % of the cells to a >10-fold induction of dsred fluorescence after  <dig> hours , this number further increased to >40% during the next  <dig> hours . in hela cells stably expressing the hiv- <dig> tat protein, dsred fluorescence increased up to three orders of magnitude in the presence of both tat and rev   <cit> . as already observed in pegfp-c1-transfected hela ss <dig> cells, it takes about  <dig> hours to reach sufficient dsred expression. next, we determined the number of dead cells in hela ss <dig> cells transfected with the control vector plred2r alone or in combination with pcmv-tat and/or -rev. all cells transfected displayed similar morphology , and the number of dead cells determined by propidium iodide staining was in the range of  <dig> - <dig> % and, thus, similar in all transfections .

we then replaced the reporter gene dsred with tbid to generate the suicide vector pltbid2r . hela ss <dig> cells were transfected with this vector and co-transfected with pcmv-tat and/or -rev.  <dig> hours after transfection, light microscopic analysis showed that the morphology of the transfected cells represented living cells in all transfections containing the suicide vector pltbid2r alone or in combination with either pcmv-tat or -rev. however, co-transfection of both pcmv-tat and -rev together with the suicide vector pltbid2r rapidly induced microscopic signs of cell death like cell shrinkage and rounding . cell death was also quantified by staining the cells with propidium iodide  <dig> hours after transfection.  <dig> % of the cells were dead in cell cultures transfected only with the suicide vector pltbid2r, a number similar to the control transfections. thus, induction of cell death was not observed in the absence of tat and rev despite using the very sensitive hela ss <dig> cell line. we also did not observe any increase in cell death induction  <dig> or  <dig> hours after transfection . expression of rev alone did not lead to induction of cell death by tbid. here, only  <dig> % of the cells stained positive with propidium iodide . the presence of tat moderately induced cell death in the absence of rev . taken together, these results show that this vector is not leaky. only expression of both hiv- <dig> regulatory proteins tat and rev strongly induced cell death in co-transfected hela ss <dig> cells. here, 86% of the cells were dead  <dig> hours after transfection . at this same time point, only  <dig> % of the cells were dsred-positive when co-transfected with the control vector plred2r and pcmv-tat plus -rev indicating that very low amounts of tbid are sufficient to induce cell death.

co-transfection of pltbid2r and pnl4-3-nef-ires-gfp leads to rapid induction of cell death before virus particles are produced
to investigate whether hela ss <dig> cells transfected with the suicide vector pltbid2r undergo cell death before infectious hiv- <dig> virions are generated and released, we co-transfected cells with the suicide vector pltbid2r and the hiv- <dig> full-length clone pnl4-3/gfp. the latter construct contains a gfp reporter gene within the open reading frame for nef, ensuring that gfp is expressed together with tat and rev early in the hiv- <dig> life cycle.  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the hela ss <dig> cells co-transfected with pnl4-3/gfp and the control vector plred2r expressed gfp  <dig> hours after transfection in three independent experiments. these transfection efficiencies are similar to control experiments performed with a gfp-expressing plasmid of approximately the same size as pnl4-3/gfp  . in contrast, only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the hela ss <dig> cells co-transfected with pnl4-3/gfp and the suicide vector pltbid2r expressed gfp  <dig> hours after transfection suggesting that cell death is induced in the co-transfected hela ss <dig> cells before green fluorescence becomes detectable. the approximately 28-fold difference in the amount of gfp-positive cells between both transfections is highly significant with a p-value < <dig>  . transfections using only pnl4-3/gfp revealed similar results as co-transfections with the control vector plred2r and pnl4-3/gfp . we also collected cell-free supernatant daily for  <dig> days after transfection and analyzed the production of virus particles by determining the content of viral p <dig> in the supernatant. in the presence of the control vector plred2r, the replication kinetics of hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig> were similar to those observed in hela ss <dig> cells only transfected with pnl4-3/gfp . however, we were not able to detect p <dig> in any supernatant from a cell culture co-transfected with the suicide vector pltbid2r and pnl4-3/gfp within fours days after co-transfection agreeing with the results obtained by measuring gfp expression in those cells.

to determine if the inhibition of virus replication is due to the rapid induction of cell death, we measured the percentage of dead cells  <dig> hours after transfection with pnl4-3/gfp or co-transfections with pnl4-3/gfp and either the control vector plred2r or the suicide vector pltbid2r. cells were stained with the dead cell discrimination reagent. on average,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the cells transfected with pnl4-3/gfp or co-transfected with pnl4-3/gfp and the control vector plred2r, respectively, were dead  <dig> hours after transfection . a strongly significant increase in the percentage of dead cells was observed in hela ss <dig> cells  <dig> hours after co-transfection with pnl4-3/gfp and the suicide vector pltbid2r . this clearly demonstrates that the expression of tat and rev from transfected hiv- <dig> dna induces cell death rapidly and efficiently enough to prevent the production of new virus particles.

inhibition of hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig> replication in pltbid2r-cd <dig> transfected hela ss <dig> cells
next, we investigated the functionality of our suicide vector pltbid2r in the context of infectious hiv- <dig> particles. we introduced a cmv-expressed cdna for the hiv- <dig> receptor cd <dig> into the suicide vector pltbid2r obtaining pltbid2r-cd <dig>  we transfected hela ss <dig> cells, which do not physiologically express the cd <dig> receptor with pltbid2r-cd <dig>  this guarantees that only cells containing the suicide vector would be permissive for hiv- <dig> infection, thereby eliminating the possibility of virus replication in hela ss <dig> cells only transfected with a cd <dig> expression plasmid if a co-transfection approach using separate plasmids would have been used. plred2r-cd <dig> was constructed as control vector. hela ss <dig> cells were infected with hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig>  <dig> hours after transfection and viral p <dig> was measured daily in cell-free supernatants. to control for transfection efficiency and consistency, cd <dig> expression was measured  <dig> hours after infection by facs analysis. plred2r-cd4- and pltbid2r-cd <dig> transfected hela ss <dig> cells expressed similar levels of cd <dig> . hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig> did not replicate in mock-transfected or untransfected hela ss <dig> cells . hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig> replication was inhibited by  <dig> ±  <dig> % on day  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> % on day  <dig> after infection compared to virus replication in hela ss <dig> cells transfected with the control vector plred2r-cd <dig> . we also quantified the amount of dead cells  <dig> hours after infection, i.e.,  <dig> hours after transfection.  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the mock-transfected and  <dig> ±  <dig> % of the plred2r-cd <dig> transfected hela ss <dig> cells were dead . these percentages of dead cells are higher compared to the amount of dead cells in our previous hela ss <dig> transfections using plred2r and pnl4-3/gfp. this is mainly due to the different time points chosen to measure the proportion of dead cells . an even higher increase in the number of dead cells was observed in pltbid2r-cd <dig> transfected hela ss <dig>  suggesting that those cells were also dying due to the induction of tbid expression by hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig>  this high amount of dead cells was significantly different compared to mock-transfected cells ; the difference was not significant compared to plred2r-cd4-transfected hela ss <dig> cells . however, the latter is caused by cytopathic effects resulting from the hiv- <dig> infection itself, which would also explain the higher amount of dead cells in plred2r-cd <dig> transfected hela ss <dig> cells compared to mock-transfected cells.

discussion
despite several set-backs, the development of suicide vector systems can still be a promising approach for gene therapy of hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> . they can be used to reduce viral burden by killing infected, virus-producing cells  <cit>  and to target and eliminate the reservoir of latent hiv- <dig>  <cit> . they might even be used to modify stem cells prior to their transplantation into the patient  <cit> . these booby-trapped hematopoietic cells would commit suicide upon infection by hiv- <dig>  thereby interrupting the viral replicative cycle and reducing viral load. however, for such an approach to function, several requirements have to be fulfilled. first, the suicide vector must be strongly hiv- <dig> dependent without compromising the rapid induction of the suicide gene by the viral proteins. second, the suicide gene itself has to be fast and efficient in its induction of cell death, to ensure target cell elimination before infectious virus particles are generated. third, the suicide gene should not be immunogenic. fourth, the suicide system has to be delivered efficiently to the hiv- <dig> target cells. so far, no published system fulfills all of these necessities. in our proof-of-concept study, we addressed the first three requirements.

the suicide vector pltbid2r contains the hiv- <dig> ltrs, thus, expression of tbid depends on hiv- <dig> tat. however, the hiv- <dig> ltr alone would lead to unspecific expression of tbid as frequently observed using solely hiv- <dig> ltr-based vector systems  <cit> . the rre present in the suicide vector pltbid2r reduces this leakiness, because expression now depends on both tat and rev  <cit> . in addition, the suicide vector pltbid2r comprises two ins-containing regions of the hiv- <dig> gag gene. they increase the dependency on rev, thereby reducing basal activity even further  <cit> . we tested the control vector plred2r in hela ss <dig> cells showing that the expression of dsred is strongly dependent on the simultaneous presence of tat and rev. we observed no leakiness of the suicide vector pltbid2r in the very sensitive cell line hela ss <dig> transfected only with pltbid2r or co-transfected with pcmv-rev. the presence of tat alone slightly induced the expression of tbid followed by induction of cell death in a small number of cells. however, only the presence of both tat and rev significantly enhanced the induction of cell death introduced by tbid showing that the system is not leaky and that it strongly depends on the hiv- <dig> proteins tat and rev. it is promising that no leakiness was observed in cells stably transfected with the control vector plred2r for more than  <dig> months. in addition, dsred expression was still inducible by hiv- <dig> tat and rev after  <dig> months  <cit> .

the human pro-apoptotic protein tbid is the effector molecule of our suicide vector pltbid2r. tbid fulfills several qualifications of a suitable suicide protein: i) cell death is induced within hours after expression of tbid, ii) tbid is efficient in very low concentrations  <cit> , iii) it is not immunogenic as, for instance, viral suicide proteins  <cit> , and iv) it has been successfully applied as suicide protein in a gene therapeutic approach where breast cancer cells were specifically killed by tbid in vitro  <cit> . we observed rapid induction of cell death in hela ss <dig> cells within  <dig> hours after transfection of pcmv-tbid. similar kinetics and efficacies had previously been shown in several cell lines  <cit>  including jurkat t lymphocytes  <cit> .

we tested the cell death inducing properties of our suicide vector pltbid2r with respect to hiv- <dig> using different experimental approaches. first, we co-transfected cells with the suicide vector pltbid2r and the full-length hiv- <dig> clone pnl4-3/gfp. a few hours after transfection, before infectious hiv- <dig> particles were generated, the cells started to die. here, no release of virus particles was observed as revealed by p <dig> elisa. second, cells were transfected with the suicide vector pltbid2r-cd <dig> and infected with infectious hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig>  virus replication was strongly reduced and the amount of dead cells increased compared to hela ss <dig> cells transfected with the control vector plred2r-cd <dig>  although we have not measured tbid directly in dying cells due to the very low amounts of tbid sufficient to induce apoptosis  <cit> , which makes it very difficult to detect tbid with conventional detection methods, we are convinced that tbid expression induced cell death. in all our experiments, we used the isogenic vector plred2r as control and we never observed any indication of increased cell death induced by dsred.

in contrast to the co-transfection experiments using pnl4-3/gfp, the inhibition of virus particle production was incomplete when pltbid2r-cd <dig> transfected hela ss <dig> cells were infected with hiv- <dig> nl4- <dig>  this is not due to the replacement of nef by gfp in pnl4-3/gfp, because we obtained similar results using pnl4- <dig> . several possible reasons could explain this observation. residual replication might be due to the long cd <dig> half-life of approximately 20- <dig> hours on the cell surface  <cit>  when rapidly dividing cells lose the transiently transfected suicide vector pltbid2r-cd <dig>  we have observed that transiently transfected plasmids were not detectable anymore after a few cell divisions in hela ss <dig> cells . this would lead to the presence of cells which do not contain the suicide vector pltbid2r-cd <dig>  but still exhibit sufficient amounts of cd <dig> to promote hiv- <dig> entry and replication. it is known for a t cell-line adapted hiv- <dig> strain like nl4- <dig> that low cd <dig> expression does not impair virus replication  <cit> . it has also been described that cells lacking the ccr <dig> or cxcr <dig> receptor can be rendered ccr5+ or cxcr4+ by uptake of membrane-derived microparticles from ccr5- or cxcr4-positive cells  <cit> . there is evidence that cd4+ cells undergoing programmed cell death shed microparticles that carry cd <dig>  <cit> , offering another possibility of how co-cultured cells not expressing the cd <dig> antigen themselves could become infected after cd <dig> uptake.

the incomplete replication suppression might also be caused by differences in the levels and kinetics of hiv- <dig> tat and rev expression in the more physiological conditions using infectious virus particles  <cit> . a critical threshold level of rev is required for highly productive hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> . in contrast to the hiv- <dig> genome, pltbid2r-cd <dig> contains a duplication of the ins region. in the absence of rev, gene expression of gag/pol and env mrna is not completely inhibited in the context of wild-type hiv- <dig>  <cit> , but this ins duplication results in enhanced suppression of gene expression. thus, it might be that a threshold level of rev for sufficient expression of tbid was not reached in all cells by the infection. to address this concern, we are currently focusing on improving the pro-apoptotic properties of tbid by  introducing mutations that eliminate ubiquitin acceptor sites and thereby improve tbid's intracellular stability  <cit>  and by  modifying its n-terminal sequence to allow myristoylation of tbid, which promotes targeting to mitochondria and enhances pro-apoptotic activity in cell culture  <cit> . a similar low efficiency was recently described for replication-competent wild-type hiv- <dig> virions compared to single-cycle vsv-g pseudotyped hiv- <dig> virus particles in another investigation of a potential rev-dependent suicide vector  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown in three independent experimental settings that the induction of cell death by tbid in the context of our suicide vector pltbid2r is not leaky, occurs very rapidly, and is highly dependent on hiv- <dig>  furthermore, the production of virus particles and virus replication is substantially inhibited in cells transfected with the suicide vectors pltbid2r/-cd <dig>  thus, this vector system shows promise as a gene therapy vector.
