BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii  is an obligate intracellular, gram negative bacterium. it is the causative agent of q-fever. q-fever is a zoonosis with a worldwide distribution except new zealand that affects different animal species and humans. clinical presentation in humans ranges from mild flu-like symptoms to, sometimes, severe atypical pneumonia and hepatitis  <cit> . convalescence can be slow and endocarditis is the most frequent and serious manifestation of chronic q-fever  <cit> . in animals, primarily cattle, sheep, and goats, c. burnetii can cause abortion and infertility as it localizes in the female reproductive system. high doses of c. burnetii have been found in conception products of infected animals. the organism is shed in the urine, feces and milk of infected animals. in general infected animals remain asymptomatic. instead they often serve as the source of infection for humans via infective aerosols or contaminated dust  <cit> . c. burnetii is very resistant to environmental conditions and can remain infectious for a considerable time outside the host cell. recent outbreaks in france documented the high environmental stability of the organism when local q-fever epidemics were observed weeks after lambing season  <cit> . due to its high infectivity, environmental stability and its potential to cause severe disease in humans it is regarded as a category b biological weapon agent by the centers for disease control and prevention  <cit> . its natural widespread availability and potential for aerosolized use makes it considerably suitable as a biological weapon. proper administration of antibiotics can significantly reduce chronic q-fever associated mortality making timely diagnosis of utmost importance. for diagnosing c. burnetii infection serology remains the method of choice as it is easy to establish and widely applicable. however, antibodies are detected only after 2– <dig> weeks from the onset of disease  <cit>  making it too slow in selected clinical settings. a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  can be used for direct detection of c. burnetii  <cit> . however, its high limit of detection significantly reduces its reliability. direct detection of c. burnetii is also possible by cell culture, but this requires biosafety level-three laboratories. sensitivity of cell culture is sometimes low  <cit> . more recently, pcr has been successfully applied for the direct detection of c. burnetii in clinical specimens  <cit> . though it appears to be highly sensitive, conventional pcr protocols remain time-consuming due to laborious post pcr processing, and they are prone to cross-contamination. modern real-time pcr assays with in tube detection of amplicons decrease turn around time considerably  <cit> . in a bioterrorist event or in the case of local epidemics, masses of samples have to be expected. we have shown for other agents that real-time pcr provides the technical prerequisites for high throughput testing  <cit> .

here we describe a novel 5'nuclease  based real-time pcr assay for the rapid, sensitive and specific detection of c. burnetii. a mimic positive control monitors the reaction under the same conditions as applicable for c. burnetii, including use of the same primers. it identifies breaches in sensitivity in each single sample due to insufficient sample preparation, pcr inhibition or inherent failure of the pcr itself. to further facilitate high-throughput application a fully automated extraction procedure using the biorobot m <dig>  was evaluated and compared to an established manual sample preparation method.

RESULTS
coxiella burnetii real-time pcr
since the transposase gene of c. burnetii is present in approximately  <dig> copies per cell it was chosen as the target sequence. using primer express software two primer pairs and one 5'nuclease minor groove binder  probe were selected. prepared nucleic acid from a cultured c. burnetii  strain was used to optimize the assay. the  <dig> bp amplicon of the transposase gene was cloned into e. coli plasmids , and used for sensitivity determination. single copies were detected in limiting dilution series on an occasional basis. constantly positive results were obtained at a concentration of  <dig> copies per pcr reaction or more.

to monitor the sensitivity of the assay in each single reaction an internal control mimic dna was constructed next  <cit> . the probe binding site of pcoxquant was deleted and replaced by an alternative sequence to yield plasmid pcoxmimic. its corresponding 5'nuclease probe contained the dye vic for detection in a separate channel of the real-time pcr instrument. one copy of the internal control mimic pcoxmimic was occasionally and  <dig> copies constantly detectable. cross talk into the wild type channel was not observed. to exclude that the internal control affected the amplification efficiency of c. burnetii detection,  <dig> copies/reaction of pcoxquant were amplified in the presence of increasing numbers of pcoxmimic. the cycle threshold  values for pcoxquant and pcoxmimic were recorded separately for each target gene . the simultaneous amplification of up to  <dig> copies of internal control did not influence the ct for pcoxquant. only from  <dig> copies of internal control onward, variation and delay in ct for pcoxquant occurred. a concentration of  <dig> copies of pcoxmimic per reaction was chosen as a working concentration for all further experiments, in order to detect even slight drops in assay sensitivity. the exact limit of detection of real-time pcr was determined next. human edta blood was spiked with plasmid pcoxquant in five different concentrations. edta blood of each concentration was first extracted manually by means of a qiamp dna mini kit  in duplicates, and each duplicate was tested in replicates of  <dig> . prior to extraction the lysis buffer was spiked with pcoxmimic at a concentration corresponding to  <dig> copies per reaction. the observed proportions of positive results in each concentration were subjected to probit regression analysis .  <dig>  copies per ml were calculated to be detectable at ≥95% chance . this corresponded to  <dig> copies/pcr reaction.

for automated extraction, the biorobot m <dig>  was evaluated exactly in the same manner .  <dig>   copies per ml were calculated to be detectable with ≥95% chance, corresponding to  <dig> copies per pcr.

the internal control pcoxmimic was detected in all samples including the negative controls. specificity was evaluated by testing a number of viral and bacterial pathogens that might be present in human blood samples. none of the tested pathogens reacted positive with the c. burnetii real-time pcr assay . to further assess the specificity  <dig> different c. burnetii strains were subjected to the new real-time assay. as expected all strains reacted positive .

real-time pcr versus conventional pcr
to further assess the performance of real-time pcr we finally compared the assay to a conventional pcr. a total of  <dig> purified specimens were tested which were sampled during a follow-up study after a local q-fever epidemic in north-rhine westphalia. results are shown in table  <dig> and figure 2b. the mean ct value for samples positive in both assays was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  , which equals  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies per pcr . samples that were positive by real-time pcr only yielded a mean ct of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  , which equals  <dig> copies per pcr. means were significantly different .

quantitative real-time pcr
as an example of applicability the novel real-time pcr assay was evaluated in combination with the manual as well as the automated extraction procedure on a panel of samples. seventy-two homogenized tissue samples were purified using both extraction methods as described above. after purification of samples with the manual extraction method, 27/ <dig>  samples yielded a positive result by real-time pcr. with automated extraction 31/ <dig>  samples tested positive. the mean ct value in positive samples for each procedure was  <dig>  for the manual extraction and  <dig>  for the automated procedure, respectively . ct values correlated proportionally with dna concentrations, and showed good accordance between manual and automatic methods .

for absolute quantification a calibration curve was generated by limiting dilution series of plasmid pcoxquant. the amplification efficiency calculated from the calibration curve slope was  <dig> , indicating optimal pcr reaction condition. assuming  <dig> copies of target gene per genome, concentrations of c. burnetii per milliliter of homogenized sample ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> genomes per ml to  <dig>  ×  <dig> genomes per ml .

cell culture has long been regarded the gold standard for diagnosing c. burnetii infection. to re-assess its performance, all  <dig> samples were also subjected to cell culture. only  <dig> of  <dig>  samples yielded a positive result by cell culture. all cell culture positive samples yielded a positive real-time pcr result irrespective of the purification method. again the bacterial concentration per ml sample was determined and copy numbers of  <dig> real-time pcr positive samples were plotted in increasing increments and compared to cell culture results . only samples with > <dig> ×  <dig> genomes/ml of homogenized sample yielded a positive result by cell culture.

discussion
recent experience has shown that in the event of a c. burnetii epidemic masses of samples are to be expected  <cit> . we describe here a c. burnetii real-time pcr assay in combination with manual as well as fully automated extraction procedures for high-throughput use. the assay is capable of detecting single copies of c. burnetii transposase gene. this target region was chosen because it is highly conserved among c. burnetii strains and present at 10– <dig> copies per bacterium, making it an appropriate target for a diagnostic assay  <cit> . however, despite the assay was validated on a range of c. burnetii isolates, strains lacking elements of the transposase gene have been described  <cit> . for our calculations of sensitivity we assumed  <dig> copies per genome as present in our nine mile rsa  <dig> reference strain  <cit> . at  <dig>  dna copies/ml blood, the analytical sensitivity of our assay was close to what is possible due to mathematical limitations, according to the probit model  <cit> . this sensitivity, corresponding to about  <dig> genomes per ml, was as high as with commercial pcr systems available for other bacterial agents and should be compatible with the reliable detection of bacteremia  <cit> . of note, since the number of copies of the c. burnetii transposase gene can vary greatly different sensitivities have to be expected with other strains.

due to increased hybridization properties and lower background fluorescence we decided to use a minor groove binder  probe in combination with a non-fluorescent-quencher   <cit> . the use of a nfq improves the signal-to-noise ratio and decreases spectral overlap compared to other fluorescent quencher dyes e.g. tamra  <cit> . this feature facilitates double dye detection, which allows implementation of a stable internal control system. the internal control was detected in all negative samples irrespective of the extraction procedure, although only a low amount of internal control mimic was added . since the internal control is almost identical to the c. burnetii target gene including additional positive controls is not necessary. the advantages of such controls have already been described and implemented in various assays  <cit> .

besides the pcr itself, the extraction procedure constitutes another crucial factor in molecular diagnostics. it is the lengthiest part of the whole procedure and automation is highly desirable especially in a high-throughput setting. the most valuable advantage of robotic systems is their speed when numerous samples have to be analyzed  <cit> . however, there is little data on the performance of automated systems in diagnostic settings. in this study the limit of detection of the automated procedure was only  <dig>  times higher than that of the manual protocol . assuming  <dig> copies per bacterium  the limit of detection for the automated procedure was around  <dig> c. burnetii bacteria per ml . high sensitivity and good quantitative correlation with other extraction methods is in concordance with our earlier study on the automated extraction of b. anthracis  <cit> .

the novel assay yielded more positive results than conventional pcr upon testing of a large panel of stored samples of animal origin. however, it should be noted that  <dig>  times more template was added to the real-time pcr reaction. because pcr negative/real-time pcr positive samples had significantly lower ct values than samples positive in both methods, improved analytical sensitivity can be assumed for real-time pcr. of note  <dig> conventional pcr positive samples remained repeatedly negative upon real-time pcr testing. all of these  <dig> samples were stored for approximately  <dig> years at -20°c and reported to be weakly positive only by conventional pcr. due to prolonged storage it seems likely that some dna degradation had happened thus preventing positive results by real-time pcr.

critically, classical isolation of c. burnetii by cell culture showed rather disappointing results. henning and sting have already reported similar results for cell culture  <cit> . the strain of c. burnetii as well as its source might account for the here observed rather low number of conventional cell culture positive results. more sensitive isolation methods like shell vial technique or inoculation of specimens into guinea pigs or mice were not available in our laboratory. by quantitative pcr we could show that rather high bacterial loads are necessary for cell culture to become positive. for this reason and because of the associated biological risks, cell culture is not the method of choice in the first run. however, it remains an essential tool for further pathogen characterization, and allows isolation of related agents which would go undetected by pcr.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this assay provides a homogenous tool for diagnostics in human and veterinary medicine. since c. burnetii infection is still not well understood, quantitative pcr may yield new insights into the pathogenesis of the disease. another future field of application of high throughput assays may comprise the screening of bulk milk samples, an issue which may be addressed by food safety authorities.
