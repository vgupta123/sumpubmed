BACKGROUND
genomes are under constant threat of damage from exogenous factors and endogenous processes that result in dna lesions. correspondingly, cells have evolved elaborate dna damage response  mechanisms to maintain genome integrity and stability  <cit> . ddr integrates the dna-repair process with the cell cycle regulation, chromatin dynamics and programmed cell death, requiring delicate coordination of hundreds of genes  <cit> . because dna damage underlies the onset of cancer, aging, immune deficiencies, and other degenerative diseases, urgent needs of public health have made ddr a major target of study for decades  <cit> .

ddr is highly conserved during evolution. essential components of the ddr network, including atm/atr pathway, non-homologous ends joining  and homologous recombination  repair, share homologues among almost all the eukaryotes  <cit> . therefore, studies of the ddr in lower eukaryotes can provide valuable information to elucidate the mechanism in higher organisms. because of their experimental amenabilities, budding yeast  and fission yeast  have become excellent models for ddr research  <cit> . fission yeast separated from budding yeast about  <dig>  million years ago during evolution. s. pombe contains about  <dig> metazoan-homologous genes which can’t be found in s. cerevisiae, and a similar number is seen when this comparison is made for s. cerevisiae. this emphasizes the advantage of using both yeasts for basic studies  <cit> . with the completion of the saccharomyces genome deletion project in  <dig>  genome-wide screens using a deletion library have become an effective way to identify novel genes involved in ddr  <cit> . using such systematic screens, scientists have discovered  <dig> genes required for repairing dna lesions caused by mms  <cit> ,  <dig> genes involved in ddr to uv  <cit> , and  <dig> new loci that influence sensitivity to γ radiation  <cit> . a haploid deletion library of s. pombe was created by korea research institute of biotechnology and bioscience and supplied by bioneer corporation . this commercial library facilitates the genome-wide screen in fission yeast. by using this library, colleagues identified  <dig> genes relevant to ddr, among which  <dig> genes were previously uncharacterized  <cit> . following, an upgraded library was applied to investigate the global fitness of deletions after different kinds of dna damage by barcode sequencing  <cit> . both studies made impressive progress to gain a better understanding of ddr. however, the deletion libraries applied in these studies only covered around 70% of non-essential s. pombe genes. in this sense, screening a deletion library with a higher coverage of genes seemed worthwhile in order to build a more comprehensive ddr network.

in this study, we screened a s. pombe haploid deletion library, containing  <dig>  deletions, against six different dna damage reagents. the library represented approximately  <dig> % of non-essential genes in the genome.  <dig> genes were identified to be closely related with ddr,  <dig> of which were reported for the first time. we characterized six novel ddr genes by flow cytometry and microarray analysis. data suggest these genes might function in dna replication and cytokinesis, providing a basis for further characterization of their roles in ddr.

RESULTS
genome-wide screen of dna damage sensitive mutants
six chemical reagents that can cause different kinds of dna damage were chosen for the screen. hydroxyurea  inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, depletes nucleotides pool and thus leads to an s-phase arrest  <cit> . bleomycin , a mimetic of gamma irradiation, causes double-strand breaks  <cit> . methyl methanesulfonate , an alkylating agent, primarily methylates dna on n7-deoxyguanine and n3-deoxyadenine, leading to dna synthesis defects  <cit> . camptothecin  locks topoisomerase i covalently onto the dna and thus causes strand breaks during s phase  <cit> . ultraviolent radiation  results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases  <cit> . thiabendazole  depolymerizes the microtubule and was used to check the integrity of the spindle checkpoint  <cit> . before the screen was performed, the growth of wt cells with different concentrations of dna damaging agents were monitored. the highest concentration that did not affect the growth of wt cells was chosen for large scale screen. by using this concentration, it was easier to compare the growth with wt cells and to pick the sensitive mutants.

the screen was carried out in three rounds. first,  <dig>  deletions were exposed to each dna damage reagent in 96-well microtiter plates.  <dig> mutants showing sensitivities to at least one reagent were picked to create a sub-library. in the second round, mutants from the sub-library were grown in test-tubes to repeat the sensitivity assays, and  <dig> sensitive deletions were obtained . in the last round of the screen,  <dig> deletions were subjected to spot assays to quantify the sensitivities. we found that deletion of  <dig> genes caused viability to decrease by  <dig> fold or more upon treatment of at least one reagent, suggesting those genes play important roles in ddr .

among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  were identified in previous large-scale screens  <cit> , and  <dig> genes  in total have been reported to be related with ddr, which validates the accuracy of our screen . for example, genes directly involved in sensing and repairing dna damage were identified. proteins encoded by these genes include: rad <dig> and rad <dig>  two subunits of a checkpoint complex   <cit> ; crb <dig>  rep <dig> and ulp <dig>  proteins required for cell cycle control  <cit> ; rhp <dig>  sen <dig> and srs <dig>  proteins involved in dna double strand break  and single strand break  repair  <cit> . as expected, deletions of these genes were sensitive to a broad range of dna damage reagents . genes involved in spindle assembly and cytokinesis were also obtained, including dad5+, atb2+, mad1+, pab1+, myo1+ and scd1+ <cit> . as expected, deletions of these genes exhibited sensitivity to tbz, a microtubule depolymerizing agent . chromatin controls the accessibility of the dna repair machinery, and thus it was not surprised to identify genes related to the dynamics of chromatin structure. such proteins included set <dig> and ash <dig>  subunits of a histone h3k <dig> methyltransferase complex  <cit> ; clr <dig> and swi <dig>  subunits of an h3k <dig> methyltransferase  <cit> ; gcn <dig>  sgf <dig> and spt <dig>  subunits of the saga histone acetylase complex  <cit> ; pst <dig>  a component of clr <dig> deacetylase complex  <cit> ; snf <dig>  a subunit of the swi/snf remodeling complex  <cit> ; pht <dig>  a histone h2a variant  <cit> . these results stress the importance of histone modification and chromatin remodeling in ddr. spbc <dig> , sec65+, tcg1+, cch1+ and spac19a <dig> c were identified previously during other genome-wide screens  <cit> . identification by our screen confirmed the relevance of these genes to ddr. however, several known ddr genes identified in the previous large scale screens, including ctp1+, rhp51+, rad32+, rad26+, pnk1+, rad3+, hus1+, rad17+, rad24+, rhp57+ <cit> , were not screened out in this study. this might be caused by different screen strategy, different choice of dna damaging agents and their working concentrations. besides, the commercial library we used contained errors. we checked the mutants of several known ddr genes and found rhp51Δ, rad26Δ, rad3Δ were wrong. therefore, the quality of the library also affected the results of our screen.

on the other hand, another  <dig> genes were found to be linked with ddr for the first time in this study, and the identities of corresponding mutants have been double checked. among  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes have been already identified to function in different biological processes, including biosynthesis, rna processing, stress response, transport and chromatin modification. notably, deletion of trk1+, a gene encoding the potassium ion transporter, caused strong sensitivity to almost all the dna damage reagents used in our assay  <cit> . there was no assigned function for the remaining  <dig> genes; they were classified as “sequence orphan”, “conserved hypothetical” or “role inferred from homolog”. our data provided novel functional annotations for these unknown genes. interestingly, deletion of psl1+ and spac19a <dig> c caused sensitivity to only one reagent, suggesting these genes are required for repairing a specific dna lesion.

among these  <dig> novel ddr genes,  <dig> genes have homologues in s. cerevisiae. notably, deletion of  <dig> homologous genes are sensitive to dna damage reagents in s. cerevisiae , which reflects the functional conservation of these ddr genes in fungi  <cit> .

* listed are the dna damage reagents that deletion of s. cerevisiae genes are sensitive to.

cell cycle analysis of dna damage sensitive mutants
s. pombe genome is extensively annotated using terms from the gene ontology consortium , with  <dig> % of its genes having at least one go  annotation  <cit> . the go term classification of  <dig> genes was carried out with a significance level smaller than  <dig>  , and representative go terms were shown in figure  <dig>  this analysis revealed that the  <dig> genes were significantly enriched in cell cycle and chromatin related processes. as the most over-represented go term, “cell cycle” was annotated to  <dig> % of genes . cell cycle control is one of the essential components of the ddr network  <cit> . after dna damage, the cell cycle is delayed by checkpoint to provide an opportunity for repair. to monitor the cell cycle change in the deletions upon dna damage, the dna content of  <dig> mutants was analyzed by flow cytometry .

as expected,  <dig> deletions exhibited abnormal cell cycle profiles after dna damage. no change was observed for the remaining  <dig> mutants, probably due to insufficient time for treatment. based on flow cytometry phenotypes without reagent treatment, the  <dig> mutants could be divided into four groups which were designated as “2c”, “1c”, “w4c” and “s4c”, respectively . representative cytometry data of each group are shown in figure 2a. “2c” stands for 2c dna content. members of this group,  <dig> deletions in total, exhibited dna content peaks at 2c without reagent treatment, the same as wt cells. however, peaks moved towards 1c upon dna damage caused by hu or mms, suggesting that these deletions can cause replication arrest in response to damage . the concentration of hu was the critical concentration that did not cause replication arrest of wt cells . in the “1c” group, including  <dig> members, dna content peaks moved towards 1c without treatment . this result suggested that these deletions might have a defect in dna replication  <cit> . eight mutants in the “w4c” group and  <dig> mutants in the “s4c” group exhibited peaks of 4c dna content  where “w” stands for “weak”, as the 4c content was less than 35% and “s” represents “strong”, because the 4c content was above 80%. cytometry phenotypes suggested members of both groups had undergone diploidization, and the situation was much more severe in the “s4c” group. genome duplication could be caused by dna re-replication, a chromosome segregation defect, or improper cytokinesis  <cit> . possible reasons for diploidization in the deletions will be discussed in the following section. quantifications of the 1c, 2c and 4c dna contents in  <dig> mutants are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

gene expression profiling of mutants
we selected  <dig> typical mutants from each cytometry phenotype group for further characterization . all deletions showed strong sensitivity to at least two different dna damage reagents . spac3f <dig> , spbc2a <dig> , spac27d <dig> c and meu29+ were uncharacterized ddr genes. ash2+, sgf73+, sec65+ and pab1+ were identified during a previous global screen, but their detailed roles in ddr had not been identified yet  <cit> . for a better understanding of the gene function, we performed a dna microarray assay to analyze the gene expression profiles of these eight deletions  <cit> . transcription levels of hundreds of genes changed by 2-fold or more in the mutants. notably, differentially regulated genes were enriched in the process related to dna replication and cytokinesis. representative genes are listed in table  <dig>  analysis of microarray data by hierarchical clustering clustered  <dig> mutants into  <dig> groups . notably, clustering perfectly matched the classification based on the flow cytometry phenotypes. it suggested that both genes from each group might function in the same pathway to regulate ddr and cell cycle progression.

differentially regulated genes in the deletions comparing to wt were analyzed using an affymetrix microarray. genes relevant to dna replication and cytokinesis are listed. the number represents the ratio of mrna level in the deletion relative to that in wt.

abp1+ and abp2+ function downstream of spbc2a <dig>  and spac27d <dig> c to initiate dna replication
as members of the “1c” group, spbc2a <dig> Δ or spac27d <dig> cΔ exhibited a discrete 1c dna peak, suggesting g <dig> arrest and a defect in replication initiation  <cit> . consistently, both mutants displayed a growth defect on emm plates . both microarray and real-time pcr analysis revealed that the expression levels of abp1+ and abp2+ were simultaneously down-regulated by more than 2-fold in both deletions . abp <dig> and abp <dig> are ars  binding proteins and are required for initiation of dna replication  <cit> . it is possible that down-regulation of abp1+ and abp2+ contributed to the replication defects observed in spbc2a <dig> Δ and spac27d <dig> cΔ. to check this possibility, we overexpressed abp1+ and abp2+ in the deletions. without dna damage, the growth defects of spbc2a <dig> Δ and spac27d <dig> cΔ were partially rescued by overexpression of abp1+ and abp2+ . the improvement was more obvious in the case of spac27d <dig> cΔ, and was relatively mild, nevertheless, observable in the case of spbc2a <dig> Δ. in face of dna damage, overexpressing either abp1+ and abp2+ could significantly improve the growth of spbc2a <dig> Δ and spac27d <dig> cΔ . correspondingly, g1-arrest in spac27d <dig> cΔ could also be reproducibly relieved by overexpression of both abp1+ and abp2+ . the data suggested that abp1+ and abp2+ function downstream of spbc2a <dig>  and spac27d <dig> c to ensure the proper initiation of dna replication under normal circumstances or after dna damage.

members of “w4c” and “s4c” groups exhibited defects in cytokinesis and replication
deletions from the “w4c” and “s4c” groups exhibited discrete peaks of 4c dna content, suggesting the mutants underwent diploidization. diploidization in s. pombe is commonly caused by a defect in cytokinesis. correspondingly, microscopic analysis revealed abnormal morphological changes in these mutants . wt cells were rod-shaped and contained a single nucleus, or double nuclei separated by a sharp septum. in contrast, mutant cells exhibited elongated cell length , multiple nuclei , thick septum  or multiple septa , resembling typical defects in cytokinesis  <cit> . as expected, all  <dig> deletions displayed strong sensitivity to tbz, a microtubule depolymerizing agent  <cit> . microarray and real-time pcr analysis showed that the expressions of several cytokinesis related genes were up-regulated in the mutants, including those of ace2+, agn1+ and eng1+ . ace <dig> is a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes required for cell separation, while eng1+ and agn1+ are both targets of ace <dig>  eng <dig>  a β-glucanase, degrades the primary division septum between the new ends of daughter cells. agn <dig>  an α-glucanase, hydrolyses the old cell wall surrounding the septum and leads to full separation of daughter cells  <cit> . the data suggest that deletion of sgf73+, meu29+, sec65+ or pab1+ delays proper progression of cytokinesis, while a ruptured cell wall constitutively generates a signal to activate the ace <dig> pathway and up-regulate target genes  <cit> .

on the other hand, diploidization could also result from dna re-replication during one cell cycle. consistent with this idea, expression levels of cdc18+ and cdt1+ were up-regulated in all  <dig> mutants . presence of cdc <dig> and cdt <dig> at pre-rcs  is important for efficient dna replication initiation, and inactivation of these proteins after initiation is crucial to ensure only one round of dna replication in each cell cycle. overexpression of cdc18+ and cdt1+ in fission yeast causes replication origins to re-fire, and drive re-replication of dna sequences genome-wide  <cit> . therefore, up-regulation of cdc18+ and cdt1+ in sgf73Δ, meu29Δ, sec65Δ and pab1Δ might lead to dna re-replication, and that contributes to the observed diploidization. meanwhile, disturbed replication initiation probably compromises ddr during early s phase. correspondingly, all the members in “w4c” and “s4c” groups showed strong sensitivities to hu.

discussion
in this study, six reagents were applied in the screen and they can cause different kinds of dna damage. the screen revealed six genes whose deletions displayed strong sensitivities to five reagents, including rad1+, rhp55+, ulp2+, pst2+, mlo3+ and trk1+ . broad sensitivities to different dna damage reagents suggest that these genes function in the universal pathway of ddr, for example, in the conserved atm/atr pathway  <cit> . as expected, rad1+ plays a role in the atr pathway, and rhp55+ in the atm pathway  <cit> . ulp2+, encoding a sumo protease, is required for cell division after termination of the dna damage checkpoint  <cit> . the high sensitivity of ulp2Δ to a broad range of dna damage reagents emphasizes the importance of silencing of the dna damage checkpoint and restart of the cell cycle. pst2+ encodes a subunit of the clr <dig> histone deacetylase. deletion of pst2+ could lead to hyperacetylation of histones and down-regulation of histone h <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation, resulting in abnormal chromosome condensation and a defect in dna damage repair  <cit> . identification of pst2+ during the screen indicates the importance of chromatin condensation and decondensation in ddr. the protein encoded by mlo3+ was required for export and quality control of mrna  <cit> , suggesting ddr is related to the level and quality of mrna. the screen has revealed the novel link between ddr and trk1+, gene encoding a potassium ion transporter  <cit> . two calcium transporter genes, cch1+, and pmr1+, have also been identified in this study. cch1+, along with other ion transporter genes, including zrg17+, fep1+, ctr4+ and zhf1+, were identified during previous global screens for ddr genes  <cit> .these results imply a close connection between ion transport and ddr. ion transport controls several crucial physiological parameters, including membrane potential and ion balance  <cit> . it will be intriguing to uncover the mechanism how ion transport influences the ddr in future studies.

the screen also identified genes whose deletion exhibited sensitivity to only one kind of dna damage reagent. characterization of these genes will help to elucidate the specific ddr for a certain dna lesion. for example, deletion of psl1+ displayed specific sensitivity to mms. previous screens have identified similar genes, including cac2+, mag1+, rev3+ and slx4+ <cit> . these genes, along with psl1+, might work together to remove the damage caused by alkylated dna. spac19a <dig> cΔ caused exclusive sensitivity to blm. blm abstracts a hydrogen atom from dna deoxyribose and causes alkali-labile sites in dna  <cit> . genomic screen in budding yeast identified  <dig> genes exhibiting specific sensitivity to blm  <cit> . spac19a <dig> c might be an additional gene needed to repair lesions caused by blm.

cell cycle is delayed by checkpoints in response to dna damage, thus providing a chance to repair dna lesions. several dna damage checkpoints have been described in s. pombe, including g2-m, intra-s, s-m, g1-m and g1-s checkpoints  <cit> . among the  <dig> deletion identified in this study,  <dig> deletions were found to affect cell cycle progression. notably,  <dig> deletions in the “2c” group caused replication arrest upon treatment with hu or mms. it suggested that these genes might be involved in dna damage repair in s phase. failures of repairing lesions in the deletions might persist intra-s checkpoint and slow the replication. another member of “2c”, myo1Δ caused a 4c peak of dna content after treatment of tbz, indicating the diploidization of the genome. since myo <dig> regulates the assembly of actin and contributes to proper septation, observed diploidiation might be caused by a cytokinesis defect in myo1Δ  <cit> .

in contrast to the “2c” group, deletions in the “1c” group caused g <dig> or s phase arrest without dna damage. the data suggest these genes are required for cell cycle progression. these deletions interfere with cell cycle regulation in response to dna damage, thus leading to high sensitivity to damage reagents. further investigation revealed that spbc2a <dig>  and spac27d <dig> c might function in the initiation of dna replication through initiation factors, abp <dig> and abp <dig>  since deletion of spbc2a <dig>  and spac27d <dig> c share a similar cytometry phenotype and gene expression profiling, it is likely both genes work in the same pathway. spac27d <dig> c contains a methyltransferase  <dig> domain, harboring potential sam-dependent methyltransferase activity . it suggests that spac27d <dig> c might regulate replication by methylating downstream proteins.

flow cytometry analysis indicated that the members of “s4c” and “w4c” groups underwent diploidization. gene expression and microscopic analysis of sgf73Δ, meu29Δ, sec65Δ and pab1Δ suggested diploidization might be caused by a cytokinesis defect and dna re-replication. it is possible that proteins encoded by these genes function as subunits of large complexes, involved in the regulations of different processes, including replication, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. a similar case was reported for a subunit of the orc complex, orc <dig>  <cit> . consistent with this idea, sgf <dig> is a subunit of the saga complex, a conserved multifunctional co-activator  <cit> . saga complex is known to regulate transcriptional activation, transcription elongation and mrna export  <cit> . however, its roles in dna re-replication and cytokinesis are yet to be identified. recently, pab <dig> has been revealed to be a novel component of the septation initiation network  complex  <cit> . sin plays an important role in cytokinesis  <cit> . whether the sin complex also contributes to the replication initiation needs further characterization. notably, pab1+, along with other  <dig> genes from the “w4c” group , is conserved from s. pombe to mammals. thus, further characterization of these genes is expected to provide valuable information for studies of genome stability and ddr in higher eukaryotes, especially in human.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide screening is a fast and efficient way to explore unknown genes, clarify signaling pathways, and to ultimately build a comprehensive gene network. in this study, we performed a systematic screen of the s. pombe deletion library to uncover genes involved in ddr.  <dig> genes were characterized, among which  <dig> genes were linked to ddr for the first time. most of the genes take part in cell cycle control, dna repair, chromatin dynamics and dna replication, all of which are well-known components of ddr  <cit> . in addition, many novel genes functioning in biosynthesis, transport, rna processing and stress response were uncovered, suggesting their substantial contributions to ddr. further characterizations suggested  <dig> novel genes might function in ddr through dna replication and cytokinesis. our study introduces new members to the long list of ddr genes and provides new clues to clarify the dynamic ddr network .
