BACKGROUND
in dna microarray experiments, discovering groups of genes that share similar transcriptional characteristics is instrumental in functional annotation, tissue classification and motif identification  <cit> . in many situations, an interesting cellular process is active only under a subset of conditions, or a single gene may participate in multiple pathways that may or may not be co-active under all conditions  <cit> . in addition, the data to be analyzed often include many heterogeneous conditions from many experiments. in these instances, it is often unrealistic to require that related genes behave similarly across all measured conditions and conventional clustering algorithms, such as the k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms  <cit>  and the self-organizing map  <cit> , often cannot produce a satisfactory solution.

when a subset of genes shares similar transcriptional characteristics only across a subset of measures, the conventional algorithm may fail to uncover useful information between them. in fig. 1a, we see a data matrix clustered using the hierarchical clustering algorithm, where no coherent pattern can be observed by naked eyes. however, fig. 1b indicates that an interesting pattern actually exists within the data if we rearrange the data appropriately.

the hidden pattern in fig. 1b is called a bicluster. one of the criteria to evaluate a biclustering algorithm is what kind of bicluster patterns an algorithm is able to find. in this paper, we address six major classes of numerical biclusters. fig.  <dig> shows different patterns that are of interest to us:  constant values,  constant rows,  constant columns,  additive coherent values, where each row or column is obtained by adding a constant to another row or column,  multiplicative coherent values, where each row or column is obtained by multiplying another row or column by a constant value, and  linear coherent values, where each column is obtained by multiplying another column by a constant value and then adding a constant. among these patterns, the first  <dig> patterns have been introduced by madeira and oliveira  <cit> . patterns  are compatible to  or , in the sense that an algorithm which can detect additive patterns can also detect constant rows/column since the latter are two special cases of the former, while  and  are mutually independent. most existing algorithms are based on either the additive model  or the multiplicative model . the linear coherent pattern of  is a generalization proposed by us and subsumes all patterns in fig.  <dig>  these patterns can be more easily understood based on our geometric perspective introduced below.

in this work, we deal with numerical biclusters only. there are also works  <cit>  that focus on biclusters containing symbolic data or the so-called coherent evolution biclusters, where the evolution  of the elements in a numerical data matrix is considered instead of the numerical values themselves. we choose to focus on the numerical data based on the following considerations. first, a numerical biclustering algorithm can be used to analyze symbolic data by assigning appropriate numerical values to the symbols. second, many gene expression data analysis tasks, such as gene regulation network analysis, require numerical biclustering results.

previous work on biclustering
throughout the paper, we use f ∈ ℜn × m to denote a gene expression data matrix with n genes and m arrays or experiment conditions. in the matrix f, a row fi ∈ ℜ <dig> × m represents the expression of the gene i in m arrays. for simplicity, we only introduce biclustering algorithm for constant/coherent rows below, the corresponding algorithm for constant/coherent columns is similar and can be easily deduced.

bicluster of constant values is obviously the simplest type. a bicluster of constant values can be modeled as

  f = uij + ε, 

where uij is the typical value of the bicluster and ε is a small perturbation. hartigan  <cit>  split the original matrix into a predetermined set of submatrices, and use the variance to evaluate each submatrix var=∑i∈i,j∈jf−uij to determine whether a bicluster should be accepted.

if the noise is additive, a bicluster of constant rows can be modeled as

 f = uij + fi + ε. 

where fi is the i-th row offset. the straightforward method to detect a bicluster of constant row is to normalize the rows of the bicluster using the row mean. by doing so, a bicluster of constant row can be transformed into a bicluster of constant values and hence becomes detectable using algorithms for biclusters of constant values. getz et al.  <cit>  have developed a method based on this consideration and even extended it to detect biclusters of coherent values. however, methods based on data normalization have a dilemma: for a good normalization, we need to estimate the parameter fi for each row of a bicluster. however, for an accurate estimate of fi, we need to know the location of a bicluster, which is exactly the problem we need to solve. the noise ε in the data further complicates the estimation of fi. instead of relying on data normalization, califano et al.  <cit>  have developed a method to find some small biclusters first with each row satisfying

 max) - min) <δ, ∀j ∈ j 

and then add additional rows or columns into it to produce a bicluster that is as large as possible. sheng et al.  <cit>  have assumed that the multinomial distributions for different columns in a bicluster are mutually independent and used the gibbs sampling for parameter estimation.

a bicluster of additive coherent values with additive noise can be modeled as

  f = uij + fi + gj + ε. 

cheng and church  <cit>  are the first who applied biclustering to microarray data analysis. in their method, the mean squared residue 1|i||j|∑i∈i,j∈jε <dig> in  is minimized. cho et al.  <cit>  have improved this mean-squared-residue based method by using the variance as the second measure. lazzeronic and owen  <cit>  have introduced a plaid model and proposed the general additive model to identify biclusters of constant rows, constant columns and additive coherent values. prelic et al.  <cit>  have compared many biclustering algorithms using the additive model.

a bicluster of multiplicative coherent values with additive noise can be modeled as

  f = uij × fi × gj + ε 

kluger et al.  <cit>  have studied the checkerboard structure of this type of biclusters using a normalization scheme based on the above equation. tang et al.  <cit>  have developed a method to compute the cosine value of the angle between each normalized row vector and a predefined stable pattern and then measure the similarity between two rows or two columns. getz et al.  <cit>  have introduced the couple two-way clustering by repeatedly performing one-way clustering on the rows and columns of the data matrix.

madeira and oliveira  <cit>  are the first to classify many existing numerical biclustering algorithms systematically based on the additive and multiplicative bicluster models. it should be pointed out that some symbolic, coherent evolution or numerical biclusters, such as those produced by cmonkey  <cit> , samba  <cit>  and some statistical criteria, cannot be classified as additive or multiplicative patterns directly. for example, in cmonkey, additional information besides the usual gene expression value, such as motif co-occurrence and association network relationships, are taken into account. moreover, cmonkey attempts to ensure that a greater percentage of genes that are observed in the data set are included in at least one cluster, while reducing redundancy between overlapping biclusters and maximizing the number of conditions that are included in each bicluster. these features cannot be modeled directly using the additive and multiplicative coherent patterns.

although the classification into additive or multiplicative patterns is not perfect, it is nevertheless applicable to many existing biclustering algorithms, which can all be formulated using the general linear model proposed in this paper. in fact, in most biclustering algorithms that deal with expression values only, the underlying theme is the coherency in expression values within the biclusters. our general linear model of fig.  <dig> therefore conveniently captures the zero and first order coherent relationships within a bicluster.

a high-dimensional geometric method for biclustering
as pointed out in  <cit> , existing approaches are often based on searching for sub-matrices within a data matrix by optimizing certain heuristically defined merit functions. obviously, the form of the merit function depends greatly on the bicluster pattern to be uncovered. in these methods, when the data contain different types of biclusters, multiple merit functions or different data normalizations or transformations are needed. this often results in a high computational complexity and the optimization procedure is np-hard in general can be easily trapped at a local optimal point.

in this paper, we extend our previous work  <cit>  and present a novel perspective for biclustering problem through a geometric interpretation. such a new perspective allows us to regard biclusters with different coherent patterns as hyperplanes in a high dimensional space, and facilitates the use of any generic plane finding algorithm for detecting them. the geometric viewpoint of our approach provides a unified framework to handle different types of linear patterns simultaneously by matching a specific set of linear geometries. it also reveals the existence of the general linear model, which can unify the additive and the multiplicative models. as a particular realization of our framework, we implemented a hough transform-based hyperplane detection algorithm. the experimental results on human lymphoma gene expression dataset show that our algorithm is highly effective for gene expression data biclustering.

RESULTS
we tested our algorithm using synthetic dataset and human lymphoma dataset. for synthetic dataset, we use a test model proposed in  <cit> , but deal with both additive and multiplicative biclusters. in the gibbs sampling method  <cit> , only additive biclusters are used. for human lymphoma dataset, we detect biclusters based on additive, multiplicative and general linear models, and investigate whether the detected biclusters are biological meaningful. our experiments show that the proposed linear coherent model can produce biologically significant groups enriched by the genes in biclusters.

synthetic dataset
we generated a synthetic dataset containing four overlapping biclusters of constant columns, constant rows, and multiplicative coherent values, and tested the ability of our approach to detect these patterns simultaneously. to test noise resistance of our method, we embedded the biclusters into a noisy background generated by a uniform distribution u. gaussian noise with variance of  <dig>  was used to degrade the biclusters. the dataset has  <dig> rows by  <dig> columns, and the embedded biclusters have the following sizes :  <dig> ×  <dig> for bicluster  <dig> of constant row,  <dig> ×  <dig> for bicluster  <dig> of constant column, and  <dig> ×  <dig> for bicluster  <dig> of constant column,  <dig> ×  <dig> for bicluster  <dig> of multiplicative coherent values with the multiplicative coefficients for each row given in fig. 3g. as shown in the main plot of fig. 3a, bicluster  <dig> overlaps with bicluster  <dig> in two columns, and bicluster  <dig> overlaps with bicluster  <dig> in five rows and three columns. random row and column permutations are then performed in fig. 3a to obtain the final test dataset.

in this experiment, the three biclusters contain additive coherent values, and both the gibbs sampling method  <cit>  and our algorithm can identify all of them, but with different accuracies. the gibbs sampling method misses  <dig> genes in bicluster  <dig> and  <dig> genes in bicluster  <dig>  whereas our algorithm detects all genes perfectly . interestingly, a new bicluster with  <dig> conditions and  <dig> rows was also reported by our method . this bicluster is located in the overlap region of biclusters  <dig> and  <dig> and comprises of last three columns of bicluster  <dig> and first three columns of bicluster  <dig> and all rows of the two biclusters. although unexpected, this is a reasonable result since the extra bicluster detected is a valid bicluster by itself. in contrast, the gibbs sampling method fails to detect this extra, but valid bicluster. the detection of this new bicluster further shows the efficacy of our algorithm in handling overlapping biclusters.

biological data: human lymphoma dataset
we apply our algorithm to the lymphoma dataset  <cit> . this dataset is characterized by well defined expression patterns differentiating three types of lymphoma: diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and follicular lymphoma. the dataset consists of expression data from  <dig> lymphochip microarrays for  <dig> genes in  <dig> normal and malignant lymphocyte samples. missing values in the dataset are imputed using pocsimpute  <cit> .

we compare our algorithm with six existing algorithms, i.e., opsm  <cit> , bimax  <cit> , iterative signature algorithm, isa  <cit> , samba  <cit> , cheng and church's algorithm, cc  <cit>  and xmotif  <cit> , using the procedure proposed by prelic et al.  <cit> . since most existing numerical biclustering algorithms do not detect biclusters with general linear coherent values, we only compare the performance for the additive model. similar to the validation method proposed by tanay et al.  <cit> , we investigate whether the gene groups produced by different algorithms show significant enrichment with respect to a specific gene ontology  annotation. we know that biclustering algorithms aim to classify the genes involved in the same molecular function or biological process into a group, so a better biclustering algorithm can find more or larger groups that show significant enrichment. specifically, in our experiment, biclusters are evaluated by computing the hyper-geometric functional enrichment score  <cit>  based on the go biological process annotations, and the resulting scores are adjusted for multiple testing using the westfall and young procedure  <cit> .

the histogram in fig.  <dig> presents the proportion of biclusters produced by each method for which one or more go categories are overrepresented at different levels of significance. best results are obtained from opsm and the proposed algorithm. our algorithm is very competitive even when we only consider additive biclusters.

our method is also capable of detecting biclusters with general linear coherent values. fig. 5a shows one of these biclusters detected in the lymphoma dataset. the linearity amongst the columns in this bicluster is verified using the scatter plots in fig. 5b and a good fit can be observed. by defining the column of this bicluster as f <dig>  f <dig>  ..., f <dig>  the pattern of this bicluster can be expressed as f <dig> =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig>  =  <dig> f <dig> -  <dig> . the detailed results from the gotermfinder at significance level of 5% are provided in fig.  <dig>  the result from the go analysis shows that these linear coherent biclusters are indeed biological meaningful.

in additional file  <dig>  we provide the algorithmic parameters used in the experiment for the lymphoma dataset. in our experiment, more than  <dig> biclusters are detected. in additional file  <dig>  we provide a list of all biclusters with  <dig> showing corresponding genes/arrays covered by the bicluster while  <dig> is the contrary. in additional file  <dig>  we selected  <dig> biclusters as an example for go annotation. all the biclusters with full data are given in additional file  <dig>  the full-sized image of fig. 5a is shown in additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed the different type of numerical biclusters and proposed a general linear coherent bicluster model that effectively captures the zero and first order coherent relationships within a bicluster. then, we presented a novel interpretation of the biclustering problem in terms of the geometric distributions of data points in a high dimensional data space. in this perspective, the biclustering problem becomes that of detecting structures of known linear geometries, i.e., hyperplanes, in the high dimensional data space. we have shown that many common types of bicluster are just different spatial arrangements of the hyperplanes in the high dimensional data space. this novel perspective allows us to perform biclustering geometrically using a hyperplane detection algorithm. the experiment results on both synthetic and real gene expression datasets have demonstrated that our algorithm is very effective.
