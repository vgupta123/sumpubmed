BACKGROUND
non-heading chinese cabbage  is a species belonging to the brassica genus of cruciferae family, which contains  <dig> genera and over  <dig>  species, including the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . in  <dig>  the production of brassica vegetables reached  <dig>  million tons worldwide . the six widely cultivated brassica are described by the classical and famous “u’s triangle”, which includes three diploid species, b. rapa , brassica nigra , brassica oleracea , and three allopolyploid species, brassica juncea , brassica napus  and brassica carinata   <cit> . brassica rapa contains several subspecies such as chinese cabbage , nhcc and turnip   <cit> . according to the main cultivation specialties, biological properties, and morphological characteristics, nhcc are classified into five varieties, including pak-choi, wutatsai, flowering chinese cabbage, taitsai, and tillering cabbage  <cit> . nhcc is widely used as a vegetable crop because of the strong adaptability, short growth period, good quality, unique flavor, and rich nutrition. thus, it is widely cultivated in southeast asia, japan, usa, and europe, and is gradually becoming an important vegetable worldwide.

the development of molecular markers for the detection and exploitation of dna polymorphisms is a significant application in the field of molecular genetics. the detection and analysis of genetic variation can help us to understand the molecular basis of various biological phenomena  <cit> . since the advent of restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers, a range of other markers, such as random amplified polymorphism dna , amplified fragment length polymorphism , sequence tag sites , snps, and ssrs, have been introduced during the 20th century to fulfill various demands of breeders  <cit> .

assigning molecular markers to linkage groups and constructing genetic maps is an important step for analyzing the genome of species. these linkage maps have been used for marker-assisted breeding, map-based cloning strategies, genome organization and comparative genomics of important species, and the dissection of quantitative traits  <cit> . polymerase chain reaction-based markers have been widely used in the construction of genetic linkage maps for b. oleracea  <cit> , b. nigra  <cit> , b. juncea  <cit> , and b. napus  <cit> . a number of genetic linkage maps based on a range of markers, including rflp, rapd, ssr, and aflp, have been constructed for chinese cabbage  <cit> . however, there are few linkage maps for nhcc  <cit> .

ssr and snp markers are distributed throughout the genome, and they gradually became preferred markers for many applications in genetics and genomics  <cit> . they are suitable for the fine mapping of genes and association studies, which aim at identifying alleles potentially affecting important agronomic traits  <cit> . however, without large numbers of ssr and snp markers, such studies have not been available in most crop species. currently, with the development of next-generation sequencing, it is feasible to develop a large number of ssr and snp markers. developing a large set of ssr and snp markers will facilitate the fine mapping of qtls, improve the identification and exploitation of genes affecting important traits, and enable selective breeding through genomic selection  <cit> .

nhcc, with rich diverse germplasms, originated from china. given its important economic value and its close relationship to a. thaliana and chinese cabbage,  <dig> nhcc accessions were re-sequenced. additionally, the representative accession, nhcc <dig>  has been assembled recently. here, we report, for the first time, a survey of whole genome sequences to develop a large number of ssr and ssr markers. these markers enhance the density of the existing genetic nhcc maps, which could also be a useful source for high-throughput qtl mapping and marker-assisted nhcc improvement. furthermore, breeders could introduce beneficial genes, improving genetic diversity, using these markers for marker-assisted selection.

RESULTS
the development of ssrs in nhcc and a comparative analysis with  <dig> species
we analyzed the distribution of perfect microsatellites with ≥  <dig> repeat units, and a minimum total length of 18 bp in ~ <dig>  mb of the nhcc genome. all ssrs identified in this study have been submitted to the nhccdata website . the content of perfect microsatellites in the genomic sequences of nhcc and  <dig> other species were identified. a total of  <dig>  ssrs with repeats were detected in the nhcc genome, which translated to an overall density across the genome of  <dig>  ssrs/mb. surprisingly, nhcc had a higher microsatellite density than sorghum , potato , and maize . however, its microsatellite density was far less than watermelon , moss , and volvox  .table  <dig>

dinucleotides were the most common ssr type in nhcc genomic sequences, representing  <dig> % of all ssrs, followed by mono-  and trinucleotides . octa- and nonanucleotides were the least frequent repeat types, together representing less than 2% of the total ssrs . the distribution of ssr types in nhcc was most similar to those of chinese cabbage and arabidopsis, which had comparable relative and absolute frequencies for each ssr type, and it was at least similar to the distribution in volvox and watermelon, for which trinucleotides were by far the most frequent repeat type. there were many more dinucleotides and trinucleotides than that in moss and volvox, respectively .table  <dig>

we examined the distribution of nhcc microsatellites with regard to the number of repeat units . for all ssr classes, the microsatellite frequency decreased as the number of repeat units increased. however, the rate of this change was more gradual for mononucleotides and dinucleotide than for longer repeat types, with pentanucleotide  to nonanucleotide  showing the most dramatic frequency reduction. moreover, the total length of dinucleotide sequences was much larger than the other repetitive sequences, with a total length of  <dig>  kb. on the one hand, the mean number of repeat units in the dinucleotides  was over twice as high as the number of repeat units in the trinucleotides , and it was four times higher than in penta- to nonanucleotides  . on the other hand, the dinucleotide repeats  occurred more frequently than other dinucleotides in the nhcc. therefore, the dinucleotide repeats had a greater contribution to the genome fraction occupied by ssrs than other dinucleotide .figure  <dig> relative frequency of ssr types, characterized by the number of repeats in the non-heading chinese cabbage. the graph was based on a total of  <dig>  ssrs detected in a 331-mb, non-redundant genomic dna sequence of the nhcc genome.



of the  <dig>  identified ssr markers,  <dig> were not anchored on chromosomes. in addition, the number of ssr markers was different on each chromosome. the density of ssrs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  across the chromosomes. the most ssr markers  occurred on chromosome  <dig>  while the least were on chromosome  <dig>  . a total of  <dig>  types of repeat motifs were detected in nhcc genomic ssr. the most type was the a/t , followed by ag/ct , at/ta , and aag/ctt , which was similar to other cruciferous species. the remaining types had repeat ratios of less than 4%, and the cg/gc repeat motif was not found among the nhcc genomic ssrs .

the characteristics of ssr markers in nhcc genes and a functional analysis
a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified in nhcc genes, accounting for  <dig> % of the total genomic ssrs. trinucleotides were the most common ssr type, representing  <dig> %  of all genic ssrs. even though dinucleotides are the most common type in the genome, trinucleotides may be more common in the gene regions because they do not cause gene translational changes. they are followed by dinucleotide  and mononucleotides  . in total,  <dig> repeat motifs were identified in nhcc genes, and the most type was ag/ct , followed by a/t , aag/ctt , and at/ta . the other repeat motifs occurred at rates of less than  <dig> %, which was similar to their rates in the genome .

these ssr markers were located in  <dig>  genes, accounting for  <dig> % of the total number of genes, and  <dig> genes contained several ssr markers. the functions of  <dig>  genes containing ssrs were divided into three classes, cellular location, molecular function, and biological process. they were further subdivided into  <dig> functional subsets. the greatest number of genes was associated with the binding factors , followed by the genes involved in metabolic processes, catalytic activities, and cellular processes. this was similar to the classification of the  <dig>  genes containing non-synonymous snps .

ssrs located near important functional genes, such as flower genes and glucosinolate genes, were also identified. most plants undergo a major physiological change from vegetative to reproductive development before flowering. the formation of flowers is a prerequisite for successful sexual reproduction, and fruits of angiosperm flowers are a staple of human and livestock diets  <cit> . glucosinolates are a category of amino acid-derived secondary metabolites found in the cruciferae family. glucosinolates and their degradation products play important roles in pathogen and insect interactions, especially in human health  <cit> . based on their importance, we identified these genes and their related ssr markers in nhcc. in our analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed high homology  to the chinese cabbage flower genes and glucosinolate genes, respectively. finally,  <dig> and  <dig> ssrs were found in the vicinity of   <dig> flower genes and  <dig> glucosinolate genes, respectively. interestingly, the number of these genes and related ssrs on chromosome  <dig> was more than on each of the other nine chromosomes. these markers will be useful for marker-assisted selection breeding in the future .figure  <dig> chromosomal locations of non-heading chinese cabbage flower  and glucosinolate  genes with related ssr markers . in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssrs were depicted on the  <dig> nhcc chromosomes. scale is in megabases .



the abundance and length frequency analyses of ssr repeat motifs
we conducted a detailed analysis of individual repeat motifs for each type of ssr found in the genomic sequences of nhcc and the other  <dig> species. the results showed that a/t , ag/ct , aag/ctt , aaat/attt , aaaat/atttt , aaaaat/attttt , aaaccct/agggttt , aaaaaaat/attttttt , and aaaataaat/atttatttt  were the most frequent motifs from mono- to nonanucleotides in the nhcc genome. a/t repeats were not only the predominant mononucleotide, but they were also the most frequent motif in the entire genome, accounting for  <dig> % of the total ssrs, followed by ag/ct  and at/at  repeats. these three repeat types were more than half of the total ssrs in nhcc genomic sequences . in addition, the motif density was also calculated in the other  <dig> species for a comparative analysis. the results showed that the density of a/t repeats was higher than c/g repeats in most examined species . for dinucleotides, all species had a relative low density  of cg/cg repeats. the number of at/at repeats was higher than other dinucleotides in  <dig> species. however, ag/ct repeats  were slightly more abundant than at/at repeats  in nhcc. surprisingly, the density of ac/gt repeats  was far greater than of other dinucleotides in volvox. the density of aag/ctt repeats was greater than other trinucleotide in cruciferous , which was different from the other examined species. most species had a higher density of aat/att repeats than other trinucleotide repeats. however, the density of ccg/cgg repeats was higher than other trinucleotides in rice and volvox. in nhcc, as well as in most of other species examined, the frequencies of different tetranucleotides revealed that repeats of aaat/attt were most common, whereas acat/atgt  and agat/atct  repeats predominated in volvox and rice, respectively. conversely, the gc-rich motifs were of relatively lower densities in most species analyzed, such as cccg/cggg and ccgg/ccgg. however, the opposite distribution was observed in volvox .

the polymorphism analysis of ssr markers among  <dig> cruciferae accessions
a total of  <dig>   ssr primer pairs were designed from the  <dig>  ssrs in the gene sequences. of these,  <dig> primer pairs were selected for validation by ssr loci amplification, and  <dig> produced a reproducible and clear amplicon of the expected size. the product sizes ranged from  <dig> to 280 bp. a total of  <dig>  were polymorphic among the  <dig> analyzed species of cruciferae, including one arabidopsis, two broccoli, one chinese cabbage, and  <dig> nhcc accessions .

a total of  <dig> polymorphic bands were produced by  <dig> primer pairs in the  <dig> accessions. the number of polymorphic bands ranged from two to five, with an average of  <dig>  for each primer. the major allele frequency at each locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the polymorphism information content  at each locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> /loci. the expected heterozygosity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the observed heterozygosity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . although a limited number of ssr primers were used in this experiment, they produced rich polymorphic bands in the  <dig> cruciferae accessions. the gene flow estimated from f-statistics was from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a total of  <dig> ssr primers showed significant deviations from the hardy–weinberg equilibrium . nei’s genetic identity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the genetic distance ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . shannon’s information index ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  . these results indicated that a large amount of genetic diversity in the  <dig> cruciferae had been assessed. the dendrogram showed that they fell into four distinct clusters. cluster  <dig> was comprised of  <dig> nhcc accessions, including five varieties of nhcc. chinese cabbage belonged to cluster  <dig>  which had a close relationship with the taitsai variety of nhcc. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> contained broccoli and arabidopsis, respectively. the principal component analysis  and population structure analysis corroborated this classification .table  <dig>

the identification and characteristic of snps in  <dig> nhcc accessions
a comparison of  <dig> nhcc accessions of five varieties with the chinese cabbage genome was used to develop snps. to increase accuracy and minimize false-positive snps, we eliminated snp sites that had missing data in any one of the  <dig> nhcc accessions. finally,  <dig> , <dig> snp loci were identified, and the average snp density in the whole genome was  <dig> /kb. this was greater than in tomato  and rice , but lower than in citrus  and potato   <cit> . all snps identified in this study have been submitted to the nhccdata website .

the number of snps for each accession ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average heterozygous ratio of the snps was ~ <dig> %, and the heterozygous ratio ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % among  <dig> nhcc accessions. an average of  <dig>  snps was identified in coding domain sequences. the number of non-synonymous snps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  . of the identified snps, excluding those that were heterozygous, an average ~ <dig> % of snps belonged to the transition type in the  <dig> nhcc. the transition/transversion ratio can be used to measure the genetic distances. generally, the higher transition/transversion ratio, the lower genetic divergence between two species. the high ratio of  <dig>  between the nhcc and chinese cabbage revealed the relatively low level of polymorphisms between them. a relatively high frequency of c/t alleles was identified, which was also observed in citrus, eggplant, and bean   <cit> .table  <dig>

the excavation of unique snps and genes from five nhcc varieties
the five varieties of nhcc have their own morphological characteristics. the variety-related snps and genes were quickly and accurately identified using the varieties genomic information. based on the genotypes and phenotypes of the five varieties, the genes associated with variety-related traits were uncovered. for example, by comparing the tillering cabbage and other four varieties, genes associated with tillering were identified. similarly, the flowering and early bolting genes were identified by comparing the flowering chinese cabbage variety and other varieties. additionally, we have detected the expression of variety-specific genes at the transcriptome level. the functional annotation and the metabolic networks were also conducted for differentially expressed genes .

at the genomic level, we identified variety-specific snps. the non-synonymous snps could directly change the encoded amino acid, which could change the function of the protein. therefore, we surveyed the non-synonymous snps in each accession. to better analyze the point mutations, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the five varieties, we exploited the variety-specific non-synonymous snps. these snps were located in  <dig> to  <dig>  genes of the five varieties. transcriptome data were used to identify  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> genes in nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  and nhcc <dig>  respectively . then, the variety-specific degs were identified, whose expression levels were  <dig>  or  <dig> times expression level than each of other varieties. a total of  <dig> variety-specific degs were discovered, consisting of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> low expressing genes and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> high expressing genes in the five varieties, respectively.

to obtain a more intuitive understanding of the relationship among these degs, clustering analyses were carried out based on the expression level. the high expressing degs could be divided into five groups, corresponding to the five varieties , while low expressing degs did not completely cluster based on variety . furthermore, the relationships among these genes was studied using cytoscape software. finally, the absolute pearson’s correlation coefficients of the  <dig>  gene pairs were greater than  <dig>  in the high expressing degs. most genes had positive relationships, except the cabbageg_a_f_g <dig>  cabbageg_a_f_g <dig>  and cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> genes. these genes could be divided into four groups, corresponding to the four varieties. only one gene was identified in nhcc <dig>  so it was not involved in the network . the relationships among low expressing genes were complex, with  <dig> negative- and  <dig> positive-related gene pairs . in addition,  <dig> negative- and  <dig>  positive-related gene pairs existed in the high and low expressing genes, respectively .figure  <dig> expression profile of variety-specific, high-level, differentially expressed non-heading chinese cabbage genes. the expression levels of all genes identified in this study were measured by transcriptome data from the five nhcc varieties. hierarchical clustering was used to represent the gene expression for each variety.



using strict standards, which defined the expression level of the gene as  <dig>  or  <dig> times the lowest or highest expression, respectively, of the other varieties,  <dig> variety-specific degs were identified. of which,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were found in nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  nhcc <dig>  and nhcc <dig>  respectively, while none was identified in nhcc <dig>  the analysis of pearson’s correlation coefficients showed that  <dig> negative- and  <dig> positive-related gene pairs were present in these genes, and the cabbageg_a_f_g <dig> gene existed in more negative gene pairs than any other genes .

for a more intuitive presentation of these non-synonymous snps, we plotted their distribution on the chromosomes , revealing that their distributions were different in each accession. this may be because of differential selection during the breeding process. in general, regions with more non-synonymous mutations were often the subject of selection. in  <dig> nhcc accessions,  <dig>  regions with a total length of  <dig> kb were identified. the number of non-synonymous snps was greater than  <dig> in these regions. the number of these regions was different on each chromosome, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in addition, we mapped the density of non-synonymous snps on the chromosomes for each accession .figure  <dig> the density of non-synonymous snps in  <dig> non-heading chinese cabbage accessions on chromosomes. the number of non-synonymous snps was calculated for each dot using 20-kb windows. the figure shows a fragment of chromosome  <dig> as an example.



the evolutionary relationship of  <dig> nhcc accessions by snp markers
to understand the phylogenetic relationships causing morphological diversity in nhcc, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed by mega <dig> using  <dig> nhcc accessions and chinese cabbage chiifu-401- <dig>  <cit> . the snps located in the coding domain sequences, excluding the missing site, were used to construct the phylogenic tree . in the phylogenetic tree, two accessions of pak-choi, nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>  and flowering chinese cabbage, nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>  clustered together. the taitsai  had a close relationship with chinese cabbage. although nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig> belonged to the tillering cabbage, they did not cluster together. the previous classification might be only based on the tiller, which affected by only a few genes. thus, they did not cluster together in this tree whose construction was based on genome-wide snps. the nhcc <dig> and nhcc <dig>  which share land collapse and short plant height characteristics, clustered together. additionally, nhcc <dig>  which shares similar traits with nhcc <dig>  clustered together. these phenomena indicated that the morphological classification might be based on one or several distinct external plant characteristics. however, classification should be determined by the internal genes, coupled with complex environmental interactions. therefore, the traditional morphological classification might be erroneous. currently, we can correct traditional morphological classifications through whole-genome sequencing and re-sequencing, furthering the understanding of the nhcc.figure  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of  <dig> non-heading chinese cabbage accessions  and chinese cabbage constructed by mega <dig> using snps in the coding domain sequences. the numbers are bootstrap values based on  <dig>  iterations. only bootstrap values larger than  <dig> are indicated.



discussion
efficient and strict flow chart for identification of ssr and snp markers
in this study, our major aims were to find a large set of accurate ssr and snp markers in the nhcc, and to gain further insight into the genetic diversity and relationships among representative cultivars and related species. we analyzed the distribution and frequency of microsatellites with mono- to nonanucleotide motifs. to find more accurate ssrs, we used the strict standard that the total ssr length is not less than 18 bp. thus, the results of this study may differ from previous studies. when compared with previous research, the results obtained could differ because of the following aspects:  different search parameters, including the different minimum length , and different repeat types ;  different software and algorithms used for the ssr search ;  the data used for ssr detection was of a different size and version; and  the different analytical methods and manifestations used . these seemingly minor differences in procedure could strongly influence microsatellite distributions and comparisons among studies. for the development of snp markers, errors in sequencing or assembling of the nhcc genome also might lead to false snps. therefore, it is important to consider the above-mentioned points when we compared the ssr or snp frequency and density generated by different genome datasets or research groups.

genetic relationship analysis of  <dig> cruciferae species
the  <dig> nhcc accessions and four other cruciferae species were analyzed using ssr markers. the analyses of a dendrogram and population structure, as well as pca, revealed four clusters. although the research did not completely distinguish the five nhcc varieties, which may have been because of the limited number of ssr markers used for the genetic analyses, it accurately separated nhcc, chinese cabbage, broccoli, and arabidopsis. thus, a larger number of snp markers were used to construct the phylogenic tree. both of the ssr and snp marker analyses revealed that the taitsai variety  had a close relationship with chinese cabbage. it was also consistent with the theory that chinese cabbage was derived from a hybrid of taitsai and turnip  <cit> . the pak-choi, flowering chinese cabbage, and taitsai varieties could be distinguished using the snp markers. the classification of tillering cabbage and wutatsai might be only based on one or several distinct phenotypic plant characteristics; thus, we attempted to distinguish them using whole genome snps. classification only based on morphology may be problematic, and a true classification should be determined using the internal genes of the whole genome, coupled with the complex environmental factors. currently, it is possible for us to adjust traditional morphological classifications using the ssrs and snps of the whole genome. furthermore, these markers developed in our study can be useful for population structure analyses of nhcc and other related species in the future.

use of new ssr and snp markers for nhcc and cruciferous species research
it was important to develop molecular markers to investigate genetic variability and explore genome evolutionary. until now, only a few low-density genetic maps have been constructed owing to lack of highly polymorphic and reliable molecular markers in nhcc. in addition, most linkage maps with important agronomic trait loci have been developed with primarily low-throughput markers, such as aflp, rflp, and rapd or a few ssr markers. the development of these markers is time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. thus, only a few economically important genes had been identified using a map-based cloning strategy in nhcc  <cit> , suggesting that marker-assisted selection breeding was still not well developed compared with in other horticultural species, such as cucumber  <cit> . ssr or snp markers have proven to be useful markers in the population genetic studies of species  <cit> . currently, with the development of bioinformatics and the next-generation sequencing technology, it is very convenient and feasible to obtain a large number of ssr and snp markers by genome sequencing. in this study, we developed a large number of ssr and snp markers, and obtained their exact physical positions in the nhcc genome. we designed primer pairs for nhcc ssrs, and verified the polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction  and gel electrophoresis in some important cruciferous species. nhcc had a relatively large level of morphological and genetic polymorphisms, and snps were identified in different varieties. in our study, the snps were classified according to the five varieties. variety-specific genes were also identified and verified using the transcriptome. these genes might be useful for distinguishing the five varieties of nhcc.

CONCLUSIONS
nhcc is an ecologically important vegetable crop in southeast asia, japan, usa, and europe. however, the insufficient genomic and transcriptome data in public databases have limited our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of nhcc. with the development of high-throughput genome sequencing technology, it is now possible to uncover large numbers of dna markers. this work contributed to a detailed characterization of  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig> , <dig> snps in nhcc and compared them with markers in other representative species. for the ssr markers, dinucleotide repeats were the most frequent ssrs in the genome. while the frequency of trinucleotide repeats were much higher than dinucleotides in gene sequences. primers for the ssrs in the gene sequences of nhcc were designed, and the ssr polymorphisms were verified using pcr. the results showed that the ssr markers were highly polymorphic among the  <dig> cruciferous species. by comparing nhcc with chinese cabbage, a large number of snp markers were identified in the five nhcc varieties. the potential variety-specific related genes identified lay a solid foundation for further investigations into comparative genome analyses among the five varieties. furthermore, they will be useful for further functional genomic studies in the brassica genus. these snp and ssr markers will be valuable genomic resources for future cruciferous research and breeding applications.
