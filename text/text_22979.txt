BACKGROUND
the synthesis of functional transcripts in eukaryotes always involves non-coding rnas  within ribonucleoprotein complexes  that direct the processing of larger precursor transcripts. two major families of such molecules include snrnas and snornas, which direct the splicing and guide the chemical modification of rnas, respectively  <cit> . in addition, the advent of complete genome sequencing coupled with high-throughput expression profiling technologies led to the discovery of thousands of novel ncrnas in eukaryotes that regulate gene expression at nearly all levels. among them, the most studied in the last decade have been the microrna  and small interfering rna  families, which direct gene silencing and chromatin condensation  <cit> . more recently, many longer ncrnas  with diverse sizes and structures have also been discovered and shown to play central roles in many biological processes  <cit> , including regulation of the alternative splicing that controls flowering and other developmental processes in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in the past decade, a major goal in plant biology research has been to identify novel ncrnas that regulate cell growth, development or adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses. deep sequencing of size-fractionated rnas has become a major source of ncrna discovery, producing myriad ncrna candidates  <cit> . the challenge remained, however, to distinguish functional ncrnas from those produced by the transcriptional noise of the genome or from rna degradation products. in silico approaches represent another important strategy for the identification of novel ncrnas in a variety of sequenced genomes. most of these techniques use algorithms that consider structural rna features that are conserved in known rna families. here, we propose a distinct approach that employs conserved promoter elements of plant snorna genes for the identification of novel ncrnas in the arabidopsis genome.

the snornas represent an abundant family of ncrnas found in the nucleoli of all eukaryotes. most snornas belong to one of two subclasses, c/d box snornas and h/aca box snornas, which guide 2’-o-ribose methylation and the pseudouridylation of specific rna targets, respectively  <cit> . the c/d box and h/aca box snornas form two distinct conserved ribonucleoprotein  particles, characterized by fibrillarin  and dyskerin , respectively  <cit> . the c/d snornas contain the conserved boxes c  near the 5' end and d  near the 3’ end. antisense elements complementary to the rna target sequence are adjacent to the d box or an internal box, d’. the h/aca snornas generally form two hairpins connected by a hinge region, characterized by a conserved box, h , and an aca trinucleotide motif located three residues upstream of the 3’ end. one or both of the hairpins contains an internal loop sequence that is complementary to flanking regions of their target uridine residue, which is modified to become pseudouridine.

functionally similar to snornas are scarnas, which direct rna modifications of snrnas in cajal bodies. scarnas are larger than the predominant classes of snornas and possess the characteristic boxes of both c/d and h/aca snornas as well as cab boxes , which function as cajal body localization signals. similar to snornas, scarnas form conserved scarnps with fibrillarin and dyskerin  <cit> .

snornas have distinct targets and functions. most are responsible for the modification of ribosomal rnas , but others direct changes in other classes of rnas, including trnas and snrnas  <cit> . in addition, some essential snornas such as the conserved u <dig> and u <dig> direct the specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ribosomal rna precursors   <cit> . moreover, many so-called ‘orphan’ snornas have been described for which no target has been predicted, suggesting that they may have additional, currently unknown functions  <cit> . these snornas have been found in humans and mice; compelling evidence has been gathered for a c/d snorna family that is expressed exclusively in the brain, where the snornas target and control the alternative splicing of a serotonin receptor mrna precursor  <cit> .

in addition to the canonical structured snornas, many others have been discovered that, while maintaining the canonical c/d or h/aca core structure, have additional extensions and fulfill extra functions. one example is the telomerase rna , a subunit of the rnp telomerase complex, which can guide the synthesis of telomeres in mammals. tr is a 400- to 500-nucleotide rna characterized by a 3’ h/aca snorna structure  <cit> .

furthermore, some snornas have dual functions, as they are processed into small ncrnas with mirna-like functions in animals . in plants, small rnas derived from snornas have been associated with ago protein in both arabidopsis and rice, but their role has not been elucidated  <cit> . additionally, some mirna precursors have snorna features and can even function as snornas  <cit> .

in arabidopsis and rice, more than  <dig> canonical snornas and scarnas have been identified so far . most plant snornas are encoded by polycistronic genes for snorna precursors , which encode two or more snornas. these pre-snornas are released by endonucleolytic cleavage of the poly-snorna, and subsequent exonucleolytic trimming produces mature 5’ and 3’ snorna ends. in arabidopsis, most polycistronic snorna genes are independent units that are transcribed by rna pol ii from a single promoter. however, some plant snornas are also encoded within an intron of a protein-coding gene. these intronic snornas, which can be either monocistronic or polycistronic, are released from the introns produced by pre-mrna splicing. notably, most of the host genes that encode intronic snorna in plants encode ribosomal protein genes  or proteins related to ribosome biogenesis  <cit> .

notably, in arabidopsis, nearly all rp genes and other genes encoding proteins related to ribosome biogenesis and translation, together with polycistronic snornas, share two conserved promoter elements: the telo-box , which has a sequence related to telomere repeats, and the site ii element   <cit> . these two elements, hereafter called telosii, can be found in any orientation and order upstream of the promoter region containing the tata box. similarly, telosii elements characterize the promoters that control polycistronic snornas and rp genes in rice  <cit> . an analogous situation occurs in yeast, in which the rp gene and snorna promoters share a characteristic telomere-related motif, arccctaa, which is required for their transcription and is recognized by the telomere-binding protein tbp <dig>  <cit> . gain-of-function experiments in arabidopsis showed that the telo-box acts synergistically with the site ii element to coordinate the expression of these genes throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . additionally, the site ii element has been demonstrated to bind to a transcription factor, tcp <dig>  in arabidopsis  <cit> .

the overall data strongly indicate that telosii promoters coordinate the expression of snornas along with that of protein-coding genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis and in translational control during the cell cycle. the polycistronic organization of snornas would further contribute to the coordinated expression of these molecules in plants.

high-throughput sequencing approaches dedicated to the identification of novel functional ncrnas produce an enormous amount of putative predictions; in plants, most predictions correspond to repeat-derived sirnas originating from spurious transcription or rna degradation. likewise, in silico approaches designed to detect novel ncrnas are mainly based on algorithms considering the structural features of known rna families. here, to reduce the noise-related 'rna background' and to enhance the detection of new rna families, we propose an approach based on using the telosii promoter motifs of the plant snorna genes to search for novel ncrnas. application of this strategy to the arabidopsis genome resulted in the discovery of  <dig> novel snorna-like species,  <dig> novel ncrnas without any relation to already described rnas, and two dicistronic snorna-mirna genes. we further show that this arrangement can also be found in rice, suggesting a tight evolutionary relationship between snornas and micrornas in plants.

RESULTS
computational approach to the identification of novel ncrnas containing telo-box and site ii regulatory elements
to systematically identify novel non-coding rna  genes directed by telosii cis-regulatory elements in arabidopsis, we assembled a customized pipeline . we considered a region as a candidate promoter if both the telo-box and site ii elements  were found  in a sequence window of  <dig> kb as suggested earlier by gaspin et al.  <cit> . the next step in prediction involved testing adjacent regions. based on the features of known snornas obtained from previous studies , we scanned  <dig> nt downstream of telosii for existing gene annotations. for that purpose, we used annotations contained in the arabidopsis tair <dig> database  <cit>  and information contained in both the microrna database   <cit>  and the plant long ncrna database   <cit> . finally, all predicted ncrna candidates passing the above criteria were analyzed using rfam, which reported the full collection of validated ncrnas and their classification into distinct rna families  <cit> .fig.  <dig> computational analysis pipeline for the identification of ncrna genes containing telosii elements in arabidopsis



the first screening identified  <dig> non-redundant telosii loci in arabidopsis intergenic regions, of which  <dig> loci were placed upstream of the transcription start sites  of annotated protein coding genes . these included all of the rp gene promoter regions previously described by gaspin et al.  <cit> . these mrna encoding loci were not examined in subsequent steps. in addition,  <dig> loci contained signatures of transposable elements . although there is strong evidence that functional ncrnas, including several snornas and mirnas, are related to tes in eukaryotes , we decided not to consider them for further analysis to maintain stringent conditions to identify the most promising candidates.

among the remaining loci,  <dig> mapped to known ncrna genes. these correspond to  <dig> loci encoding  <dig> known snornas characterized in previous studies  and  <dig> genes encoding mirnas annotated in mirbase  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> telosii loci mapped to genes expressing long intergenic ncrnas  that were previously identified  <cit>  and recorded in plncdb  <cit> . these results confirmed that our approach of using telosii as an indicator could effectively detect functional ncrnas and allowed the identification of  <dig> potential novel ncrna candidates.

in the next step, we estimated the protein-coding potential of the 287ncrna candidates. to this end, we adopted estscan  <cit> , a program used to detect protein coding regions in ests. this step revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate loci had protein coding capability. to maintain stringent parameters for the selection of ncrnas candidates, we excluded these sequences from further analyses.

characterization of novel snornas
the remaining  <dig> ncrna candidates were analyzed using snoreport, an algorithm that predicts both c/d and h/aca box snorna/scarnas  <cit> , and were subsequently processed with rfam tools  <cit>  to detect any rna family signature in the remaining predictions. this process identified  <dig> telosii loci associated with snorna-like gene candidates . a detailed survey of these genomic regions using snoreport showed that most of these predictions corresponded to polycistronic genes encoding two or more snornas, thereby corresponding well to the organization of plant snorna genes  <cit> .

we further restricted our selection to those loci whose expression was supported by cdna, est, or rna-seq data available in the tair database. this restriction resulted in the designation of  <dig> polycistronic/monocistronic telosii gene loci for further detailed analyses . the  <dig> telosii loci mapped onto ten polycistronic and two monocistronic snorna genes. overall, these loci encode  <dig> novel snornas, including three h/aca box and  <dig> c/d box snornas . we noted that six of them  had already been described as lincrnas or intermediate-sized rnas and shown to be expressed, albeit without functional assignment  <cit> .table  <dig> list of snorna/scarna candidates

aid with triangle was also identified as long ncrna by liu et al.  <cit> . id with asterisk was also identified as intermediate ncrna by wang et al.  <cit> . id marked in bold was verified by rt-pcr in this study


btermini were predicted by snoreport program, and fine-turned based on small rna enrichments and rt-pcr validation


cnumbers within parentheses denote copies also containing telosii elements


dconservation analysis were performed in arabidopsis lyrata , capsella rubella , brassica rapa , medicago truncatula  and oryza sativa 




as in the case of most previously annotated arabidopsis snornas  <cit> , multiple copies of ten of the predicted novel snornas can be found in the arabidopsis genome by using blastn . however, not all of the snorna copies are associated with telosii elements. for example, there are  <dig> copies of cluster  <dig> in the genome, but only one copy has telosii elements .

comparative analysis with blastn and phytozome database   <cit>  revealed that many of the predicted snorna sequences showed a high level of conservation among the closely related species arabidopsis lyrata, capsella rubella and brassica rapa . no similar sequences were identified in the genomes of more distant dicotyledonous  or monocotyledonous  plant genomes. however, the absence of conservation in the distant species must be taken with caution. the plant snornas exhibit varying degrees of divergence among species according to their targets. some are well conserved among distant species like arabidopsis and rice, while others are restricted to closely related ones. however, snornas with different sequences can still be functional orthologs, targeting the same rrna residue for modification in the two distant species  <cit> . alternatively, the sequence conservation between closely related species and lack of homologs in distant ones may indicate the recent origin of the identified novel snorna genes.

targets for c/d and h/aca snornas were predicted using the plexy  <cit>  and rnasnoop  <cit>  programs, respectively. seven snornas were shown to target the methylation of 18s or 25s rrna-specific residues . in addition,  <dig> other predicted c/d box snornas were found to target the spliceosomal snrnas u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig>  therefore, these should be considered as scarnas, as the modification of these snrnas mainly occurs in cajal bodies  <cit> . we estimated the minimal size of the predicted canonical snorna and scarna transcripts as the distance between the c and d boxes for the c/d snornas and between the stem structure and the 3’ terminal acannn element for the h/aca snornas . figure  <dig> shows ncr <dig> and ncr <dig>  two examples of canonical scarnas that are encoded by a dicistronic gene labeled as cluster  <dig>  the expression of cluster  <dig> was evaluated in seedlings and shown to be specific for the predicted gene by rt-pcr . we have also predicted targets for the ncr <dig> and ncr <dig> to be u6- <dig> and u <dig>  rnas, respectively .fig.  <dig> identification of the clustered scarnas ncr <dig> and ncr <dig>   schematic representation of scarna cluster  <dig>  the scarnas are denoted by gray pentagons. the telosii and the tata elements are represented by boxes: telo , site ii , and tata . the primers designed for cluster  <dig> and the expected amplicon sizes are indicated by arrows and a solid line. additional primers corresponding to the adjacent genes designed for evaluation of independency of transcription of cluster  <dig> are shown as dashed lines.  the sequence features of ncr <dig> and ncr21: motifs c/d and the target antisense region are indicated in red and green colors, respectively; double-stranded-forming regions at the termini are underlined.  predicted targets of ncr <dig> and ncr <dig>  the positions of predicted methylated residues are indicated bold letters and red color.  rt-pcr analysis of cluster  <dig> precursor expression in 2-week-old seedlings. rt+ and rt- indicate the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase in the reaction, respectively. molecular markers are shown in lane labeled with m. genomic dna  was used as positive control. the expected rt-pcr product sizes are provided below the lanes with product amplified on genomic dna. the absence of amplification signals in “upstream” and “downstream” panels indicates the independent from neighboring genes character of cluster  <dig> transcription



for the remaining three predicted c/d box and three predicted h/aca box snornas we could not find the target; therefore, following the widely accepted classification they should be rather considered as 'orphan' snornas  <cit> . for these orphan snornas, the transcript could be much longer than the predicted snorna structure, as there have been several previously described cases of non-canonical snornas and scarnas with sequence extensions that have varying and important biological functions .

in most cases, expression of the predicted snornas/scarnas is supported by rna-seq data. however, except for ncr <dig>  which is encoded by cluster  <dig> , none has any associated est or cdna. notably, this is also the case for other predicted snornas that were previously reported as lincrnas but that have been experimentally confirmed to be transcribed  <cit> . the absence of est sequences is likely due to the lack of polya tails on the eukaryotic snornas. in yeast transcription, the termination of snorna genes by rna pol ii utilizes a distinct mechanism that is not associated with polyadenylation  <cit> . in plants, snornas encoded by polycistronic genes are produced by endonucleolytic cleavage of the precursors and subsequent exonucleolytic trimming of the released snornas to generate their mature extremities  <cit> .

cluster  <dig> was previously reported to be expressed as individual snornas, represented by independent lincrnas, rather than as a polycistronic transcript. to confirm our prediction of the clustered expression of these snornas, we amplified the polycistronic precursor by rt-pcr. our result clearly shows the amplification of one precursor encoding predicted snornas . a similar result was observed for cluster  <dig>  showing amplification of the predicted dicistronic precursor.

we also confirmed the expression of the predicted snorna gene loci encoding ncr <dig>  for which no evidence of expression was available in the expression databases, by rt-pcr. the result clearly shows the specific amplification product of an ncr <dig> transcript, confirming its expression in 2-week-old seedlings .

in summary, the evidence presented here reveals  <dig> novel snorna-like candidates that are regulated by telosii elements. seven c/d snornas are predicted to target rrna for methylation,  <dig> represent scarnas and could modify snrnas, and six have characteristics of orphan snornas and probably fulfill additional, unknown functions.

a novel class of polycistronic sno-mirna genes
notably, three telosii loci were mapped to predicted snorna genes that are encoded in the proximity to annotated three distinct mirna loci: mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir158b . because we could not find evidence that the predicted snorna associated with mir158b was expressed , we focused on analyzing the novel dicistronic genes snorna-mir <dig> and snorna-mir <dig> 

arabidopsis mir <dig> and mir <dig> are non-conserved mirnas that were identified by the deep sequencing of small rna libraries fromrdr <dig> mutant plants  <cit> . their expression was shown to be very low but was confirmed by northern blot hybridization using lna oligonucleotide probes. additionally, the biogenesis of both mirnas was shown to be specifically dependent on the dcl <dig> enzyme  <cit> .

the region upstream of the predicted mir <dig> precursor  contains a classical telosii motif associated with a tata box element . screening of the flanking genomic sequences with the snoreport program revealed a sequence that can fold into a typical h/aca box snorna structure, including two stems separated by the conserved ananaa motif, a 3’ terminal acannn motif, and an internal loop sequence that could direct the pseudouridylation of the 25s rrna u <dig> residue . we confirmed the expression of the mature 150-nt h/aca snorna by northern blotting in seedlings, leaves and flowers . based on the close proximity of this snorna to mir <dig>  we named it snor <dig> fig.  <dig> schematic representation and experimental validation of the sno-mir <dig> gene.  gene organization of sno-mir <dig>  snor <dig> and mir <dig> are denoted by a gray pentagon and an open pentagon, respectively. the telosii elements and tata box are represented by different boxes: telo-box , site ii , and tata box . both snor <dig> and pre-mir <dig> are covered by cdna bx <dig>  the transcription start site  and transcription termination site  were determined by 5’ race and 3’ race, respectively.  the centroid secondary structure of snor <dig>  drawn by using the rnafold program. the h and aca boxes are denoted by green color. the complementary region to the predicted target 25s rrna is represented by blue color, and details are shown in the blue dashed box. Ψ: pseudouridylation site.  secondary structure of the sno-mir <dig> precursor sequence. mature mir <dig> and the predicted snorna are in purple and green colors, respectively.  northern blot analysis of sno-mir <dig>  the hybridization was carried out in  <dig> different tissues: 2-wk-old seedlings, 3-wk-old leaves and 5-wk-old flowers. lanes in the blots represent the following samples: dcl1- <dig>  dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  rdr <dig>  and rdr6as well as wild-type col <dig>  u <dig> was used as the loading control



several lines of evidence indicate that mir <dig> and snor <dig> are co-transcribed and produced from the same precursor. the first line of evidence is the presence of a  <dig> nt cdna  that encompasses both snor <dig> and pre-mir <dig> . the single-transcript organization was confirmed by rt-pcr using a pair of primers encompassing snor <dig> and mir <dig> . finally, we mapped the transcription start site  and transcription termination site  using 5’ race and 3’ race, respectively . a single major signal clearly mapped the tss upstream of snor <dig>  whereas the tts was mapped downstream of pre-mir <dig> . in conclusion, the snor <dig> and mir <dig> precursors are encoded by a single gene that is transcribed as a 655-nt dicistronic transcript . we named this gene sno-mir <dig>  more details about the small rna sequencing data corresponding to sno-mir <dig> are shown in additional file 5: figure s3a.

the identification of this transcript raised a question regarding how snor <dig> and mir <dig> are produced from the same precursor, considering that each rna uses a different biogenesis pathway. the processing of pre-mirna depends on the endonuclease dcl <dig>  whereas the processing of polycistronic pre-snornas is initiated by the rnase iii homolog of the yeast rnt <dig> enzyme  <cit> . we tested the effect of different mutations in the genes that control mirna and sirna biogenesis on the expression of snor <dig> and mir <dig>  the result clearly shows that the expression of snor <dig> is not affected in any of these mutants, whereas the expression of mir <dig> specifically depends on dcl <dig> , as previously reported  <cit> . this result indicates that the biogenesis of snor <dig> produced from the sno-mir <dig> dicistronic precursor is independent from the mir <dig> biogenesis pathway.

the presence of four mir <dig> signals ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt  is puzzling but does not represent a unique case in plants. in addition to the canonical  <dig> nucleotides mirnas produced by dcl <dig>  this enzyme has been reported to produce longer mirnas up to  <dig> nucleotides. most notably in the case of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which make for both  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides mirnas, it was clearly shown that the production of  <dig> nucleotides mirnas depends on the nature of the foldback structure of the pri-mirna. significantly, these  <dig> nucleotides mirnas were shown to have important roles in driving rdr6-dependent sirna biogenesis  <cit> . one possibility is therefore that the presence of a snorna within the pri-mir <dig> alters somehow the canonical precursor structure processed by dcl <dig> and induces production of the additional  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides mir <dig> fragments. alternatively, one can also imagine that processing of the snornas, which implies previous assembly of a rnp complex on the snorna precursor  <cit>  could interfere with dcl <dig> accuracy in the maturation of the mir <dig>  another possibility that could explain the presence of the longer mir <dig> species may involve modification of the mature mirna molecule by addition of extra residues   <cit> .

a similar genomic organization was observed for the sno-mir <dig> gene . the telosii elements are located upstream of a dicistronic snorna gene cluster encoding c/d box snor <dig> and snor <dig>  these two snornas were previously identified and shown by northern blot to accumulate in vivo  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation and experimental validation of the sno-mir <dig> gene.  gene organization of sno-mir <dig>  the snornas and mir <dig> are denoted by gray pentagon and open pentagon, respectively. the telosii elements and tata box are represented by different boxes: telo-box , site ii , and tata box . the transcription start site  was determined by 5’ race.  5’ race amplification of snor <dig>  a single major signal in 5’ race pcr indicates the transcription start site ; the product size, confirmed by sequencing, was  <dig> nt.  northern blot analysis of snor <dig>  the hybridization was carried out in  <dig> different tissues: 2-wk-old seedlings, 3-wk-old leaves and 5-wk-old flowers. the lines in the blots include the following samples: dcl1- <dig>  dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  rdr <dig>  and rdr <dig> mutants and wild type col <dig>  u <dig> was used as the loading control



no cdna sequence representing this locus could be found. therefore, to confirm that the two snornas and the mir <dig> precursor are co-transcribed, we mapped the transcription start site by 5’ race with a primer complementary to 3’ end of pre-mir <dig>  the result showed a major signal mapping upstream of the snor <dig> that encompassed snor <dig>  snor <dig> and the pre-mir <dig> precursor . furthermore, northern blot analysis indicated that the expression of snor <dig> was not affected in mirna and sirna mutant lines . however, in the northern blot analysis, we could not detect the expression of mir <dig>  most likely because of the very low expression level of this mirna, as previously reported  <cit> . like snor <dig>  the expression of snor <dig> is independent of dcl1; however, dcl <dig> is required for the expression of mir <dig>  <cit> . more details about the small rna sequencing data corresponding to sno-mir <dig> were shown in additional file 5: figure s3b.

the identification of these two sno-mirna genes in arabidopsis led us to search for a similar arrangement in the rice genome, where telosii elements have also been shown to be conserved upstream of rp genes and snorna genes  <cit> . we screened the genomic regions flanking the annotated rice mirnas with the snoreport program. this approach identified  <dig> sno-mirna candidates, four of which were predicted to be controlled by telosii elements . additionally, two of the predicted snorna-mirna precursors, corresponding to mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were adjacent to canonical polycistronic snorna genes that had been previously reported  <cit>  .

osa-mir <dig>  which has been reported by several groups, has been found to be associated with the rice protein ago <dig>  and its target transcript  has been experimentally validated  <cit> . the mir <dig> genomic locus is located immediately downstream of a snorna cluster encoding four different snornas that have been shown to be expressed  <cit> . upstream of this locus, we detected the telosii tata motif . the rice inflorescence rna rt-pcr assay, used to amplify the predicted common precursor by using primers surrounding the three snornas and mir <dig>  did not produce a detectable product, suggesting that the snorna and mirna transcripts are processed independently. however, more detailed analysis points towards a more complex picture. as previously shown, the mir <dig> transcript is processed into two splicing isoforms  <cit> . one has a single exon, and the second has an intron encapsulating the snorna-mirna cluster. therefore, the primers designed for the expression study targeted the intron of the second splicing variant . assuming that the regulation and processing of non-coding rna introns are complex, we suppose that the absence of an rt-pcr signal  could be due to the differences in abundance of the two splicing variants in the tested tissues.

mir <dig> has been identified by high-throughput sequencing of small rna fractions and reported to be highly expressed in rice roots  <cit> . the predicted mir <dig> gene structure also overlaps with a previously described polycistronic snorna cluster   <cit> . this locus is preceded by a site ii element and a tata box but has no detectable telo-box motif. the existence of a cdna sequence  encompassing the whole region suggests that the snornas and mir <dig> are co-transcribed and are probably derived from the processing of a common precursor. the presence of single transcript representing the shared precursor was also confirmed by rt-pcr . however, notably, the sequence encoding the precursor of osa-mir <dig>  <cit>  overlaps with the sequence of osa-snor <dig> , an h/aca box snorna that is conserved in plants  <cit> . it has been previously reported by liu et al.  <cit>  that some small rnas in range of 20– <dig> nt and associated with ago proteins could be derived from snorna precursors in rice. our analysis indicates that both snor <dig> and mir <dig> overlap, therefore it seems that osa-mirna is likely to be one such case.

the examples of mir <dig> and mir <dig> most likely reflect the evolutionary relationship between snornas and mirnas . to further investigate the relationship between snornas and mirnas, we screened the flanking regions of each annotated rice mirna recorded in mirbase to search for closely located snorna signatures by snoreport program, independent of the presence of telosii elements. based on the observation of the average size of snorna precursors achieved from previous studies , we set  <dig> nt as the window size of flanking regions. if any putative snorna can be predicted and not overlapped with mature mirna in the flanking regions, it would be considered as a snorna-mirna candidate. this analysis revealed several examples of mirna precursors that encompassed predicted snornas and that were additionally supported by cdna sequences . however, further experimental studies must be conducted to confirm the presence of mature snorna molecules.

identification of novel ncrnas
the  <dig> remaining ncrnas located downstream of telosii elements  did not show similarity to any known rna family reported in the rfam database. among these ncrnas,  <dig> loci were supported by rna-seq or mpss signatures and/or corresponding ests or cdnas, but had no predicted protein-coding capabilities . the presence of corresponding mpss/est/cdna sequences indicates that, in contrast to the identified snornas , these ncrnas are polyadenylated.ncr <dig> is an interesting example; its expression is supported by short reads from rna-seq and rt-pcr experiments . another seven rt-pcr-validated ncrnas are shown in additional file 9: figure s <dig> table  <dig> list of novel “telo + site ii” ncrnas

in summary, we have identified  <dig> non-coding rnas  whose transcription seems to be under the control of telosii regulatory elements.

discussion
we have successfully identified functional ncrnas by whole genome screening for telosii motifs. the rnas identified in this study can be divided into three distinct groups.

snornas and scarnas
the first group includes  <dig> snornas or scarnas encoded by ten polycistronic clusters and two monocistronic genes. seven of these ncrnas represent canonical c/d snornas that target rrna for methylation, adding previously unidentified members to the numerous snorna families that have already been found in arabidopsis. thirteen of the predicted molecules represent canonical scarnas that are predicted to target snrnas. this result considerably increases the number of arabidopsis scarnas because only  <dig> have been reported previously  <cit> . finally, the remaining six predicted molecules represent orphan snornas for which no rna target could be found . notably, in the case of orphan snornas, the transcripts may be much longer than the minimal size predicted by the snoreport program, estimated as the distance between the conserved elements of canonical snornas. for example, in the case of the telomerase rna in mammals, the transcript is up to  <dig> nucleotides in length and has an h/aca snorna structure at the 3’ end  <cit> . as another example, the c/d box scar <dig> gene in arabidopsis directs the transcription of a 370-nucleotide transcript that accumulates in seedlings and further generates mature scar <dig>  which is <dig> nucleotides long  <cit> .

sno-mirna genes
we have identified sno-mirna genes encoding dicistronic precursors that are processed into both mature snorna and mirna in eukaryotes. previous reports have revealed numerous small rna fragments that are derived from h/aca and c/d box snornas. however, fragments derived from snornas have been shown to function as mirnas in only a few cases, including humans and the protozoan parasite giardia lamblia . notably, in arabidopsis and rice, snorna-derived fragments have also been shown to be associated with ago proteins, which are effectors of risc complexes  <cit> . however, the arabidopsis dicistronic snor-mir <dig> and sno-mir <dig> genes identified in this study represent a different case, as both the snornas and the mirna are processed from a common precursor using two distinct pathways that preserve the integrity of both ncrnas . this situation is similar to that of dicistronict snorna genes, which are specific to plants and produce mature trna and snorna molecules  <cit> . in addition, at least two similar dicistronic snorna-mirna genes have been identified in rice: sno-mir <dig> and sno-mir <dig>  however, as previously mentioned in the case of sno-mir <dig>  the mirna is probably a snorna-derived fragment that is produced by processing conserved snor <dig> .

a set of mirna precursors has been shown to display snorna-like features or, in some cases, even to function as snornas  <cit> . however, in all described examples for each precursor, despite their features, only one mature product  could be detected. we screened the annotated arabidopsis mirna loci to search for additional snorna-mirna genes, without requiring the presence of telosii elements. this analysis revealed five additional loci that encoded potential snornas associated with mirnas . a similar analysis in rice revealed additional putative snorna-mirna dicistronic genes . although we do not know whether all these predicted snornas are expressed from these loci, as we have shown for snor <dig>  snor <dig> in arabidopsis and the snorna cluster from the rice mir <dig> genes, these additional data suggest an evolutionary relation of mirnas and snornas  <cit>  most probably by mechanism similar to mirna precursor formation  <cit> , involving duplication of mirna into an existing snorna precursors.

the snornas, which are also present in archaea, have ancient origins that can be traced back to a primary ancestor over 2 ~  <dig> billion years ago. the snorna gene family was subsequently greatly expanded by retrotransposition associated with transposable elements   <cit>  and by massive gene and chromosomal duplications  <cit> . this dramatic increase in the size of the snorna family was associated with diversification and the acquisition of new targets and functions.

mirnas appeared later in evolution and are not present in archaea, but their progression has also been related to te expansion  <cit> . interestingly, it has been proposed that during the process of snorna expansion and diversification, a subgroup progressively lost snorna functionality and gained new, possibly mirna-related, capabilities  <cit> . this hypothesis would explain the association of many predicted snornas with mirna loci in arabidopsis and rice presented in this study.

ncrnas with unknown functions
we have identified  <dig> ncrnas  that are probably under the control of telosii regulatory elements. these elements have been shown to act synergistically to coordinate the expression of protein-coding genes related to ribosome biogenesis throughout the cell cycle in arabidopsis  <cit> . although the function of these ncrnas is not known, we can speculate that they play important cellular functions that must be coordinated throughout the cell cycle and could, as can all of the other proteins and snornas, control ribosomal functions.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that sequences of telo-box and site ii regulatory elements, characteristic for promoters of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and polycistronic snornas, can be successfully used for whole genome screening for novel non-coding rnas. as expected, the large group of new predictions included novel snornas and scarnas. in addition, we have found genes encoding rna precursors that are processed into both mature snorna and mirna. however, the largest collection of novel transcripts contained ncrnas with unknown functions, providing inspiring opportunities for further research.
