BACKGROUND
l-ornithine, a non-essential amino acid and an important constituent of the urea cycle, is the precursor of other amino acids, such as citrulline and arginine. it is effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of liver diseases  <cit> , and has also been applied to wound healing  <cit> . recently, it was demonstrated that l-ornithine supplementation increased serum levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor- <dig> after heavy-resistance exercise in strength-trained athletes  <cit> . many studies have reported that high yields of l-ornithine can be produced from a citrulline- or arginine-requiring mutant of a coryneform bacterium obtained by classical mutagenesis  <cit> . although this mutant can produce a high yield of l-ornithine, its culture is unstable owing to reversion of the auxotrophic phenotype, which causes the production of l-ornithine to drop markedly.

several recent reports have described progress in metabolic engineering of microorganisms for l-ornithine production. lee and cho reported that an engineered escherichia coli produced  <dig>  mg l-ornithine per gram of dry cell weight , and that addition of glutamate to the culture favoured l-ornithine production in the engineered e. coli <cit> . hwang et al. reported that co-overexpression of argcjbd in a triple-gene knockout strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  resulted in a cellular l-ornithine content of  <dig>  mg/g dcw and a concentration of l-ornithine in the culture medium of  <dig>  mg/l  <cit> . proline can be converted into l-ornithine by ornithine cyclodeaminase, which is a key enzyme responsible for enhancing l-ornithine production by c. glutamicum in proline-supplemented media  <cit> . huang and cho reported that over-expression of the ncgl <dig> open reading frame, exhibiting n-acetylglutamate synthase activity, increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum by 39%  <cit> . recently, the same workers deleted the gluconate kinase gene gntk of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  to obtain c. glutamicum sjc <dig>  which produced  <dig>  g/l of l-ornithine  <cit> . the l-ornithine producing strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  named orn <dig> was constructed and shown to produce l-ornithine from arabinose when arabad from e. coli was expressed  <cit> . recently, this group also constructed an engineered c. glutamicum orn <dig>  to effectively produce l-ornithine from xylose  <cit> . in our previous paper  <cit> , we constructed a strain of c. glutamicum in which three genes had been deleted. this strain, named atcc <dig> , produced l-ornithine of  <dig>  g/l in the optimal medium  <cit> .

adaptive evolution strategies have been proven a feasible and efficient technique to achieve improved cellular properties without requiring metabolic or regulatory details of the strain  <cit> . the defining feature of adaptive evolution involves applying a selection pressure that favours the growth of mutants with the traits of interest. growth-coupled adaptive evolution can significantly increase yields  <cit> . when combined with metabolic engineering, adaptive evolution is known as metabolic evolution engineering. the evolved strains can be further optimised by metabolic engineering. metabolic evolution has been successfully employed for the improved production of succinate  <cit> , l-alanine  <cit> , and dihydroxyacetone  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, metabolic evolution engineering has never been reported to boost the production of l-ornithine.

in this study, we first deleted the spee gene of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  to obtain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> , which was then modified using growth-coupled adaptive evolution to improve l-ornithine production. after comparing the transcriptional levels of select genes of the evolved strain with those of the parent strain, additional genetic modifications were introduced to the evolved strain to further improve l-ornithine production. the mechanism of l-ornithine production by the metabolic evolved strain was also investigated by analysing transcriptional levels of genes of interest, as well as nadph concentrations.

RESULTS
construction of the triple gene deletion c. glutamicum for adaptive evolution
in our previous paper  <cit> , proteomic analysis demonstrated that the spermidine synthase encoded by the spee gene was more abundant in c. glutamicum engineered to overproduce l-ornithine than in wild-type c. glutamicum. the upregulation might result in the degradation of l-ornithine. thus, we deleted the spee gene of c. glutamicum  to obtain c. glutamicum Δape. as expected, the deletion of the spee gene enhanced l-ornithine production. the c. glutamicum Δape strain produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of l-ornithine, which is higher than that of c. glutamicum  . thus, c. glutamicum Δape was used as the parent strain for adaptive evolution.

adaptive evolution
to improve l-ornithine production, c. glutamicum Δape was subjected to adaptive evolution driven by growth-based selection. this process comprised two stages . first, glucose and l-ornithine were added into the fermentation medium to overcome their inhibitions for growth and overproduction of metabolite. screening a mutant resistant to substrate and end product is one common strategy for strain improvement by classical mutagenesis. at the later stage, only glucose was added at gradually increasing levels, and no l-ornithine was needed. after  <dig> days of adaptive evolution, one of the clones, referred to as c. glutamicum Δape  <dig>  was chosen for further study. the c. glutamicum Δape  <dig> strain produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of l-ornithine. the yield was about 20% higher than that of the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape . however, the l-ornithine content of the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape  <dig> was similar to that of the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape. this suggests that the increased l-ornithine level of the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape  <dig> is caused by the increased cell density.

characterisation of the evolved strain using qrt-pcr and sequence analysis
in order to understand the mechanism of the increased l-ornithine level in the evolved strain, we analysed the transcriptional levels of genes that encode enzymes involved in l-ornithine biosynthesis in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig>  these genes comprise pgi , pfka , gap , pyk , pyc , glta , gdh , argb  and argj . and then we compared the data with that obtained in the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape. the results are presented in figure 2a. all of these genes in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> are upregulated, with the smallest degree of upregulation seen for the argb gene.

in an attempt to identify mutations that confer the high-yield phenotype, we sequenced the above genes of the evolved strain Δape <dig> and compared the results with sequences of the same genes from c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  analysis of the sequences of the pgi, pfka, gapa, pyk, pyc, glta, gdh, argb, and argj genes in the evolved strain failed to identify any mutations relative to the parent strain.

genetic modification of the evolved strain
the results shown in figure 2a suggest that expression of the argb gene may be the bottleneck for l-ornithine production by the evolved strain. thus, we first over-expressed either of the c. glutamicum or e. coli argb genes in the evolved strain. over-expression of either of the two argb genes indeed enhanced l-ornithine concentration and content, with over-expression of c. glutamicum argb increasing levels of l-ornithine concentration to a greater degree than that achieved by the over-expression of e. coli argb .

the expression of the arg operon for control of the l-ornithine biosynthesis pathway is regulated by the arginine repressor argr. in addition, the dna-binding affinity of argr to the upstream of argb gene was suggested to play an important role in l-ornithine biosynthesis in c. glutamicum <cit> . deletion of the argr gene is another strategy for enhancing the level of expression of the arg operon. thus, we deleted the argr gene of the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape <dig> to generate c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  as expected, c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of l-ornithine . the concentration of l-ornithine was 27% higher than that of c. glutamicum Δape <dig> 

to investigate the mechanism of l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  we analysed the transcriptional levels of the genes that encode enzymes involved in l-ornithine biosynthesis in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> by using qrt-pcr, and compared the data with that obtained in c. glutamicum Δape . deletion of the argr gene promoted the upregulations of the transcript levels of the pgi, pfka, argb, and argj genes. the respective transcriptional levels of the pgi, pfka, argb, and argj genes in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> are about  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold  higher than those in the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape. in contrast, the respective levels of the same transcripts in c. glutamicum Δape <dig> are only about  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold higher  than those in the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape .

three reactions in the l-ornithine biosynthesis pathway involve nadph. these are the reactions catalysed by nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, nadp-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, and nadp-dependent n-acetyl-gamma-glutamyl-phosphate reductase. to analyse the effect of nadph availability on l-ornithine accumulation, we deleted the argr gene of the parent strain c. glutamicum Δape to obtain c. glutamicum Δaper, and then analysed the nadph contents of the two strains. as expected, c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> produced more nadph and l-ornithine than c. glutamicum Δaper . to better understand the effect of nadph, we compared the transcript levels of the genes involved in nadph synthesis in the c. glutamicum strains Δape6937r <dig> and Δaper. the results are presented in figure  <dig>  in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  the genes involved in nadph synthesis  were upregulated by  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively . the ppnk gene was also upregulated by  <dig> -fold . therefore, we examined whether the increased nadph levels are caused by the upregulations of the transcriptional levels of these genes in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  we over-expressed these genes in c. glutamicum Δaper. the results are presented in table  <dig>  over-expression of the zwf, gnd and ppnk genes indeed increased the concentration of nadph in c. glutamicum Δaper. however, only over-expression of the ppnk gene promoted l-ornithine production. it suggests that only the increased nadph level caused by the elevated transcriptional level of the ppnk gene promoted l-ornithine production.

fermentation of the strain generated by metabolic evolution
for a more detailed view on l-ornithine production, c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> was cultured in a 5-l bioreactor , and was found to grow in a diauxic manner. the maximum l-ornithine concentration  and yield  was obtained at  <dig> h, at which time all glucose in the medium had been consumed.

discussion
in this study, we first deleted the spee gene to enhance l-ornithine production . spermidine synthase encoded by spee catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine. although the genes involved in the biosynthesis of putrescine remain unknown, cells of c. glutamicum contain putrescine and polyaminies  <cit> . the deletion of the spee gene blocked putrescine to be converted into spermidine and might alleviate the degradation of l-ornithine. however, the real reason of promoting l-ornithine production by the deletion of the spee gene should be further investigated.

sequence data of the nine genes of c. glutamicum Δape <dig> we characterised at the transcript level failed to uncover any mutations in the evolved strain. it is possible that mutations in other genes may have conferred the observed phenotypes. these might include other genes that encode enzymes responsible for l-ornithine biosynthesis or transcription factors that regulate the expression of the sequenced genes. kutyna et al. also reported that there were no apparent mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae b2-c <dig> they evolved to generate elevated yields of glycerol  <cit> . further work will be required to identify the genetic determinants of these traits.

in c. glutamicum Δape <dig> and Δape6937r <dig>  elevated transcriptional levels of the genes involved in the upstream pathway of glutamate biosynthesis  indicated increased availability of endogenous glutamate compared with the parental strain. pyruvate kinase is a major bottleneck for glutamate production, and over-expression of the pyc gene improved glutamate production in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit> . shirai et al. reported that the fluxes of the reactions catalysed by pgi, pfka, gap, pyk, pyc, glta, and gdh were increased with glutamate production in c. glutamicum <cit> . in our previous paper  <cit> , these enzymes were more abundant in c. glutamicum engineered to overproduce l-ornithine than in wild-type c. glutamicum. it is thought that increasing the availability of endogenous glutamate might increase l-ornithine production. lee and cho reported that the availability of glutamate was a rate-limiting factor in l-ornithine accumulation, and that addition of glutamate in the media increased l-ornithine production in engineered e. coli <cit> . however, the same group reported that the intracellular concentration and supply of glutamate is not a rate-limiting step for l-ornithine production in an l-ornithine-producer c. glutamicum sj <dig> owing to the presence of rate limiting steps in l-ornithine biosynthesis downstream of glutamate synthesis in c. glutamicum sj <dig>  <cit> . they also reported that the increased availability of glutamate might increase l-ornithine accumulation in certain genetic backgrounds   <cit> . the transcriptional levels of the argb and argj genes were much higher than those of the genes that encode enzymes that act upstream of glutamate in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> . this indicates that there is no rate-limiting step in l-ornithine synthesis downstream of the synthesis of glutamate in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  thus, the elevated transcriptional levels of the genes involved in the upstream pathway of glutamate biosynthesis may be one reason of the increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> 

this study demonstrated that nadph availability and l-ornithine production are strongly correlated. production of l-ornithine requires  <dig> mol of nadph per mole of l-ornithine produced by c. glutamicum. increases in the levels of zwf, gnd, and icd transcripts can increase nadph availability in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  however, increased levels of zwf and gnd transcripts can drive the carbon metabolic flux from the embden–meyerhof–parnas pathway to the pentose phosphate  pathway. moreover, given that the pp pathway is coupled with co <dig> production, direct enhancement of the pp pathway may result in release of co <dig>  thereby decreasing the yield of l-ornithine. thus, enhanced carbon flux through the pp pathway, caused by the upregulation of zwf and gnd at the transcriptional level, inhibits l-ornithine production. our results also demonstrated this point. over-expression of the zwf and gnd genes could not increase l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δaper although it could enhance nadph concentration . these suggest that the increased level of l-ornithine production in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> was not caused by the increased levels of zwf and gnd transcripts.

atp-dependent nad kinase encoded by ppnk catalyzes the phosphorylation of nad to nadp. increased transcriptional levels of ppnk increased the size of the nadp pool, thus potentially increasing the abundance of nadph. our results demonstrated that the increased level of ppnk transcript indeed enhanced the abundance of nadph in the evolved strain c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> . lindner et al. reported that over-expression of ppnk improved l-lysine production in c. glutamicum by 12%  <cit> . overexpression of nadk, which encodes nad kinase, increased the nadph/nadp ratio, which in turn enhanced thymidine biosynthesis in e. coli <cit> . our result also demonstrated that over-expression of the ppnk gene enhanced l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δaper. thus, the elevated level of ppnk transcript that increase the availability of nadph may be another reason of increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> 

other strategies have been developed to improve nadph availability. over-expression of e. coli pntab genes, which encode a membrane-bound transhydrogenase enhanced nadph availability, and thus increased l-lysine levels in c. glutamicum <cit> . in this study, over-expression of e. coli pntab genes enhanced nadph availability , and thus increased l-ornithine levels  in c. glutamicumΔaper . simultaneous chromosomal overexpression of transhydrogenase  and nad kinase  genes had a effect on increasing nadph supply and improving anaerobic isobutanol production  <cit> . replacement of the endogenous nad-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase with the nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans also increased both nadph availability and l-lysine production in c. glutamicum <cit> . the inactivation of the gluconate kinase gene  led to a  <dig> % increase in intracellular nadph concentration and a  <dig> % increase in l-ornithine production  <cit> . these strategies may be useful for further improving l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> 

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of metabolic evolution engineering to increase production of l-ornithine by c. glutamicum. the yield of our engineered stain  is unprecedented in any engineered c. glutamicum strain of which we are aware, including that described in our previous paper   <cit>  and that reported by hwang and cho   <cit> . to date, the highest titre of l-ornithine reported in the literature was  <dig> g/l, as reported by lee et al.  <cit> . those researchers achieved this yield by using a 7-l fed-batch fermentation process with a glucose-feeding strategy and an l-arginine auxotrophic mutant of brevibacterium ketoglutamicum atcc  <dig>  the titre of this auxotrophic mutant, which was generated using classical mutagenesis, was only  <dig> g/l in batch culture  <cit> . this suggests that the yield of the new strains described in this study may be enhanced by growth using fed-batch fermentation technology.

CONCLUSIONS
we first deleted the spee gene of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> , then evolved by a growth-based selection process for  <dig> passages to generate c. glutamicum Δape <dig>  and finally deleted the argr gene of the evolved strain to obtain c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig>  the c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> strain produced  <dig>  g/l of l-ornithine in a 5-l bioreactor, a level unprecedented in any engineered strain. it has been demonstrated that the increased l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum Δape6937r <dig> is dependent on the increased availabilities of glutamate caused by the elevated levels of transcripts involved in the upstream pathway of glutamate biosynthesis and the increased availabilities of nadph caused by the elevated level of ppnk transcript. the availability of nadph plays an important role in l-ornithine production in c. glutamicum.
