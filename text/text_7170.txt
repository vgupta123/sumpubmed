BACKGROUND
the common bean  is a rich and inexpensive source of protein, fiber, and other important micronutrients, and a vital component for fighting hunger among millions of the poorest populations from africa and latin america  <cit> . multiple phenotypic, molecular and genomic traits distinguish the diversity of wild and domesticated common beans into two genetically differentiated gene pools known as mesoamerican and andean . mesoamerican and andean dry beans which are commercially important throughout the world, are cultivated in the north, central and south america, some countries of africa and europe  <cit> .

among the many diseases of common bean, anthracnose, caused by colletotrichum lindemuthianum  briosi and cavara, is one of the most widespread and severe  <cit> . yield reduction in susceptible cultivars can reach up to 100%, under conditions of high humidity and moderate temperatures that propitiate the pathogen’s growing. although genetic resistance is the most cost-effective strategy to manage the anthracnose disease, the wide virulence diversity of c. lindemuthianum still remains the greatest challenge to develop common bean cultivars with effective and durable anthracnose resistance. approximately  <dig> different virulent strains of c. lindemuthianum, known as races, have been described from different worldwide common bean production areas  <cit> .

the virulence diversity of c. lindemuthianum falls into two distinct groups that correspond to the andean and mesoamerican gene pools of the common bean  <cit> . mesoamerican races are virulent on both mesoamerican and andean common bean cultivars, however andean races are more specific: they tend to be more virulent on common beans from the andean pool . nonetheless, andean common bean cultivars often provide effective resistance to highly virulent mesoamerican races of anthracnose pathogen  <cit> . genetic diversity exhibited by mesoamerican common bean cultivars are greater than the one demonstrated by the andean cultivars  <cit> . thus, this is one of the reasons why mesoamerican common bean has been used more than andean to investigate resistance sources to anthracnose pathogen.

previous studies have identified  <dig> dominant anthracnose resistance genes, which were either identified on mesoamerican or andean common bean gene pool. the mesoamerican genes include: co- <dig>  co- <dig> , co- <dig> , co- <dig> , co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co-u, and co-v . the andean genes include: co- <dig> , co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co-x, co-w, co-y, and co-z .

the anthracnose resistance genes have been mapped on seven of the  <dig> chromosomes of common bean . several of these genes have been reported on linkage groups pv <dig>  pv <dig> and pv <dig> that contain gene clusters conferring resistance to anthracnose and other diseases  <cit> . for example, linkage group pv <dig> contains a resistance cluster to anthracnose , rust , and angular leaf spot   <cit> .

the search for new sources of andean resistance to c. lindemuthianum is extremely important for common bean breeding programs in tropical and subtropical regions. paloma is a white-seeded highly productive andean bean with desirable agronomic characteristics  <cit> . therefore, this cultivar has been recommended by the instituto nacional de tecnologia agropecuaria , salta, argentina for cultivation and became popular for human consumption in europe, especially in spain and italy  <cit> . experiments conducted in brazil revealed that paloma is resistant to andean and mesoamerican races of c. lindemuthianum.

given the importance to identify new sources of anthracnose resistance in andean common bean, the objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the genetic resistance of andean common bean cultivar paloma to c. lindemuthianum, 2) to map the anthracnose resistance gene of cultivar paloma and 3) to identify molecular markers linked to this resistance gene.

methods
plant materials and phenotypic reaction to colletotrichum lindemuthianum
the cultivar paloma and other andean common bean cultivars were inoculated with andean races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and with mesoamerican races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of c. lindemuthianum. the other andean bean cultivars, with their respective anthracnose resistance genes, included in this study were: michigan dark red kidney  , kaboon , perry marrow  , and  <dig> , widusa , jalo vermelho  , jalo listras pretas  , pitanga , corinthiano , and jalo eep  <dig> . inoculation of c. lindemuthianum races was conducted on  <dig> plants of each cultivar, when the first trifoliate leaf was fully developed . inoculum for each race was obtained from young bean-pod medium and placed in test tubes containing 5 ml of water-agar, which were kept upright at 22 °c for 14 days according to cárdenas et al.  <cit> . after 14 days, a spore suspension was prepared with sterile distilled water containing tween  <dig> and adjusted to a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> spores ml− <dig>  seedlings with fully developed first trifoliate leaves of common bean cultivars parents, f <dig>  and f2: <dig> were inoculated with spores of selected races of c. lindemuthianum as described by cárdenas et al.  <cit> , using an electric air compressor de vilbiss number  <dig>  after inoculation, the plants were maintained at >95% relative humidity at 20 ± 2 °c with controlled luminosity  in a mist chamber for 3 days. after this period, the plants were removed from the mist chamber and transferred to benches with suitable environment at 22 °c with artificial light  for 7 days. anthracnose disease reactions were rated visually using a scale from  <dig> to  <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . plants with scores from  <dig> to  <dig> were considered resistant while those with scores from  <dig> to  <dig> were considered susceptible.

inheritance test
in order to determine the resistance inheritance in cultivar paloma, plants from the f <dig> populations and parental cultivars were grown under greenhouse conditions. inoculations with c. lindemuthianum races were conducted when the first trifoliate leaf was fully developed . races  <dig> and  <dig> were chosen for the inoculations due to the contrasting pathogenic spectrum observed in the parents from the crosses paloma  × pi  <dig>  and paloma  × cornell 49– <dig> . moreover, the races  <dig> and  <dig> showed high virulence index overcoming the resistance, respectively, in eleven and seven differential cultivars.

ninety-nine f <dig> plants derived from the cross paloma  × cornell 49– <dig>  and  <dig> plants from each parent were inoculated with race  <dig>  additionally, another set of 90 f <dig> plants derived from the cross paloma  × pi  <dig>  were tested with race  <dig>  similarly, 73 f2: <dig> families derived from the cross paloma  × pi  <dig>  were inoculated with race  <dig>  the anthracnose phenotype obtained from these f2: <dig> families was used to compare the phenotype of their corresponding f <dig> plants. these populations were produced at the núcleo de pesquisa aplicada à agricultura  of the universidade estadual de maringá , maringá, paraná, brazil.

the anthracnose virulence phenotype of races  <dig> and  <dig> were confirmed by inoculating the set of  <dig> common bean anthracnose differential cultivars with each of these races  <cit> , because they are used to identify c. lindemuthianum races. race  <dig> was virulent on all differential cultivars, except on g  <dig>  further, race  <dig> was virulent on seven of the  <dig> differentials, including g  <dig> the most resistant genotype among the  <dig> differential cultivars  <cit> .

allelism tests
allelism tests were carried out with  <dig> different f <dig> populations with the aim to investigate the independence of the anthracnose resistance gene in paloma from those previously characterized resistance genes in common bean. for that, paloma was crossed with the following cultivars: michigan dark red kidney  , cornell 49– <dig> , ouro negro , to , g  <dig> , pi  <dig> , tu , ab  <dig> , jalo vermelho , jalo listras pretas , pitanga , corinthiano , crioulo  <dig> , amendoim cavalo, perla, and jalo pintado  <dig>  paloma was used as the female parent. f <dig> seeds from the crosses mentioned above were grown in pots and the dominant morphological markers, such as pink or purple flower color and indeterminate growth habit in male parents, were verified to confirm hybridization. variable numbers of f <dig> seeds from each cross, depending on seed availability, were inoculated with the races  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  spore increase, inoculum preparation, inoculations and evaluations of the anthracnose phenotypes were performed in the same manner as described in the first section of methods. to test the hypothesis of independence of the resistance gene in paloma, the races  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were carefully chosen based on r × r reaction produced in the parents. it is important to mention that races  <dig> and  <dig> are the most frequent races in common bean producing areas in brazil, being present in  <dig> and  <dig> out of the  <dig> states monitored, respectively  <cit> .

bulk segregant analysis and snp assay
plant tissue from paloma, pi  <dig> and from 73 f <dig> plants, derived from the cross paloma × pi  <dig>  were collected for total dna extraction with the purelink genomic plant dna purification kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions. dna bulks were used to perform a bulk segregant analysis to identify snp markers potentially linked to the resistance gene in paloma  <cit> . briefly, two contrasting dna bulks were constructed by pooling equal volumes of fluorometrically standardized dna from six f <dig> plants, which were homozygous for the resistant genotype  and homozygous for the susceptible genotype . homozygous resistant and susceptible f <dig> plants were identified based on the phenotypic assessment evaluation conducted on the f2: <dig> families of the same cross inoculated with c. lindemuthianum race  <dig> 

the bulk segregant analysis with snp markers was performed at the soybean genomics and improvement laboratory of the usda-ars at the beltsville agricultural research center, maryland, usa, using the illumina barcbean6k_ <dig> beadchip, containing  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism  dna markers  <cit> . snp genotyping with illumina beadchip was carried out as described by song et al.  <cit>  and performed according to the infinium hd assay ultra protocol . the beadchip was imaged using the illumina beadarray reader to measure fluorescence intensity. for each snp locus, alleles were automatically called with the genomestudio genotyping module v <dig> . <dig>  and later manually checked. a snp was considered positive when polymorphism between paloma  and pi  <dig>  was observed and the sb clustered with pi  <dig>  and the rb clustered with cultivar paloma.

positively associated snp markers derived from barcbean6k_ <dig> beadchip were selected to develop kompetitive allele specific pcr  markers. kasp primer sequences were designed using the software primerexpress. kasp assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, pcr reaction was conducted in a 10 μl final volume containing 5 μl of 2x premade kasp master mix ,  <dig>  μl of primer mix  and 20–40 ng of genomic dna. after pcr amplification, pcr plates were scanned in a mx3000p qpcr reader and allele scores were obtained using the mxpro qpcr software .

statistical analyses
segregation analyses of the disease reaction of 99 f <dig> individuals from the cross paloma  × cornell 49– <dig>  and 90 f <dig> plants from the cross paloma  × pi  <dig> , inoculated respectively with races  <dig> and  <dig>  were performed with the chi-square  test using the genes software  <cit> . these analyses followed the mendelian segregation hypothesis of  <dig> r  to  <dig> rr . the segregation analyses of the f2: <dig> families were performed using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test  for the hypothesis of mendelian segregation 1:2: <dig> . the segregation analysis of the disease reaction of f <dig> populations from each cross  were conducted using the chi-square test of goodness-of-fit to the hypothesis of mendelian segregation 15: <dig>  for two independent genes.

the snp markers were used to map the resistance gene in paloma using dna of the f <dig> plants from paloma × pi  <dig> cross. genetic distances between the snp markers and the new anthracnose resistance gene in paloma was estimated using software joinmap  <dig>   <cit> . default settings of regression mapping algorithm based on the kosambi map function were attributed to define the linkage order and distances in centimorgans . a minimum likelihood of odds  ≥ <dig>  and a maximum distance of ≤50 cm were used to test linkages among markers. genetic linkage map, containing the genetic distances between snp markers and the anthracnose resistance gene in paloma, was drawn using the software mapchart  <cit> . the snp markers flanking the anthracnose resistance locus in paloma were used to determine the physical region of the new locus. candidate annotated genes in the region were identified by inspecting the genome browser from the reference genome of common bean in phytozome.org  <cit> .

nine positive snps, distributed in the candidate physical region, were selected for the development of kasp assays to genotype the 73 f <dig> plants from the cross paloma × pi  <dig> . the phenotypic evaluations carried out in the corresponding f2: <dig> families were combined with the snp genotyping of the f <dig> population. a total of six f <dig> plants revealed breakpoints, suggesting that the andean anthracnose resistance gene in paloma is flanked by markers ss <dig>  and ss <dig> , spanning a  <dig>  bp region of chromosome pv <dig> . the mapping analysis of these snp markers associated with the 73 f <dig> plants of paloma × pi  <dig> cross demonstrated that the resistance locus to c. lindemuthianum of paloma is located between the markers ss <dig> and ss <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively .table  <dig> kasp primers associated with the resistant gene in paloma

in order to obtain more experimental precision, the three snp markers, which are very close linked to co-pa, were carefully chosen for genotyping the 163 f <dig> plants from paloma × pi  <dig> cross, involving the same 73 f <dig> individuals previously genotyped and a new set of 90 f <dig> plants . for that, all these plants had their phenotypic reaction evaluated using the race  <dig> of the c. lindemuthianum. these results revealed that the anthracnose resistance gene co-pa of paloma is located between ss <dig> and ss <dig> markers at the distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively. additionally, the snp marker ss <dig> effectively differentiated homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible and heterozygous individuals .fig.  <dig> a snp marker display. clustering of the 73 f <dig> individuals from paloma × pi  <dig> cross: paloma allele , pi  <dig> allele  and heterozygous allele  for the ss <dig> snp marker

discussion
a broad genetic base is essential for the protection of crops, especially for their protection against pathogens with high virulence diversity. the utilization of andean common bean for the genetic improvement of the common bean crop has lagged far behind the use of mesoamerican common bean  <cit> . paradoxically, the underutilized genetic diversity of andean common bean contains genes conferring effective resistance to highly virulent mesoamerican races of the pathogens that cause anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and rust diseases of common bean  <cit> . incorporating andean anthracnose resistance genes, such as the new gene  in paloma in common bean-breeding programs, would make possible the development of common bean cultivars with broad resistance to c. lindemuthianum.

the results of this study showed that the andean cultivar paloma is a very important source of anthracnose resistance, particularly for the protection against mesoamerican races of this pathogen. we observed that paloma was resistant to c. lindemuthianum andean races  <dig> and  <dig> and to mesoamerican races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, paloma as shown to be effective against mesoamerican races of the anthracnose pathogen that are frequent in countries such as: united states, brazil and central america. the resistance of paloma to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> has a great importance for common bean breeding programs in brazil, especially on places where these races are widespread  <cit> . race  <dig> is present in  <dig> of the  <dig> states of brazil, while race  <dig> is present in  <dig> states of this country  <cit> . race  <dig> has also been reported in honduras, mexico, usa, costa rica, guatemala, puerto rico, india and canada  <cit> . among the resistance genes in andean cultivars, co-1

, co- <dig> and co- <dig> are resistant to andean race  <dig>  this race overcomes the resistance of the andean co- <dig>  co-1
 <dig>  co-1
 <dig>  co-1
 <dig>  co- <dig> and co- <dig> resistant genes. race  <dig> also overcomes the resistance of andean common bean jalo eep <dig>  which contains the co-w, co-x, co-y and co-z anthracnose resistant genes.

paloma is also resistant to the highly virulent mesoamerican races  <dig> and  <dig>  race  <dig> is virulent on  <dig> of the  <dig> differential cultivars. thus, this race overcomes the resistance of the co- <dig> and four of its alleles, co- <dig>  co- <dig>  some of the alleles of co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  and the four anthracnose genes present in jalo eep  <dig>  g  <dig> was the only differential cultivar that was resistant to race  <dig>  among the andean anthracnose resistance genes, only co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co-1
 <dig> were resistant to race  <dig>  similarly, race  <dig> overcomes the resistance of seven of the  <dig> differential cultivars, including g  <dig> that contains the co-3
5
, co-4
 <dig> and co-5
 <dig> alleles. andean alleles co- <dig>  co-1
 <dig>  co-1
 <dig>  co-1
 <dig>  and gene co- <dig> were resistant to race  <dig>  therefore, only and  <dig>  and paloma  were resistant to the highly virulent  <dig> and  <dig> races of c. lindemuthianum.

the inheritance of resistance evaluation from the cross paloma  × cornell 49– <dig>  - inoculated with race  <dig>  and the cross paloma  × pi  <dig>  - inoculated with race  <dig>  revealed the presence of a single dominant gene in paloma. furthermore, bulk segregant analysis, using the barcbean6k_ <dig> beadchip in common bean, positioned the resistance gene in paloma  in the lower arm of chromosome pv <dig> where other anthracnose resistant genes have been mapped. these genes include co- <dig> and its alleles, co- <dig>  co-x and co-w. the allelism tests showed that co-pa is independent from the allelic series co- <dig> and the co- <dig> genes. no allelism test was conducted with jalo eep <dig>  which contains two anthracnose resistant genes  in pv <dig>  however, the anthracnose resistant phenotype of paloma and jalo eep <dig> were different for races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  suggesting that co-pa may be different from co-x and co-w .

the co-pa anthracnose resistant gene in paloma is mapped to a cluster containing anthracnose , rust  and angular leaf spot  disease resistant genes . dense clusters of tightly linked resistance-associated genes in the common bean genome encode mostly nb-lrr  genes  <cit> . the identification of this protein class across diverse plant species demonstrated that nb-lrr genes are a pillar of plant defense  <cit> . nb-lrr gene clusters enriched with an n-terminal coiled-coil domain  or an n-terminal toll-interleukin- <dig> receptor -like domain  were identified at the ends of common bean chromosomes, such as the distal part of pv <dig>  <cit> . it is worth noting that all resistance genes currently mapped on chromosome pv <dig> are from common bean of andean origin. this is a unique situation among the chromosomes of common bean containing disease resistance genes.

the combined results of ss <dig> and ss <dig> snp markers, with the monogenic inheritance and allelism tests, confirmed the hypothesis that a single dominant gene confers resistance to c. lindemuthianum races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the andean common bean cultivar paloma. likewise, this gene is independent from those common bean anthracnose resistance genes previously characterized. the authors propose that this single dominant anthracnose resistance gene in paloma to be temporarily named as co-pa, until a new designation is defined by the genetics committee of the bean improvement cooperative.

future efforts will focus on fine mapping of the  <dig>  bp region in pv <dig> containing the co-pa, the resistance gene in paloma. co-x and co-1
 <dig> anthracnose resistance genes have been closely mapped to co-pa. thus, genetic analysis of segregating populations from the cross between paloma and cultivars containing co-1
 <dig> and co-x will be the subject of future studies.

the co-pa anthracnose resistant gene in paloma provides resistance to the mesoamerican races  <dig> and  <dig> of c. lindemuthianum that overcome the most of known resistance genes in common bean. furthermore, the co-pa gene in paloma confers resistance to these and many other mesoamerican races. on the other hand, the mesoamerican genes co- <dig> and its alleles, co- <dig>  co- <dig> and other anthracnose mesoamerican resistant genes confer effective resistance to andean races that overcome the resistance of co-pa and other andean resistance genes.

these results suggest that combining co-pa with mesoamerican resistant genes in a single cultivar will confer effective and possibly durable resistance to all known races of the highly variable anthracnose pathogen of common bean. in addition, the flanking snp markers ss <dig> and ss <dig> linked to resistance gene co-pa of paloma, will be very useful for gene pyramiding of co-pa with other mesoamerican and andean genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here showed that paloma cultivar has a new dominant gene conferring resistance to anthracnose, which is independent from the co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co-3

, co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co- <dig> genes, previously described. this gene, provisionally named as co-pa gene in paloma, was mapped on the chromosome pv <dig> of common bean at 390 kb region, flanked by snp markers ss <dig> and ss <dig>  the linkage between these markers and the co-pa gene will be extremely important for marker-assisted introgression of the gene into elite cultivars in order to enhance resistance.
