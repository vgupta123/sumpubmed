BACKGROUND
strangles, caused by streptococcus equi subsp equi , is a highly infectious upper respiratory disease that has a high morbidity rate and poses a high financial burden for the equine industry . up to 20% of recovered horses post-outbreak are persistent carriers of the organism in their guttural pouches  <cit> . carrier animals serve as a reservoir for continued spread in the equine population. bacterial culture and pcr of nasopharyngeal wash and guttural pouch lavage  specimens have been used to detect s. equi for diagnostic testing of clinical suspects and for the detection of carrier animals  <cit> . bacterial culture has been documented to have low sensitivity when there are low numbers of s. equi  <cit> . pcr is highly sensitive and specific when the target dna is present in the specimen. however, during the carrier state organisms may present at a very low number, may be shed intermittently or may be dead; yet their dna will still be detectable by pcr. practitioners must obtain multiple sequential samples from convalescing animals in order to ensure a 90% chance of true negatives before comingling with susceptible animals  <cit> .

detection of s. equi carriers is influenced by several factors that include: 1) site of specimen collection  method of sampling ; 3) culture versus pcr, 4) target gene of the pcr; and 5) dna amplification method . it is well established that s. equi is harbored in the guttural pouch and that there is intermittent shedding of organisms into the nasopharynx  <cit> . the use of flocked swabs during specimen collection has recently been implemented in human medicine because of greater recovery and elution of organisms for testing of both bacterial and viral diseases  <cit> . sampling rostral nasal passages of horses with acute strangles infection with flocked nylon swabs did not statistically improve the detection of s. equi via pcr and bacterial culture  <cit> . sampling the horse nasopharynx with flocked nylon swabs for the detection of s. equi has not been investigated.

the identification of a more specific gene target for s. equi detection by pcr is constantly under investigation due to the high level of genetic homology of s. equi with streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> . in  <dig>  the eqbe gene was shown to be unique to s. equi and absent from s. zooepidemicus, thus providing a single specific gene target for real time pcr not previously available  <cit> . loop-mediated isothermal amplification  is a nucleic acid amplification method that is performed at a constant temperature and can detect target dna in less than 30 min unlike traditional pcr methods that require thermal cycling  <cit> . lamp has been used to detect s. equi in horses using both the sem gene  <cit>  and the eqbe gene  <cit> ; the latter assay was shown to be more specific  <cit> .

the reality of strangles disease in the field is that horses are treated with antibiotics to treat the infection and prevent a carrier state as quickly as possible and allow the release of the animal from quarantine. if the eqbe lamp assay is reliable for the detection of s. equi using “real world” samples from client-owned animals, then it may be possible to develop a point-of-care diagnostic assay in a hand-held device for stall-side diagnostic testing  <cit> . we hypothesized that sampling the guttural pouch would be more sensitive than sampling the nasopharynx to identify carriers of s. equi. we hypothesized that the eqbe lamp assay would be more sensitive than the real time seei pcr based on the higher specificity of the eqbe gene  <cit>  and higher efficiency of lamp over realtime pcr  <cit> . the aim of this study was to compare nasopharyngeal and guttural pouch specimens to determine the optimal sampling site to detect streptococcus equi subsp equi carriers. two dna amplification methods and two gene targets were compared.

methods
horses
this study was approved by the university of pennsylvania’s institutional animal care and use committee protocol # <dig>  all owners had informed consent and agreed to the widener-new bolton center  privately - owned animal protocol #1311– <dig>  this study was performed using naturally occurring and recovering cases of s. equi infection amongst new bolton center field service equine patients. signalment was recorded. horses were confirmed as previously infected with s. equi , and recovered from clinically apparent disease for at least  <dig> to 3 weeks. time from the start of clinical signs to sample collection was recorded. antibiotic history was recorded. all horses were sedated with detomidine   <dig> – <dig>  mg/kg of body weight for the procedures and were administered one dose of flunixin meglimine   <dig>  mg/kg of body weight after the procedure as an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent. samples were collected using  <dig> different sampling site strategies, and tested using  <dig> different s. equi identification methods.

samples
three samples were collected from each horse in the following order. a nasopharyngeal flocked nylon swab was performed using a 100 mm flocked swab  taped to a  <dig>  cm uterine polyvinyl chloride pipette. the flocked swab was then removed from the pipette and placed in the tube and media of a culturette  for transport to the laboratory. second, a nasopharyngeal wash was performed as previously described by the intranasal administration of 50 ml of sterile saline  <cit> , and third, an endoscopically-guided guttural pouch lavage was performed through a closed system of sterile polyethylene tubing passed through the instrument channel in the sedated, standing horse  <cit> . the endoscope was cleaned with chlorohexidine , rinsed with sterile water, and disinfected for 10 min with ortho-phthalaldehyde solution  between each horse on the farm. the following tests were performed on the samples:nasopharyngeal flocked swab eqbe lamp assay for s. equi


nasopharyngeal wash eqbe lamp assay for s. equi


guttural pouch lavage 



s. equi culture


s. equi seei pcr


s. equi eqbe lamp assay.




visual examination of the guttural pouch was performed at the time of sampling through the endoscope on an attached video screen. briefly, the endoscope was passed via the ventral meatus of the nasal passage, into the nasopharynx, and through the guttural pouch openings sequentially  <cit> .

diagnostic testing
all diagnostic testing  was performed at the university of pennsylvania nbc clinical microbiology laboratory, which is an aavld accredited laboratory.

seei pcr assay
the seei pcr assay has been previously validated  <cit> . the limit of detection  <cit>  and its use in detection of s. equi in clinical nasopharyngeal wash samples and guttural pouch lavage samples from sick, convalescent, and asymptomatic horses  <cit>  has been published by our laboratory. dna was extracted from a 1 ml aliquot of the guttural pouch lavage using prepman ultra as described by the manufacturer . the lavage fluid was centrifuged  for 3 min at  <dig>  × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of prepman ultra and boiled for 10 min at 100 °c. the boiled extract was then diluted 1/ <dig> in nuclease-free water prior to pcr   <cit> .

realtime pcr was performed with the following primers and probe as previously described by our laboratory  <cit> .

seei-r 5’-ttccttcctcaaagccaga-3’


seei probe 5’-tttggccgctcctctagatttcaa-3’

the positive control was s. equi atcc  <dig> and positive and negative controls were run with each assay. each pcr reaction consisted of 20 μl of a commercial l mastermix  plus 5 μl of extracted dna for a final concentration of  <dig> u taq, 200 μm dntps, 4 mm mgcl <dig> and 25 mm hepes. amplification began with 8 min at 95 °c, followed by 45 cycles of 20 s at 95 °c and 60 s at 60 °c. no internal amplification control was included.

bacterial culture
a culturette  was submerged in the vortexed fluid sample, plated on a blood agar plate , becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj), aerobically incubated at 35 °c overnight, and read at  <dig> and 48 h. beta-hemolytic, organisms that were also catalase negative were subcultured to a blood agar plate and incubated at 35 °c overnight. isolates were then identified biochemically using a commercial system. sensititre panel . in addition to this, isolates were subcultured to cystine trypticase agar  with lactose and cta with sorbitol  and incubated at 35 °c overnight. streptococcus equi subsp equi does not ferment sorbitol or lactose in contrast to streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus. presumptive streptococcus equi subsp equi isolates were confirmed to be lancefield group c using a commercial latex agglutination system. 

lamp assay
the s. equi eqbe lamp assay was performed for research purposes at the matthew j. ryan veterinary hospital  of the university of pennsylvania research microbiology laboratory  <cit> . research personnel at ryan vhup were blinded to seei pcr results obtained at nbc and had no information on the clinical status of the animal from which samples were obtained. the eqbe lamp assay was performed using primers that were designed with the primerexplorer v <dig> software . the gene sequence used was based on genbank accession : am <dig>  streptococcus equi subsp. equi integrative conjugative element icese <dig>  strain  <dig>  the analytical sensitivity of eqbe lamp was determined by using a 10-fold serial dilution  of atcc 33398 s. equi subsp. equi genomic dna . the eqbe lamp was carried out in a reaction mixture of 25 μl containing  <dig>  μm of each outer primer ,  <dig>  μm of each inner primer ,  <dig>  μm of loop primer , 1x isothermal master mix , and approximately 20–100 ng of genomic dna. dna was extracted from a 1 ml aliquot of the guttural pouch lavage as previously described above . amplification began with 30 min at 65 °c followed by 2 min at 80 °c to terminate the reaction. positive and negative controls were genomic dna from atcc  <dig> streptococcus equi subsp. equi and reaction mixture without dna, respectively.

the eqbe lamp assay was tested for inclusivity with a panel of  <dig> well-defined s. equi subsp. equi isolates and showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. the analytical specificity  was determined using a panel of  <dig> strains: s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae , staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, salmonella typhmimurium, haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium ulcerans and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis.

guttural pouch endoscopy
all horses had guttural pouch endoscopy performed. the presence or absence of empyema, defined as any gross purulent material in guttural pouch or within the lavaged fluid, in either guttural pouch was recorded. an endoscopic evaluation of “normal” or “abnormal” was recorded for the guttural pouches of each horse. an abnormal guttural pouch was defined when one or more of the following characteristics were found in either the left or the right guttural pouch: empyema, abnormal appearance to the respiratory epithelial lining, and/or visually enlarged retropharyngeal lymph nodes on the floor of the guttural pouch.

statistical analysis
all statistical analysis was performed using computerized software . logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio  of detection of s. equi based on the sampling methods . the status of infection  was determined using eqbe lamp pcr. a p-value of ≤  <dig>  was used to determine the significance of each statistical test. we adjusted for any potential confounding of the use of any antibiotic treatment , the time from the last antibiotic treatment, and the number of days prior to eqbe lamp testing that the sample was taken by determining their statistical significance in the logistic regression model  <cit> .

RESULTS
one hundred and twenty-three samples were analyzed :  <dig> nasopharyngeal flocked swabs,  <dig> nasopharyngeal washes, and  <dig> guttural pouch lavages were obtained from  <dig> different horses on  <dig> separate occasions from all  <dig> different strangles outbreaks that occurred from november  <dig> to november 2014 . on  <dig> occasions, the attending clinician neglected to obtain the nasopharyngeal samples and an additional  <dig> nasopharyngeal wash samples were lost during transport to the research laboratory. breeds consisted of  <dig> standardbreds,  <dig> quarter horses,  <dig> thoroughbreds,  <dig> warmbloods,  <dig> draft horses, and one miniature horse. seventeen horses were female,  <dig> were geldings, and  <dig> were male. the median age was 3 years . the median time from start of clinical signs to sampling collection was 3 months .fig.  <dig> flow chart of antibiotic history, sample collection, diagnostics, results, and guttural pouchcharacteristics of  <dig> different s. equi convalescent horses obtained on  <dig> different occassions




a total of 31/ <dig> samples  were positive by eqbe lamp: 1/ <dig> nasopharyngeal flocked swab , 6/ <dig>  nasopharyngeal wash and 24/ <dig>  guttural pouch lavages. eighteen of  <dig>  guttural pouch lavage samples were positive by seei pcr. the median cycle threshold  value was  <dig>  . a seei real-time pcr sample was considered negative if the ct value was ≥ 40 cycles. s. equi was isolated via bacterial culture from 4/ <dig>  guttural pouch lavage samples  <cit> , all of which were also positive by seei pcr and eqbe lamp. all horses that had a positive sample from the nasopharynx  were also positive in the guttural pouch. seventeen  and  <dig>  of  <dig> horses had normal and abnormal endoscopic examinations of the guttural pouch, respectively. thirty-one  of  <dig> horses had no empyema whereas  <dig>  of  <dig> horses had very mild empyema found on endoscopic examination of the guttural pouches. one horse required guttural pouch lavage to clear the particulate matter for clinical reasons. one of  <dig> horses was positive by seei pcr and had a normal endoscopic examination with no empyema.

eighteen of  <dig> horses  had a treatment history of systemic antibiotics:  <dig>  received procaine penicillin g ,  <dig>  received ceftiofur , and  <dig>  received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole . four of the  <dig> horses   had a treatment history of antibiotic usage in the guttural pouch with penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin . in the  <dig> horses that were treated with antibiotics , all antibiotic treatments finished a median of 3 weeks prior to sampling . all samples were sent to ryan vhup and eqbe lamp testing was performed a median of 1 day after collection . the use of antibiotics and the number of days following their use that sample collection occurred could affect the positive or negative status of the sample. the number of days after sample collection the eqbe lamp testing was performed may affect the viability of the bacteria within the sample. all three independent variables were added to the  <dig> logistic models since they may confound the associations between eqbe lamp and the outcomes.

the first logistic model estimated the association between eqbe lamp and the location of sampling. when using the eqbe lamp assay on  <dig> total samples, the guttural pouch lavage was  <dig> times more likely to be positive for s. equi dna than the nasopharyngeal flocked swab and the nasopharyngeal wash samples . when the eqbe lamp results of  <dig> guttural pouch lavage samples were positive, the guttural pouch was eight times more likely to have any abnormality on endoscopy , almost  <dig> times more likely to find mild empyema , and the seei pcr was eight times more likely to be positive for s. equi dna . table  <dig> shows the sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operator curves for all four logistic models. all models were normalized for the number of days before eqbe lamp testing, antibiotic use, and time from last antibiotic treatment to sample collection.table  <dig> sensitivity and specificity comparing 1)  <dig> eqbe lamp results to the sample type  versus not ); 2) eqbe lamp results from  <dig> gpl samples to abnormal guttural pouch endoscopic findings; 3) eqbe lamp from  <dig> gpl samples to empyema found on guttural pouch endoscopy; 4) eqbe lamp to seei pcr from  <dig> gpl samples

discussion
this study provides strong evidence that the eqbe lamp assay performed with guttural pouch specimens is more sensitive for the detection of s. equi than nasopharyngeal flocked swab or a nasopharyngeal wash taken from the same horse at the same time. the  <dig> american college of veterinary internal medicine consensus statement recommendation for the detection of s. equi carriers is to obtain  <dig> negative nasopharyngeal washes or swab pcr samples over a 3 week period in order for an animal to be considered free of the organism. if the animal is found to be positive, endoscopic examination of the guttural pouch is strongly recommended  <cit> . the data presented here show that a single guttural pouch lavage nucleic acid amplification test in conjunction with visual examination of the guttural pouches in the convalescent period provides a cost and time efficiency to determine s. equi status of an animal


eqbe lamp was found to have acceptable discrimination when seei pcr is considered as a true measure of outcome . the sensitivity and specificity of eqbe lamp were lower when compared to the eqbe real time pcr results reported by north, 95% and 86%, respectively  <cit> . this is also true when compared to the triplex quantitative pcr reported by webb, et al. that reported a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 97%  <cit> . these previous studies compared samples from horses at all stages of disease  and from all types of samples  which inherently means that the bacterial counts  varied from very high  to very low   <cit> . this study provides validation for the use of eqbe lamp assay on the typical samples that are tested at the end of an outbreak to clear a patient/farm from quarantine, the guttural pouches of outwardly healthy convalescent horses that have very low bacterial counts but that could still be infective. the gpl culture that was performed adhered to the diagnostic lab protocol and a 10 μl aliquot was plated to the can plate. this volume is considerably less than the 1 ml that was centrifuged for dna extraction and this could have affected the culture results for those samples  that were positive on dna amplification and culture negative. an important incidental finding is that the culture data shows a massive die-off occurred in the guttural pouch in the interval between acute phase strangles and convalescence and is consistent with recent studies in the uk showing s. equi undergoes genetic decay in the guttural pouch including loss of genes necessary for virulence and infectivity  <cit> . this study found flocked swab sampling of the nasopharynx to be a poor method for testing with the eqbe lamp pcr to detect s. equi in outwardly healthy convalescent horses. this is in contrast to the improved bacterial recovery that has been found in human medicine sampling and laboratory processing when using flocked swabs  <cit> . other veterinary researchers have found that the use of flocked nylon swabs did not improve the detection of s. equi by pcr and bacterial culture of the rostral nasal passages in acute strangles infection  <cit> . this is the first report showing the lack of performance of flocked swabs in the nasopharynx and the convalescent horse.

at the start of this study, the triplex pcr developed by webb et al.  <cit>  was published, but was not available for research use due to commercial patenting. seei is a gene that encodes a superantigenic toxin  <cit>  that is a virulence factor of s. equi  <cit> . concerns with the seei pcr include a potential lack of specificity between s. equi subsp equi and subsp zooepidemicus due to shared genes for superantigens that may lead to false positive results with some s. zooepidemicus strains  <cit> . in addition, s. equi isolated from some persistent carriers have been shown to have deletions in the variable region of the sem gene that leads to a false negative test result, although deletions of eqbe have also been documented  <cit> . we attempted to address these limitations by comparing the eqbe lamp results to alternative phenotypic or clinical gold standards  that would make a clinician suspicious that a s. equi convalescent horse is still positive. guttural pouch abnormalities including empyema were a good predictor of a positive eqbe lamp assay result. positive lamp or pcr in normal guttural pouches may be the result of biofilm on the respiratory epithelium  <cit> 

ideally, performing seei pcr on all  <dig> samples, including all the nasopharyngeal samples would have provided a larger number of samples in which to compare the tests, but was beyond the financial scope of this study. the study met its power calculation recommendations of  <dig> samples. we did not include the traditional swab as an additional sample collection method, but nasopharyngeal wash has already been shown to be more sensitive than the traditional nasopharyngeal swab  <cit> . it would have been ideal to compare  <dig> nasopharyngeal washes over  <dig> separate weeks in the same horse to one guttural pouch of that horse, but this would be difficult due to the prolonged sampling period and quarantine necessary for this infectious disease in client-owned animals. the current strangles consensus statement is currently under revision to reflect the research advances over the last 11 years. it is known that s. equi is intermittently shed from the guttural pouch into the nasopharynx  <cit> . horses that have had  <dig> pcr negative consecutive nasopharyngeal samples have been shown to infect naïve herdmates  <cit> . unfortunately, it is not yet possible to quantitatively predict the risk of extended survival of live s. equi in the abnormal empyemic guttural pouch. the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of eqbe lamp in a “real world” situation during the aggressive sample collection time period , which includes all the possible confounders associated with treating client-owned animals such as antibiotic treatments and time constraints on quarantines. the statistical analysis attempted to account for these confounders.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated the guttural pouch as the preferred anatomic site to sample to detect s. equi dna in outwardly healthy convalescent horses using the eqbe lamp assay. when used in conjunction with visual examination of the guttural pouch it provides evidence to eliminate the need for repeat testing with nasopharyngeal washes or swabs, thus saving time and money. since the lamp assay that targets the eqbe gene has acceptable agreement with the seei pcr, further field verification of the eqbe lamp in a point-of-care device  <cit>  that will enable stall side testing performed by the field veterinarian is warranted.
