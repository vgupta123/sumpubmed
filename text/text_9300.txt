BACKGROUND
preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, has a global prevalence of  <dig>  %. it is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality and is responsible for approximately 70 % of all neonatal deaths and 40 % of childhood neurological morbidities  <cit> . one third of preterm births are iatrogenic because of maternal or fetal reasons, usually in relation to maternal hypertensive disease. two thirds occur as a consequence of idiopathic preterm delivery initiated by either spontaneous preterm labor  with intact membranes or preterm premature rupture of membranes   <cit> .

the initiating mechanisms behind the inappropriate early activation of labor are poorly understood. known risk factors include uterine anomalies, multiple gestations, polyhydramnios, blood loss, infection and previous preterm birth  <cit> . there are no early diagnostic or prognostic markers for spontaneous preterm birth.

the timing of delivery is an intricate play between the fetus, uterus, decidua and placenta. fetal growth increasing the tension in the uterine wall, increased oxytocin and estrogen bioactivity, progesterone withdrawal and inflammatory decidual activation, all contribute to the initiation of contractions  <cit> . for several populations susceptibility loci influencing preterm birth have been reported, but until now this has not resulted in the identification of additional general mechanisms involved in preterm labor . it is currently not known if there are other fetal properties, apart from fetal growth, that relate to the premature onset of delivery.

epigenetics is an important regulatory mechanism contributing to the control of gene expression. it has been suggested that epigenetics is involved in idiopathic preterm delivery in humans  <cit> . dna methylation in myometrium is known to contribute to the functional progesterone withdrawal associated with labor  <cit> . the amnion shows significant methylation changes in the promoter region of the oxytocin receptor gene between preterm and term labor  <cit> . cervical dna methylation has also been associated with gestational length  <cit> .

although a few studies reported the differential dna methylation profile of umbilical cord blood  in relation to preterm delivery, the overall emerging picture is complicated by variability in mode of delivery, limitations to specific ethnicity, the absence of information on the progression of labor after initiation of contractions and the inclusion of patients with hypertensive disease .

in the current study, we investigate the genome-wide methylation profile in ucb from  <dig> preterm and  <dig> matched term neonates all born after vaginal delivery from normotensive pregnancies and identify genes that could function as leads to establish early diagnostic markers for idiopathic preterm delivery.

RESULTS
sample cohort
we selected  <dig> ucb samples from neonates born after normotensive singleton pregnancies that presented headfirst and were vaginally delivered . gestational age at delivery ranged from 26 weeks and 3 days to 41 weeks and 4 days; delivery before 37 weeks of gestation was considered preterm. two samples had to be excluded because of reasons described extensively below resulting in the analysis of  <dig> samples. neonatal birth percentile specific for parity, neonatal sex and gestational age was calculated based on the dutch neonatal growth charts . apart from the gestational age of delivery, neonatal weight and treatment with antenatal glucocorticoids, all characteristics intrinsic to the gestational age at birth, there are no clinical differences between groups .table  <dig> maternal and fetal characteristics of the ucb study cohort

neonatal sex chromosomal variations detected by dna methylation profiling of umbilical cord blood
the illumina 450 k beadchip array was used to determine methylation status in our ucb cohort. as an initial check for sample integrity, the  <dig> samples of the original dataset were grouped as males or females based on their phenotype at birth  multi-dimensional scaling  analysis was performed on raw intensity signals as a quality control step using the champ package, which resulted in a male neonate born at term  clustering together with the females in our dataset . levels of probe intensity suggested that this sample gained one x chromosome. this finding was validated on dna isolated from placenta tissue from this pregnancy that was available through our panda biobank project using quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction  . the qf-pcr signal pattern for markers dxs <dig>  hprt, and taf <dig>  are consistent with the presence of  <dig> x chromosomes. the signal from sry  marker confirms the presence of a y chromosome. the signal pattern for amel  is consistent with two x chromosomes and one y chromosome. the copy number analysis for chromosome x and y showed evidence of an xxy chromosomal pattern concordant with klinefelter syndrome. this sample was excluded from further methylation analysis .fig.  <dig> neonatal sex chromosomal variations detected through quality control of umbilical cord blood illumina 450 k data. a multi-dimensional scaling  plot on neonatal sex on the top  <dig> methylation variable positions between male  and female  samples; t4-klinefilter neonate. b validation of the x-chromosomal gain of neonate t <dig> by qf-pcr supporting the diagnosis of klinefelter syndrome: markers dxs <dig> , hprt , taf9l , dxs <dig>  are specific for the x chromosome. markers sry  and amel /  are specific for the y chromosome



genome-wide methylation differences in umbilical cord blood dna between preterm and term infants at birth
the array quality metrics package  <cit>  was used to check for quality of the array data and we identified one outlying sample with signal intensity strongly deviating from all other samples. this sample  was excluded from further analysis .

differential methylation analysis was performed on  <dig> preterm and  <dig> term dna samples isolated from ucb. we identified  <dig> statistically significant differentially methylated positions  , of which,  <dig> dmps can be solely attributed to methylation differences between infants born preterm and term. for the comparisons male vs female, no-stimulation vs stimulation with oxytocin and initiation with ptlb vs pprom, the number of dmps unique for the comparison groups are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . the remaining  <dig> dmps were shared by  <dig> or more groups .fig.  <dig> differentially methylated positions  in umbilical cord blood dna between preterm and term infants. a venn diagram depicting the differentially methylated cpg sites within each of the four comparison groups . false discovery rate . b illustration of the distribution of dmps over gene regions for all comparison groups. the tss200: region  <dig> base pairs within the transcription start site ; tss: region  <dig> base pairs within the tss excluding the tss  <dig> region; utr: untranslated region as present in the mrna molecule respectively 5′ of the transcription start site  and 3′ of the termination signal ; body: coding and non-coding regions from the tss until the termination codon; igr: intergenic region



for all comparison groups 35-40 % of dmps are present in gene bodies  reflecting the distribution of probes available on the array, of which 33 % are present in gene bodies.

correlation of unique term vs preterm dmps with clinical variables
a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed, in order to identify the clinical variables that associated with the  <dig> dmps identified in the term vs preterm group . the dmps group into  <dig> main clusters based on gestational age; strictly preterm , intermediate  and term  . 1-way anova with  <dig> degrees of freedom shows that the median gravidity of the intermediate group is significantly higher when compared to the strictly preterm group . a pearson correlation test was used to identify the degree of correlation of every dmp with gestational age controlling the fdr at  <dig> . of the total  <dig> dmps,  <dig> dmps correlate significantly with gestational age of which  <dig> dmps with a positive and  <dig> dmps with a negative correlation to gestational age . the dmps located on gene regions with the highest correlation of gestational age with a negative correlation are ncor <dig>  dnajc <dig>  pycr <dig>  atp6v0a <dig>  rara and fbln <dig> and dmps with a positive correlation are igf2bp <dig>  otof, atp2b <dig>  ces <dig> and myh7b. the methylation trend of the majority of gestational age related dmps increases with advancing gestation and within this set are  <dig> dmps localising to the esr <dig> gene .fig.  <dig> correlation of birth dmps with gestational age. panel a heat map illustration of the clustering of the birth dmps with gestational age. average linkage clustering was performed on beta values based on the correlation distance between the preterm and term group. pt1-pt12: preterm and t1-t12: term umbilical cord blood dna. panel b clinical characteristics of the study cohort on the left with scaling on the right and colors reflecting the clusters on the top of panel a. panel c pearson correlation with gestational age. black bars indicate significant correlation 



the remaining  <dig> dmps that do not correlate with gestational age reflect the systematic difference between both groups. dmps on kiaa <dig>  ube <dig> and ap3d <dig> have the highest absolute difference between groups with a p value < <dig>  .

pathway analysis
pathway analysis was performed for all the dmps identified in each individual comparison group. the gene symbols of the observed dmps were imported into web-gestalt  <cit>  and wiki pathway enrichment analysis was performed with fdr at  <dig> . the  <dig> dmps specific for the comparison of initiation with ptlb vs pprom could not be assigned to specific pathways. among the top enriched pathways in the term vs preterm ucb group, are mapk signalling, myometrial relaxation and contraction pathway and tgf beta signalling pathway  . the pathway involving calcium regulation in cardiac cell is observed in all  <dig> comparison groups. both the term vs preterm and the male vs female comparisons showed an enrichment in myometrial relaxation and contraction pathway, insulin signalling and signalling pathways in glioblastoma. although the pathways indicated are the same, the genes allocated to them are different, with the exception of slc8a <dig> 

linkage to other studies
to complement our approach of methylation analysis with relevance to preterm birth we compared dmps identified in our study to dmps identified by two other studies on cord blood methylation using the illumina beadchip technology . in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> dmps that are uniquely assigned to the term versus preterm comparison have been reported previously  <cit> . we identified dmps on esr <dig>  tmem184a and gp1bb that have been previously associated with gestational age in the schroeder study  <cit> . dmps in  <dig> genes, including those on igf2bp <dig>  adora2a and gabbr <dig>  have been reported by cruickshank study  <cit> . a single dmp on the gene encoding myosin light chain  <dig> , in the transcription start site  <dig>  or 5′untranslated region  depending on the definition of the 5′ prime end of the transcript, is identified by all  <dig> studies. the current study confirms  <dig> of the total  <dig> dmps that were differentially methylated at birth and 18 years of age originally identified in the cruikshank study. these  <dig> dmps correspond to  <dig> genes .fig.  <dig> comparison of dmps with other study cohorts. venn diagram with large circles reflecting the different study cohorts showing the number of individual and shared dmps between studies. green shading reflects all dmps were the level of methylation correlates with gestational age in the current study. smaller inner circle represents  <dig> dmps that were observed as differentially methylated both at birth and at 18 years of age originally identified in the cruikshank study. the current study confirms  <dig> of them 



the  <dig> dmps in the current ucb study that show no correlation with gestational age do not overlap with the  <dig> dmps that associate with preterm birth adjusted for gestational age reported previously. of these  <dig>  the dmp cg <dig> in our study shows a negative correlation with gestational age. the other  <dig> are not identified as dmps in the current study  <cit> .

ucb differentially methylated regions  between term and preterm neonates
with a fdr at  <dig> , we identified  <dig> differentially methylated regions  between preterm and term neonates;  <dig> non-annotated regions, a non-coding rna  and  <dig> genes . out of the  <dig>   <dig> of the identified dmrs are located on chromosome  <dig>  the genes with dmrs were queried for go biological processes. the top  <dig> dmrs are located on genes involved in neuronal development such as ppt <dig>  gabbr <dig>  plekhb <dig> and induction of immunity such as zc3h12d  <cit> . interestingly adora2a, a gene involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway, was identified as a dmr covering  <dig> dmps in this analysis .table  <dig> gene annotations of differentially methylated regions in ucb dna from term and preterm born neonates

discussion
dna methylation plays an important role in gene regulation and in the etiology of complex diseases  <cit> . ucb dna is an easily available source and relevant for the fetal state at the moment of birth. the umbilical cord blood dna comprises of a mixed population of all types of blood cells and other tissue cells that have entered the circulation. however, the extent to which the dna methylation profile of ucb reflects those in other tissues is still a matter of debate. fetal dna is detectable in the maternal circulation early in pregnancy facilitating non-invasive prenatal testing  <cit> . recent developments have shown that the fetal methylome is also accessible from maternal plasma, thus enhancing the opportunity to determine fetal epigenetic markers in the maternal circulation  <cit> .

in the current study, we characterize the methylation profile in ucb dna specific to spontaneous preterm delivery, neonatal sex, use of oxytocin and mode of initiation of labor using the illumina 450 k bead chip. this technical approach is also evidently able to reveal copy number aberrations, as we encountered a  <dig>  xxy neonate in our sample cohort.

there is evidence suggesting gender-specific differences to the susceptibility and progression of some diseases . some studies have shown that preterm born females have a better survival rate and neurological outcome compared to preterm males . there is no functional data proving epigenetics as causal to gender differences but the current study indicated some putative associations. we identified  <dig> autosomal dmps that differ between males and females irrespective of the preterm/term status. within this group are dmps located on prkcz, gbe <dig> and gyg. prkcz in cord blood t cells has been associated with allergy risk in infants and it has been reported that gender differences affect susceptibility to the development of hypersensitivity reactions  <cit> . the prkcz gene has also been linked to development of bipolar disorder  <cit>  in line with the increased risk of psychiatric illness such as bipolar disorder in males compared to females  <cit> .

similarly we also established dmps in certain cpg sites specific to oxytocin usage to induce or stimulate labor. some of the dmps in the oxytocin vs no-oxytocin group are cacna1d, adcy <dig> and itga <dig>  according to kegg pathways both cacna1d and adcy <dig> are linked to the oxytocin signalling pathway. in-vivo studies show that α3β <dig> integrin  mediated signalling contributes to the control of amplitude and duration of contractions in response to oxytocin in mammary myoepithelial cells  <cit> .

the number of dmps specific to spontaneous contractions vs spontaneous rupture of membranes comparison is too small to perform pathway analysis.

the majority of methylation differences in our study cohort are between preterm versus term pregnancies. the  <dig> dmps solely attributable to term versus preterm birth were mainly observed in gene bodies, intergenic regions and within  <dig> basepairs of the transcription start site, reflecting the number of probes present in these regions. about 85 % of the  <dig> dmps observed in ucb of neonates born term vs preterm have a clear relation with advancing gestational age. this has been reported before and is assumed to reflect the haematological changes as leucocyte content, nucleated reticulocyte content and maturation of red blood cells, all of which strongly correlate with gestational age . in the current cohort gestational ages range from 26+ <dig> to 41+ <dig> weeks. hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> dmps separates early preterm from term deliveries and identifies an intermediate gestational age group  with a statistically significant higher gravidity. the remaining  <dig> dmps represent which do not correlate with gestational age represent systematic differences between the preterm and term born neonates and have not been reported previously in relation to preterm delivery. a study interrogating methylation patterns in ucb dna from african-americans identified  <dig> cpg sites associated with preterm birth adjusted for gestational age. none of those were corroborated by the current study  <cit> . wiki pathway analysis and gene enrichment of our set of  <dig> dmps shows calcium and tgf beta signalling, myometrial contraction and relaxation pathways and the corticotrophin releasing hormone pathway. it is well established that calcium signalling is crucial in the human myometrium for initiation of labor  <cit> . the genes which are represented in the myometrial contraction and relaxation pathways are sodium and calcium exchanger slc8a <dig>  which also plays a role in cardiomyocyte contractions, chemokine receptor cxcr <dig>  guanine nucleotide binding protein gng <dig> and transmembrane signalling enzyme phospholipase c plcg <dig> respectively. further research will have to determine if they are putative foetal biomarkers for idiopathic preterm delivery that can be analysed from the maternal circulation.

ideally high-thoughput data from clinical samples need to be validated either by additional experiments or comparative validation to other studies. the limitation of the current study is that we have not experimentally validated this finding. however, we have approached this issue with detailed comparison of previously published independent studies on ucb methylation. there have been  <dig> previous reports on dna methylation profiles in ucb analysed with respect to gestational age at delivery using the illumina platform . the study by schroeder et al. analysed  <dig> ucb samples with gestational age ranging from  <dig> to 43 weeks of gestation on a 27 k platform. results were adjusted for a number of clinical variables including neonatal sex and parity and they showed that associations were independent of the method of delivery or induction of labor. the study by cruickshank et al., interrogated both ucb and blood at 18 years of age of  <dig> preterm  and  <dig> term  born neonates using the 450 k platform. two thirds of the mothers did not experience labor. for both these studies gravidity was not reported.

the  <dig> dmps which overlap between our study and the above mentioned studies provide increased evidence of presence of these methylation differences in ucb of preterm and term infants at birth. the overlapping dmps on esr <dig> and myl <dig> are of interest in the context of preterm delivery. increased esr <dig>  gene expression in the myometrium is triggered by functional progesterone withdrawal and results in increased estrogen bioactivity, an important contributor to the transition from myometrial quiescence to synchronised contractions  <cit> . as all our neonates were delivered vaginally, we cannot exclude the fact that labor is associated with the differential methylation of the esr <dig> gene. however, based on the study of schroeder which also included samples from neonates delivered by caesarean section, this seems unlikely.

myl <dig> encodes myosin light chain  <dig> that is essential to the myometrial contraction pathway. myl <dig> expression in mice myometrium is downregulated over two-fold during quiescence indicating an active role in the progression to myometrial contractions  <cit> .

a single dmp  on c17orf <dig> identified by the cruickshank study as relating to gestational age is uniquely attributable to neonatal sex in our study. the  <dig> overlapping dmps with cruickshank study which has been experimentally validated to be present at 18 years of age is of significance due to the long-term consequence of preterm birth.

dmr analysis identifies  <dig> significant differentially methylated regions. the most significant dmr is located on the ppt <dig> gene on chromosome 6p <dig>  and covers  <dig> dmps. ppt <dig> is located on the major histocompatibility locus  and its deficiency in homozygous knock out mice causes a neurodegenerative disorder  <cit> . there are  <dig> other dmrs present on 6p <dig>  corresponding to ddr <dig> with 13dmps and psmb <dig> with 3dmps. zc3h12d activates tlr signalling in macrophages and plays a role in immunity and inflammatory diseases. the inflammatory pathway is a well-established important contributor to the initiation of synchronised myometrial contractions and interestingly the differential methylation of zc3h12d has been shown to persist until at least the age of 18 years  <cit> . the adora2a encodes the adenosine a2a receptor, a member of the g-protein coupled receptor superfamily. interleukin-1b activates myometrial inflammation and is able to up regulate adora2a expression > <dig> fold in primary culture of pregnant human uterine myocytes  <cit> . adora2a, also reported by the cruickshank study, shows a relative increased methylation status in ucb dna of neonates born after idiopathic preterm labor.

comparing the methylation and gene expression profiles of myometrium, placenta and umbilical cord blood of preterm and term deliveries could shed more light on the functional relevance of the methylation changes observed in the cord blood dna.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identifies  <dig> methylation changes in umbilical cord blood specific to idiopathic preterm delivery. the approach to methylation analysis in this study also delineates methylation changes specific to neonatal sex giving more insight into sex-specific autosomal methylation differences at birth enhancing the understanding of gender specific susceptibility to a specific disease.

in addition, the identification of  <dig> dmps which overlap with other studies offer supportive evidence of robust methylation differences in ucb between preterm and term infants. meta-analysis of raw data sets of these independent studies combined with detailed information on clinical data will provide a more robust set of dmps which can be used as diagnostic markers for spontaneous preterm delivery.
