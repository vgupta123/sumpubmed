BACKGROUND
initially reported as a major cause of hospital-acquired infections in humans, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  has increasingly been reported as responsible for community-acquired infections as well as for infections in animals. possible transmission of mrsa between humans and animals has raised concern about the role of animals as major reservoirs of mrsa clones involved in human infections . although mrsa strains are usually resistant to β-lactams through the acquisition of the meca gene, a homolog gene  has been recently reported both in animal and human populations . it is well known that mrsa is responsible for a large variety of infections in numerous animals; however, specific studies in horses are scarce . indeed, some studies have demonstrated that horses are colonized and infected by mrsa clones that commonly belong to the sequence type  <dig> and related sts within the clonal complex  <dig>  <cit> . more recently, studies from europe and canada reported horses to be colonized by mrsa clones belonging to st <dig>  designated livestock-associated -mrsa, which is primarily recognized as a colonizer of pigs and pig farmers  <cit> . la-mrsa st <dig> can be responsible for infections in humans in close contact with animals. phenotypically, la-mrsa st <dig> is generally susceptible to antibiotics other than β-lactams even if it is characteristically resistant to tetracyclines  <cit> . note that almost all equine mrsa isolates carry meca while mecc has been rarely detected so far  <cit> . from an epidemiological point of view, the prevalence of mrsa in horse infections has been poorly investigated in france  <cit>  and most importantly there is no data on nationwide molecular epidemiology.

the aim of the study was then 1) to evaluate the prevalence of mrsa isolated from horse clinical samples recovered between  <dig> and  <dig> in france, and 2) to extensively characterize phenotypically and genotypically this large collection of equine mrsa strains.

RESULTS
prevalence of mrsa isolates
from  <dig> to  <dig>  the laboratory received  <dig>  horse clinical samples with the recovery of  <dig>  different bacterial isolates. s. aureus was the third most frequent bacterial species isolated  after group c streptococcus  and escherichia coli . out of the  <dig> s. aureus horse isolates,  <dig>  were categorized as mrsa . interestingly, the prevalence of mrsa significantly increased from 2007– <dig> to 2010– <dig>  . they were recovered from different sources of infection: skin and soft-tissue , genital tract , respiratory tract , bone and joint  and others . note that mrsa isolates were collected from  <dig> different stud farms located in  <dig> different french departments , mainly representing the northwestern parts of france . this roughly corresponds to the actual geographical distribution of stud farms with a high number of them in normandy. no isolate harboured pvl and tst toxin genes .table  <dig> prevalence of mrsa from  <dig> to 2013

antimicrobial resistance profiles
resistance to methicillin was associated with the presence of the meca gene in  <dig> isolates  while the mecc gene was detected in only one strain isolated in  <dig>  . note that this mecc-positive strain was susceptible to all other antibiotics . a vast majority  were resistant to aminoglycosides with a ktg  phenotype, which was due to the presence of the aac-aph gene in all cases . concerning macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  antibiotics,  <dig> strains  were resistant to erythromycin, most of them  being erm positive with an inducible mlsb resistance . almost all strains were resistant to both tested tetracyclines due to the presence of tet only  or both tet and tet genes  . some strains  were resistant to fluoroquinolones, including  <dig>  harbouring mutations in gyra and/or parc quinolone resistance-determining regions  and  <dig>  with putative active efflux . some isolates were categorized as intermediate/resistant to rifampin , cotrimoxazole  and chloramphenicol  . finally, all strains remained susceptible to glycopeptides, linezolid and fusidic acid. note that the vast majority of the strains  was multiply resistant to at least three different classes of antibiotics.table  <dig> antimicrobial resistance profiles and acquired mechanisms of resistance of the  <dig> mrsa isolates

analysis of clonal populations
according to phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance profiles,  <dig> different profiles were distinguished . mlst revealed that the majority of mrsa isolates belonged to two main sts: st <dig>  and st <dig>  . interestingly, all st <dig> mrsa isolates were detected in 2010– <dig> . by sccmec analysis, the sccmec type ivd was identified in 27/ <dig>  st <dig> isolates while the sccmec type iva found in 52/ <dig>  st <dig> isolates . the spa typing differentiated the mrsa collection into  <dig> distinct spa types. the spa types found among the st <dig> strains were as follows: t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig>  and t <dig>  . among st <dig> strains, the spa type t <dig> was largely predominant  followed by t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig>  and t <dig>  . the rep-pcr technique delineated  <dig> different clusters  with  <dig> isolates being grouped in ≥2-isolate clusters and  <dig> isolates corresponding to singletons . there was a good agreement between mlst and rep-pcr with the latter method being much more discriminative, especially within the st <dig> cluster . then, it was possible to distinguish some specific lineages related to certain geographical regions. in addition, rep-pcr had the advantage to dissect the genetic relatedness of st <dig> clones since these isolates are not typeable by pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis  using smai  <cit> .table  <dig> comparison of the results obtained by mlst, sccmec analysis and spa typing for the  <dig> mrsa horse isolates

discussion
in this study, we have showed that the prevalence of mrsa strains isolated from horse infections before  <dig> was low  in france, with st <dig> being predominant during this period. the prevalence has since increased from  <dig> to reach about 10%, and st <dig> has become the predominant mrsa lineage. these data on mrsa prevalence in equine infections are in agreement with those observed in other european veterinary hospitals: 22% in switzerland  <cit>  and 19% in germany  <cit> . however, it is important to note that mrsa isolates in our study were recovered in stud farms and not in veterinary hospitals. indeed, the lower prevalence in france observed in our study may be explained by the fact that these samples are from stud farms that are exposed to different environmental conditions and risk factors as compared to veterinary hospitals. although horses were generally hosted in french stud farms geographically distant, these results suggest a national diffusion of clonally related mrsa st <dig> and st <dig> isolates.

the meca-carrying st <dig> and st <dig> have been reported as the major strains that infected or colonized horses  <cit> . colonization and infection of horses in the usa and canada generally involve st8-type mrsa isolates, classified by pfge as canadian mrsa- <dig> or usa <dig>  <cit> . st <dig> is infrequently found in humans and is among sts isolated from horses of the clonal complex   <dig>  st8-type mrsa has also been recently isolated in australian horses  <cit> . in france, only one molecular study has been performed on mrsa isolated in horses  <cit> . in this study, only three mrsa were identified among  <dig> s. aureus equine isolates and all belonged to the st <dig>  <cit> . st398-type mrsa is a non-cc <dig> clone initially report in france in pigs  <cit> , which is currently spreading in horse clinics in europe and north america  <cit> . even if it is characteristically resistant to tetracyclines, this emerging st is generally susceptible to other antibiotics, which was quite different from what we observed in our study. indeed, we found that  <dig> out of  <dig>  st <dig> strains were multiply resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. even though multidrug resistance in mrsa is de facto defined as mdr  <cit> , it is important to highlight the very high proportion  of strains exhibiting resistant to three-to-eight antimicrobial categories. although st <dig> is associated with livestock, sporadic cases, and outbreaks in equine hospitals, colonization of horses and associated personnel have been reported in europe  <cit> . recently, a suspected transmission of mrsa st <dig> from a horse to a dutch girl, which resulted in a foot infection, has been reported  <cit> .

among other sts, st <dig>  which belong to the cc <dig>  was recently described in horses and seems to be strongly associated with equine practice veterinarians  <cit>  while st <dig>  described in pets, swine and poultry  <cit> , was recently reported in horses in japan  <cit> . finally, some authors have recently characterized in animal mrsa isolates belonging to cc <dig> , the most prevalent cc among mecc-positive strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this first epidemiological survey conducted in france has shown an increase in the prevalence of mrsa isolates associated with horse infections since  <dig> in stud farms, which is in part related to the emergence of clonally-related st <dig> mrsa isolates. since this new st <dig> type is known to cause outbreaks in horses and to colonize/infect humans, hygiene measures and appropriate antimicrobial use should be maintained and reinforced in order to limit the transmission of s. aureus between horses as well as between horses and humans.
