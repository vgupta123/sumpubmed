BACKGROUND
the modern cultivated potato  is a heterozygous autotetraploid  with an estimated haploid genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . this polyploid genome configuration reduces the efficiency of potato breeding and makes potato genetics complicated  <cit> . to circumvent these drawbacks, diploid potato clones  are often made, which can serve as intermediate steps in a breeding program  <cit>  or can be used as parents for genetic crosses and for mapping of agriculturally important traits  <cit> . however, despite the availability of diploids, the development of physical map resources in potato has until now been very limited. local bac maps have been produced for disease resistance gene regions in two diploids and a wild hexaploid species  <cit> . in order to develop a lasting resource for gene identification and map based cloning in potato, we set out to create a genome-wide bac-based physical map. this physical map is made from the diploid clone rh89-039- <dig> , which is the male parent of the ultradense genetic map of potato  <cit> . first, an aflp-based physical map was constructed, and more recently a sequence-tag-based physical map was added, so as to take advantage of the developments in next-generation sequencing. by their method of construction, both potato physical maps differ from previous de novo physical maps of plant genomes.

genome-wide physical maps are made by ordering the clones of a genomic bac library into groups of overlapping bacs called contigs. to this end, a characteristic dna band pattern, called a fingerprint, is made from the individual bacs clones, after which they can be ordered into contigs on the basis of similarity in their fingerprint patterns by specialized software like fpc  <cit> . the published physical maps of plant genomes have shown an evolution of bac fingerprinting methods over the past decade: starting with agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> , this was followed by high-resolution sequencing gels  <cit> , which was in turn superseded by multi-colour capillary electrophoresis  <cit> . all of these fingerprint procedures have relied on restriction enzyme digestion of the bac dna. by contrast, the use of aflp-based bac fingerprinting is rare, and has so far only been reported for a full genome physical map of a nematode  <cit>  and for a local physical map in potato  <cit> . the anchoring of physical maps to genetic maps is most often done with rflp, snp, ssr or est markers  <cit> . bac anchoring by aflp markers  <cit>  is much less common, but was applied on a scale of respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers for the sorghum and grape physical maps  <cit> . the principle of integrating aflp marker anchoring with bac aflp fingerprinting for local physical map construction was reported under the name "keymaps"  <cit> , but has so far not been applied to a genome-wide physical map.

a recent addition to the spectrum of aflp applications  <cit>  is the creation of sequence-based physical maps by a whole genome profiling  strategy  <cit> . wgp exploits the ability of aflp to specifically amplify bac dna fragments that have been cut at the ecori restriction sites, and by high throughput sequencing collects short sequence reads from these ecori sites. because of their fixed and space-separated positions in the genome sequence, these sequence tags are suitable for physical map construction and at the same time provide a scaffold for anchoring whole genome sequence data. thus, wgp marks a new development in physical map construction that is in line with the current developments in dna sequencing technology  <cit> .

for the first potato physical map, it was imperative that it would become integrated with the ultradense aflp marker genetic map of genotype rh  <cit> . therefore, it was decided to fingerprint the bac clones by non-selective aflp with the enzyme combination ecori/msei, and to apply the keymaps procedure  <cit>  for anchoring the bac contigs to the ecori/msei aflp markers of the genetic map. as an improvement of the keymaps anchoring method, we have used a more efficient set of bac dna superpools for genetic marker screening of the bac library. these superpools followed a random k-sets pooling design  <cit>  that allowed genetic marker localisation within quarter library plate segments, which is four times more accurate than the direct full library plate pool screening used in the original keymaps protocol.

to improve the quality of the aflp physical map, and to expedite the sequencing of the rh genome by next generation technology, a second sequence-tag-based physical map was constructed with whole genome profiling of bac clones  <cit> . this wgp physical map includes clones from both the restriction enzyme-based bac library of the aflp physical map and a second bac library, which was prepared by random shearing of genomic dna  <cit> . this sheared library was anticipated to close remaining gaps in the physical map.

the aflp physical map has already been in use for sequencing parts of the rh genome  <cit>  and for constructing cytogenetic maps  <cit> . preliminary results have been published in an overview paper  <cit> , as part of a local sequence map  <cit>  and in a phd thesis  <cit> . presented here are the full methods of construction and characteristics of both the aflp physical map and the new wgp physical map and their mutual integration. the relevance of these physical maps to potato genomics research is discussed.

RESULTS
aflp fingerprinting and aflp physical map construction
the aflp fingerprinting has been described in detail by borm  <cit> , and the main results are summarized here. the rhpotkey bac library comprises  <dig>   <dig> clones that were obtained from partial digestion of genomic dna from diploid potato clone rh. all bac clones were fingerprinted with the non-selective aflp pcr reaction, using the enzyme combination ecori/msei. the aflp samples were separated by high throughput capillary electrophoresis in the mobility range 60- <dig> bp, and aflp bands were scored from the trace files by band calling software . the number of aflp bands per bac followed a bell-shaped distribution, with a peak at  <dig> bands per bac. the band density of the aflp fingerprints was skewed towards the low mobility end of the gels and could be fitted to a truncated geometric distribution. this skewed size distribution has an adverse effect on physical map construction, because it will increase the likelihood of overlaps between unrelated aflp fragments  <cit> .

the final aflp fingerprint dataset for physical map construction was produced after a number of processing and cleaning steps, involving preliminary versions of the physical map. removed were chloroplast traces , artefact band containing traces , and mixed fingerprints from well-to-well contaminations . a band size window of 100- <dig> bp was chosen for fingerprint alignment, and bacs were selected for having between  <dig> and  <dig> bands in this interval. below  <dig> bp the band density became very high, because of the skewed length distribution of the aflp fragments. above  <dig> bp, many fingerprints were contaminated by size ladder bands due to incomplete separation of the signals from the different fluorescence channels. by applying these two band size cut-offs, the possibilities for false fingerprint alignments are reduced. the result of these filtering operations was a set of  <dig> fingerprints with a peak at  <dig> bands per bac .

the selection of  <dig> aflp fingerprints, representing  <dig>  g.e. of genomic dna, was aligned into a physical map with the computer program finger printed contigs   <cit> . the bac contigs were built with a slightly relaxed alignment cut-off value of 1e- <dig>  which maximised the number of incorporated bacs, but also resulted in a high initial number  of questionable fingerprints, with friction alignment. these questionable bac alignments then were removed for  <dig>  percent by re-alignments of the affected contigs with the dqer function at more stringent cut-off values of up to 1e- <dig>  next, two rounds of automated end-to-end merging were performed on the bac contigs at more relaxed cut-off values of 1e- <dig> and then 1e- <dig>  the resulting aflp physical map has  <dig> bac contigs containing  <dig> clones, with an estimated total contig length of  <dig> mb .

aflp marker screening of the bac library
for aflp marker screening of the rhpotkey bac library, a set of  <dig> dna superpools was prepared from  <dig> quarter library plate pool  dna samples, using a random k-sets pooling design  <cit> . with this pooling design, superpool marker scores are deconvoluted to produce a list of qpps that contain all the copies of the marker that are present in the superpool set. in this way, marker copies are located in the bac library within an accuracy of a quarter library plate segment, and this partial marker localization is used as the input information for the in silico bac contig anchoring procedure described in the next paragraph. the characteristics of the bac pooling design are described in detail in the methods section.

we have tested  <dig> selective ecori/msei aflp primer combinations with  <dig> aflp markers from the rh genetic map  <cit>  on the  <dig> bac superpools. these aflp gels were made by capillary electrophoresis, so that for the anchoring procedure the aflp marker bands could be directly compared with the aflp bands in the bac capillary fingerprints. figure  <dig> illustrates the steps of the marker screening procedure.

because the aflp markers of the rh genetic map were identified in radioactive gels, it was not possible to locate them directly in the capillary bac pool gels, since significant shifts in aflp band mobilities occur between both electrophoresis systems. therefore, additional radioactive aflp gels were made of the first  <dig> bac superpools and of the parental genotypes of the genetic map. these marker size conversion gels  formed a bridge between the original radioactive gels of the genetic map  and the capillary bac pool gels , and enabled a reliable marker size conversion between both systems.

for aflp markers with radioactive sizes below  <dig> bp, it was found that the shift in band mobilities in the capillary gels varied from  <dig> bp smaller to  <dig> bp larger . above  <dig> bp, the capillary sizes were increasingly larger than the radioactive sizes, with up to a + <dig> bp difference for markers near the maximum  of the radioactive size range. the success rate with which the radioactive aflp markers could be identified in the capillary bac pool gels was 71%.

aflp marker anchoring of bacs
the aflp marker scores in the bac superpools were deconvoluted to produce a list of candidate qpps that may contain the marker . for markers that had produced an output of at least two qpps, this list of qpps was compared in silico against the bac contigs of the aflp physical map. the physical map location of a marker was determined following the keymaps principle, by searching for the bac contig that had two  overlapping bacs that matched the positive qpps, and that had an aflp band in their non-selective ecori/msei fingerprint with the same mobility as the aflp marker . markers with only a single positive qpp could in nearly all cases not be reliably placed on bacs with the in silico search, and were omitted from analysis.

in total  <dig> aflp markers produced an anchor with the in silico mapping, placing  <dig> contigs containing  <dig> bacs on the genetic map . the distribution of these  <dig> anchored bacs across the rh genetic map is shown in figure  <dig>  because of local suppression of recombination, the aflp markers occur in high densities in the centromeric bins of the genetic map, and consequently this is where a large proportion of the anchored contigs are located. physically, these centromeric bins span a large distance on the cytogenetic map  <cit> , and therefore the genetic distances shown in figure  <dig> must be interpreted with caution, because they can give a locally distorted view of distances in the physical map. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> innately have relatively few markers in the rh genetic map  <cit> , which is reflected in their low anchoring results. although the anchored bacs are fairly well distributed on most chromosome maps, genetic regions still exist where anchoring is sparse. for instance, the bin 52- <dig> region on chromosome  <dig> is devoid of markers, but was shown to span a significant cytogenetic distance with an estimated length of  <dig>  mb  <cit> . also on chromosome  <dig>  aflp anchoring is sparse in the euchromatic regions of the chromosome arms, especially in the bin 52- <dig> region, which was recently added to the rh <dig> map on the basis of fish analysis  <cit> . from bac end sequences, one contig of  <dig> bacs was identified as having 18s and 26s ribosomal dna sequences. fish confirmed that this contig represents the nucleolar organizer region , which is located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> in solanum species  <cit> .

the validity of the in silico-generated aflp anchors has been verified by different approaches, such as wet lab testing  <cit>  and in situ hybridisation  <cit> . also, the occurrence of double or triple anchors within contigs of the aflp physical map  has been used to search for invalid anchors. based on these verifications,  <dig> in silico aflp anchors were found to be incorrect, which corresponds to an error rate of  <dig>  percent across the entire anchoring procedure. the success rate of the in silico anchoring step was 76%. when also taking into account the efficiency of the marker size conversion, the overall success rate of bac anchoring with the  <dig> ecori/msei aflp markers from parent rh was 54%.

the aflp anchor set of the physical map was extended with  <dig> aflp markers that were identified via other routes. four psti/msei markers were identified in bacs by screening a third bac library of genotype rh. the fingerprints of these positive clones were included in the rh physical map and anchored a large contig to bin  <dig> of the chromosome  <dig> genetic map. local physical map construction in the h <dig> nematode resistance gene region identified one psti/msei and two saci/msei markers in the bac sequences, and anchored contigs to the bin  <dig> region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . these additionally anchored contigs are included in figure  <dig>  more aflp markers were identified from sequenced bac clones in the euchromatic regions of chromosome  <dig>  but in most cases these overlapped with the in silico aflp anchors. the aflp physical map has a total of  <dig> bacs in which one or more aflp markers were identified, and the bac contigs that are genetically anchored by these seed bacs represent  <dig> mb of sequence .

marker copy number and performance of bac superpools
the distribution of the number of bacs identified per marker is shown in figure 6b. single copy markers do not contribute to the frequency distribution since they were largely omitted from anchoring. most aflp markers had  <dig> or  <dig> bacs identified from the bac superpools. the total amount of bac dna represented in the superpools is estimated to be  <dig> genome equivalents. since all aflp markers are, by definition, heterozygously present in the genome, their expected copy number in the bac pools is  <dig>  taking into account that slight losses in marker identification will have occurred in the anchoring procedure, our observed average marker count corresponds very well with the expected value for heterozygous markers.

the compact set of  <dig> bac superpools, containing  <dig> clones, was specifically designed to provide an efficient screening procedure for the heterozygous, and therefore low copy number, aflp markers in the relatively large  <dig> mb potato genome. this screening efficiency was in part achieved by performing the marker localisation only down to the quarter plate pool level. other marker screening strategies in plant bac libraries typically have used more than twice the number of bac pools, while being applied to less clones. for example, in the  <dig> mb sorghum genome, a set of  <dig> six-dimensional bac library pools containing  <dig> clones has been used to locate homozygous aflp markers on individual bac clones  <cit> . the same bac pooling design has been used for marker screening in  <dig> g.e. of the heterozygous  <dig> mb grape genome  <cit>  and with an extension to  <dig> pools containing  <dig> bacs for screening of  <dig> . g.e. of the  <dig> mb soybean genome  <cit> . a drawback of our bac anchoring procedure, as compared to these other pooling methods, is that single copy aflp markers cannot be placed on the bac clones, unless additional wet lab tests are performed.

whole genome profiling physical map
whole genome profiling sequence tags were obtained for  <dig> clones of the rhpotkey bac library and for  <dig> clones of the rhpotluc bac library by high throughput end sequencing of ecori/msei restriction fragments  <cit> . in total  <dig> sequence tags of  <dig> bp were assigned to the bac clones . these tags represent  <dig> unique sequences, which corresponds to an average distance between tags of  <dig> bp on a haploid potato genome length of  <dig> mb. the distribution of the number of tags per bac is shown separately for the two libraries in figure  <dig>  the rhpotkey clones have on average of  <dig> tags per bac, whereas the shorter rhpotluc clones have on average  <dig> tags per bac. remarkable was that the plates of the sheared rhpotluc library systematically had a 20% lower yield of bacs with wgp tags compared to the rhpotkey library. this difference most likely is caused by a higher fraction of repeat-rich clones in the sheared library  <cit> , since such clones will fail to resolve their tag sequences with the current wgp sequencing protocol  <cit> .

** this count excludes  <dig>  failed rhpotkey library plates

the wgp fingerprints were prepared for physical map construction with fpc by replacing the tag sequences by randomly chosen id numbers, that serve as pseudo band mobility values for fingerprint alignment . chimeric wgp fingerprints were removed from the dataset and the remaining  <dig> bacs, representing  <dig>  g.e. of dna, were aligned into a physical map. the map was built with a relatively relaxed alignment cut-off value of 1e- <dig>  contigs with more than  <dig> questionable clones were split up and re-aligned with the dq-er function in three steps of increasing stringency . finally two rounds of automated end-end merging were performed between the contigs at thresholds of 1e- <dig>  and then 1e- <dig> 

the resulting wgp physical map has a length of  <dig> mb, with  <dig> contigs containing  <dig> clones and  <dig> single bacs . the wgp map shares  <dig> rhpotkey clones with the aflp physical map. as a result, nearly all aflp marker anchor points could be carried over to the wgp map, and  <dig> contigs were anchored. the bac alignments in the physical map contigs result in a partial ordering of the wgp tags, which generates contig-wide sequence scaffolds that can be used for anchoring of wgs sequences .

it was anticipated that the use of the sheared rhpotluc library in the wgp map would close gaps between bac contigs that cannot be bridged by the partial digest clones of the rhpotkey library. however, in the contigs of wgp physical map , very little evidence was found of gap closure by the sheared bacs. it is therefore concluded that the wgp physical map did not benefit from the incorporation of the sheared library clones. a possible explanation for this failure is that the gap-filling clones of the sheared library contain very repetitive sequences, and could therefore not be fingerprinted with the current wgp protocol. possibly, the 20% lower yield of clones with wgp tags in the rhpotluc library is correlated with the failure to find gap-filling clones.

integration of aflp and wgp physical maps into hybrid map
the  <dig> clones that are shared by the aflp and wgp physical maps were used to identify contig overlaps between both maps. a search was made for contig pairs from the aflp and wgp map that had at least two bac clones in common. the aflp and wgp contigs that were connected via such a bac link, or via a chain of such bac links, were placed in contig groups. a total of  <dig> contig groups were identified that contained one pair of contigs from both maps. in addition,  <dig> groups were identified that joined three or more contigs from both maps. within each physical map, the number of contigs was recounted, with each contig group now being taken as a single contig. this group enhancement brought the number of contigs in the aflp map down by 32% to  <dig> and in the wgp map down by 22% to  <dig> . additional file  <dig> shows an example of contig grouping between both maps. the contig descriptions of both physical maps, with their contig grouping information, have been combined in a single table that describes the hybrid potato physical map .

comparison of aflp and wgp physical maps
the map integration via contig groups showed that nearly all larger contigs were mirrored in both maps. the only notable difference was that the aflp map contained a 96-clone contig from the nor , and two other contigs of  <dig> and  <dig> clones with uniform, simple fingerprints, that were not seen in the wgp physical map. this difference most likely is caused by a high content of repetitive sequences in these bacs, since such sequence tags will fail to resolve with the wgp sequencing protocol. similarly, the chloroplast fingerprints of the aflp map were absent in the wgp map, because their presence in 14- <dig> clones per library plate will prevent deconvolution of their wgp sequence tags.

the contig build in the wgp map was of a better quality than that of the aflp map . using less fingerprints , the number of contigs was smaller  and yet the genome coverage by the total contig length was slightly better than the aflp map . this difference in quality is also reflected in both the average and n <dig> contig sizes .

in terms of map construction, the wgp physical map had more difficulty than the aflp map with removing friction in the bac alignments, which is reflected in the higher number of contigs with five or more questionable clones . chimeric fingerprints gave more severe disturbances of the bac alignments in the wgp map, as compared to the aflp map, and it was necessary to remove them as much as possible. well-to-well fingerprint contaminations, on the other hand, were present in the aflp contigs, but absent in the wgp contigs.

the wgp physical map has a much higher proportion  of singleton clones than the aflp map  . one explanation for this difference is that the aflp physical map did not include clones with less than  <dig> bands, which may have kept its singleton count low. however, a better explanation is found in the different shapes of the fingerprint band distributions of both maps . in the wgp map, the distribution of the number of tags per bac is asymmetric compared to the fingerprint band distribution of the aflp map. the wgp tag distribution maintains a very wide tail for bacs that have less than  <dig> tags. a likely explanation for this overrepresentation of wgp fingerprints in the low end of the distribution is that they belong to clones of normal length that are missing relatively many of their sequence tags, because these are repetitive sequence tags, which are not resolved by the wgp sequencing  <cit> . such sparsely tagged bacs are more likely to remain singleton clones in the physical map, which fits the sharp rise in singleton clones towards the low end of the distribution.

heterozygosity analysis
the aflp markers of the potato physical map are heterozygous markers that specifically identify bac clones that belong to either the phase {0} haplotype or the phase {1} haplotype of their chromosome . although an aflp marker locus can have two allelic bands of the opposite haplotype, such allele pairs are not revealed in the potato genetic map, and the aflp markers are treated as presence/absence  markers with only a single allele. this means that the potato aflp markers cannot be used for the evaluation of physical map heterozygosity through direct identification of allelic bac clones, as was done with codominant snp markers in the grape physical map  <cit> .

nevertheless, indirect evidence that genome heterozygosity has resulted in haplotype-specific bac fingerprint alignments in both physical maps can be derived from the distribution of the aflp marker haplotypes in the bac contigs . for the  <dig> bac contigs with two or more aflp markers in the aflp physical map, it was examined what their haplotype composition is. when multiple aflp markers are present in the contigs, there is a strong preference for the markers to stay within one haplotype, and the observed percentages of two-haplotype contigs systematically were much lower than what would be expected on the basis of an independent combination of marker haplotypes . the ultradense genetic map of clone rh  <cit>  shows that markers of both haplotypes occur mixed throughout the genome, and that there is little or no haplotype preference in different genetic regions. therefore, the clear avoidance of aflp marker haplotype mixing in the anchored physical map contigs suggests that their bac clones are to a large degree haplotype specific. those contigs that do combine aflp markers of two haplotypes are on average longer than the single haplotype contigs with the same number of markers . this increased length suggests that incorporation of fingerprints of a second haplotype in a contig does not lead to their full integration, but will instead keep them as a haplotype-specific segment within the contig. similar results were found when analysing the marker haplotype distribution in the  <dig> multi-anchor contigs of the wgp physical map . the only notable difference compared to the aflp physical map was that mixed-haplotype contigs were slightly more abundant among the 2-marker contigs  and among the 3-marker contigs .

**** expected value when aflp marker haplotypes combine independently in the bac contigs

the heterozyogous nature of the rh genome is also revealed by the frequency distribution of the wgp sequence tags . this distribution has a maximum at  <dig> bacs per tag, which is much less than would be expected from the estimated  <dig> genome equivalents of bac dna that produced the tags . the shape of the observed distribution can be explained as being composed of two separate frequency distributions for respectively heterozygous and homozygous sequence tags. a good approximation of the observed distribution is given by the theoretical distribution for  <dig>  genome equivalents of template dna, in which the ratio of heterozygous to homozygous tags is set to be  <dig>  to  <dig> . this interpretation of the frequency distribution would mean that roughly 54% of the wgp tags are heterozygous. such a high level of heterozygosity will be reflected in the alignment of the bac wgp fingerprints, and is likely to have favoured the formation of haplotype-specific contigs in the wgp physical map.

map inflation
both the aflp and wgp physical map presented a total contig length of approximately  <dig> mb . this physical map length is  <dig>  times larger than the  <dig> mb size of the haploid potato genome. such a high level of map inflation was also found for two physical maps of grape  <cit> , where it was attributed largely to the heterozygous nature of the grape genome. heterozygosity-induced assembly of haplotype-specific bac contigs causes genomic regions to occur twice in a diploid physical map, resulting in an increase of the total map length. both the aflp marker haplotype distribution in the potato physical map and the wgp sequence tag copy number distribution have provided indirect evidence of heterozygosity among the potato bac fingerprints, and these observations provide an explanation the large length inflation of the two potato physical maps.

the potato physical maps were constructed by automated calculations with the fpc software, without further manual merging of contigs. even though the final contig merges were carried through at relaxed alignment settings, it is likely that undetected contig overlaps still exist in both potato physical maps. such undetected contig overlaps contributed, for instance, to the  <dig>  fold length inflation of the soybean physical map  <cit> , and will therefore in part also explain the inflation of our potato physical maps.

CONCLUSIONS
presented here are the first two genome-wide bac physical maps of potato, which come from the heterozygous diploid genotype rh89-039- <dig>  these maps serve as an important resource and reference framework for current and future potato research. in this paper we have reported the strategies by which these maps have been made, as well as detailed statistics about them. we have also compared our methods with other recently constructed physical maps.

the aflp physical map is genetically linked to the ultradense genetic map of genotype rh  <cit> . a distinctive feature of this genetic map, as opposed to e.g. est-based genetic maps, is that it has a large proportion of its markers in the pericentromeric, low recombination regions of the chromosomes. this means that the potato physical map is unique in providing an extensive genetic handle on the bac sequences from these heterochromatic regions.

the combined potato physical maps provide a high resolution genome-wide scaffold structure composed of wgp sequence tags and bac end sequences  <cit> , which can be used for anchoring and ordering of whole genome and bac pool derived shotgun sequence assemblies. with 10% of the heterozygous rh genome having been sequenced on a traditional bac by bac basis  <cit> , the sequence scaffolds of the physical map can facilitate the sequencing of the remainder of the rh genome by more high throughput methods.

the physical maps as they are presented here were optimized for having a low number of contigs, and these contigs illustrate the level of fingerprint connectivity that is available in the physical maps between the bacs of a given genomic region. however, this optimization is likely to have caused local misalignments of bacs in contigs with mixed haplotypes. for a proper assessment of bac order and for an evaluation of the effect of heterozygosity on bac fingerprint alignments it will be necessary to compare the physical map contigs with potato sequence data.

of particular interest is the recent finishing of the genome sequence of a doubled monoploid potato  of the solanum tuberosum group phureja by a wgs approach  <cit> . the rh physical map can be aligned to this homozygous potato sequence via the sequences of the wgp tags and of the bac ends. the integration of these two genomics resources will set a new baseline for molecular research in potato that will enable cross-genome gene comparisons between the three haplotypes in genotypes rh and dm. also, the combined framework will serve as a reference onto which sequences from other potato genotypes, including tetraploids, can be placed. these new possibilities will advance functional genomics studies in potato and also stimulate the breeding of potato varieties with novel or improved quality and agronomic traits.
