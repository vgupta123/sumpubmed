BACKGROUND
toll-like receptors  play a central role in innate immunity  <cit> . tlrs are type i integral membrane glycoproteins consisting of leucine rich repeat  motif in the ectodomain , and cytoplamic signaling domains known as toll il-receptor  domains, joined by a single trans membrane helix . they recognize and respond to a variety of components derived from pathogenic or commensal microorganisms principally bacteria and viruses. these molecules include lipids such as lipopolysaccharide  from gram-negative bacteria and peptidoglycan fragments from bacterial cell walls, proteins such as flagellin and nucleic acids such as single-stranded and double-stranded rna and unmethylated cpg dna from bacteria or viruses. the ecds including lrrs have been inferred to recognize directly various ligands. the tlr family counts  <dig> members in human and  <dig> in mice and takifugu rubripes. six major families of vertebrate tlrs have been proposed in a molecular dendrogram  <cit> .

leucine-rich repeat -containing domains are present in over  <dig> proteins listed in pfam, prints, smart, and interpro data bases  <cit> . all lrr repeats can be divided into a highly conserved segment  and a variable segment . the hcs part consists of an eleven residue stretch, lxxlxlxxnxl, or a tweleve residue stretch, lxxlxlxxcxxl, in which "l" is leu, ile, val, or phe, "n" is asn, thr, ser, or cys, and "c" is cys, ser or asn  <cit> . seven classes of lrrs have been proposed, characterized by different lengths and consensus sequences of the vs part of repeats  <cit> . they are "ri-like", "cc", "bacterial", "sds22-like", "plant specific", "typical", and "tplrr". each subfamily of small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan  has lrrs from more than one of the seven classes  <cit> . the structures of twenty-two different proteins that contain lrrs are available  <cit> . they include tlr <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> . the lrr domains in all known structures adopt an arc shape. most of the known lrr structures have a cap, which shields the hydrophobic core of the first lrr at the n-terminus or the last lrr at the c-terminus. in extracellular proteins or extracellular domains, these caps frequently consist of cysteine clusters including two or four cysteine residues  <cit> .

the indicated repeat number of lrrs and its "phasing"  in individual tlrs are different among the databases  and species. this difference reflects the irregularity of lrr motifs in tlrs. over one hundred complete tlrs are available. several methods of protein secondary structure predictions such as proteus and sspro <dig>  show a correspondence of about 75%  <cit> . for the identification of lrrs we propose a new method, which uses the known structures of several lrrs, multiple sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions of tlrs. this new method indicates that each of the six recognized tlr families can be characterized by its lrr motifs, their repeat number and the motifs of two cysteine clusters flanking the lrrs. the actual repeat number of lrrs is generally larger than those reported in the databases. the present analysis leads to the hypothesis that all the lrrs in tlrs form one or two horseshoe domains.

RESULTS
a new method for the identification of lrrs within tlrs
lrr known structures
all of the lrr domains in one protein form a single continuous structure and adopt an arc or horseshoe shape. on the inner, concave face there is a stack of parallel β-strands and on the outer, convex face there are a variety of secondary structures such as α-helix, 310-helix, polyproline ii helix, or a tandem arrangement of β-turns  <cit> . the hcs part of all the lrrs consists of lxxlxlxxnxl or lxxlxlxxcxxl,, as noted, in which "l" is leu, ile, val, or phe, "n" is asn, thr, ser, or cys, and "c" is cys, ser or asn  <cit> . the short β-strands are mostly formed by three residues at positions  <dig> through  <dig> in the hcs part. in most lrr proteins the β-strands on the concave face and  helical elements on the convex face are connected by short loops or β-turns. four leucine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> participate in the hydrophobic core in lrr arcs. similarly, conserved hydrophobic residues in the vs parts of the seven lrr classes participate in the hydrophobic core. the side chains of asparagine at position  <dig> form hydrogen bonds in the loop structure  <cit> .

structural alignments of the known lrr structures reveal that the lrr motif is surprisingly variable . the lengths of lrrs range from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. leucines at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the hcs part are sometimes replaced by met, ala, or cys, as seen in tlr <dig>  <cit> , internalin a   <cit> , and internalin b   <cit> . leucines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are also occupied by relatively hydrophilic residues such as gly, thr, asn and tyr. furthermore, asparagine at position  <dig> is occupied by hydrophobic residues such as val, leu and ile. it is clear that many lrrs do not keep the complete hcs pattern and are irregular. eighteen of the  <dig> known structures contain irregular lrrs. most of the irregular hcss can be classified into four groups; lxxlxlxxxl, lxxlxlxxxl, lxxlxlxxxx, and lxxlxlxxxxx in which residues in boldface are irregular. also there are rare examples, xvxxlxlxxnxl and pxxlxlxxnxl in follicle-stimulating hormone receptor , and lxxlxgxxs/pxi in inl-c and dlc <dig> . furthermore, an irregular lrr with xxxcxxxlxxvpxxipxx, which belongs to the "bacterial" motif, is frequently observed at the first lrr  at the n-terminus of the lrr domain .

multiple sequence alignment
mammalian tlr <dig> contains  <dig> lrrs, as described later. the pfam program detects only 5– <dig> of the  <dig> lrrs, while the interpro database  counts  <dig> in chicken,  <dig> in human, cynomolgus monkey, dog and chinese hamster, and  <dig> in bovine . figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the multiple sequence alignment of the lrr domain in mammalian tlr <dig> from  <dig> species. the sixth lrr  shows canonical and irregular lrrs whose hcs parts consist of lxxlxixxxl and lxxlxixxxl or lxxlxixxlxl, respectively. the vs part is "typical". both canonical and irregular lrr are also seen in lrr <dig> and lrr <dig>  furthermore, the hcs part of lrr <dig> shows lxxlxlxxnxy in which position  <dig> is tyrosine. this pattern was recognized in the known structures of tlr <dig> and lingo- <dig> . the pairwise sequence identities are >35%. thus, all lrrs in tlr2s from the  <dig> species can be reasonably regarded as an lrr motif.

protein secondary structure prediction
the result of the protein secondary structure prediction of human tlr <dig> having  <dig> lrrs is shown in figure  <dig>  both sspro <dig>  and proteus predict that  <dig> of the  <dig> lrrs prefer β-strands at positions  <dig> through  <dig> and/or its neighboring positions in the hcs part. they include all five irregular motifs, lrr <dig>  lrr <dig>  lrr <dig>  lrr <dig>  and lrr <dig>  the occurrence of β-strands in lrr <dig> is predicted only by proteus. however, lrr <dig> with the hcs part of leeleidasdl is clearly a canonical lrr. all twenty including lrr <dig> can be reasonably identified as lrr motifs.

the identification of lrrs within tlrs
these analyses of the known lrr structures, the multiple sequence alignments and the secondary structure predictions of tlr <dig> provide strong evidence that allow us to identify lrrs over an extended range of sequences and inferred structures. taken together four steps for the identification of lrrs in each member of tlrs were used.

step  <dig>  detection of lrrs by the pfam program

step  <dig>  identification of a candidate lrr that can not be recognized by pfam.

step 3: evaluation of protein secondary structure predictions by proteus and sspro <dig> .

step  <dig>  determination of all lrrs in each member based on the results obtained by steps 1– <dig> 

in step  <dig>  the lrr candidates are selected using the criterion that they are longer than  <dig> residues and that the hcs part consisting of lxxlxlxxnxl occupies at least hydrophobic residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  the candidate includes irregular motifs that are similar to lrrs recognized by the known structures. in case there are tlrs from many species, multiple sequence alignments are also considered for identification. in step  <dig>  the preference of β-strand in the hcs part of the lrr candidate selected by step  <dig> and step  <dig> was investigated. in step  <dig>  when the candidate prefers β-strand by either proteus or sspro <dig>  , it is identified as an lrr. in some cases such as lrr <dig> in tlr <dig>  the initial lrr candidate was changed into another lrr based on the results of the secondary structure prediction. the crystal structure of human tlr <dig>  <cit>  contains  <dig> lrrs. the present method confirmed this. in contrast, the pfam and smart programs predicted only 16– <dig> lrrs and the databases have reported  <dig> lrrs .

there are two exceptions. in five mammalian tlr6s with  <dig> lrrs, lrr <dig>  ptllntlh, that contains pro at position  <dig> is not predicted to have a β-strand by both prediction methods . however, this pattern is seen in fshr . similarly, in human and pig tlr <dig> with  <dig> lrrs lrr <dig>  ggkyldhnsf, is not predicted to have a β-strand by both programs . however, this pattern shows remarkable similarity with the sixteenth lrr  in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> with  <dig> lrrs.

lrrs within tlrs
lrr motifs
the repeat number and "phasing" of lrrs in tlrs are summarized in table  <dig> and figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the number of lrrs identified within tlrs range from  <dig> to 28; these numbers are larger than those reported in most databases. the "typical"; "t", lrr, lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxxxxfxxlxx, occurs most frequently followed by shorter motifs including lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxlpxx  with 19– <dig> residues. moreover, all of the c-terminal lrr consists of lxxlxlxxnpxcxcxxxxxxxx. the tlrs contain a variety of irregular lrrs . the first lrr at the n-terminus  is frequently irregular, e.g. xxxcxxxlxxvpxxipxx. this motif has been seen in the structures of tlr <dig>  slit, decorin, and biglycan, as noted. . methionine and tryptophan sometimes occupy positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the lxxlxlxxnxl motif, which are strongly hydrophobic. moreover, as recognized in the known lrr structures, there are rare examples, xvxxlxlxxnxl, pxxlxlxxnxl and lxxlxgxxs/pxi. the first motif is sometimes observed in lrr <dig> in human tlr <dig>  lrr <dig> in takifugu rubripes tlr <dig>  lrr <dig> in chicken tlr <dig>  lrr <dig> in human tlr <dig>  and lrr <dig> in human tlr <dig> . furthermore, the hcs parts of a twelve residue stretch, lxxlxxxxx, are sometimes observed; they include lrr <dig> in tlr <dig> from pig, bovine, nilgai, and domestic water buffalo with  <dig> lrrs , lrr <dig> in mouse tlr <dig> with  <dig> lrrs, and lrr <dig> in tlr <dig> from pig, bovine, rabbit, and nilgai with  <dig> lrrs.

lrrs in the six major families of tlrs
there are six major families of vertebarate tlrs  <cit> . the tlr <dig> family consists of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  this family contains 19– <dig> lrrs and has fewer numbers than do the other families except for dog tlr <dig>   <cit>  and human tlr <dig> variant  in the tlr <dig> family. mammalian tlr <dig> contains  <dig> lrrs . in contrast, takifugu rubripes tlr <dig>  <cit>  has one additional lrr at the n-terminus whose sequence is rnyidlssrnlssvpgdlpke, that is a "bacterial" type. mammalian and takifugu rubripes tlr <dig> contains  <dig> lrrs. japanese flounder tlr <dig> lacks one lrr that corresponds to lrr <dig> in the  <dig> lrrs  <cit> . conversely, zebrafish tlr <dig> has one additional lrr at the n-terminus, as does takifugu rubripes tlr <dig>  this tlr <dig> family shows a feature that irregular lrrs mainly concentrate at the central part of the lrr domain. in the tlr <dig> family, mammalian, takifugu rubripes and zebrafish tlr <dig> contain  <dig> lrrs as was confirmed by the crystal structure of human tlr <dig>  <cit> . however, japanese flounder tlr <dig>  <cit>  contains two additional lrrs. similarity sequence search indicates that tlrs from rainbow trout, atlantic salmon, and goldfish are very similar to japanese flounder tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> that constitute the tlr <dig> family contains  <dig> lrrs. fourteen of the  <dig> lrrs are similar to "typical". seven lrrs are irregular. as seen in the tlr <dig> family,  <dig> of the  <dig> irregular lrrs are in the central part of the lrr domain. dog tlr <dig>   <cit>  and human tlr <dig> variant  are shorter by about  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus. these two tlrs contain only  <dig> lrrs. it is also predicted that dog tlr <dig> has no transmembrane region . tlr <dig> contains  <dig> lrrs. ten of these  <dig> lrrs are clearly "typical". lrr <dig> in mammalian tlr <dig> is only  <dig> residues ; the homolog in takifugu rubripes and rainbow trout is  <dig> residues long. the tlr <dig> family contains 24– <dig> lrrs. most of lrrs in mouse tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> are "typical". the same feature is observed in takifugu rubripes tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  two japanese lamprey tlrs appear to belong to the tlr <dig> family.

the tlr <dig> family consists of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> and contains  <dig> lrrs. cross dot plots were computed for all of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> from human and mouse, and green puffer tlr. more important the super-motif is about  <dig> residues. superposition of  <dig> /2) cross dot-plots for the seven proteins emphasize the super-repeat of lrrs at the n-terminal part of the lrr domain   <cit> . this super-motif comes from nine lrrs from lrr <dig> to lrr <dig> in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and from eight lrrs from lrr <dig> to lrr <dig> in tlr <dig> . the sequence alignment reveals two types of lrr, s and t. the type s lrr is observed in the first, fourth, and seventh of the  <dig> tandem lrrs. all other lrrs are type t. although the third, the sixth and the seventh lrrs is longer than the second, the fifth and the eighth lrrs, their c-terminal vs parts keep the pattern of lxxxxfxxlxx that is seen in "typical" motif. consequently their lrrs are type t. thus, there are three super-repeats, sttsttstt, in tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  and two and two-third super-repeats, _ttsttstt, in tlr <dig>  green puffer tlr forms two horseshoe domains of lrrs. the first domain is homologous to the tlr <dig> family and thus contains also the super-repeat of sttsttstt . lrr <dig> located at the central part of the  <dig> lrrs consists of long amino acid sequence with  <dig> residues in tlr <dig>   <dig> in tlr <dig>  and  <dig> in tlr <dig>  as seen in tlr <dig>  this long lrr motif is observed in chicken tlr <dig>  in all the case the next lrr, lrr <dig>  is an irregular lrr that is described by xlxlxxnxxxvxxxxfxxlxx is similar to "typical" motif, although position  <dig> in the hcs part is not occupied by leucine.

two cysteine clusters flanking the lrr domain
the lrrs within most of tlrs are flanked by two cysteine clusters, each of which contains two to five cysteine residues . here the cysteine clusters on the n- and c-terminal sides of lrrs are termed lrrnt and lrrct, respectively  <cit> . the n-terminal cluster usually consists of two cysteines, cx5–14c, but sometimes  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> cysteines. with high frequency, as noted, the last cysteine of the clusters occupies a structurally equivalent position to those of leucines in the hcs part of lrr <dig>  the cx8c motif in tlr <dig> and the cx10c motif of tlr <dig> form a disulfide bond  <cit> , as does the cx12c motif in gpibα  <cit> . the cx5–14c motifs presumably form disulfide bonds. the c-terminal clusters, excepting those in three tlrs , contain four cysteines consisting of cxcx22–25cx15–20c. the spacing between the first and the second cysteine that are contained in the last lrr is the same for all the families. the other spacing appears to characterize each family. the cxcx25cx18c motif in tlr <dig> forms two disulfide bonds between the first and the third cysteines, and between the second and the fourth cysteines  <cit> . such pairs of disulfide bonds have been observed for the cxcx20cx21c motif in nogo receptor  <cit>  and the cxcx20cx19c motif in slit  <cit> . the disulfide bond connectivity can be inferred for tlrs. the c-terminal cluster for primate tlr <dig>  is different from that of other mammalian tlr <dig> . only in rainbow trout tlr <dig> and takifugu rubripes tlrs <dig> having no tir domain, does the c-terminal cluster consists of two cysteines. there are no n-terminal cysteine clusters in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and dog tlr <dig>  however, the n-terminal amino acid sequence flanking the lrr domain might form a capping structure.

discussion
lrrs within human tlrs
the present analyses of lrrs within vertebrate tlrs indicate that there are at least two types of lrr motifs; "typical"; "t", lrr, lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxxxxfxxlxx and "bacterial"; "s", lrr, lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxlpxx. vertebrate tlrs contain 16– <dig> lrrs . bell et al.,  <cit>  have proposed that the ecds of human tlrs comprised 19– <dig> lrrs including both "t" and "s" lrrs. each member of human tlrs contain 1– <dig> times less lrrs than those identified here. furthermore, in the tlr <dig> family  the lrrs at the central parts are aligned differently to each other. such a difference is also seen in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  the alignments of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are nearly identical except the first lrr at the n-terminus of the lrr domain and the last lrr at its c-terminus.

one or two horseshoe domains of lrrs within tlrs
the tlr <dig> family  have  <dig> lrrs and an additional 58– <dig> residues at the end of lrr <dig> . such a long region is also observed in chicken tlr <dig> . gibbard et al.,  <cit>  have considered two horseshoe domains of lrrs for human tlr <dig>  that is, lrr <dig> has been separated into an lrr motif and  <dig> residues of undetermined structure. most of the known lrr structures have a cap, which shields the hydrophobic core at the n- and c-terminii of lrrs. we suggest that these  <dig> residues function as the cap of the horseshoe structure, an intervening of hydrophobic core of lrr with a specific feature in tlrs. thus, it can be concluded that the lrrs in vertebrate tlrs form one or two distinct horseshoe structures. future structure determinations should resolve the question.

the tlr <dig> family  and the tlr <dig> family share a common feature, the central part of the lrr domain has a more irregular motif compared with those at the n- and c-terminal parts. the lrr structure in the three families of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> might show a structural flexibility at the central part. alternatively, the central part would play a key role in the function.

the lrr arc of tlrs is flat?
the lrr arc structures can be characterized by three parameters- the inner radius of the arc , the mean rotation angle about the central axis relating one β-strand to the next , and the tilt angle of the parallel β-strand direction per turn . a 3d circle fitting method to calculate these geometrical parameters has been developed  <cit> . the tlr3-lrr arc yields r =  <dig> – <dig> Å, ϕ¯
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaacuahvpgagaqeaaaa@2e90@ =  <dig> – <dig> ° and θt =  <dig> – <dig> °. the tlr3-lrr belongs to "typical" type. this r value is comparable to 22– <dig> Å for the lrr arcs in slit, fshr, nogo receptor, decorin, and gpibα with "typical" lrrs  <cit> . in contrast, the θt value is comparable to only those for slit  and fshr . also the θt value corresponds to 19–40° for ribonuclease inhibitor and 15° for tropomodulin with "ri-like" lrrs. that is, the tlr3-lrr arc is nearly flat. this indicates that all other tlrs except for the tlr <dig> family and tlr <dig> might adopt flat lrr arc.

super-motif of lrrs in the tlr <dig> family
the present analysis reveals that the tlr <dig> family consisting of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> and green puffer tlr contains the super-motif consisting of stt. such super motifs have been observed in various lrr proteins  <cit> . one of them is the slrp family. the slrp family forms five distinct subfamilies. class i consists of biglycan, decorin, and asporin. class ii has three subclasses: lumican plus fibromodulin , prelp plus keratocan , and osteoadherin . class iii consists of epiphycan, osteoglycin and opticin. class iv is more distantly related and consists of chondroadherin and nyctalopin. class v consists of podocan. their classes except for class iv contain the super-motif. super-motifs, s and t, similar to those in slrp are also present in asporin-like proteins from human and mouse, mouse fibromodulin-like proteins, biglycan-like proteins from sea lamprey, oligodendrocyte-myelin and glycoprotein , the flrt family from human, mouse and xenopus, and human ecm <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, a preliminary analysis indicates that nephrocan, a novel member of the slrp family  <cit> , contains an stt motif. these observations suggest strongly that "bacterial" and "typical" lrrs evolved from a common precursor.

lrr variants in tlrs associated with diseases
a number of amino acid polymorphisms, which occur in lrrs, have been reported in tlrs. arbour et al.,  <cit>  first identified two mutations of human tlr <dig>  d299g and t399i, which were associated with diminished airway responsiveness to inhaled lps. since then, these two mutations have been studied for their association with various infectious and inflammatory diseases; results regarding the effects of these mutations have been inconclusive  <cit> . d299g and t399i occur in lrr <dig> and lrr <dig>  respectively . d299g is near the convex part, while t399i is located on the loop c-terminal to the convex part. very recently, ohara et al.,  <cit>  reported that one mutation, t135a, was associated with poorly-differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas. t135a in lrr <dig> occur at position  <dig> in the hcs part . such a mutation has been observed in many lrr proteins such as nyctalopin, keratocan, gpibα, gpibβ and gpix, which are associated with human diseases  <cit> . position  <dig> is generally occupied by asn or cy and sometimes by thr or ser, whose side chains form hydrogen bonds in the loop structure  <cit> . the t135a mutation may disrupt the hydrogen bond pattern in the loop.

mouse tlr <dig> plays a role in defense against systemic mouse cytomegalovirus infection. mice with the mutation, l499p, are highly susceptible to mouse cytomegalovirus infection and shows low levels of cytokine induction and natural killer activation on viral infection  <cit> . l499p is located at the short loop that connects the helical structure on the convex part  and the β-strand on concave part  . that is, l499p in lrr <dig> occur at position  <dig> in the hcs part. the side chain of l <dig> is completely buried in the lrr arc. such a mutation is also observed in trk-a and nyctalopin, which are associated with human diseases  <cit> . the mutation of d543a in human tlr <dig> abolishes the binding of cpg dna  <cit> . d543a in lrr <dig> occur at position  <dig> in the vs part. thus, d543a is located at the edge between the convex and the concave parts of the lrr arc. the cys-to-ala mutations in the vs part of lrr <dig>  completely abolish signaling by tlr <dig>  <cit> .

hidaka et al.,  <cit>  detected one mutation, f <dig>  in human tlr <dig> in one of three patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy. this was a loss-of-function mutation. f303s in lrr <dig> is located at position  <dig> in the hcs part. the side chain of f <dig> is completely buried in the lrr arc. two mutations, h539e and n541a, resulted in the loss of tlr <dig> activation and ligand binding functions  <cit> . these two mutations occur in lrr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the new method of alignment proposed here rationalizes the difference in the repeat numbers of lrrs and their "phasing" within tlrs in different databases and for various species and isoforms. moreover, the new method indicates that each of the six tlr families is characterized by their lrr motifs, their repeat numbers, and the motifs of cysteine clusters. the repeat number of lrrs is larger than those previously reported in databases. the central part in the lrr domains within the tlr <dig> family and tlr <dig> has more irregular motifs compared with the n- and c-terminal parts. moreover, the tlr <dig> family contains a region with 58– <dig> residues in the central part of the lrr domain. the central parts are inferred to play a key role in the structure and/or function of their tlrs. the lrrs in tlrs form one or two horseshoe domains. the lrr arc of tlrs is also predicted to be nearly flat. furthermore, the lrr super-motif in the tlr <dig> family suggests strongly that "bacterial" and "typical" lrrs evolved from a common precursor. the present analysis should stimulate and facilitate various experimental studies to understand the molecular mechanism of tlr-ligand interactions.
