BACKGROUND
the folate receptor , also known as the folic acid  binding protein, is responsible for binding of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate  with high affinities , thereby playing an important role in the uptake of serum folates by cells expressing this receptor
 <cit> . four isoforms of the human fr, fr-α, -β, -γ and –δ, have been identified and characterized. fr-α is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells
 <cit> . fr-β is expressed only on activated macrophages and the surfaces of malignant cells of hematopoietic origin
 <cit> . fr-γ was identified as a secretory protein from hematopoietic tissues, and demonstrated to have a much lower affinity for fa than fr-α
 <cit> . fr-δ has proven difficult to detect in human tissues, suggesting a highly restricted spatial/temporal expression pattern, presence of a pseudogene, or predominance of an alternatively spliced variant
 <cit> . recent data, however, has indicated that fr-δ may be expressed on regulatory t cells 
 <cit> .

analysis of amino acid sequences in the mouse led to the identification of homologues of human fr-α and fr-β, known as folic acid-binding protein  <dig> and  <dig> 
 <cit> . utilizing a ‘genome database mining’ strategy, spiegelstein et al. identified a third murine fr, folbp <dig> , which is highly homologous to human fr-δ
 <cit> . in addition to regulating fa uptake, fr <dig> has been hypothesized to play a potential role in immune responses based upon its expression profile, which includes spleen- and thymus-related lymphoid tissues and lymphocytes
 <cit> . indeed, fr <dig> has been demonstrated to be exclusively expressed in splenic lymphocytes, especially in the t lymphocytes, and in mature thymocytes; however, few studies have reported on the characterization of fr4
 <cit> .

tregs are required for proper maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis
 <cit> . studies to identify molecular markers of tregs determined that fr <dig> is expressed at particularly high amounts in natural tregs and plays an important role in the maintenance of the treg phenotype
 <cit> . in our previous study, we identified a fr <dig> cdna splice variant  with intron  <dig>  retained from the fr <dig> gene and confirmed protein expression of this variant
 <cit> . here, we report the identification of another fr <dig> transcript variant, named fr4d <dig>  with the full-length exon  <dig>  deleted. the fr4d3-encoded protein was confirmed to be expressed on cd4+cd25+ tregs by western blotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting  assays. finally, the role of the fr4d <dig> variant was investigated by overexpression in treg cells in vitro.

methods
isolation of rna, amplification and cloning of fr4d3
six to eight-week-old female balb/c mice were purchased from the animal center at the chinese academy of medical science branch in beijing, china. all animals were maintained in pathogen-free conditions. all of the animal studies were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the third military medical university.

total rna was extracted from balb/c mouse splenocytes using the trizol® reagent  according to the manufacturer's instructions. approximately  <dig> μg of total rna was reverse transcribed to cdna using the high fidelity primescript™ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  kit . the cdna was then used as template to pcr amplify the fr <dig> coding dna sequence  with the following primers corresponding to the ends of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the mouse fr <dig> gene, respectively: mfr4-f, 5'-atggcacagtggtggcagat-3'; mfr4-r, 5'-tcagg gatggaacaacaggc-3'. the pcr reaction was carried out under the following thermal cycling conditions:  <dig> cycles of 98°c for  <dig> s and 68°;c for  <dig> s. the pcr amplicons were then subcloned into the pmd19-t vector , and the clones were fully sequenced at shanghai sangon biological engineering technology & services co., ltd . the mrna expression of fr <dig>  fr4v and fr4d <dig> genes in splenocytes, cd4+ t cells, and cd4+cd25+ t cells were detected using rt-pcr assays with the following primers: 5'-gggacaaactgctcagcgtct-3'  and 5'-agacaccgcccactgttcct-3' .

to construct fr4- or fr4d3-expressing recombinant plasmids, the fr <dig> or fr4d <dig> coding sequence was pcr-amplified from balb/c mouse splenocytes rna and cloned directly into the pci-neo vector . the following primers were used: forward primer: 5'-ccgctcgaggccaccatggcacagtggtggcagat-3'; reverse primer: 5'-cgtgggtgctctagatcagggatggaacaacaggc-3'.

facs analysis
approximately 1 ×  <dig> splenocytes were stained with anti-cd4-fitc, anti-cd25-pe and anti-cd8- percp-cy <dig>  antibodies . the stained cells were separated by facs into batches of cd4+cd25+ t cells, cd4+cd25- t cells, and cd8+ t cells with a facs-aria high-speed cell sorter . the isolated cd4+cd25+ t cells were stained with intracellular anti-foxp3-apc antibody  and then detected by the facs-aria high-speed cell sorter.

western blotting analysis
isolated splenocytes and t cell subsets cd4+cd25–, cd4+cd25+, or cd8+ were lysed with the t-per® tissue protein extraction reagent  at room temperature. after  <dig> min of lysis, the cell debris was removed via centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min at 4°;c and the lysates were treated with n-glycosidase before blotting
 <cit> . the protein-containing supernatant was mixed with 4 × nonreducing lithium dodecyl sulfate  sample buffer  and heated for  <dig> min at 70°;c. the protein samples  were resolved by electrophoresis through nupage® novex 10% bis-tris mini-gels  and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride  membrane . after blocking of non-specific sites, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody  at 4°;c overnight, followed by incubation with secondary antibody  for  <dig> h. immunoreactive bands were observed using the enhanced chemiluminescence  detection reagents , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. β-actin was detected as an internal control .

the pci-neo-fr <dig> or pci-neo-fr4d <dig> vector  was added to 2 ×  <dig> facs-sorted cd4+cd25+ tregs resuspended in  <dig> μl of mouse t cell nucleofector solution and electroporated using the 96-dn- <dig> program on the nucleofector instrument . after  <dig> h of culture in serum-free conditions, the expressions of fr <dig> and fr4d <dig> proteins in the respective transfected cells were analyzed with western blotting assay using anti-mouse fr <dig>  as the primary antibody. the immunoreactive bands were scanned and densitometric analysis was performed by bio-rad quantity one software.

proliferation assays
the facs-sorted cd4+cd25+ tregs were stimulated with various concentrations of fa  in the presence of interleukin - <dig> , anti-cd <dig> /anti-cd <dig>  . cultures were incubated for three days and labeled with  <dig>  μci  thymidine  during the last  <dig> hours of incubation. tdr incorporation was measured by a liquid scintillation counter . all assays were performed in triplicate.

the cd4+cd25+ tregs transfected with pci-neo-fr <dig> or pci-neo-fr4d <dig> plasmids were seeded in 96-well u-bottom plates pre-coated with anti-cd <dig> and co-stimulated for three days with soluble anti-cd <dig> , with or without il- <dig>  or fa . during the last  <dig> hours of culture, cells were labeled with  <dig>  μci  thymidine. thymidine incorporation was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. all assays were performed in triplicate.

statistical analysis
relative comparisons of fr <dig> and fr4d <dig> proteins’ intensity abundance between the transfected cells and untransfected cells detected by western blot assay and the differences in proliferation of sorted cd4+cd25+ tregs were analyzed by means of the 2-tailed student’s t-test. p-values less than  <dig>  were considered significant.

RESULTS
identification of a novel fr <dig> isoform
when we amplified the full-length fr <dig> cds from murine splenocytes by rt-pcr with the primer pair mfr4-f and mfr4-r , three distinctive transcripts were amplified. the sizes of the two largest transcripts corresponded to the full-length fr <dig>  and the variant fr4v 
 <cit> ; however, the third transcript appeared to be a truncated form of fr <dig>  . the  <dig> bp pcr product was isolated, cloned and sequenced. results showed that the  <dig> bp band’s sequence was almost identical to the fr <dig> cds, except with  <dig> bp of contiguous sequence deleted. alignment analysis with fr <dig> mrna sequence revealed that the missing  <dig> bp sequence corresponded to the entire exon  <dig> of the reported fr <dig> mrna . this newly identified splice variant of the fr <dig> gene was designated as fr4d <dig>  furthermore, the results indicated that the mature mrnas of fr4d <dig>  fr4v, and fr <dig> were generated from the same pro-mrna. we then investigated the mrna expression of fr <dig> gene variants in splenocytes, cd4+ t cells, and cd4+cd25+ t cells, respectively. the rt-pcr assays revealed that all fr <dig> variants were expressed in these cell types, but the relative abundance of fr4d <dig> was lower than the other variants .
 <cit> .

since the  <dig> bp-length exon  <dig> is composed of exactly  <dig> triplet codes of the fr <dig> mrna, its elimination will not change the correct translation of fr4d <dig> mrna. therefore, western blotting assay was used to determine whether the fr4d <dig> protein was expressed in mouse spleen cells. as shown in figure
1e, the anti-fr <dig> antibody detected both the full-length fr <dig> and the truncated fr4d <dig> variant in mouse splenocytes, whose predicted molecular masses were approximately  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, respectively. the sequence and theoretical translation of this novel cdna were submitted to genbank and can be found under accession numbers eu <dig>  and aby <dig> , respectively.

predominant expression of fr4d <dig> in cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells
it has been reported that natural treg cells constitutively express higher amounts of fr4
 <cit> . in order to examine whether the fr4d <dig> exhibits a differential distribution in t cell subpopulations, high purity populations of specific t cell subtypes were obtained by facs sorting. the purity of isolated cd8+, cd4+cd25–, and cd4+cd25+ t cells reached  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively . after sorting, we detected the purity of foxp3-positive cells in the isolated cd4+cd25+ t cells and found that the foxp3-positive cells reached ~91%, suggesting that most of the isolated cd4+cd25+ t cells were tregs . western blotting analysis of these subtypes showed that fr <dig> and fr4d <dig> proteins were expressed in cd4+cd25+ tregs at a higher level than in either cd4+cd25- or cd8+ t cells . these results suggested that fr4d <dig> may play a redundant or unique functional role in cd4+cd25+ tregs.

effect of overexpression of fr4d <dig> on proliferation of cd4+cd25+ t cells
the capacity to efficiently bind and incorporate folic acid is linked to cellular proliferation, and indeed overexpression of folate receptors is a characteristic feature of certain tumors
 <cit> . it has been reported that fr <dig> is not merely a marker of natural treg cells but is also functionally essential for their maintenance since blockade of fr <dig> was sufficient to reduce natural treg cells in vivo <cit> . in order to investigate the function of fr <dig> and fr4d <dig>  we respectively overexpressed each in the isolated cd4+cd25+ tregs. results showed that the level of fr <dig> or fr4d <dig> protein was much higher in transfected cells than in untransfected cells . we then examined the proliferative ability of facs-sorted cd4+cd25+ tregs in response to stimulation with fa, in the presence of il- <dig>  anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig>  in vitro. results should that only simultaneous stimulation with anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> in the presence of il- <dig> could abrogate the anergic state of cd4+cd25+ tregs. moreover, the proliferative ability of these cells was further enhanced by addition of fa to the stimulation mixture in a dose-response manner , and fa mediated more proliferation than simply overexpressing the fr4d <dig> gene . however, the proliferation capacity of cells induced with fa + il-2 + anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> was even further enhanced by overexpression of fr <dig> or fr4d <dig> , indicating that both receptors have a substantial capacity to uptake the fa substrate. the wild-type  fr <dig> appeared to have stronger ability to uptake fa than the fr3d <dig> variant since overexpression of the former showed higher proliferative capacity in the presence of the fa substrate .

discussion
in this study, we have identified a novel alternative splicing variant of the fr <dig> gene, named fr4d <dig>  which lacks the entire exon  <dig> of the fr <dig> gene. fr4d <dig> proteins were found to be expressed in cd4+cd25+ tregs at a higher level than in cd4+cd25- or cd8+ t cells. furthermore, overexpression of fr4d <dig> in facs-sorted cd4+cd25+ tregs was found to enhance proliferative capacity of these cells in vitro.

recent studies have demonstrated that nearly every multi-exon gene, including “constitutively” spliced genes
 <cit> , produces alternative mrna isoforms
 <cit> . although many of these isoforms have important functional roles, it is clear that some of these mrnas are produced by errors that occur during the splicing process
 <cit> . in fact, different rna quality controls have evolved to recognize and degrade such errors. for those mrnas that escape detection and destruction, expression may be at such low levels that the new mrna isoforms may be tolerated by the cell, eventually representing an evolutionary precursor
 <cit> .

previous studies have suggested that fr <dig> is exclusively expressed by splenic lymphocytes, especially the t lymphocytes, and mature thymocytes. subsequent study identified particularly high expression in the ntregs t cell subpopulation
 <cit> . in our current study, we found that fr4d <dig> was expressed in cd4+cd25+ tregs at a higher level than in either cd4+cd25- or cd8+ t cells, suggesting that the expression of fr4d <dig> was cell type-specific. retroviral transduction of foxp <dig>  which can functionally and phenotypically convert normal t cells to natural treg-like cells
 <cit> , has revealed that the fr <dig> expression was proportional to that of foxp <dig> in foxp3-transduced cd25-cd4+ t cells, suggesting that foxp <dig> can control, either directly or indirectly, the expression of fr <dig> in natural treg cells
 <cit> . further research is necessary to determine whether transduction with foxp <dig> is also sufficient to mediate fr4d <dig> up-regulation.

as previously described for cd4+cd25+ tregs, the anergic state of a pure cd4+cd25+ treg subpopulation is abrogated after simultaneous stimulation of t cell receptors  and cd <dig> in the presence of il-2; neither il- <dig> nor plate-bound anti-cd <dig> combined with soluble anti-cd <dig> could resolve the cells’ unresponsiveness
 <cit> . furthermore, the capacity to efficiently bind and incorporate folic acid is linked to cellular proliferation, in both normal and tumorigenic conditions. in our current study, we found that overexpressing fr4d <dig> or fr <dig> in cd4+cd25+ tregs could further enhance the proliferation induced by fa, il- <dig>  and anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig>  in vitro. these results suggested that high expression of fr4d <dig> could facilitate binding of fa and cellular uptake, which may be critical to support the substantial proliferative capacity of tregs in vivo. of course, the fr4d <dig> may have other yet unrecognized functions, which will require further investigation. we also found that the fa + il-2+ anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> induced proliferative capacity of cd4+cd25+ tregs overexpressing fr4d <dig> was weaker than in cd4+cd25+ tregs overexpressing fr <dig>  these results suggested that the exon 3-related sequences contribute to optimal fa binding and/or cellular uptake mediated by fr <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified a novel exon 3-deleted fr <dig> transcript variant, which encodes a  <dig> bp truncated protein that is predominantly expressed in cd4+cd25+ treg cells. the high expression of fr4d <dig> in cd4+cd25+ tregs may modulate the ability of these cells to bind and incorporate folic acid, possibly in normal or pathogenic conditions that would benefit from enhanced proliferation of these cells.
