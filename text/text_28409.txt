BACKGROUND
infection with chlamydia pneumoniae  usually causes acute respiratory tract infections  <cit> . chronical infection with cpn may also contribute to formation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions apart from the classical risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia  <cit> . cpn has been extensively studied in the context of atherosclerosis  <cit>  because atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death in the united states, europe and much of asia  <cit> . the obligate intracellular bacterium has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction and electron microscopy  <cit>  and has also been cultured from atheromatous plaques  <cit> . on the cellular level smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the intima have been found to be infected with cpn  <cit> . in general terms, if the inflammatory response does not effectively neutralize or remove the offending agents, such as cpn, it can continue indefinitely resulting in the progression of the disease  <cit> .

chlamydiae exhibit a unique developmental cycle with two morphological distinct infectious and reproductive forms: the elementary- and the reticulate body. the life cycle proceeds for  <dig> –  <dig> h and ends with pathogen release that may damage the host cells  <cit> . infection with this pathogen is accompanied by cytoplasmic alterations and damage of the host cells  <cit> . a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic influences by chlamydia can be postulated. on one hand it has been shown that chlamydia psittaci and chlamydia trachomatis can induce apoptosis in vitro  <cit> . on the other hand established cell lines infected with cpn or chlamydia trachomatis were protected from apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli  <cit> . most of the studies investigating pro- and anti-apoptotic activity of cpn were performed in tumor cells or established cell lines. since the character of cell death is affected by host cell type and chlamydia strain it is of relevance to determine cell death in chlamydia infected primary cells  <cit> . as regards the role of cpn in atherosclerosis we need to understand death promoting and inhibiting capacities of cpn in primary cultures of vascular cells.

human aortic smooth muscle cells  play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions  <cit> . therefore, we sought to clarify the nature of cell death induced by cpn in hasmc.

apoptosis and necrosis represent two extreme morphologically defined forms of cell death  <cit> . recently the hybrid term aponecrosis was introduced describing the incomplete execution of the internal apoptotic pathway and the following necrotic degeneration  <cit> . whether smooth muscle cell death is apoptotic, necrotic or even aponecrotic in nature would predictably influence the inflammatory response in the plaque. necrotic cells releasing their contents provoke inflammation, whereas in apoptosis dead cells are ingested by neighboring cells and, therefore, do not provoke an inflammatory response  <cit> . in order to characterize the fate of hasmc following infection with cpn we analyzed cell death by morphological and biochemical methods.

RESULTS
various morphological characteristics of bacterial infection in hasmc
in order to examine the morphological characteristics of cpn infection hasmc as well as the tumor cell line hep- <dig> were infected with cpn-k <dig> and cpn-vr <dig>  respectively, and stained after  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h with anti-cpn-momp antibody. according to the staining protocol intra- and extracellular localization of cpn could be distinguished . already after  <dig> h, but also after  <dig> h and  <dig> h, hasmc as well as hep- <dig> cells were infected with numerous bacteria. round or oval shaped smooth bordered intracellular inclusions were found in tumor cells  as well as hasmc . in contrast to tumor cells in primary hasmc cpn were found also as single or rarely as irregular shaped, aggregated immunoreactive spots . quantification of morphology in hasmc revealed that after  <dig> h all cells were infected with at least one chlamydial spot . approximately 25% of the cells carried one or multiple inclusions. the different morphological characteristics in hasmc  could also be discriminated  <dig> h post infection. the ratio of cells carrying inclusions versus cells carrying spots was much higher in hep- <dig> cells compared to hasmc irrespective of the infectious dose . this ratio did not considerably vary between different cpn strains k <dig> and vr <dig> or as a function of the number of bacteria used for infection. spots were usually much lower in number and not as prominently observed in hep- <dig> cells compared to hasmc . in hasmc the number of spots increased with higher infectious doses while at the same time the number of inclusions remained constant  in contrast to cpn infections of hep- <dig> cells where more inclusions were formed at higher infectious doses without an increase of spots.

cpn lyse hasmc in a dose-dependent manner
to compare the lytic capacity of different cpn isolates and to identify a possible time course of host cell death during the chlamydial infectious cycle, ldh release of hasmc was analyzed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection.

hasmc were inoculated with two different cpn isolates: cpn-vr <dig> and cpn-k <dig> at serial 2-fold dilutions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> inclusion forming unit /cell . both isolates were found to be free of mycoplasma spec. contamination as assessed by pcr. ldh release of mock treated hasmc or of cells inoculated with heat inactivated bacteria was comparable to the spontaneous ldh release of uninfected cells .

both cpn isolates lysed hasmc in a strictly dose dependent fashion at all time points analyzed. cpn mediated host cell lysis at  <dig> h post infection is shown in figure 3a. data obtained from  <dig> h and  <dig> h post infection were similar and consistent with the displayed data subset. the levels of hasmc lysis induced by infection with  <dig> ifu/cell of cpn-k <dig>  and cpn-vr <dig>  indicate large differences in the lytic capabilities of both cpn isolates. comparison of cpn-induced ldh release at different time points  demonstrated a constant increase in chlamydia-specific hasmc lysis indicating continuous triggering of cell death throughout the whole infectious cycle . in order to reach the same amount of hasmc lysis   <dig> ifu/cell of cpn-vr <dig> and  <dig> ifu/cell of cpn-k <dig> respectively were required. this suggests that for a given degree of hasmc lysis either high amounts of a lytically less active isolate or lower amounts of a lytically more active isolate are required.

cpn infection of hasmc causes nuclear chromatin condensation as well as extensive damage of organelles and cell membrane
in order to discriminate between apoptotic and necrotic cell death of infected hasmc ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy  was carried out. as a control apoptosis was induced by treatment with the well described kinase inhibitor staurosporin.

untreated hasmc had an elongated nucleus rich in euchromatin with one or two well-defined nucleoli . the cytoplasm was scattered by numerous narrow-spaced profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum , a small golgi complex and single elongated mitochondria. in cpn infected cultures a variable number of hasmc harbored large inclusions containing many infectious elementary bodies and metabolically active reticular bodies . the nucleus of these cells was slightly rounded but chromatin structure as well as morphology of organelles was unchanged. a large number of infected hasmc without cpn inclusions were destroyed . the round shaped nuclei showed a distinct condensation of heterochromatin and condensed nucleoli. cell organelles including mitochondria and rer profiles were dilated and cell membranes were completely disrupted. detection of single bacteria by tem was possible only on rare occasions since distorted organelles in dying cells were barely distinguishable from cpn.

apoptotic hasmc treated with staurosporin showed a distinct condensation of chromatin  and nuclei were fragmented frequently; damage of cell membranes and swelling of organelles appeared to a lower extent than in cpn infected hasmc.

in general the overall ultrastructural morphology of hasmc infected with spot-like cpn infection suggests a hybrid form of cell death: it shares chromatin condensation with apoptosis and damage of organelles and membranes with necrosis.

spot-like infection induces aponecrotic morphology in hasmc
the combination of chromatin staining by dapi with labeling of dna strand breaks via tunel staining and assessment of membrane integrity by nhs-biotin staining allows a distinction between necrosis as well as early and late phases of apoptosis using confocal laser scanning microscopy  <cit> . cells dying by necrosis exhibit nhs-biotin labeling of the cytoplasm but not chromatin condensation or tunel staining of nuclei. cells in early phases of apoptosis display nuclei with condensed or fragmented chromatin, with or without tunel staining, and are surrounded by nhs-biotin negative cytoplasm due to intact cell membranes. in late phases of the apoptotic cell death tunel positive nuclei occur together with a nhs-biotin positive cytoplasm.

hasmc were infected with cpn for chosen periods of time or were inoculated with mock isolates or treated with staurosporin. cells infected with cpn-vr <dig>  showed an identical staining pattern as cells infected with cpn-k <dig> .

mock inoculated cells displayed round or oval shaped nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin visualized by dapi staining and were always tunel negative. nhs-biotin was bound exclusively to the cell surface indicating intact membranes .

in cpn infected cultures a variable labeling pattern of hasmc was observed. cells with cpn inclusions always displayed normal chromatin staining and no tunel or nhs-biotin labeling . hasmc with spot-like infection either contained an unaltered nucleus and nhs-biotin negative cytoplasm  or showed a tunel positive nucleus with condensed chromatin embedded in nhs-biotin stained cytoplasm . in hasmc displaying both cpn spots and aggregates the nucleus was always labeled by tunel and the cytoplasm by nhs-biotin . cpn-infected hasmc never showed membrane damage in combination with an unaltered nucleus, representing necrotic cell death. cpn-infected hasmc displaying tunel positive nuclei and damaged membranes could be detected at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection.  <dig> h post infection was the earliest time point when tunel positive nuclei could be detected, suggesting induction of apoptosis during the whole life cycle of cpn . tunel-positive hasmc were found even at infectious doses of  <dig> ifu / cell for cpn-vr <dig> and  <dig> ifu / cell for cpn-k <dig> and the amount of tunel-positive hasmc increased strictly dependent on the chlamydial dose used for infection . again, both cpn strains used in this study elicited the same features of cell death in hasmc according to the infection morphology. identical to the lytic capacity  of these strains, k <dig> had to be used at higher ifu compared to vr <dig> to generate a similar number of cells with tunel-positive nuclei and nhs-biotin positive cytoplasm. in contrast to hasmc neither cpn-k <dig> nor cpn-vr <dig> induced a concentration dependent increase in tunel positive nuclei in hep- <dig> cells and numbers of tunel positive nuclei remained below 10% .

in staurosporin treated cells the rounded nuclei were fragmented or exhibited chromatin that was condensed marginally, whereas nhs-biotin labeling was predominantly negative . just a minority of the cells revealed a condensed tunel-positive nucleus and at the same time were also nhs-biotin positive reflecting late stages of apoptotic cell death.

cpn infection induces phosphatidylserine externalization in hasmc
hasmc were infected for  <dig> h with cpn-k <dig> or -vr <dig> in 2-fold dilutions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> ifu/cell or from  <dig> to  <dig> ifu/cell, respectively. as controls cultures were inoculated with mock isolates or with heat inactivated bacteria  and analyzed for annexin-v binding and propidium iodide uptake. uninfected as well as na-azide treated hasmc served as negative and staurosporin-treated cells as positive controls for apoptosis . control cultures inoculated with mock lysate  or heat inactivated bacteria and untreated cells showed always less than 20% annexin-v single positive cells. this proportion of annexin-v positive cells represented background staining, probably due to the experimental procedure. upon infection with  <dig> ifu/cell of cpn-k <dig> for  <dig> h the number of single annexin-v positive cells increased to more than 50% . upon cpn infection annexin-v and propidium iodide double-positive staining reached 10% as compared with 4% in mock-inoculated and 3% in untreated hasmc . in staurosporin treated cultures the amount of both annexin-v single and double positive cells increased strongly  indicating a continued induction of classical apoptotic cell death.

the amount of annexin-v single positive hasmc infected with cpn increased linearly in a dose-  and time-  dependent manner. cpn-vr <dig> again induced phosphatidylserine externalization at much lower doses compared to cpn-k <dig>  neither mock inoculation , nor inoculation with heat inactivated bacteria , induced apoptosis. this indicates that infection with living bacteria is required for induction of cell-death.

taken together, the dose- and time dependence between infection and phosphatidylserine externalization were consistent with induction of early apoptotic events.

chlamydia infection in hasmc induces caspase- <dig> independent cell death by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential
after induction of apoptosis an enzymatic cascade is activated leading to the disassembly of the cell  <cit> . key enzyme in this cascade is caspase- <dig>  however, in some cases apoptosis can proceed without involvement of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . in order to investigate the role of caspase- <dig> hasmc were infected with cpn-k <dig>  <dig> ifu/cell or cpn-vr <dig>  <dig> ifu/cell, respectively, for  <dig> h  or treated with  <dig> μm staurosporin for  <dig> h to induce apoptosis. samples were analyzed for caspase- <dig> activation by measuring enzyme activity after lysing the cells. no activity of caspase- <dig> in cpn infected hasmc  could be detected. in contrast distinct caspase- <dig> activity was found in staurosporin-treated cells.

a major role in the induction and regulation of cell death is played by mitochondria. pro-apoptotic factors result at mitochondria in the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. after infection of hasmc with cpn-k <dig> or cpn-vr <dig> cells were loaded with tmre   <cit> , a dye, that is only taken up into mitochondria with an intact mitochondrial potential  <cit> . cells with intact membranes excluding propidium iodide were analyzed by flow cytometry.

the number of tmre negative cells strictly increased with the chlamydial dose whereas blocking of chlamydial protein synthesis by addition of chloramphenicol completely abrogated this effect . moreover, labeling of cpn-k <dig> infected or mock treated cells for cytochrome c and mitotracker red revealed distinct loss of cytochrome c staining of the mitochondria in the infected population  but not in mock treated cells .

taken together, the data suggest chlamydia pneumoniae induce caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death in infected hasmc by involving mitochondrial membrane dissipation resulting in the release of cytochrome c.

discussion
in our in vitro study cell death was only induced in hasmc by infection with viable cpn but not after incubation with heat inactivated or chloramphenicol treated bacteria. additionally, different cpn isolates showed various lytic activities towards host cells that correlated to different reproduction rates in tumor cells as measured by real time pcr  <cit> . a reproductive infection would seem to be a prerequisite for cell death induction in hasmc. the observation that heat inactivated or chloramphenicol treated bacteria never caused changes of the host cells underlines that cell death induction is not a bystander effect of a potential cytopathic chlamydial component such as the heat stable lps. it can be concluded that hasmc death depends on internalization of the chlamydia and is associated with the suppression of bacterial replication and productive infection. the necessity for a reproductive infection was also shown for chlamydia psittaci which induced caspase  <dig> independent apoptosis in macrophages and epithelial cells only after reproductive infection along with bacterial protein synthesis  <cit> . cell death induction was never found in cells harbouring inclusions which normally are viewed as the manifestation of a reproductive infection. hasmc formed inclusions with a relatively low frequency compared to tumor cells. in contrast, spots resulting presumably from single bacteria were found frequently illustrating a different infection morphology of cpn in these primary vascular cells. currently no data are available regarding metabolism, protein synthesis and reproduction or functional relation with host cells of these single, spot-like bacteria. from our data it only can be concluded that these single bacteria are sensitive to chloramphenicol which inhibits protein synthesis in cpn and abrogates cell death induction. cell death seems to result from an interaction of the host cell with these single bacteria as it is ongoing for extended times.

cpn induced cell death in hasmc did not fulfill all criteria for apoptosis or classical necrosis. condensation of chromatin, positive tunel staining, externalization of phosphatidylserine, inhibition of tmre labeling and loss of cytochrome c immunoreactivity in mitochondria were clear markers for apoptosis. but early damage of cell membrane and organelles as found by tem and nhs-biotin labeling indicated necrotic type of cell death in cpn infected cells. according to previous classifications cpn mediated cell death belongs to apoptosis-like cell death  <cit>  or can be termed aponecrosis due to characteristic ultrastructural features  <cit> . cpn induced cell death in hasmc having features of necrosis and apoptosis is in agreement with a study employing mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with c. trachomatis which died through a combination of necrosis and apoptosis  <cit> .

if cell death induction by cpn in hasmc is caspase- <dig> independent the question arises about alternative pathways that are involved. mitochondria are important regulators of cell death and loss of mitochondrial permeability transition is an important indication for apoptosis  <cit> . here we show by tmre labeling dissipation of the mitochondrial potential of chlamydia infected cells. this effect could be inhibited by blocking bacterial protein synthesis using chloramphenicol. moreover, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria of infected hasmc as indicated by loss of immunorecactivity. the important role of mitochondria in chlamydia induced cell death has also been shown in tumor cell lines infected with chlamydia psittaci  <cit> . pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family members like bax were activated and apoptosis induction occurred during the whole chlamydial life cycle. apoptosis induced by chlamydia psittaci was blocked in cells over expressing bax inhibitor and anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig>  <cit> . bax-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts were shown to be resistant to chlamydia muridarum-induced apoptosis and fewer bacteria were recovered after two infection cycles. this suggests that bax-dependent apoptosis may be used to initiate a new round of infection  <cit> . in a second study, chlamydia trachomatis infected mouse fibroblasts showed a higher level of apoptosis than chlamydia infected hela cells as measured by annexin v / propidium iodide double labeling  <cit> . this not only shows that bax activation could reflect a stress response in infected cells  <cit>  but that primary cells show a different stress response to chlamydia infection than tumor cells.

beside bax other factors like apoptosis-inducing factor  may be involved in caspase-independent cell death  <cit>  but they have never been investigated in chlamydia-induced cell death. aif which is upregulated and translocated from the mitochondria to the cytosol may play an important role in induction of caspase- <dig> independent cell death  <cit> . injection of aif into the cytoplasm induces similar chromatin condensation coupled to phosphatidylserine exposure as we found in cpn infected hasmc  <cit> . future experiments will have to show if aif, bax or other bcl- <dig> family members are involved in cpn induced hasmc death.

there exist numerous studies showing that cpn and chlamydia trachomatis prevent cells in vitro from undergoing apoptosis  <cit> . however, these experiments were performed on established cell lines. our study shows that in primary cultures of cells such as hasmc various types of cpn infection occur. spot like infection resulted in aponecrosis whereas cells with cpn inclusions appeared to be prevented from cell death. apparently cpn in inclusions have evolved strategies to inhibit cell death presumably to complete the developmental cycle. about possible mechanisms can be speculated: it has been shown that cpn inserts components of a type-iii secretion system into the inclusion membrane  <cit>  and releases factors into the host cell  <cit>  that affect host cell metabolism. cpn secretes proteins that translocate from the inclusion to the cytoplasm  <cit> . cadd, a secreted protein from chlamydia trachomatis, has been shown to interact with death domains and co-localizes with fas. recombinant cadd has been shown to induce caspase dependent apoptosis in several tumor cell lines  <cit> . therefore, other yet unidentified proteins from chlamydia could interact with the host cell death machinery and inhibit or promote cell death.

currently, it is unclear how the observed morphology of cpn in hasmc and the induced aponecrotic cell death affects the progression of atherosclerosis. cpn infection of hasmc was accompanied by phosphatidylserine externalization which might result in the ingestion of dying cells by macrophages. macrophages will then either stop further progress of cpn mediated damage or in turn become activated and thereby contribute to inflammation in the atherosclerotic vessel  <cit> . early membrane damage found in the aponecrotic hasmc may provoke or assist inflammation in the atherosclerotic vessel due to release of cellular constituents. finally damage of vascular smooth muscle cells by cpn infection might lead to plaque instability  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cpn infection of cultured hasmc results in cell death that can be termed aponecrosis due to the sharing of apoptotic and necrotic features. this form of cell death occurs just in cells bearing single or aggregated bacteria but not in cells with inclusions. aponecrotic hasmc may in vivo assist chronic infection in the vascular wall supporting the progression of atherosclerosis.
