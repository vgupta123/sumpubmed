BACKGROUND
insertion sequences  and their non autonomous derivatives known as miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  are the simplest kinds of prokaryotic mobile dna. iss are small dna segments ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb, generally encoding a transposase that catalyses the mobility of the elements. most iss are surrounded by terminal inverted repeats  and flanked by direct repeats . mites are thought to be originated from internal deletion of complete iss and generally lack any recognizable open reading frames . they use the transposases encoded by the corresponding full elements in trans for their mobility  <cit> .

iss and mites abundance in prokaryotic genomes is highly variable  <cit>  but they generally occupy a substantial fraction, up to 40% in the orientia tsutsugamushi genome  <cit>  with an average of  <dig> to 10% in bacteria  <cit>  and archaea  <cit> . in addition, metagenomic analyses revealed that transposases are the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature  <cit> . the quantitative importance of iss is coupled with a large diversity of families and mechanisms of transposition. based on transposase sequence similarities, iss have been classified in  <dig> different families that belong to three main classes of enzymes: the dde transposase, the serine recombinase and the tyrosine recombinase  <cit> . consequently, iss are considered as major players of genome evolution and plasticity, mediating gene transfers and promoting genome duplication, deletion and rearrangement  <cit> . due to their abundance and diversity, iss and mites identification and annotation have represented a longstanding challenge, partially solved with the availability of a reference database that compile a large body of iss . thus, several studies have used the referenced sequences in the isfinder database to mine various collections of genomic data using blast softwares . however, with the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques leading to the availability of thousands complete genomes and metagenomes, iss and mites identification and annotation require more sophisticated and integrated approaches. recently, issaga have been then developed to automate is annotation in complete genomes  <cit> . issaga used a relatively simple library-based methods using blast seeded with the isfinder sequences and classify them into families. although issaga have represented a significant progress in the field, the efficiency of library-based approaches in identifying transposable elements is questionable for two reasons. first, the efficiency of library based method is critically dependent on the quality and the exhaustiveness of the database used. several families such as is <dig> for example display extremely elevated levels of divergence, with many emerging clusters that show very weak level of sequence conservation with the other members of the family  <cit> . other families such as is <dig> for example show a very low sampling effort with only twenty sequences present in isfinder, mainly in a single bacterial clade . second, library-based methods are unable to identify new families that display no similarities with existing families. this limit is especially problematic with mites that do not encode for a transposase and that display low level of similarities with autonomous iss  <cit> . for this reason, in eukaryotes more than  <dig> different methods have been developed to identify and annotate transposable elements  <cit> . these methods could be divided in library based method and de novo methods. de novo methods do not need a set of reference sequences to works: they used various approaches relying on the structural properties of the transposable elements as the presence of terminal repeats or the fact that transposons are generally duplicated in multiple copies in a given genome. however it’s striking that de novo methods have been underused to mine prokaryotic genomes. thus, the goal of this study was to develop alternative and more elaborate methods than blast-based approaches to improve iss and mites identification. we build three new pipelines, two using de novo methods  and the third one using an alternative library-based method with profile hidden markov models  searches.

we tested these different pipelines against different datasets:

– a genomic dataset of  <dig> archaeal genomes previously annotated by us for iss and mites with a blast-based method  <cit> . our results demonstrate that de novo methods increased significantly iss  and mites  identification compared to library based methods. the gain was important with highly divergent families such as is <dig> or is200/ <dig> and for mites that display only very weak similarities with previously identified iss. in addition to be fast, reliable for non-specialist users and generating low level of false positive, these methods offer the advantage to produce outputs with complete is sequences  directly usable for databases as isfinders. similar results were obtained using  <dig> additional bacterial genomes annotated in the isfinder database.

– we also tested some marine metagenomic datasets including samples composed of  <dig> kb reads and  <dig> bp reads. our results show that hmm searches outclass a blast-based approach, finding many more transposase genes  and generating a considerable lower level of false positive compared to blast. thus, we suggested that blast based methods should be avoided to detect transposase on metagenomic data and should be reserved to the final annotation step in order to class the elements by is families. moreover future studies on iss and mites may combine at least one de novo method of detection in addition to a library based approach.

methods
overview
in order to improve iss and mites identification, we have constructed three different work-flows: two de novo pipelines that search for repeats sequences and for inverted repeats  and a library-based pipeline using hmm alignment profile searches. these methods were then benchmarked using genomic and metagenomic datasets.

de novo pipelines
our de novo pipelines used two different approaches to detect iss and mites . the first one called “repeats search”  used the repeatscout algorithm  <cit> . repeatscout detects repeated sequences in a given genome and generates a consensus of these sequences . the second path called “irs search”  used the palindrome software of the emboss package  <cit>  which identifies the irs in the input sequences . all sequences delimited by ir pairs are then extracted. in order to avoid doubleton, sequences bordered with irs but present less than  <dig> times were removed. the consensus sequences generated by repeatscout and the sequences delimited by ir following palindrome were then clustered using uclust with default parameters  <cit> . at this stage, we have a list of clusters of putative mites and iss. for the putative iss  we compiled exhaustively all the related sequences  using a blastn   <cit>  against the genome. for the mite candidates  we need to identify the autonomous partners to be sure that these sequences are true transposable elements. we acquired the terminal  <dig> bp at each end of the sequence  and used this sequence to blastn  the genome. we obtained a list of sequences that are present between the two matching terminal  <dig> bp. these sequences were filtered to be smaller than  <dig> kb and doubletons were removed. finally the nested elements  are separated and reconstructed separately. these potential partners were then blasted  against the isfinder database  to be certain that these sequences are homologous to bona fide iss. at the end of the process, we obtain a list of files with all the putative iss and a file containing all the mites with the corresponding autonomous partners.

profile hmm pipeline
the “profile hmm search” pipeline used in entry files either the complete genomes  or the list of orfs . in the first case, as profile search methods proceed with protein sequences only, the genome is then cut in  <dig> kb segment and translated using a six frames window. transposase sequences are searched using the hmmpfam software of the hmmer <dig>  <cit>  package using  <dig> transposase sequence profiles . these profiles were built as follow: for each family, all the sequences present in the isfinder database have been retrieved according to their family name. for underrepresented families in isfinder as is <dig> for example, additional homologous sequences were retrieved using blastp  searches against a nr database maintained locally and regularly updated . for large families with little similarities between subgroups we have generated several different profiles . these sets of sequences are aligned with muscle  <cit> , alignments are refined manually using the jalview sequence editor  <cit>  and the profiles are then constructed using the hmmbuild software  <cit> . sensitivity of the profiles has been improved using the calibration software hmmcalibrate. the sequences encoding a putative transposase identified using these profiles are extracted and clustered using the uclust  <cit>  softwares and the sequence clusters are finally aligned with muscle  <cit> . at the end of the pipeline we will have a list of files containing the different clusters of related sequences encoding a putative transposase.

test with prokaryotic genomes
the benchmarking of our different methods has been tested against a set of  <dig> archaeal genomes previously annotated by us for iss and mites  <cit> . in this previous study, iss have been identified using a blastp-based approache against isfinder and mites have been identified using blastn with the is sequences previously identified . all of these annotated transposons and their respective coordinates in the genomes were downloaded from the isfinder database and compared with those identified with our pipelines. additionally, we have randomly chosen  <dig> bacterial genomes available in the isfinder database that cover the major bacterial phyla  and compared the performance of our pipelines with the isfinder annotations.

test with metagenomic datasets
we have tested the hmm pipeline against a simulated metagenomic dataset and a real set of metagenomic sequences. the simulated datasets correspond to the genome of the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus that has been fragmented in  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp sequences to resemble of typical metagenomic reads generated by sanger or ngs methods. we have chosen the genome of sulfolobus solfataricus because it offers the advantage to carry a very large panel of iss  in addition to a large diversity of sequences . the real dataset have been chosen randomly from the camera database at http://camera.calit <dig> net:  the pacific beach sand metagenome composed of  <dig> non-redundant sequences for a total of approximately  <dig> mb ,  the marine sar <dig> bacterial clade metagenome composed of  <dig> sequences for a total of approximately  <dig>  mb  and  the sargasso sea metagenome jcvi_smpl_ <dig> with  <dig>  <dig> sequences for a total of  <dig>  mb . performance of the hmm pipeline were compared with the results obtained with a blastx against the isfinder sequences  with e value = 10e- <dig>  each alignment was checked manually to avoid false positives and ambiguous cases were blasted against a nr database to identify homologous sequences .

technical details
pipelines were written either in perl  or python . computation described in this article were performed on a unix server . the full de novo pipelines analysis for the  <dig> genomes was done in approximately  <dig> hours, where as the hmm pipeline, with the  <dig> transposase alignment profiles were performed in approximately  <dig> hours. the calculation time for the metagenome dataset using the hmm profiles scales linearly with the number of sequences, in average  <dig> minutes per  <dig> reads.

RESULTS
pipelines validation: test with  <dig> archaeal and  <dig> bacterial genomes
we constructed three different work-flows: two de novo pipelines that search for repeats sequences  and for inverted repeats  and a library-based pipeline using hmm alignment profile searches. these methods were then tested using diverse genomic and metagenomic datasets. we first validated the performance of our different pipelines by detecting the presence of  <dig> different iss and  <dig> different mites previously identified by blast in a set of  <dig> archaeal genomes  <cit> . the respective performances of the different methods are given in table  <dig>  the performances of the hmm pipeline fed with  <dig> transposase alignment profiles with the blast searches against isfinder sequences are globally comparable. three known single copies have been lost during the hmm search process but  <dig> new multi-copies iss have been identified. by contrast, our de novo pipelines improve significantly iss and mites annotation. repeats search increased notably the number of multi-copy iss compared to blast  and clearly outclasses the latter concerning mites identification . however, repeats search generates a significant level of false positives that correspond to various other kind of mobile elements such as group-ii intron encoding a reverse transcriptase or conserved genes in prophage as integrase, in addition to several duplicate genes as rdna 16s for example. nevertheless as these false positive hits encoded for highly conserved and generally well annotated genes, they could be easily filtered with a simple blastx against a nr database at the end of the process. alternatively, an increase of the copy number repeats threshold to  <dig> or  <dig> instead of  <dig> removed most of these false hits but it will also decrease significantly the sensitivity of the pipeline. conversely, irs searches give no false positives but seem less powerful to detect iss . this is directly related to the fact that several is families as is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> do not displays terminal ir. if we excluded these families, the ir searches give comparable results to the repeats search with the detection of  <dig> additional new iss. in fact, symmetrically with the repeats search, the irs search turn out to be especially efficient to detect mites with an increase of about 50% compared to blast. taken together, combination of our de novo pipelines allows us to detect  <dig> new iss  and  <dig> new mites  compared to the blast-based approach .

additionally, we have also tested a sample of  <dig> bacterial genomes annotated in the isfinder database . performances of the different pipelines are remarkably similar with those obtained with archaeal genomes. the best performances are provided by the repeats search pipeline  and the hmm pipelines. the ir search give even better results with the bacterial dataset  compared with the archaeal datasets . this result is mainly due to the weaker proportion of is families that do not displayed irs in the bacterial dataset as is <dig> and is <dig> families. finally, it should be noted that our de novo pipelines detected  <dig> potential mites in the bacterial genomes , a proportion roughly comparable with the archaeal genomes .

finally, de novo methods provide output files directly usable for transposon databases ie providing the complete transposon sequence, not only the transposase sequences . finding the complete sequence  of a transposon detected on the basis of its transposase may appears trivial, but this task is in fact time-consuming and not easy to automate. eye examination of the local alignment sequence bordering the transposase is generally required and the issaga software developed to find transposases do not provide options to find the complete corresponding is sequences. by providing simple and fast methods to find the complete sequence of the transposon, de novo methods implemented in this study offer sensitive and reliable ways to find the complete sequence of the transposon. nevertheless, de novo methods are unable to identify single copy iss which represent a significant fraction of the total diversity of is in prokaryotic genomes . this limitation is inherent to the de novo methodologies which filter the candidate sequences on the basis of their repetitions. consequently, an exhaustive study of is needs optimally the combination of library-based and de novo methods. in a long term, by feeding the sequence libraries with the recursive use of de novo methods, we can expect to cover a sufficient sequence space to solely used similarity-searches methods. however, it seems quite evident that our present knowledge of the true diversity of transposons in the prokaryotic world is highly incomplete. thus, we recommend that future studies on iss and mites may combine de novo and library-based methods, ideally irs search, repeats search and profile hmm search.

sulfolobus datasets correspond to in silico fragmented genomes and the results indicated the number of individual transposases identified. for the real marine metagenomes, the results indicate the number of apparent true transposases identified  in addition to the numbers of false positives. na: not applicable .

pipelines validation: test with simulated and real metagenomes
metagenomic data differ notably from traditional genomic data by the short size of the reads that severely complicate gene annotation  <cit> . we have compared the respective performance of the hmm-search pipelines compared to a blast-based method with the isfinder sequences. we tested four different metagenomes: three simulated metagenomes consisting of the genome of sulfolobus solfataricus fragmented in  <dig> kb,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp segments, and three marine metagenomes composed of  <dig> kb,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp reads. for the latter, we have carefully checked the sequence alignments to avoid false  positives to be sure that the identified iss are true elements.

concerning the fragmented sulfolobus genome, the hmm search pipeline leaded to the identification of  <dig>   <dig> copies and  <dig> out of  <dig>  identified with blast . it should be noted that isfinder database already contains all the sulfolobus iss, consequently the result obtained by blast correspond to an optimum. thus it’s not surprising that the profile hmm searches do not fit exactly with the blast approches. in fact, all the transposases missed by the profile hmm pipeline with  <dig> kb and  <dig> bp belong to a single group of is <dig> elements  which show only very weak similarities to other is <dig> elements and also vary significantly among themselves. moreover, the spacing of the dde catalytic residues does not align with that of other is <dig> family members  <cit>  and this would probably explain the difficulties to identify them based of alignment profiles search methods. finally, due to the lack of sequence similarities with very short input sequences, the performance of the hmm pipelines with  <dig> bp fragments decreases strongly.

concerning the “real” metagenomic datasets, the results vary according to the size of the reads . with the  <dig> kb reads  the efficiency of the hmm pipeline is considerably better than blast . in addition, blast tends to generate a lot of false positives displaying very short aligned regions  . for example, with the jcvi sample, the number of false positives corresponds to  <dig> hits for  <dig> apparent “true” iss. to reduce the level of false positives, it’s possible to decrease of the blast e values threshold to have a more stringent criterion of similarities. this option dramatically reduced the numbers of hits: for example, with e value = 10e- <dig> instead of 10e- <dig>  the number of iss identified in the jcvi sample is divided by a factor  <dig>  at the opposite, the hmm search gives a very low level of false positives . with hmm searches, some metagenomic sequences also lead to multiple matches with two or three different profiles. this phenomenon is frequent with dde families with overlapping sequence spaces, as observed with the elements matching with the is <dig> profile in addition to the is <dig> and/or is <dig> profiles. this may complicate the eventual annotation of the corresponding sequences and it seems useful to combine the hmm search  with a blast search against isfinder to annotate by families the previously identified sequences.

concerning the sample composed of short reads as the sar <dig> clade metagenome , the efficiencies of both methods seem equally limited  and it seems obvious that many elements have been missed compared to the results obtained with the  <dig> kb sequence samples. in addition, the short sizes of the aligned sequences complicate seriously the identification and the removal of the false positives. in conclusion, the sensitivity of the hmm searches makes this method more successful than blast to identify iss on metagenomic samples, generating less false positives and providing a better picture of the is diversity. the only limitation seems to be the size of the reads, short sequences  appearing too small to provide enough sequence information to identify iss.

description of the new iss found with the de novo methods
utilization of the two de novo pipelines with the  <dig> archaeal genomes allowed us to discover  <dig> new iss . a majority of these iss does not belong to known families or displays little similarities with existing ones . this would explain why library-based methods failed to identify them. these elements display typical transposon structure: duplication in multiple copies, presence of irs at the extremities and sometimes generation of target site duplication . as all these elements have closed homologs in diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes, they could belong to previously unidentified emerging families. we also observed an apparent overrepresentation of members of the is200/is <dig> family: four of them display enough sequence conservation to be associated with this family. absence of identification of these elements during the initial study with a blast-based approach in  <dig> is more puzzling. the is200/is <dig> is a loosely defined family that is clearly polyphyletic: it clustered together serine recombinase type and tyrosine recombinase type enzymes. these elements have been clustered together because they may share a second and non-essential orf of unknown function  <cit> . until recently, this family has received little attention, but during the past few years many studies concerning its diversity, their mechanism of transposition and their roles on genome evolution were published  <cit> . many new sequences was probably identified and added to libraries, thus it’s then possible that the sequence sampling in the isfinder database increases enough to allow identification of more distant homologs in our archaeal genomes. additionally, we cannot rule out that these elements were missed as there is an important mass of is200/is <dig> elements present in these archaeal genomes . this situation well illustrates the fact that library based approaches critically depend on the quality and on the diversity of the sequence sampling in the database, representing a major weakness compare to de novo methods.

the host genomes and the names according the isfinder nomenclature is indicated, the is family when it was defined, the copy number , the similarity with isfinder  and the size of the irs and drs.

finally, it should be noted that we have identified with de novo methods  <dig> additional is-like elements that display typical transposon structure . these is-like elements show any sequence similarities outside their corresponding genomes. so far, the sequence sampling is not sufficient to identify catalytic motives as the dde for example to be certain that these elements are bona fine transposable elements. it should be noted that several similar “orphans”iss have already been reported in archaea, mainly in halophilic and methanogens species  <cit> . thus, we can hypothesize that these  <dig> elements are true and additional new transposons belonging to rare and unknown is families. increasing availability of new genomes and metagenomes will definitively validate  this assumption.

description of the new mites found with de novo methods
due to the lack of any orfs, mites are difficult to detect with library-based approaches. nevertheless,  <dig> mites families have been evidenced in the  <dig> archaeal genomes studied previously  <cit> . these elements have been detected on the basis of their overall sequence similarities with autonomous iss, using a simple blastn against each genome seeded with the complete sequence of the iss previously identified. with the implementation of de novo methods, we have now identified  <dig> new mites . unlike the new autonomous iss identified in this study, there is no apparent bias towards peculiar families: the new mites derive from iss that belong to  <dig> different families, without over representation of unknown or poorly defined families as is200/ <dig> for example. these new mites are often present with quite high copy numbers , displaying typical mite structures: presence of irs that are similar with those of autonomous iss, and sometimes generation of drs. all but one are associated with previously identified iss in our earlier study  <cit> . the only exception is a mite in the thermoccocus kodakarensis genome which is associated with an is discovered in this study . this observation raises the question: why so many mites have not been detected using blast-based methods? alignments of a representative set of mite sequences with their putative autonomous is partners  show that the level of similarities between them is very low. in fact, only the borders corresponding to the irs are conserved which correspond generally to segments shorter than 20nt . even for the is200/is <dig> elements, if the 5′ ends seem to be more conserved, the 3′ ends display virtually no or very weak similarities . this would explain that a blastn seeded with the sequence of the complete iss failed to be exhaustive and missed more than 50% of the mites in our  <dig> archaeal genomes. in addition, we identified  <dig> other “mite-like” structures appearing as repeated elements displaying irs and sometimes drs. however, we failed to identify any autonomous is partner associated with them. there are two likely and not exclusive explanations for this observation:

– these elements are associated with an is that have been lost during the course of the evolution.

– they are associated with unknown iss, showing no similarities with recognized is families.

the host genomes, the potential is autonomous partner and its family when defined are indicated. lenght , copy number and size of the drs and irs are also mentioned.

thus, the apparent difficulties to identify the autonomous partner due to the high level of sequence divergence between them indicated that we underestimated the number of mites present in the archaeal genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have developed three new alternative methods to improve iss and mites identification in prokaryotic genomes. compared to a routinely used blast-based approach, de novo methods based on repeats detection and identification of the irs improve notably the detection of iss and mites. these methods have led to the identification of more than  <dig> new transposons  in a reference dataset of  <dig> archaeal genomes. de novo methods appear powerful to detect iss belonging to poorly defined families, highly divergent ones or emerging groups with no or few representatives in the sequence libraries. as mites display in prokaryotes very few sequence similarities with their autonomous is partners , the advantages of de novo methods are magnified. we also developed an alternative library-based method to detect transposases using profile hmm searches. tested against metagenomic samples, this method supplants a classic blast-based method, increasing the number of putative transposases  and generating less false positives. these results are in favor of a generalization of de novo methods in data mining for prokaryotic transposons, ideally combining a library-based method in addition to a de novo method. a better efficiency would be reach using both de novo methods  in addition to a blast or a profile hmm search. concerning metagenomes, data mining for transposase using classical blast-based methods should be replaced by profile hmm searches; blast should be used only in a second step for the annotation and the classification into families.
