BACKGROUND
members of the fungal genus colletotrichum cause anthracnose diseases on nearly every plant species grown for food or fiber worldwide  <cit> . colletotrichum graminicola  wils., and c. sublineola henn., cause economically important anthracnose leaf blight and stalk rot diseases of maize , and sorghum , respectively . these two fungal sibling species are morphologically very similar, but reproductively isolated  <cit> . results of molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that they diverged from a common ancestor relatively recently, perhaps at the same time as the split between maize and sorghum  . there are no reports in the literature of c. graminicola infecting sorghum or of c. sublineola infecting maize in the field, and most studies agree that the two species are host-specific . we have found that c. sublineola can infect maize stalk epidermal cells, and maize leaf sheath cells that are dead or dying  <cit> . this ability of c. sublineola to conditionally infect some maize tissues might explain two earlier papers that reported that maize was susceptible to isolates of colletotrichum from sorghum  <cit> . it also suggests that host range is determined by active recognition of and response to the non-pathogen by healthy tissues of the non-host, rather than structural barriers or the absence of some vital nutrient or other factor.

the determination of host range in plant pathogens is often attributed to the presence or absence of pathogen virulence factors, particularly specialized secondary metabolites , and small-secreted protein  effectors .

the presence of particular ssms has been associated with the determination of host range in some phytopathogenic fungi including alternaria spp.  <cit>  and cochliobolus spp.  <cit> . the major classes of fungal ssms include polyketides, peptides, terpenes, and indole alkaloids . each of these classes is associated with a specific family of proteins. these ssm-associated proteins are: polyketide synthases ; nonribosomal peptide synthetases ; terpene synthases ; and dimethylallyl transferases , respectively. genes encoding these enzymes and other proteins involved in the production of the ssms are often found physically associated in transcriptionally co-regulated gene clusters  <cit> .

fungal effectors have been defined as ssps that alter the structure or modulate the function of host cells to facilitate infection  <cit> . some effectors are translocated and operate in the host cytoplasm . others function in the plant cell apoplast  <cit> . some effectors act as host specific toxins and induce apoptosis only in certain plant genotypes, conferring host specificity in several important necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . examples of known effector categories include serine proteases, necrosis and ethylene-inducing protein 1-like proteins , and small cysteine-rich proteins  <cit> .

some plants have evolved an ability to recognize and respond to certain effectors by activating defense pathways via specific resistance  proteins, a phenomenon known as effector-triggered immunity . in these cases, the effectors act as avirulence  factors. multiple rounds of mutation and selection of r and avr genes during a co-evolutionary “arms-race” leads to the presence of multiple pathogenic races expressing different combinations of avr genes within the pathogen population  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that inducible non-host resistance in many agriculturally-important pathosystems, particularly involving closely related hosts, is due to eti. in these cases all members of the non-host plant species contain the same r gene, whereas all members of the nonpathogenic microbial species contain the corresponding avr gene .

a number of recent comparative genomics studies have confirmed that genes encoding ssm-associated proteins and ssps show evidence of rapid evolution in related pathogens with different host ranges . most of these studies have involved comparisons of relatively distantly related pathogens, and/or strains with diverse geographic origins. there have been comparatively few analyses of co-occurring, closely related sibling species. the goal of the present work was to identify, characterize, and compare candidate host specificity-related genes from two contemporaneous, co-occurring, host-specific strains of the sibling species c. graminicola and c. sublineola.

RESULTS
the cytology of host specificity

colletotrichum graminicola strain m <dig>  was isolated from maize in missouri in the late 1970s  <cit> . this strain caused typical, sporulating anthracnose lesions on maize leaves  within 3 days post inoculation , but on leaves of sorghum  it produced only small reddish flecks, which failed to expand or sporulate even up to  <dig> dpi . colletotrichum sublineola strain cgsl <dig> was isolated in the early 1980s from grain sorghum in indiana  <cit> . this strain caused large, sporulating anthracnose lesions on sorghum, but not on maize leaves . colletotrichum graminicola strain m <dig>  readily infected and colonized multiple cells of detached leaf sheaths of maize by 48 h after inoculation  and c. sublineola strain cgsl <dig> did the same in sorghum sheaths by  <dig> hpi . in contrast, c. graminicola failed to infect leaf sheath cells of sorghum, and c. sublineola failed to infect maize leaf sheath cells, even up to  <dig> dpi . sorghum responded within  <dig> hpi to c. graminicola appressoria by an accumulation of numerous vesicles containing red pigments, and maize responded to c. sublineola appressoria by the formation of iridescent papillae . previous studies have determined that the red pigments consist of various anthocyanidin phytoalexins  <cit> . the maize papillae are composed primarily of callose  <cit> . visible primary hyphae were always very small, and were produced in fewer than 1% of infection attempts in both non-host combinations. unpenetrated cells beneath c. sublineola appressoria in maize leaf sheaths typically retained their ability to plasmolyze even up to  <dig> hpi, but cells containing rare penetration hyphae appeared granulated, and did not plasmolyze normally . sorghum cells beneath c. graminicola appressoria usually plasmolyzed at  <dig> hpi, but by  <dig> hpi most of the cells had lost the ability to plasmolyze, whether they contained infection hyphae or not . most of the cells in the mock-inoculated maize and sorghum controls still plasmolyzed normally up to  <dig> hpi . colletotrichum sublineola and c. graminicola were able to colonize non-host leaf sheaths readily if the cells were killed first by a localized application of liquid nitrogen . these observations suggest that host specificity is based on active recognition of the non-pathogen by living non-host plant cells, followed by rapid deployment of defense responses targeting the infection sites, and ultimately plant cell death prior to, or coincident with, penetration. to identify potential candidates for factors that might trigger or facilitate this recognition, we compared the genomes of these two strains, with a particular focus on genes that were not conserved between them, and on genes encoding putative ssps and ssm-associated proteins.fig.  <dig>

the genomes of the c. graminicola and c. sublineola strains are very similar to one another, confirming their close evolutionary relationship

colletotrichum graminicola and c. sublineola belong to a monophyletic clade of closely related colletotrichum fungi that affect various graminaceous hosts  <cit> . we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of the cgsl <dig> strain of c. sublineola, and compared it with the previously published genome assembly and annotation of c. graminicola strain m <dig>   <cit> . the c. sublineola assembly was approximately 20% larger than the published m <dig>  genome assembly , although the amount of single-copy dna was similar . the c. sublineola genome was predicted to encode about  <dig> more genes than the number previously published for c. graminicola  <cit>  . both genome annotations contained homologs for most or all of a set of  <dig> phylogenetically conserved genes, as identified by cegma, aka. the core eukaryotic genes mapping approach  <cit> , suggesting that both are relatively complete .table  <dig> characteristics of the genome assemblies that were used in this study

partial sequences of four genes have been used previously for multigene phylogenetic analysis of colletotrichum  <cit> . these included portions of the act gene; the chs gene; the his <dig> gene; and the tub <dig> gene. these sequences from cgsl <dig> shared 100% identity with those of strain s. <dig>  the designated epitype specimen for c. sublineola  <cit>  . the internal transcribed spacer  sequence from cgsl <dig> also shared  <dig> % identity with the its sequence of s <dig>   <cit> . this confirms that cgsl <dig> belongs to the c. sublineola species as it is presently defined .

approximately 50% of the single-copy dna sequence in the cgsl <dig> and m <dig>  assemblies could be directly aligned by blastn . in comparison, only about 23% of the assembly of c. higginsianum, a more distantly related species pathogenic on brassicaceae, and belonging to a sister clade  <cit> , could be aligned with either of these two genomes . as expected, there were also fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms  per mb of alignable single-copy dna between c. graminicola and c. sublineola than between c. higginsianum and the other two genomes .

eighty-three percent of the c. graminicola genome assembly could be aligned with c. sublineola scaffolds based on the relative arrangement of conserved genes . more than 80% of the c. graminicola and c. sublineola genes were syntenous . regions that appear to be translocated and/or inverted, and small “islands” that appeared to lack synteny, could be discerned embedded within the largely co-linear assemblies . no part of the c. sublineola assembly could be aligned with the three c. graminicola minichromosomes , which seem to be unique to this strain of c. graminicola  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

colletotrichum graminicola and c. sublineola encode similar proteins and protein families
the protein family database   <cit>  was used to characterize and compare predicted proteins from c. graminicola and c. sublineola . only 67% of c. graminicola proteins, and 62% of c. sublineola proteins, could be categorized into pfam families. most of these families were shared by both isolates, with relatively few differences in the number of family members across the strains. there were  <dig> families in which there was at least a three-fold expansion in one species versus the other . for example, c. sublineola appeared to be enriched in some ssm domains, and in one family of phosphotransferase enzymes, in comparison with c. graminicola. there were  <dig> pfam families that were found only in c. graminicola, while  <dig> were found only in c. sublineola . nearly all of these non-conserved families contained only a single protein, and relatively few  included members that have been previously implicated in pathogenicity, based on comparisons to the pathogen-host interactions database , which catalogs pathogenicity-associated genes that have been identified in a variety of pathogenic microbes  <cit>  .

the c. graminicola and c. sublineola annotations each include more than  <dig> predicted proteins that are not shared between the two species
ortho-mcl  <cit>  was used initially to identify putative orthologous  proteins from c. graminicola and c. sublineola. results indicated that c. graminicola and c. sublineola shared more than 90% of their proteins . they shared fewer proteins with their more distant relative c. higginsianum, but all three species still had more than 85% of their proteins in common .table  <dig> summarized data of ortho-mcl and rbh analysis of predicted proteins from c. graminicola and c. sublineola


c. graminicola
c. sublineola



approximately 9% of c. graminicola predicted proteins, and 16% of c. sublineola predicted proteins, were not assigned to ortholog groups by ortho-mcl . thus, the reciprocal blast hits  approach  <cit>  was also used to identify putative orthologous proteins. with this approach, all proteins could be accounted for. for more than 90% of the proteins, rbh gave the same result as ortho-mcl . because the rbh included all of the predicted proteins, these results were used for subsequent analyses. the results indicated that the c. graminicola annotation included  <dig> proteins that were not found in c. sublineola , while the cgsl <dig> annotation included  <dig> proteins that were not shared with m <dig>  . these proteins will hereafter be referred to as non-conserved proteins . almost one third of the m <dig>  ncps, and 17% of the cgsl <dig> ncps, were shared with the more distantly-related c. higginsianum, suggesting a role for loss as well as gain of genes in the evolutionary history of these species .

mapping of the genes encoding ncps of c. graminicola to the c. sublineola genome assembly, and vice versa, revealed that between one third and one half of them  matched sequences in the other genome assembly . these sequences might represent homologs that were not annotated due to assembly fragmentation or to differences in the gene-calling parameters of the two annotation programs. they could also represent mutant alleles  that were not recognized as orfs. more detailed studies will be necessary to determine which of these possibilities applies to each sequence.

characteristics of the c. graminicola and c. sublineola ncps
the predicted proteins that were not shared between the two colletotrichum species were relatively small, with an average size of less than  <dig> aa, compared with an average of more than  <dig> aa for all proteins . a majority in each case  were not classified by ortho-mcl . transcript data for c. sublineola are not available, but 50% of the ncps of c. graminicola were supported by transcript evidence in planta   <cit> . this could indicate that the rest of the predicted c. graminicola ncp genes are not really genes. it could also mean that ncp genes tend to be expressed at especially low levels, or under very specific circumstances that were not achieved in our in planta transcriptome analysis. further studies will be necessary to address these different possibilities.

about half of the ncps in both c. graminicola and c. sublineola were predicted to localize to either mitochondria or nuclei . only about 15% in each species were predicted to be secreted, and another 10% were predicted to localize to the plasma membrane.table  <dig> numbers of non-conserved proteins of c. graminicola and c. sublineola that are predicted to localize to various locations

the high number of predicted nuclear proteins among the ncps may suggest that there have been shifts in the regulation of gene expression in these two species that have had important impacts on host specificity. some of these ncps may also specifically target the host nucleus: for example, one of the predicted nuclear proteins in c. graminicola was glrg_ <dig>  aka. cgep <dig>  recently characterized as an essential c. graminicola effector that is targeted to the plant nucleus, with both a secretion signal and a nuclear localization signal   <cit>  . in our study, neither signalp nor wolf psort indicated the presence of a signal peptide in this protein. a second candidate nuclear effector identified in  <cit> , glrg_ <dig>  was similarly not predicted to have a signal peptide in our study. a third putative nls effector from that study  was on our list of ncps as a predicted ssp, but not as a nuclear protein. these differences in predicted locations probably relate to differences in the localization prediction protocols that we used. this illustrates why localization predictions should be experimentally confirmed. the rest of the nls effectors identified in  <cit>  are conserved in cgsl <dig>  and thus they were not among the ncps.

approximately a quarter of the ncps in each species were predicted to be localized in the mitochondria . mitochondrial proteins have been implicated in several important animal disease mechanisms . in animal cells, some transcription factors and receptors are known to translocate to the mitochondria in response to extracellular signals, where they promote cell death or cell survival  <cit> . the high number of predicted mitochondrial proteins among the colletotrichum ncp may point to an important role for mitochondrial functions in host adaptation and specificity in these two species. however, the locations of these proteins in the mitochondria should be confirmed by more direct methods before drawing any definitive conclusions.

the ncps were further evaluated by blastx against the ncbi nr database, and also against the predicted proteomes of the c. sublineola epitype strain, and of five other closely related species of colletotrichum isolated from gramineaceous hosts  <cit> . the latter can be accessed from the joint genome institute  genome portal . based on this analysis, about 20%  of the ncps in c. graminicola, and about 25%  of the c. sublineola ncps, appeared to be lineage-specific . although the number of ls genes may decrease as new fungal genomes are added to the databases, the lack of homologs in the five closely related species should make this less likely.

a majority  of the ncps in both strains did not match any pfam categories . about 10% of these non-classified ncps in each case were putative ssps. among the minority of ncps with pfam classifications, the largest groups consisted of transporters; cytochrome p450s; ssm-associated proteins; carbohydrate-active enzymes ; and transcription factors . there was also a large group of proteins in each case categorized as heterokaryon incompatibility factors, and a number of other proteins that could potentially be involved in signaling , and pathogenicity, e.g. proteins with lysm chitin-binding domains  <cit> ; necrosis-inducing npp domains  <cit> ; nudix domains  <cit> ; and common in fungal extracellular membrane  domains  <cit> . seventeen percent of the c. sublineola ncps, and 20% of the c. graminicola ncps, matched entries in the phi database. the ncps for each species were comprised of similar classes, but the cgsl <dig> annotation generally included more members of each class than the m <dig>  annotation, accounting for the larger number of ncps predicted overall in the c. sublineola strain .table  <dig> numbers of non-conserved proteins in c. graminicola and c. sublineola in various categories

c. sublineola



transporters represented a major category of the ncps with pfam designations, and included members of several different superfamilies . the largest group belonged to the major facilitator superfamily . mfs transporters are the most common category of secondary carrier proteins. members of this group are involved in the uptake of essential minerals and nutrients, also serving in many cases as nutrient sensors  <cit> . many of the other overrepresented categories of mfs transporters function in the transport of various drugs and toxins  <cit> , and include members that are homologs of known toxin-associated genes in other fungi . another well-represented group of ncp transporters, the atp-binding cassette  superfamily, are also known to have important functions in the transport of toxic substances  <cit> . the relative abundance of these two categories among the ncps suggests an important role for detoxification and/or production of toxic ssms in host-species adaptation. the additional presence of ssm-associated proteins and cytochrome p450s as highly represented ncps reinforces this conclusion. in addition to mfs, several other categories of ncp transporters are known to be involved in sensing of nutritional and other environmental factors. for example, the largest single category of ncp transporters was the ankyrin-b class, which functions to link the cytoskeleton to a variety of membrane proteins, some of which may act as receptors for plant signals  <cit> . the prominence of these classes among the ncp receptors suggests a necessity for adaptive changes in the sensory receptors of the pathogens to variations in the signals provided by each host plant.

transcription factors  were another conspicuous category among the ncps. both species encoded non-conserved  tfs belonging to two pfam categories: pf <dig> -cys binuclear cluster domain); and pf <dig> . a little over one third of the nc tfs were predicted to localize to mitochondria, and most of the rest to the nuclei. in c. graminicola, one of the predicted nuclear nc tfs was related to dep <dig>  which is part of the depudecin pks gene cluster in alternaria brassicicola. when dep <dig> was knocked out it resulted in a small reduction in virulence on cabbage  <cit> . this tf gene in c. graminicola is part of a pks ssm gene cluster  that produces an unknown product. nc tfs in c. sublineola included two additional types, a bzip transcription factor , and two nuclear pf <dig> proteins. nearly all of these also had hits in the phi database. one of the pf <dig> proteins in c. sublineola was related to the ctb <dig> regulator of cercosporin biosynthesis in cercospora nicotianae, which is part of the cercosporin gene cluster. a knock out of that gene resulted in an inability to produce cercosporin and a reduction in virulence  <cit> . there is a second ortholog of ctb <dig> in c. sublineola that is shared with c. graminicola. in c. graminicola, that gene is part of a pks cluster   <cit> . however, c. sublineola doesn’t appear to share cluster  <dig>  and the c. sublineola-specific ortholog of ctb <dig> was a part of a pks cluster , which is not conserved in c. graminicola .

a third prominent category of ncps were cazymes . specific enzyme categories that were over-represented included pectinases, ligninases, and lignocellulases. wall structures of maize and sorghum do not appear to differ very much  <cit> , so it is possible that some of these enzymes are targeted by plant defense mechanisms, which has driven their diversification  <cit> . similar categories of cazymes were also evolving rapidly among a larger group of more distantly related genera of colletotrichum fungi  <cit> .

identification of ssm-associated genes in c. sublineola strain cgsl1
the program ortho-mcl and the refiner coco-cl were used to identify genes in c. sublineola that were orthologous to the previously identified ssm-associated genes of c. graminicola and c. higginsianum  <cit> . using this approach, combined with manual annotation,  <dig> pks genes, eight nrps genes, six pks-nrps hybrid genes,  <dig> ts genes, and eight dmat genes, were identified in c. sublineola . pfam analysis of the c. sublineola protein predictions identified  <dig> putative ssm domains. all of the ssm-associated genes that were identified by ortho-mcl and coco-cl  were included among the ssm genes identified after manual annotation of the pfam domains. however, the pfam analysis identified additional genes in some classes  encoded by c. sublineola that were not found in either c. graminicola or c. higginsianum .table  <dig> ortho-mcl prediction of shared secondary metabolism-associated genes for the three species of colletotrichum

phylogenetic analysis of the ssm-associated proteins
a phylogenetic analysis was performed to address the relationships among the putative ssm-associated proteins in c. graminicola and c. sublineola. the more distantly-related species c. higginsianum was also included for comparison. ssm-associated genes in c. graminicola and c. higginsianum were previously published  <cit> . after manual annotation and identification of overlapping gene models, the  <dig> pks genes that were previously identified in c. higginsianum  <cit>  were reduced to  <dig> complete genes for analysis . the adenylation domain  of nrps proteins and pks-nrps hybrids  <cit> , the keto-synthase  n-terminal and c-terminal domains of pks proteins and pks-nrps hybrids  <cit> , and the entire dmat and ts protein sequences, were used for the phylogenetic analyses.

results of the analysis revealed a high degree of diversity, with relatively few ssm-associated protein ortholog families that were conserved across all three colletotrichum species . as expected, c. graminicola and c. sublineola shared more ortholog families than either shared with c. higginsianum, consistent with a more recent common ancestor. the presence of some ortholog families only in c. higginsianum and c. graminicola, or only in c. higginsianum and c. sublineola, suggested that some members of these families may have been lost since the divergence of c. higginsianum from the other two species. the pks proteins were the largest and most diverse group of ssm-associated proteins, with  <dig> proteins or protein ortholog families across the three species. the nrps proteins comprised the smallest group, with only  <dig> different proteins or ortholog families. colletotrichum graminicola and c. sublineola shared about half of their pks proteins, and also about half of their pks-nrps hybrid and ts proteins. the dmat and nrps proteins were more highly conserved, with about two thirds represented in both species. searches of the ncbi nr database, and of the predicted proteomes of five close relatives in the jgi database, revealed that there were no ssm-associated protein genes in either c. sublineola or in c. graminicola that were unique to either species .fig.  <dig>

conservation of gene clusters
gene clusters in c. sublineola were identified by manual analysis of the genes located on either side of the “backbone” ssm-associated genes  that had been identified by using ortho-mcl/coco-cl and pfam. a total of  <dig> putative ssm-associated gene clusters in the c. sublineola genome , were compared with the  <dig> clusters that were previously identified from c. graminicola  <cit> . there were  <dig> pks gene clusters that appeared to be shared  between c. sublineola and c. graminicola. one of these is the melanin cluster   <cit> , and another is likely to be responsible for the production of monorden because it is identical in gene structure and content with the rads cluster of pochonia chlamydospora   <cit> . colletotrichum sublineola and c. graminicola also shared five dmat clusters, five nrps gene clusters, and thirteen ts gene clusters . one of these conserved ts clusters is probably involved in the production of carotenoids  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the organization of the conserved melanin gene clusters from c. sublineola, c. graminicola and c. orbiculare are shown, with orthologous genes depicted in the same color. the predicted genes shown in gray encode hypothetical proteins. microsynteny among the clusters is indicated by the gray bars

colletotrichum graminicola and c. sublineola each encode unique putative secreted proteins and ssps
identification of ssp genes in c. sublineola and c. graminicola
the primary characteristic for bioinformatic identification of an effector protein is that it includes an n-terminal sequence that targets it for processing and secretion. about 14% of the predicted proteins in c. graminicola and in c. sublineola had canonical signal peptides. secreted effector proteins are usually described as small, but various sources have defined “small” differently, ranging from <  <dig> amino acids  <cit>  to <  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . we chose a cutoff of  <dig> amino acids for our definition of ssps. colletotrichum graminicola is predicted to encode  <dig> small secreted proteins  of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in size, with or without predicted functional domains. the number for c. sublineola is  <dig>  the level of amino acid similarity of homologous secreted proteins is less than that of non-secreted proteins . if only ssps are considered, versus all secreted proteins, the level of similarity is even lower .fig.  <dig> percent similiarity among proteins that are predicted to be secreted, versus among all predicted proteins, in c. graminicola and c. sublineola






colletotrichum graminicola and c. sublineola have more ssps in common than either share with their more distant relative c. higginsianum . colletotrichum graminicola m <dig>  encodes  <dig> predicted ssps that are not found in c. sublineola strain cgsl <dig>  while c. sublineola has  <dig> that are not shared with c. graminicola . the majority of these nc ssps from both species  were similar to predicted proteins in other fungi in the ncbi database, although in most cases these were classified as hypothetical proteins . the remainder in each case did not match predicted protein sequences from any other species in the ncbi nr database. analysis with the effectorp prediction tool  <cit>  revealed that about 60% of the nc ssps in each species had a probability of at least 50% of being fungal effectors . after additional comparisons with the available genome data from a group of five close relatives of c. graminicola and c. sublineola , there appeared to be only  <dig> c. graminicola ls-ssps, and  <dig> c. sublineola ls-ssps . interestingly, c. sublineola shares more ssps with c. eremochloae than it does with any of the other close relatives included in the jgi database. colletotrichum eremochloae is a pathogen of centipedegrass, and it was previously shown to be very closely related to c. sublineola  <cit> .fig.  <dig> venn diagrams summarizing conservation of predicted small-secreted proteins among c. graminicola, c. sublineola, and c. higginsianum. shared proteins were identified by the reciprocal best hit  method

analysis of c. graminicola in planta transcriptome data  <cit>  revealed that a majority of the transcribed c. graminicola nc ssp genes were more highly expressed in the early stages of infection , whereas less than half of the genes shared with c. sublineola and/or with c. higginsianum were expressed during these early stages .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of ssp-encoding genes that matched transcripts from the in planta c. graminicola transcriptome  <cit> 




characterized effector classes among nc ssps
several classes of fungal effectors described in the literature from other organisms are included among the nc ssps of c. graminicola and c. sublineola.

the cfem proteins have an eight cysteine-containing domain of around  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . some cfem proteins have important roles in pathogenesis  <cit> . there are  <dig> cfem ssps in c. graminicola m <dig> , and c. sublineola cgsl <dig> has homologs for  <dig> of these . the c. sublineola epitype strain s <dig>  has a homolog for the eleventh .

effectors with chitin-binding domains  <cit>  are thought to bind to chitin present in fungal cell walls, thus protecting the pathogen from plant chitinases  <cit> . colletotrichum graminicola and c. sublineola share two ssp genes that encode chitin binding domains . colletotrichum graminicola encodes one additional nc chitin-binding ssp .

genes containing lysin motifs  are conserved in pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungi  <cit> . they appear to be highly divergent among species, and thus to be evolving rapidly  <cit> . lysm effectors, eg. ecp <dig> from cladosporium fulvum, are believed to sequester fungal chitin fragments, thus preventing host detection . in c. lindemuthianum, a lysm protein called clh <dig> was localized specifically to the surface of biotrophic hyphae by using a monoclonal antibody  <cit> . there are two predicted lysm-domain ssp genes in c. graminicola, one of which is a homolog of clh <dig>  both of these are expressed during the early stages of fungal colonization in the wt strain . colletotrichum sublineola has four predicted lysm-domain ssp genes. two of these are shared with c. graminicola, including a homolog of c1h <dig> 

there are five predicted c. graminicola proteins, and nine in c. sublineola, that belong to the conserved nep1-like protein  family  <cit> , which also includes the npp <dig> family of phytophthora effectors  <cit> . this family induces apoptosis in host plant tissues, and members are believed to play roles in the induction of necrotrophy . four nlps are conserved in the two colletotrichum species, and also have homologs in c. higginsianum  <cit> . in c. higginsianum, two of five nlps  lacked crucial amino acids and were not able to induce necrosis in n. benthamiana  <cit> . there are two putative c. sublineola homologs of chnlp <dig> and three of chnlp <dig>  but c. graminicola has only a single homolog for each of these proteins. two additional ssps containing npp <dig> domains in c. sublineola are not conserved in c. graminicola .

only  <dig> c. graminicola nc ssps, and  <dig> c. sublineola nc ssps, matched pfam categories. the vast majority  did not have pfam classifications, and this group included all of the ls-ssp proteins.

ssp families
the existence of gene families was explored by using blastp to identify potential orthologs and paralogs among the ssps from c. graminicola and c. sublineola. the  <dig> ssps from the two species could be grouped into  <dig> families of related sequences . most of the  <dig> conserved families that included members from both species were comprised of only one member in c. graminicola and one in c. sublineola. about 1/ <dig> of the conserved families consisted of more than one putative paralog in one or both species. the largest conserved family included  <dig> predicted glycosyl hydrolase genes;  <dig> paralogs in c. graminicola, and  <dig> in c. sublineola.


c. graminicola had  <dig> nc ssp gene families that were not found in c. sublineola, and c. sublineola had  <dig> that were not found in c. graminicola . among these nc families, nine included two paralogs, while the rest were each represented by only a single member. none of the nc families included more than two members. these results suggest that there has been relatively little duplication of ssp proteins within these two species.

ssp and ssm diversity among isolates
we sequenced the genome of a second strain of c. graminicola, m <dig> , which was isolated from maize with anthracnose symptoms in the late 1980s in brazil. this strain is sexually compatible with m <dig>   <cit> . assembly and annotation statistics are included in table  <dig>  and predicted protein sequences are provided in additional file  <dig>  only  <dig> out of the 12006 m <dig>  predicted gene sequences  had no match in the m <dig>  assembly . only five of those genes were predicted to encode ssps, while one was a putative ssm-associated gene. of the  <dig> predicted m <dig>  strain-specific genes, only seven had no matches to any other sequences in the ncbi nr database or the jgi databases . none of these seven had pfam descriptions, and none were predicted to encode ssps or ssm-associated proteins. there was transcript evidence for only one of them . the apparent low number of strain-specific ssps in c. graminicola is consistent with an earlier report  <cit>  that suggested that differences in expression may be more important than presence-absence polymorphisms for pathotype identity.

two other genome assemblies are available for c. sublineola. the tx430bb strain was isolated in texas in the late 1980s, and was sequenced by baroncelli et al.  <cit> . the s <dig>  strain is the epitype for the species  <cit> , and its genome assembly can be accessed from jgi . this strain was isolated in the late 1980s in burkina faso  <cit> .


c. sublineola isolate cgsl <dig> has  <dig> predicted gene sequences , including  <dig> ssp genes, that are not found in the tx430bb assembly . it has  <dig> gene sequences  that are not found in s <dig> , only  <dig> of which encode ssps. only  <dig> gene sequences are not found in either of the other two other strains, including  <dig> ssps. all of the ssm-associated genes in cgsl <dig> appear to have matches in both other strains of c. sublineola. of the  <dig> cgsl <dig> strain-specific genes, only four had no matches to any other sequences in the ncbi nr database or the jgi databases . none of these genes encodes an ssp, and only one has a pfam domain .

the apparent rarity of strain-specific ssp gene sequences differs from some other fungal species, eg. magnaporthe oryzae, where the deletion of secreted effector genes seems to be common, and to play an important role in the evolution of new races  <cit> . however, comparisons with genome assemblies of the five closely related species within the graminicolous clade, accessed from jgi , suggests a more important role for deletion of effector genes, as well as other classes of genes, in speciation and host species adaptation, a finding that has also been reported by others based on comparative analyses of a wider range of colletotrichum genera  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have compared gene models from two contemporaneous, co-occurring strains of the sibling species c. graminicola and c. sublineola, and identified those that do not appear to be conserved as potential candidates for involvement in host specificity. our approach was based on previous studies that have shown that gene gain and loss is associated with host range in many plant pathogens, including colletotrichum  <cit> . however, we do not mean to suggest that products of conserved genes don’t also play important roles, either alone or in combination with non-conserved gene products, in host specialization. the list of non-conserved genes identified in this work is a function of how we defined them, including the level of similarity that we considered significant, and the ability to accurately assign orthologs.

our analysis confirmed that the genomes of the c. graminicola and c. sublineola strains were very similar to one another in both gene content and gene order, consistent with a relatively recent common ancestor. we also confirmed that each strain was able to successfully colonize its own living host , while the closely related non-host underwent an apparent hypersensitive response upon challenge. after applying our chosen parameters, we found that 14% of the c. graminicola gene models, and 22% of the c. sublineola gene models, were not conserved in the other species. certain categories of genes were especially likely to be non-conserved including, as expected, genes that were predicted to encode ssps and ssm-associated proteins that may play important roles in early events related to host recognition and the induction of compatibility. a relatively small number of the nc ssp gene sequences were also not conserved among different strains within each species, especially c. sublineola, which suggested the possibility of selection within the population and a potential avr function. races of both c. sublineola and c. graminicola have been reported to occur .

the majority of ncps were not ssps or ssm-associated proteins. transporters, cytochrome p450s, and signaling proteins were well-represented, suggesting an important role for these functions in adaptation to varying aspects of each host environment, and in the secretion or evasion of toxic secondary metabolites. transcription factors were also particularly abundant, suggesting that changes in gene expression patterns may be more important than the presence/absence of individual genes. transcriptome and proteome comparisons would help us to address this hypothesis. cazymes were another common category, in spite of similarity of cell wall structure in maize and sorghum. it is known that some plant defenses target some cazymes in the apoplast  <cit>  so it may be that these cazymes have diversified as a result of selection against host specific defenses. a relatively large number of the ncps in both species were not categorized by either ortho-mcl or pfam. many of these genes appeared to be conserved in other fungi, where they are predicted to encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function. many are predicted to be secreted, or targeted to the nucleus or the mitochondria, and may interact with specific host factors to suppress or avoid host defenses, or to establish biotrophic hyphae or nutritional access. similar categories of proteins were found to be rapidly evolving among several more distantly related colletotrichum genera, suggesting that these categories play important roles in niche adaptation across the entire genus  <cit> .

our findings indicate that host specificity in these closely related pathosystems is not only a matter of recognition of, and response to, particular pathogenicity factors at the point of attempted penetration. differences in fungal gene content reflect a much broader adaptation to the living host environment across the entire course of pathogen development, which has presumably developed during co-evolution of the host and its pathogen.

we found that the quality of the available assemblies and annotations had an important impact on our findings. we compared the published broad annotation of c. graminicola with our maker annotation of c. sublineola. according to these data, c. sublineola had more genes than c. graminicola. as an exercise, we re-annotated c. graminicola with maker, and  <dig>  genes were predicted,  <dig>  more than maker predicted for c. sublineola. comparison of the two annotations of c. graminicola  using blastp revealed that they had about  <dig>  genes in common, while the rest of the gene models were specific to each annotation . some of the genes that were found in only one annotation were predicted to encode ssps or ssm-associated proteins . we conclude from this exercise that the total number of potential ssp and ssm-associated genes we have reported here for c. graminicola and c. sublineola might be under-estimated, while the numbers of unique ssps and ssm-associated proteins could be somewhat inflated. when we mapped the potential unique genes from each species against the genome assemblies of the other, between  <dig> and 70% of these genes did not hit the assembly of the other strain at all, and thus do appear to be truly non-conserved sequences. among the apparently nc genes that did have hits to the assembly, our preliminary investigations suggest that many were not annotated due to fragmentation, which may be related to the different assembly qualities. the c. graminicola assembly, which was produced by using a combination of sanger and  <dig> sequencing, includes fewer contigs and scaffolds than the c. sublineola assembly, which was done by using  <dig> alone. this fragmentation effect is expected to become progressively more significant as methods providing shorter reads  are increasingly used for genome sequencing in fungi. although it has not been widely acknowledged in previous comparative studies, it is clear that the use of datasets from diverse sources that have been developed by using different assembly and annotation programs and program parameters will have an impact on the results. because of this, we emphasize the importance of confirming these data with other methods , before proceeding with any additional studies focused on individual genes.

this work has provided important clues to functions  that are important in the determination of host preference among these two closely related and economically important pathogens. the data included here will provide a useful foundation for further studies to explore the basis for non-host recognition, with the goal of using this information to develop improved varieties of maize and sorghum for management of anthracnose diseases.
