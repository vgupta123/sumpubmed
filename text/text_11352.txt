BACKGROUND
faba bean  is an important food and fodder crop worldwide and a staple in middle east, central and east asia and north africa. in terms of cultivation area, faba bean ranks fourth among the cool-season food legumes  after chickpea, pea and lentil . its agricultural role is currently increasing as the crop is receiving a renovated interest in european countries, north america and australia.

faba bean is a diploid legume crop  with facultative cross-pollination and has one of the largest described genomes among legumes. the genome size is ~ <dig>  mb, more than  <dig> times larger than that of the model medicago truncatula, and contains more than 85% of repetitive dna  <cit> . the large chromosome size has allowed faba bean to become one of the cytogenetically best characterised plant species. however, it has also difficulted the development of saturated linkage maps and the identification of relevant genes/qtls . moreover, it precludes whole-genome shotgun assembly with next generation sequencing technologies.

genetic linkage maps are essential tools for a wide range of genetic and breeding applications, including the study of inheritance of qualitative and quantitative traits and the identification of markers linked to relevant agronomic traits. the availability of high-density maps enhances the breeding process through the application of association analyses, map-based cloning or marker-assisted approaches. table  <dig> presents a summary of the faba bean linkage maps reported so far.

studies carried out by the ifapa group and considered in this study in bold.

prior to  <dig>  only a few morphological and isozyme loci were mapped in the v. faba genome and no extended linkage groups  had been reported. primary trisomics and translocation stocks allowed the first assignment of genes and lgs to specific chromosomes  <cit> . this approach was further explored to develop physically localized markers and microsatellites  from specific chromosomic regions  <cit> . this led to the integration of the first genetic and physical maps and allowed the unambiguous assignation of lgs to their respective chromosomes.

preliminary maps constructed with f <dig> populations were mostly based on dominant markers such as rapds together with morphological, isozyme, seed storage protein genes and microsatellites, which saturated different areas of the genome  <cit> . first attempts to map genes/qtls for seed weight  <cit>  and resistance to a parasitic plant  and fungal diseases  were reported  <cit> . using a f <dig> population from the cross vf <dig> × vf <dig>  a linkage map was developed to locate qtls controlling crenate broomrape   <cit>  and a. fabae resistance  <cit> . nine of the  <dig> lgs reported could be assigned to specific chromosomes thanks to markers that were common with those of previous studies. subsequently, a linkage map of an f <dig> population from the cross 29h × vf <dig>  segregating for resistance to the two pathogens, was constructed in which  <dig> of the  <dig> lgs were assigned to chromosomes  <cit> .

these faba bean maps did not allow wider mapping comparisons, since they mostly shared dominant and anonymous markers such as rapds, with scarce transferrability between genotypes and legume species. despite this limitation, marker data of  <dig> f <dig> populations , all sharing the common female parent vf <dig>  were used to construct a composite linkage map  <cit> . after joint segregation analysis of  <dig> markers in  <dig> individuals,  <dig> markers were included in  <dig> major lgs, of which  <dig> were unambiguously assigned to specific chromosomes . this composite map covered  <dig>  cm and was one of the most comprehensive faba bean genetic map published to date  <cit> .

these maps with dominant markers in f <dig> were followed by more precise maps constructed in the corresponding ril populations, using co-dominant markers. in addition to microsatellites, expressed sequence tags  from other legume species emerged as efficient tools in faba bean. a large number of intron-targeted primer pairs , developed within the grain legumes integrated project-glip , was tested and mapped in two faba bean inbred populations . these were used to validate qtls underlying broomrape and ascochyta resistance in different environments and genetic backgrounds  <cit> . a third ril population derived from cross vf6 × vf <dig> was used to construct the first exclusively gene-based genetic map in faba bean. it contained  <dig> itaps joined in  <dig> unassigned lgs, that spanned  <dig>  cm, and allowed for the first time the study of macrosyntenic relationships between v. faba, m. truncatula, lens culinaris and other legume species  <cit> . after further saturation, the map was used to identify and validate qtls controlling flowering time and other yield-related traits  <cit> . recently, a new map was reported based on the f <dig> population from the cross 91825 × k <dig>  which includes  <dig> ssrs markers arranged in  <dig> unassigned lgs  <cit> . unfortunately the lack of common markers prevented comparisons with previous mapping studies.

to date  <dig> major genetic maps have been constructed in faba bean . integrating the information of multiple populations from diverse genetic backgrounds offers several advantages over individual genetic maps:  a larger number of loci is mapped than in single crosses,  the relative position of common markers can be determined across the mapping populations,  better genome coverage and opportunities to validate marker order,  better assignment of lgs to chromosomes,  it allows comparison of genes/qtls of interest across maps and,  it provides the basis for comparing genomes between related species  <cit> . consensus genetic maps have been developed in many crops such as wheat  <cit> , maize  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , and in the legume crops soybean  <cit> , pea  <cit> , chickpea  <cit> , phaseolus  <cit> , pigeonpea  <cit> , cowpea  <cit> , groundnut  <cit>  and red clover  <cit> .

with the development of genome sequencing projects and expression studies in different model and crop legumes, the construction of a faba bean consensus genetic map has become possible. the objectives of this study were to:  saturate the faba bean maps developed in ril progenies with common gene based markers to facilitate anchoring of linkage groups from different populations,  update the position of the most relevant faba bean qtls controlling resistance and yield related traits using bulked segregant analysis , and  construct a reference map integrating all the genomic information reported so far in this crop. to this aim, we fused information of  <dig> f <dig> populations and marker data of three ril genetic maps to derive a consensus map including  <dig> markers and covering  <dig>  cm. the six main lgs could be unambiguously assigned to their corresponding faba bean chromosomes. the map represents a significant improvement over single-population genetic maps and provides a new tool of reference for faba bean breeding and genomic approaches.

RESULTS
individual maps and qtl analysis
cross vf <dig> × vf <dig> 
the first ril <dig> map  <cit>  included  <dig> markers joined in  <dig> lgs and covering  <dig>  cm. the linkage groups were composed of 2– <dig> loci with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the map allowed to identify and validate qtls controlling  <dig> flowering and reproductive traits  <cit> : days to flowering , flowering length , pod length , number of seeds per pod  and number of ovules per pod , located mainly in chromosomes  v and vi .

for the extended ril <dig> map constructed herein,  <dig> polymophic markers were used in the global analysis . of these,  <dig> were assembled in  <dig> lgs,  <dig> of which could be assigned to specific chromosomes. the distance covered by the map was  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig> cm. sixty five of the markers are common with the other two ril populations,  <dig> with ril <dig>  only,  <dig> with ril <dig>  only and  <dig> with both .

cross vf <dig> × vf <dig> 
the previously published ril <dig> map  <cit>  was based on  <dig> marker loci assembled in  <dig> lgs  that span  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. in this population,  <dig> qtls controlling ascochyta blight resistance  were identified on chr. iii and chr. ii  <cit> . in parallel studies,  <dig> qtls  controlling o. foetida resistance and 4r qtls controlling o. crenata resistance  were detected  <cit> . oc <dig> and oc <dig> were stable in at least two of the three environments, while oc <dig> and oc <dig> were only detected in one environment and thus appeared to be environment-dependent.

in an attempt to saturate the regions bearing the o. crenata and a. fabae qtls, a bsa approach based on rapd markers was applied. two-hundred and eight of the  <dig> rapd primers assayed in the cross revealed promising polymorphisms between at least one pair of bulks and were subsequently used to screen  <dig> plants individually. only  <dig> of the rapd primers maintained the expected pattern of polymorphism and were used to screen the entire ril <dig> population, resolving  <dig> scorable polymorphic markers. of these,  <dig> markers exhibited the expected segregation pattern and were thus included in the ril data set for mapping and qtl analysis. thirty of the  <dig> rapd markers were mapped,  <dig> to target regions  and  <dig> to other lgs . to increase the number of common markers between different faba bean crosses, additional itap markers were scored and the map was reconstructed using  <dig> segregating loci.

*linkage groups correspond to those of the composite map.

**markers mapped in addition to already published linkage map  <cit> : first number represents the number of markers added by saturation mapping targeted at the regions conferring resistance to o. crenata and ascochyta fabae , while the second is the number of markers added to increase the number of common markers among different faba bean crosses.

the map obtained in this study consists of  <dig> mapped loci assembled into  <dig> lgs, of which  <dig> were assigned to specific chromosomes. the genome distance covered by the map is  <dig>  cm, with an average density of one marker locus every  <dig>  cm . fifty four markers included in ril <dig> are common with the other two populations,  <dig> with ril <dig> only,  <dig> with ril <dig> only and  <dig> with both .

as mentioned above, qtls oc <dig> and oc <dig>  that confer broomrape resistance, were previously validated in  <dig> of the  <dig> field trials assayed  <cit> . by saturating the target regions we were able to identify significant qtls in each trial. thus, the conservation of qtls both across generations and environments was confirmed. in case of oc <dig>  a newly added marker, opag <dig>  was the closest to lod peak value in both córdoba  <dig> and córdoba  <dig> datasets. three additional qtls were identified in chr. ii  and v . none of these qtls was stable in the different field assays or years, pointing towards an environment-dependent expression. in the case of ascochyta blight resistance, the analysis which was based on a more saturated map yielded higher lod scores and narrower confidence intervals for both qtls . the new marker opz <dig> was the closest to lod peak value of both af <dig> qtls identified in leaves and stems . addition of new markers in target areas of the map was an efficient method to increase the genome coverage and to obtain more defined qtls.

cross 29h × vf <dig> 
the third map used in the present study was reported recently and includes  <dig> markers spanning  <dig> cm  <cit> . the linkage groups were composed of  <dig> to  <dig> loci with a marker interval of  <dig>  cm. seven qtls for o. crenata  and  <dig> qtls for o. foetida  were identified in this map. oc <dig> was detected along three years, explaining between 22% and 33% of the phenotypic variation. it has been suggested that oc <dig>  and oc <dig>  which are both located in chr. vi and validated in different environments and genetic backgrounds, might correspond to the same qtl region . the new analysis considered  <dig> marker loci segregating in this population, of which  <dig> were common to both other ril populations,  <dig> to ril <dig> only and  <dig> to ril <dig> only .

consensus linkage map
three sets of faba bean mapping data were used in the construction of a consensus map connecting information of  <dig> f <dig> populations, marker data of  <dig> rils, as well as new markers genotyped in the present study . the number of individual marker loci ranged from  <dig> in ril <dig> to  <dig> in ril <dig> and  <dig> in ril <dig> . chi-square test was performed on new marker genotyping data for individual mapping population,s to test the null hypothesis of segregation ratios of 1: <dig>  a variable percentage of distorted markers  was observed, ranging from  <dig> % in ril <dig> to  <dig> % in ril <dig>  a list of the marker loci is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  qtl regions characterized in previous studies were also covered by the present consensus map.

the number of anchor markers for pairwise comparisons was initially small, with less than  <dig> markers in common. however, after the new marker analysis the number triplicated to  <dig> . sixty five of these, present in ril <dig>  were primarily used as bridges to integrate the individual maps into a single consensus map . twenty five markers were common in the  <dig> maps, while the remaining  <dig> were shared by at least  <dig> mapping populations. as a result, marker segregation data were assembled for a total of  <dig> marker loci,  <dig> of which were unique i.e. mapped only in one population .

a total of  <dig> marker loci were assembled into the  <dig> lgs constituting the consensus map , while  <dig> markers remained unlinked. the  <dig> major lgs contained between  <dig>  and  <dig> marker loci , and were assigned to the corresponding chromosomes. seven additional lgs  could also be assigned thanks to the presence of loci previously located in individual chromosomes. thirty one lgs consisted of 2– <dig> markers, and the remaining  <dig> lgs contained between  <dig> and  <dig> loci . the total length of the consensus genetic linkage map was  <dig>  cm, of which  <dig>  cm were covered by the  <dig> main lgs/chromosomes. the length of these major lgs ranged from  <dig> cm  to  <dig> cm . the entire consensus map had an average marker density of one marker per  <dig>  cm, which was reduced to  <dig> cm when considering only the  <dig> main lgs. the marker order of the integrated map was largely collinear with the three individual maps, although a few local inversions and marker rearrangements over short intervals were observed.

integration of qtl information
the number of qtl studies in faba bean is relatively low compared to other major legume species. most traits have been genetically characterized in only one or two different mapping experiments, which limits the meta-analysis of qtls in this species. moreover, qtl intervals did not always include the minimum of two anchor markers, which is required for their projection onto the consensus map. nevertheless, by comparing the maps published to date we provide a synthetic view of the most relevant loci controlling polygenic traits in faba bean. further mapping of common markers between maps will be crucial to enhance the comparison of qtl positions from different mapping studies and to refine the localization of hot-spot genomic regions.

the  <dig> faba bean mapping experiments in the  <dig> ril populations reported so far, identified  <dig> qtls for  <dig> traits . most of the qtl analyses focused on biotic stresses . the number of qtls for broomrape resistance is  <dig> for o. crenata and  <dig> for o. foetida. meanwhile the a. fabae resistance qtls were reduced to  <dig>  af <dig> and af <dig>  that were conserved among populations  and environments. regarding flowering and yield related traits, the number of stable qtls reported were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the distribution of these  <dig> qtls varied from  <dig> in chr. i,  <dig> in chr. ii,  <dig> in chr. iii and vi,  <dig> in chr. iv,  <dig> in chr. v. the last three qtls remained unassigned.

discussion
during the last decade, significant progress was made in the development of genotyping tools. this allowed the addition of a large number of robust and transferrable marker loci in the genetic maps of relevant crop species. in faba bean, mapping studies were initiated in the 90's with the development of the first maps in f <dig> populations using mostly rapds together with ssrs, isozymes and morphological markers. previous studies comparing these linkage maps have been reported  <cit> . the use of a recurrent parent  in all the f <dig> populations then allowed to join data from different progenies by means of common markers in the female parent. moreover, the use of trisomic families for chromosomes iii, iv, v and vi allowed allocation of lgs to chromosomes  <cit> . ever since, attempts have been made to increase marker density using new ssrs and gene-based markers in ril populations. the main objective of the present study was the development of a high density consensus genetic map that integrates all the relevant maps reported so far and serves as a reference map for the international faba bean community.

building a consensus map is not possible without common or bridge loci on each lg or chromosome. for this reason, a number of additional markers was genotyped in each mapping population to increase the number of common markers among them. a bridge marker was considered as such when its name and position were the same in the different mapping populations. the genetic map was created combining two approaches:  increasing the number of anchor marker loci in the different populations,  merging the resulting genetic maps through markers common to three ril populations with mergemap  <cit>  as reported in many other crop species  <cit> .

using this approach, segregation data for  <dig> marker were assembled on  <dig> lgs. in terms of marker order, the consensus map contains few changes compared to the individual maps. small discrepancies in the marker order or position in some lgs might be due to  different population sizes used,  weak linkages existing in the different maps, or  missing or poor quality data, rather than to real chromosome rearrangements. as reported in previous studies in vitis vinifera l.  <cit> , phaseolus  <cit>  or brassica napus  <cit> , the faba bean consensus marker order is significantly more reliable than that of the individual maps because of the higher number of individuals and recombination events occuring across three or more populations.

based on previous lg/marker allocations,  <dig> of the larger lgs could be assigned to specific chromosomes while  <dig> lgs remained unassigned. considering the enormous size of the faba bean genome, unassigned lgs may be due to recombination gaps at the distal ends of the main lgs because of a lack of marker loci. none of the main lgs differed considerably in marker density. the length of our core map was  <dig>  cm, which is higher than the single ril maps. in many other species the increased size of the composite map was attributed to an improved coverage of the chromosome ends  <cit> .

all the individual maps reported to date allocate lgs to  <dig> of the  <dig> faba bean chromosomes, excluding chr. iv. after acknowledging the erroneous assignment of lg i.b, which actually corresponds to chr. iv  <cit> , the new integrated map anchors for the first time the main lgs to the whole chromosome complement of the species. this information was used here to update the reported large-scale synteny between lgs and/or chromosomes of m. truncatula and cool season grain legumes such as pea, chickpea, lens and faba bean  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the main syntenic blocks and rearrangements among these species and their correspondence to the six faba bean chromosomes.

the integration of a high number of coding regions in the consensus map provides an excellent framework for downstream analyses, including comparisons between the locations of major genes for important traits or qtl positions between populations from different crosses. moreover, combining syntenic studies with a consensus map will contribute to increase marker density in genomic regions of interest for indirect selection or for map based cloning  <cit> . successful application of consensus maps for synteny based candidate gene identification and/or definition of qtl location has been extensively used both in cereals  <cit>  and in legumes  <cit> .

the ril mapping populations considered in the consensus map were used previously for detecting qtls of agronomically important traits. these are displayed in figure  <dig>  together with the qtls identified in the improved vf6 × vf <dig> map and detected in the present study. in order to increase the density of loci around the otls for broomrape and ascochyta blight resistance, we used bsa in contrasted dna pools. the bsa approach has been applied in numerous studies and provides a platform for high-resolution genetic analysis  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> of  <dig> rapd markers were mapped to the major linkage groups and allowed more accurate determination of qtl locations and effects. these results highlight the usefulness of bsa based on markers flanking qtls, as an efficient tool for saturation of targeted regions, opening the possibility of future marker-assisted selection for these traits.

faba bean has been considered a “genomic orphan” crop with a huge and complex genome and limited availability of genetic and genomic resources. at present, the situation has greatly improved thanks to the technological advances in high-throughput sequencing and genotyping, together with the access to genomic and transcriptomic tools. genome-wide transcription profiling by deepsupersage was recently used for quantifying the transcriptional changes elicited by a. fabae and to identify candidate resistance genes governing faba bean responses to this fungal pathogen  <cit> . several genome libraries have been constructed and characterized for putative ssr sequences using the roche  <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing platform  <cit> . these transcriptomic studies provide a foundation for the identification of novel regulators associated with faba bean-pathogen interactions and also a valuable source of markers for molecular breeding applications in this crop.

translation of genomic resources from the model species m. truncatula or other sequenced related legume species such as chickpea, should be further exploited to raise the prospects in molecular faba bean breeding programs. the availability of large sets of conserved ests from model or related species constitutes a valuable source of markers that are physically associated with coding regions. these are good candidates for gene cloning or faba bean marker assisted selection. this is the approach used in this study to integrate all the faba bean genomic information so far reported, and to generate a new tool of reference for faba bean breeding and genomics approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed the first marker consensus genetic linkage map for faba bean by integrating segregation data from three recombinant inbred line populations, together with new common markers genotyped in this study. the final integrated map has allowed to  join a larger number of markers than in any previous individual map,  obtain a more complete coverage of the faba bean genome,  fill a number of gaps in previous independent maps, and  improve the resolution of key qtls. the colinearity of the consensus map was well maintained and will serve as reference for future faba bean multiple-line cross qtl mapping studies. since 60% of the markers in the most developed map  corresponded to coding regions, this consensus enhanced-density faba bean map provides a functional framework for candidate gene studies, expression analysis, comparative genomics, evolution studies and anchoring of the future faba bean genome sequences.
