BACKGROUND
the successful colonization of new habitats requires populations to adapt to novel biotic and abiotic conditions. understanding the basis of this ecological adaptation is a major goal of evolutionary genetics. because of its demographic history, the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster offers an opportunity to address this fundamental issue in a well-established model system. presently, d. melanogaster has a worldwide distribution spanning a wide variety of habitats. however, biogeographic and population genetic studies indicate that the species has its origin in sub-saharan africa and only began to colonize non-african regions about  <dig>  years ago
 <cit> . the expansion of the species to new, non-tropical environments is thought to have been accompanied by extensive genetic adaptation
 <cit> , although the identification of ecologically adapted genes and the characterization of their functions have proven difficult. because changes in gene expression are expected to play an important role in adaptation
 <cit> , transcriptomic studies offer the possibility to bridge the gap between genotypic and phenotypic evolution and identify candidate genes that may have been the targets of regulatory adaptation. with this aim in mind, several microarray studies have been performed to identify gene expression differences between african and non-african d. melanogaster <cit> . a comparable study has been carried out in d. simulans, which has a similar demographic history to d. melanogaster <cit> .

although previous studies identified genes that differ in expression between african and european drosophila populations
 <cit> , they suffered from some limitations. for example, these studies used mrna extracted from whole flies. this approach provides a general picture of gene expression averaged over all tissues, but it is biased towards highly expressed genes and those expressed in many  tissues. the use of whole flies typically does not provide the resolution to detect expression changes that occur only in a single tissue. a second limitation to the previous population studies is that they examined flies of only one sex per experiment
 <cit> . because gene expression is highly sexually dimorphic
 <cit> , especially when using whole flies or gonads
 <cit> , expression profiles can differ greatly between males and females. consistent with this, there was very little overlap among the genes differing in expression between populations that were identified separately in males and females from whole-fly microarray studies
 <cit> , which suggests that most of the between-population expression divergence is sex-specific.

in order to get a more detailed picture of gene expression divergence between african and non-african d. melanogaster, we performed high-throughput rna sequencing  of mrna isolated from dissected brains of adult males and females from two populations, one from the ancestral species range in sub-saharan africa  and one from the derived species range in europe . we chose to study gene expression variation in the brain because it plays a critical role in processing sensorial input from the environment. the visual, olfactory, and tactile stimuli coming from biotic sources, such as predators and food resources, as well as environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, differ greatly between these populations. many of these environmental stimuli are detected by the sensorial organs of the fly’s head  and are then processed by the brain, which produces a specific output that results in a behavioral and/or physiological response. previous studies have shown that differences in gene expression in the brain can affect traits such as learning, memory, reproductive diapause, lifespan, and foraging behavior
 <cit> . furthermore, many behaviors that vary between strains or populations, including courtship, mating, aggression, and olfactory response, also exhibit sexual dimorphism
 <cit> .

the goal of this work is to identify genes that differ in their basal levels of brain gene expression between d. melanogaster strains originating from africa and europe. to this end, we use a ‘common garden’ experimental design in which flies from both populations are reared under identical laboratory conditions. this approach detects expression differences that have a genetic basis, but it cannot detect the effects of environment or gene-by-environment interactions. in total we identify  <dig> genes that differ in expression between the populations and  <dig> genes that differ in expression between the sexes. our study represents the first brain-specific comparison of gene expression between african and non-african d. melanogaster and uncovers many genes that may play a role in ecological adaptation.

RESULTS
the d. melanogaster brain transcriptome
to investigate population differences in gene expression, brains were dissected from 11– <dig> inbred lines each of an african and a european population . total rna was isolated from pooled brains within each population and used to generate cdna libraries for rna-seq. in total, we obtained over  <dig> million short sequence reads from eight cdna libraries, which included two biological replicates of each sex and population . on average, 71% of the reads could be mapped to annotated transcripts. of the remaining reads, a large proportion  mapped to ribosomal rna . because all samples were enriched for poly mrna before cdna synthesis, differences in the proportion of rrna among libraries are likely to reflect differences in mrna enrichment efficiency. most of the reads that did not map to transcripts or rrna could be mapped to intergenic regions  or introns . these may represent unannotated genes or transcript isoforms, but could also result from spurious transcription or intron retention. around 2% of all reads could not be mapped to the genome .

*includes intergenic regions, introns, transposable elements, non-coding rna , and pseudogenes.

of the  <dig>  protein-encoding genes annotated in flybase release  <dig> 
 <cit> ,  <dig>  had at least one mapped read in at least one of the libraries, while  <dig>  had at least one mapped read in every library. a total of  <dig>  genes had at least  <dig> reads when summed over all libraries , which was the minimum needed to detect significant differential expression given our experimental design and replication scheme. this set of genes was used for subsequent statistical analyses. read counts per gene were highly correlated between the biological replicates, with pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

expression differences between the sexes
we identified sex-biased genes as those whose expression showed a significant effect of sex in a two-factor analysis that accounted for both sex and population . overall, the amount of sexually dimorphic expression was low, with  <dig> genes showing a significant difference in expression between the sexes at a false discovery rate  of 5% . there was a slight tendency for genes with male-biased expression in the brain to show the same bias in whole flies . for example,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with male-biased expression in brain also had male-biased expression in whole flies
 <cit> . however, of the  <dig> other genes with male-biased expression in the brain,  <dig> had female-biased expression and eight had unbiased expression in whole flies. of the  <dig> genes with female-biased expression in the brain,  <dig> had female-biased expression,  <dig> had male-biased expression, and  <dig> had unbiased expression in whole flies .

enrichment on the x chromosome was tested by fisher’s exact test.

there was an enrichment of sex-biased genes on the x chromosome, which was significant for both male- and female-biased genes, but much stronger for male-biased genes . a previous rna-seq study using d. melanogaster heads found a similar enrichment of x-linked sex-based genes and suggested that it was related the mechanism of dosage compensation that occurs on the male x chromosome
 <cit> . to test for a possible influence of dosage compensation on sex-biased expression in the brain, we examined the correlation between the log <dig> expression ratio of all x-linked genes with at least  <dig> mapped reads in each sex and the distance to the nearest male-specific lethal  binding site
 <cit> , which represents the assembly point for the dosage compensation complex . the correlation was significantly negative , indicating that genes with relatively high expression in males tend to be close to msl binding sites. this result held when the minimum read count was increased to  <dig> or  <dig> reads per sex. when genes of the different sex-bias classes were compared, male-biased genes were found to be significantly closer to msl binding sites than female-biased or unbiased genes .

differences in d between male-biased  and unbiased genes were tested by a wilcoxon test. differences in the proportion of genes in each category were tested by fisher’s exact test. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> .

because most rna-seq reads could not be mapped unambiguously to individual transcripts of genes with alternatively spliced isoforms, we had little power to detect sexually dimorphic expression among transcript isoforms. nonetheless, we did detect significant sexual dimorphism in the expression of transformer and doublesex isoforms in the brain . we also detected transcripts of the ribosomal protein genes rpl <dig> and rps <dig> that had highly female-biased expression.

expression differences between populations
we identified genes that differed in expression between the african and european populations as those with a significant effect of population in a two-factor analysis that accounted for both population and sex . this revealed a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes at an fdr of 5% . there were  <dig> genes that showed a significant effect of both sex and population on their expression . in all of these cases, the direction of the population bias  was the same in both sexes. in general, the ratio of european-to-african expression per gene was highly correlated between males and females , indicating that there is little sex-dependent divergence in brain expression between populations. to further investigate this, we analyzed between-population expression divergence separately in females and males using a one-factor  analysis within each sex. this revealed  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between the populations in one sex, but not the other, and were not detected in the two-factor analysis. the vast majority of these genes  showed differential expression only in males, which is in contrast to the results previously reported for whole flies
 <cit> . however, even among these genes there was a strong correlation between the european-to-african expression ratios observed in males and females , which again indicates that there is little sex-dependent gene expression divergence in brain between the populations.

there were more genes that showed relative over-expression in the european population  than in the african population . this could result from the mapping of rna-seq reads to the reference genome  being more efficient for the european sample than for the african sample. to test for such a bias in mapping efficiency, we applied our read mapping procedure to simulated rna-seq reads from each population. overall, the mapping efficiency was very high with ~98% of all simulated reads from both populations being mapped to the correct gene in the reference sequence . the remaining reads either could not be mapped to the transcriptome  or were mapped to an incorrect gene . incorrect mapping occurred mostly when the exonic content of a gene showed overlap with another gene or, in rare cases, when gene families consisted of closely related paralogs. across all genes, european reads showed slightly, but not significantly, higher mapping efficiency . a similar result was observed for the subsets of genes with significant over-expression in either africa or europe . given that the observed median difference in expression of significant genes between populations was  <dig> -fold, the contribution of mapping bias to the observed expression differences is expected to be negligible.

standard deviations are given in parentheses. p-values are from wilcoxon signed-ranks tests.

at the transcript level, we were able to identify  <dig> individual transcripts of multiple-transcript genes that differed in expression between the populations at an fdr of 5% . the vast majority of these were cases where one transcript of a gene showed a significant bias towards one population and the other transcripts of that gene were either biased towards the same population or were not detected. two transcripts of the gene chkov <dig> that are associated with a polymorphic transposable element insertion
 <cit>  showed significant over-expression in europe .

validation of rna-seq results by qrt-pcr
for a subset of the genes analyzed by rna-seq, we attempted to confirm the observed expression difference between populations using rna extracted from new biological replicates and quantitative reverse-transcription pcr . the genes tested included five that were over-expressed in europe , five that were over-expressed in africa , and two that showed no difference in expression between the populations . overall, the expression ratios measured by the two methods were highly correlated . qualitatively, all of the genes gave consistent results with the two methods, with the exception of mtg, which showed high over-expression in the african population by rna-seq, but weak over-expression in the european population by qrt-pcr . the gene hsc70- <dig> showed european over-expression by both methods, however the magnitude of over-expression was much greater in the rna-seq data . otherwise, there was good agreement in the expression levels detected by rna-seq and qrt-pcr .

functional classification of differentially expressed genes
of the genes expressed differentially between the european and african populations, six are known to be involved in the response to heat stress. these include the heat shock protein hsc70- <dig>  which showed 70-fold higher expression in european flies. a role for hsc70- <dig> in ecological adaptation is supported by parallel clines in genetic variation in both australia and north america
 <cit> . another heat shock protein, hsp <dig>  showed two-fold over-expression in european flies. hsp <dig> is induced by both high and low temperatures
 <cit> , and its expression is associated with faster chill coma recovery
 <cit> , a phenotype known to differ between the african and european lines used in our analysis
 <cit> . two other genes that showed high over-expression in europe, tota  and totc , are known to be involved in general stress response and show an induction in expression under both high and low temperatures
 <cit> .

a set of genes encoding chemosensory receptors was found to differ in expression between the populations. these included ionotropic glutamate receptors , odorant-binding proteins , gustatory receptors , and olfactory receptors . the four olfactory receptors were all expressed at higher levels  in europe than in africa. or67d binds to 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate, which is a volatile male-specific pheromone known to trigger aggregation and mating behavior in both sexes as well as male-male aggressive behavior
 <cit> . or88a is activated when flies are exposed to odors from virgin or mated females, although its exact ligand has not been identified
 <cit> .

the differentially expressed genes also included six glutathione s-transferase and seven cytochrome p <dig> genes, which are known to be important for detoxification. notably, these included the cytochrome p <dig> gene cyp6g <dig>  whose over-expression is associated with resistance to ddt and related insecticides
 <cit> . previous studies of the same populations identified cyp6g <dig> as the gene with the greatest european over-expression when whole flies were examined
 <cit> . in brain, cyp6g <dig> also shows strong over-expression  in european flies.

a cluster of differentially expressed genes on chromosome arm 3r
three genes that showed significant over-expression in the african population  are located in a cluster on chromosome arm 3r. this cluster also contains the gene chkov <dig>  which is known to produce different transcript isoforms due to the presence/absence of a polymorphic doc transposable element insertion
 <cit> . all of these genes are predicted to encode choline kinases. we found that the doc element insertion, which promotes transcription of chkov <dig> isoforms that exclude the choline kinase domain, was present in all  <dig> of our european lines, but only one of the  <dig> african lines . this region of the genome shows a strong reduction in nucleotide polymorphism that is limited to the european population , which is consistent with a recent selective sweep. furthermore, there are blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium  on either side of the region of reduced polymorphism , as is expected in the case of a selective sweep
 <cit> . to further test this, we computed the statistic ω, which quantifies ld on either side of a selected site relative to ld spanning the selected site
 <cit> . high values of ω are expected following a selective sweep. the maximum value of ω in the chkov <dig> region was  <dig> . a value this high occurred in only  <dig> % of  <dig>  neutral simulations that took into account the demographic history of the european population
 <cit> , indicating that the ld pattern is unlikely to be caused by demography alone.

discussion
rna-seq analysis of dissected brains revealed over  <dig> genes that differ in expression between population samples from africa and europe. importantly, the analysis of a single tissue uncovered many differentially expressed genes that were not found in previous studies that compared gene expression in whole flies from the same populations
 <cit> . in total, the previous studies identified  <dig> genes that differed in expression between the african and european populations in either males
 <cit>  or females
 <cit> . of these, only  <dig> genes also differed significantly in brain expression between the two populations, with  <dig> showing the same direction of difference . the only gene common to all three data sets was the insecticide resistance gene, cyp6g <dig>  which always showed high over-expression  in european flies. increased expression of cyp6g <dig> is associated with an accord element insertion in its upstream region and ddt resistance
 <cit> . this insertion is present in all of our european lines, but only in half of the african lines
 <cit> . although the accord insertion upstream of cyp6g <dig> mainly affects its expression in midgut, malpighian tubule, and fat body
 <cit> , our results suggest that the accord insertion has a similar effect on cyp6g <dig> expression in the brain, where it is expressed at low levels. in contrast, the gene cg <dig>  which shows 2– <dig> times greater expression in whole flies from europe than in those from africa due to variation in a cis-regulatory sequence
 <cit> , did not differ significantly in its brain expression between the two populations. in this case, the between-population expression difference appears to be specific to the malpighian tubules, where cg <dig> shows highly enriched expression
 <cit> .

four choline kinase genes that differ in expression between the african and european populations are located in a 22-kb region of chromosome arm 3r that shows evidence for a recent selective sweep in non-african populations 
 <cit> . three of these genes  had significantly higher expression in africa than in europe. the fourth gene, chkov <dig>  did not differ in expression between populations in our gene-based analysis. however, it did differ in the transcript-based analysis. two truncated chkov <dig> transcripts that do not contain the choline kinase domain and are associated with a doc element insertion showed significant over-expression in the european population, while the full-length transcript showed strong , but not significant, over-expression in africa. this is consistent with our finding that the doc element insertion is in high frequency in europe , but low frequency in africa . taken together, these results suggest that selection has favored a reduction in the choline kinase activity of all four genes in the european population. previous work has shown that the doc element insertion in chkov <dig> is associated with increased resistance to an organophosphate pesticide
 <cit>  and to sigma virus
 <cit> . however, it is not known if the doc insertion itself was the target of selection, or if it has hitchhiked to high frequency due to linkage with another selected variant. it is also not known if the doc insertion is responsible for the expression difference of all choline kinase genes in this region, or if other regulatory changes are involved. although the doc insertion in chkov <dig> and the accord insertion upstream of cyp6g <dig> are both associated with insecticide resistance, a key difference is that the former is associated with reduced expression, while the latter is associated with increased expression. thus, resistance to organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides appears to occur through different mechanisms with respect to gene regulation.

the proportion of genes that were found to be differentially expressed in brain between the african and european populations of d. melanogaster  is similar to what has been reported for comparisons of wild and domesticated populations of fish and mammals 
 <cit> . in contrast, comparisons of brain transcriptomes between nursing and foraging bees
 <cit>  and male atlantic salmon with different mating strategies
 <cit>  revealed much higher proportions of differentially expressed genes . although the number of differently expressed genes that is detected in an experiment is highly sensitive to the experimental design, replication scheme, pooling of samples, and method of statistical analysis, these findings suggest that divergence in brain gene expression may be greater when individuals are separated into two very distinct behavioral classes.

in contrast to studies using whole flies or heads
 <cit> , we detected relatively little sexual dimorphism in brain gene expression. the difference between brains and whole flies is expected, as the vast majority of genes showing sex-biased expression in whole flies are expressed in reproductive tissues
 <cit> . in head, it appears that most sex-biased gene expression occurs outside of the brain. a previous microarray study found  <dig> sex-biased genes in the head, but only four in the central nervous system 
 <cit> . similarly, an rna-seq study identified  <dig>  sex-biased genes in the head
 <cit> , while our rna-seq analysis found only  <dig> sex-biased genes in the brain. these results suggest that nearly all of the sex-biased expression in the head occurs in non-nervous tissues such as the fat body, which is thought to play an important role in regulating sex-specific reproductive behavior and physiology
 <cit> .

despite the relatively low level of sexual dimorphism in brain gene expression, we detected a significant over-representation of sex-biased genes  on the x chromosome. previous studies of whole flies observed a paucity of male-biased genes and an excess of female-biased genes on the x chromosome
 <cit> . for male-biased genes, this pattern appears to be driven by gene expression in reproductive tissues
 <cit>  and an excess of x-linked male-biased genes in somatic tissue  has been reported
 <cit> . it has been suggested that the over-representation of somatic male-biased genes on the x chromosome is related to the mechanism of dosage compensation
 <cit> . our data are consistent with this interpretation, as we find that x-linked, male-biased genes are significantly closer to msl binding sites than female-biased or unbiased genes . this suggests that their proximity to the msl binding site leads to an “over-compensation” of expression in male somatic tissue. our results contrast with those of a previous study of sex-biased gene expression in gonadectomized flies
 <cit> , which suggested that msl binding might interfere with sex-specific regulation, leading to a reduction of male-biased expression. a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the identification of sex-biased genes in gonadectomized flies might be confounded by variation in sex-bias among tissues. in comparison to male-biased genes, female-biased genes show a weaker enrichment on the x chromosome. although there is some indication that x-linked female-biased genes tend to be located farther from msl binding sites than male-biased or unbiased genes , the sample size is too small to draw a firm conclusion. thus, the excess of x-linked, female-biased genes may not be related to dosage compensation, but instead may reflect an overall feminization of the x chromosome
 <cit> , possibly caused by sexually antagonistic selection
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
organisms may adapt to new or changing environmental conditions by altering levels of gene expression. since expression profiles can vary greatly among tissues, it is likely that some adaptive regulatory changes are tissue- or organ-specific. for example, gene expression changes occurring specifically in the brain may underlie adaptive behavioral or physiological responses to the environment. however, there are few cases where gene expression and behavioral polymorphisms have been linked in an evolutionary framework
 <cit>  and more work is needed in order to understand the relationships among selection, gene expression, and behavior/physiology. to this end, we used rna-seq to compare brain gene expression between two d. melanogaster populations from different habitats. in total, we identified  <dig> genes that differed in brain expression between the populations, the vast majority of which were not detected in analogous studies that used whole flies as the source of rna.

among the differentially expressed genes were those with functions in stress response, olfaction, and detoxification, including two genes previously implicated in insecticide resistance. brain tissue is thought to be especially sensitive to heat, cold, and oxidative stress, and also can be affected by chemical stressors, such as insecticides. for example, some insects are known to metabolize insecticides specifically in nerve ganglia
 <cit> . thus, the alteration of gene expression in the brain may be particularly important for environmental adaptation. further studies are needed to elucidate the contribution of specific gene expression changes to behavioral and physiological differences between populations and to determine the selective agents and regulatory mechanisms responsible for them.
