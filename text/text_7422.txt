BACKGROUND
insulitis is an inflammation of pancreatic langerhans islets, which is known to precede the onset of diabetes mellitus   <cit> . post-insulitis decrease of pancreatic β cells is a major hallmark of both type  <dig>  and type  <dig> diabetes mellitus   <cit> . it is associated to α cells dysfunctions and high glucagon secretion, which contribute to chronic hyperglycemia and ensuing clinical outcomes in dm  <cit> . accordingly, efforts to increase our knowledge on the biomolecular mechanisms regulating proliferation, physiopathological functions, and apoptosis of α cells will likely result in improved medical approaches to the disease. the pathways leading to mammalian β cell apoptosis, induced by proinflammatory cytokines, are complex but sufficiently known  <cit> . on the contrary, the molecular bases of α cells higher resistance than β to the same cues are still largely uncharacterized  <cit> . pancreatic α and β cells share common endocrine precursors , but upon differentiation they respond differently to external stimuli as proinflammatory cytokines, glucagon-like peptide  <dig> , and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase- <dig>   <cit> . micrornas  are small  noncoding rnas, which control gene expression mainly at the post-transcriptional level: mirnas have been shown to be master regulators of cell networks  <cit> . many mirnas are involved in dm physiopathology: for instance, mir- <dig> controls β cell mass and insulin secretion  <cit> ; mir- <dig> and mir-146a are involved in β-cell apoptosis  <cit> ; mir-30d promotes insulin synthesis and protects β cells from damage by proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> ; mir- <dig> is responsible for impaired angiogenetic signaling in dm patients  <cit> . however, there are no high-throughput  published data on α cells mirna transcriptome at steady state, its comparison with β cells steady state mirna transcriptome, and its alterations following treatment with cytokines. to discover new physiopathologic regulatory mechanisms, specific of cytokine-treated pancreatic cells, we profiled global mirnas expression in two mouse pancreatic cell lines  at steady state and in αtc1- <dig> after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines ifn-γ, il-1β, tnf-α. this analysis brought to the identification of:  differentially expressed  mirnas between αtc1- <dig> and βtc <dig> at steady state;  de mirnas between αtc1- <dig> treated with cytokines and matched untreated controls. to insert our data in the appropriate biological context, we reconstructed the molecular networks regulated at steady state by de mirnas in α and β cells. our results demonstrate that these networks are remarkably different: very likely, they increase α cells resistance to apoptosis and negatively interfere with pancreatic β cells viability after exposure to cytokines.

RESULTS
apoptosis induction by cytokines in αtc1- <dig> and βtc <dig> cells
to verify the differential response of αtc1- <dig> and βtc <dig> cells to treatment with cytokines, we assayed their propensity to undergo apoptosis during a time course experiment . the number of apoptotic αtc1- <dig> cells did not significantly vary with respect to controls for the entire time course , demonstrating that in our system α cells appear to withstand apoptosis induction by cytokines; on the contrary, βtc <dig> cells are clearly more susceptible to treatment .


steady state mirna transcriptome profiles of αtc1- <dig> and βtc <dig> cells
to identify mirnas potentially responsible for αtc1- <dig> resistance to cytokines, we analyzed the steady state mirna transcriptome of αtc1- <dig> and βtc <dig> cells. at steady state,  <dig> mirnas were exclusively expressed in αtc1- <dig> , while  <dig> were expressed only in βtc <dig> ;  <dig> mirnas resulted significantly more expressed in αtc1- <dig> than in βtc <dig>  whereas  <dig> were significantly more expressed in βtc <dig> compared to αtc1- <dig>  . their assignment to specific families is shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

treatment with cytokines alters αtc1- <dig> mirna transcriptome profiles
after treatment with cytokines for  <dig> h,  <dig> mirnas  were significantly differentially expressed in αtc1- <dig> as compared to matched untreated controls  . their assignment to specific families is shown in additional file  <dig> 

mirnas 296-3p and 298-5p are reliable candidates for involvement in αtc1- <dig> higher resistance than β cells to apoptosis induction by cytokines
to identify mirnas whose functions could explain the differential response to cytokines of pancreatic α and β cells, we specifically focused our attention on mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p. both mirnas are expressed at steady state only in αtc1- <dig>  but are not synthesized in βtc <dig> ; both are part of the imprinted gnas/gnas clusters in mice and humans and share more targets than expected by chance , even though their seed regions are different: this suggests common regulatory functions. single taqman gene expression assays  during a time course analysis  showed a highly significant downregulation of mir-296-3p in αtc1- <dig> cells at  <dig> and  <dig> h pt, compared to matched untreated controls . mir-298-5p resulted significantly downregulated starting at  <dig> h pt and reached a highly significant downregulation at  <dig> h pt, compared to matched untreated controls: student’s t-test, bonferroni adjusted p-values, were < <dig>  and < <dig> , respectively . both mirnas were co-expressed in αtc1- <dig> cells throughout the entire experimental time course  . stas confirmed that they are not expressed either in βtc <dig> or ins- <dig> cells.


genomics of genes encoding mir-296-3p, mir-298-5p, nespas and identification of upstream cpg islands
genes encoding mirnas 296-3p and 298-5p are clustered in a genomic region, which also comprises the gene for the noncoding transcript nespas and is imprinted in mice and humans  <cit> . sequences of mature mir-296-3p are 100% conserved between rodents and humans, whereas those of mir-298-5p are 74% identical. analysis of this region through ucsc browser revealed the presence of two clusters of cpg islands:  one comprises two cpg islands, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb upstream the first nucleotide of pre-mir- <dig>  and is located  <dig>  and  <dig> kb downstream nespas transcription start site ;  the other is made of three cpg islands from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb upstream the first nucleotide of pre-mir- <dig> and is located  <dig> - <dig> kb upstream nespas tss . matinspector revealed a putative nespas promoter located  <dig> bp upstream- <dig> bp downstream its tss.

αtc1- <dig> transfection with mimics of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p increases apoptosis levels induced by cytokines
to precisely define mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p biological functions, we compared apoptosis levels of αtc1- <dig> cells, transfected with either one or both mirna mimics and treated with cytokines for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h after transfection , with those of scramble-transfected αtc1- <dig> cells treated with cytokines by following a similar protocol. the percentage of apoptotic αtc1- <dig> cells after transfection with mimics of mir-296-3p was comparable to scramble-transfected controls during the entire time course treatment. on the other hand, transfection with mimics of mir-298-5p or of both mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p increased in a highly significant manner the number of αtc1- <dig> apoptotic cells, compared to matched scramble-transfected controls:  <dig>  and more than  <dig>  folds at  <dig> h pt, respectively  .


identification of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p targets
to characterize the networks regulated by mirnas 296-3p and 298-5p, we computationally searched their validated and predicted targets. we identified  <dig> validated target of mir-296-3p;  <dig> validated targets of mir-298-5p;  <dig> predicted targets of mir-296-3p;  <dig> predicted targets of mir-298-5p. we focused our attention on  <dig> targets of mir-296-3p,  <dig> of mir-298-5p,  <dig> common to both mirnas: they were chosen according to their involvement in apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation and hormone secretion . among them, bcl <dig>  ccna <dig>  irs <dig>  nr4a <dig> are transcriptionally regulated by creb <dig>  which is a validated target of mir-296-3p  <cit> ; tnf and vdr are validated targets of mir-298-5p  <cit> . all other targets were computationally predicted, including igf1rβ that we validated through western analysis .

modulation of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p also alters expression of their targets
to verify whether in vitro modulation of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p affected the expression of their targets, we performed transient transfection experiments of αtc1- <dig> cells with their mimics. transfection efficiency at  <dig> h at was in all cases higher than 90%. in αtc <dig> transfected with mimics of mir-296-3p or mir-298-5p, real-time pcr showed altered expression of different genes with respect to scramble-transfected cells, including igf1r, tnf, vdr .


expression of igf1rβ and tnfα is controlled by mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p in αtc1- <dig> cells
in αtc1- <dig> treated with cytokines for  <dig> h, levels of proteins igf1rβ and tnfα increased  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds with respect to untreated controls, respectively , while mirnas 296-3p and 298-5p decreased of  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds with respect to untreated controls, respectively . we further demonstrated through western analysis that protein igf1rβ decreased about  <dig>  folds in steady-state αtc1- <dig> after transfection with mimics of mir-296-3p or mir-298-5p, as compared to scramble-transfected controls; this decrease was higher than  <dig> folds when cells were transfected with both mimics . the decrease of igf1rβ was not detectable in αtc1- <dig> transfected with either mimic of mir-296-3p or mir-298-5p and then treated with cytokines for  <dig> h. in αtc1- <dig> treated with cytokines for  <dig> h, after transfection with mimics of both mirnas 296-3p and 298-5p, it was instead lower than at steady state . this could also be due to the decrease of mirnas 296-3p and 298-5p following treatment with cytokines . following transfection of αtc1- <dig> with either mimics of mir-296-3p or mir-298-5p, tnfα protein was about  <dig>  folds less expressed with respect to scramble-transfected controls; this decrease was more pronounced  when cells were transfected with both mimics . each of the two mirna mimics decreased the expression of tnfα more than  <dig> folds after  <dig> h of treatment with cytokines, but the silencing effect was not potentiated when the two mimics were transfected together .


activation of irs- <dig> and erk- <dig> is also under control of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p
to verify if the igf1r signaling pathway was controlled by mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p through igf1rβ, we assayed the phosphorylation levels of irs- <dig> and erk  in αtc1- <dig> transfected with mimics of each one or both mirnas; this analysis was performed both after treatment with cytokines for  <dig> h or on untreated cells, exploiting as controls matched scramble-transfected αtc1- <dig> cells. the expression of phospho-irs- <dig> didn’t change in untreated αtc1- <dig> transfected with mimics of each mirna alone, while it decreased about  <dig>  folds in αtc1- <dig> transfected with mimics of both mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p . by using the same controls, we detected a slight decrease of phospho-irs- <dig>  in αtc1- <dig> transfected with mimics of both mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p and treated with cytokines . interestingly, also the activation of erk- <dig> appears to be regulated by mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p: in the absence of treatment with cytokines, αtc1- <dig> cells transfected with mimics of mir-296-3p showed levels of phospho-erk- <dig>  similar to those found in scramble-transfected αtc1- <dig> cells; the transfection with mimics of mir-298-5p or of both mirnas led instead to a decrease of the protein  . under cytokine treatment, the amount of phospho-erk- <dig>  did not change in αtc1- <dig> transfected with either mimics of mir-296-3p or of mir-298-5p alone, compared to scramble-transfected cells; in αtc1- <dig> simultaneously transfected with mimics of both mirnas, we detected a decrease of  <dig>  folds of phospho-erk- <dig>  levels, compared to scramble-transfected cells .


identification of tfs regulating de mirnas
in the genomic region comprising the genes encoding mir-296-3p, mir-298-5p and nespas, matinspector identified transcription factor binding sites  for sixty seven transcription factors . four of them  are known to be expressed in the islets of langerhans, and mafb is known to be expressed only in rodent islet α cells within adult pancreas  <cit> ; the presence of binding sites for this tf within the promoter of the genes encoding mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p suggests that it may regulate the expression of both mirnas. multi experiment matrix  showed a statistically highly significant negative correlation  between mafb and igf1r. interestingly, microrna.org predicts two binding sites for mmu-mir-296-3p and mmu-mir-298-5p on mafb mrna 3’ utr.

differences between αtc1- <dig> and βtc <dig> steady state regulatory networks
 <dig> of  <dig> mirnas, more abundantly or exclusively expressed at steady state in αtc1- <dig> with respect to βtc <dig>  have validated targets known to be expressed in mammalian pancreatic α cells . by using these data, we generated a network comprised of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges : from this network, we inferred a subnetwork made of  <dig> α-mirnas for which validated targets have been identified, consisting of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges . in the case of βtc <dig> cells, we found that  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas more abundantly or exclusively expressed with respect to αtc1- <dig> have validated targets known to be expressed in pancreatic β cells : a network of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges was generated from them . the subnetwork made of  <dig> β-mirnas consisted of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges . the enrichment in specific biological processes was calculated in pancreatic αtc1- <dig> versus βtc <dig> cells subnetworks  . interestingly, in the network of genes regulated by α-mirnas, pancreatic α cell fate commitment is a biological process overrepresented with respect to the network regulated by β-mirnas . within the network of genes regulated by α-mirnas, insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway is a biological process significantly enriched among the genes interacting with targets of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p, with respect to the genes linked to the targets of the other mirnas .

discussion
the data reported in this paper and those from the literature  <cit>  confirm that mammalian pancreatic α cells are more resistant than β cells to apoptosis induced by cytokines . our results suggest that mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p play a pivotal role in determining this trait. due to dm epidemic spreading  <cit> , its molecular characterization has become an important biological and translational problem in biomedicine  <cit> . our ht and network analyses of mirna transcriptome in α and β cells highlighted very different profiles at steady state . computational analysis of these data allowed us to identify a set of mirnas, specifically synthesized in pancreatic α cells, which appear to also regulate pancreatic α cell commitment. specific enrichment of pathways, regulated by α-mirnas within this biological process , allowed the identification of mirnas that could be involved in the acquisition of the trait resistance to cytokines-induced cell death upon pancreatic α cells differentiation. among them, mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p stood out clearly as potentially critical nodes, responsible for α cells resistance to cytokine-induced cell death. in fact, besides being specifically expressed at steady state in α cells , but not in β cells , both mirnas were significantly co-expressed and downregulated in αtc1- <dig> during a time-course treatment with cytokines, compared to matched untreated controls . our subsequent functional assays demonstrated that αtc1- <dig> transfected with mimics of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p became susceptible to apoptosis when treated with the same cocktail of cytokines as compared to αtc1- <dig> transfected with scramble molecules. although its biological effect was potentiated when also mir-296-3p was expressed, our results suggest that the role of mir-298-5p is more important in this process than that of mir-296-3p : this would highlight the role of one or a few specific mir-298-5p targets. through western analysis, we confirmed our computational prediction that igf1rβ and tnfα are common targets to both mirnas and that mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p also control irs- <dig> and erk- <dig> within the igf1r signaling pathway. igf1r is known to promote resistance to apoptosis by different mechanisms: it increases the levels of antiapoptotic proteins, as bcl <dig> and bcl-xl; it inactivates proapoptotic proteins, as bad and casp9; it stimulates mitogenic irs-1/mapks pathway  <cit> . phospho-irs <dig>  and phospho-erk- <dig> , which we demonstrated to be controlled by mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p, are known to regulate the response to insulin and to be involved in survival and proliferation processes  <cit> . decreased expression of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p and the corresponding activation of survival and proliferation signals, mediated by igf1r and its downstream nodes , may thus explain why αtc1- <dig> cells are resistant to death induction by cytokines . tnfα is known to be physiologically expressed by pancreatic endocrine cells and to contribute to maintain islet homeostasis  <cit> . this protein is also known to decrease apoptosis levels of pancreatic acinar cells during acute pancreatitis by stimulating the synthesis of antiapoptotic proteins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
ht mirna profiling data, functional analysis with synthetic mimics and molecular characterisation of modulated pathways strongly suggest that specific downregulation of mir-296-3p and mir-298-5p in pancreatic α cells, coupled to upregulation of their targets as igf1rβ and tnfα and activation of the corresponding signaling pathways, is a major determinant of their resistance to apoptosis induction by cytokines. studies on pancreatic islet microorgan in toto will allow to experimentally confirm these results in a 3d natural system. it also will permit to verify the hypothesis that increased tnfα synthesis by α cells during insulitis protects them by activating survival pathways, while priming a deadly regulatory loop and causing β cells apoptosis .
