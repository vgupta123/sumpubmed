BACKGROUND
ecological speciation is a process in which polymorphism within populations  ultimately induces the appearance of two sister species, each adapted to a different niche . according to rundle and nosil  <cit> , three principal components must be involved: i) a source of divergent selection, ii) a form of reproductive isolation, and iii) a genetic mechanism linking divergent selection to reproductive isolation. among plant-feeding insects, several empirical studies support this scenario  <cit> , which can also occur for insects with a parasitic lifestyle, in particular within the upper trophic levels. for such organisms, ecological differentiation between sister species can also be driven by the ecological differentiation of their hosts via a process called sequential or cascading speciation . if pervasive enough, such processes should lead to the clustering of phylogenetically related specialists.

additionally, transitions between generalists to specialists  are also occurring and, so far, empirical data provide a mixed picture about the relative frequencies of evolution toward specialisation and generalization . however, transitions from generalist ancestors to specialized species are probably recurrent as  generalist species are unlikely to produce “jack-of-all trades-master of none” genotypes because of genetic or physiological trade-off ;  the subsequent acquisition of specialized genotypes may be a primary step towards speciation ; and  specialist species may be more prone to extinction  <cit> . at a phylogenetic level, both kinds of transitions should lead to the mixing of both specialists and generalists within the same cluster.

questions of  the host range  of ancestral species of current specialists and  the distribution of host ranges within a phylogeny were recently addressed by hardy and otto  <cit> . they illustrated them using two notions, respectively “the musical chairs hypothesis”  and the “oscillation hypothesis” . the extent to which one of these scenarios is more frequent has nevertheless still to be evaluated rigorously for the organisms with a parasitic lifestyle.

parasitoids are organisms  whose pre-imaginal life depends on the successful exploitation of a single host  <cit> . behind this simple definition, a great diversity of life history strategies and physiological adaptations are observed. in particular, the ovipositor allows egg-laying by the female and is thus a key organ especially for species that are exploiting concealed or protected hosts  <cit> . the features  of this organ and its ability to evolve could contribute to drive specialization and/or speciation. focusing on the “eupelmus urozonus species group” , we examine here whether the host range is subject to phylogenetic constraints and/or whether the ovipositor length is a significant driver of host use.

within the subfamily eupelminae , the genus eupelmus dalman is the most diverse, with  <dig> available valid species names in the palaearctic region  <cit> . species of eupelmus are primary or facultative secondary ectoparasitoids whose larvae develop as idiobionts on the immature stages  of many insects  that are concealed or protected in plant tissues   <cit> . most eupelmus are considered as generalist parasitoids  <cit> . however, because of both the extreme sexual dimorphism characterizing the subfamily and the existence of species groups possibly hiding cryptic species, the systematics and the evolutionary ecology of these species remain poorly understood. this situation is well illustrated with the “e. urozonus species complex/group” which was repeatedly investigated  until its recent revision within the palaearctic region by al khatib et al.  <cit> , which identified  <dig> new species in this region. semantically, the term “complex” used in al khatib et al.  <cit>  is substituted here by the term “species group” . as a consequence of this unsuspected biodiversity, most of the published host records for these species are unreliable because all of the common species with a comparatively short ovipositor  were misidentified as e. urozonus dalman,  <dig>  while the two common species with a comparatively long ovipositor  were both frequently mistreated under e. annulatus  <cit> .

in the present study, we first provide a reliable molecular phylogeny of the “e. urozonus species group” using a multi-locus approach. then, for most of the species, we compile host records and data on ovipositor length. we finally carry out a comparative analysis to evaluate the role of phylogenetic constraints in the evolution of ovipositor length and host range as well as the role of the ovipositor’s length in determining the host range.

a total of  <dig> species, with  <dig> individuals, sampled in the palaearctic region were included in this study.eighteen of the  <dig> species within the “urozonus species group” that were recently revised using both morphological and molecular characters  <cit> : e. acinellus askew,  <dig>  e. annulatus, e. azureus, e. cerris förster,  <dig>  e. confusus, e. fulvipes förster,  <dig>  e. gemellus, e. janstai delvare and gibson,  <dig>  e. kiefferi, e. longicalvus al khatib & fusu,  <dig>  e. minozonus delvare,  <dig>  e. opacus delvare,  <dig>  e. pistaciae al khatib,  <dig>  e. priotoni delvare,  <dig>  e. purpuricollis fusu & al khatib,  <dig>  e. simizonus al khatib,  <dig>  e. tibicinis bouček,  <dig> and e. urozonus.

marker choice
seven markers displaying various rates of molecular evolution were used: two coding portions of mitochondrial genes , two coding regions of nuclear genes  and three  non-coding regions of other nuclear genes . all these markers were previously used for phylogenetic analyses in arthropods. coi and cytb have been used to resolve insect molecular phylogenies at shallower taxonomic levels . the wg gene has provided a useful tool for the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships at lower to intermediate taxonomic levels in different insect groups . ef-1α has proven to evolve at slow rates and provide phylogenetic information at deeper levels  . the bub <dig> gene is more rarely used  <cit>  for inferring phylogenetic relationships at a similar taxonomic level as wg. finally, ribosomal proteins rpl27a and rps <dig> have been used with success to infer the phylogeny of hymenoptera associated with oak galls or figs .

dna extraction, pcr amplification and sequencing
genomic dna was extracted from a single individual using the qiagen dneasy kit  with some minor modifications with regard to the manufacturer’s protocol. entire specimens were incubated at 56 °c for 15–17 h and dna extraction was performed without destruction of the specimens, to allow subsequent examination of morphology . primer sequences are given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

for the two mitochondrial genes , the pcr mix was prepared in 20 μl as follows: 1 μl of dna ,  <dig>  μl of milli-q water, 2 μl of 10x pcr buffer containing mgcl <dig> , 1 μl of 10 μm primer cocktail ,  <dig>  μl of dntps 25 mm each  and  <dig>  μl of  <dig> u/μl taq dna polymerase .

for the nuclear genes , the pcr mix was realised in 25 μl as follows: 2 μl of dna ,  <dig>  μl of milli-q water,  <dig>  μl of 10x pcr buffer containing mgcl <dig> ,  <dig>  μl of 100 μm primer cocktail ,  <dig>  μl of dntps 25 mm each  and  <dig>  μl of  <dig> u/μl taq dna polymerase .

pcr conditions for wg and coi were as described in  <cit> . those for other genes were as follows: cytb: 94 °c for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of  94 °c for 1 min,  50 °c for 1 min, and  72 °c for 90 s with a final extension at 72 °c for 10 min; nuclear markers: 94 °c for 4 min, followed by 40 cycles of  94 °c for 30 s,  58 °c for ef-1α, 48 °c for bub <dig>  57 °c for rps <dig> and 55 °c for rpl27a,  72 °c for 5 min with final extension at 72 °c for 5 min.

in the absence of amplification or if the signal was too weak, we improved yields of pcrs by using 2x qiagen multiplex pcr master mix . in this case, pcrs were performed in a 25 μl reaction volume: 2 μl of dna,  <dig>  μl of milli-q water,  <dig>  μl of 100 μm primer cocktail  and  <dig>  μl of 2x qiagen multiplex pcr master mix  and pcr conditions were as specified in the qiagen® multiplex pcr kit: 95 °c for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of  95 °c for 30 s,  48 °c-58 °c for 90 s,  72 °c for 1 min, with final extension at 72 °c for 10 min.

all pcrs were performed on a geneamp  <dig> thermocycler. pcr products were visualized using the qiaxcel advanced system and qiaxcel dna fast analysis kit . pcr products were sent to genoscreen  or to beckman coulter genomics  for sequencing in both directions. all sequences were deposited in genbank .

sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
alignment
sequences were aligned using muscle  <cit>  with the default settings as implemented in seaview v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and subsequently visually checked. to assess the impact of indels on the phylogenetic resolution, highly divergent blocks present in bub <dig>  rps <dig> and rpl27a alignments were either included in or excluded from the analyses. these blocks were removed using gblocks  <cit>  with the default settings as implemented in seaview. alignments of coi, cytb, ef-1α and wg were translated to amino acids using mega v <dig>   <cit>  to detect potential frame-shift mutations and premature stop codons, which may indicate the presence of pseudogenes.

gene by gene analysis
to detect  possible inconsistencies linked to contamination during laboratory procedures,  poor-quality sequences,  possible pseudogenes or other artefacts, and  to evaluate the impact of the gblock procedure on the individual phylogenetic resolution, genes were first analysed separately using a maximum likelihood approach .

concatenated datasets analysis
phylogenetic analyses were performed on concatenated nucleotide sequences using both ml and bayesian methods. four partitioning schemes were compared:  two partitions: one for the two mitochondrial genes  and another for all nuclear markers ;  six partitions: one for the two mitochondrial markers  and one for each nuclear marker ;  seven partitions: one for the 1st and 2nd codon positions of the mtdna, one for the 3rd codon positions of mtdna, and one for each nuclear gene ;  nine partitions: same as above with wg and ef-1α further partitioned by codon position .

bayes factors   <cit>  were used to compare the four partitioning schemes. harmonic means of the likelihood scores were used as estimators of the marginal likelihoods. following  <cit>  and  <cit> , bayes factors were calculated using the following formula: bf =  <dig> ×  +  × ln  where lnmi and pi are the harmonic-mean of the ln likelihoods and the number of free parameters of the model i, respectively. bf values were interpreted following  <cit>  and  <cit> , with bf values between  <dig> and  <dig>  between  <dig> and  <dig> and higher than  <dig> indicating positive evidence, strong evidence, and very strong evidence favouring one model over the others respectively.

evolution models and phylogenetic reconstruction
for the separated and concatenated datasets, the best-fitting model was identified using the akaike information criterion  as implemented in jmodeltest v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

for both gene-by-gene and concatenated analyses, maximum likelihood analyses and associated bootstrapping were performed using raxml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the gtrcat approximation of models was used for ml bootstrapping . bootstrap percentages  ≥85 % were considered as strong support and bp < 65 % as weak.

bayesian analyses were performed only on the concatenated dataset using a parallel version of mrbayes v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . model parameters for each data partition were independently estimated by unlinking parameters across partitions. parameter values for the model were initiated with default uniform priors, and branch lengths were approximated using default exponential priors. bayesian inferences were estimated using two simultaneous, independent runs of markov chain monte carlo , including three heated and one cold chains. the metropolis-coupled mcmc algorithm  <cit>  was used to improve the mixing of markov chains. analyses were run for  <dig> ×  <dig> generations with parameter values sampled every  <dig> generations. to ensure convergence,  <dig> ×  <dig> generations were used for the most complex partitioning scheme  with parameter values sampled every  <dig> generations. to increase and improve the swap frequencies of states between cold and heated chains, the heating temperature  was set to  <dig>  for the most complex partitioning scheme cleaned with gblocks and to  <dig>  for all other datasets. convergence was assessed using the standard deviation of split frequencies given by mrbayes and the effective sample size , as estimated using tracer v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the first 25 % of the tree samples from the cold chain were discarded and considered as burn-in. posterior probabilities  ≥  <dig>  were considered as strong support and pp <  <dig>  as weak.

analyses were conducted using the cipres science gateway   <cit> .

evolutionary properties of marker sequences
for each partition of the concatenated datasets , base composition, substitution rates, and among sites rate variation  were estimated and compared. we also compared rate variation among partitions, considering the parameter m .

comparative analysis
evolution of ovipositor length
the ovipositor of hymenoptera is a complex organ that exhibits great interspecific variation . in species of eupelmus, part of the ovipositor is easily visible at the extremity of the abdomen , while the rest is concealed in the abdomen. the use of this visible part as a “proxy” of the total ovipositor length is a priori tempting in order to avoid damaging of specimens of newly described species known from very few individuals  <cit> . in order to validate the use of this proxy, a total of  <dig> individuals of comparatively common species  were dissected and, for each individual, we measured the length of the ovipositor stylet, the visible part of the ovipositor sheath and the metatibia . measurements of the length of the ovipositor sheaths and hind tibia followed al khatib et al.  <cit>  . the length of the ovipositor stylet  was measured from the articulation of the second valvula with the articulating bulb to the apex of the second valvula . using this dataset, we found evidence of linear relationships between the ovipositor sheath  and either the ovipositor stylet or the metatibia as predictors . moreover, no interaction was found between these two predictors and the host species . this suggests that the visible part of the ovipositor sheath can indeed be used as a reliable proxy of the entire ovipositor.

as a consequence, a first analysis was performed on the  <dig> species of the “e. urozonus species group” for which information about the ovipositor sheaths and the metatibia were available. this analysis includes a total of  <dig> individuals, with at least  <dig> individuals/species except for e. priotoni and e. simizonus . in most of the cases, we tried to select individuals from at least two geographical locations and/or, for generalist species, two host species . both the absolute length of the ovipositor sheath  and the ratio  between the ovipositor sheaths and the metatibia were taken into account, the second one being potentially less sensitive to environmental-induced phenotypic plasticity . aos/ros medians were then calculated for each eupelmus species and these medians were used for the subsequent analysis .

two tests were then performed:  a mantel test of the correlation between pairwise genetic distances  and pairwise differences in aos/ros .  similarities were estimated as |di-dj|/ ;  the detection of a phylogenetic signal based on categories of aos/ros. for this purpose, “long ovipositors”  were distinguished from “short ovipositors” . briefly, the sum of state changes was calculated, leading to a d statistic that could be tested against two theoretical distributions: a phylogenetic randomness and a brownian distribution, this latter being underlain by a continuous trait evolving along the phylogeny at a constant rate  <cit> .

influence of phylogeny and ovipositor length on host range
a second analysis was restricted to a subset of  <dig> species for which host range was also available. most of the information about host range was obtained from al khatib et al.  <cit>  and from gibson and fusu . jean lecomte  communicated the rearing of e. confusus from curculionid larvae. taken as a whole, our host survey is probably not exhaustive but nevertheless encompassed a total of several thousands of individuals of the “e. urozonus species group” and, with regard to the host’s diversity,  <dig> insect species representing  <dig> families and  <dig> orders . taken as a whole, these host insects were distributed on  <dig> plant families. dissimilarities in host range were calculated—at three taxonomic levels  for the host insect and at one level  for the host plant—using the bray-curtis distance, each host taxon being treated qualitatively . this information was summarized and presented as “ecological matrices”. correlations between “phylogenetic”, “morphological” and “ecological” matrices were tested using simple  or partial  mantel tests, the relevance of these last tests having been repeatedly discussed .fig.  <dig> phylogram of relationships among species of the “eupelmus urozonus species group” obtained from the concatenated dataset alignment  without the gblocks cleaning of divergent blocks. uppercase letters refer to clades discussed in the text. nodes with likelihood bootstrap  values < <dig> have been collapsed. bp  and bayesian posterior probabilities  are indicated at nodes. each line represents a sequenced individual with information in the following order: molecular code, species and country 



moreover, three kinds of traits were investigated using d-statistics :host specificity . this specificity was evaluated at the order-family taxonomic level and at the species level. because one may argue that our sampling underestimates specialists, we also performed this analysis under the assumption that all the rare species  could be specialists.

software and packages
manipulations of files and statistical tests were conducted using the software r  with the following packages “ade4”   <cit> , “ape”   <cit> , “caper” , “ecodist”   <cit>  and “vegan”   <cit> .

RESULTS
alignments and single-marker analyses
successful amplification and sequencing was completed for all gene regions used in this study. however, sequencing failures occurred for some markers for a few individuals. genbank accessions of the sequences obtained for all analysed genes are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the final matrix contained  <dig> specimens. no stop codons, frame shifts, insertions or deletions were observed in coding gene regions.

the numbers of aligned base pairs, variable sites and parsimony-informative sites for each gene are summarized in table  <dig>  as expected, mitochondrial genes showed more parsimony-informative sites compared to nuclear markers . among the nuclear markers, ef-1α exhibited the lowest number of variable and parsimony-informative sites . for rpl27a, removing the highly divergent alignment blocks significantly reduced the number of variable and parsimony-informative sites . this loss consequently affected the resolution of the corresponding inferred topology . in contrast, the gblocks procedure did not affect the number of variable and parsimony-informative sites for bub <dig> and rps <dig> and the resolution of the corresponding topologies .table  <dig> numbers and percentage of aligned base pairs, variable sites and parsimony-informative sites for the genes used in this study

evolution models and partitions in the concatenated dataset
alignment lengths of the concatenated datasets with or without the exclusion of highly divergent blocks were 3197 bp and 5000 bp respectively. for all partitions, the best-fitting substitution model was the general time reversible model  with among-sites rate variation  modelled by a discrete gamma distribution   <cit>  for which we used four categories. for all bayesian analyses, after discarding 25 % of the samples as burn-in, the ess value of each parameter largely exceeded  <dig>  which indicated that convergence of runs was reached. sixteen combined trees were obtained . for all combined datasets, bayes factors showed that the most complex partitioning scenario  was preferred over the three less complex ones .table  <dig> partitioning strategy selecting using bayes factors  in bayesian analyses

as expected, the mitochondrial partitions showed high base compositional bias . among the nuclear gene partitions, rpl27a, bub <dig> and rps <dig> were a/t-biased  while the a/t percentage in the 3rd codon positions in wg and ef-1α was only  <dig> and 45 % respectively.

with the exception of ef-1α 1st and 2nd codon positions , there was an overall higher rate of a-g and c-t transitions . more precisely, mtdna , bub <dig> and wg 1st & 2nd codon positions were in excess of c-t transitions.

for protein-coding genes , the rate multiplier parameter  was higher for the 3rd codon positions. thus, mtdna 3rd codon positions evolved more than sixteen times faster than the fastest nuclear gene .

the shape parameter of the gamma distribution  was also higher for the 3rd codon position of the protein coding genes, indicating that these positions show lower rate heterogeneity among sites. additionally, α was lower for bub <dig> than for rps <dig> and rpl27a, indicating that bub <dig> had a greater rate of heterogeneity among sites.

phylogenetic trees inferred from concatenated datasets
impacts of alignment strategy and reconstruction methods
ml and bayesian topologies obtained from the concatenated alignments without gblocks cleaning were more resolved than those obtained with removal of poorly aligned blocks. whatever the partitioning scheme and regardless of whether or not divergent blocks were included in the analyses, most internal nodes were nevertheless statistically supported . moreover, the  <dig> species recently defined by al khatib et al.  <cit>  and e. vindex were recovered as a monophyletic group.

overall, topologies showed three major clades  that emerge on highly supported basal nodes . three topological conflicts were observed depending on whether or not the gblocks cleaning step was performed:  clade a was not supported in topologies inferred from the datasets cleaned using gblocks ;  e. vindex was sister to the rest of clade c in the topologies inferred from data sets cleaned using gblocks , while it was sister to e. confusus and e. pistaciae  without gblocks cleaning ;  the relationships of e. matranus and e. pini were resolved when gblocks was used  , but not resolved without gblocks cleaning of data sets . taken as a whole, we decided to favour the alignment without the gblocks procedure for the comparative analysis in order to favour the resolution for the terminal nodes.fig.  <dig> phylogram of relationships among species of the “eupelmus urozonus species group” obtained from the concatenated dataset alignment  with gblocks-default parameters. uppercase letters refer to clades discussed in the text. nodes with likelihood bootstrap  values < <dig> have been collapsed. bp  and bayesian posterior probabilities  are indicated at nodes. each line represents a sequenced individual with information in the following order: molecular code, species, and country

molecular relationships within the “eupelmus urozonus species group”
ml and bayesian analyses performed on the most complex partitioning scheme without gblocks cleaning produced similar topologies with only a few differences for poorly supported nodes . we therefore mapped all node support values  on the ml topology .

in all analyses, the “e. urozonus species group” was recovered as monophyletic  with a strong support. the group was subdivided into three clades, “clades” being defined here as a statistically-supported basal divergence including several species:clade a included e. acinellus, e. annulatus, e. azureus, e. cerris, e. gemellus, e. longicalvus and e. simizonus, whose relative positions were not resolved to the exception of the sister species relationship between e. acinellus and e. gemellus .

clade b included three species with e. vindex being sister to e. confusus plus e. pistaciae with strong support .

clade c included the remaining species and namely e. fulvipes, e. janstai, e. kiefferi, e. minozonus, e. opacus, e. priotoni, e. purpuricollis, e. tibicinis and e. urozonus. within clade c, two well-supported  subclades—“sub-clade” being defined as a more terminal divergence including at least  <dig> species—can be distinguished  e. opacus, e. priotoni, e. purpuricollis and e. janstai;  e. minozonus and e. urozonus. these two subclades together with e. tibicinis, whose exact phylogenetic position remains unclear, form a well-supported monophyletic group .

there were significant interspecific differences for both the absolute  and relative  ovipositor lengths . aos ranged from 398 μm in e. minozonus to a maximum of 1179 μm in e. cerris while ros ranged from a minimum of  <dig>  in e. fulvipes to a maximum of  <dig>  in e. janstai. even if aos and ros medians were significantly correlated one with another , some discrepancies were observed as for e cerris which exhibits the highest aos but an intermediate ros .

within the “eupelmus urozonus species group”, there was no significant correlation between similarity in ovipositor length and phylogenetic distance . when ovipositor length was treated as a binary variable with “long” ovipositors being those above the third quartile , the observed d-statistics for aos  and ros  never departed from a random distribution  or a brownian one . consequently, it seems that no strong clustering existed on the length of the ovipositor sheaths. remarkable differences in the length of the ovipositor sheaths were even observed between some sister species: e. acinellus—e. gemellus in clade a and e. janstai—e. purpuricollis in clade b .

taken as a whole, our results indicated that both cynipidae and cecidomyiidae constitute the main host species for west palearctic "e. urozonus species group" . yet, contrasted feeding regimes  were observed . only three  of the  <dig> species are strict specialists, with a distribution  not significantly departing from both a random  or a brownian distribution . at the family and order level , three other species were specialists of cynipidae—e. azureus , e. cerris  and e. fulvipes —and one  on cecidomyiidae. at these levels, the relative distribution of specialists and generalists  does not differs from a random  or brownian distribution  and, as shown in fig. 33b, about 50–60 % of the described species in each of the three clades were specialists. the absence of a phylogenetic signal still holds under the assumption that all rare species  are specialists. departures from a random distribution is never significant  while a significant departure is observed from a brownian distribution at the host order’s level . interestingly, contrasted host ranges were observed between sister species: e. gemellus —e. acinellus  within clade a and e. confusus —e. pistaciae  within clade b .

we investigated the ability of the “e. urozonus species group” to parasitize host species belonging to coleoptera, diptera, hymenoptera and lepidoptera  or cecidomyiidae within diptera and cynipidae within hymenoptera  . however, in all these cases, we were not able to observe significant departures from a random or a brownian distribution .

correlations between phylogenetic, morphometric  and ecological  matrices were also tested using simple or partial mantel tests, at each of the three levels . overall, the mantel coefficients ranged between − <dig>  and + <dig>  and were never significantly different from zero . at the host species level, such a result could be explained by the fact that only 24 % of the hosts  are shared by at least two species of the “e. urozonus species group”. as a consequence, this level of investigation may be too precise to detect any signal. however, such a limit cannot be taken into account at the two other taxonomic levels since about half of the host families and all host orders except neuroptera are shared by at least two species of eupelmus. taken as a whole, these results confirm those obtained using d-statistics about the absence of significant phylogenetic constraints on the host range evolution. the relative ovipositor length also does not appear to be a significant driver of the host use.

when host plants rather than host insects are taken into account,  <dig> plant families were identified , eight of which being used by only one eupelmus species. however, four main families were used by at least four eupelmus species: asteraceae , fagaceae , rosaceae  and salicaceae . for each of these families, no phylogenetic signal was detected using the d-statistics . additionally, no correlation was found between the related ecological matrix and the phylogenetic, and/or morphometric  matrices .

discussion
phylogenetic relationships within the “e. urozonus species group”
phylogenetic inter-specific relationships within the “e. urozonus species group” occurring in the palaearctic region were recently investigated by al khatib et al.  <cit>  based on morphological characters and two genetic markers . this study showed an unsuspected diversity but it  failed to resolve phylogenetic relationships at both deep and intermediate levels,  highlighted some discrepancies among tree topologies at the shallowest nodes resulting from coi and wg sequences,  did not include morphologically divergent but potentially phylogenetically closely related species. by considering new species and adding more informative markers, the present study improved the knowledge on the evolutionary history of the “e. urozonus species group”.

although the phylogenetic resolution was proven to be sensitive to inclusion or exclusion of divergent blocks by using gblocks procedure from the sequence alignments, we obtained a reliable phylogeny which strongly supported the monophyly of our focus group of eupelmus, including the  <dig> species treated in al khatib et al.  <cit>  and e. vindex, which is morphologically distinct from other members of the group in the shape of the syntergum and the anterior displacement of the ovipositor sheaths . additionally, the included species of the “e. urozonus species group” were distributed in three strongly supported clades, referred here as a, b and c .

the molecular monophyly of the palaearctic “e. urozonus species group” reflected in our concatenated datasets can be also supported through morphology. al khatib et al.  recently compared and combined the results of phylogenetic inferences using the molecular data presented here with morphological data. the main conclusion of this complementary work seems to be the structuration of eupelmus as a set of independent species groups . their delineation and their morphological supports are therefore not detailed here.

despite using several loci from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, some of the focal taxa remain poorly resolved. we expect that newer methods that dramatically increase the number of loci will help to better resolve these relationships .

ecological differentiation within the “e. urozonus species group”
the diversification of parasitic organisms has been explained by various processes linking ecological specialization and speciation. for parasitoids, phylogenetic information and reliable host ranges are necessary to describe the patterns  and to understand the underlying processes . this motivated the present work. although members of the genus eupelmus are usually described as generalist ectoparasitoids  <cit> , our study nevertheless leads to a more complex pattern. our results indeed showed the coexistence of “strict” specialists restricted to one specific host , intermediate specialists that can parasitize various species of cynipidae  and generalists that are able to successfully develop on different insect orders .

this diversity in host use observed in the “e. urozonus species group” does not seem to be driven by phylogenetic history as generalists and specialists were recovered in each of the three clades. moreover, some sister species exhibited fully contrasted ecologies : e. confusus—e. pistaciae and e. gemellus—e. acinellus. in this last case, because the facultative hyperparasitism lifestyle is recorded for some species of eupelmus, we strongly suspect that e. gemellus develops as a hyperparasitoid of e. acinellus on mesophleps oxycedrella . if this is true, it would mean that none of these generalists  share any hosts with its sister species. even if it is not the case, such contrasting patterns of host use remain, to our knowledge, rare in parasitoid species.

quite similar conclusions arose when host plants instead hosts insects were taken into account. there was indeed no correlation between host plant ranges, phylogenetic and/or morphometric constraints. moreover, the use of the four main plant families  did not seem to be constrained by the phylogenetic history. the underlying rationale of this complementary analysis was that host plants could at least partly determine ecological specialization of eupelmus species insofar as the parasitoid species could use, innately or through learning, plant-linked cues in order to locate favourable environments, be the cues emitted passively  or actively  . one criticism to this approach would, of course, be the level  at which our analysis was performed since it implies that only well-conserved cues could be detected.

a final facet of our investigation was the potential role of the ovipositor sheaths  as a driver of host use. the rationale was that  ovipositor structure could be constrained by the phylogenetic history of the species and,  ovipositor length could determine accessibility to different hosts  <cit> . none of these hypotheses was however verified, ovipositor length appearing to be a very labile trait within our focus group.

another driver of host range evolution could be the complexity of gall communities exploited by the eupelmus species. indeed, in numerous cases, eupelmus species are occurring with numerous parasitoid species belonging to different chalcid families  which seem to be more functionally adapted to their hosts . such recurrent interspecific competitions may represent a potential limit for the abundance of eupelmus but may also, ultimately, offer evolutionary opportunities. in particular, such an ecological intimacy could promote some switches towards unusual but ecologically related host insects and/or transitions towards other developmental modes . such kind of adaptations may be illustrated by e. tibicinis, a specialist predator of the eggs of the red cicada, tibicina haematodes  .

CONCLUSIONS
this paper provides comprehensive information about the ecological differentiation within the palaearctic species of the “e. urozonus species group” and contributes to our understanding of ecological specialization in parasitoids. although further investigations are required, the intimate mixing of generalist and specialist species along the phylogeny leans toward the “oscillation hypothesis” . it also raises new questions at both the inter- and intra-specific levels. at the intra-specific level, more detailed population genetics studies would be useful to test the existence of “host races” within generalist species, which could be a way to,  explain the capacity of a single species to develop in different hosts and  offer opportunities for the recurrent apparition of specialized lineages and ultimately species. at the interspecific level, the partitioning of the available resources within sympatric eupelmus species and with other chalcid wasps remains unclear. this would probably require a better knowledge of potential and realised host ranges, interspecific interactions  and investigations on the influence of host plants on the associated parasitoids . finally, an agronomic output of such investigations would be a better knowledge of the actual potential of some eupelmus species to regulate certain insect pests such as the olive fruit fly, bactrocera oleae   or the chestnut gall wasp dryocosmus kuriphilus yasumatsu,  <dig> .
