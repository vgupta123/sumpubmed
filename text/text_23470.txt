BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is responsible for a variety of diseases in humans and animals. as a prominent nosocomial pathogen it is mainly responsible for urinary tract, respiratory tract or blood infections  <cit> . in addition, because of the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamases and carbapenemases, such as the recently described ndm- <dig>  <cit> , multi, extremely or pan-drug resistant clinical strains are more frequently isolated  <cit> . in addition, k. pneumoniae has re-emerged as a cause of community-acquired infections including pneumonia and the characteristic syndrome of pyogenic liver abscess, with possible complications including endophthalmitis or meningitis  <cit> . k. pneumoniae is, thus, an important virulent pathogen able to cause serious infections in ambulatory, otherwise healthy hosts and to spread within patients  <cit>  that requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the various forms of its pathogenesis.

major k. pneumoniae virulence factors include the capsule, the lipopolysaccharide, iron scavenging systems and adhesins  <cit> . the capsule is one of the most important virulence determinants, protecting against serum bactericidal activity, antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis  <cit> . at least  <dig> capsular  types can be distinguished, but types k <dig> and k <dig> are prominent by their virulence in murine models of infection  <cit>  and by their epidemiological prevalence  <cit> . however, not all k1/k2-type strains are necessarily virulent, as distinct clonal groups of k <dig> and k <dig> differ sharply by their virulence  <cit> . reference strain kp <dig>   is a highly virulent strain from which important virulence factors, including the large virulence plasmid harboring the regulator of mucoid phenotype  and the aerobactin cluster, were identified  <cit> . even though a virulence plasmid-cured strain is less virulent than the parental strain, it remained more virulent than other isolates that do not harbor this plasmid  <cit> , showing that factors other than capsule overexpression and aerobactin account for the higher pathogenesis of this strain. therefore, although known virulence factors are certainly crucial for bacterial survival, protection and interaction with the host, putative new virulence factors that could subvert host cell physiology and response remain yet to be identified.

comparative genomics of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains is a powerful approach to identify putative virulence genes. several draft or complete genomes of clinical isolates of k. pneumoniae have been published so far, but only the virulent serotype k <dig> strain ntuh-k <dig>  <cit>  has been described in detail. in order to identify new k. pneumoniae k <dig> virulence factors, we sequenced the genome of the virulent strain kp <dig> , as well as two additional strains of low virulence, sb <dig>  and sb <dig> . by comparing these three novel genomes to the publicly available genomes of the virulent k <dig> strain ntuh-k <dig> and reference strain mgh  <dig>  we identified in kp <dig>  putative virulence genes and analyzed their distribution within a diverse collection of k. pneumoniae strains. we demonstrate that a gene coding for a phospholipase d family protein , located within a type vi secretion system locus, is expressed in vivo, is involved in controlling bacterial membrane lipid composition, and is a new virulence factor.

RESULTS
genome assembly and annotation
the genomes of kp <dig> , sb <dig> and sb <dig> were sequenced by a combination of  <dig> and illumina technologies using single and paired-end libraries. finishing efforts resulted in the complete genome sequence of k. pneumoniae kp <dig>  , comprising  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  protein coding genes . sb <dig> and sb <dig> genomes were assembled in  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds, respectively. the gc% of these three genomes ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the general features of the k. pneumoniae sequenced genomes are summarized in table  <dig> 
k. pneumoniae 
genomes analyzed

the three genomes sequenced in this study are compared to strains ntuh and mgh, previously published. pcg, protein coding genes.

because kp <dig>  is a highly virulent strain, our analyses were focused on comparing its genome with the genomes of k. pneumoniae strains sb <dig>  sb <dig>  ntuh-k <dig> and mgh <dig>  according to seed subsystems annotations  <cit> , about 60% of protein-coding genes for each k. pneumoniae genome had predicted functions. more specifically, the largest percentage of annotated genes is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates , of amino acids and their derivatives  and of cofactors, vitamins and prosthetic groups  .

common genome
to define the common genome of the five strains, we used stringent blastclust parameters of at least 90% identity and at least 80% coverage. this analysis identified  <dig>  coding sequences common to the five genomes. the majority of proteins are involved in metabolic processes, such as energy metabolism and transporters, supporting the general concept that the core genome encompasses essential functions required for survival of the microorganism. the k. pneumoniae core genome comprised several sets of genes whose functions are related to bacterial survival in the environment or interaction with its host, and possibly virulence. this was the case, for example, of genes involved in quorum-sensing and biofilm formation, adhesins, and secretion systems, for which examples are detailed below.

genes encoding for autoinducer- <dig> and type iii fimbria, involved in biofilm formation in k. pneumoniae <cit> , were present in all sequenced strains. in addition, genes coding for synthesis and transport of the poly-β- <dig> -n-acetyl-d-glucosamine  adhesin  which is required for the structural stability of escherichia coli biofilms  <cit> , and yide , which mediates the hyperadherence phenotype of e. coli <cit> , were also found in the core genome of k. pneumoniae strains.

moreover, the five k. pneumoniae genomes contained the genes bara/uvry  and ycjx/ycjf  that may be involved in bacterial fitness and virulence. the two-component system bara/uvry  contributes to biofilm formation in salmonella enterica and is a virulence determinant of urinary tract e. coli infections  <cit> . the e. coli ycjf protein is expressed in a septicemia murine model of infection in which the ycjf mutant is attenuated, thus suggesting its implication in the in vivo survival/multiplication of the bacteria  <cit> .

several putative secretion systems were identified as part of the common genome of the k. pneumoniae strains, including one type i secretion system  and one type ii secretion system . t2ss is composed of the pullulanase related genes pula-o that are involved in the pathogenesis of several bacteria  <cit> . streptococcus pyogenes pula binds to host lung glycogen leading to a strong interaction with alveolar type ii cells  <cit> . similarly, the alpha-amylase amya degrades glycogen into cyclic maltodextrins, which increases the transepithelial translocation of streptococcus <cit> . both amya and pula-o genes are encoded in k. pneumoniae genomes, but their functions in this bacterium remain to be characterized. type vi secretion system  putative genes were located in at least three different loci of the k. pneumoniae genomes, in accordance with a previous in-silico study  <cit> . t6ss clusters are usually found within pathogenicity islands or on chromosomal regions presenting virulence or host survival biases. additionally, t6ss has been suggested to assist colonization and infection. indeed, in a screen that identified k. pneumoniae mutants failing to colonize mice  <cit> , two of them were mutants in genes coding for proteins annotated as hypothetical, that have been subsequently re-annotated as t6ss proteins  <cit> . type iii secretion systems were not found in klebsiella, but type iv secretion systems, possibly corresponding to conjugation apparatus, were present only in some strains  .
k. pneumoniae 
genomes analyzed

furthermore, the core genome presented a large genomic region located between gly-trna and phe-trna loci in kp <dig>  genome, containing frdabcd genes coding for the fumarate reductase enzymatic complex responsible for fumarate respiration under anaerobic growth of bacteria. this complex is a virulence determinant for helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and s. enterica, as mutants on these genes are attenuated  <cit> . the ability to grow anaerobically allows bacterial pathogens to persist in host tissues, including in the lungs. curiously, this genomic locus encoded in k. pneumoniae at least one more protein involved in anaerobic metabolism, the anaerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporter dcua , supporting the idea that this gi provides k. pneumoniae advantages to grow under anaerobic conditions, possibly favoring infection. additional proteins that might be involved in bacterial fitness to environmental stress conditions were encoded in this region. for instance, the putative small multidrug resistance protein suge  has been shown to regulate biofilm formation and capsule expression  <cit> . a lipocalin- <dig> bacterial protein bcl  is also encoded in this island of the genome. eukaryotic lipocalins are small extracellular proteins that bind hydrophobic ligands and fulfill numerous biological functions including regulation of cellular homeostasis and immunity and are regulators of antibacterial defense  <cit> . lipocalin <dig> is for instance a siderophore scavenger for several bacteria, including k. pneumoniae <cit> , as well as a negative regulator of inflammatory response during streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia  <cit> . however, the role of bacterial lipocalins is not yet known.

finally, a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase  might be important for the integrity of the bacterial membrane composition, as phospholipid biosynthetic pathways play crucial roles in the virulence of several pathogens  <cit> .

accessory genome
the accessory genome  included a large number of specific coding sequences :  <dig> genes were found only in kp <dig> ,  <dig> in ntuh-k <dig>   <dig> in sb <dig>   <dig> in sb <dig> and  <dig> in mgh <dig>  about 50% of these genes code for hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function. the distribution of the putative virulence-related genes of k. pneumoniae among the sequenced strains is summarized in table  <dig>  the specific regions or genes of kp <dig>  are detailed below.

kp <dig>  plasmids
strain kp <dig>  possessed two plasmids . the first plasmid of  <dig> kb carried the aerobactin cluster and the regulator of mucoid phenotype rmpa genes. the presence of this plasmid was previously correlated with the virulence of k. pneumoniae k <dig> and k <dig> isolates  <cit> . additionally, a strain cured from this plasmid showed a  <dig> × 104-fold reduction in virulence, establishing the link between this plasmid and bacterial virulence  <cit> . in addition to aerobactin and rmpa, this plasmid contained genes coding for f-pilin, purine metabolism, insertion sequences and proteins of unknown functions. kp <dig>  also carried a second, previously non-described, plasmid of about  <dig> kb. interestingly, it contained rmpa <dig>  a homologue of the regulator of mucoid phenotype rmpa, which seems to be involved in capsule expression regulation  <cit> . f-pilin genes, a subtilisin-related serine protease, an aaa + atpase, the uv protection system umud/umuc and the genes encoding the toxin-antitoxin systems rele/orf <dig> and vagd/vagc  were also found on this plasmid. however, the potential role of these genes in virulence remains to be investigated.

genomic islands identified in the genome of strain kp <dig> 
in addition to the capsule synthesis operon and the iron-acquisition systems , known to be involved in k. pneumoniae virulence, four additional regions of the kp <dig>  genome presented several characteristics of pathogenicity islands . these regions are defined by a different gc content in comparison to the average of the genome, represented large chromosomal regions , were associated with trna genes or with the presence of insertion sequences, integrases and transposases, and were present in pathogenic strains while less frequent in less-virulent strains  <cit> . the four gis present in the kp <dig>  genome were present or partially present in ntuh, but none of them was present in sb <dig>  sb <dig> and mgh  <dig>  indicating that their occurrence is specific to pathogenic genomes. figure  <dig> shows the four gis identified, highlighting the putative virulence related genes.

genomic island  <dig> : ice-kp1-like region
the largest gi found in the kp <dig>  genome comprised  <dig>  bp, presented a gc content of 52%, was inserted in an asn-trna locus and encoded  <dig> cdss . most of the protein-coding genes found in this region were described as part of the icekpi gi of ntuh-k <dig>  <cit> , although several differences were found. kp <dig>  gi-i begins at asn trna locus followed by several uncharacterized proteins and insertion sequence elements. gi-i coded for the synthesis of two polyketide/nonribosomal peptides  and for the conjugative transfer machinery  that allows horizontal transfer of the island  <cit> . in contrast to the previous description of icekpi  <cit> , the kp <dig> _gi-i carried colibactin and did not contain the region coding for vagc-vagd, iron-irob-iroc-irod and rmpa genes which are carried only by the  <dig> kb plasmid in kp <dig> .

genomic island  <dig> 
we describe here a novel gi . it is a  <dig>  bp island, with a gc content of 49% and coding for  <dig> cdss which is inserted in a leu-trna locus . potential pathogenesis-related genes coded for a putative cytotoxic outer membrane protein  and a polyamine abc transport system . comp closest known homologue  was a plesiomonas shigelloides predominant virulence factor proposed to trigger cell death in host cells following infection  <cit> . polyamine biosynthesis and transport mechanisms were intricately linked to fitness, survival, biofilm formation and pathogenesis, for instance in s. pneumoniae and yersinia pestis <cit> . additionally, this gi encoded a 4-phytase gene , ugpq <dig>  and xyla, xynt, xynb, xylr  that are involved in xylose metabolism.

genomic island  <dig> 
the third gi is characterized by a  <dig>  bp region presenting a g + c content of 51% and contained  <dig> cdss, most of them coding for phage structural proteins . this gi included genes coding for proteins with homologues that were shown to play a role in bacterial adhesion and immune system escape  <cit> . these proteins encoded for an immunoglobulin domain-containing protein , a peptidase s24-like protein , two hnh family endonucleases  and an exonuclease .

genomic island  <dig> 
the forth island  was mainly comprised of phage-related genes. among the  <dig> cdss encoded within this genomic region, one gene coded for a sefir-domain containing protein . a sefir domain is usually found in il <dig> receptors and sef proteins, acting in eukaryotes signaling pathways. very little is known about prokaryotic sefir-containing proteins. structural analyses suggested that these bacterial sefir domains share structural and electrostatic similarity with their mammalian homologues and, thereby, could potentially subvert host immunity by hijacking the il17r signaling pathways  <cit> . notably, local production of il- <dig> is a significant factor in effective host defense against gram-negative bacteria, including k. pneumoniae <cit> . therefore, further studies are required to elucidate whether kpst66_ <dig> is implicated in k. pneumoniae pathogenesis.

distribution of gis among k. pneumoniae strains
to investigate the distribution of the described gis in k. pneumoniae, the presence of the putative virulence-related genes was searched using blastn in  <dig> genomes, including  <dig> publicly available and  <dig> unpublished genomes  representing  <dig> different sequence types . whereas the sefir-domain containing protein gene of gi-iv was only found in two  isolates of sequence type st <dig>  the three other gis described herein were more distributed among k. pneumoniae isolates . gi-ii genes were present in a total of  <dig>  isolates, most of which belonged to st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  which were associated with severe infections caused by isolates of capsular serotype k <dig>  <cit> . the genes of gi-ii were always found in synteny. gi-iii genes were observed in only seven  isolates dispersed in several unrelated sts. the distribution of the icekpi element  has been previously analyzed  <cit> .
k. pneumoniae 
isolates

aaccording to ref.  <cit> . prevalence of virulence-related features encoded in gi-ii, gi-iii, gi-iv and t6ss insertion was based on >90% identity and >50% coverage in the length of the genes, using a database of  <dig> klebsiella genomes representative of  <dig> different sts. sts, sequence types.

t6ss locus iii insertion
recently, three different t6ss loci were defined in k. pneumoniae <cit> . within these loci, three putative valine-glycine repeat  proteins and two hemolysin-coregulated proteins  were described as potential effector proteins, through their sequence similarities to vibriocholerae and pseudomonasaeruginosa effector proteins  <cit> . accordingly, the kp <dig>  genome also presented three conserved t6ss loci syntenic to those previously described. the first two loci were identical in composition and orientation to the previously described ones. the third one, locus iii, had conservation of adjacency limited to the imcf/impg/imph and impj/ompa/vgrg gene clusters, as a region with nine genes was inserted between these two clusters. this insertion encoded for one hypothetical protein, five putative sel- <dig> repeat containing lipoproteins and three putative phospholipase d family proteins . flanking sequences suggesting how this region was inserted were not found.

sel <dig> lipoproteins are poorly characterized and there was no evidence for their function in k. pneumoniae, but they are essential in legionellapneumophila for invasion of host cells where they influence vacuolar trafficking of bacteria  <cit> . the three open reading frames encoding putative phospholipase d proteins in strain kp <dig>  encoded one full length protein , one c-terminal region  and one n-terminal region . phospholipase d family proteins have been described as important for host cell invasion, bacterial dissemination and disease progression  <cit> . the bacterial phospholipase d family comprises at least four classes of proteins with distinct functions: true phospholipase d, cardiolipin synthase, phosphatidylserine synthase and endonuclease  <cit> . full length k. pneumoniae pld <dig> and its closest homologs all presented the conserved motif hxk4d and a serine or threonine approximately eight residues after asparagine , but no other conserved domain was described in each family, thus making it difficult to infer protein function only by sequence analysis.

in order to obtain evidence that the product of these three genes coding either for full length or partial pld-family proteins are important for bacterial survival in vivo, we checked by rt-pcr for their mrna expression. we observed that these genes are expressed both in bacteria grown for four hours in trypto casein soy broth  medium, as well as in the lungs of mice infected for 24 hours . these results prompted us to further check for a putative involvement of the full length pld gene, called pld <dig>  on k. pneumoniae virulence.

involvement of the phospholipase d family protein gene pld <dig> in kp  <dig>  virulence
as pld-family proteins have been shown to be involved in virulence  <cit> , we decided to characterize the role of the full length pld <dig> protein. we first tested a pld mutant strain in a k. pneumoniae murine model. mice were infected intranasally with  <dig> of either the wild-type bacteria, a pld <dig> mutant, or the mutant strain complemented with a plasmid expressing the putative pld <dig> protein , and their survival was monitored for seven days. interestingly, the mutant strain appeared avirulent in a mouse model of acute pneumonia while mice infected with the wild-type and the complemented strain succumbed in less than one week . however, the wild-type, the mutant and the complemented mutant strains grew equally well in luria-bertani broth  broth . these results indicated that the pld <dig> mutant was strongly attenuated in vivo, thus showing an important role for pld <dig> in virulence.

to analyze the frequency and clonal distribution of the pld <dig> gene in k. pneumoniae, the  <dig> genomes were analyzed using blastn. we observed that besides st <dig>  represented by strain kp <dig> , pld <dig> was present in  <dig> strains  belonging to st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  but in none of the other isolates. it is interesting to note that st <dig> was associated with severe k. pneumoniae infections  <cit>  and that k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis is the only klebsiella strain to be able to survive intracellularly in macrophages  <cit> .

functional characterization of pld1
in order to demonstrate the phospholipase activity of pld <dig> and characterize its involvement in lipid metabolism, the lipid composition of wild-type and mutant strains was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography . a remarkable lipid spot was absent from the pld <dig> mutant in comparison with the complemented strain, suggesting that the putative pld <dig> is involved in lipid metabolism . to reinforce this result, a plasmid carrying the pld <dig> gene was inserted into e. coli strain sd <dig>  <cit> . this strain is deficient in phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin, thus presenting a simpler lipid composition than its parental strain and kp <dig> . lipid profiles of sd <dig> and complemented strains had a different lipid composition. notably, the pld1-expressing strain contained an additional lipid spot in comparison to the sd <dig> strain, suggesting that pld <dig> is responsible for this difference . sd <dig> wild-type strain also presented an extra lipid spot in comparison to the pld1-expressing strain, possibly representing the pld <dig> substrate . densitometric analysis of iodine-stained lipids on tlc plates revealed that this lipid spot corresponded to 21% of the total amount of lipids in sd <dig> strain, but only 6% of sd <dig> complemented with a plasmid expressing pld <dig>  mass spectrometry  analysis of total lipid extract was carried out to identify such lipid. comparing lipid profiles by ms, we found a lipid of mass  <dig>  present only in the pld1-deficient strain  and identified it as phosphatidyl glycerol  using the lipidmaps database.

as mentioned above, the bacterial pld-family proteins can be classified in four subfamilies. one of them, the cardiolipin synthase is able to convert two pg molecules into glycerol and cardiolipin, or to catalyze the opposite reaction, leading to pg formation  <cit> . our results suggest that pld <dig> belongs to the cardiolipin synthase subfamily and that it plays a role in balancing the pg and cardiolipin content.

it has been shown that humans and mice with bacterial pneumonia have markedly elevated amounts of cardiolipin in lung fluid and that it impairs surfactant function, lung mechanics, modulation of cell survival and cytokine networks and lung consolidation  <cit> .

there is evidence that bacteria are able to adjust their relative concentrations of phosphatidylethanolamine and pgs when subjected to environmental stresses. such an alteration in headgroup composition seems to be a means for changing membrane permeability and, hence, preserving stability  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that pld <dig> alters the membrane composition and charge, affecting bacterial interaction with the host environment.

recently, russel el. al. demonstrated that diverse phospholipase proteins encoded within the t6ss loci of several prokaryotic genomes are antibacterial effectors, conferring competitive advantages on the donor strain during interbacterial interactions  <cit> . these proteins are generally designated as ‘t6ss lipase effectors’  and classified in five sub-families, according to the sequence conservation and number of catalytic motifs present. kp <dig>  pld-family protein could be considered a tle <dig> member, as it presents two conserved hxkxxxxd motifs. however, in the kp <dig>  genome we did not identify any gene similar to the cognate immunity genes - a hallmark of the genomic islands described by russel et al. moreover, we did not observe such an antibacterial effect of kp <dig>  or its pld <dig> mutant strain upon competition with e. coli . these results showed that pld <dig> is implicated in virulence without being an anti-bacterial factor and is, so far, unique.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents a comparative analysis of the complete genome sequence of the high virulence reference strain kp <dig> , a derivative of the k <dig> reference strain b <dig>  it revealed five genomic regions possibly involved in bacterial virulence. one gene, pld <dig>  was shown to be involved in virulence in a mouse model of pneumonia and revealed a novel implication of lipid metabolism in k. pneumoniae pathogenesis. future analysis of additional putative virulence factors such as sel <dig> lipoproteins, vgrg, hcp, bcl, comp and sefir-domain containing protein are required for a comprehensive understanding of k. pneumoniae core virulence genes.
