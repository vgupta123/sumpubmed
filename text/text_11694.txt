BACKGROUND
pigmentation is a tractable phenotypic trait that can be easily quantified, and shows remarkable inter- and intra-specific variation. differences in pigmentation are the most apparent trait that often distinguishes natural populations of a species and/or closely-related species . pigmentation has received considerable attention both in the context of speciation and adaptation . therefore, pigmentation represents a manageable case for studying molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary processes. much effort was invested in recent years to identify genetic pathways that determine pigmentation variations in humans and in natural animal populations that revealed a substantial conservation in the pathways controlling pigmentation in vertebrates  <cit> , with several genes associated with variations in mammal pigmentation that share the same function in teleost fish, such as kit, mc1r, oca <dig>  scl24a, sox <dig>  mitf, and ednrb
 <cit> .

teleost fish are characterized by the existence of further pigmentation cells in addition to melanocytes . these are xanthophores , erythrophores , leucophores , iridophores  and cyanophores   <cit> . orange to red pigmentation can originate from carotenoids and broadly discussed as a marker of phenotypic quality or dietary history or endogenous pteridines . a very common color variant in captive ornamental teleost species is the so-called "gold" or "orange" variant in which the melanophore density is reduced and the xanthophores become dominant giving the animals a yellow-orange color. a similar natural pattern is observed in lake malawi cichlids and is controlled by regulatory elements in the pax <dig> locus  <cit> . in midas cichlids, pigmentation may change in the course of ontogeny giving rise to the gold morph, and a recent transcriptomic study identified genes regulated during this transition  <cit> .

the african teleost nothobranchius furzeri is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be cultured in captivity and was recently introduced as a model organism in the context of aging research. a reference transcriptome for n. furzeri was recently generated  <cit> . n. furzeri is characterized by a striking dichromatism with two phenotypes: a "yellow-tail" morph that shows a yellow submarginal band and a black marginal band , and a "red-tail" morph with a broad red marginal band. these two morphs coexist over a broad portion of the distribution range in southern mozambique, with the yellow morph predominating in the margin of the distribution range  <cit> . the two morphs are not genetically differentiated implying the absence of assortative mating  <cit> . the sister taxon to n. furzeri is n. kadleci
 <cit> , with parapatric distribution and showing a solid red tail. previous crossing studies have revealed that dichromatism in n. furzeri is inherited as a simple mendelian trait with the yellow morph dominant over the red morph  <cit> . the causative genetic variation was mapped by linkage analysis in a chromosome region containing the mc1r locus, but subsequent mapping of an mc1r marker showed that the gene is most likely not responsible for the color difference in n. furzeri
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

a: the yellow morph of n. furzeri has a spotted tail with a sub-marginal yellow band and a marginal black band . n. kadleci have a solid red tail in general and sometimes with bluish spots in the proximal region. b: corresponding yellow and red tail portions were clipped for rna isolation. c: the yellow band of n. furzeri contains the yellow xanthophores almost exclusively, whereas the corresponding portions in n. kadleci have the black melanophores and red erythrophores . d: hierarchical clustering of expression profiles derived from four rna-seq pools of yellow  and four pools of red  tail samples. the profiles of samples correspond with the yellow and red tail phenotypic categories.



in the present paper, we used rna-seq to identify genes differentially expressed in the yellow vs. red morphs of n. furzeri and n. kadleci.

RESULTS
tail expression profiles correspond with dichromatism
to make sure that genetic mechanisms of tail pigmentation are identical in the two species, we performed a complementation test by crossing individuals of the mzm- <dig> red-tailed strain of n. furzeri
 <cit>  with those of n. kadleci in both possible combinations of parents. all 24 f <dig> male offspring from the two crosses showed a red tail supporting the assumption that the same locus is associated with red colour in both species.

in order to identify differences in gene expression between the two colour morphs that are independent of the genetic background, we used a f <dig> hybrid panel obtained by crossing a yellow-tailed male of the n. furzeri strain grz with a female n. kadleci. a clear segregation of the two phenotypes was observed in f <dig> generation  confirming the mendelian inheritance of this trait  <cit> . at the age of 16 weeks, the yellow submarginal band of the caudal fin and the corresponding region of red-tailed fish were excised taking care of excluding the black marginal band . four rna pools of each colour morph  were analyzed by illumina rna-seq resulting in  <dig> , <dig> reads  having an average of around  <dig> million reads per sample pool. about 55% of the reads could be mapped to the reference transcriptome of n. furzeri. hierarchical clustering of the reads showed that the samples group in correspondence with the yellow and red phenotypic categories . in total,  <dig> differentially-expressed genes  were identified by the intersection of the statistical tests in the packages edger and deseq . of the  <dig> degs,  <dig> were up regulated, while  <dig> were down-regulated in the yellow samples with respect to the red samples. a full list of degs is provided in additional file  <dig>  project data are deposited in the short reads archive , reference number srp <dig> 

in order to confirm the expression changes detected by rna-seq we performed qpcr for four sample genes selected on the basis of fold change  or known role in pigmentation biology: esrrga , tyr , pax <dig> , and sox <dig> . estrogen-related receptor gamma a  was the gene with highest fold change in yellow samples, tyrosinase  is a rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme of melanin, and the transcription factors pax <dig> and sox <dig> are important in the differentiation of melanocytes  <cit> . in all four cases, the direction of change was consistent between the two methods . thus, as already shown  <cit> , we found coherence between rna-seq and qpcr.figure  <dig> 
rt-qpcr validation of sample genes regulated in rna-seq data. four sample genes were selected based on fold change or known role in melanocyte biology . the same individuals whose expression was quantified with rna-seq were used in qpcr. expression was normalized to tbp, as internal control; error bars represent standard deviation.



melanogenesis is the main process regulated between morphs
to assess which biological processes may be modulated by the degs, gene ontology  analysis was performed. lists of genes with significantly different transcript levels were analyzed with the functional annotation clustering  tool implemented in the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit> . fac allows clustering of go categories sharing significant amount of genes and partially obviates to redundancy of go classes by providing a more compact output than conventional go enrichment analysis. the fac analysis of  <dig> higher expressed genes resulted into  <dig> enriched functional clusters under the high stringency option. fac <dig>  was the most biologically important gene group with enrichment score of  <dig>  . melanin biosynthetic process  was the most significant biological process  in yellow tails . fac analysis of the  <dig> lower expressed genes yielded  <dig> enriched functional gene groups. muscle components and organization were the most significant biological processes, such as z disc , myofibril , and contractile fibre part  .figure  <dig>

fac <dig> revealed five pigmentation genes  with fold-change range of  <dig>  –  <dig>  . tyr, tyrp <dig> and dct are members of the tyrosinase gene family that arose by ancient duplications and catalyse conversion of amino acid tyrosine to melanin <cit> . deletions in oca <dig> were shown to be responsible for parallel evolution of albinism in the mexican cave fish  <cit> . sox <dig> in together with mitf regulate melanocyte differentiation by activating tyr
 <cit> . the remaining fac clusters of up-regulated genes were dominated by solute carrier and channel genes including slc24a <dig>  presumably a cation exchanger linked with variations in number, size and density of melanosomes in humans and zebrafish  <cit> . muscle-related processes featured prominently in the fac clusters with lower transcript levels . cluster  <dig> included xdh ,  <dig> -fold lower expressed which is a key enzyme in the synthesis of pteridine pigments. this gene group also contained solute carrier protein genes including ano <dig> . under relaxed clustering stringency, mreg  was also observed.

the enrichment of melanogenesis-related terms with respect to higher expression in yellow fish suggests that melanocytes are found more often in yellow- with respect to red-tailed fish. however, tail micrographs  surprisingly showed that the yellow submarginal band actually lacked melanocytes, which were abundant in corresponding red tail regions. this suggests that the xanthophores were connected with melanogenesis, thus indicating that xanthophores are functionally more related to the melanocytes and most likely ontogenetically closer to the melanocyte lineage than to the erythrophores. indeed, studies have reported on the role of pax3/pax <dig> fate switch to myogenesis  <cit>  in which pro-myogenesis hedgehog and fgf <dig> signalling suppress pax3/pax <dig>  and promote myogenic regulatory factors. a further study on the role of pax <dig> and pax <dig> genes in the zebrafish neural crest  <cit>  demonstrated sequential actions of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in fate switch induction from xanthophores to melanophores in pax <dig> knock-down embryos. higher expression of xdh in the red-tail samples indicates that the red pigment is pteridine-based. both sepiapterin and drosopterin are formed from 6-pyruvoyl-h4pterin, and xdh is required for the formation of yellow pigments from sepiapterin  <cit> . however, the pathway leading to the formation of the orange-red pigments from drosopterin is yet to be elucidated. the regulation of xdh in this study may suggest a possible role of this gene in nothobranchius tail pigmentation.

regulation of muscle genes in midas cichlids
regulation of genes in the melanin synthetic pathway is an expected finding. a surprising observation is the regulation of muscle-related genes. the tail is a heterogeneous source of rna, containing various other cells  in addition to pigment cells. we compared observed differences between nothobranchius colour morphs with expression changes observed in the midas cichlids in relation to transition from the grey to the gold morph  <cit>  and identified  <dig> genes with consistent expression changes in the two species . it is interesting that just a handful of muscle genes were regulated, and that muscle genes were regulated in both nothobranchius and midas.table  <dig>

we noted above the role of known colour genes  in muscle development. pax <dig> plays key roles in melanocyte development , and melanoma by maintaining a less differentiated ‘stem’ cell-like phenotype  <cit> . further, a cis-regulatory mutation in pax <dig> drives the differentiation of the orange-blotch phenotype from the common male nuptial colouration in lake malawi cichlids  <cit> . similarly, the intensity of coat colour is reduced in mice lacking myosine heavy chain genes such as myo5a  due to loss of connections between melanosomes and f-actin which affect melanosome distribution in the cell  <cit> . it would be worthwhile to analyze gene expression at the embryonic stage when cell fate specification and differentiation is still underway. the challenge though would be in distinguishing embryo colour morphs given that the manner and timing in which erythrophores and xanthophores differentiate from their precursor is not understood. taken together, these observations and our results suggest a possible link between the pigmentation and mayogenic pathways in nothobranchius. presently, the functional significance of these genes for red pigmentation remains unknown and forms an interesting perspective for the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this study successfully identified pigmentation as the major biological process altered between tail colour morphs consistent with knowledge in other species. our results therefore show that n. furzeri is a genetically-tractable species for studying the genetic basis of natural phenotypic variations, not only through classical linkage methods as in  <cit> , but also amenable to modern hi-tech genomic approaches. thus, the current list of differentially-expressed genes can feed back to, and be compared with the results of fine-mapping of the colour locus that is ongoing, to reveal the genetic architecture of this natural phenotype.
