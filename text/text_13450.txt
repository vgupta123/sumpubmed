BACKGROUND

helicobacter pylori is a well-known gastric pathogen which causes gastroduodenal inflammation, peptic ulceration and gastric cancer  <cit> . h. pylori infection induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin -1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor -α  resulting in gastric inflammation characterized by the infiltration of plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes within gastric mucosa  <cit> . il- <dig> secreted by gastric epithelial cells is a potent neutrophil-activating and chemotactic agent  <cit>  which plays a major role in triggering the mucosal inflammation caused by h. pylori . increased levels of il- <dig> in gastric juice and biopsy samples have been reported in patients with h. pylori infection  <cit> . in addition, the levels of il- <dig> mrna in the gastric mucosa of h. pylori-infected patients correlate significantly with the severity of gastritis  <cit>  and the risk of gastric cancer  <cit> .

symptomatic subjects diagnosed with h. pylori infection generally receive eradication therapy. however, bacterial resistance to antibiotics and side effects which contribute to poor patient compliance result in suboptimal eradication rates  <cit> . probiotics have been shown to confer beneficial effects and are recommended as an adjunct in the treatment of h. pylori  <cit> . suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by gastric epithelial cells is a mechanism of probiotic action which has been shown by numerous reports  <cit>  and considered as an approach to prevent gastric cancer  <cit> . l. salivarius ucc <dig> inhibited h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production of ags gastric epithelial cell by decreasing the function of the cag secretion system  <cit> . l. acidophilus la5® was shown to reduce il- <dig> production induced by h. pylori in mkn <dig> gastric epithelial cells by inactivating the smad <dig> and nuclear factor- kappa b  pathways  <cit> . moreover, l. gasseri oll <dig>  was found to suppress h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production in mkn <dig> gastric epithelial cells and decrease the level of il- <dig> in the gastric mucosa of h. pylori-infected patients  <cit> . we previously reported eight isolates of lactobacillus spp. which inhibited il- <dig> secretion from h. pylori-infected ags cells  <cit> . among these lactobacilli, l. salivarius b <dig>  l. rhamnosus b <dig> and l. plantarum xb <dig> suppressed il- <dig> mrna expression and the activation of nf-κb whereas l. plantarum xb <dig> also suppressed c-jun activation. l. salivarius b <dig>  l. salivarius b <dig> and the other three strains inhibited the secretion of il- <dig> but did not interfere with il- <dig> gene transcription after co-culture for 4 h with ags cells.

in this study, we characterized the mechanism by which the previously identified l. salivarius b <dig> and b <dig> strains suppress il- <dig> production from h. pylori-induced gastric epithelial cells. we hypothesized that l. salivarius b <dig> and b <dig> may suppress il- <dig> gene expression at other time points or affect il- <dig> production post-transcriptionally or post-translationally. the results of this present study demonstrated that l. salivarius b <dig> and l. salivarius b <dig> produce distinct active components that inhibit nf-κb activation and suppress downstream transcription of h. pylori-induced il- <dig> mrna.

RESULTS
gastric-derived l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> suppress il- <dig> production in h. pylori-induced ags cells

l. salivarius b <dig>  and l. salivarius b <dig>  are different strains as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna  and repetitive-sequence-based pcr  fingerprinting . l. salivarius b <dig> , which does not suppress il- <dig>  was included as a negative control. immunomodulatory activity of substances from lactobacillus conditioned media  was investigated by co-incubation with ags cells either alone or in combination with viable h. pylori atcc  <dig>  lcm of both ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> significantly  suppressed il- <dig> production in h. pylori-stimulated ags cells, where lcm of ls-b <dig> did not suppress il- <dig> production as expected . trypan blue dye exclusion  indicated that il- <dig> suppression by ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> was not due to cytotoxicity on ags cells. lcm from ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> did not stimulate il- <dig> production when co-incubated with ags cells in the absence of h. pylori . in addition, 5 % v/v lcm in rpmi medium did not inhibit the growth of h. pylori .fig.  <dig> specific strains of gastric-derived l. salivarius suppress il- <dig> production by h. pylori-induced ags cells. lcm from three strains of l. salivarius were tested for the ability to suppress il- <dig> production from ags cells stimulated by h. pylori. ags cells were incubated with lcm in the presence or absence of h. pylori atcc <dig> for 24 h and il- <dig> secretion was measured by elisa. the results were from three independent experiments in triplicate and expressed as the mean ± sem, ***p <  <dig>  as compared to medium control




secreted factors from l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> diminished il- <dig> gene expression
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  was used to determine the effect of lcm on il- <dig> gene transcription. since it was previously shown that lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> did not suppress il- <dig> transcription after co-incubation with ags cells for 4 h  <cit> , the suppressive effect of these lcm was tested further at various time points. h. pylori-stimulated ags cells were treated with lcm for  <dig>   <dig> and 6 h prior to total rna isolation. il- <dig> gene expression at 2 h, relative to gapdh, was significantly down-regulated approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold with the treatment of lcm from ls-b <dig>  and ls-b <dig> , respectively. unexpectedly, lcm from ls-b <dig> also down-regulated il- <dig> gene expression approximately  <dig>  fold  at 4 h. in addition, lcm from both strains did not affect il- <dig> gene expression at 6 h .fig.  <dig> 
l. salivarius-produced factors suppress il- <dig> transcription in ags cells. il- <dig> gene expression was determined in h. pylori-induced ags cells after incubation with medium control or lcm from l. salivarius. gene expression was examined using qrt-pcr with primers specific to il- <dig> and gapdh transcripts. quantitative gene expression data were normalized to housekeeping gene, gapdh. the experiments were performed three times independently, each in triplicate. fold change of il- <dig> gene expression was calculated in relative to medium control, and results represent the mean ± sem, ***p <  <dig>  as compared to medium control




secreted factors from l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> inhibit nf-κb activation

h. pylori induces various signaling pathways resulting in phosphorylation of transcription factors nf-κb and activator protein- <dig>  and downstream transcription of il- <dig> in gastric epithelial cells . to determine the effect of immunomodulatory substances produced by ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> on the activation of nf-κb and ap- <dig>  the concentrations of phosphorylated subunits p <dig>  and c-jun  were assayed by western blot. h. pylori-stimulated ags cells were treated with lcm from either ls-b <dig> or ls-b <dig> for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and 3 h. treatment of lcm from ls-b <dig> decreased the concentration of p-nf-κb p <dig> at 15 min  and no significant effects were found at other time points. treatment with ls-b <dig> lcm resulted in a significant decrease in p-nf-κb p <dig>  only at 2 h. in contrast, lcm from both strains did not suppress p-c-jun at any studied time point .fig.  <dig> 
l. salivarius strains suppress h. pylori-activated nf-κb in ags gastric epithelial cells. h. pylori-stimulated ags cells were incubated with medium control or lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and 3 h. concentration of activated nf-κb were measured by western blot analysis using antibodies to p-nf-κb p <dig> and nf-κb p <dig>  relative protein concentration was quantified by densitometry and activated transcription factor  was normalized to non-activated counterpart . the results were from three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± sem, **p <  <dig>  as compared to medium control




the immunomodulatory substances in lcm of l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> are heat-stable and larger than 100 kda
heat treatment and size fractionation of lcm were performed in order to characterize the physical nature of the il- <dig> inhibitory substances. lcm from ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> were heated to 100 °c for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and 2 h and assayed for il- <dig> suppression by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . heat-treated lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> at all time retained inhibitory activity of h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production in ags cells when compared with mrs control .fig.  <dig> il- <dig> suppression by heat-treated and fractionated lcm of l. salivarius. lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> were either heat treated  or fractionated by using amicon centrifugal filter  and tested for the suppression of il- <dig> production using a quantikine human il- <dig> immunoassay. the results were from three independent experiments in triplicate and expressed as the mean ± sem, ***p <  <dig>  as compared to medium control




amicon® centrifugal filters  were used to size fractionate ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> lcm and each fraction was tested for inhibitory activity on h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production. fractions containing substances >100 kda significantly suppressed il- <dig> production as compared with mrs control , whereas those containing substances <3 kda, <50 kda, and <100 kda did not suppress h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production .

enzyme sensitivity of the immunomodulatory substances in lcm of l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> indicates differences in chemical nature
to determine the chemical nature of il- <dig> inhibitory substances in ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> lcm, treatments with α-amylase, lipase, proteinase k, trypsin, and lysozyme were performed. lcm from ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> were incubated with each of these enzymes for 6 h and then tested for h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production. treatment of ls-b <dig> lcm with α-amylase abolished il- <dig> suppression as compared to media control  and non-treated lcm , while treatment with lipase, proteinase k, trypsin, and lysozyme did not affect il- <dig> suppression . treatment of ls-b <dig> lcm with either α-amylase or proteinase k resulted in the loss of il- <dig> inhibitory activity as compared to media control  and non-treated lcm . the treatment with lipase or trypsin affected il- <dig> suppression of ls-b <dig> lcm by 4-fold as compared to non-treated lcm  although ls-b <dig> lcm retained some suppression of il- <dig> production that was statistically different from media control . no effect on il- <dig> suppression was detected when ls-b <dig> lcm was treated with lysozyme . these results suggest that the inhibitory substance of ls-b <dig> is polysaccharide, whereas the one of ls-b <dig> is complex consisting of components of polysaccharide, protein and lipid. on the other hand, ls-b <dig> may produce multiple immunomodulating substances like glycoproteins or lipoproteins. as lysozyme had no effect on il- <dig> suppression by lcm from either strain, the peptidoglycan of these lactobacilli is most likely not involved.fig.  <dig> enzyme sensitivity of the immunomodulatory substances in lcm of l. salivarius. substances in lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> were incubated with enzymes α-amylase, lipase, lysozyme, proteinase k and trypsin and the effect on il- <dig> production was tested using a quantikine human il- <dig> immunoassay. the experiments were performed three times in triplicate and the results represented the mean ± sem, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  as compared to medium control, ###

discussion
persistent colonization of h. pylori results in chronic inflammation which predisposes infected people to severe peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer  <cit> . among several factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are the main mediators of mucosal inflammation and damage  <cit> . il- <dig> is a key chemokine in neutrophil infiltration  <cit>  that is associated with disease severity  <cit>  and considered a potential prognostic and predictive cancer biomarker  <cit> . in fact, whole genome analysis of h. pylori-exposed ags gastric epithelial cells revealed that after a 3 h exposure il- <dig> is the single most up-regulated gene among >  <dig>  genes tested  <cit> .

specific strains of lactobacillus have been shown to diminish h. pylori-induced il- <dig> production in vitro and in vivo . we have identified anti-inflammatory lactobacillus spp. which suppress il- <dig> secretion by h. pylori-induced ags cells. among these strains, it is interesting that l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> did not suppress il- <dig> gene transcription at 4 h of co-culture  <cit> . it was previously reported that l. casei vsl# <dig> suppressed tnf-induced secretion of the t-cell chemokine interferon-inducible protein  secretion by mode-k intestinal epithelial cells without inhibiting ip- <dig> gene transcription. study of the mechanism underlying this observation revealed that l. casei impairs vesicular pathways important for the secretion of ip- <dig> and the chemokine is subsequently degraded  <cit> . in an attempt to characterize the mechanism involved in the suppression of il- <dig> secretion by ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig>  we first investigated the effect on il- <dig> gene expression by lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> at various time points. our data demonstrated that both lcm reduced il- <dig> gene expression as early as a 2 h co-culture and the reduction by ls-b <dig> lcm continued at 4 h. interference with il- <dig> gene expression by probiotic microbes has been reported to occur at different time points of co-culture. l. gasseri oll <dig>  inhibited h. pylori-induced il- <dig> gene expression by mkn <dig> gastric epithelial cells only at 6 h of co-culture  <cit> . on the contrary, saccharomyces boulardii reduced il-1β-induced il- <dig> mrna levels in ht- <dig> colonic epithelial cells at all time points studied from  <dig>  to 4 h  <cit> . this study also demonstrated that lcm from ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> suppressed the activation of nf-κb at different time points  but did not interfere with p-c-jun activation. it has been demonstrated that il- <dig> gene transcription in gastric epithelial cells requires the activation of both nf-κb and ap- <dig>  <cit> , and a mutation in the il- <dig> gene at the nf-κb binding site alone results in the inhibition of il- <dig> gene expression  <cit> . therefore, suppression of only nf-κb activation by lcm of ls-b <dig> and ls-b <dig> should be sufficient for inhibiting il- <dig> production by these lactobacilli. anti-inflammatory l. salivarius b <dig> and l. rhamnosus b <dig> were also shown to suppress only p-nf-κb activated by h. pylori but the suppression occurred at various time points  <cit> .

with an increase in the interest of anti-inflammatory lactobacillus for h. pylori treatment, the molecular nature of immunomodulating substances has been investigated in lactobacillus spp. among several factors influencing host immune response, exopolysaccharides, which are extracellular polysaccharides attached to the bacterial cell surface or secreted into the extracellular environment, have been recognized to influence immune signaling  <cit> . in this study, the il-8-suppressing substance in lcm of ls-b <dig> was a heat-stable, α-amylase -sensitive factor with a molecular size >100 kda suggesting the production of an immunomodulatory exopolysaccharide by ls-b <dig>  exopolysaccharides of beneficial bacteria have long been shown to act as immunomodulating agents and their contributions to immune stimulation and immune suppression have been investigated in various aspects. soluble polysaccharides with molecular weights between  <dig> and 2460 kda of bifidobacterium adolescentis m101- <dig> were found to stimulate the proliferation of murine splenocytes, suggesting their immunomodulation activity  <cit> . polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex derived from lactobacillus casei strain shirota inhibited the release of il- <dig> in lps-stimulated large intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells isolated from mice with chronic colitis and in raw <dig>  cells in vitro  <cit> . pretreatment of exopolysaccharides obtained from bifidobacterium longum bcrc  <dig> suppressed lps-induced cell growth inhibition and release of tnf-α from j774a. <dig> macrophages  <cit> . exopolysaccharides with molecular weights ≤ 70 kda obtained from the culture medium of lactobacillus confusus tistr  <dig> were observed to induce the production of nitric oxide and cytokines tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> through the activation of nf-κb and jnk pathways  <cit> . in addition, an exopolysaccaride of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg alleviated inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α in lps-induced ipec-j <dig> porcine intestinal epithelial cells at mrna level by attenuation of mapk and nf-kb signaling activations  <cit> .

on the contrary to ls-b <dig>  ls-b <dig> lcm is sensitive to α-amylase, lipase, proteinase k and trypsin albeit with different magnitudes. it is probable that immunomodulatory substance in lcm of ls-b <dig> is complex consisting of components of polysaccharide, protein and lipid. however, our result could not exclude the possibility that ls-b <dig> produces multiple immunomodulatory substances such as glycoproteins and lipoproteins. bacterial glycoproteins have been identified  <cit>  and secreted glycoproteins were reported in l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  <cit>  and l. rhamnosus gg  <cit> . glycoproteins of l. plantarum wcfs <dig> are thought to be recognized by the dc-specific icam-3-grabbing non-integrin  receptor and thereby eliciting specific cytokine production and immune responses in immature human dendritic cells  <cit> . anti-inflammatory activity of cell-associated glycoprotein was recently reported in l. plantarum l <dig> for the protection of inflammation caused by cadmium ion in raw  <dig>  cells by suppressing the expression of ap- <dig> , mitogen-activated protein kinases , and inducible nitric oxide synthase  <cit> . the immunomodulatory effect of bacterial lipoprotein  was also demonstrated in e. coli nissle  <dig> in that blp acts like the conditioned medium in the modulation of t-cell cycle progression by binding to toll-like receptor- <dig> which may downregulate the expansion of newly recruited t cells into the mucosa and limit intestinal inflammation  <cit> .

the structure and composition of polysaccharides and other biological substances are diverse among microbes and this variation may contribute to the different immunomodulation of host immune responses. although we have not performed purification of bioactive substances, our initial characterization suggests the nature of different anti-inflammatory substances produced by ls-b37and ls-b <dig>  further studies are required to determine the exact molecular nature and function of these substances in the modulation of immune response to h. pylori infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have provided evidence that human gastric-derived l. salivarius strains b <dig> and b <dig> produce anti-inflammatory substances that suppress il- <dig> production by h. pylori-induced ags cells through the attenuation of nf-κb activation. large, heat-stable bioactive substances produced by these two strains differ in enzymatic sensitivity. the immunomodulatory substance of l. salivarius b <dig> is similar to a polysaccharide, while that of ls-b <dig> is more structurally complex or includes multiple components such as glycoprotein and lipoprotein. these lactobacilli have potential as probiotics and their immunomodulatory substances may be pharmacologic agents for treatment of h. pylori-associated diseases.
