BACKGROUND
gene therapy protocols would strongly benefit from the development of a one step technique that would allow cells to be genetically modified through the introduction of several therapeutic genes. in order to induce the translation and expression of exogenous cdnas, carried by a single vector, researchers have cloned internal ribosomal entry sites  upstream from these exogenous cdnas. this approach should lead to the translation of three cistrons from an unique mrna and therefore to the consequent expression of the three encoded proteins  <cit> .

in most cases, the ires from emcv is cloned into polycistronic vectors as it induces high levels of dna translation  <cit> . the capacity of other ireses to induce high levels of exogenous cdna expression in different cell types has been compared to the capacity of the emcv ires  <cit> . however, in most cases, these comparisons were carried out after different ireses had been inserted into a single, characterized, dicistronic  or tricistronic  mrna and after the in vitro vector translation efficiency had been established  <cit> . these studies are useful in choosing the ires that will drive the in vivo expression of heterologous proteins, they do, however, give little information as to the potential in vivo interactions that occur between different iress cloned into the same mulv-based retroviral vector.

we cloned tricistronic vectors encoding three different cdnas. this involved using at least two ireses to translate the second and third cistrons. using the same ires twice in a single vector could, however, induce recombination events and the loss of the second ires and cistron. in the same way, using the same cistron twice could lead to a competition between the two iress for the binding to cell type specific translation factors. for these reasons, we chose to clone and compare the efficiency of different ireses cloned into the same vector. we chose the ires of emcv , the ires of the c-myc proto-oncogene , the ires of fgf- <dig>  and the ires of the htlv- <dig> lentivirus   <cit> . the vectors were constructed so that the third cistron was translated from the iresemcv and the second cistron was translated from the iresemcv, iresc-myc,, iresfgf- <dig> or ireshtlv- <dig> 

recently, it has been shown that retroviral vectors derived from mulv contain an additional ires on the 5' gag sequence  <cit> . the vectors described here contained three ireses: the ires from mulv located between the ltr and the psi sequence controlling the translation of the first cistron, the ires from a different origin and the ires from emcv respectively controlling the translation of the second and third cistrons . the exogenous genes cloned into the tricistronic vectors were chosen for their potential use in clinical trials. they code for co-stimulatory molecules known to enhance tumor cell immunogenicity: cd <dig>  a member of the b <dig> family and cd <dig>  a member of the tnf family  <cit> . these molecules act in synergy to enhance the induction of ag-mediated anti-tumor immunity when co-expressed with tumor antigens  <cit> . we generated retroviral vectors that encoded the two co-stimulatory molecules cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and a selection gene. we compared the efficacy of these vectors in their capacity to genetically modify various human and murine cells, and also observed how they affected the selection and culture of these cells following transduction. we then compared the expression of the three exogenous genes within the genetically modified cells. murine melanoma cells were then tested in two different murine tumor models for their ability to induce an in vivo anti-tumor immune response, regardless of the percentage of co-stimulatory molecules expressed by the transduced cells.

RESULTS
construction of tricistronic retroviral vectors expressing cd <dig> and cd80
we constructed tricistronic vectors that would induce the expression of three cdnas  from one promoter  . the constructions are described in the methods. expression of the first open reading frame  occurs from one ires  located at the 5' extremity of the mrna. the second and third open reading frames are translated from two identical or two different ireses. tfgemcvneo or tfgemcvzeo were constructed so that the translation of the selection gene and the second co-stimulatory molecule could be induced from two identical iresemcv . tfghtlv- <dig>  tfgc-myc and tfgfgf- <dig> were constructed to allow the expression of the selection gene from ireshtlv- <dig>  iresc-myc or iresfgf- <dig> while the translation of the third open reading frame was under the control of iresemcv .

efficiency of the different ireses in inducing the expression of the selection gene  in different cell types
we generated retroviral vectors using the different plasmids described in figure  <dig> and transfected ψcrip cells or triple-transfected the 293t packaging cell line. we obtained viable g <dig> or zeocin-resistant ψcrip cells after transfection with tfgemcvneo, tfgemcvzeo, tfghtlv-1zeo, tfghtlv-1neo, tfgfgf-2zeo or tfgfgf-2neo but none after transfection with tfgcmyczeo or tfgcmycneo. we tested the supernatants from ψcrip or 293t transfected cell suspensions for the presence of replication competent retroviruses  through the dosage of reverse transcriptase activity. the supernatants from all the transfected packaging cells were free of reverse transcriptase activity. the titers of the different retroviruses produced different results, depending on the experiments, varying from  <dig> to  <dig> particles/ml. we used  <dig> particles of each type of retrovirus that was produced  or the  <dig> hour supernatants from transiently transfected tfgcmyczeo ψcrip or 293t cells to transduce different types of mammalian cells. the murine cells used were either nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts or b <dig> f <dig> melanoma cells. to establish a human model, we cultured melanoma cells from biopsies as described in the methods. during the course of this study we obtained  <dig> melanoma biopsies. fifteen cell cultures were obtained from these biopsies which represents a yield of  <dig> %. the quality and characteristics of the melanoma cells were determined by immunohistochemistry, on cytospin cells, using anti-cytokeratin  , anti-s <dig> protein, anti-melana/mart <dig> and anti-hmb-45/gp <dig> antibody staining as described in the methods. the  <dig> human cell cultures obtained all stemmed from melanoma cells .

the transduced cells were selected for their resistance to g <dig> or zeocin. fifteen days after the transduction with each retroviral vector, we selected g <dig> or zeocin-resistant cells. apart from the tfgcmyczeo transduced cells, we obtained roughly the same number of zeocin or g <dig> resistant clones with the different retroviral constructs. both murine and human cells could be successfully genetically modified using the engineered trigenic retroviral vectors. no vector was statistically more efficient in obtaining a higher yield of resistant clones. however, the tfgemcvzeo, tfgfgf-2zeo and tfghtlv-1zeo cells were long lasting, viable and could be expanded, whereas neither murine nor human tfgcmyczeo transfected cells displayed long-term viability.

the selected genetically modified cells expressed co-stimulatory molecule mrnas
cells were stably transduced with mfg derived vectors encoding cd <dig>  cd <dig> and an antibiotic resistance gene. after selection with the appropriate antibiotics , the stably transduced cells were analyzed for the expression of the different mrnas, by rt-pcr using specific primers. the aim of the rt-pcr analysis was to show, through the expression of the full length rna, that successful transcription of the construct had been achieved. we were uncertain whether the transcription of the ectopic dna was complete. rt-pcr analysis was performed using cells that were resistant to zeocin. we are convinced that the mrna transcribed from the ectopic dna contains the ires zeocin cassettes. as we can noticed in figure 2a, the primers used for pcr analysis n° <dig> and  <dig> overlapped. they hybridized with the sequence corresponding to the zeo gene. our hypothesis is that if we can amplify the two segments of the construction  at the same time from the ectopic rna, then the full length rna had been transcribed. we have already performed other rt-pcr analyses using this the long ranger taq polymerase from applied . we have been able to amplify full length rna from all constructs . taken together our data strongly suggests that the full length rna was transcribed from all the viral constructs.

these rt-pcr results suggest that there was no downregulation of cd <dig> or cd <dig> expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

the selected genetically modified cells expressed the co-stimulatory molecules at different levels
the cell populations were tested for co-stimulatory molecule expression by flow cytometry using abs that were directed against cd <dig> and cd <dig>  within a given population, a large percentage of cells expressed the two co-stimulatory molecules in a stable manner and at high levels. figure 3f shows the results of the flow cytometric analysis of human melanoma cells transduced with tfgfgf-2zeo. figure  <dig> is representative of the cytometric analyses carried out on the murine b <dig> f <dig> melanoma cells transduced with  <dig> hr supernatants of 293t cells transfected with the  <dig> different types of retroviral vectors. a high percentage of b <dig> f <dig> cells transduced with tfgfgf2zeo or tfghtlv-1zeo retroviral vectors  expressed both co-stimulatory molecules.

the percentage of b <dig> f <dig> cells, transduced with tfgemcvzeo or tfgc-myczeo, expressing only cd <dig> was higher than the percentage of cells expressing only cd <dig> or both molecules .

the level of expression of the two molecules differed depending on the vectors used and the cell types that were transduced, as shown in table  <dig> - see additional file  <dig> 

in theory, selected clones expressed both molecules. in fact, in any selected clone, we found cells that expressed only one of the molecules  and cells that expressed the two molecules.

murine cells
in murine cells , a high percentage of cells only expressed cd <dig>  this was not due to the expression of the cd <dig> molecule, in itself. indeed, when we used constructs with cd <dig> as the first cistron, we obtained a high percentage of cells that only expressed cd <dig>  this percentage could be attributed to a negative regulation of the translation of the third cistron.

even after the selection of transfected cells, we obtained cells which did not express detectable levels of co-stimulatory molecules. indeed, in tfghtlv-1zeo, tfgfgf-2zeo or tfgemcvzeo transduced murine nih-3t <dig> cells, we respectively found 35%, 31% or 44% of cells that expressed undetectable levels of cd <dig> or cd <dig>  expression levels were assessed regardless of the resistance gene that was used .

we tested the expression of the two co-stimulatory molecules immediately after transduction or after selection. no correlation could be established between the time of analysis and the percentage of cells expressing both molecules. one clone could be composed of a majority of cells  expressing both molecules at day  <dig> post selection, only have a small percentage of these cells at day  <dig> and up to  <dig> % on day  <dig>  indeed, even within a selected population of cells, the percentage expressing both co-stimulatory molecules could vary from  <dig> up to  <dig> % of the total cell number.

after transduction with a single vector,  <dig> clones were selected. within the same clone, some cells expressed only one co-stimulatory molecule whereas others expressed both molecules. these observations are reflected by the high sd of the percentage of cells expressing co-stimulatory molecules .

none of the vectors used were found to be adequate for the transfection of murine cells.

human cells
for human cells, we chose to use a pool of transduced cells, rather than clones, to stay as close as possible to the reality of human clinical protocols. when we used tfghtlv-1zeo  or tfghtlv-1zeo <dig>  we obtained cells that expressed only the first cistron. we obtained a better yield of cells expressing the two co-stimulatory molecules when using the tfgfgf-2zeo construct . again, even within a selected population of cells, the percentage of cells expressing both co-stimulatory molecules could vary considerably .

in human melanoma cells, the use of tricistronic vectors in which iresfgf- <dig> induced the translation of the second cistron, and iresemcv the translation of the third cistron, led to a high percentage of cells expressing the three cistrons.

expression of the tricistronic transgene slows the tumor growth rate after s.c. injection of b <dig> f <dig> in an established model
among selected cells, the percentage expressing both co-stimulatory molecules varied. we have previously shown that melanoma cells expressing high levels of cd <dig> alone or in combination with cd <dig> induced in vitro splenocyte proliferation  <cit> . using a pool of selected cells that were genetically modified by tfghtlv-1zeo , tfgfgf-2zeo , tfgemcvzeo  or double-transfected with dfg cd <dig> and dfg cd <dig> , we showed that different percentages of cells expressing both co-stimulatory molecules  could induce a proliferative response in splenocytes. a substantial increase in spleen cell proliferation was observed when the two molecules were expressed following genetic modification with all the viral vectors. this increase was similar to that induced by the use of double transfected cells .

to determine whether the local expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> could affect tumor establishment, we sub-cutaneously injected  <dig> cells, from each type of tumor, into the flanks of c57bl/ <dig> mice . these cells had previously been used in splenocyte proliferation experiments. subcutaneous injection of b <dig> f <dig> cells into b <dig> syngeneic immunocompetent mice led to the development of tumors. however, there was a delay in the appearance of tumors derived from transduced or double-transfected cells compared with tumors induced by the inoculation of parental or mock-transfected cells . although, all mice had palpable tumors before day  <dig>  the growth rate was significantly slower for tfgfgf-2zeo or tfghtlv-1zeo transduced cell tumors compared to parental cell tumors  and double transfected cell tumors  on day  <dig> . this decrease in tumor growth was less pronounced in tumors derived from cells modified by tricistronic vectors than in tumors derived from cells modified by two independent vectors. this could be due to the level of expression of the co-stimulatory molecules on the cell surface. we have previously shown that co-expression of the two co-stimulatory molecules is necessary to induce an in vivo immune response. here we show that, for the b <dig> f <dig> melanoma cell model, we had to inject as many as  <dig> ×  <dig> cells  expressing both co-stimulatory molecules to observe an immune response.

we have previously shown that the anti-tumor effect is more difficult to obtain in a mhc class i loss variant than in a mhc class i positive model  <cit> . to confirm how important the percentage of cells expressing both co-stimulatory molecules is in inducing an in vivo immune response, we transduced ts/a adenocarcinoma cells using the same retroviral vectors, as previously described. we pooled the zeocin resistant cells and chose two pools. in the first pool of cells transduced with tfgemcvzeo,  <dig> % only expressed cd <dig> and  <dig> % expressed both cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in the second pool of cells transduced with tfgfgf-2zeo,  <dig> % only expressed cd <dig> and  <dig> % expressed both cd <dig> and cd <dig>  these two pools were injected sub-cutaneously into syngeneic immunocompetent balb/c mice. these injections led, in all cases, to the development of tumors. however, when the cells were double-transfected with two independent vectors and more than  <dig> % of cells expressed both co-stimulatory molecules, most of the palpable tumors spontaneously decreased within  <dig> days. in contrast, only a delay in the appearance of the tumors derived from transduced cells could be observed. this delay was more or less pronounced depending on the percentage of cells expressing both molecules. there was no delay in the appearance of tumors derived from the pool containing  <dig> % of cells expressing only cd <dig> and  <dig> % of cells expressing cd <dig> and cd <dig>  a delay was observed in the appearance of tumors derived from the pool containing  <dig> % of cells expressing only cd <dig> and  <dig> % of cells expressing cd <dig> and cd <dig> .

discussion
in this study, we have constructed and tested different tricistronic retroviral vectors containing ires elements from different origins. as ireses are remarkably efficient when used in bicistronic vectors, it was particularly interesting from a biotechnological point of view  to design polycistronic vectors that could allow the expression of several proteins from the same mrna. several authors have reported the construction of different vectors using the iresemcv or the iresfmdv2a to trigger the high level expression of an exogenous gene <cit> . prats and coll. have described several other ireses including the iress from the c-myc proto-oncogene, the ires from fgf- <dig> and the ires from htlv- <dig>  <cit> . the first aim of our work was to determine whether one of these ireses could induce a higher level of exogenous protein expression than the ires from emcv in different cell lines. the second aim was to design polycistronic vectors carrying different ireses to avoid the risk of recombination between ireses. the third aim was to obtain genetically modified melanoma cells through transduction with tricistronic retroviral vectors. these tumor cells would therefore be genetically modified to express two co-stimulatory molecules, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  which are known to induce an anti-tumor response in syngeneic mice.

as we have generated retroviral vectors derived from the well known mfg vector , we already had one additional ires upstream from the first atg codon . this ires has been described by vagner and coll  <cit> . the first ires  and the third ires  were conserved in all the vectors. the second ires responsible for inducing the translation of the selectable marker, was the ires from either emcv, fgf- <dig>  c-myc or htlv- <dig> 

the choice of ires that was used to express the cdna encoding the g <dig> or zeocin-resistance genes was unimportant as we obtained resistant cells in all the cell lines tested: murine tumor cells , murine fibroblasts , packaging cell line , human melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma cells . however, when the ires from the c-myc proto-oncogene was used, we never obtained long-lasting zeocin or g <dig> resistant murine or human cells, whether these were tumor cells or fibroblasts. so far, most of the cellular mrnas that contain ireses and code for proteins involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, require stringent regulation like for example the c-myc mrnas  <cit> . these genes need to be expressed at very specific stages of the cell cycle and/or in response to different stimuli  <cit> . this has also been shown for fgf- <dig>  indeed the cug-initiated isoforms of fgf- <dig> are translationally activated in response to stress  <cit> . such observations suggest that when the iresc-myc is used, translation is strongly downregulated  <cit> .

we obtained long-lasting viable resistant cells when we used the ireses from emcv, fgf- <dig> or htlv- <dig>  the number of clones obtained after transduction or transfection was roughly the same depending on the experiments and the cell lines tested. this indicated that only a few  recombination events occurred when we used the same ires  twice in the same retroviral vector.

the first and third ireses are responsible for inducing the translation of the two co-stimulatory molecules. these ireses competed to induce the expression of the two exogenous cdnas. indeed within the same population of selected cells, whatever the retroviral vector used, we were able to obtain cells that only expressed the first exon, or only the third exon or both exons. the percentage of cells that expressed both co-stimulatory molecules varied with the cell passage and from one selected clone to another. this is true regardless of the cell line tested: murine tumor cells , murine fibroblasts , murine packaging cell line , human melanoma cells and human lung adenocarcinoma cells . there is a difference in the ires-dependent mechanism that occurs in cellular and viral internal initiation. currently, two cellular trans-acting factors, the la antigen and ptb have been found to bind to picornavirus ires elements and to be essential for their internal initiation of translation  <cit> . however, these proteins do not specifically bind to eukaryotic cellular mrnas with the same efficiency. ires function must require either different amounts of translation initiation factors or, more likely, additional proteins similar to those required for the cap-dependent initiation of protein synthesis  <cit> . borman and coll. have recently shown that the recognition of different ires elements varies within different tissue culture cell lines  <cit> . the activity of a particular ires within a cell may be dependent on the relative level of stimulatory and inhibitory molecules  <cit> . it is possible that different trans-acting factors that are dependent on a specific ires may be required. it could be that the mulv ires  binds those trans-acting factors with a higher affinity than the ires from emcv . anthony and merrick suggested that translation factors, that have a higher affinity for the cap structure than for the ires element, could be sequestered at the m7gpppn cap structure and would therefore be unavailable for the internal initiation of translation at saturating concentrations of capped bicistronic rna  <cit> . this would lead to an increased translation of the first cistron and a decreased translation of the second and third cistrons that are thought to be dependent on internal initiation of translation. in our case, we have an ires  on the 5' end of the mrna. this ires induces the translation of the first co-stimulatory molecule. however, while the ires from emcv or htlv- <dig> could interact with other ireses present within the retroviral construct , we found that the ires from fgf- <dig> induced the expression of exogenous cdna in human melanoma cells without any positive or negative regulation from the other ireses.

we have previously shown that two co-stimulatory molecules , expressed on the surface of tumor cells could induce an anti-tumor immune response when the cells were injected into a syngeneic animal  <cit> . in tumor cells that were genetically modified by the tricistronic retroviral vector, we attempted to induce an in vivo anti-tumor response in murine models. we first showed that b <dig> f <dig> cells that were genetically modified by the tricistronic vectors, could induce in vitro proliferation of spleen cells. these b <dig> f <dig> cells were then injected into syngeneic animals and tumor growth was monitored. we observed that in this murine model  or in the balb/c murine model , co-expression of the two co-stimulatory molecules by at least  <dig> % of cells was necessary to induce an anti-tumor response. cd <dig> expression, alone or in association with a low level of cd <dig> expression, was not sufficient to induce anti-tumor immunity. these findings show that at least  <dig> % of the genetically modified cells must express the cd <dig> and cd <dig> co-stimulatory molecules before starting an immunotherapy protocol. establishing cultures of human melanoma cells derived from biopsies was very difficult, we obtained a low yield of  <dig> %. we could infect human melanoma cells with the tricistronic retroviral vector with an efficiency of  <dig> %. however, within the  <dig> % of cells that were genetically modified we could only obtain a high percentage of cells expressing both co-stimulatory molecules when we used the tricistronic recombinant amphotropic viruses obtained with the ires fgf- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the ability of retroviral vectors carrying ireses to deliver genes, in vitro and in vivo, to a variety of dividing cell types has been applied to research and gene therapy for the past  <dig> years. our work shows that it is difficult to chose which ires must be inserted into a polycistronic gene therapy vector, when the aim is to ensure a high level of translation of the exogenous gene. this level of expression will depend on the type of cell that is transduced but also on the presence of other genetic elements within the vector.
