BACKGROUND
tcp proteins, named after the three first characterized family members teosinte branched   <dig> from maize, cycloidea  from antirrhinum majus, and proliferating cell factors  from rice are plant-specific transcription factors characterized by the tcp domain, a motif encompassing a non-canonical basic-helix-loop-helix  structure  <cit> . while initially these transcription factors were implicated in the regulation of growth and development, it has become apparent that they are involved in many processes including senescence, circadian rhythm and hormone signaling . based on the homology of the tcp domains, tcp proteins can be divided into two major classes, class i and class ii. the first is represented by the rice pcf proteins and many of its members have no known function so far. the arabidopsis gene attcp <dig> has been shown to regulate embryonic growth potential in arabidopsis seeds  <cit>  and together with attcp <dig>  it regulates internode length  <cit> . attcp <dig> appears to function in diverse developmental processes, such as growth processes  <cit> , jasmonic acid  biosynthesis and leaf senescence  <cit> . attcp <dig> is predominantly expressed in developing microspores, and its down-regulation in transgenic plants resulted in 50% abnormal pollen  <cit> .

class ii, represented by cyc and tb <dig>  contains most genes with known functions. the cyc gene, together with the related dichotoma  in antirrhinum is required for dorsoventral asymmetry of the flower  <cit> . the arabidopsis cyc/dich homolog attcp <dig> regulates the expression of the brassinosteroid synthetic gene dwarf <dig> and is thus also linked to growth  <cit> . the tb <dig> gene affects the fate of maize axillary meristems. it prevents the outgrowth of buds at the lower nodes and it promotes the formation of female inflorescences at the higher nodes  <cit> . in arabidopsis, two homologs of tb <dig>  branched <dig>  and branched <dig>  are expressed in axillary buds, and mutants with reduced activity of either gene show increased branching  <cit> . the tomato orthologs slbrc1a and slbrc1b have similar functions in tomato axillary bud initiation and outgrowth  <cit> .

other examples of tcp genes affecting plant architecture are cincinatta in antirrhinum <cit>  and its homolog lanceolate  in tomato  <cit> . the dominant lanceolate mutation in tomato produces small simple leaves instead of the normally large and compound ones. the corresponding tcp gene allele la contains point mutations in a mir319-binding site, leading to reduced sensitivity to mirna regulation. one other full-length mrna and two mrna fragments with putative mir319-binding sites, designated sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> after their closest homologs in arabidopsis, respectively, were also identified  <cit> . the arabidopsis homologs, as well as attcp <dig> and attcp <dig>  have been earlier identified as targets of mirna <dig> through activation-tagging mutants of the mirna319-encoding jaw locus  <cit>  and are therefore, called jaw clade tcp genes. in the activation-tagged jawd mutant, which exhibits a reduced expression of the jaw clade tcp genes, the differential regulation of cell division during leaf development is disturbed, causing negative leaf curvature and crinkly leaves  <cit> . mirna319-targetting attcp <dig> is required for petal growth and development  <cit> . the same clade of mirna319-regulated genes in arabidopsis has been shown to control ja synthesis and leaf senescence  <cit> . studies in arabidopsis suggest that cca <dig> hiking expedition   is involved in circadian clock regulation by repressing the circadian clock associated  <dig>  gene  <cit> .

a group of homologous tcps of arabidopsis functions redundantly in the control of shoot lateral organ morphology through the negative regulation of boundary-specific genes such as cup-shaped cotelydon  <dig> <cit> . the only known example of a tcp gene affecting fruit development is the phenotype of a dominant-negative variant of attcp <dig>  where the siliques are shorter and their surface wrinkled  <cit> .

as in other transcription factors, the basic region of the tcp domain is likely to be involved in dna binding, but deletion studies have shown that both n- as well as c-terminal regions of the conserved bhlh-domain are required for target site recognition by the rice pcf <dig>  <cit> . modeling of arabidopsis tcp <dig> dimers bound to target dna suggest that the first part of the basic region of the tcp domain forms a small α-helix involved in dna base interactions and the c-terminal part of this region may form an α-helix contiguous with helix  <dig>  homology modeling based on the animal bhlh protein myod suggests that the helix-loop-helix region is responsible for dimerization  <cit> . it was shown that tcp proteins tend to form homodimers or heterodimers with other tcp proteins of the same class  <cit> .

the consensus binding site sequences for the two classes are distinct, but overlapping  and the core  shared by these sequences has a strict role in the binding of both classes  <cit> . tcp-binding elements are found in the promoters of various cell cycle related genes and of genes encoding ribosomal proteins  <cit> . attcp <dig> has been found to physically bind to synthetic versions of these elements, as well as to cis-elements in the promoter of the mitotic cyclin cycb1; <dig> gene. it was proposed that organ growth rates and possibly shape are regulated by the balance between positively and negatively acting tcp proteins competing for binding to the same promoters  <cit> . later, it was found that class i tcp proteins act antagonistically to the class ii jaw-tcps via the ja signaling pathway, as tcp <dig> inhibits lox <dig>  and tcp <dig> induces lox <dig> expression  <cit> .

in this manuscript we describe the identification and characterization of  <dig> different tcp-encoding genes from tomato . using quantitative rt-pcr we have determined their expression in different tissues and during fruit development, revealing differential expression patterns of members during fruit development and ripening. the latter was shown to be dependent on several major ripening regulatory transcription factors like lemads-rin   <cit> , a mads box protein, colorless non-ripening , a squamosa promoter binding protein   <cit> , and apetala2a , an apetala2/ethylene response factor   <cit> . these ripening-associated transcription factors regulate ripening through the biosynthesis of ethylene and/or its signalling.

this is the first study revealing the correlation of tcp transcription factors in fleshy fruit development and ripening. moreover, we further investigated their regulation by identification of transcription factors interacting with promoter sequences of these genes in a yeast one-hybrid assay. furthermore, in a yeast 2-hybrid assay we have determined the capacity of the tomato tcp proteins to form homo- and heterodimeric interactions. comparison of the characteristics of the tomato family members with those from other plant species may reveal common and diverged features and may give clues about the function of the tomato tcp genes.

RESULTS
identification and cloning of tomato tcp genes
by mining the tomato unigene and bac sequence databases from the sol genomics network with homology searches and subsequent sequence extension by race, we initially identified and cloned  <dig> different tomato genes encoding putative tcp transcription factors . many of the sequences we have identified had only  <dig> or few representative est in the databases. four genes had no representative est and were identified directly from the genomic sequence available at the time. publication of the tomato genome sequence allowed the identification of another  <dig> sltcp genes . of the  <dig> identified unique genes,  <dig> full-length mrna sequences, for lanceolate and sltcp <dig> <cit> , and three partial sequences, previously named sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig>  and sltcp <dig> <cit> , here renamed sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig>  and sltcp <dig>  respectively, were already present in genbank. sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> <cit>  were subsequently also named brc1b and brc1a, respectively  <cit> .

genomic organization and phylogenetic analysis
the chromosome location of the  <dig> genes is depicted in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we found in the published heinz  <dig> genome  four additional full length copies of sltcp <dig> and one partial copy each of sltcp <dig>  and sltcp <dig> , respectively, in different genomic locations . the additional copies of sltcp <dig> have in their close vicinity open reading frames with homology to transposon sequences, suggesting that they are the result of mobilization by transposable element activity. since our experimentally determined mrna sequences as well as publicly available est sequences map uniquely to the respective genes and not to these additional copies, we conclude that these copies are not expressed under conditions used by ourselves or by others. this is further supported by the observation of genomic synteny in the plant genome duplication database   <cit> , where sltcp <dig> and its genomic environment is contained in a block showing extensive synteny with  <dig> different genomic sequence blocks in  <dig> plant species, with the four copies  showing no synteny with other genomes at all . similarly, there is an almost perfect copy  of sltcp <dig>  which is also associated with transposon-like sequences.

phylogenetic analysis of the extended tcp domains of the predicted proteins following alignment together with the  <dig> known arabidopsis tcp proteins is shown in figure  <dig>  the phylogenetic comparison with the arabidopsis tcp proteins showed that conservation between proteins of the two species is usually low. higher similarity of proteins within the same species indicates that gene duplications have occurred after the split between the two lineages. it also suggests that the higher number of genes in tomato, compared to arabidopsis, is the result of more gene duplication events in tomato or of higher frequency of retaining copies after duplication. only the arabidopsis attcp <dig> stands out as not having a close homolog in tomato.

the phylogenetic analysis showed that sequence conservation outside the approximately  <dig> amino acid tcp domain was low and sequence length on both sides of the tcp domain varied greatly, resulting in proteins ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> amino acids. the smallest predicted protein, sltcp <dig>  is probably truncated by a frame shift mutation since sequence homology with arabidopsis tcp <dig> extends well beyond the stop codon. the low overall conservation resulted in relatively low bootstrap values, indicating poor reliability of some of the branches. analysis of the phylogenetic tree as well as of the alignment of the tcp domains  showed that tomato tcp proteins can be divided into two subfamilies, as for all species so far. the cyc/tb <dig> or class ii subfamily has, as reported earlier, an extended basic region, while class i subfamily members have extended homology c-terminal from the tcp domain, and both subfamilies have internally conserved, but distinct loop region sequences  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree also supported the arabidopsis and rice earlier described division of class ii proteins in two further subfamilies  <cit> . according to this division, class iia or cyc/tb <dig> contains the tomato genes brc1b , sltcp <dig>  brc1a , sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig>  and sltcp <dig>  from figure 2a it is evident that sltcp <dig> lacks the conserved n-terminal part of the basic region, which suggests that this protein may not be able to bind dna.

class iib or cin-tcps, so named after their homology with antirrhinum cincinatta, is a group of  <dig> tcp proteins in arabidopsis involved in leaf growth regulation   <cit> . tomato has  <dig> proteins in this homology group, among which the earlier identified lanceolate, sltcp <dig> to sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . the tree topology, particularly for class ii, was further supported by analysis of synteny. inspection of synteny in the plant genome duplication database  found synteny between genomic regions for all tomato and arabidopsis genes in the cyc/tb1-subclass, as well as for the genes from the subclade containing lanceolate and the subclade containing tomato tcp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  this suggests that members from these subclades originated from ancient whole genome or segmental duplications in a common ancestor of arabidopsis and tomato. tomato tcp <dig> and - <dig> do not show any synteny in the pgdd, whereas their closest arabidopsis homologs do have extensive synteny with various species. since these genes are arranged as a tandem inverted repeat on chromosome  <dig>  they may be the result of a lineage-specific rearrangement that is absent in arabidopsis.

as reported earlier for arabidopsis tcp <dig>  tcp <dig>  tcp <dig>  tcp <dig>  and tcp <dig>  a subset of the closest tomato homologs of these arabidopsis tcp proteins, brc1b , sltcp <dig>  brc1a , sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig>  and sltcp <dig> contain the so-called r-domain c-terminal of the tcp domain  <cit> . r domain-like sequences are also present in sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig>  but there they are less conserved .

in arabidopsis,  <dig> of the class iib members are post-transcriptionally regulated by mirna <dig>   <cit> . the closest tomato homologs of these arabidopsis genes are the three new genes, sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig>  and sltcp <dig>  and the earlier identified sltcp <dig>  lanceolate , sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig>  respectively  <cit> ), all having a putative binding site for mir319a. this suggests that regulation of leaf development by a redundant set of mirna-regulated homologous tcp genes occurs in tomato. sltcp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> have considerable expression, although not exclusively, in tomato leaves. figure 2c shows the alignment of the target sites of these genes with the mir319a sequence. in a previously published degradome study, the transcripts of all putative mir <dig> targets identified here, with exception of sltcp <dig>  were shown to be actually cleaved in tomato fruits  <cit> .

expression analysis of the tomato tcp genes
in order to predict possible functions as well as to identify probable functional redundancy through overlapping expression patterns for the tomato tcp genes, we determined expression levels of all  <dig> genes by quantitative rt-pcr. we used mrna isolated from: tomato seedlings, leaves, roots, flowers at anthesis, flowers at 2 days post anthesis , immature green fruit at two sizes , mature green fruit, breaker stage fruit, turning stage fruit, and red ripe fruit. all expression levels  as related to the expression of the β-actin gene are shown in numerical order in figure  <dig>  from figure  <dig> it is apparent that the expression levels in different organs vary widely between the tomato tcp genes, as well as between different organs for individual tcp genes. the representatives of class ii tcps have high expression mostly in flowers at anthesis,  <dig> dpa and leaves. in addition to the already mentioned organs, sltcp <dig> shows relatively high expression in seedlings and lower in developing fruits.

we have identified  <dig> proteins as member of the class i group. many class i genes seem more widely and less specifically expressed, such as in leaves, flowers, and early stages of developing fruits . sltcp <dig> and tcp <dig> appear to lack organ specificity, while sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> are the only genes with high expression during ripening, with sltcp <dig> particularly rising at and beyond the mature green stage. most class ii genes are not expressed in fruits beyond the flower  <dig> dpa stage. sltcp <dig> is relatively highly expressed up to the 5 mm fruit stage, after which the expression drops and comes back during ripening, with highest expression in the turning stage. the expression in tomato fruit is of particular interest since this is the first example of extensive characterization of tcp gene expression in a fleshy fruit species. sltcp <dig> is regulated during ripening; however its expression is low in all tissues. sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> are particularly interesting because of their expression during fruit ripening. the expression pattern of sltcp <dig> is strikingly complementary to that of its closest homolog sltcp <dig>  possibly pointing to an example of neofunctionalisation after gene duplication through divergence of expression patterns. opposite to the upward regulation of sltcp <dig> during ripening, sltcp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> show high expression up to the 5 mm fruit stage, followed by a sharp drop and sltcp <dig> being expressed again during ripening. the regulation of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> during the onset of ripening may have functional significance that may not apply in non-fleshy arabidopsis siliques.

interactions between tomato tcp proteins
tcp proteins tend to form homodimers or heterodimers with other tcp proteins, and dimerization may be required for their dna-binding activity and hence for their biological activity. we have determined dimer formation between  <dig> cloned tomato sltcp proteins in a yeast 2-hybrid assay. open reading frames were cloned as translational fusions with the yeast gal <dig> transcription factor binding-  or activation-  domain and all combinations were tested in a matrix set-up. results are represented schematically in figure  <dig>  where the proteins are arranged according to their phylogenetic relatedness, and interaction scoring tables can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig>  of the  <dig> bd-fusion proteins tested,  <dig> had autoactivation activity in yeast  on both selection media, while four showed autoactivation only on -lth medium. with the exception of sltcp <dig>  these were found to be all class ii tcp transcription factors, an overrepresentation that was also observed for arabidopsis tcp transcription factors  <cit> . thus, interactions could not be scored for the corresponding bd clones  or could be scored only on –lta medium. altogether we observed  <dig> interactions, with a few exceptions on both selective media. of these, in  <dig>  the partners interacted in both bd/ad-orientations, including  <dig> homodimer formations. the latter number may be an underestimation because homodimer formation could not be tested in the autoactivating family members. the summary of the interaction results shows that tomato tcp proteins form both homo- and heterodimers, in the latter case preferentially with proteins of the same class  as was previously noted for arabidopsis  <cit> , although a few  inter-class interactions were detected. sltcp <dig>  which shows autoactivating activity on one medium, has only sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> overlapping and five different interactions compared to its nearest homolog sltcp <dig>  which is not autoactivating. together with the different expression patterns, this points to functional divergence after the gene duplication. again similar to the arabidopsis tcp proteins, more interactions were found for class i proteins than were found for class ii proteins , although also here the number of interactions for class ii proteins may be underestimated because of the autoactivating members. the interactions obtained by a comprehensive yeast two-hybrid screen of the tomato tcp transcription factors, has not yet been reported to such extent for tcp members from other species than arabidopsis. these yeast 2-hybrid interactions of the tomato tcp genes confirmed earlier observations for rice  <cit> , showing that tcp proteins form homodimers, and heterodimers particularly with proteins within the same class. the combination of expression analysis and dimerization properties may in the future help to identify tcp protein pairs that function together and to explain observed functional redundancies in case of overlapping interaction maps.

the expression of the tomato tcp <dig>  tcp <dig> and tcp <dig> genes is affected by mutations in major ripening regulatory genes
we demonstrated that sltcp <dig>  and - <dig> show differential expression during fruit ripening, with sltcp <dig> highly expressed in the ripening stages and sltcp <dig> being increasingly expressed from early stages gradually to red ripe fruits. sltcp <dig> expression is high in flowers at anthesis,  <dig> dpa and 5 mm fruit, which are stages associated with a high mitotic index rate  <cit>  and then regulated again during ripening, peaking in the breaker stage. the expression patterns of these tcps suggested that they might be positively or negatively regulated by ripening, and thus directly or indirectly by some of the known major regulators of this process. we determined the expression of these tcp genes by qrt-pcr analysis performed in fruits of the br +  <dig>  stage of the tomato ripening-defective mutants cnr  <cit> , rin  <cit> , nor <cit>  and in transgenic slap2a knock-down plants  <cit> . as expected, the transcript levels of sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> are regulated in several of the ripening mutants . sltcp <dig>  associated with ripening, is significantly and positively regulated by slap2a, cnr and rin , while the expression of sltcp <dig>  associated with early fruit development, is not statistically significantly regulated by slap2a and cnr . rin positively and significantly regulates sltcp <dig> . sltcp <dig>  which has expression in all stages of fruit development, with a high increase during ripening, is significantly down regulated in slap2a rnai, cnr and rin . the three tcps are not significantly regulated in the nor mutant . the positive regulation of sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> by cnr, slap2a and rin, indicates that they might be positively associated with ripening. additionally, rin positively regulates sltcp <dig>  associating it also with the ripening process.

ripening-related tomato transcription factor proteins bind sltcp <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> promoter elements
the altered expression of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in the ripening mutants and slap2a transgenic knockdown plants indicates that they are regulated by key ripening regulatory genes, but does not show if this regulation is direct. in order to find out if these transcription factors could be directly interacting with the promoters of sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig>  we used yeast-one-hybrid assays to identify transcription factors binding to the promoter fragments of the ripening related sltcp genes. the promoter elements used were upstream of the transcription start sites and were as follows: 568-bp promoter fragment for sltcp <dig>  500-bp fragment of sltcp <dig> and 473-bp fragment of sltcp <dig>  in this assay we detected interaction between the ripening regulator rin and the promoters of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> as well as between cnr and the promoter of tcp <dig> . this data strongly suggests that the regulation of these tcps by rin and cnr is direct.

representing the binding of: slap2a, rin and cnr, as well as the tomato tcp proteins to the promoter elements of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  ”-” represents no binding, “+” represents binding.

in the cases where regulation of sltcp expression by ripening regulatory transcription factors was detected, but no binding to the target promoter was observed, several other scenarios are possible. the length of the promoter fragments used in the assay is limited and may not have comprised all putative transcription factor binding sites. alternatively, regulation of expression may be indirect via regulation of expression of other transcription factors that do bind the target promoter.

arabidopsis transcription factors binding the promoter fragments of sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp18
to identify more potential regulators of tomato sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig>  we performed a yeast one-hybrid assay with transcription factors fused to the gal <dig> activation domain. since there is no large collection of cloned tomato transcription factors, instead we opted for initially testing the available regia collection of arabidopsis transcription factors, consisting of  <dig> cloned transcription factor gene open reading frames  <cit> . all transcription factors interacting with one or more of the promoter fragments are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  these results demonstrate that the sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> promoter fragments interact with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different arabidopsis transcription factors, respectively. nine arabidopsis transcription factors bind the promoters of all three sltcp genes . one of those is the ethylene-responsive gene atdear <dig> , also named cej <dig> . in arabidopsis, dear <dig> expression is induced by pathogen infection  <cit> .

the common interactions for sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> promoter fragments, in addition to the atdear1/cej <dig> protein, are nine. sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> share additional  <dig> common interactions. sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> have  <dig> common interactions, among which one encodes a member of the dreb subfamily a- <dig> of erf/ap <dig> transcription factor family, another ethylene responsive gene. the fact that both sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> have more common interactions compared to sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> or sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig>  may be due to their expression overlap during ripening.

this experiment demonstrates that there are a lot of arabidopsis transcription factors binding the promoter elements of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  whether the same trend can be observed with tomato transcription transcription factors may be further investigated. in the absence of a comprehensive library of cloned tomatos tfs, we speculate that the same would be observed for tomato tfs. recent studies in arabidopsis show that many binding sites can be occupied by transcription factors, in a dynamic manner without them necessarily being active regulators of the bound promoter  <cit> . we performed gene onthology  term enrichment analysis for transcription factors binding to each of the three sltcp promoters versus the tested  <dig> arabidopsis transcription factors from the regia collection. the results did not show significant enrichment per go category, suggesting that these tcps may be involved in or regulated by many different processes.

some of the arabidopsis proteins binding sltcp <dig> promoter fragment are transcription factors known to be part of the ethylene signal transduction pathway. these include an erf/ap <dig> transcription factor gene encoding for related to ap <dig>  <dig> , other genes from the erf  family, and ethylene-insensitive3-like  <dig> . several ap2/erf proteins also bind sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> independently . the regulation of sltcp genes by ethylene responsive genes may indicate an indirect mechanism of ethylene-dependant expression of these sltcps during ripening.

tomato transcription factors binding to the sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> promoter elements
using the observed interactions with arabidopsis transcription factors as a lead to candidate regulators from tomato, we selected some of the strongest interacting proteins and identified their closest tomato homologs by blast homology searches. these were subsequently cloned and used in a yeast one-hybrid assay as described above. the tomato genes used are listed in table  <dig> next to their arabidopsis homologs, together with their interactions with the tomato tcp promoters.

yeast one-hybrid results, representing the binding of the selected arabidopsis transcription factor proteins and the corresponding tomato putative orthologs to the tomato tcp <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> promoter elements independently. ”-” represents no binding, “+” represents binding.

the arabidopsis dear <dig>  also named cej <dig> binds the promoter fragments of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and its identified tomato homolog solyc04g <dig>  interacts with the sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> promoters . let <dig> is the tomato homolog of the arabidopsis knat <dig> and knat <dig>  which bind to the sltcp <dig> and - <dig> and sltcp <dig> and - <dig> promoter fragments, respectively. the tomato homolog let <dig> however binds only to the sltcp <dig> promoter . let <dig> <cit>  is a class ii knox gene , expressed in all tissues, but has high expression in green fruits and leaves  <cit> .

arabidopsis svp  binds the sltcp <dig> promoter fragment. the tomato homolog of svp, jointless  binds to both sltcp <dig> and sltcp <dig> promoter fragments . in arabidopsis, svp controls flowering time and maintains the meristematic activity during the early floral meristem stages  <cit> , while in tomato j regulates pedicel abscission zone formation and maintenance of the inflorescence meristem  <cit> .

tcp transcription factors bind the promoters of sltcp <dig>  sltcp <dig> and sltcp18
the protein-dna interaction assay performed with the arabidopsis tf collection and the tomato promoter fragments show that there are arabidopsis tcps binding the promoter fragments of tomato tcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . attcp <dig> and - <dig> bind the sltcp <dig> promoter, while attcp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> bind the sltcp <dig> promoter. the sltcp <dig> promoter did not show any binding activity with arabidopsis tcp transcription factors.

in the yeast one-hybrid assay we also screened for promoter-binding activity of the tomato tcp proteins. this experiment revealed that the binding of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> by the arabidopsis tcp transcription factors are seen also with most of their tomato sltcp homologs. sltcp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  which are class ii tcp tfs, bind the class i sltcp <dig> promoter . expression of these proteins peaks in flowers and early fruit development, in contrast to sltcp <dig>  which peaks from mature green fruit onwards and in roots. these complementary expression patterns suggest that binding of the class ii tcps inhibits sltcp <dig> expression. interestingly, sltcp <dig>  a class i tcp regulated in all tissues and closest homolog of sltcp <dig>  also binds to the sltcp <dig> promoter .

sltcps binding the sltcp <dig> promoter are sltcp <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  which are class ii tcps, strongly expressed in flowers at anthesis and  <dig> dpa, and in leaves . class i sltcps also bind the sltcp <dig> promoter. among them is sltcp <dig>  whose expression increases during ripening . sltcp <dig> shows a different trend of regulation, being regulated by more representatives of its own class. generally, the proteins from class i and ii tcps binding sltcp <dig> are expressed in flowers, early fruit development and leaves, which fits well with the expression of sltcp <dig>  therefore, we can hypothesize that this binding leads to activating the expression of sltcp <dig>  the regulation of sltcp <dig> by sltcp <dig> may be linked to ripening, because both genes have higher expression during breaker and turning fruit stages.

sltcp <dig> promoter is bound only by class i sltcps, which expression patterns are complementary to that of sltcp <dig> . this suggests that these class i sltcps may regulate sltcp <dig> in a negative way.

the protein-dna interaction between tcp transcription factors and sltcp <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> promoter elements suggest that tcps regulate the expression of other members of their own family. this regulatory network is visualized in figure  <dig>  it also suggests that sltcps from class ii regulate sltcps from class i, and sltcps from class i regulate sltcps from the same class. this cross-regulation among sltcp genes suggests that class ii sltcps may act as repressors of class i, but on the other hand, class i may activate genes from their own class, as this may be the case with sltcp <dig>  thus, the tomato tcp genes are likely part of an interrelated regulatory network, as has already been described for tcp genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . since these regulatory interactions were inferred from yeast one-hybrid assay results, which are prone to producing false positives, further in vivo and/or in planta experiments are needed to confirm these interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified the  <dig> members of the tomato tcp transcription factor gene family. tomato genes closely related to arabidopsis tcp genes, have similar expression patterns, which suggests conserved functions. additionally, the tomato tcp proteins form homodimers and heterodimers particularly with sltcps from the same class . this trend was reported before also in other species, like arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . sltcp <dig> is an exception, because it is a class i sltcp, dimerizing only with class ii sltcps . interestingly, the tomato tcp <dig>  tcp <dig> and tcp <dig> genes show differential expression patterns during fleshy fruit development and ripening. expression studies show that sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are positively regulated by the ripening regulators rin, cnr and slap2a, which are among the promoter binding proteins of these tcp genes . these data shows that the sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes are directly or indirectly controlled by these ripening regulators and might play a role in tomato fruit ripening. furthermore, we show that sltcp proteins can bind to the promoter sequences of other sltcp genes , suggesting that they could coordinately or competitively regulate their expression. our promoter and protein-protein interaction studies suggest that sltcp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  may be involved in a variety of other functions, in addition to fruit ripening. further research analyzing the phenotypes of knockout or knock down of sltcp <dig>  - <dig> or - <dig> will reveal more information about the function of these genes.
