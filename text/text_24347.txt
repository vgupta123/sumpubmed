BACKGROUND
the advent of high-throughput screening  has enabled successful unbiased drug-discovery and fostered the development of novel therapies  <cit> . arguably the most fruitful targets in hts platforms have been membrane proteins, which comprise 22 % of the proteins encoded by the genome and are targeted by 60 % of the approved drugs available today. incredibly, almost half of these drugs are directed at the rhodopsin-like class i g protein-coupled receptor  superfamily  <cit> . many of these receptors have underlying roles in a myriad of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and mental illness. therefore, membrane proteins represent a gold mine of targets that must be screened in order to fully exploit their rich therapeutic potential.

for instance, the expression of the leucine-rich g protein-coupled receptor- <dig>  was recently shown to identify stem cells of the intestine  <cit> . more recent evidence has demonstrated that adult tissue-specific stem cells of the stomach  <cit> , hair follicle  <cit> , and mammary gland  <cit> , can be identified solely through expression of lgr <dig>  the lgr5-expressing stem cell is a critical contributor to tissue maintenance, and may also be the cell of origin in gastrointestinal cancers  <cit> . lgr <dig> is a gpcr whose biochemical and cellular properties have evaded investigators since its discovery in  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, lgr <dig> is an exciting membrane protein target for which small molecule modulators are unfortunately lacking. previously, we have shown that lgr <dig> constitutively internalizes from the plasma membrane and retrograde traffics to the trans-golgi network  <cit> . inhibiting this internalization resulted in the formation of ‘cytonemes’, which are ultra-long actin-rich signaling filopodia capable of scaffolding cell signaling at a distance  <cit> . together, these data suggest that internalization and trafficking of lgr <dig> may be critical for fine-tuning its function. therefore, small molecule modulators of lgr <dig> trafficking may prove to be a powerful strategy for pharmacologically modulating stem cell activity.

high-throughput screening platforms for plasma membrane receptors have had success due to reliable cell-based systems for monitoring a diversity of downstream messengers  <cit> , such as camp, ca2+ mobilization, and rho gtpase activation, or translocation of adaptor molecules after activation such as β-arrestin  <cit> . however, in most cases, these assays are highly idiosyncratic and consequently require specialized protocol development. hts becomes especially challenging for those receptors that are biologically rich but have non-canonical signaling or remain uncharacterized, such as lgr <dig>  whereas receptor signaling is specialized, all classes of plasma membrane receptors are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, before their targeting to the cell surface. thus, plasma membrane trafficking is the single universal feature of membrane receptor protein regulation. reasons that hts trafficking screens are not more often utilized include a lack of reagent universality, expensive imaging equipment, and confounding background fluorescence that in many instances requires sophisticated de-convolution algorithms to identify subpopulations of membrane proteins.

our solution relies upon a new class of genetically encoded fluorogen activating proteins  that immuno-react with and induce the fluorescence of spectrally tunable and weakly fluorescent compounds   <cit> . the synthesis of a novel near-infrared fap :fluorogen  and its versatile use for in vivo imaging of tumors was recently described  <cit> . herein, we pair marscy <dig> with a low cost infrared  western-blotting scanner for simultaneous multi-plate analysis of receptor trafficking in a high-throughput system that we term irfap-hts. fluorogen fluorescence is increased up to  <dig> -fold when receptors genetically fused to the fap bind to the fluorogen. real-time monitoring of fap-tagged membrane protein trafficking occurs by simple addition of fluorogen without the need for reagent washes or highly-automated equipment  <cit> . we validated irfap-hts with gpcrs of well-known pharmacology and then confirmed its utility by screening and identifying small molecule modulators of lgr <dig> trafficking.

RESULTS
validating a sensor for visualizing cell surface expression of membrane proteins
quantifying receptor expression using affordable multi-purpose equipment available in most labs would be particularly advantageous to small academic laboratories. the excitation and emission of the marscy1/sci <dig> pair  occurs in a range suitable for use on many ir-western blotting scanners and is easily resolved from the visible spectrum, which is often filled by other reporters . the feasibility of the system was first tested by fusing an n-terminal hemagglutinin -marscy1-fap to lgr5-egfp . the membrane permeant near-ir fluorogen  stained marscy1-lgr5-egfp and verified the expected localization of lgr <dig> in intracellular vesicles . the membrane impermeant variant of sc <dig>  was next tested for its ability to confer cell-surface labeling of membrane proteins. sci <dig> enabled robust cell surface labeling of a marscy1-cd <dig> transmembrane fused protein, with undetectable intracellular staining .fig.  <dig> quantitative scanning of marscy1-tagged membrane proteins in a modular plate-based format. a top: cartoon depicting ha-fap fused to the n-terminus of the cd <dig> transmembrane domain. bottom: confocal imaging of fap-cd <dig> transfected cells stained with sci <dig>  b cartoon depicting ha-fap fused to the n-terminus of lgr <dig> and egfp fused to the c-terminus. c confocal imaging of fap-tagged lgr5-egfp transfected cells that were co-labeled with sci <dig>  and a primary ha-epitope antibody  at 4 °c to block receptor internalization and were chased in  for 30 minutes at 37 °c to allow constitutive internalization of lgr <dig>  . e infrared plate imaging of a 12-well plate  with fap-tagged lgr <dig> pulsed with sci <dig> and a primary ha-epitope antibody at 4 °c and then fixed. non-permeabilized cells were scanned on the plate at 700 nm  and 800 nm  . f integrated fluorescence intensity from . g marscy1-tagged hv2r was transiently transfected in hek cells on a 24-well plate and stimulated with vehicle  or the v2r ligand avp  for 1 hour. cells were sci <dig> stained, scanned, and quantified



the ability for sci <dig> to label cell surface marscy1-tagged receptors and permit real-time imaging of trafficking was evaluated and directly compared to standard ha-immunolabeling. cells expressing marscy1-lgr5-egfp were co-pulsed with ha-antibody and sci <dig> at 4 °c to label the cell-surface pool of the receptor . in the absence of chase, cells displayed low level lgr <dig> surface expression, as revealed by equivalent sci <dig> and ha-immunoreactivity. this corresponds with the previously described intracellular localization of lgr <dig> and is again revealed by native egfp fluorescence . previous findings demonstrate that lgr <dig> constitutive internalization can be blocked by overexpression of a dominant negative form of dynamin i   <cit> . k44a expression robustly increased cell surface staining by sci <dig> and ha-antibody staining . when cells were chased for 30 minutes at 37 °c, the cell surface fraction of lgr <dig> rapidly internalized into vesicles . k44a significantly blunted this internalization . importantly, marscy <dig> fusion did not perturb normal lgr <dig> trafficking  and could be used in combination with sci <dig> to monitor the subcellular distribution of lgr <dig> and its internalization by confocal microscopy .

previously, we quantified receptor internalization by ha-immunolabeling cells in a plate-format and scanning on an ir western blotting scanner  <cit> . therefore, we directly compared ha-immunolabeling and marscy1:sci <dig> staining on cells expressing marscy1-lgr5-egfp that were co-pulsed with sci <dig> and ha-antibody . the entire 12-well plate was scanned on a licor-odyssey® ir imaging system and quantified. marscy1-lgr5-egfp cells weakly expressed lgr <dig> on the plasma membrane, whereas those cells co-transfected with k44a demonstrated a robust increase in lgr <dig> cell surface expression. sci <dig> and ha- <dig> perform similarly in this assay and quantitatively confirm the confocal imaging data analysis . we also generated a marscy1-fused human vasopressin receptor- <dig>  and demonstrated that ir-scanning of marscy1:sci <dig> enabled quantification of prototypical agonist-induced gpcr internalization . at steady-state, the v2r exhibits very little internalization  <cit> . marscy <dig> staining and live confocal imaging confirmed this finding, verified that sci <dig> is membrane impermeant, and demonstrated that marscy1-tagging can be used to visualize trafficking in living cells in real-time . collectively, these data demonstrated that marscy1-tagged gpcrs and the membrane impermeant fluorogen sci <dig> can be used to quantifiably and reliably assess surface expression of gpcrs.

cell surface rescue of gpcrs
for marscy1:sci <dig> to be a valid screening platform, the assay must enable the robust quantification of receptor cell-surface expression in a high-throughput multi-well plate format. since small molecule modulators of lgr <dig> function have not been reported, we used a prototypical gpcr with better characterized trafficking and signaling modes to validate this system. most class  <dig> gpcrs possess a canonical ‘dry’ motif at the end of transmembrane-domain three which can stabilize the receptor in an inactive state and is also important in g protein-coupling   <cit> . mutations to this domain contribute to disease by resulting in constitutive activation and internalization of the receptor  <cit>  in addition to misfolded receptor that accumulates in the er  <cit> . therefore, we tested if the marscy1:sci <dig> system could be used to identify small molecules that rescue surface expression of a mutant gpcr with a known pharmacological profile. we generated an n-terminally marscy1-tagged wild-type human d <dig> dopamine receptor and a dry to aay mutant d2r . inclusion of an eyfp tag at the d2r c-terminus, revealed by confocal microscopy that wild-type human d <dig> dopamine receptor displayed normal cell surface expression relative to the internalized and intracellularly localized dry mutant. as expected, overnight treatment with the d2r antagonist spiperone significantly rescued surface expression of the dry mutant .fig.  <dig> monitoring cell surface rescue of a mutant intracellularly mis-localized membrane protein. a cartoon depicting ha-fap fused to the n-terminus of wild-type  d2r or dry-aay  d2r and eyfp on the c-terminus. b confocal imaging for eyfp-tagged wt-d2r or dry-d2r treated with vehicle  or the d2r antagonist spiperone . c infrared plate imaging for membrane impermeable sci <dig> bound to fap-tagged wt- or dry-d2r treated with dmso or spiperone  overnight. d quantification of triplicate experiments represented in panel  and normalized relative to wt-d2r surface expression . e small-scale dose-response screen of overnight treatment with small molecule antagonists using quantitative infrared plate imaging  m to 10- <dig>  m). f quantification of triplicate experiments of the representative image in  and normalized to spiperone . g infrared image of 10 μm spiperone dry-d2r surface expression rescue for z’-factor analysis. h  quantification of panel  and calculation of a z’-factor 



sci <dig> staining enabled robust visualization and quantification of plasma membrane surface rescue for the dry mutant receptor . this assay was then scaled up to a 96-well plate format for screening marscy <dig> dry mutant expressing cells against six characterized d2r antagonists. as expected, each antagonist was able to partially rescue dry mutant surface expression . z’-factor analysis provides a statistical measure of hts robustness and reliability with values > <dig>  considered to be an excellent screening platform  <cit> . a z’-factor of  <dig>  was calculated for spiperone-mediated dry surface expression in a 96-well plate format. these data demonstrated that the marscy1:sci <dig> system can report on the cell surface expression of gpcrs in a format amenable for hts.

hts for candidate small molecules that rescue lgr <dig> surface expression
the marscy1:sci <dig> system was then tested for its utility as a screening platform. lgr <dig> was chosen as a prime candidate due to its unique expression in stem cells, its well-documented constitutive internalization properties  <cit> , and its lack of reported small molecule modulators. before the lgr <dig> screen was initiated, the marscy1:sci <dig> system was first reformatted and tested in a 384-well system to increase throughput to  <dig>  wells/hour. z’-factors for the assay were calculated with either k44a overexpression or comparison to a cell line expressing an lg5/v2r fusion previously shown to have increased surface expression   <cit> . both comparisons demonstrated that the 384-well format provides an excellent screening platform that we have termed irfap-hts  . a total of  <dig>  compounds from five libraries of diverse chemical space were screened using irfap-hts. these libraries target kinases, gpcrs, and fda-approved clinically effective drugs and included john’s hopkins clinical compound library   <cit> , kinase gold library , prestwick library , sigmakinase , and actprob5k .fig.  <dig> screening for small molecule modulators of lgr <dig> surface expression. a infrared image of a stable u2os cell line expressing marscy1-lgr <dig> in a 384-well plate without  and with transient transfection  of dynamin i k44a . b quantification of  and z’-factor analysis. c infrared image of a stable u2os cell lines expressing marscy1-lgr <dig> compared to marscy1-lgr5/v2r-tail . d quantification of  and z’-factor analysis. e a total of  <dig> hits were cherry picked and incubated overnight at 37 °c on stable marscy1-lgr5-egfp cells. black bar, wild-type lgr5; hatched bar, +k44a control; pink bar, autofluorescent compounds . hits were measured against the ±  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> standard deviations from wild-type dmso mean . each compound is described according to plate id, library name , common drug name, and position on the secondary screening plate. f synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonists from  were purchased, in addition to dexamethasone, and screened in a dose-response assay. g and h spiperone and glucocorticoids, respectively, increase plasma membrane expression of d2r-dry and lgr5



we found  <dig> total hits that increased lgr <dig> surface expression, equating to a primary screen hit rate of  <dig>  %. we cherry-picked  <dig> of these hits and performed a secondary screen at 20 μm and  <dig>  μm and found that 25 % of these were reproducible at 20 μm . some hits were also discounted due to their fluorescent properties overlapping with the same spectrum as the ir detector. among the most promising hits, we were intrigued by the discovery of several glucocorticoids, some of which were hits across multiple libraries. each of the glucocorticoids potently and significantly increased lgr <dig> surface expression . other hits, while reproducible, were either beyond the scope of this study or have limited availability for further testing outside of in-house synthesis. the specificity of glucocorticoids was determined in a counter-screen against the d2r receptor using marscy1-dry expressing cells. the membrane permeant antagonist spiperone robustly rescues dry surface expression but has no effect on lgr <dig> . in contrast, glucocorticoids increase lgr <dig> surface expression while displaying no activity toward d2r dry . we tested dexamethasone for direct binding to lgr <dig>  dexamethasone did not bind to lgr <dig> with high-affinity . this implies that lgr <dig> surface expression might be indirectly regulated by glucocorticoid receptor signaling. these data demonstrate that the irfap-hts is a user-friendly, modular, and rapidly deployable screening platform.table  <dig> small molecules



discussion
historically, and as a result of reliance on state-of-the-art instrument technologies, screening platforms have required significant upfront capital investment in robotics, assay-specific detection systems, and workspace  <cit> . the irfap-hts platform described in this study instead enables real-time hts of membrane protein surface expression in an easy-to-use, versatile, and rapidly deployable format. the success of our platform lies in the ability to robustly and precisely screen for membrane protein trafficking with limited upfront investment. overall, this is a substantial departure from standard hts platforms. in summary, the irfap-hts provides a system where a single investigator in a small laboratory space can easily and affordably screen their chosen target against modestly sized compound libraries  in a single week.

a combination of several desirable features enabled realization of this technology. in contrast to other hts platforms, the fap-based screen only requires access to standard cell culture facilities, low-cost manual pipetting systems, and a highly-versatile ir western-blotting scanner commonly available to most basic science labs. in this study, we were able to utilize 12-, 24-, 96-, 384-, and single-well formats with little to no change in experimental workflow. this enables acquisition of close to  <dig>  data points in 1 hour, since six 384-well plates can be processed in parallel within approximately 30 minutes. the images generated in our assay encompass the plate in its entirety and enables immediate and visually qualitative hit-analysis. this mitigates the need for extensive data analysis, de-convolution, and software investment. our assay has essentially no, to at most, very low background due to the spectral characteristics of the near-ir region in cell-based systems. marscy1-tagged protein targets are easily generated using common molecular biological techniques and in the multitude of proteins tested have not significantly impacted normal trafficking. the specificity of marscy1-induced sci <dig> fluorescence is due to the very high-affinity antibody-based fluorescence enhancement. this chemistry enables scanning within minutes of sci <dig> addition without the need for washing unbound material. this obviates the need for additional liquid handling and plate-washers and thereby reduces cell loss that can accompany extensive handling. in addition, marscy1-sci <dig> enables co-screening with other fluorescent assay reporters, such as those far removed from the ir spectrum .

proof-of-principle for the irfap-hts was achieved by focusing on three different applications for membrane proteins. this included agonist-induced internalization of the v2r, antagonist drug rescue of the mutant d2r, and drug discovery for the small-molecule-orphan lgr <dig>  these data demonstrated that the irfap-assay can be utilized in agonist or antagonist mode without any modifications to the platform. for hts, we chose lgr <dig> as a prototype since we are interested in its unique trafficking properties, its role in stem cell biology and cancer, and its history as a difficult target to study. the proposed lgr <dig> ligands, rspondin  and norrin  <cit> , do not activate classical g protein or ß-arrestin dependent signaling pathways, making standard screening assays difficult. this is despite the conservation of key signaling determinants for typical gpcr signal transduction and a fully functional ß-arrestin translocation domain  <cit> . surprisingly, the irfap-hts system identified synthetic glucocorticoid receptor  agonists as potent modulators of lgr <dig> trafficking.

glucocorticoids exert many effects on tissue development and maturation. work from florence moog’s lab in the 1950s demonstrated that glucocorticoids drive proper maturation of the intestinal epithelium  <cit> . moog’s work enabled a series of investigations that further outlined roles for glucocorticoids in the maturation of the intestine. these studies confirmed moog’s original observations, identified the window of glucocorticoid responsiveness, and first suggested that cells within the crypt might be the primary target in the epithelium . interestingly, gr agonists act on intestinal epithelial cells to inhibit proliferation, promote morphological changes, and restructure the trans-golgi network   <cit> . therefore, in the context of our previous findings  <cit> , the gr-mediated restructuring of the tgn network may provide one mechanism whereby the tgn-localized lgr <dig> can more efficiently traffic to the plasma membrane. these data all point to an unexpected but important link between grs and lgr <dig>  the clinical and therapeutic implications of this finding will be the subject of future research.

repurposing drugs is a viable alternative to deep high-throughput screening of millions of combinatorial compounds with unknown pharmacological profiles  <cit> . in fact, directed screens against fda-approved compounds have been successful in defining new activity for many commonly used and clinically relevant compounds  <cit> . many of these hits can be used as a scaffold for chemical evolution to further refine their activity profile and efficacy  <cit> . therefore, using irfap-hts, small academic laboratories can now institute drug-repurposing programs targeted against their membrane protein of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
a major objective of the post-genomic era has been to identify molecular targets of disease and develop new modes of pharmacological intervention. therefore, we have developed a versatile irfap-hts for membrane protein trafficking so that any lab can easily screen approximately  <dig>  small molecules per week and have a high-probability of finding a significant hit. this study demonstrates the viability of this system by using nih-procured libraries and affordably priced commercial libraries. using irfap-hts, even the smallest of laboratories can make a minimal investment of $ <dig>  to obtain and screen approximately  <dig>  fda-approved compounds  <cit>  against any user-defined membrane protein. we expect that the irfap-hts will transform drug-discovery into an open-source pursuit within reach of all basic science and clinical research laboratories and, for the first time, provide a platform for the synergistic exploration of disease targets in the public domain.
