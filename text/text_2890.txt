BACKGROUND
the development of molecular methods of yeast characterization has demonstrated that some wine and brewing saccharomyces strains possess complex genomes composed by genetic elements from two or more species  <cit> . these strains are widely known as interspecific hybrids.

the best characterized industrial interspecific hybrid is the lager yeast s. pastorianus, originated from hybridization between s. cerevisiae and a s. bayanus-related yeast, which recently has been suggested to belong to the new species s. eubayanus <cit> . the hybridization between s. cerevisiae and the cryotolerant s. eubayanus have been suggested as the result of selective pressures derived from brewing at low temperatures  <cit> .

other kind of natural saccharomyces hybrids are those originated from hybridization between s. cerevisiae and s. kudriavzevii. these hybrids have mainly been isolated from wine and brewing environments  <cit> .

the role of the s. kudriavzevii genome in these hybrids is unclear, since the known strains of this species have been found in decaying leaves from japan and oak trees from portugal and spain  <cit> , but not in fermentative industrial environments yet. the physiological evaluation of some of these s. kudriavzevii isolates showed that this species is characterized by a higher cryotolerance than s. cerevisiae, but a lower ethanol tolerance  <cit> .

albeit differences between s. cerevisiae × s. eubayanus and s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids, the role of the s. eubayanus or s. kudriavzevii genomes in the hybrid seems to be similar, that is, the maintenance of good fermentative performance at low temperatures.

the characterization of a particular group of swiss wine hybrids by pcr-rflp, dna arrays, ploidy analysis and gene dose determination by quantitative real-time pcr, evidenced the existence of a single common hybridization event to explain the origin of these hybrids followed by extensive chromosomal rearrangements including chromosome losses and the generation of chimerical chromosomes  <cit> .

in this work, genome composition by array-cgh of a more diverse set of wine and brewing s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii natural hybrids from diverse origins was evaluated to decipher their origins and evolution. the examination of gene losses and gains as well as the maintenance of specific metabolic pathways from the s. cerevisiae or s. kudriavzevii parental genomes was also analyzed with the aim of elucidating the role of each parental genome in the fermentative performance of the hybrid strains.

methods
yeast strains and culture media
the natural yeast hybrids s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii used in this study have been isolated from wine and brewing fermentations in different locations . the haploid strain s. cerevisiae s288c was used as control for microarray dna hybridizations. yeast strains were grown at 28°c in gpy medium .

ploidy estimations by flow cytometry
ploidy estimates are very important to interpret acgh data from hybrids because hybridization signals are commonly normalized with respect to those of the reference haploid strain s288c.

the dna content of both hybrid and control strains was assessed by flow cytometry by two different procedures. the first ploidy estimates were obtained in a facscan cytometer  by using the propidium iodide dye method described in belloch et al.  <cit> . due to discrepancies with the acgh analysis, new estimates were later obtained in a beckman coulter fc  <dig>  by using the sytox green dye method described in haase and reed  <cit> . in both cases, ploidy levels were scored on the basis of the fluorescence intensity compared with the haploid  and diploid  reference s. cerevisiae strains. ploidy reported for each strain is the result of three independent measures. results were tested by one way anova and tukey’s hsd tests.

dna labeling and microarray competitive genome hybridization
total dna, extracted as described in querol et al.  <cit> , was resuspended in 50 μl of de-ionized water and digested with endonuclease hinf i , according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to fragments of an average length of  <dig>  to 8 kbp. each sample was purified using high pure pcr product purification kit  and 2 μg was labelled using bioprime array cgh genomic labelling system . unincorporated label was removed using minelute pcr purification kit . equal amounts of labelled dna from the corresponding hybrid strains and the control s288c strain were used as probes for microarray hybridization.

array competitive genomic hybridization  was performed using a double-spotted array containing  <dig>  orfs of s. cerevisiae plus control spots totaling  <dig>  k . new microarrays were pre-treated for one hour at 65°c with pre-hybridization solution . pre-hybridization solution was washed during 15 s in mili-q h2o, 2 s in 2-propanol, 2 s in milli-q h2o and dried by centrifugation at 1200 rpm, 10 min. microarrays were treated with hybridization solution  at 95°c for 1 min and at room temperature for 5 min before dna hybridization. hybridization was performed for 18 h in chamber at 65°c, thus allowing hybridization of the s. cerevisiae part of the hybrid genome. a negative control of microarray hybridization was done by using dna from s. kudriavzevii ifo  <dig> strain vs. s288c. after hybridization microarrays were washed at 65°c for 5 min in 2× ssc,  <dig> % sds, at room temperature in  <dig> × ssc−  <dig> % sds for 10 min and six times in  <dig> × ssc 1 min and dried by centrifugation at 1200 rpm, 10 min.

experiments were carried out in duplicates and cy5-dctp and cy3-dctp dye-swap assays were performed to reduce dye-specific bias. the acgh was performed for all hybrid strains except for w <dig>  w <dig>  spg16- <dig> and spg <dig> previously analyzed by belloch et al.  <cit> .

microarray scanning and data normalization
microarray scanning was done by using a genepix personal 4100a scanner . microarray images and raw data were produced with the genepix pro  <dig>  software  and background was subtracted by applying the local feature background median option. m-a plots  were represented to evaluate if ratio data were intensity-dependent. the normalization process and filtering were done using acuity  <dig>  . raw hybridization signals from hybrids were normalized with respect to those of the reference haploid strain s228c by using the ratio-based option, in which average hybridization ratios are adjusted to  <dig> .

normalized data were filtered by regression correlations 635/532 >  <dig> , signal intensity in both channels more than  <dig> units, and signal to noise  >  <dig> . features with artifacts or flagged as bad were removed from the analysis. replicates were averaged after filtering. it is worth to remark that strong normalization factors were applied to the negative control signal in each channel . raw data and normalized microarray data are available in arrayexpress  <cit> , under the ref. e-mexp- <dig> 

chromosome structure and recombination sites in the chimerical chromosomes
the log <dig> of normalized cy5/cy <dig> signal ratio obtained for each orf was represented with respect to its corresponding chromosomal location using the completely sequenced reference s. cerevisiae strain s288c. these plots, called caryoscopes, were generated using charm v. <dig>   <cit> . highly stringent hybridization conditions  were used to avoid the cross hybridization of s. kudriavzevii dna present in the hybrids. the caryoscope of the negative control experiment showed that most s. kudriavzevii genes did not hybridize under these conditions and in the case of cross hybridization  this was due to the very strong normalization factors applied in these control, which increased the red signal and reduced the green one by factors not applied in the case of the experiments performed with dna from hybrids . accordingly, differences in the log <dig> ratio values observed in the caryoscopes revealed variations in the relative copy number of s. cerevisiae genes present in the hybrid strains.

the identification of over- and underrepresented regions was confirmed due to the normalization procedure, the hybridization ratios derived from acgh analysis show the relative proportions of each gene with respect to the average number of copies in the hybrid, allowing the identification of over- and underrepresented regions in the hybrid genome by a one-way anova test to determine the different levels of hybridization observed in the acgh analysis. the approximate locations of the recombination points in the mosaic chromosomes were determined from the up and down jump locations in the orfs mapping by microarray analysis of the hybrid yeast genomes.

finally, by considering the collinearity of s. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae genomes  <cit> , the s. kudriavzevii gene content in the hybrid genomes can be deduced from the presence/absence of the chromosome regions coming from each parental species, obtained in a previous pcr-rflp analysis of these hybrids  <cit> .

gene ontology  analysis of s. kudriavzevii genes
genmapp v <dig>  software  <cit>  was used to perform gene ontology analysis of the s. kudriavzevii fraction in the hybrid genomes. four different go analyses were carried out using s. kudriavzevii genes present in all hybrid strains, including those previously characterized  <cit> , these analyses corresponded to: i) the complete set of wine and brewing hybrids, except strain amh, showing the lowest s. kudriavzevii gene content, ii) only wine hybrids, except amh, iii) only brewing hybrids and iv) only amh. in all cases, statistically significant go term enrichments were shown by computing a p-value using the hypergeometric distribution . go terms showing significant values  were sorted according to their corresponding go category.

maximum parsimony tree
a list of minimal number of chromosomal rearrangements, chromosomal losses and restriction site changes were used to reconstruct the maximum parsimony tree. data obtained from a previous study  <cit>  were again included in this analysis. a binary matrix was constructed to codify each particular event . parsimony trees were constructed by phylip  <dig>  package using the mix program  <cit> , taking chromosomal rearrangements and gain/losses as irreversible events  and the rflp changes as reversible events . the consensus tree was obtained with consense program using the majority rule.

RESULTS
hybrid genome structures
caryoscopes, representing log <dig> hybridization ratios for each gene mapped onto its corresponding chromosome position, of six hybrid strains from wine and  <dig> hybrids from brewing were obtained by array comparative genomic hybridization  . due to the normalization procedure, the hybridization ratios derived from acgh analysis show the relative proportions of each gene with respect to the average number of copies in the hybrid, allowing the identification of over- and underrepresented regions in the hybrid genome. however, acgh analysis in combination with ploidy estimates and with information on the presence/absence of the chromosome regions coming from each parental species, obtained in a previous pcr-rflp analysis of these hybrids  <cit> , allowed us to decipher the genome composition of hybrids.

this way, ploidy estimates for these hybrids were obtained by flow cytometry. the initial estimates with the propidium iodide method suggested that most hybrids were diploids or close to diploidy . however, these ploidy values were not congruent with the caryoscope and pcr-rflp data. the ratio-based normalization of hybridization signals adjusts the average signal ratios  to  <dig>  and hence the log <dig> values to  <dig>  in the analysis of hybrids, ploidy estimates were 2n- <dig> n, corresponding on average to a subgenome coming from each parental species, i.e. for each gene there are on average a copy coming from s. cerevisiae and another from s. kudriavzevii. due to the high astringent hybridization conditions used in the acgh analysis of hybrids, only the s. cerevisiae subgenome is hybridizing, as confirmed by the negative control performed with s. kudriavzevii dna. therefore, in the normalization of hybridization signals, these ratios correspond to the adjustment of average signals coming from  <dig> s. cerevisiae gene copy from the hybrid to  <dig> gene copy form the reference haploid s. cerevisiae strain. in the case of an increase of copy numbers in specific genes or chromosomal regions, log <dig> values should be higher than  <dig> , but in the case of loss of s. cerevisiae gene copies in the hybrid, a ratio of  <dig>  should be observed. however, 3– <dig> levels of log <dig> values, including negative but not infinite, are observed for some hybrids , which made difficult the interpretation of the acgh results and suggested that ploidy estimates with propidium iodide were wrong.

therefore, new ploidy estimates of hybrids were obtained by using sytox green as the dna-binding dye, because haase and reed  <cit>  demonstrated that improves linearity between dna content and fluorescence, and decreases peak drift associated with changes in dye concentration, growth conditions or cell size. in this new ploidy analysis, swiss wine hybrids analyzed in our previous study  <cit>  were also included.

the statistical analysis of the new estimates showed two significantly different groups of hybrids according to ploidy levels: most hybrids, including the swiss wine strains, appear as allotriploids and hybrids amh and pb <dig> as allotetraploid yeasts . the new ploidy estimates are in agreement with the different levels of hybridization observed in the acgh analyses and also with the previous pcr-rflp analysis of hybrids  <cit> . 

results are the mean value of three replicates. means with the same letters do not differ significantly by one way anova and tukey’s hsd tests .

final genome compositions were inferred for all hybrids as depicted in figure  <dig>  taking into consideration flow cytometry data, acgh and pcr-rflp data. for example, in the case of the partial allotetraploid hybrid amh, its caryoscope shows four different hybridization levels, which correspond to  <dig> copies of s. cerevisiae genes located in chromosomes  i and vi;  <dig> copies of s. cerevisiae genes located in chr. viii, ix and xiii, short chr. iv left region, chr. vii left arm, and chr. xv right arm;  <dig> copies of s. cerevisiae genes located in chr. ii, iii left, iv right, v, vii right, x, xi, xii, xiv, xv left, and xvi; and  <dig> copies of s. cerevisiae genes located in chr. iii left region and in a segment of chr. vii .

according to this combined analysis,  <dig> different patterns were differentiated in the  <dig> hybrids under analysis. as a general rule, different degrees of loss of s. kudriavzevii gene content in most hybrids were observed. only the allotetraploid hybrid pb <dig> maintains a complete diploid set of chromosomes from each parental species, with the exception of a small segment located in the left arm of chromosome xi of the s. kudriavzevii subgenome. on the contrary, the largest reduction of the s. kudriavzevii gene content is observed in the partial allotetraploid hybrid amh, which lost 72% of the s. kudriavzevii genes. the rest of hybrids, all of them allotriploid, showed intermediate situations derived from ancestors containing a diploid set of s. cerevisiae chromosomes and a haploid set of s. kudriavzevii chromosomes.

these combined analyses also allowed us to detect different types of chromosome rearrangements present in hybrids: i) the complete loss of a s. kudriavzevii parental chromosome compensated by an extra copy of the s. cerevisiae chromosome ; ii) aneuploidies , and iii) the presence of chimerical chromosomes ; .

these chimerical chromosomes are characterized by over- and underrepresented regions evidenced as up and down jumps in the log <dig> ratio in the caryoscopes, which are indicative of probable non-reciprocal recombination events between homeologous chromosomes  . the recombination sites in the chimerical chromosomes were mapped according to the genome browser from saccharomyces genome database . using a windows size of 15–20 kb  we found ty elements, ars sequences, clusters of homologous regions  and trna elements that may have facilitated the recombination of the two homologous parental chromosomes . in several cases, a common recombination site was observed in chromosomes belonging to two or more hybrids, indicative of common ancestry. this is the case of chromosomes iv, v, ix, xiv and xv in brewing hybrids cect  <dig> and 11004; chromosome xiv in cect  <dig> and 11002; chromosome xv in cect  <dig>   <dig> and amh and chromosome vii in hybrids cect  <dig>  cect  <dig>  cect  <dig>  cect  <dig> and cect  <dig> .

chr., chromosome number; chr, cluster of homology region. strain names in italics correspond to wine hybrids and in bold to brewing hybrids. some recombination sites were described elsewhere  <cit> , as indicated.

s. cerevisiae gene depletions in hybrids
although hybrids maintain in their genomes at least a complete set of s. cerevisiae chromosomes, acgh data from all hybrids analyzed in this work, as well as from those previously analyzed  <cit> , can be used to determine the common fraction of s. cerevisiae genes showing gene copy variations in hybrids compared to the reference strain s288c. a common set of genes showing the same copy number variations in hybrids may be indicative of common origins.

the analysis of the s. cerevisiae gene content from all hybrids revealed the presence of less copies of a common set of genes. among them, the most interesting were cup <dig>  asp <dig>  and ena gene families, as well as ty elements and  <dig> orfs of unknown function . in general, copy variations in the s. cerevisiae genome fraction of the hybrids were found in genes located in subtelomeric regions , although in some cases involve genes located in intrachromosomal regions, such as cup <dig> 

short segment amplifications were also detected in the acgh analysis. this was the case of hybrid amh that showed three short region amplifications in chr. iii, vii and xiii. the higher hybridization signals of genes located in the two first regions could be postulated as indicative of the presence of chimerical chromosomes, however according to the previous pcr-rflp analysis s. kudriavzevii genes were absent. other amplifications of s. cerevisiae segments located in chromosome xvi are observed in hybrids cect  <dig>  and cect  <dig> . finally, a deleted region was found in one of the two copies of s. cerevisiae chromosome xiv from strain cect  <dig>  .

s. kudriavzevii gene content and gene ontology  analyses
data obtained from all hybrids analyzed in this work as well as from those previously analyzed  <cit>  were also used to evaluate the presence of common s. kudriavzevii genes . these common set of genes could be interesting to unveil potentially genes of adaptive value in hybrids.

as a general rule, most hybrids maintained around 90% of the s. kudriavzevii genome, with the exception of the brewing strain cect  <dig> and the wine strain amh which only maintain  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

to determine if a group of s. kudriavzevii genes associated with particular cellular components, molecular functions or biological processes may have been maintained in all hybrids due to potential adaptive value, four different gene ontology  term enrichment analyses were performed . the first analysis included all wine and brewing hybrids. due to the low representation of the s. kudriavzevii genome fraction in amh, this strain was removed from this first analysis. gene ontology analysis was also separately performed according to the source of isolation of hybrids, wine and brewing fermentations. go terms showing significant values were sorted according to their corresponding go categories . table  <dig> shows only those significantly represented go terms of putative importance for wine or brewing fermentations.

due to the massive s. kudriavzevii gene losses in amh, this strain was not included in any grouping, and hence, analyzed alone.

significantly represented go terms common to both wine and brewing hybrids mainly corresponded to genes related to fatty acid metabolism , sulfur metabolism and the nad+ salvage pathway. genes associated with amino acid metabolism  were also represented .

go terms related to amino acid n-linked glycosilation were also significantly present in hybrids from wine and brewing analyzed independently. moreover, go terms associated with ergosterol biosynthesis and mitochondrial transport were also significantly detected in wine hybrids; while those related to metabolism of amino acids such as glycine, threonine, arginine and proline, sulfur metabolism, as well as fatty acid elongation were significant present in brewing strains . finally, an independent analysis of significant go terms for amh hybrid revealed the presence of genes involved in hyperosmotic response, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase complex, histidine biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism .

phylogenetic relationships among hybrids
a maximum parsimony tree was constructed based in presence/absence of chromosomes and chromosome regions data obtained for each particular genetic event in all analyzed hybrids. the tree topology revealed the presence of two main groups containing most allotriploid hybrids, particularly those from wine .

group i was constituted by swiss wine strains w <dig>   <dig>  w <dig> and spg 16- <dig> as well as the brewing strains cect  <dig> and cect  <dig>  this group is supported by the presence of five shared chimerical chromosomes as well as the cyc <dig> k <dig> allele  <cit> .

group ii includes the remaining allotriploid wine hybrids ha <dig>  ha  <dig>  vin <dig> and soy <dig>  this group is only supported by the common presence of s. kudriavzevii k <dig> alleles for genes eug <dig> and apm <dig> <cit> , and the possession of a higher fraction of s. kudriavzevii genome.

the rest of the allotriploid hybrids, isolated from brewing, and the wine allotetraploid pb <dig> and amh strains, appeared in separated branches with strain-specific chromosomal rearrangements. the only exception is the shared loss of s. kudriavzevii chr. xii between the partial allotetraploid amh and the allotriploid cect  <dig>  which can be considered a convergent event. pb <dig> also shared similar restriction alleles with group ii but this strain is also allotetraploid .

this most parsimonious tree shows several convergent events, such as chromosomal losses, chromosomal rearrangements and restriction site changes . s. kudriavzevii chr. i seems to have been lost independently in hybrids spg  <dig>  cect  <dig>  and amh. in a similar way, the lack of chr. v in hybrids ha  <dig> and amh, and chromosome xiv in cect  <dig> and amh seem to be independent events according to this parsimony analysis.

convergent events involving recombinant chromosomes were also found. this is the case of the type  <dig> recombination in chr. iv , type  <dig> recombination in chr. vii , type  <dig> recombination in chr. xiv  and the recombinant chr. xv . this could be indicative of the presence of recombination hotspots in the saccharomyces genomes.

discussion
the genome diversity in s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids
the genome composition of  <dig> new wine and brewing s. cerevisiae x s. kudriavzevii hybrid strains was described in this work by means of acgh analysis. additionally, a comparison between them and other four wine hybrids already described by  <cit>  was also performed. individual and differential chromosomal composition patterns were found for each particular strain, except for brewing strains cect  <dig> and cect  <dig> which appear closely related to the previously described swiss wine hybrids  <cit> . the close relationships between wine hybrid strains from switzerland and the brewing strains cect  <dig> and  <dig> was already observed in a previous study based on pcr-rflp analysis of hybrids as well as in the phylogenetic reconstruction based on cox <dig> sequences  <cit> . in that work, a recombination in chromosome xv was proposed as the unique difference between strains  <dig> and 11004; however, acgh analysis carried out in this study demonstrated that this recombination is present in both strains . these swiss wine hybrids were previously described as diploids  <cit>  on the basis of ploidy estimations with propidium iodide. however, in the reanalysis of ploidy with sytox green, they also resulted to be allotriploids as cect  <dig> and cect  <dig> 

flow cytometry results with sytox green were in accordance with genome structure deduced from acgh analysis carried out in this work and with the presence/absence of parental genes deduced from a previous pcr-rflp analysis of hybrids  <cit> . most s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrid strains were allotriploids, with the exception of amh and pb <dig> which were allotetraploids. some aneuploidies were also found in several hybrids. aneuploidies seem to be common in saccharomyces hybrids since this phenomenon have also been observed in s. cerevisiae × s. bayanus hybrids  <cit> . the role of aneuploidies in the hybrid genomes is not clear, but their presence in s. cerevisiae affected both the transcriptome and proteome, generating significant phenotypic variation and bringing fitness gains under diverse conditions  <cit> .

recently, the hybrid genome of vin <dig>  one the hybrids analyzed in the present study, has completely been sequenced  <cit> , concluding that this strain is an almost perfect allotriploid hybrid that contains a heterozygous diploid s. cerevisiae genome and a haploid s. kudriavzevii genome. the genome constitution of vin <dig> deduced from the sequencing analysis is basically similar to the one inferred by acgh in the present study, but there are some differences. the genome sequence analysis detected a homeologous recombination generating a chimerical chromosome vii, a genomic substitution of a region of 15 kb, of s. kudriavzevii genomic dna from chromosome iv by the orthologous sequences from s. cerevisiae and a genomic substitution of a 13 kb region of s. cerevisiae genomic dna from chromosome iv by s. kudriavzevii sequences combined with homeologous recombination between the s. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae alleles. the first rearrangement involving a chimerical chromosome vii was clearly detected in the acgh analysis, but not the two genomic substitutions. both genomic substitution involve short segmental replacements of a few genes , and the second an almost reciprocal recombination between homeologous chromosomes that cannot be observed by acgh analysis. however, the presence/absence analysis of parental genes in hybrids  <cit>  detected the loss of s. kudriavzevii chromosome iii in our vin <dig>  as an ongoing project, our group is also sequencing the whole genome of several s. cerevisae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids, including the commercial vin <dig> yeast. we checked in the preliminary sequencing of our vin <dig> strain for the presence of s. kudriavzevii chromosome iii sequences and the result was negative, confirming our acgh results and indicating that our vin <dig> strain is different. these differences may be due to the fact that our vin <dig> strain was isolated from a commercial dry yeast sample provided by anchor yeast but borneman et al.  <cit>  sequenced the original mother culture of vin <dig>  as they mention in their acknowledgements. therefore, the continuous propagation of this yeast in molasses under aerobic conditions to obtain commercial dry yeasts may have promoted a new chromosomal rearrangement, the loss of the s. kudriavzevii chromosome iii.

taking into consideration the ploidy data as well the fact that most hybrids possess either trisomic  or tetrasomic chromosomes , two scenarios on the hybridization process are plausible. in the case of allotriploid hybrids, the simplest explanations for their origins are hybridization events by rare-mating between a diploid cell of s. cerevisiae and a haploid cell or spore of s. kudriavzevii. this is also supported by the genome sequencing of vin <dig>  one of the allotriploid strains, which resulted to contain heterozygous diploid genome from s. cerevisiae and a haploid genome from s. kudriavzevii <cit> .

on the other hand, diploid and diploid cell rare-mating between s. cerevisiae and s. kudriavzevii should be invoked to explain the origin of allotetraploid hybrids. in the case of pb <dig> it was observed high spore viability  due to the presence of the two chromosomes copies of each parental strain.

rare-mating between diploid cells was already proposed as a probable mechanism for hybrids generation  <cit> . however, haploid cell or spore mating between s. cerevisiae and s. kudriavzevii, followed by whole genome duplications due to endoreplication or chromosome duplications due to non-disjunction, and subsequent chromosomal rearrangements, although less plausible, cannot totally be discarded.

characterization of the s. kudriavzevii subgenome from hybrids
according to sipiczki  <cit> , genomes from each parental species interact in the new hybrid genome. this interaction can be observed in the loss of large parts of one or both genomes as well as in the presence of chimerical chromosomes that make the hybrid genome as stable as possible to future genetic modifications. additionally, adaptive evolution of these hybrid genomes under fermentative environmental conditions could make hybrid genome to conserve the chromosomes, or part of them, which grant a selective advantage  <cit> . according to the results obtained in this work as well as in our previous studies  <cit> , s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids seem to have the common trend to lose the s. kudriavevii parental chromosomes maintaining the s. cerevisiae ones. the reduction of the non-s. cerevisiae genome observed in both wine and brewing s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids was already reported for artificial s. cerevisiae × s. uvarum hybrids genetically stabilized by successive sporulation steps  <cit> . in contrast, s. pastorianus  group  <dig> strains obtained from different brewing processes and studied by acgh analysis, showed a trend to lose the s. cerevisiae genome fraction  <cit> . the cause of the predominance of one or the other parental genome in the hybrids remains unclear yet. however, selective pressures acting under harsh environmental conditions and cytonuclear interactions have been suggested as the main factors affecting the genome conformation of hybrids. in s. cerevisiae × s. eubayanus lager strains, supposed to be naturally selected after years of use in brewing, the predominance of a s. eubayanus-like genome has been related to the maintenance of the s. eubayanus mitochondria  <cit> . however, artificial hybrids constructed from the same two parental species, but without selective pressures, inherited their mitochondrial genome from either one or the other parental species randomly  <cit> . the conservation of the mitochondrial genome from the parental species most represented in the nuclear genome was also observed in the stable artificial s. cerevisiae × s. uvarum hybrids, which maintained the mitochondrial genome of the s. cerevisiae parental strain  <cit> . all s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii natural hybrids analyzed in this work, except for amh, maintained a s. kudriavzevii mitochondrial genome  <cit> . however, s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii artificial hybrids, randomly inherited the s. cerevisiae or the s. kudriavzevii mitochondrial dna . this discrepancy between the mtdna inheritance in artificial vs. natural hybrids has been associated with the result of an unwitting human-driven selection of naturally generated hybrid strains for fermentations at low temperature  <cit> . a common origin for all hybrids could be another possible explanation, but the present analysis of the genome constitutions in hybrids suggests diverse origins.

interestingly, the hybrid amh, which maintained the s. cerevisiae mitochondria, has lost a 69% of the nuclear genes of s. kudriavzevii coding for proteins with functions associated to the mitochondria; while the rest of the analyzed hybrids with s. kudriavzevii mitochondria have lost only  <dig> %– <dig> % of the s. kudriavzevii genes related to mitochondrial functions. due to the fact that a number of mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nuclear genome play an important role in the mtdna replication and transmission, both the type of mitochondrial dnas and the functions of the mitochondria in a hybrid strain are clearly under the control of the nuclear genome  <cit> . one of the most interesting evidence about nuclear-mitochondrial genome interactions were described by lee et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that the presence of the s. bayanus nuclear gene aep <dig> together with the s. cerevisiae mitochondrial gene oli <dig> cause a cytonuclear incompatibility. more recently, chou et al.  <cit>  identified other two genes, mrs <dig> and aim <dig>  associated with cytonuclear incompatibility among s. cerevisiae, s. paradoxus and s. bayanus. a similar behavior involving the same or other different genes in s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids was not yet demonstrated.

acgh and go analysis carried out with those s. kudriavzevii genes conserved in all s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids with s. kudriavzevii mitochondria  evidenced a significant enrichment in nuclear genes related to mitochondrial function  supporting the hypothesis of a necessary interaction between the s. kudriavzevii nuclear-encoded proteins and the mitochondrial genomes or their products. taking into consideration that a total of  <dig> proteins encoded by the nuclear genome are associated with the mitochondrial function in s. cerevisiae <cit> , and considering a similar number in s. kudriavzevii, we can assume that the remaining genes up to  <dig> might be non-essential for the maintenance of the s. kudriavzevii mitochondria in hybrids. in particular the s. kudriavzevii gene aep <dig> reported by lee et al.  <cit>  was not common to all analyzed hybrids, indicating that different incompatible nuclear-mitochondrial pair of genes could be associated with each particular pair of saccharomyces parental species involved in hybrid generation.

go analysis was also very informative with regards to the conservation in hybrids of particular groups of genes, inherited from each parental species, that may be potentially related to adaptive advantage for fermentation at low temperatures. a significant overrepresentation of s. kudriavzevii genes associated with the physiological adaptation of yeasts to grow at low temperatures, such as fatty acid transport and n-glycosilation of proteins in all hybrids, and ergosterol biosynthesis in the case of wine hybrids  <cit>  was observed . changes in membrane fluidity are the primary signal triggering the cold shock response  <cit> . this response involves certain groups of genes: members of the dan/tir family of cell-wall mannoproteins, genes coding for temperature inducible protein  and seripauperins , genes related to ergosterol and phospholipid synthesis  and the gene coding for the only known desaturase in s. cerevisiae , among others  <cit> . these sets of genes are present in the s. kudriavzevii subgenome of all hybrids analyzed in this work, with some exceptions mainly involving amh .

our results are in agreement with results about stress olerance, including adaptation to low temperatures, previously obtained in our laboratory using some of the s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids analyzed in this work  <cit> . physiological implications of possessing s. kudriavzevii genes in those particular functions or metabolic pathways must be elucidated in future studies involving both transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses.

wine yeast signatures in the s. cerevisiae subgenome from hybrids
an interesting result obtained from acgh analysis was the detection of a common set of s. cerevisiae genes that are in lower copies in the genome of all s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids . this finding might indicate that the s. cerevisiae parental strains involved in the different hybridization events shared a similar genetic background and were closely related yeasts.

using a similar methodology, a trend to loss some particular set of genes in s. cerevisiae wine strains, with regards to strains belonging to the same species but isolated from different sources, was previously demonstrated  <cit> . dunn et al.  <cit>  proposed the term “commercial wine yeast signature” to refer to this set of genes. most of these genes that are frequently depleted in wine strains are also depleted in the s. cerevisiae fraction of the hybrid genomes of all hybrids. this finding supports the hypothesis that these hybrids have likely been generated from wine s. cerevisiae parental strains.

on the origin of hybrids
the maximum parsimony analysis of the relationships between the wine and beer hybrids are congruent with diverse origins for the strains according to chromosomal rearrangement differences, mainly due to the presence of chimerical chromosomes, and s. kudriavzevii chromosome losses, in some cases compensated by the presence of an extra copy of the homeologous s. cerevisiae chromosome .

while the brewing strains seem to represent different and divergent lines , most wine hybrids clustered in two main groups of strains sharing common events, with the exception of amh and pb <dig> that were independently originated. brewing strains cect  <dig> and  <dig> shared the same genome than wine hybrid w <dig> probably evidencing that either an original strain with this common genome structure was introduced in both fermentative processes, or colonize one fermentative process from the other. the parsimony tree obtained in this study is congruent with previous phylogenetic reconstructions of hybrids based on cox <dig> sequences  <cit> .

the occurrence of several chimerical chromosomes sharing similar—if not the same—recombination points, common to some s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii hybrids located in different branches of the parsimony tree, indicates the presence of recombination hot spots. recombination between homeologous chromosomes are probably mediated by highly recombining regions located in the recombination sites, such as ars sequences  <cit> , ty elements  <cit> , y’ elements, rrna regions and conserved coding genes  <cit> . when recombination is initiated in a region with high homology, the mismatch repair system  stimulates the loss of one partner of the recombination event in the hybrids and the fixation of the other, thus generating a chimerical recombinant chromosome. with the exception of the almost perfect allotetraploid pb <dig>  hybrids have low spore viability  indicating that they are maintained by mitotic budding. therefore, mitotic homeologous recombination, although much less frequent than meiotic, may also explain the generation of chimerical chromosomes.

the genome composition of hybrids reveals that the ancestral hybrid strains were allotriploid or allotetraploid, resulting from rare mating between diploid s. cerevisiae and haploid or diploid s. kudriavzevii <cit> . the presence of triple hybrids also supports this hypothesis  <cit> . finally, the presence of s. kudriavzevii alleles shared between most hybrids and the european s. kudriavzevii population  <cit> , as well as the presence of the gene gal <dig> from s. kudriavzevii <cit> , which is a functional gene in the european populations of s. kudriavzevii but a pseudogene in the japanese strains  <cit> , indicate that these hybrids were originated from a european s. kudriavzevii parental strain.

CONCLUSIONS
hybridization between s. cerevisiae and s. kudriavzevii have occurred several times by rare-mating between different wine s. cerevisiae diploid and european s. kudriavzevii haploid or diploid progenitors. after hybridization, the hybrid genome suffered random genomic rearrangements mediated by crossing-over between homologous chromosomes and non-disjunction, promoting the loss of variable fractions of the parental subgenomes. both the restrictions imposed byinteractions between both parental genomes as well as between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, together with the selective environmental conditions prevailing during fermentation modulated the final composition of the hybrid genomes, characterized by the maintaining of the s. cerevisiae genome and the progressive reduction of the s. kudriavzevii contribution.
