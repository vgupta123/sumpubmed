BACKGROUND
colorectal cancer  is the third most common cancer in the world  <cit> . it accounts for more than  <dig> , <dig> new cancer incidences and about 9% of all cancer deaths worldwide  <cit> , . the risk of crc increases with age, and crc incidence rates are higher among males, than females  <cit> . crc starts in either the colon or the rectum and is represented by several histological types. more than 90% of crc are adenocarcinomas  <cit> . generally crc patients are characterized by a lack of clinical symptoms in early stages, and this leads to poor prognosis and high mortality rate  <cit> . approximately 20% of patients with crc have already developed metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis  <cit> . colorectal cancer metastases are found in the liver, lung, skin, and brain  <cit> . the median survival of patients with advanced metastatic disease is less than 24 months  <cit> . although the medical management of crc has improved, there are limited therapeutic options for advanced crc. identification of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers is imperative for the development of crc therapies and diagnosis.

energy metabolism in cancer cells is characterized by increased glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis  <cit> . even in the presence of oxygen, most cancer cells produce lactate instead of oxidation of glycolytic pyruvate in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid  cycle  <cit> . this phenomenon was originally observed by otto warburg and termed the “warburg effect”  <cit> . increased aerobic glycolysis is associated with the alteration of gene expression, protein modifications and mutations  <cit> . warburg effect is the tumor adaptation mechanism to oxidative stress and hypoxia  <cit> . each type of cancer is characterized by a distinct metabolic signature due to its unique transformation process  <cit> . elucidation of the metabolic specificities of several cancers and metabolic differences between cancer and normal cells has provided important biomarker findings  <cit> .

the aim of the study was to identify tumor-associated expression of alternatively spliced transcripts related to energy metabolism in crc. obtained data suggest several ones that could be involved in the development of crc through altered energy metabolism. identified tumor-specific mrna isoforms may be used for the development of cancer diagnosis and treatment methods.

methods
bioinformatics analysis
we analyzed tcga rna-seq datasets  for colon cancer using crosshub software  <cit> . here is a brief description of tcga rna-seq version  <dig> pipeline. illumina reads were aligned to hg <dig> ucsc reference genome using mapsplice  <cit> . the alignment results were translated to transcriptome coordinates prior to transcript level quantification using the unc bioinformatics utilities . rsem was used to estimate gene and transcript abundances  <cit> . the further analysis of read count data was performed using crosshub  <cit> . read counts were normalized with tmm  method and then two expression test were performed: for two pools of samples and for paired samples only . we excluded lowly expressed isoforms; only genes with at least  <dig> reads in each of 50% samples  have passed expression level threshold. then comparison of trimmed  mean of expression values between normal and tumor tissues using t-test was performed. behjamini-hochberg p-value adjustment was performed in order to calculate fdr. we selected only isoforms with concordant results in paired and pooled tests.

the selection of genes participating cell energy metabolism was performed using gene ontology database and the following keywords: glucose, glycolytic, glycolysis, cell respiration, respiratory, tca cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, krebs. finally, a set of  <dig> genes with  <dig> alternatively spliced transcripts was selected for the further analysis. unfortunately, tcga read count data were derived for the previous genome assembly  using ucsc genome annotation. when possible, ucsc transcript identifiers were converted to refseq accession numbers. using crosshub, we analyzed associations with disease stage, follow-up status, tnm indexes. we paid special attention to the alternatively spliced transcripts that are strongly overexpressed in colon tumors against the background of low changes in overall gene expression level or its down-regulation.

tissue specimens
a total of  <dig> colorectal,  <dig> breast,  <dig> non-small cell lung,  <dig> prostate, and  <dig> kidney cancer specimens and matched morphologically normal tissues were obtained after surgical resection prior to radiation or chemotherapy. the samples were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. the morphological classification of the tumor was performed according to the american joint committee on cancer  staging system  <cit> . only samples with 70% or more tumor cells were studied. written informed consent was obtained from all patients. the study was approved by the ethics committee of herzen moscow cancer research institute, ministry of health of the russian federation. the study was done in accordance with the principles outlined in the declaration of helsinki . the sample information for colorectal tumors is presented in table  <dig> table  <dig> clinicopathologic characteristics of crc patients

isolation of rna and cdna synthesis
total rna was isolated from frozen tissues using rneasy mini kit  according to manufacturer's instructions. rna quality was measured using the rin method  on agilent rna bioanalyzer  <dig> . the rna quantification was carried out on a nanodrop  <dig> . cdna synthesis was done using m-mlv reverse transcriptase  and random hexamers.

quantitative pcr
gene and transcript expression levels were estimated by quantitative pcr  analysis. all probes contained the dye fam at 5′-end and rtq <dig> at 3′-end. specific primer pairs and probes were synthesized for the alternative splicing isoforms of target genes . primers and probes for reference genes were designed as previously described  <cit> . pcr was carried out in triplicates on ab  <dig> real-time pcr system  following the manufacturer's instructions. pcr program was as follows: 10 min at 95 °c and then  <dig> two-step cycles 15 s at 95 °c and 60 s at 60 °c. the total reaction volume was 20 μl in triplicate. pcr products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels, purified and submitted for sanger sequencing on abi prism  <dig> genetic analyzer .table  <dig> primer and probe sets for qpcr analysis

analysis of qpcr data
the relative quantitation software  and atg  tool were used to analyze the obtained qpcr data taking into account the efficiency of the pcr amplification  <cit> . the expression levels of target genes were normalized to gapdh and actb reference genes and finally relative  expression level of target genes was calculated using ΔΔc
t method. the relative inner variability between mrna levels of reference genes do not exceed two times, and, therefore, 2-fold or more expression alterations of the target genes/isoforms were considered significant. inter-group and intra-group comparisons were performed using nonparametric wilcoxon/mann-whitney u–test and kruskal-wallis test. differences with p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant. the statistical procedures were performed with biostat software .

RESULTS
analysis of tcga data with crosshub
differential expression profiles were derived for  <dig> genes  which participate in cell energy metabolism.  <dig> tumor and 41 matched normal colon tissue samples were used in the analysis. among differentially expressed transcripts, we paid a special attention to the following eight mrna isoforms, which were overexpressed in colon tumors: ogdh , col6a <dig> , icam <dig> , phpt <dig> , ppp2r5d , slc29a <dig> , trib <dig> . most of them are minor mrna isoforms that are selectively up-regulated against the background of intact or under-expressed other isoforms and intact expression of entire gene . the list of logfc, p-values, fdr, cpm, rna-seq expression profiles and associations with clinical characteristics is provided in the additional file  <dig>  differential expression of these transcripts was further validated with qpcr. most of the selected isoforms have unique splice event which do not occur in the other isoforms . this allows accurate detection and quantification of these transcripts with spliced reads spanning this unique exon junction.


ogdh  mrna isoform uc011kby lacks three exons and this unique feature allows quantification of this transcripts with rna-seq data. compared to the reference isoform , the protein encoded with uc011kby transcript lacks three regions: 75– <dig> a.a., 139– <dig> a.a., and 211– <dig> a.a. full-length isoform of ogdh is normally regulated by ca2+, adenine nucleotides, and nadh. mutations in the second region  results in 6-fold decrease of calcium sensitivity  <cit> . transcript uc003owz is very minor isoform of slc29a <dig> mrna . the first exon of this transcript almost completely covers cpg island in the promotor region of slc29a <dig>  frequent induction of this minor isoform suggests altered mechanisms of slc29a <dig> expression regulation in colon tumors.

two other transcripts of interest, uc010xle and uc010jyd are minor isoforms of icam <dig>  and ppp2r5d  genes, respectively. compared to the major isoforms, they do not include some exons. as the result, protein encoded with icam <dig> uc010xle has deletion at 22– <dig> a.a.  which spans two ig-like c2-type domains. the signal peptide sequence is almost completely kept . this isoform is strongly overexpressed in tumor  whereas major isoform is overexpressed only  <dig> -times . protein encoded with ppp2r5d transcript uc010jyd has deletion at 10– <dig> a.a. .

up-regulation of eight alternative mrna transcripts in crc
quantitative expression estimation was performed for eight alternative mrna isoforms of seven genes involved in energy metabolism in crc . bioinformatics results showed good concordance with qpcr results. all the transcripts showed up-regulation in more than 50% of crc cases . the highest frequency and extent of the mrna level increase were observed for alternative transcripts of col6a <dig> , trib <dig> , and slc29a <dig>  genes.fig  <dig> up-regulation of eight alternative mrna transcripts in crc. ogdh: uc011kby/ak <dig>  col6a3: uc002vwo/nm_ <dig>  icam1: uc010xle/ak <dig>  phpt1: uc004cjq/nm_ <dig>  ppp2r5d: uc010jyd/nm_ <dig>  slc29a1: uc003owz/nm_ <dig>  trib3: uc002wdm/nm_ <dig> and uc002wdn/ak297546

simultaneous up-regulation of alternative mrna transcripts in colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancers
to evaluate the possibility of tumor-specific expression of alternative transcripts, we analyzed their expression in breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancers. we revealed the significantly increased expression of alternative mrna isoform uc002vwo/nm_ <dig> of col6a <dig> in all these tumors . the mrna level of the transcript was up-regulated in  <dig> %  of breast,  <dig> %  of lung,  <dig> %  of prostate, and 50%  of kidney cancer samples.fig  <dig> up-regulation of the col6a <dig> alternative transcript uc002vwo/nm_ <dig> in breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancers




we also observed the increased expression of two alternative transcripts  in all the cancers with one exception . we found that the uc002wdm/nm_ <dig>  mrna level was increased in  <dig> % , 50% , and  <dig> %  cases of breast, prostate, and kidney cancers, respectively. the stable expression of uc002wdm/nm_ <dig>  was detected in most cases of lung cancer. the up-regulation of uc010xle/ak <dig>  level was detected in breast , prostate , and kidney  cancers. the alternative transcript uc010xle/ak <dig>  was differentially expressed in lung cancer; the mrna level of one was increased in  <dig> %  and decreased in 40% . the expression of uc003owz/nm_ <dig> slc29a <dig> transcript was not significantly changed in more than 50% cases of all tumors studied, but was up-regulated in  <dig> %  colorectal cancer samples .fig  <dig> relative mrna levels of the trib <dig> alternative transcript uc002wdm/nm_ <dig> and icam1 alternative transcript uc010xle/ak <dig> in breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancers

discussion
alternative splicing plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes and development programs  <cit> . in recent years, alternative splicing has been recognized to contribute to many human disorders, including cancer  <cit> . alternative splicing is one more mechanism that allows expressing transcripts involved in the regulation of apoptosis, signaling pathways and cellular metabolism  <cit> . changes in splicing patterns occur widely in cancer cells and was shown to be associated with the resistance to therapeutic treatments  <cit> . alterations in the trans-acting splicing regulatory elements are the most frequent in cancer  <cit> . mutations in various splicing regulatory factors such as u2af <dig>  zrsr <dig>  srsf <dig>  sf3b <dig>  and rbm <dig> have been described in multiple tumor types . overexpression of a positive splicing factor, serine/arginine-rich , was found in colorectal, thyroid, small intestine, kidney, and lung cancers  <cit> . on the other hand, an alternative splicing repressor, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein , was primary down-regulated in these tumor types. mutations in cis-acting splicing elements were shown in both oncogenes  and tumor suppressors , which have causal role in cancer initiation and progression  <cit> . cancer-associated alterations of splicing patterns have been also reported for other cancer-related genes  <cit> . for instance, it has been shown that splicing pattern of ron and rac <dig> genes were altered in tumors and overexpression of their tumor-associated isoforms was sufficient to culture cell transformation  <cit> . the alternatively spliced isoforms of mdm2/hdm <dig> gene, that is a regulator of p <dig> protein, have been identified in many cancers. moreover, some of their protein products were shown to have transforming properties  <cit> .

alternative splicing is known contributor to cancer pathogenesis. for instance, activation of splicing factor hnrnp by egfrviii mutation promotes glycolytic gene expression in glioblastoma  <cit> . alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase m  pre-mrna generates the pkm <dig> isoform in all cancer cells  <cit> . pkm <dig> is a critical enzyme for aerobic glycolysis that mediates warburg effect and facilitates tumor growth  <cit> . pkm <dig> is highly expressed in embryonic and tumor cells, whereas pkm <dig> is primarily expressed in normal tissues  <cit> . splicing repressors hnrnpa <dig> and hnrnpa <dig> have been found to regulate pkm alternative splicing in cancer cells  <cit> . down-regulation of these factors in cancer cells resulted in an increase in the pkm1/pkm <dig> protein ratio and decrease in lactate production  <cit> . these data indicate that alternative splicing is involved in the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in cancer. mitochondrial damage modulates alternative splicing in neuronal cells leading to changes in the abundance of certain isoforms  <cit> . thus, mitochondrial dysfunction, as a notable feature of cancer, may be also the mechanism underlying the changes in alternative splicing patterns.

our study revealed tumor-associated changes in alternative splicing patterns of seven genes involved in energy metabolism, including ogdh, col6a <dig>  icam <dig>  phpt <dig>  ppp2r5d, slc29a <dig>  and trib <dig>  ogdh gene encodes a subunit of the multi-enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex  that is the first and rate-limiting component of one  <cit> . ogdhc plays a major role in tca cycle and involved in the regulation of the glutamine and glutamate metabolism  <cit> . ogdhc is often implied to be inactive in cancer  <cit> . oncogenic mutations reduce the enzyme activity of nadp+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases isoforms  <dig> and  <dig>  resulting in increased 2-hydroxyglutarate levels and decreased concentrations of the ogdhc substrate 2-oxoglutarate  <cit> . in a previous study, we showed that ogdhl, encoding one more component of the ogdhc, is down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation in crc  <cit> . the promoter hypermethylation in ogdhl gene was also observed in breast, cervix, lung, oesophagus, and pancreas cancers  <cit> . it has been shown that re-expression of ogdhl induced apoptosis through a pi3k/akt pathway in cervical cancer cells  <cit> . the alterations in ogdhc expression were shown to be functional in various cancer cells  <cit> . thus, we assumed that up-regulation of ogdh alternative mrna transcript may indicate the presence of active ogdh complex in colorectal cancer that is required to control energy and glutamine metabolism.

overexpression of slc29a <dig> alternative transcript was found in colorectal cancer and was not significantly changed in breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancers. transporter slc29a <dig> has been reported relating to multidrug resistance . significant up-regulation of slc29a <dig> in colorectal, astroglial, and breast cancer cells contributed to cisplatin resistance and increased cell viability  <cit> . on the other hand, knockdown of slc29a <dig> reduced sensitivity of leukemia and lung cancer to drugs since it plays a role in cellular uptake  <cit> . increased slc29a <dig> mrna level was suggested as a critical factor of pancreatic and biliary tract cancer cells sensitivity to chemotherapy  <cit> . the expression of slc29a <dig> alternative transcripts in cancer has not been previously analyzed. we first observed the tumor-specific up-regulation of the uc003owz/nm_ <dig> slc29a <dig> transcript in crc. the functional role of a protein encoded by the transcript in crc is not obvious. the further investigation will address how the transcript is associated with the resistance and sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to therapy by various agents and may be useful for prediction of its efficacy.

using qpcr method, we showed the tumor-specific overexpression of uc002vwo/nm_ <dig> col6a <dig> alternative transcript in colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancers. collagen vi, a protein of the extracellular matrix , is significant in the progression of cancer and resistance to chemotherapy  <cit> . col6a <dig> encodes one of the three α chains of type vi collagen which is involved in the regulation of metabolic health by ecm  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that col6a <dig> was up-regulated in gastric, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers . exon array analysis revealed the expression of col6a <dig> alternative long isoform in colon, bladder, pancreatic, and prostate cancers  <cit> .

intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig> icam <dig>  is known to play a major role in immune response, inflammation, regulation of energy balance, and angiogenesis . increased levels of icam <dig> were reported in several human malignances and cancer cell lines  <cit> . in melanoma and gastric cancer, icam <dig> expression was associated with an increase in metastases  <cit> . this can be explained by icam1-mediated activation of leukocytes and induction of cell migration  <cit> . on the other hand, immunohistochemistry studies reported better prognosis for patients with icam1-positive tumors  . cancer cell can expresses and release soluble icam <dig>  that is regulated by tnf-α and inf-γ  <cit> . it is an essential mechanism used by tumors to escape immune recognition  <cit> . for example, elevated serum levels of icam <dig> in colorectal cancer patients were correlated with tumor stage and tendency to metastasis formation  <cit> . thus, icam <dig> seems to have different roles in tumorigenesis. tumor-specific expression of icam <dig> alternative splice variants was not previously reported. we found up-regulation of uc010xle/ak <dig> icam <dig> alternative splice isoform in colorectal, breast, prostate, and kidney cancers that may be important prognostic factor.


phpt <dig> and ppp2r5d genes encode proteins belonging to phosphatase activity and glucose metabolism . phpt <dig> has been found to be overexpressed in lung cancer and playing a role in cancer progression, migration and invasion  <cit> . ppp2r5d gene, encoding a regulatory b subunit of protein phosphatase 2a , was reported to be involved in myc activation and degradation  <cit> . we first showed up-regulation of phpt <dig> and ppp2r5d alternative transcripts in colorectal cancer.

the protein encoded by trib <dig> gene is tribbles pseudokinase- <dig> that has been proposed as inhibitor of akt and interaction partner of transcription factors  that regulate cell growth, differentiation and metabolism . schwarzer and co-authors showed that trib <dig> emerges as a transcriptional target of pi3k/akt signaling pathway and is involved in regulation of glucose metabolism  <cit> . recent studies reported that increase in trib <dig> expression promoted cancer cell death through apoptosis . genetic inhibition of trib <dig> resulted in activation of mtorc2/akt/foxo pathway and was associated with more aggressive phenotype in several animal models of cancer  <cit> . however, trib <dig> was up-regulated in crc samples, gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer cell lines  <cit> . these data are consistent with the overexpression of both trib <dig> alternative splice variants in crc observed in this study. thus, tumor-associated changes in alternative splicing lead to overexpression of certain trib <dig> splice isoforms which can be involved in development of colorectal cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, using our previously developed bioinformatics tools and tcga data, we evaluated alternative splicing profiles of genes associated with energy metabolism in crc samples and then validated the results by qpcr. differential expression of the transcripts of seven genes  was confirmed. alternative transcript uc003owz/ nm_ <dig> of slc29a <dig> was characterized with tumor-specific overexpression in crc that can be associated with drug resistance and sensitivity. changes in alternative splicing patterns of ogdh gene may play an important role in the regulation of energy and glutamine metabolism in crc. overexpression of col6a <dig> alternative transcript in all examined tumor types indicates its significant contribution to disease development and pathogenesis. increase in expression of phpt <dig>  ppp2r5d, and two trib <dig> transcripts indicates that tumor-associated changes in alternative splicing can affect glucose metabolism in colorectal cancer. several alternative transcripts may be suggested as potential cancer biomarkers, although further studies must be performed to confirm these results.
