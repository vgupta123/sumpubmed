BACKGROUND
the recent release of two blackberry  cultivars with the novel trait, primocane fruiting  <cit> , has the potential to significantly expand the blackberry industry. all other blackberry cultivars produce fruit in the summer on canes called floricanes, canes that grew the year before. primocane-fruiting cultivars produce fruit on floricanes and then produce a smaller second crop in late summer and early fall on canes that emerged in spring and are just a few months old, thereby extending the potential fruit production period for growers, marketers, and consumers. alternatively, canes can be mown to the ground in late fall, and the year's entire crop can be produced on canes that emerge the following spring. because the canes escape winter injury, blackberry production of this type could expand into areas previously thought to be too cold for growing blackberries. the potential effect on the industry of expanding blackberry production both seasonally and geographically has led to a desire to develop new cultivars combining primocane fruiting with other important traits like thornlessness.

the allele conferring primocane fruiting is recessive  <cit> , thus four copies are needed for a tetraploid, tetrasomic blackberry cultivar to produce fruit on primocanes. expression of the trait is affected by environment and plant vigor so that progeny from cross pollinations cannot always be identified visually the first or even the second fruiting year. if thousands of progeny are to be evaluated each year, it would be helpful to eliminate undesirable genotypes as early as possible. therefore, primocane fruiting would be an excellent candidate for marker-assisted selection. using multiple markers around the locus, blackberry breeders could identify progeny that should be primocane fruiting or carry the trait in the heterozygous state.

until the development of primocane-fruiting cultivars, pro-active interest in molecular marker linkage map development for cultivated blackberry has been lacking and no blackberry linkage maps have been published to date. yet, in spite of its highly heterozygous tetraploid genome, blackberry is a good candidate for the development of marker-assisted selection. in fact, blackberry breeders already use a similar method to select seedlings with another very important trait for the industry, thornlessness. like primocane fruiting, inheritance of thornlessness is through a recessive allele at a single locus  <cit> . selection for thornlessness can be done at the seedling stage based on the absence of cotyledon marginal hairs. the two traits are thought to be very closely linked rather than the epistatic effects of alleles at a single locus, because a very small number of seedlings without cotyledonary hairs will later produce thorns . thus, a sort of morphological marker-assisted-selection has been used by blackberry breeders for many years, suggesting molecular marker-assisted selection for a trait like primocane fruiting has the potential for adoption.

linkage of a molecular marker to primocane fruiting or any other trait can be established with the use of linkage mapping strategies such as the single dose restriction fragment mapping method  <cit>  or with software specifically designed for use with tetrasomic species, such as tetraploid map  <cit> . due to double reduction, a well saturated blackberry map derived from multiple populations will be a map of chromosome arms rather than whole chromosomes, but useful marker linkages to important traits are still quite possible.

both molecular linkage maps and molecular markers derived from blackberry sequences are either nonexistent or unavailable. a low percentage of simple sequence repeat  primer pairs developed from other related species such as strawberry  have amplified products from blackberry, fewer than a third of those tested  <cit> . of the  <dig> ssrs derived from the r. idaeus subsp. idaeus l. , cultivar glen moy  <cit> , no more than 26% amplify a product from either of two blackberry genotypes tested, and of the  <dig> rosoideae ssr primer pairs tested in that study, only 18% detected polymorphisms between the two blackberry genotypes  <cit> .

lewers et al.,  <cit>  generated ssr markers from strawberry est sequences deposited in genbank and used them to amplify strawberry dna. strawberry, blackberry and raspberry belong to the same sub-family, rosoideae. approximately 14% of the strawberry ests then in genbank contained ssrs with at least five repeats of the motif. of the primer pairs designed from sequences with six or more repeats, 68% detected polymorphisms among tested accessions, and, of the primer pairs designed from fewer than six repeats, 43% detected polymorphisms. therefore, it is reasonable to expect that useful ssr markers could be developed from blackberry ests, and that a number sufficient for genetic mapping could be expected, given that enough ests are generated. however, currently no blackberry sequences that might be used for molecular marker development have been deposited in genbank. the objective of this work, therefore, was to develop a blackberry est library and use the resulting sequences to develop ssr markers.

RESULTS
quantification of the rna and library
the amount of total rna extracted from  <dig>  g of blackberry leaves was  <dig>  mg, and  <dig>  μg of mrna was separated from the pooled total rna. the resulting yield of cdna from reverse transcription of the  <dig>  μg mrna was  <dig> ng. the entire  <dig> ng was ligated with  <dig> ng of pdonr <dig> vector and transformation yielded  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony forming units. a survey of the size of the insert in  <dig> clones revealed an average insert size of  <dig>  kbp as assessed by restriction enzyme digestion and ranged from approximately  <dig> bases to over  <dig> kb long.

sequence analysis, contig assembly, and homology
after trimming,  <dig> high quality sequences  were obtained from the  <dig>  clones selected for sequencing. the  <dig>  highest quality sequences over  <dig> bp in length are reported as ff <dig> through ff <dig> in genbank. the average read length was  <dig> bp with an average phred value of  <dig>  the lower sequencing success is most likely due to the inherent formation of a secondary structure associated with the pdonr <dig> vector. of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig>  were similar  to sequences previously deposited in genbank, while  <dig>  were not. of the  <dig> sequences that were similar to others in genbank,  <dig>  were similar to putative proteins of unknown function. when the  <dig> sequences were assembled into contigs,  <dig>  were assembled into  <dig> contigs, while  <dig> singletons  remained separate . of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig>  were similar to sequences in genbank while  <dig>  were not. of the  <dig> contigs that were similar to other sequences in genbank,  <dig> , containing  <dig> clones, were annotated as having an unknown function.

the contig sequence similarities to previously reported genes were ordered by relative abundance, as determined by the number of ests in the contigs , and were then grouped by their putative functional categories   <cit> . among the most abundant mrnas cloned, sequenced, and assembled into contigs were those involved with energy . five contigs, consisting of  <dig> clones , had sequence similarity to the ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase  small subunit, key to the calvin cycle of photosynthesis. the functional category of second greatest abundance was cell structure, especially those associated with chloroplasts. seventeen contigs, consisting of  <dig> clones , had sequence similarity to a chlorophyll a/b binding protein. these results are not surprising considering that the cdna library was made from rna from leaf tissue.

the third largest functional category, with  <dig> clones assembled into  <dig> contigs, was disease and defense related. within this functional category, the majority of contigs  were similar to genes involved with stress response, with  <dig> clones having similarity to heat shock proteins. again, this is perhaps not surprising considering leaf tissue for library construction was collected from plants in july in the middle of the afternoon. other contigs with similarity to disease and defense related genes include four  similar to genes associated with heavy metals, four  similar to detoxification genes, and four  similar to disease resistance genes. the large number of clones related to disease and defense suggests that this library will also be useful for studying genes potentially associated with tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses.

ssr identification and testing
a total of  <dig>  ssrs with 40–60% gc content and at least  <dig> base pairs of sequence on either side of the motif were detected and selected for primer design. some sequences and the resulting primers were due to duplications either of the same amplification region in the sequence or two repeat regions in the same sequence. duplications that were of the same repeat region and used the same primers were eliminated while primer pairs that amplified different regions in the same sequence and different primer pairs that amplified the same region were retained. retention of these primer pairs was considered valuable to ensure that one working pair for each region was identified and to allow amplification of gene family members. there were  <dig> primer pairs of this type and  <dig> primer pairs that were designed from unique sequences for a total of  <dig> ssr containing sequences, about 22% of the  <dig>  total high-quality sequences. the percentage of ssr-containing sequences is slightly higher that what was reported for strawberry   <cit>  and for apple    <cit> , two other rosaceous species, and such estimates can vary depending on methods used to search ests for ssrs  <cit> .

assuming that the presence of an ssr region does not affect relative abundance of the individual mrna in the pool, then the  <dig> ssr-containing sequences can be expected to be assembled into contigs in the same proportion and manner as did the total  <dig> high-quality sequences obtained. therefore, about 31%  are expected to be members of  <dig> contigs, while 69%  are expected to remain separate. assuming that the sequences assembled into contigs are indeed part of the same gene and locus we can expect  <dig> plus  <dig>  a total of  <dig> primer pairs, to amplify products from unique genomic regions.

to test the efficacy of the primer pairs,  <dig> were chosen randomly from the larger subset of  <dig> primer pairs. sixteen of the sequences were part of nine contigs formed when the entire  <dig>  sequences were considered. considering only the subset of  <dig> sequences, eleven sequences formed three contigs , fitting expectations based on the entire library. of the  <dig> ssr primer pairs tested with 'apf-12' and 'arapaho' dna,  <dig>  amplified a product, a somewhat low rate  <cit> . of these  <dig>  nine detected at least one size polymorphism, and one primer pair amplified a product from one but not the other genotype, for a total of  <dig> primer pairs detecting polymorphisms, around 30% of the randomly selected  <dig> 

for one of the three contigs, contig  <dig>  with sequence similarity to a chlorophyll a/b-binding precursor, only half the primer pairs amplified products and did not detect polymorphisms. the other two contigs, contigs  <dig> and  <dig>  contained two sequences each, and primer pairs from both sequences in each contig amplified products, but only one primer pair per contig detected polymorphisms. therefore, of the ten primer pairs that detected polymorphism, no two were from sequences in the same contig. these findings support the decision to test primer pairs that may amplify the same region in order to try to ensure that at least one primer pair will be useful in mapping.

the ten primer pairs amplified up to six products per genotype. the expected number of alleles per locus in a tetras genome is four, so in comparing two tetraploid genotypes with ssr primer pairs, a maximum of eight polymorphic products might be possible. even more may be possible for loci involving genes that are duplicated in tandem repeats or loose clusters  <cit> . the observed number of amplification products may be lower than the expected number due to several factors, including identical product size from one or more loci and deletion of some loci as has been observed in selfed progeny of synthetic tetraploid plants  <cit> .

the number of primer pairs detecting polymorphisms,  <dig> of  <dig> or around 30% is lower than reviews reporting ranges of 80% to 90%  <cit> . most studies test new primer pairs on several different accessions of the same species, and higher levels of polymorphism would be expected, but the polymorphism rate between two individuals is far more valuable to our goal of determining usefulness of this library in genetic mapping. in addition, much of the polymorphism useful in genetic mapping is unseen in parental screens of tetrasomic blackberry. the ten primer pairs that detected polymorphisms amplified up to three polymorphic products each , with an average of  <dig>  polymorphisms per primer pair. when these primer pairs are used with a mapping population, the number may increase. if the locus  from which a monomorphic pcr product is amplified is present in both parents in either a singe dose  or a double dose , some of the resulting segregants will be lacking the locus , and some of these loci can be mapped with a software program such as tetraploidmap  <cit> . if there is no preferential pairing between homeologous pairs of chromosomes, segregants at a locus for which both parents have a single dose will segregate in a ratio of approximately 3: <dig>  segregants at a locus for which both parents have a double dose will segregate in a ratio of 35: <dig>  and segregants at a locus for which one parent has a single dose and the other a double dose will segregate in a ratio of 11: <dig>  even though the primer pairs amplify a product from both parents and therefore do not appear to detect a polymorphism. if the amplification products are mapped as dominant markers, it is recommended that products segregating in either 11: <dig> or 35: <dig> ratios are eliminated from the mapping data set due to difficulties in gaining information from recombination events, but that products segregating in a 3: <dig> ratio  should still be included  <cit> .

expectations of results from further sequencing
the fact that 69% of  <dig>  sequences obtained from this library are singletons  indicates that many additional new blackberry sequences could be obtained from continued analysis of this library of  <dig>  clones, even though libraries sequenced from the 5' end tend to have higher rates of insufficient overlap to form contigs, inflating the number of singletons somewhat  <cit> . the initial sample size is very small compared to the expected number of unique genes in any plant . plants with relatively certain gene estimates, such as arabidopsis thaliana  hehnh, have many more genes, and a non-normalized library can be expected to have sequence similarities to numerous genes other than the ones found in this original small sampling. it's likely that, as more sequences are obtained from the library, a greater percentage will be assembled into contigs  <cit> . comparison of percentage singletons among other rosaceous crops is consistent with this assumption. the percentage singletons observed in a strawberry est library of  <dig>  sequences was 65%  <cit> , somewhat similar to what was observed in the blackberry est library. yet 35% of  <dig>  peach  batsch.) ests were singletons  <cit> , while only 17% percent of  <dig>  apple ests were singletons  <cit> .

assembly into contigs appears to help with the ability to find sequence similarity with other genes, as almost 13% of the  <dig>  high quality sequences were not found to be similar to other genes in genbank, while only around 4% of the  <dig> contigs formed from the  <dig>  sequences had no significant similarity to other sequences in genbank. contigs made up of multiple ests have longer consensus sequences and fewer errors. this increase in both length and quality increases the probability of identifying a statistically similar protein sequence. also, more heavily expressed genes will tend to form contigs in small samples, and higher expression makes them more likely to have been previously identified and present in databases.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this paper represents the first published analysis of ests from cultivated blackberry. the sequences and annotation are available via genbank and the genome database for rosaceae  <cit> . the resulting sequences were used to develop ssr markers for eventual use in genetic mapping. a subset of  <dig> ssr primer pairs was predictive that the total identified  <dig> ssr primer pairs would detect polymorphisms at a rate of 30%, resulting in  <dig> ssrs detecting polymorphisms, and that these would detects an average of  <dig>  polymorphisms per primer pair, or around  <dig> polymorphisms . although this number may be sufficient for identifying at least one ssr marker linked to primocane fruiting, it is unlikely to be sufficient to generate an adequate map of tetraploid blackberry. if our subset of  <dig>   <dig> clones sequenced is representative of the entire  <dig>  clones picked, then we can expect  <dig> ssr primer pairs  from this library to detect  <dig>  polymorphisms. the actual number of primer pairs that will detect polymorphisms will be lower due to redundancy which is expected to increase as more of the library is sequenced. on the other hand, the actual number of loci that can be mapped will be greater than the estimate because some of the ssr primer pairs are detecting loci present in single or double dose in both parents. the result should be a number of segregating loci sufficient to generate a fairly well saturated map that can be used by others to more efficiently identify ssr markers associated with other horticulturally important traits in other populations.

expectations are based on results from this study of the percentage of high quality sequences obtained, the percentage of those sequences which contained ssrs, the percentage of primer pairs selected to test, the percentage of ssrs that detected polymorphisms, and the average number of polymorphic products generated from each.
