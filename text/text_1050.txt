BACKGROUND
colorectal cancer  is considered to develop as a result of a multi-step progression and accumulation of genetic alterations  <cit> . gene expression profiling using microarrays has been used extensively in attempts to identify the genetic events associated with this progression. for colon cancer, expression profiling can readily discriminate between tumor and normal tissue as well as distinguish between tumors of different histopathological stage and prognosis to some extent  <cit> . it is anticipated that the identification of these gene expression differences may lead to a better understanding of neoplasia, help identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets. as with any microarray study, however, tissue heterogeneity is a confounding factor. previous studies on crc have often used "adjacent normal colon" as a control cell type. however, this tissue usually represents a mixture of cell types which do not accurately represent the epithelial cell lining of the luminal surface of the colon that gives rise to crc. clearly, a comprehensive and representative gene expression profile exclusively from normal colon epithelial cells would be a great benefit for comparison with tumor cells, especially since these cells are not readily cultured.

here we report a reliable expression reference data set for non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cells. these cells were derived from fresh, unfixed, clinically excised non-tumor related colectomy specimens and enriched using magnetic beads coated with a colon cell specific antibody. rna from these preparations was used to probe affymetrix genechip® exon  <dig>  st arrays. these arrays not only report gene expression levels but can also identify differential splicing events.

the findings from this study represent the first comprehensive expression profile for non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cells. we have compared the data derived from these colonic epithelial cells to a publically available set of tumor and normal matched colon data that had been hybridized to the same arrays. the dataset is available from affymetrix.com http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/exon_array_data.affx. this analysis allowed an assessment of global gene expression alterations in the tumors and demonstrated that adjacent normal tissues are not always the optimal control.

alternative splicing  is the process by which the exons of primary transcripts  can be spliced in different arrangements to produce structurally and functionally distinct mrna and protein variants. alternative splicing leads to massive diversity by generating multiple different mrnas from a single template. current estimates indicate that up to 95% of genes in the human genome exhibit alternative splicing  <cit> . furthermore, alternative splicing has increasingly been acknowledged as critical during normal development. previous studies of alternative gene splicing have, for the most part, focused on the identification and characterization of the control of splice site selection on a gene-by-gene basis. while these studies have provided extensive information about the factors and interactions that control formation of the spliceosome, relatively little is known about the global regulatory properties of alternative splicing  <cit> .

in this analysis, we also compared as events in tumors and the enriched normal colon epithelial cells. this analysis of splice variants on a genome-wide scale, however, is very labor intensive, and requires careful supervised examination of the data. it is anticipated that the contribution of this set of data derived from pure colonic epithelial cells will facilitate future studies in colon-related disease and offer a unique baseline for studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of alternative splicing.

RESULTS
one of the main objectives of this study was to generate a reference gene expression data set for normal colonic epithelium which can be used in comparisons with tumor samples. non-adenomatous and non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cells were procured from  <dig> different colectomy specimens with the clinical indication for each case being diverticular disease. of the  <dig> patients,  <dig> were female and  <dig> male, with the ages ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . the surgeries were performed by  <dig> different surgeons with four of the specimens excised by hand assisted laparoscopy and the other  <dig> performed by the conventional open surgical approach. the procurement protocol was designed to effectively enrich for the selected colonic cell population in the shortest time possible to control for variables that may influence the quality and integrity of clinical biospecimens, as described in the materials and methods section. the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse19163

gene expression
twelve samples of isolated colonic epithelial cells from  <dig> different patients  were analyzed using the exon  <dig>  st arrays. these data were then compared with a publically available data set http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/exon_array_data.affx,  <cit>  which provided raw exon <dig>  st data for ten colon tumors and matched 'normal 'tissues from the same patients. total rna from these samples were purchased from biochain institute inc. all of the raw data was imported into partek and the arrays normalized using quantile normalization followed by probeset summarization using rma. pca analysis for these data sets is shown in figure 1a, where it is evident that the normal and tumor tissues from the public data set clustered together, while the cell samples obtained from our enrichment procedure separated distinctly from the two other tissue sources. a 3-way anova identified that a major source of variance was due to the sample processing differences between the  <dig> laboratories, referred to as "scan date" . patient "sex" was also noted as a major source of variance which was primarily due to the fact that the tumor/normal colon data set consisted of  <dig> males and  <dig> females, while our analysis used samples from  <dig> females and  <dig> males which slightly skewed the analysis for this category. to correct for these batch effects, therefore, we removed two of these sources of variance and reanalyzed the data where it is clear that the  <dig> types of tissues now cluster more closely  although the cells still form a discrete cluster while the tumor and normal tissues cluster together in no defined pattern. figure 1d displays the anova histogram showing that the variation attributable to scan date and sex have been removed.

following this corrective processing, the various cut-off values for expression differences were set at p =  <dig>  for the experimental sets compared to normal and combined with fold change values of  <dig>  genes showing differential expression using these analysis parameters are shown in the venn diagram in figure  <dig>  this analysis reveals that there are more changes in the comparison between the isolated epithelial cells and the tumor than there were in the comparison between the matched tumor and normal tissue. genes showing the highest increased expression levels in the tumor vs cell comparison were olfm <dig>  fn <dig>  actg <dig>  igj, acta <dig>  col1a <dig>  sparc, rcn <dig>  col3a <dig> and col1a <dig>  the genes with the most significant decreases included tmigd <dig>  otop <dig>  ca <dig>  zg <dig>  ms4a <dig>  guca2b, best <dig>  cd <dig>  hrasls <dig>  ifit <dig> and muc <dig> 

the data was then analyzed using ingenuity pathways analysis . one of the top canonical pathways associated with the deg list generated from the comparison of tumor to cells was the wnt signaling pathway. fifty eight genes from our analysis of tumor compared to cells were deregulated in this pathway consisting of  <dig> members in total  and has  <dig> molecules fitting into the network. it is apparent from the network ideogram that all molecules interact either directly or indirectly through the cdkn1a gene.

the most significant biological function associated with disease and disorder category was cancer with  <dig> of the molecules in the comparison of tumors to epithelial cells fitting into this category with an associated p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the most significantly altered subcategories within this functional category included; tumorigenesis , neoplasia , cancer  colorectal cancer 

the most significant  molecular and cellular function was cell growth and proliferation, a category which describes functions associated with cell growth including colony formation proliferation and outgrowth of cells. six hundred and thirty nine of the genes from the deg fit into this cellular function category. the most significant  physiological function was tissue development with  <dig> genes from the deg list fitting into this functional category. this category includes functions associated with development and differentiation and the formation of tissues through the association of cells including growth, patterning and survival of tissues, accumulation, adhesion and clustering of cells.

the comparison of tumor to normal tissue showed fewer gene expression differences with much lower fold changes. the highest increases in gene expression included, lgr <dig>  cst <dig>  spp <dig>  cldn <dig>  mmp <dig>  inhba, thbs <dig> sfrp <dig>  etv <dig> and slc6a <dig>  the most significantly down-regulated genes included slc26a <dig>  guca2a, zg <dig>  clca <dig>  myh <dig>  aqp <dig>  tmigd <dig>  ca <dig>  clca <dig>  anpep and adh1c.

the most significant  canonical pathway associated with the deg list generated from the comparison of tumor to normal tissue was the hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation pathway. interestingly, this was also one of the top  <dig> pathways found associated with the tumor vs cell comparison. eleven genes of a possible  <dig> genes in this canonical pathway were altered in the comparison between tumor and normal tissues. this most significant network generated from this comparison was cancer, cell movement, hematological system development and function. the score for this network was  <dig>  and is shown is shown in additional file  <dig>  it is apparent from the network ideogram that all molecules interact either directly or indirectly through the tnf or il1b genes, although these genes themselves do not show altered expression in the tumors compared to normal tissues.

the most significant biological function associated with disease and disorder category was cancer and  <dig> of the molecules in the comparison of tumors to cells fit into this category with an associated p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the most significant  molecular and cellular function was cellular movement,  <dig> of the genes from the deg fit into this cellular function category. the most significant  physiological function was tissue morphology with  <dig> genes from the deg list fitting into this functional category. this category includes functions associated with development and differentiation and the formation of tissues through the association of cells including growth, patterning and survival of tissues, accumulation, adhesion and clustering of cells.

thus, from this analysis, it is clear that the altered gene expression profiles depend on the origin of the normal sample. despite the variation in the analysis between the tumor and different normal samples,  <dig> genes showed the same changes regardless of the normal sample used . this analysis strategy demonstrates an important application of this data because it verifies the gene expression changes that occur in both isolated cells and hetergenous normal tissue, while omitting the transcript alterations that are attributable to tissue heterogeneity alone. the genes showing the highest expression changes in tumor compared to both normal tissues and cells were cldn <dig>  cst <dig>  kiaa <dig>  mmp <dig>  rfc <dig>  mthrd <dig>  znf <dig>  mmp <dig>  inhba and psat <dig>  genes showing the largest decreases in expression included; guca2a, kpna <dig>  slc26a <dig>  plac <dig>  anpep, slc26a <dig>  fabp <dig>  dhrs <dig>  slc4a <dig> and tspan <dig> 

ipa analysis of the data showed that the canonical pathway with the highest number of members from this list of  <dig> overlapping genes was the bladder cancer signaling pathway with a significance value of p =  <dig> e- <dig>  only  <dig> members of the  <dig> were deregulated in a pathway consisting of  <dig> molecules. the wnt signaling pathway was also in the top  <dig> canonical pathways with a p value of  <dig> e- <dig>  the lower p values in this comparison is expected because the list of genes is very limited.

the top network generated from this deg list is cancer, cell growth and proliferation, cellular movement and is shown in additional file  <dig>  this pathway has an associated score of  <dig> . the majority of the genes showing down-regulation interact with il <dig>  tnf and tgfb <dig>  while genes showing increased expression show direct interactions with hnf1a.

the biological functional analysis showed that the most significant  disease and disorder category generated by this list of  <dig> overlapping genes was cancer. it is noteworthy this was also the most significant generated by tumor vs cell comparison. the most significant  molecular function was cell death, a functional category associated with cytolysis, necrosis, survival and recovery of cells. twenty one genes from the list of  <dig> fit into this category, of which  <dig> demonstrated up-regulation. the most significant  physiological function identified was tissue development with  <dig> molecules fitting in this functional category. four of these were involved in the accumulation of cells and were all up-regulated in the tumors. an additional  <dig> up-regulated genes were associated with formation of the endothelial tube and an additional  <dig>  were associated with cell adhesion.

exon-level analysis
since the st arrays not only report gene expression levels but also splicing differences, we reanalyzed the data to identify splice variants between the various samples. a major complication in the analysis of the as data, however, comes from the differential detection of transcription and mrna processing. if the hybridization intensities for the individual probesets are examined, and these differences are used as an index of splicing, incorrect conclusions will be drawn because the intensities are not considered within the context of the entire transcript. as shown in figure 3a, the average intensities for the probesets representing the exons of the gem gene show a high p-value  for alternative splicing in a comparison between the tumors and cells, but the entire transcript has an overall increased expression in the tumors compared to the cells . to overcome this complication, we devised a more strict way of detecting as, which was designed to decrease the false positive rate, although it may also have eliminated some possible as events. we also limited our analysis to a comparison between the tumors and isolated epithelial cells . the exon-specific probesets required p values for alternative splicing of < <dig> , the p value for whole transcript expression was > <dig>  and the fold change cut off for whole transcript expression had to be < <dig>  and >- <dig> . in this way we eliminated whole transcript expression while detecting exon-specific changes and defined  <dig> genes showing alternative splicing. each of these genes was then examined visually using partek genomics suite gene view. the full data set is available in additonal file  <dig> 

to evaluate the utility of our approach, we selected a subset of genes that were known to be alternatively spliced as recorded in the ucsc genome browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/. upon visual examination many of the genes included in our analysis failed to display convincing as events in genes known to be alternatively spliced, highlighting the need for more careful examination of the data. however, we found a number of genes that displayed convincing alterative splicing in genes with known as. table  <dig> describes the genes that we have selected. a few examples of these are shown in figures 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e and 3f. the average intensities of the probe sets representing the osbpl1a gene are shown in figure 3b. the tumor tissue expresses the full length isoform b while the cells express the truncated isoform a version. another example is shown in figure 3c which displays the average intensities for the probesets representing the exons of the prkcsh gene. the tumors express isoform  <dig> of this gene, while the colon epithelial cells typify isoform  <dig>  figure 3d shows that the overall expression level for pycard is higher in the tumor tissue which expresses the α-isoform of this gene, while the cells clearly express the β isoform. figure 3e shows the intensity plot for phf <dig> where the tumor expresses the truncated 3' exon and the cells express the full length exon. this gene has over  <dig> different alternative splice variants recorded. an example of alterative 5' exon expression is shown in figure 3f in the dalrd <dig> gene.

the genes were selected by limiting the p-values for alternative splicing to <. <dig>  to eliminate genes that had whole transcript level differences the p value for gene expression was set at p >  <dig>  and a fold change of < <dig>  or >- <dig> . the individual probesets for the genes were then visually examined and those with corresponding reports of alternative splicing events in refseq were included in the analysis.

of the  <dig> genes apparently showing alternative splicing, approximately 60% showed as events involving exons that had not been reported in refseq. these data demonstrate the incompleteness of our current understanding of the extent of as. for example,  in refseq there is only one representative transcript for the flot <dig> gene with no alternative splicing. the h-invdb , released in december  <dig> http://www.h-invitational.jp/hinv/ahg-db/index.jsp however, describes  <dig> variants of flot <dig> . interestingly, none of these variants have the same profile of the patterns shown in figure 4a, where the tumor appears to have no expression of 5th and 6th exons from the 3' end of the gene. there are  <dig> transcripts that are missing those exons but none that have retained the 5' exon. since this gene shows high expression levels, it is possible that the 5' probes could exceed the saturation threshold and therefore the array is not capable of discriminating a loss at the 5' end.

in the same way, the nes gene  apparently shows differential expression of  <dig> probe sets in the last 3' exon and, while refseq reports a single variant of this gene, h-invdb reports  <dig> variants. the refseq variant is shown in figure 4b insert in blue. the region on the 3' exon that shows higher expression in the tumors corresponds to the first and last transcripts reported by h-invdb.

another interesting example is shown in figure 4c where exons  <dig>   <dig> and part of  <dig> of the c14orf <dig> gene appear to be differentially spliced between the two tissue types. refseq details a single transcript for this gene, while h-inv reports  <dig> alternatively spliced variants. there are currently no known variants that would explain the differences in the profiles for the two tissues. figure 4c shows  <dig> transcripts reported in h-inv for the c20orf <dig> gene, none of which correspond to the probeset which shows differential splicing between the colon epithelial cells and the tumor tissues. the circled transcript closely approximates what is seen on the array but the actual probeset maps within an expressed sequence.

in many cases, the probesets would have alternative splicing events in exons or introns that were not known to be alternatively spliced, although other regions of the genes were reported in refseq as as events. these examples further highlight the complexity of as. figure 5a shows the average intensities for the probesets representing the exons of the cecr <dig> gene. the expression intensities for the last  <dig> exons are very similar but values for exons  <dig> and  <dig> show higher values for the tumor. exon  <dig> shows similar intensities between the two tissues and they diverge at the 5' exon where the cells show an alternative 5' isoform which has been reported in refseq. the h-invdb reports  <dig> alternative splicing events . the arrow shows the most likely transcript  whereby the tumors have retained exons  <dig> and  <dig> but the 5' exon is missing. the cells appear to be expressing the hit <dig> transcript that is missing exons  <dig> and  <dig> but has retained exons  <dig> and  <dig>  one caveat with this scenario is that this transcript also does not express exon  <dig>  there are differences between the expression of these two exons between the two tissue types whereby the tumor has a mean relative intensity of  <dig>  and the cells have a mean intensity of  <dig>  indicating that this is the transcript expressed by the cells or there is another variant of this transcript not yet reported.

clearly, the data obtained from exon array analysis is very complex and requires in depth analysis of putative as events. the availability of this data set which serves as a normal control in the analysis of colon diseases, will potentially help improve our understanding of the complex phenomenon of as.

discussion
one of the challenges in whole transcript profiling has been to use the appropriate cell type in comparisons of tumor to normal cells. in this study, we present a dataset that we feel can serve as a normal control in the analysis of abnormal colon epithelium at the level of gene expression, and as a reference for as profiles using the affymetrix exon <dig>  st arrays. the recent availability of arrays that allow the detection of as events on a genome-wide scale, suggest that detection of gene expression at the transcript level alone may completely overlook gene expression changes at the level of splicing that are germane to the disease state.

the advantage of this particular data set stems from the fact that the profiles are derived exclusively from normal epithelial cells of the colon with no stromal contaminants. in colorectal cancer a gradual progression and accumulation of genetic alterations from the "normal"/non-neoplastic state to malignancy has been described. to date, it has not been possible to progressively propagate normal enterocytes in cell culture, making gene expression studies difficult  <cit> . caco- <dig> cells have been used as normal controls for many studies, based on their "normal" appearance. the similarity to normal epithelial cells stems from phenotypic similarities to in situ enterocytes based on the acquisition of structural and functional polarity  <cit>  but it has since been shown that expression characteristics similar to colon cancer have been observed in these cells  <cit> . mucosa from fresh tissue specimens has also been used as a substitute for normal colonic epithelial cells  <cit> , although microscopic examination of these samples clearly demonstrates that they represent a heterogeneous collection of cells with varying proportions of lympocytes scattered from the proximal to distal end of the colon. clearly, these cells will compromise the analysis because of the contribution of the stromal components. in the latter, there is a preponderance of fibroblasts, the cells involved in the host's "desmoplastic" response to the invading tumor.

the approach described here has been previously proven to enrich for viable, unfixed colonic enterocytes and profiled them using the affymetrix genechip exon st  <dig>  array. we used the publicly available colon paired tumor/normal set to demonstrate the utility of this data. analysis at the transcript level allowed a confirmation of genes that were differentially expressed between the tumor and normal tissues. this approach to the analysis of expression data may be an important application for this data set, as it verifies the gene expression changes in tissues while omitting those transcript alterations that are attributable to tissue heterogeneity. of the  <dig> genes that showed expression alterations between the tumors compared to normal tissues and confirmed in the enterocytes, the most significant network identified was cancer, cell growth and proliferation and cellular movement. the majority of genes show interaction with tnf or tgfβ <dig> or both. interestingly, both have been reported to be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  which characterizes the progression of many carcinomas, including colon cancer. bates and mercurio  <cit>  demonstrated that tgfβ1-induced emt is accelerated dramatically by the presence of activated macrophages, identified tnf as the critical factor produced by macrophages that accelerates the emt in a model of colon cancer.

the exon  <dig>  st array does not detect actual transcripts but the expression levels of individual exons, which are then reconstructed into transcripts virtually. the analysis does not provide information about which exons are co-expressed and in which orientation, but instead assembles genes based on the association of exons with that particular locus . the common assumption is that expression levels derived from these whole-transcript arrays are more accurate predictors of expression. this is due to the fact that 3' arrays will typically miscall gene expression alterations in those genes that have alternative 3' splicing.

it is perhaps important to appreciate the advantages of using the affymetrix genechip exon st  <dig>  arrays and their ability to define as. as introduces several levels of complexity into the analysis of gene expression alterations, however, several key features have been identified. as in a given gene is not an all-or-nothing event, and is usually a subtle shift in the actual levels of individual exon expression. furthermore, error is introduced with variation in amplification efficiency across individual transcripts. bemmo et al  <cit>  suggest that the high gc content of 5' end, and reduced priming efficiency in the 3' end due to an artifact of random priming results in different signal intensities at the ends of genes and so increases the number of false positives. this can be further compounded by tissue heterogeneity and the fact that splicing patterns can be inherited  <cit> . hybridization efficiency is also affected by the presence of snp within the sequence of the probeset  <cit> . as has also been found to differ as a function of ethnicity  <cit> . one commonly used approach to the analysis of exon array data is to use the splicing index, where the probeset intensity is divided by the entire transcript intensity . this approach suffers from some methodological and statistical drawbacks resulting in high false positive rates . we used a very strict tactic for the detection of as, to decrease the false positive rate but this approach may also eliminate possible as events. the use of anova, where the interaction between the sample type and probeset is used to indicate differential expression of probesets within the framework of whole transcripts, allows the removal of variables and permits a calculation of significance of as in the absence of large fold changes at the transcript level. one caveat with this approach is that it assumes an unvarying response of each probeset within a transcript and this assumption is not met for probesets that are saturated or that hybridize weakly  <cit> . using our stringent criteria for analysis we obtained a list of  <dig> presumed as genes, although, upon visual examination of these genes, very few  actually exhibited convincing alternative splicing in genes with variants recorded in refseq, highlighting the need for careful examination of the data produced by such analyses. most of the as changes occurred in genes not reported to be alternatively spliced in refseq, and often not reported in more highly curated databases such as h-invdb. due to the large amount of est and genomic information, a vast amount of information can be obtained from in-silico prediction of transcript isoforms but many of the available est libraries are cloned from tumor samples and as such the databases tend to lack information on normal splice forms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
use of the affymetrix genechip exon st  <dig>  and gene st  <dig>  arrays will provide an equitable and empirical platform to access information on transcript variants. this data set is a valuable asset for studies of colon disease. we have demonstrated that, using normalization across array and removal of variation attributed to technical processing, the data can be compared to tumors and normal tissue processed at a different time and place assuring that the data is transportable. the raw data is available at geo.
