BACKGROUND
corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is a minuscule, gram-positive, pleomorphic, non-sporulating facultative anaerobic bacillus. belonging to the genus corynebacteriaceae , which includes the genera rhodococcus and mycobacterium, it is known to be a causative agent of caseous lymphadenitis  in small ruminants, such as goats and sheep  <cit> .

cl is a chronic infectious disease characterized by the formation of granulomas. infection primarily involves the skin and affected mucosa, followed by the spread of either free bacteria or those inside phagocytes, leading to localized infection in the lymph nodes or internal organs  <cit> .

once successfully established within the host, chronic infection may persist throughout most, or even the entire lifespan of the animal  <cit> . this disorder compromises the animal’s skin, skeleton and internal organs, in addition to reducing wool production, limiting weight gain and reproductive efficiency, resulting in reduced birth rates of offspring  <cit>  and severe economic hardship for livestock producers, especially small farmers.

the adaptive resistance to infection caused by facultative intracellular bacteria, such as c. pseudotuberculosis, is related to cd <dig> t cells and, more specifically, to clones that produce th1-type cytokines, mainly ifn-γ and tnf-α. these pro-inflammatory cytokines increase the bactericidal activity of macrophages and activate cd <dig> t lymphocytes  <cit> .

one of the main characteristics of pathogenic mycobacteria is its capability to tolerate and manipulate host immune response, thereby promoting intracellular pathogen survival  <cit> . initial interactions between macrophages and mycobacteria result in the activation of the intracellular signaling pathway, whereby events mediated by receptors are associated with transcriptional responses and protein translation  <cit> .

the mitogen-activated protein kinases  are a subfamily of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. mapks are expressed by all cell types and respond to extracellular stimuli  that mediate signal transduction from cell surface receptors to nuclei  <cit> . mapks, part of a phosphorylation system in which three kinases are sequentially activated  <cit> , are expressed in mammalian cells and translate signals in response to growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and stress conditions.

three subfamilies of mapks have been well-characterized: mapk p <dig>  which contains four isoforms ; erk, the kinase regulated by extracellular signaling, with isoforms p <dig>  and p <dig> ; and the protein kinase c-jun n-terminal, with isoforms, jnk  <dig>  jnk  <dig> and jnk  <dig>  <cit> .

mapk p <dig> regulates the expression of several cytokines, is activated in immune cells by inflammatory cytokines, and plays an important role in the activation of host immune response  <cit> . erk  <dig> and  <dig> are widely expressed and involved in the regulation of meiosis, mitosis and post-mitotic functions in a variety of cells. cytokines are among the many different stimuli capable of activating the erk  <dig> and erk  <dig> pathways  <cit> . in addition, mapk p <dig> shares about 50% of its homology with erk  <cit> , suggesting that these two pathways may play similar roles during host immune response.

the present study employed cba mouse splenocytes to evaluate the potential involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinases mapk p <dig> and erk <dig> and  <dig> with respect to selected in vitro cytokine production under stimulation by antigens secreted/excreted by c. pseudotuberculosis.

RESULTS
action of mitogen-activated protein kinase specific inhibitors on the production of tnf-α under stimulation by c. pseudotuberculosis antigens
an analysis of the group of cba mice infected with the virulent vd <dig> strain of c. pseudotuberculosis for 30 days revealed a statistically significant inhibition  of tnf-α production. this was induced only by the mapk p <dig>  and erk 1/ <dig>  inhibitors under stimulation by both virulent and attenuated secreted/excreted antigens. however, also at 30 days after infection, cells obtained from the group of animals infected with the attenuated t <dig> strain showed no statistically significant inhibition in tnf-α production following treatment with mapk inhibitors under stimulation by secreted antigens .figure  <dig>

the data presented herein strongly suggest that, under the experimental protocol described above, the main pathways involved in the production of tnf-α are mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig>  in addition, the present study also demonstrated the involvement of the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> and  <dig> pathways with respect to the production of il- <dig>  recent studies have suggested that the mapk signaling pathway is essential to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . the activation of the mapks pathway varies in terms frequency and extent in accordance with pathogen species and degree of virulence  <cit> .

after infection for 30 days with the virulent vd <dig> strain, the data herein suggest that the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> pathways are involved in the production of tnf-α when stimulated by secreted/excreted antigens. by contrast, none of the mapks pathways appeared to be involved in tnf-α production after 30 days of infection by the attenuated t <dig> strain. nonetheless, after 60 days of infection under stimulation by the set <dig> antigen, all three analyzed mapk pathways demonstrated involvement in tnf-α production. furthermore, in cell cultures stimulated with the sevd <dig> antigen for 60 days, the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> pathways demonstrated involvement in cytokine production, while the erk  <dig> pathway did not.

a previous study conducted by sim et al.  <cit>  found that in vitro infection by m. avium in the monocytes of healthy patients was able to successfully activate the mapk p <dig> and erk 1/ <dig> pathways and positively regulate tnf-α production. however, this same study also employed monocytes from diseased patients with m. abscessus and found that in vitro infection with m. avium decreased the expression of mapk p <dig> and erk 1/ <dig>  in addition to reducing tnf-α production.

basler et al.  <cit>  investigated the production of tnf-α by murine macrophages infected with m. avium subspecies paratuberculosis  and m. smegmatis  using mapk p <dig>  inhibitors. these authors found that the mapk p <dig> pathway was indeed involved in tnf-α production, with low levels observed under infection by the pathogenic species. according to their findings, the induced decrease in tnf-α by pathogenic mycobacteria was associated with a reduction in the duration and extent of mapk p <dig> phosphorylation.

other studies have demonstrated the importance of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α, most notably at the site of infection  <cit> . as such, the blocking of tnf-α by monoclonal antibodies inhibits the formation of well-differentiated granulomas in experimental infection models employing m. tuberculosis, resulting in the dissemination of the pathogen  <cit> .

according to rocco and irane  <cit> , the interference of intracellular signaling is fundamental to the strategy of virulence of intracellular pathogens, such as m. tuberculosis and m. avium.

the aforementioned study by sim et al.  <cit>  reported on the importance of the activation of the mapk p <dig> and erk 1/ <dig> pathways with respect to tnf-α production. these authors demonstrated that the insufficient activation of the mapk p <dig> pathway in response to pathogenic mycobacteria may represent an important mechanism, due to the negative regulation of host immune response, thus allowing the pathogen to persist intracellularly.

with respect to the involvement of the three evaluated mapk pathways in the production of il- <dig>  the findings presented herein are in partial agreement with the data presented by méndez-samperio et al.  <cit> . theses authors treated human lung epithelial cells with the sb <dig> mapk p <dig> inhibitor, demonstrating the involvement of mapk p <dig> signaling in the secretion of il- <dig> following infection with m. bovis bcg cells. however, this same study also used pd <dig> to inhibit the mek  pathway and found that this pathway was not involved in il- <dig> production, which is known to be responsible for the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of erk.

according to souza et al.  <cit> , blocking the mapk p <dig> pathway with sb <dig> prior to infecting bovine monocytes with m. avium subspecies paratuberculosis resulted in decreased il- <dig> expression. elevated il- <dig> expression was also observed along with increased acidification of phagocytes and a reinforcement of parasite killing, suggesting that the overproduction of il- <dig> mediated by the mapk p <dig> pathway may play an important role in the mitigation of antimicrobial activity by phagocytes. this association constitutes a key mechanism involved in the capability of m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis to survive in bovine monocytes.

il- <dig> is known to inhibit the transcription and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α and il- <dig>  as well as to impede antigen presentation and inhibit the proliferation of t cells that produce ifn-γ  <cit> ; as such, this cytokine clearly suppresses the th <dig> response.

taken together, the findings presented in previous studies indicate that the early activation of the mapk p <dig> pathway may be a common mechanism by which virulent mycobacterial organisms suppress the antimicrobial response of susceptible host cells, allowing pathogens to persist intracellularly.

the activation of the mapk p <dig> signaling pathway leads to rapid il- <dig> expression under infection by intracellular bacteria, which in turn attenuates antimycobacterial activity, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines and phagosome maturation. thus, it is possible that further manipulation of the mapk p <dig> pathway may lead to a better understanding of the escape mechanisms used by c. pseudotuberculosis to evade host immune response during infection.

the data presented herein suggest that none of the mapk pathways studied were involved in the production of ifn-γ. this finding is unsurprising, as the literature contains various studies showing the involvement of mapk p <dig> and erk 1/ <dig> in the production of pro-inflammatory and/or regulatory cytokines in experimental models that employ a variety of intracellular parasites  <cit> .

il- <dig> production was observed to involve only the erk  <dig> pathway in cba mice after 60 days of infection with the virulent strain under stimulation by the set <dig> antigen. this finding suggests the differential involvement of a cascade of cellular signaling in response to virulent and attenuated c. pseudotuberculosis at various infection times. these differences in pathway activation may result from the differential expression of molecular compounds by the two strains considered herein, which are then recognized by macrophage receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study serves to contribute to the working body of knowledge on the interaction of c. psedotuberculosis and immune resonse of the host, as it clearly demonstrates the importance of the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> pathways with respect to tnf-α production, as well as the mapk p <dig> and erk  <dig> and  <dig> pathways in relation to il- <dig> production under infection by c. pseudotuberculosis, providing evidence that the respective signaling pathways are important regulators of cellular response to this pathogen.

additionally, the lack of involvement of the mapk p <dig> and erk 1/ <dig> pathways in ifn-γ production in infected cba murine cells stimulated with the two secreted/excreted antigens, considered in conjunction with the production of il- <dig> showing involvement only via the erk  <dig> pathway under stimulation by set <dig> antigen during 60-day infection period with the virulent strain, suggests that these signaling pathways may cooperate to regulate the production of only pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines in the splenic cells of cba mice. further studies should be conducted to validate this hypothetical assumption.
