BACKGROUND
dna microarray can simultaneously measure the expression levels of thousands of genes. increasingly, the challenge is to interpret such data to reveal molecular biological processes and the mechanism of human diseases. one of the main goals of expression data analysis is to identify the changing and unchanging genes and to correlate these changes with similar expression profiles. one of the major challenges for gene expression analysis is the reduction of dimension. gene expression data typically have high dimensionality, with tens of thousands of genes whereas the number of observations or experiments is usually under a hundred. because the number of variables easily exceeds that of experiments, dimension reduction is obviously required for gene expression analysis. this task can be considered as a matrix factorization problem.

matrix factorization  methods on microarray data can extract distinct patterns from the data  <cit> . principal component analysis  and singular value decomposition  are popular analysis methods, and they have been applied to classification problems with satisfactory results  <cit> . however, because of the holistic nature of pca or svd, it is difficult to provide the biologically instinctive interpretation of data from the obtained components. in order to overcome this limitation, paatero and tapper  <cit>  and lee and seung  <cit>  proposed that non-negative matrix factorization  can learn part-based representations that can provide the obvious interpretation. the non-negativity constraints make the representation purely additive , in comparison with many other linear representations such as pca and independent component analysis   <cit> . their work was applied to signal processing and text mining. brunet et al.  <cit>  applied nmf to describe the gene expression profiles of all genes in terms of a few number of metagenes in order to derive meaningful biological information from cancer expression datasets. they clustered the samples into distinct subtypes by metagene expression patterns.

the gene expression patterns can be sparsely encoded by metagenes, implying a few significantly co-expressed genes. several groups have proposed nmf formulation that enforces the sparseness of the decomposition. li et al.  <cit>  proposed local nmf  that has additional constraints to enforce the sparseness in the nmf. hoyer  <cit>  also proposed nmf formulation that can find parts-based representations by explicitly incorporating the concept of sparseness. wang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated fisher non-negative matrix factorization  that learns localized features by imposing fisher constraints. gao and church  <cit>  attempted to control sparseness by penalizing the number of non-zero entries unlike other methods.

sample-based clustering, however, is not the only concern in microarray data analysis. gene-based clustering provides informative sets of tightly co-regulated genes. while sample-based clustering relies on metagenes, gene-based clustering relies on meta-samples. the two processes can be viewed as bi-directionally constrained with each other. good metagene may support good sample-based clusters and vice versa. optimizing sample- dimension only, sparseness of gene-dimension is relatively decreased when sparseness of sample-dimension is increased. in result, the minimization problem is convex that was subsequently described by others  <cit>  and resulting matrix cannot support gene-based clusters well. therefore, optimizing both sample and gene dimension together may be appropriated for clustering of microarray data. here, we employed a novel non-orthogonal mf algorithm, bi-directional non-negative matrix factorization , with bi-directional sparseness constraints superimposed on non-negative constraints, comprising a few dominantly co-expressed genes and samples together. the bi-directional optimization process may provide quality clustering with improved biological relevance that may not be achieved by applying mfs for each dimension separately.

many clustering-based methods are developed to transform a large matrix of gene expression levels into a more informative set of which genes are highly possible to share biological properties. although clustering-based algorithms for microarray data analysis have been extensively studies, most works have not focused on the systematic comparison and validation of clustering results.

different algorithms tend to lead to different clustering solutions on the same data, while the same algorithm often leads to different results for different parameter settings. since there is no consensus on choosing among them, the applicable measures should be applied for assessing the quality of a clustering solution in different situations. for example, when the true solution is known and we can compare it to another solution, minkowski measure  <cit>  or the jaccard coefficient  <cit>  is applicable. whereas, when the true solution is not known, there is no agreed-upon method for validating the quality of a suggested solution. several methods evaluate clustering solutions based on intra-cluster homogeneity or inter-cluster separation  <cit> . meanwhile, the prediction of the correct number of clusters is a basic problem in unsupervised classification problems. to solve this problem, a number of cluster validity indices, assessing the quality of a clustering partition have been proposed.

in the present paper, we would like to systematically evaluate various mfs applied to gene-expression data analysis. we compare six mfs, including two orthogonal mfs  and four non-orthogonal mfs  and bsnmf) and a well-known unsupervised clustering method, k-means algorithm. all were evaluated by seven cluster-evaluation indices. we evaluated them in view of basic three categories:  traditional clustering,  orthogonal mfs and  non-orthogonal mfs. predictive power and consistency of the methods are evaluated by using adjusted rand index and accuracy index when the class labels of data were available. to evaluate the biological relevance of the resulting clusters from different algorithms, we evaluated the significance of the biological enrichment for the clusters by using gene ontology  and biological pathway annotations.

RESULTS
evaluation of each clustering-based method
in our study, we applied k-means algorithm and six mfs, which are two orthogonal  and four non-orthogonal  algorithms to the five benchmarking datasets. we evaluated the seven methods using nine measures, including seven cluster evaluation indices and two prediction power measures. fig.  <dig> exhibits results from the seven cluster-quality measures. we repeatedly applied the clustering  algorithms  <dig> times for each dataset for each number of clusters, i.e. k =  <dig> to  <dig>  or  <dig> to  <dig> . the values in fig. <dig> represent the averages.

among measures, the gap statistic is optimized when it decreases ), while others are optimized when they increase  – ). the homogeneity, separation, dunn index, average silhouette width and hubert correlation  tend to be higher for non-orthogonal mfs than results from orthogonal mfs and k-means algorithm. the gap statistic is lower for non-orthogonal mfs than orthogonal mfs and k-means. but, pearson correlation of cophenetic distance has the highest value for svd ). overall, non-orthogonal mfs represented best clustering quality.

we compared homogeneity with separation at the same time . results from measures for each dataset were clustered. results from nmf, snmf and bsnmf showed higher slope, that is, their homogeneity and separation are more optimized than others. when we compare one of the measures, hubert correlation of cophenetic distance between mfs, at each number of clusters , nmf, snmf and bsnmf showed better performance than others in four datasets except for the leukemia dataset. ica has the highest value for the leukemia dataset. overall, non-negative mfs have best clustering quality.

the three datasets, leukemia, medulloblastoma and iris datasets have known class labels as ‘gold standards’. for the three datasets, we measured accuracy or predictive power using the adjusted rand index and prediction accuracy. fig.  <dig> shows the adjusted rand index for the correct classification for the three datasets with the seven methods . the leukemia dataset was evaluated at both two-class ) and three-class ) levels. fig.  <dig> demonstrates that bsnmf, snmf and nmf have the highest adjusted rand index for most of the evaluations.

fig.  <dig> shows the results from prediction accuracy. snmf and bsnmf tend to show the best accuracy measures. we also included a voting scheme that simply combines all the results from the various algorithms and returns the best consensus. voting showed comparable results to snmf and bsnmf.

detailed class prediction results for the leukemia dataset are shown in table  <dig>  class assignment is optimized for each dataset when accuracy has the highest value. all methods were tested both at k= <dig> and k= <dig>  at k= <dig> level, one aml sample  was incorrectly assigned to all by snmf and bsnmf. the result is the same as that of gao et al.  <cit> . the error count for nmf was two . overall, non-orthogonal mfs like bsnmf, snmf, nmf and ica showed higher prediction accuracy than orthogonal mfs and k-means algorithm. at k= <dig> level, bsnmf showed the best results with only one mistake that aml_ <dig> was incorrectly assigned to all, while snmf made two mistakes . table  <dig> shows the results for the medulloblastoma dataset k= <dig>  bsnmf showed the best result with  <dig> mistakes, while snmf and nmf have  <dig> and ica has  <dig>

evaluation of biological relevance
to evaluate the biological relevance of the clustering results, we created clusters of genes and assigned them to the corresponding sample-wise clusters. for mfs, we clustered genes by using coefficient matrix of genes. for instance, in the leukemia dataset factorized by nmf at k= <dig>  we clustered genes into two groups by using the coefficient matrix of genes, w, from nmf. given such a factorization, the matrix w is able to be used to determine the gene cluster membership, that is, a gene i is placed in a cluster j if the wij is the largest entry in row i. applying k-means algorithm, we clustered genes using original gene expression data matrix. then, we labelled gene-cluster corresponding to the labels of sample-cluster.

gene-wise clusters are annotated by go terms and biological pathways. we measured the significance of go term  assignment by using hyper-geometric distribution. here we briefly regard each go term and biological pathway as a term. table  <dig> shows the numbers of significantly enriched terms for the corresponding clusters at p <  <dig> . for the leukemia dataset, bsnmf  and nmf  have the highest numbers of significantly enriched terms in all. bsnmf has the highest numbers in aml  and in total  ). table  <dig> shows the results from medulloblastoma dataset. in cluster  <dig>  bsnmf  and k-means  have the most significantly enriched terms. in cluster  <dig>  svd  and nmf  have the most terms. the total number of significant terms is the biggest with bsnmf . table  <dig> demonstrates that the fibroblast dataset has the biggest total number of significant terms for bsnmf . table  <dig> exhibits the result from the mouse dataset. in cluster  <dig>  bsnmf  and snmf  have the most significantly enriched terms. in cluster  <dig>  ica  has the most terms. the total number of significant terms is the biggest with bsnmf . overall, the numbers of significantly enriched terms resulting from non-orthogonal mfs, bsnmf, snmf, nmf and ica, are bigger than those of orthogonal mfs and k-means algorithm.

number of significantly enriched terms at α= <dig> 

dueck et al.  <cit>  summarized go terms with significance to the resulting clusters from various clustering algorithms using two representations: the proportion of factors that are significantly enriched for at least one functional category at α= <dig>  and the mean log <dig> . we combined two representations. we calculated the weighted p-values, the proportion of significant go terms multiplies the negative log <dig> . fig.  <dig> shows the weighted p-values of the go terms significantly annotated to the corresponding clusters for the leukemia and medulloblastoma datasets. the weighted p-values are more significant when they have higher value. for simplicity, we plotted the top  <dig> terms. plots for other dataset can be found in the supplement web site . for the leukemia dataset, bsnmf and k-means were shown to have annotated terms with the highest significance in aml and bsnmf and snmf in all , ). overall, bsnmf and snmf showed the highest significance for the whole leukemia dataset ). in the medullobalstoma dataset, bsnmf and k-means for the first cluster and bsnmf and svd for the second cluster had the higher weighted p-value than other methods. overall, bsnmf showed the best results  - ). therefore, genes in the clusters created by bsnmf seemed to be more biologically associated in terms of go term annotations than those created by other methods.

the p-values are calculated for each go category and for each pathway resource . the go term  annotation having lower p-values represents that corresponding cluster in terms of sharing go terms  is more relevant biologically. the result for k-means and bsnmf in the aml cluster is only shown. other results are found in the supplement web site. overall, non-orthogonal mfs tend to create more enriched clusters.

the top- ranked genes with the largest coefficient in w matrix of bsnmf may be most explanatory for each cluster . the top ranked  <dig> genes for the all cluster are enriched in significant go terms like response to external stimulus, immune response and cell growth. genes for the aml cluster had are enriched in response to external stimulus, immune response and membrane genes. the gene functions in pubmed indicated that the two sets of  <dig> genes are enriched in chemokines and tumor suppressor genes. genes for the first cluster of meduloblastoma were related to cytoplasm, cell motility and cell growth and/or maintenance and those for the second cluster to cytoplasm, biosynthesis and protein metabolism genes. gene sets for other datasets can be found in the supplement web site.

the mean expression profiles of the gene-wise clusters from the fibroblast dataset were extracted . we clustered genes by using coefficient matrix of genes when we applied mfs. coefficient matrix of genes  can be used to determine cluster membership of genes, that is, gene i belongs to cluster j if the wij is the largest entry in row i. applying k-means algorithm, we clustered genes using original gene expression data matrix. then, we labelled gene-cluster corresponding to the labels of sample-cluster. according to method mentioned above, gene-wise clusters were created by the seven methods. number of gene-wise clusters is five because xu et al.  <cit>  and sharan et al.  <cit>  suggested that optimal number of clusters is five from the fibroblast dataset. while k-means, svd and pca tend to result a few clusters with dominant profiles with the remaining clusters with relatively flat profiles, non-orthogonal mfs tend to create clusters with even dominance. for example, svd result shows one major peak and bsnmf result shows much more peaks. non-orthogonal mfs seem to be more effective in discovering significant patterns.

discussion
there are various clustering-based methods which are proposed by many researchers. these methods have become a major tool for gene expression data analysis. different clustering-based methods usually produce different solutions and one or a few preferred solutions among them should be selected. however, a systematic evaluation study for the methods has not been reported. therefore, we evaluated orthogonal , non-orthogonal  mfs and a traditional clustering algorithm  using seven clustering-quality  and two prediction-accuracy measures  applying to five published datasets. we also included an improving non-orthogonal mfs, bsnmf in the evaluation study.

as a result, we observed that clustering quality and prediction-accuracy indices applying non-orthogonal mfs are better than those of orthogonal mfs and k-means. in respect to results from homogeneity, separation, dunn index, average silhouette width and hubert correlation of cophenetic distance, non-orthogonal mfs had higher value than those of orthogonal mfs and k-means. the gap statistic was lower for non-orthogonal mfs than for orthogonal mfs and k-means. when we tested predictive accuracy for the three datasets with known class labels, we also observed better performance for non-orthogonal mfs than for the rest. we also investigated the biological significance of clustering genes because it is important to discover biological relevant patterns and interpret biologically for analysis of dna microarray gene expression data. when we used enrichment analysis with go terms and biological pathways, we obtained more significant enriched go terms or pathways for non-orthogonal mfs than for orthogonal mfs and k-means. we also identified genes that may be dominantly involved in each subtype. it was demonstrated that bsnmf showed improved performance in prediction-accuracy and biological-enrichment measures, outperforming other non-orthogonal mfs as well as orthogonal mfs and k-means algorithm.

there are various clustering evaluation indices we mentioned. because they have various results upon datasets, they have limitations to suggest which clustering-based method is the best. therefore, improving cluster validation indices is needed to overcome it. we simply suggested a voting scheme that simply combines all the results from the various algorithms and returns the best consensus. improving evaluation indices can be achieved through the integration of results from various evaluation indices using unifying rules.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the clustering performance of orthogonal and non-orthogonal mfs was appropriately compared for clustering microarray data using various measurements. we clearly showed that non-orthogonal mfs have better performance than orthogonal mfs and k-means for clustering microarray data. the characteristic difference among non-orthogonal mfs, orthogonal mfs and k-means algorithm implies that non-orthogonal mfs divided whole data into distinct patterns more evenly than orthogonal mfs and k-means. this study would help for suitably evaluating diverse clustering methods in other genome-wide data as well as microarray data.
