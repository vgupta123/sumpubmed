BACKGROUND
temperate phages are capable of following alternative life styles  <cit> . under appropriate conditions, they grow lytically to form progeny phage particles and lyse the host cell. alternatively, they can form lysogens where they either integrate their chromosomes by site-specific recombination or exist as autonomous extra chromosomal plasmids. because temperate phages are able to move between hosts, they serve as vectors for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. temperate bacteriophages often carry accessory genes that are not necessary for growth or survival of the phage. for example phage gifsy- <dig> whose host is salmonella typhimurium, carries genes that encode pathogenicity factors  <cit> . the gifsy- <dig> gipa gene product contributes to the survival of salmonella typhimurium in the peyer's patches of the mouse intestine and, along with other pathogenicity factors encoded on the related gifsy- <dig> phage, contributes to the ability of the bacterial pathogen to survive within a host organism and cause disease  <cit> .

gifsy- <dig> integrates into and excises from the host chromosome by site-specific recombination. integration of gifsy- <dig> into the host chromosome requires the phage encoded integrase  that catalyzes recombination between a  <dig> base pair core attachment site in the phage chromosome  and an identical sequence in the host chromosome . integration also requires the salmonella typhimurium encoded integration host factor  that likely acts with int to form a nucleoprotein structure called the intasome. this higher order complex facilitates synapsis and the recombination reaction.

deletion analysis showed that excision of gifsy- <dig> requires int and a protein, called xis, encoded by the phage xis gene  <cit> . the gifsy- <dig> xis protein is a typical recombination directionality factor  because it is a small  and highly basic  protein  <cit> . electrophoretic mobility shift assay  and footprinting analyses identified a tripartite xis binding site in attp dna. this initial analysis of the protein-dna interactions also demonstrated that tight, specific binding of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein to dna involves sequential and cooperative interactions of three xis protomers to the minimal attp binding site. these observations suggested that protein-protein interactions might occur between gifsy- <dig> xis monomers similar to results reported for the lambda xis protein  <cit> .

while the gifsy- <dig> phage carries genes that affect the pathogenicity of salmonella typhimurium, the site-specific recombination system has not been characterized. to date only the dna binding sites of the gifsy- <dig> phage xis protein have been characterized. here we begin a mutational and structural analysis of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein to provide more information on the molecular mechanism of gifsy- <dig> excision.

RESULTS
multiple sequence alignment  of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein with rdfs and transcription factors
nmr and crystallization of the lambda xis protein revealed the presence of a short proline loop that connects the n-terminal α-helix region to a β-sheet "wing" structure  <cit> . the clustal w program  <cit>  was used to perform multiple sequence alignment  of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein with predicted and characterized rdf  proteins and certain transcription factors  <cit> . this study indicated that several other rdf proteins and transcription factors also contain proline loop sequences. our results also indicated that gifsy- <dig> xis shows significant homology to these proteins in a short proline loop region  . thus, our results suggest that this proline loop is a conserved motif in a set of transcription factors and rdf proteins.

gifsy- <dig> xis possesses limited homology to these proteins in two other regions. the aligned proteins, shigella flexneri orf <dig>  shigella flexineri rox, p <dig> vis, yersinia pestis ypo <dig>  e. coli z <dig>  salmonella typhimurium gifsy- <dig> xis, phage phi <dig> xis, cp4- <dig> alpa, share limited similarity in the putative helix turn helix  motif . an additional region of homology corresponds to the three strand β-sheet of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein  that are c-terminal to the proline linker region. salmonella typhimurium gifsy- <dig> xis, e. coli phage phi <dig> xis, phage e <dig> xis, phage p <dig> xis, cp4- <dig> alpa, proteins possess several conserved residues in this region. studies with the gifsy- <dig> xis protein suggests that all three regions, the n-terminal h-t-h, the proline loop, and the c-terminal β-sheet, play a role in dna binding. our alignment results may indicate that these several proteins may use three regions for binding to dna.

we also performed multiple sequence alignment studies of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein with the ctndot orf2c protein  <cit>  and the rdf of the conjugative element r <dig> that is identical to the characterized xis of the r <dig> related vibrio cholera phage sxt  <cit> , . all three proteins share homology in an n-terminal region corresponding to residues  <dig> to  <dig> of ctndot orf2c, residues  <dig> to  <dig> of gifsy- <dig> xis, and residues  <dig> to  <dig> of the r <dig> jef protein. each short sequence of homology is predicted to form a h-t-h motif with a probability of 100% for ctndot orf2c, 25% for gifsy- <dig> xis, and 50% for the jef protein  <cit> .

these several alignment studies suggest that the regions of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein are related to two distinct groups of proteins. the first group contains a wide variety of dna binding proteins in which the homology is located mostly in the proline loop and a putative β-sheet. the second group includes the rdfs of conjugative elements. the sequence conservation in this group is located in the putative n-terminal h-t-h motifs of the rdfs. while members of the two groups possess limited homology to the gifsy- <dig> xis protein, the groups do not show significant homology to each other.

structure prediction and motif analysis of gifsy- <dig> xis
the gifsy- <dig> xis protein, like the lambda and tn <dig> xis proteins, is a small basic dna binding protein. previous dna binding studies suggest that gifsy- <dig> xis interacts with dna in a similar manner to the lambda xis protein. these similarities led us to use a modeling technique to determine if gifsy- <dig> xis protein could fold into a structure that is comparable to the structure of the two similar proteins, the lambda xis protein, and the tn <dig> xis proteins, for which structural data exists. the robetta program for 3-dimensional protein structure prediction  <cit>  was used to generate a tertiary folding prediction for the gifsy- <dig> xis protein. a model with a reasonable z-score  was generated by robetta . the model folded the first  <dig> n-terminal residues of the  <dig> residue gifsy- <dig> xis. thus, our model includes two n-terminal α-helixes  followed by a loop containing the proline-rich loop . the loop connects the second helix to a 3-strand β-sheet that spans residues s <dig> to s <dig>  both gifsy- <dig> xis and lambda xis contain an n-terminal h-t-h motif linked to a β-sheet by an intervening proline-rich loop. the overall structural arrangement is similar to the solved nmr and crystal structures of the lambda xis  and the tn <dig> xis proteins . the robetta software did not resolve the remainder of the protein from residues  <dig> to  <dig> 

limited proteolysis of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein
limited proteolysis was performed using proteinase k to identify regions of the protein resistant to proteolysis. the cleavage properties of proteinase k predict that there are multiple potential sites of cleavage across the entire length of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein  <cit> . it is predicted that unstructured loops will be digested more rapidly by the broad specificity proteinase k than structured domains and motifs. thus, fragments of gifsy- <dig> xis that remain after extended periods of proteolysis would result from the presence of compact structural motifs  <cit> . maldi-tof analysis of undigested gifsy- <dig> xis protein resulted in a peak of approximately  <dig>  kda . this mass matches the predicted mass of gifsy- <dig> xis within the margin of error of the maldi-tof apparatus used in these studies. two fragments of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda were generated by the ionization of the protein. these fragments were labile to proteolysis and were not observed in significant amounts in spectra produced by the proteolysis of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein with proteinase k.

gifsy- <dig> xis was digested over a 40-minute period. three proteolytic fragments were identified by sds page analysis . two fragments accumulated in amounts that facilitated n-terminal sequence analysis and matched predicted gifsy- <dig> xis peptide products of limited proteolysis with proteinase k. n-terminal sequence analysis verified the identity of the two proteolytic fragments that spanned residues three to  <dig> and two to  <dig> 

mass spectrum analysis of gifsy- <dig> xis protein digested with proteinase k identified several gifsy- <dig> xis peptides that were specifically generated by proteolysis . these fragments were resistant to further proteolysis by proteinase k. two additional peptides persisted corresponding to molecular masses of  <dig>  kda , and  <dig>  kda . two related peptides, a  <dig>  kda peptide  and a  <dig>  kda peptide , were produced after  <dig> minutes of proteolysis. the  <dig>  kda peptide was identified as the sequence that spans residues six to  <dig>  this fragment persisted for  <dig> minutes. the  <dig>  kda fragment represented the sequence that spans residues two to  <dig> and persisted for  <dig> minutes in our experimental conditions. the single residue difference observed at the n-terminus of fragments represented by peaks  <dig> and  <dig> and peak  <dig> may have been generated by chemical modification, mass spectroscopy-induced fragmentation, or non-specific clipping of the peptides by proteinase k  <cit> . this same phenomenon was observed at the c-terminus of fragments represented by peaks  <dig> and  <dig>  we interpret these results to indicate that fragments represented by peaks  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> likely possess the same proteinase k cleavage site at their n-termini and that fragments represented by peaks  <dig> and  <dig> are likely to possess the identical proteinase k cleavage site at their c-terminal sequences. peaks  <dig>  and  <dig>  were observed after  <dig> minutes of proteolysis and persisted in proteolysis reactions for  <dig> minutes. peak  <dig> represented the gifsy- <dig> xis fragment that spans residues  <dig> to  <dig>  peak  <dig> represents the gifsy- <dig> xis fragment that spans the residues nine to  <dig>  fragments that span the c-terminal tail were not observed during mass spectroscopy analysis of proteinase k digests. this corresponds to our modeling data that suggests that residues  <dig> to  <dig> may participate in forming a c-terminal tail that lacks a defined secondary structure.

peaks  <dig> and  <dig> represent stable proteolysis products and contain the n-terminus of gifsy- <dig> xis that includes the putative h-t-h motif . these two fragments span the n-terminus to the putative proline loop at residue  <dig>  this result may indicate that the proline loop represents an exposed motif that is sensitive to proteolysis. peaks  <dig> and  <dig> represent a larger fragment that spans the n-terminus and includes a significant portion of the c-terminal region of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein. peak  <dig> represents a small fragment that closely corresponds to the predicted gifsy- <dig> xis β-sheet. peak  <dig> contains a fragment that is predicted to span the n-terminal h-t-h motif. fragments that are represented by peaks  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> include both the putative gifsy- <dig> xis h-t-h motif and the predicted β-sheet. these fragments persist after  <dig> minutes of proteolysis with proteinase k and may represent stable motifs within the gifsy- <dig> xis protein.

mutational analysis of gifsy- <dig> xis
in order to identify residues that are necessary for the dna binding activity of the gifsy- <dig> protein we performed chemical and pcr mutagenesis of the gifsy- <dig> xis gene resulting in the isolation of  <dig> substitution mutants along with two amber mutants. the  <dig> mutants isolated by pcr and des chemical methods occurred over almost the entire length of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein, though mutations clustered in the two secondary structures predicted by the robetta modeling program. the n-terminal α-helical region between c <dig> and k <dig> contained six of the  <dig> substitutions. we isolated substitution mutants of four of the six arginine residues in this highly basic region . six more mutations occurred within the predicted β-sheet between residues s <dig> and s <dig>  two mutations occurred within the putative proline loop identified by sequence homology to the several rdf proteins and transcriptional regulators .

the gifsy- <dig> xis mutants with the following residue substitutions were purified: arg29cys, ile16asn, ser51pro, arg25lys, cys17tyr, phe40ser, and ser24phe. all proteins were tested by emsa against a radiolabeled dna probe consisting of the  <dig> base pairs of the gifsy- <dig> attp region. the mutant proteins lacked detectable dna binding activity. to determine the possible structural changes caused by the substitutions, the mutants and the wild-type gifsy- <dig> xis were subjected to limited proteolysis. the concentrations of each protein were normalized to that of the wild-type gifsy- <dig> xis. each protein was then subjected to limited proteolysis with proteinase k. a molar ratio of xis to proteinase of 80: <dig> was used. limited proteolysis of wild-type gifsy- <dig> xis produced three bands on sds-page corresponding to undigested protein, peak  <dig> , and peak three  . analysis of reactions containing the wild-type protein and proteinase k suggests that peaks  <dig> and  <dig> migrate in sds-page as a single band. peaks  <dig> and  <dig> also migrate together as a single band. with the exception of undigested wild-type gifsy- <dig> protein, this fragmentation pattern was equivalent to those obtained from proteolytic reactions that utilized a protein to proteinase ratio of 8: <dig> 

analysis of proteolytic fragments of gifsy- <dig> xis wild type protein and substitution mutants indicates that the small stable proteinase k proteolysis fragments that were observed as peaks  <dig> and  <dig> during mass spectroscopy analysis were produced from proteolysis of the ser51pro and cys17tyr substitution mutants. the larger proteolytic fragment represented by peaks  <dig> and  <dig> were not apparent in the limited digest of the gifsy- <dig> xis ser51pro and cys17tyr mutants. limited proteolysis of the cys17tyr mutant resulted in the production of a band that represents peaks  <dig> and  <dig> and an additional uncharacterized band above  <dig>  kda. these altered peptide fingerprints may be created by changes the 3-dimensional folding pattern of the gifsy- <dig> xis by the substitutions at the 17th and 51st residues. the cys <dig> residue lies within the predicted n-terminal α-helix and the ser <dig> residue lies within the n-terminal β-sheet. this may indicate that the substitutions altered or destabilized the putative interactions of the two predicted motifs. as a result, the relative amount of the small fragment spanning residues  <dig> to  <dig> and residues  <dig> to  <dig> produced by limited proteolysis with proteinase k increased.

CONCLUSIONS
to further analyze the structure of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein, we used clustal w to perform protein sequence-based homology analysis. we produced a multiple-sequence alignment  of the gifsy- <dig> xis and several predicted and characterized rdf proteins, transcription factors, and alpa homologs  <cit> . gifsy- <dig> xis aligned with two distinct groups of proteins, . the proteins in the first group use diverse mechanisms to bind to dna and rna, and include the transcription factors, phage rdfs, the alpa protein, and the multifunctional p <dig> vis protein   <cit> . for example, the gifsy- <dig> xis protein is known to bind to a tripartite binding site composed of direct imperfect repeats in the gifsy- <dig> attp region in a cooperative and sequential manner similar to that of the lambda xis protein  <cit> . p <dig> vis acts as a lambda xis-like excisionase protein by binding to dna in the p <dig> attp region as determined by emsa and dnase i footprint analysis. the p <dig> vis protein also regulates recombination by binding to rna transcripts  <cit> . the shigella flexineri rox protein stimulates int mediated excision of the she pathogenicity island but is not essential for excision  <cit> . it is not known whether the rox protein acts exclusively as a lambda-like rdf or as a transcription factor to stimulate excision. these proteins all possess a fppp loop that follows a predicted n-terminal h-t-h motif. the fppp loop is preceded by a third region of homology that corresponds to the predicted 3-sheet β-strand of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein.

we were led to the characterization of a second group of proteins that share limited homology to the gifsy- <dig> xis by the relationship of the gifsy- <dig> int and the r <dig> int proteins. the gifsy- <dig> phage encodes an int with a 36% identity to the int of the incj conjugative element r <dig>  <cit> . clustal w analysis identified a subset rdf proteins belonging to conjugative elements that share homology with the gifsy- <dig> xis. in the putative n-terminal motif, the gifsy- <dig> xis possesses homology to the orf2c protein of the ctndot conjugative transposon and the r <dig> jef protein . the orf2c protein binds specifically to ctndot dna  and functions in the excision of the ctndot element. the r <dig> jef protein belongs to the rdfs encoded by a newly characterized sxt/r <dig> family of mobilizable integrating conjugative elements. all three proteins are predicted to form homologous n-terminal oriented h-t-h motifs. our structure and sequence analysis of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein may add insight into the possible mechanism by which similar proteins such as the alpa homologs, p <dig> vis, rox, e <dig> xis, and the r <dig> jef proteins might function.

three-dimensional folding analysis with robetta provided results that complemented those we obtained from the sequence-based analysis of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein and related dna binding proteins. robetta analysis  <cit>  of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein indicates that it contains an α-helix rich region near its n-terminus  followed by a β-sheet structure containing three β-strands  . the predicted α-helix sequence and the β-sheet are connected by a putative proline loop region. the remainder of the protein structure was unresolved by the robetta tool. a similar structural arrangement was determined by nmr and x-ray analysis for the lambda xis protein  <cit>  . in the case of the lambda xis protein, the proline loop positions the third dna-binding surface of the lambda xis protein into the minor groove of dna. in contrast, the nmr structure of the tn <dig> xis protein  <cit>  possesses an arrangement similar to the lambda xis even though it does not possess a proline loop that connects the helix-rich region to the β-sheet .

the validation of this gifsy- <dig> xis model was investigated using limited proteolysis with proteinase k and random mutagenesis. maldi-tof analysis of proteolysis products several fragments of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein that are resistant to enzymatic proteolysis. fragments corresponded to residues three to  <dig>  six to  <dig>  nine to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  the two fragments that include residues nine to  <dig> and residues  <dig> to  <dig> correspond to the predicted h-t-h and β-sheet motifs respectively. fragments of the c-terminal tail were not observed. this data corresponds to our prediction that the flexible c-terminal region is accessible to proteases and is not expected to possess a rigid globular structure  <cit> . overall, data from proteolytic reactions agreed with the model generated by the robetta server and suggested that the gifsy- <dig> xis might possess a structure similar to that of the lambda xis and tn <dig> xis proteins.

random amino acid substitutions generated by des mutagenesis and mutagenic pcr occurred mostly within the regions of gifsy- <dig> xis for which structure predictions were obtained. mutations of the gifsy- <dig> xis protein that occur in these regions  result in a loss of dna binding activity. proteolysis studies of wild-type gifsy- <dig> xis and purified xis substitution mutants suggest that the loss of dna binding may be the result of altered or unstable protein structure. our results suggest that residues within predicted helix, proline loop, and β-sheet regions of the gifsy- <dig> xis are essential for both proper folding and function of the protein.

sequence analysis, proteolysis, and mutagenesis suggest that the gifsy- <dig> xis possesses at least two surfaces that are involved in dna binding to gifsy- <dig> attp dna. the gifsy- <dig> xis protein is required for excision of the gifsy- <dig> phage and binds to gifsy- <dig> attp dna. however, the mechanism through which the gifsy- <dig> xis influences the direction of gifsy- <dig> int mediated site-specific recombination is still unknown. our studies suggest that the gifsy- <dig> xis protein possesses sequence characteristics of both transcription factors, lambda phage-like rdf proteins, and separately to an uncharacterized group of rdfs belonging to conjugative transposons. it is not known whether the gifsy- <dig> xis regulates the excision of the gifsy- <dig> phage by means other than binding to specific dna sequences in order to participate in a higher order nucleoprotein complex with gifsy- <dig> int, ihf, and att dna.
