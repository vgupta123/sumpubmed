BACKGROUND
viral structural proteins produced by heterologous expression may have the intrinsic ability to spontaneously self-assemble into highly organized particles – virus-like particles  – that morphologically resemble viral capsid and represent a promising tool for protein engineering. the simplest vlps are composed of a single viral structural protein, such as the assembly-competent envelope or capsid protein . more complex recombinant vlps can be generated by either genetic fusion or co-expression of the vlps with an additional target protein or its segment. the co-expression of the assembly-competent viral structural protein with another viral structural protein or its fusion protein results in so-called pseudotype vlps  <cit> . previous studies show that the major capsid protein vp <dig> of different polyomaviruses can be efficiently produced in yeast expression system in a form of vlps  <cit>  consisting of  <dig> pentamers of the vp <dig> protein  <cit> . hamster polyomavirus  vp <dig> protein has been exploited for the generation of either chimeric vlps harbouring foreign epitopes, or pseudotype vlps when co-expressed with the minor capsid protein vp <dig> that binds within the central 5-fold cavity of each vp <dig> pentamer . moreover, it was demonstrated that hapyv-derived pseudotype vlps represent an efficient carrier for functionally active complex molecules, such as antibodies  <cit> . in these pseudotype vlps, an intact vp <dig> protein is functioning as a carrier mediating vlp formation of both vp <dig> and the modified vp <dig> protein molecule. the c-terminal part of vp <dig> protein is necessary for its interaction with vp <dig> pentamer, therefore, the vp <dig> n-terminus can be shortened and used to join target molecules. the ratio of vp1:vp <dig> proteins in hapyv capsid is 360: <dig>  <cit> , consequently up to  <dig> chimeric vp <dig> molecules harbouring target molecules might be incorporated into one vlp. based on the structure of polyomavirus capsids  <cit> , it was predicted that the inserted target sequence can be displayed on the surface of pseudotype vlps. in contrast to chimeric vlps that do not tolerate long inserts, this approach allowed efficient presentation of large-sized foreign protein sequences as demonstrated for the full-length human tumor-associated antigen her <dig>  <cit> , prostate-specific antigen  <cit> , green fluorescent protein  <cit> , cellular marker p16ink4a  <cit>  and the antibody molecule  <cit> . the first example of a successful expression of a large recombinant antibody molecule on the surface of vlps was generation of hapyv-derived pseudotype vlps harbouring the fc-engineered single-chain antibody  specific to bacterial cytolysin vaginolysin . in this study, the scfv derived from hybridoma cell line producing high-affinity neutralizing antibody against vly  <cit>  was fused with human igg <dig> fc domain comprising the ch <dig> and ch <dig> domains and the hinge region  <cit> . to join the scfv-fc molecule, the n-terminus of vp <dig> protein was deleted and replaced by the scfv-fc molecule. it was demonstrated that the vly-specific scfv-fc fused with hapyv vp <dig> protein and co-expressed with vp <dig> protein in the form of pseudotype vlps was properly folded and exhibited a strong vly-binding activity comparable to that of the parental monoclonal antibody . in contrast, the attempts to produce non-tagged, hexahistidine-tagged and alpha factor-tagged scfv-fc proteins in yeast were unsuccessful due to their low yield, instability and a tendency to form insoluble aggregates . therefore, an approach to display multiple functionally active antibody molecules on the surface of pseudotype vlps that can be easily purified by density-gradient centrifugation may provide a promising alternative to other currently available methods for producing recombinant antibodies.

in the current study, we describe generation of polyomavirus-derived pseudotype vlps harbouring surface-exposed scfv and scfv-fc molecules specific to hepatitis b virus surface antigen . to our knowledge, this is the first example of pseudotype vlps with an anti-viral activity.

RESULTS
generation in yeast of recombinant proteins harbouring anti-hbsag molecule
to generate pseudotype vlps with surface-exposed hbsag-specific antibody molecule, the gene encoding anti-hbsag was fused with gene encoding modified hapyv minor capsid protein vp <dig> and co-expressed together with the gene encoding hapyv major capsid protein vp <dig>  to join the anti-hbsag molecule, the n-terminus of the vp <dig> protein was truncated by  <dig> amino acid  residues. the production of both hapyv vp <dig> protein and the modified vp <dig> protein was induced by adding galactose into yeast growth medium. anti-hbsag scfv comprising variable regions of mouse igg in the orientation of vl-4-vh was derived from the in-house produced hybridoma hb <dig> secreting neutralizing mab against hbsag . the cdna sequences encoding vh and vl regions of anti-hbsag mab were deposited in genbank under accession numbers kp <dig> and kp <dig>  two recombinant proteins harbouring hbsag-specific antibody molecule were produced in yeast s. cerevisiae strain ah22-214p: one carrying the scfv-fc molecule and one carrying the scfv without the fc part .table  <dig> the list of recombinant plasmids for the expression of pseudotype vlps in yeast s. cerevisiae

after induction of the synthesis of recombinant proteins, the lysates of harvested yeast cells were examined by sds-page to evaluate the expression of vp <dig> and the scfv-fc-vp <dig> fused proteins and then subjected to ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradient. the analysis of partially purified recombinant proteins vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig> and vp1/scfv-vp <dig>  by sds-page revealed a protein band of approximately 42 kda that was identified as an intact vp <dig> protein . protein band of  <dig>  kda corresponding to the molecular mass of scfv-fc-vp <dig> fusion protein was detected in the construct # <dig> . protein band of  <dig>  kda corresponding to the molecular mass of scfv-vp <dig> fusion protein was detected in the construct # <dig> . as demonstrated by sds-page, the yield of recombinant proteins after the first purification step was similar and varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg from 1 g of wet yeast biomass. the constructs # <dig> and # <dig> did not differ significantly in the expression levels of an intact vp <dig> protein.fig.  <dig> analysis of recombinant proteins  partially purified on sucrose gradient by sds-page. the asterisk indicates the position of vp <dig> protein; the arrow indicates the position of vp2-fused protein. prestained protein weight marker  is presented on the right of each panel



purification and electron microscopy analysis of recombinant proteins harbouring anti-hbsag molecule
hapyv-derived recombinant proteins vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig>  and vp1/scfv-vp <dig>  were successfully purified by the method adapted for the purification of vlps using cscl density centrifugation. the analysis of purified recombinant proteins by sds-page revealed the expected homogenous protein bands of  <dig>  kda and 42 kda in case of construct # <dig>  and homogenous protein bands of  <dig>  kda and 42 kda in case of construct # <dig> . western blot with the hapyv vp1-specific mab 3d <dig> immunostained the 42 kda protein band in both constructs # <dig> and # <dig> thus confirming the identity of the vp <dig> protein . as a positive control for western blot with vp1-specific mab 3d <dig>  the construct consisting of an intact hapyv vp <dig> protein and the vp <dig> fuse with green fluorescent protein  was used . western blot with hrp-labelled anti-human igg antibody immunostained the  <dig>  kda band present in construct # <dig> thus confirming the identity of scfv-fc-vp <dig> fusion protein . no specific staining was obtained with construct # <dig> lacking the fc part of human igg . as a positive control for western blot with anti-human igg, purified human igg was used .fig.  <dig> analysis of recombinant constructs vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig>  and vp1/scfv-vp <dig>  purified on cscl gradient by sds-page  and western blot with the mab 3d <dig>  and anti-human igg antibody . protein band corresponding to mw of  <dig>  kda represents scfv-vp <dig> fused protein , protein band of  <dig>  kda represents scfv-vp <dig> fused protein  and protein band of 42 kda represents vp <dig> protein . the construct vp1/gfp-vp <dig>  and purified human igg  are used as positive controls for western blot



as calculated from the sds-page with subsequent densitometry analysis, the vp1: scfv-fc-vp <dig> ratio  in the vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig>  is approximately 13: <dig>  while the ratio the vp1: scfv-vp <dig>  in the vp1/scfv-vp <dig>  is approximately 6: <dig>  based on the molecular weight  of the vp2-fused proteins , the calculated average number of the scfv-fc-vp <dig> fused protein per one pseudotype vlp was  <dig> , while the calculated number of the scfv-vp <dig> fused protein per one pseudotype vlp was  <dig> .

the purified recombinant proteins were negatively stained and subjected to electron microscopy  analysis that confirmed an efficient self-assembly of both recombinant proteins to vlps . the pseudotype vlps were approx. 45–50 nm in diameter, which corresponds to the size of intact hapyv capsids and the unmodified recombinant hapyv vp1-derived vlps  <cit> . the size and shape of vp1/scfv-fc- vp <dig> pseudotype vlps  and vp1/scfv-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps  were similar to that of vp1/gfp-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps used as a positive control . the purified pseudotype vlps were further analysed for the hbsag-binding activity and the ability to neutralize hbv.fig.  <dig> electron microscopy pictures of cscl-purified pseudotype vlps stained with 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate solution and analysed by morgagni  <dig> electron microscope. a, vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps ; b, vp1/scfv-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps , c, vp1/gfp-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps . scale bar – 100 nm



hbv-neutralizing activity of pseudotype vlps harbouring anti-hbsag molecule
antigen-binding activity of the purified pseudotype vlps was confirmed by an indirect elisa using recombinant yeast-derived hbsag  coated on the microtiter plate and the hapyv vp1-specific mab 3d <dig> as a detection antibody. both anti-hbsag fused proteins displayed on the respective pseudotype vlps were reactive with the immobilized hbsag . the scfv-fc-vp <dig> fused protein  showed antigen-binding activity in a similar concentration range  as the parental mab hb <dig> used as a positive control . meanwhile, the scfv-vp <dig> fused protein  was reactive with the plate-bound hbsag when added at concentrations exceeding 24 × 10−12 m. the vp1/gfp-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps used as a negative control did not show any reactivity with the immobilized antigen, which confirms the specificity of the elisa . furthermore, the ability of the purified pseudotype vlps to neutralize hbv was assayed in vitro using the hbv infection model of primary tupaia hepatocytes   <cit> . the neutralizing potency of the pseudotype vlps was evaluated in comparison to the parental monoclonal antibody hb <dig> used as a positive control. the pseudotype vlps were used at amounts that correspond to  <dig>  μg/ml to 8 μg/ml of the anti-hbsag fused proteins. the vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps containing the fc part of human igg <dig>  showed higher hbv-neutralizing potency as compared to vp1/scfv-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps : 1 μg/ml  of scfv-fc-vp <dig> fused protein displayed on the pseudotype vlps  were sufficient to induce complete hbv neutralization while 1 μg/ml  of the scfv-vp <dig> fused protein displayed on the pseudotype vlps  induced only partial hbv neutralization . the observed hbv-neutralizing potency of the pseudotype vlps vp1/scfv-fc-vp <dig>  containing 1 μg/ml  of scfv-fc-vp <dig> fused protein was comparable to that obtained with 1 μg /ml  of the full-length parental mab hb <dig>  the specificity of the neutralization test was confirmed by the use of hapyv-derived vp1/gfp-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps  that did not induce hbv neutralization. the incomplete hbv neutralization by the construct # <dig> harbouring the scfv without the fc part might indicate that the scfv molecule is less accessible on the surface of pseudotype vlps as compared to the fc-engineered scfv. the results of the hbv-neutralization test are consistent with the results of an indirect elisa  where the scfv-fc-vp <dig> fused protein displayed on the vlps showed higher antigen-binding activity as compared to the scfv-vp <dig> fused protein.fig.  <dig> hbsag-binding activity of pseudotype vlps harbouring anti-hbsag molecules determined by elisa. concentrations  of anti-hbsag fused proteins scfv-fc-vp <dig> and scfv-vp <dig> displayed on the respective pseudotype vlps are indicated. as a positive control, full-length parental mab hb <dig> is used. as a negative control, vp1/gfp-vp <dig> pseudotype vlps are used

discussion
recombinant vlps are extensively used for various applications, from basic virus assembly and structure studies to the production of human and animal vaccines . due to their repetitive structure, vlps represent an efficient carrier for b and t cell epitopes  <cit> . presentation of large protein sequences on vlps may broaden the spectrum of potential vlp applications, however the long-sized inserts may interfere with the self-assembly competence of the viral carrier protein. to overcome this problem, pseudotype vlps composed of different viral proteins can be generated. in the current study, the capacity of hapyv-derived major capsid protein vp <dig> to self-assemble to vlps and interact with the modified minor capsid protein vp <dig> has been exploited to generate pseudotype vlps with surface-exposed multiple anti-hbsag molecules. the pseudotype vlps expressed in yeast and purified by density-gradient centrifugation were functionally active and showed a potent hbsag-binding and hbv-neutralizing activity comparable to that of the parental mab. the produced pseudotype vlps harbouring surface-exposed anti-hbsag molecules is the first example of anti-viral vlps with virus-neutralizing capability. this approach may be further exploited to develop novel anti-viral tools for a post-exposure treatment of viral infections. prevention of clinical disease in individuals already exposed to viral infection is an important issue of modern biomedicine. recent advances in passive immunoprophylaxis of viral infections, such as rabies and human respiratory syncytial virus infection, are based on monoclonal antibody therapies  <cit> . the in vivo studies have demonstrated the efficiency of neutralizing antibodies in established infections of influenza a, hiv, polioviruses, filoviruses and other viral infections . the vlp approach combining the advantages of virus targeting by the surface-exposed antibody molecule and the capability of vlps to encapsidate and deliver cargo, such as therapeutic nucleic acids or proteins  <cit>  may provide new possibilities for the potential development of effective anti-viral prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.

the current study demonstrates that antigen-binding capability of the pseudotype vlps depends on the structure of the antibody molecule displayed on the vlps. the anti-hbsag molecule was presented on the vp <dig> protein in two different formats – either scfv alone or fc-engineered scfv comprising ch <dig> and ch <dig> domains and the hinge region of human igg <dig>  <cit> . the calculations based on the sds-page and densitometry data indicate that the vp <dig> protein fused with  <dig> aa-long scfv was incorporated into the pseudotype vlps with higher efficiency  as compared to  <dig> aa–long fc-scfv . however, construct # <dig> containing  <dig> times higher amount of anti-hbsag scfv molecules showed much lower hbsag-binding activity in elisa and hbv-neutralizing potency in the in vitro hbv infection assay as compared to construct # <dig> harbouring fc-engineered scfv molecules. the observed difference might be explained by a better accessibility of the fc-engineered scfvs on the surface of vlps. the quantity of anti-hbsag molecules incorporated into the pseudotype vlps of our study  is consistent with a previous report where approx.  <dig> molecules of anti-vly fc-scfv-vp <dig> molecules were found to be displayed the pseudotype vlp  <cit> . based on the resolved crystal structures of the virions of sv- <dig> and murine polyomavirus, a maximum of  <dig> vp <dig> molecules could be incorporated into one pseudotype vlps as this corresponds to the number of vp <dig> protein pentamers that compose the vlp  <cit> . the current study clearly demonstrates that the number of large fusion proteins to be incorporated into a pseudotype vlp may vary according to the actual size of the modified vp <dig> molecule. furthermore, the pseudotype vlps harbouring multiple virus-neutralizing antibody molecules may represent a promising platform for therapeutic vaccines against acute or chronic viral infections. in case of hbv, construction of pseudotype vlps combining different neutralizing antibodies directed against both hbsag and pres <dig> sequences  <cit>  might provide a potent anti-viral tool with a broad hbv-neutralizing capacity. for human use, the scfvs derived from human mabs would be of special interest  <cit>  to avoid their enhanced immunogenicity after presentation on pseudotype vlps.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study demonstrates that hapyv-derived pseudotype vlps are suitable carriers for antibody molecules, both in the format of scfv and fc-scfv. the pseudotype vlps harbouring the fc-scfv-vp <dig> molecule show higher antigen-binding activity and virus-neutralizing potency as compared to those harbouring the scfv-vp <dig> molecule. this difference might be explained by a more efficient exposure of the fc-engineered scfv molecule on the surface of the pseudotype vlps as compared to the scfv molecule.

the produced pseudotype vlps harbouring surface-exposed anti-hbsag molecules is the first example of anti-viral vlps with virus-neutralizing capability.

the pseudotype vlps harbouring multiple functionally active antibody molecules with virus-neutralizing capability represents a novel platform for the construction of therapeutic vaccines with a potential application for post-exposure or therapeutic treatment of viral infections. the vlp approach combining the advantages of virus targeting by the surface-exposed antibody molecule and the capability of vlps to encapsidate and deliver cargo, such as therapeutic nucleic acids or proteins, might be further exploited for the development of novel efficient anti-viral strategies.
