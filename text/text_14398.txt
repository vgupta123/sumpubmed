BACKGROUND
remarkably, only  <dig> percent of s. cerevisiae genes are known to be essential for viability  <cit> , as determined by single gene deletions for nearly all of the predicted  <dig>   <dig> genes. similarly, genome-wide rnai knockdown experiments conducted in c. elegans produced non-viable phenotypes for 10% of the  <dig>   <dig> tested genes  <cit> . the remaining genes that are not required for viability under laboratory conditions are termed "non-essential," though their status more likely reflects the extent to which individual genes can compensate for one another in the event of a null mutation. the concept of genetic buffering  <cit>  has received support from recent studies utilizing high-throughput methods   <cit>  to systematically implement double null mutations for large sets of gene pairs. one major finding of these systematic studies is the prevalence of synthetic sick or lethal  interactions. ssl interactions are revealed when two genes that are not essential for viability as single loss-of-function mutants combine to form a double mutant with a lethal phenotype.

a key finding in one of the original system-wide studies conducted by tong et al.  <cit>  is that genetic interactions tend to run orthogonal to physical interaction. in light of this observation, several recent studies have sought to model this phenomenon in the context of biological networks  <cit> . kelley and colleagues  <cit>  used probabilistic models to validate the observation that genetic interactions are often oriented orthogonally to physical interactions, and therefore can be modeled as "between-pathway" interactions. this interpretation is consistent with the theory that genetic buffering confers robustness to molecular complexes and pathways functioning in parallel. the authors also found that, in some cases, genetic interactions may overlap with physical interactions, and can therefore be modeled as "within-pathway" models. this is consistent with an earlier finding that  <dig> percent of gene pairs exhibiting a ssl interaction also share a physical interaction  <cit> , which is  <dig> times more frequent than would be expected by chance. protein complexes enriched for genetic interactions tend to indicate that a particular complex is essential, most likely due to a lack of buffering partners. finally, ye and colleagues  <cit>  offer additional evidence supporting the notion that genetic redundancy can be interpreted at the complex level, as they use the congruence of synthetic lethal interactions, defined as the similarity in ssl partners in a genetic interaction network, to predict complex membership. a common theme developed in these studies is that genetic redundancy is to a large extent defined at the level of molecular complex, a property that can be exploited to predict novel interactions.

in addition to the aforementioned studies that used physical interaction data to model synthetic lethal interactions, recent work has demonstrated that synthetic lethal interactions can be leveraged to resolve molecular complexes  <cit> . in one study, collins et al. utilized genetic interaction data to provide finer resolution on the molecular function of  <dig> genes involved in various aspects of s. cerevisiae chromosome biology. the authors constructed an epistatic miniarray profile  from an exhaustive test of pairwise interactions, from which they were able to characterize the extent to which physically interacting proteins act coherently in a common function. the results from this study suggest that genes that have been systematically tested to interact physically are more likely to form a stable complex if they share common genetic interactions. similarly, st. onge et al. implemented  <dig> double deletion experiments corresponding to an exhaustive pairings of  <dig> genes related to dna repair. by measuring the fitness of the double deletion strains in the presence of dna damaging chemicals, the authors were able to detect previously unknown functional relationships and pathway orderings  <cit> . thus, these studies collectively suggest that physical interaction data can be used to model genetic interactions, and, conversely, genetic interaction data can be leveraged to provide greater resolution to molecular complexes and pathways that have been inferred from systematic protein-protein interaction and gene co-expression data.

despite the considerable benefits of high-throughput methods such as sga and dslam, the adoption of ssl screens into the standard toolbox of molecular geneticists would impose considerable cost and time requirements. for example, in order to experimentally map out pairwise gene interactions for the s. cerevisiae genome, an exhaustive search would mandate / <dig> =  <dig> million double null experiments. in the case of c. elegans, one would need to implement / <dig> =  <dig> million experiments to cover all pairwise interactions. this understates the complexity of such an undertaking, as experimentalists need to account for varying culture conditions and hypomorphic alleles for essential genes. considering these practical limitations, computational techniques that predict genetic interactions are of potential value in providing molecular biologists with leading candidates for pairwise interactions. towards this goal, roth and colleagues  <cit>  reported success using topological information in conjunction with functional genomic information, which was used to build a decision tree-based classification system. interestingly, it was not the functional genomic data but the 2-hop network characteristics that conferred the strongest predictive power. 2-hop network motifs capture the relationship between a pair of genes, e.g. a-b, and a third gene, c. in this example, genes a and b share a physical interaction, while genes a and c are synthetic lethal. the 2-hop scheme would suggest that genes b and c might also be synthetic lethal. building on this concept, we apply random walks on biological networks to expand genome coverage and prediction accuracy. furthermore, we incorporate ssl interactions as well as all experimentally validated non-interactions into our algorithm for measuring topological relatedness, resulting in increased prediction accuracy. our method is capable of detecting ssl relationships for both the "between-pathway" and "within-pathway" topologies . we report considerable performance gains in predicting ssl gene interactions as characterized by roc curves.

approach
our technique is initiated by performing random walks on the individual biological networks, producing proximity matrices for each of the networks. subsequently, the proximity matrices are combined with the genetic interaction data during the procedure for measuring the topological relatedness between two genes, which is run separately on both the synthetic sick or lethal genetic interaction dataset and the dataset of experimentally tested non-interactions. as a result of this procedure, there are two variables for each biological network , which are ultimately incorporated into the decision tree classifier as a feature vector to predict genetic interactions.

random walks
the random walk procedure with restarts is a computationally efficient method to profile the neighborhood of a node  <cit> . a biological network, g, is represented by g = , where v represents the nodes  and e represents the edges . the restart node, s, takes on a restart probability, c =  <dig> , and the procedure is run separately for each node in the biological network. ultimately, v and e are translated into a column-normalized proximity matrix, p, which is subsequently used to solve for the stationary vector ps→. the stationary vector ps→ represents the steady-state distribution of the neighborhood for a particular node. an overview of the procedure is provided below.

input: the biological network g = ;

output: the proximity matrix p;

let rs→ be the restart vector with value  <dig> for all of its entries except a  <dig> for the entry denoted as node s;

let a be the column normalized adjacency matrix as defined by the edge matrix, e;

*the stationary vector can be obtained by either solving for the dominant eigenvector or running iteratively until convergence.  <cit> .

algorithm for measuring topological similarity
performing the random walk procedure produces proximity matrices for each of the biological networks, which are subsequently used to quantify the likelihood of potential genetic interactions. we applied an algorithm to measure the topological relatedness between two genes that iterates through each gene pair in the ssl dataset as well as the non-interaction dataset . figure  <dig> illustrates a simplified case where the genetic interaction dataset consists of one entry of an interaction between genes  <dig> and  <dig>  figure 1a portrays a biological network with  <dig> genes connected by  <dig> edges, forming two distinct complexes. the genetic interaction between genes  <dig> and  <dig> runs orthogonal to the two complexes. therefore, the neighbors of genes  <dig>  which are genes  <dig> and  <dig>  will be associated with gene  <dig>  likewise, genes  <dig> and  <dig> will be implicated with gene  <dig>  the strength of the predicted association between genes  <dig> and  <dig>  for example, will depend on the proximity between genes  <dig> and  <dig>  as previously mentioned, the proximity between two nodes is determined by the random walk procedure. we find that this system uses the natural information flow inherent to a biological network to predict likely genetic interactions, which is suitable for detecting both intra- and inter-cluster interactions. if, in contrast to figure 1a, a protein complex were significantly enriched for genetic interactions , our procedure would implicate genes in the local neighborhood . for each of the biological networks, we generate two separate matrices for the interaction and the non-interaction datasets. these procedures are run separately, and the respective measures from the ssl and non-interaction datasets are considered independently by the decision tree classifier in order to optimize the relative weights between the two types of interactions. the data were partitioned 5-fold prior to running the algorithm, such that the testing instances, comprising 20% of the interactions and non-interactions, were not included in the measurement of topological similarity.

classification
we used version  <dig> . <dig> of the weka  <cit>  machine learning software to classify gene pairs as either interacting  or non-interacting. specifically, we used the j <dig> decision tree implementation provided with the package. we applied a 5-fold, stratified cross-validation scheme whereby four fifths of the instances are used for training and the other one fifth of the data is held out for testing .

scoring of gene pairs
each gene pair is assigned a probability according to the leaf to which it is directed. each leaf in the decision tree is associated with a probability according to the ratio of interacting pairs versus the total number of gene pairs assigned to that leaf during the training process. in order to generate roc curves, we varied the threshold probability associated with the "ssl/interacting" class by a factor of  <dig>  over a range of  <dig> to  <dig>  thereby generating  <dig>   <dig> data points for each roc curve.

RESULTS
we compared the performance of our random walk-based method to the leading methods of wong et al.  <cit>  and zhong et al.  <cit> . we note that while other existing studies have successfully modeled genetic interactions  <cit> , these techniques are not optimized for predicting novel interactions and are therefore not incorporated into our performance measurements. we first offer a comparison of the random walk method against the two established methods. subsequently, for the random walk method, we show the predictive ability of each of the individual datasets in both s. cerevisiae and c. elegans, the added value provided by non-interaction data, and the robustness of our method under conditions where varying levels of information are held out. the performance gain associated with our method is present in both s. cerevisiae and c. elegans.

comparison to established methods
using standard receiver operating characteristic  curves, our random walk method was compared to the 2-hop method of wong et al.  <cit>  and to the more recent method of zhong et al.  <cit> . for both the s. cerevisiae and c. elegans systems, the random walk method outperformed these two methods by a considerable margin. for s. cerevisiae, we achieved an area under roc curve  of . <dig> versus . <dig> for the 2-hop method. for c. elegans, we achieved  <dig>  with our method, compared to  <dig>  for the 2-hop technique and  <dig>  for the zhong et al. approach. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the roc curves for s. cerevisiae and c. elegans, respectively. expanded network coverage and more accurate measurement of network proximity are the most likely explanations for the performance improvement over the 2-hop approach. the lower performance of the zhong et al. method most likely reflects the fact that this method is geared towards predicting close-range functional relationships, due to reliance on likelihood scoring of isolated gene pairs. stated differently, to glean insight into the possibility of a genetic interaction between genes a and b, the zhong et al. method requires prior evidence of an interaction  between genes a and b. at the same time, prior evidence regarding genes a and b can only be used to implicate genes a and b. in contrast, the random walk method considers, for each data type, the network neighborhood of individual genes in an interacting pair, thus allowing the cross-pollination of information between genetic interaction data and other biological data represented as networks.

integrating the biological networks
figures  <dig> and  <dig> exhibit the classification accuracy for the individual biological networks. in both s. cerevisiae and c. elegans, the genetic interaction data was the most informative for the purposes of predicting genetic interactions, consistent with the results from wong et al.  <cit> . in c. elegans, worm protein-protein interactions were second to genetic interactions in terms of predictive ability, followed by physical interactions between homologs in human and yeast . in yeast, go interactions and protein-protein interactions were roughly equivalent and were secondary to that of genetic interactions in predictive power .

non-interaction data improves performance
an important finding of this study is that classification performance is improved by including experimentally validated non-interactions into our algorithm for measuring topological similarity. this value is incorporated into the feature vector as an additional variable. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show that the combination of synthetic sick or lethal  interactions and non-interactions, when combined, achieve a much greater area under roc curve. for c. elegans, the ssl-only and non-interaction-only data produced auc values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, whereas classification on the combined data resulted in an auc of  <dig> . for s. cerevisiae, the ssl-only and non-interaction-only data produced auc values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, whereas the classification on the combined data produced an auc of  <dig> . these results suggest that the density of non-interactions between complexes is indicative of a lack of redundancy, just as ssl interactions are suggestive of redundancy between complexes.

performance as a function of available information
in addition to measuring the area under the roc curves, one may gain insight into the relative power of the respective methods by quantifying classification performance with varying levels of information, where the amount of "information" represents the fraction of interactions and non-interactions that are utilized by the procedure for measuring network relatedness. for example, in the case where 20% of the information is incorporated into the algorithm for measuring topological similarity,  <dig> out of  <dig> instances will be included in the algorithm.

by varying the fraction of interactions and non-interactions utilized by the procedure for measuring network relatedness, we found our system to be fairly robust to markedly reduced information. figures  <dig> and  <dig> indicate that the effects of reducing information from  <dig> percent to  <dig> percent are relatively small for both organisms. in the case of s. cerevisiae, the area under the roc curve is reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  upon reducing the information from  <dig> percent to  <dig> percent . similarly, in c. elegans, the auc is reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  upon reducing the information from  <dig> to  <dig> percent . in both organisms, the random walk-based classifier outperforms the 2-hop method across all levels of information. interestingly, in both s. cerevisiae and c. elegans, the random walk method utilizing  <dig> percent of the information outperforms the 2-hop method using  <dig> percent of the information .

controlling for biases in the genetic interaction datasets
to date, the majority of studies conducting tests for synthetic sickness or lethality consist of a small set of query genes crossed against a larger set of target genes. consequently, the resulting datasets are asymmetric, and it is imperative to consider the possibility that the random walk method might actually be biased towards predicting query-query interactions rather than genetic interactions. to control for this possibility, we ran our analysis on two distinct symmetric subsets of the s. cerevisiae composite genetic interaction dataset. first, we utilized the naturally symmetric dataset from collins et al., which consists of 746-by- <dig> query gene interactions. next, we derived a 132-by- <dig> symmetric dataset from the  <dig> query genes in the tong et al. dataset. analysis on both of the symmetric subsets produced slightly lower auc scores as compared to composite dataset. the random walk method, which scored an auc of  <dig>  for the composite dataset, produced auc values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the collins et al. and tong et al. subsets, respectively . the 2-hop method, which scored an auc of  <dig>  for the composite dataset, produced auc values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the collins et al. and tong et al. subsets, respectively . these results suggest that the asymmetric nature of composite dataset might produce a small degree of bias towards predicting query-query interactions.

discussion
to date, the strongest predictor of genetic interactions has invariably been based on information related to network topology combined with knowledge of already established genetic interactions  <cit> . while it would ideal to be able to predict genetic interactions without the knowledge of existing genetic interactions, the predictive ability of methods lacking this information has proven to be fairly limited. furthermore, the current era of genomics is characterized by organisms for which the entire set of pairwise genetic interactions are only partially known. although high-throughput methods will soon be able to systematically cover all of the pairwise interactions in the s. cerevisiae genome, the research community is still faced with the task of mapping interactions in less tractable organisms and for interactions between three or more genes. therefore, the goal of creating a genome-wide map of genetic interactions remains very important, as increasingly it appears that synthetic interactions amongst genes are representative of functional redundancy between the complexes and pathways to which the genes belong  <cit> . in summary, our method might be particularly useful in situations were the genetic interactome of an organism is only partially mapped, or for lesser-studied organisms for which homologous information from a close relative is available. the performance gains associated with the random walk method were sustained when using an alternate classifier. to demonstrate this feature, we use the logistic regression classifier  <cit> , since it handles non-linear relationships between variables. using the logistic regression classifier implementation from weka  <cit> , for s. cerevisiae, the random walk method obtained an auc of  <dig>  versus an auc of  <dig>  for the 2-hop method. for c. elegans, the random walk and 2-hop methods resulted in scores of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the logistic regression classifier produced lower auc values for all data points as compared to the decision tree classifier. the higher scores obtained by the decision tree classifier might be attributable this classifier's inherent ability to capture second order interactions between variables. for example, we observed that the performance of the decision tree classifier peaked upon the incorporation of non-interaction scores, whereas the performance of the logistic regression classifier was less consistent in this regard .

the performance of the zhong et al. classifier was relatively weak compared to either of the two methods utilizing network topology. we suspect that the approach of zhong et al., which uses bayes' formula to derive a likelihood ratio to score gene pairs for each piece of evidence, would be better suited for predicting general functional relationships between genes. indeed, lee et al.  <cit>  recently published work using a very similar framework to predict functional similarities between gene pairs. however, in contrast to zhong et al., the authors used go functionality as their training data, of which there is considerably more information that is better suited for measuring the degree to which proteins may function coherently. and we reiterate that, for the purpose of predicting genetic interactions, the random walk method offers the advantage of combining genetic interaction data with information regarding functional network topology.

while this study focuses on predicting genetic interactions, using random walks as a method for capturing properties of biological networks may be applied to other areas of bioinformatics. one potential application concerns the prediction of novel transcription factor-gene interactions, which was recently implemented using a 2-hop scheme  <cit> . additionally, our findings will hopefully encourage the reporting of non-interactions for all studies in reverse and forward genetics. we found that non-interactions considerably improve the performance of our classifier, and these gains represent a lower bound on the potential benefit, as non-interaction data was not available for some of the studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented a method based on applying random walks to biological networks to capture aspects of network topology that can be used to classify potential genetic interactions as either synthetic lethal or non-interacting. our method, which is generalizable to all types of biological networks, is likely to perform well with limited information, as estimated by holding out large portions of the ssl interactions and non-interactions.
