BACKGROUND
the human microbiome represents the trillions of microbes that naturally inhabit the human body, the vast majority of which reside within the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . major advances in sequencing technology have allowed for investigations of the microbiome in the context of health and disease. large-scale studies of the westernized human microbiome, including the nih funded roadmap human microbiome project   <cit>  targeting several body sites and the european commission funded metagenomics of the human intestinal tract  <cit> , have defined the healthy human microbiome, providing a reference for subsequent studies into the interactions between microbes and their environment in the context of host immunity and/or genetics.

systematic studies aimed at understanding the complex interactions between the host and microbiota have demonstrated that the composition of the gut microbiota varies with age , race/ethnicity  <cit> , geographical location  <cit> , and dietary intake . the role of the microbiota in modulating host immune responses to infectious pathogens is also increasingly recognized  <cit> . indeed, the composition of the gut microbiota has been shown to influence both local  and systemic  immune responses.

among parasitic pathogens, plasmodium falciparum malaria, which is transmitted by anopheles mosquitos, imposes the greatest disease burden worldwide. the world health organization  estimates that  <dig>  billion people are at risk of malaria in  <dig> countries. in  <dig>  there were approximately  <dig> million cases of malaria and an estimated  <dig>  deaths, 90 % of which occurred in africa, with children under 5 years accounting for 78 % of all deaths  <cit> .

in areas of intense malaria transmission, immunity to life-threatening malaria is typically acquired by early childhood, whereas older children remain susceptible to repeated bouts of febrile malaria through adolescence, eventually acquiring near-complete immunity to the disease caused by blood-stage malaria parasites by early adulthood  <cit> . however, despite repeated infections over years, sterilizing acquired immunity to p. falciparum infection seems to occur rarely  <cit> . the nature of the human immune response that protects from p. falciparum infection and the disease it causes is complex and only partially understood  <cit> . indeed, the quality of the immune response and the clinical outcome during any given p. falciparum infection can vary greatly between and within individuals  <cit> . although host and parasite genetic factors  <cit>  clearly contribute to the heterogeneity in immune and clinical responses to malaria, it is likely that environmental factors such as the host microbiota also play a role. for example, a recent mouse study demonstrated that anti-α-gal antibodies—induced by the presence of escherichia coli o86:b <dig> in the gut—are cytotoxic to α-gal-expressing plasmodium sporozoites, and thus protect mice from mosquito-transmitted plasmodium infection  <cit> . in the same report, an association was observed between anti-α gal igm levels and protection from p. falciparum infection in malian children and adults residing in an area of intense malaria transmission  <cit> , suggesting that the host microbiota may play a role in susceptibility to p. falciparum infection in humans. in addition, li et al.  <cit>  noted that experimental infection of mice with plasmodium berghei resulted in altered metabolite profiles that they attributed to a disturbance of the gut microbial community caused by the parasite. however, it is currently unknown in humans if the composition of the gut microbiota modulates the risk of p. falciparum infection or the risk of developing malarial disease once p. falciparum blood-stage infection is established.

to investigate the potential interplay between p. falciparum and the gut microbiota, we analyzed the bacterial communities in stool samples collected from a cohort of  <dig> malian children and adults just prior to an intense malaria transmission season. community composition was determined by sequencing the 16s ribosomal rna  gene using high-throughput next generation sequencing technology. in a prospective cohort study we examined the relationship between the gut microbiota composition of these individuals and their subsequent risk of p. falciparum infection and febrile malaria. we also compared the microbiota composition of this cohort with published studies conducted in other regions. consistent with prior studies, we found that gut microbial diversity in this cohort increased with age, although the overall microbiota profile was distinct from cohorts in other regions of africa, asia and north america. age-adjusted cox regression analysis revealed a significant association between the microbiota composition before the malaria season and the prospective risk of p. falciparum infection during the ensuing malaria season, while no relationship was observed between microbiota composition and the risk of developing febrile malaria once p. falciparum infection was established.

RESULTS
characteristics of study subjects
from may  <dig> – may  <dig>   <dig>  we enrolled  <dig> healthy individuals in this cohort study. stool was collected from all subjects at the time of enrollment. a subset of  <dig> individuals was randomly selected in an age-stratified manner for stool microbiota analysis . of these  <dig> subjects,  <dig> subjects  were asymptomatically infected with p. falciparum blood-stage parasites by pcr at enrollment when stool was also collected. the prevalence of intestinal helminths at enrollment was near zero, consistent with the mass-drug treatment program in this region of mali, whereas the prevalence of schistosoma haematobium in the urine was  <dig>  %, mostly among adolescents and adults. the prevalence of sickle cell trait  was  <dig>  %. detailed demographic and clinical data stratified by age are shown in table  <dig>  consistent with our findings in the entire cohort  <cit> , longitudinal analysis during the ensuing malaria season showed that the risk of febrile malaria decreased with increasing age in the subset of individuals in this study, with the exception of infants under the age of 1 year whose risk was intermediate between children and adults , presumably due to the protective effect of maternal antibodies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> selection of study subjects for stool microbiota analysis

diversity and composition of the microbiota in mali stool samples
sequence data were successfully generated from  <dig> out of the  <dig> stool samples. after processing the raw sequence data, the combined dataset consisted of  <dig> , <dig> sequences. however, not all sequences could be confidently assigned taxonomy to the genus level; therefore we denote these sequences by appending the tag unclassified to the end of their taxonomic assignment . the taxonomic assignments were used to generate a sample-taxa count matrix. in the combined dataset, bifidobacterium, streptococcus, and family ruminococcaceae unclassified were the three most abundant taxonomic groups, accounting for  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of sequences, respectively.

operational taxonomic units  were identified in these data by clustering sequences at 97 % sequence identity, and were used to compute microbial community diversity  in these samples. subsequently, the relationship between diversity and age was assessed using a linear model. this analysis revealed that diversity increased with age in this cohort ; a similar trend was observed for both genders separately .fig.  <dig> increase in microbial taxa diversity with age in the malian cohort. for each stool microbiota sample, the alpha diversity  of the microbial community  was plotted against the individual’s age in years . the blue line is the linear model fit and has a positive slope 



the sample-taxa count matrix was further analyzed using a dirichlet multinomial mixture  modeling framework  <cit>  to identify sample groups . an evaluation of the model fit  revealed that two dirichlet components  provided the best fit for these data. figure  <dig> shows a two-dimensional ordination of these samples that was generated using non-metric multidimensional scaling  based on bray-curtis dissimilarity between samples. the individuals comprising the sample groups dc <dig>  and dc <dig>  were significantly different in terms of age  and taxonomic profiles , but had similar gender distributions. specifically, the average ages of individuals in dc <dig> and dc <dig> were  <dig>  years and  <dig>  years, respectively. the most abundant taxa in the older dc <dig> group were family ruminococcaceae unclassified , family lachnospiraceae unclassified , and faecalibacterium , while the most abundant taxa in the younger dc <dig> group were bifidobacterium  and streptococcus  .fig.  <dig> an nmds ordination of the microbiota samples. the taxonomic profiles of the samples were used to compute a sample dissimilarity matrix  and this matrix was used to compute an ordination of the samples in two dimensions . the goodness of fit  associated with this ordination is  <dig> . the circles in this plot denote the samples. the two sample groups  identified using the mixture modeling are denoted in red  and blue . the average ages for the groups are  <dig>  years  and  <dig>  years . asterisks denote the vectors of mean taxa proportions associated with the corresponding dirichlet components

comparison of mali, malawi, hmp, and msd cohorts
next, we compared the gut microbiota composition of the mali cohort with data from the malawi, hmp, and msd microbiome studies described in material and methods. the four datasets were analyzed based on taxonomies of their constituent samples. dmm modeling identified  <dig> dirichlet components  , each with a different taxonomic profile . the  <dig> dirichlet sample groups largely fell along cohort lines . for example, the dirichlet components dc <dig> and dc <dig> that were identified by dmm modeling of the mali cohort were largely preserved as components cc <dig> and cc <dig>  respectively. like cc <dig>  which was comprised exclusively of mali samples, cc <dig> had a high abundance of bifidobacterium and streptococcus, but only contained samples from the malawi cohort; however, the proportions of bifidobacterium and streptococcus were different in cc <dig>  compared to cc <dig> . the hmp samples were predominantly split across cc <dig> and cc <dig>  both of which were dominated by bacteroides, but at different abundance levels . the msd cohort was mostly split across cc <dig>  cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  all of which were dominated by prevotella to varying degrees  and family enterobacteriaceae unclassified . cc <dig> consisted of malawi samples and was also dominated by prevotella .

relationship between gut microbiota and persistent p. falciparum infection, incident p. falciparum infection, and incident febrile malaria in the malian cohort
we investigated the relationship between the gut microbiota composition and three distinct clinical phenotypes in the malian cohort: persistent p. falciparum infection, incident p. falciparum infection, and incident febrile malaria. these three phenotypes are described in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> definition of persistent p. falciparum infection, incident p. falciparum infection, and incident febrile malaria. this longitudinal cohort study in mali was designed to take advantage of the sharply demarcated 6-month malaria season  and 6-month dry season  during which there is either intense or negligible p. falciparum transmission, respectively. stool microbiota composition was determined for all study subjects in a cross-sectional survey at the end of the 6-month dry season. for each subject, we examined the relationship between stool microbiota composition and the risk of persistent p. falciparum infection, incident p. falciparum infection and incident febrile malaria. individuals with p. falciparum infections that persisted without symptoms through the dry season were identified by pcr analysis of fingerprick blood samples in a cross-sectional survey at the end of the 6-month dry season . for subjects who began the malaria season without p. falciparum infection, incident p. falciparum infections during the ensuing malaria season were detected prospectively through bi-weekly pcr analysis of fingerprick blood samples. for all subjects who became infected with p. falciparum blood-stage parasites, incident cases of febrile malaria  were detected prospectively during the ensuing malaria season through weekly physical examination by the study physician and blood smear microscopy if malaria was suspected



in a cross-sectional analysis at the end of the 6-month dry season, a period of negligible malaria transmission  <cit> , we first compared the gut microbiota composition of individuals with persistent, asymptomatic p. falciparum blood-stage infection versus uninfected individuals. p. falciparum infections detected at the end of the 6-month dry season are generally acquired during the preceding transmission season and persist through the dry season at low levels without causing symptoms. this analysis was carried out using the dmm framework, but in a supervised manner with subjects classified as either persistently infected  or uninfected . an nmds ordination of the samples along with their p. falciparum infection status at the end of the dry season is shown in fig.  <dig>  among the  <dig> persistently infected subjects we identified two dirichlet components pp <dig>  and pp <dig> , with average subject ages of  <dig>  years and  <dig>  years, respectively . among the  <dig> uninfected subjects we identified two components pn <dig>  and pn <dig>  with average subject ages of  <dig>  years and  <dig>  years, respectively . the mean vector of taxa proportions for component pp <dig>  is very close to that of component pn <dig>  indicating that these two subject groups have very similar taxonomic proportions, with no statistically significant differences . the mean of component pp <dig>  was not as close to the means of either of pn <dig> or pn <dig>  however, the only taxa in this component that had a significantly different proportion compared to its values in pn <dig> and pn <dig> was bifidobacterium . together, these findings suggest that age may be a stronger predictor of gut microbiota composition than p. falciparum infection status at the end of the 6-month dry season .fig.  <dig> nmds ordination of the mali samples on the basis of p. falciparum infection status at the end of the 6-month dry season. samples from subjects with persistent, asymptomatic p. falciparum infection at the end of the dry season fall into two components pp <dig>  and pp <dig> ; samples from p. falciparum-uninfected subjects fall into two components as well – pn <dig>  and pn <dig> . the mean vector of each component is labeled with an asterisk in their respective color. the average ages for the groups are  <dig>  years ,  <dig>  years ,  <dig>  years  and  <dig>  years 

fig.  <dig> mean proportions  of the twenty most abundant taxa in the two dirichlet components pp <dig>  and pn <dig> . the lower and upper 95 % credible intervals are shown as error bars



next, we examined the relationship between the stool microbiota composition present before the malaria season and the prospective risk of becoming infected with p. falciparum blood-stage parasites during the ensuing 6-month malaria season. for this analysis we only included subjects who were not infected with p. falciparum  before the malaria season and who had completed study follow-up through the end of the ensuing 6-month malaria season . dmm modeling of the microbiota data obtained from these p. falciparum uninfected subjects identified two dirichlet components fm <dig>  and fm <dig> . these two sample groups had distinct taxonomic profiles . bifidobacterium  and streptococcus  were the most abundant taxa in fm <dig> while family ruminococcaceae unclassified , and family lachnospiraceae unclassified  were the most abundant taxa in fm <dig>  in addition to these taxa, other taxa including faecalibacterium, blautia, order clostridiales unclassified, family prevotellaceae unclassified, and escherichia/shigella were differentially abundant across the two sample groups . the average age of subjects in fm <dig> and fm <dig> was  <dig>  years and  <dig>  years, respectively. during the ensuing malaria season, incident  p. falciparum blood-stage infections in these subjects were detected through bi-weekly pcr analysis of fingerprick blood samples. we compared the time to first p. falciparum infection in the fm <dig> versus fm <dig> sample groups  by generating kaplan-meier plots and performing log-rank analysis . we noted a statistically significant delay in time to first p. falciparum infection  for fm <dig> subjects  compared to fm <dig> subjects . moreover, cox regression analysis accounting for age, gender, anemia, hbas, s. haematobium infection, splenomegaly and distance to the river  revealed a statistically significant increased risk of p. falciparum infection for fm <dig> subjects versus fm <dig> subjects .fig.  <dig> mean proportions  of the twenty most abundant taxa in the two dirichlet components fm <dig>  and fm <dig> . the lower and upper 95 % credible intervals are shown as error bars

fig.  <dig> stool microbiota composition is associated with the prospective risk of p. falciparum infection but not the prospective risk of febrile malaria. kaplan-meier plots showing time to  the first pcr-confirmed p. falciparum blood-stage infection  and  the first febrile malaria episode among subjects with documented p. falciparum infection, stratified by the two dmm sample groups fm <dig> and fm <dig>  p values comparing fm <dig> to fm <dig> were calculated by the log-rank test



finally, we examined the relationship between the stool microbiota composition present before the malaria season and the prospective risk of developing febrile malaria in subjects who became infected with p. falciparum blood-stage parasites during the ensuing malaria season. again, for this analysis we only included subjects who were pcr negative for p. falciparum infection before the malaria season and then became infected with p. falciparum during the ensuing malaria season, as detected through bi-weekly pcr of fingerprick blood samples. malaria immune subjects  were defined as those whose p. falciparum infections never progressed to febrile, symptomatic malaria despite weekly active clinical surveillance; whereas malaria susceptible subjects  were defined as those whose p. falciparum infection progressed to a febrile malaria episode . on the basis of the dmm modeling of the microbiota data described above, the same fm <dig> and fm <dig> sample groups had similar proportions of malaria immune and susceptible subjects , suggesting that gut microbiota composition is not associated with the risk of febrile malaria once a p. falciparum blood-stage infection is established. on the basis of the same dirichlet sample groups fm <dig> and fm <dig>  we also generated kaplan-meier plots and performed log-rank analysis for time to first febrile malaria episode . we found no statistically significant difference between fm <dig> and fm <dig> for time to first febrile malaria episode using either the case definition for clinical malaria  or the less restrictive definition of fever and any level of p. falciparum parasitemia.

discussion
in this study we aimed to describe the composition of the gut microbiota in an age-stratified rural west african population that is exposed to intense seasonal p. falciparum transmission. we compared the gut microbiota composition in this population with studies conducted in other regions. in an exploratory analysis we also investigated the relationship between the gut microbiota composition and the prospective risk of p. falciparum infection as well as the risk of developing febrile malaria once p. falciparum infection is established.

like studies conducted in other regions  we found that the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota increased with age in both males and females. we found in this cohort that the most dynamic shifts in microbiota composition occur before the 3– <dig> years of age, possibly related to the transition from breast milk to solid foods  <cit>  and then changes occur more gradually through adolescence and adulthood. we observed clear differences between the composition of the gut microbiota in this study and that reported in studies conducted in other parts of the world, underscoring the diversity of gut microbiotas across geographic regions. although the non-uniformity of the 16s variable region that was selected for sequencing across these studies may have impacted taxa detection  <cit> , several sample groups shared similar taxa, albeit at different abundance levels. the relative impact of factors underlying the observed variability in microbiota composition across geographic regions such as diet, antibiotic exposure, genetics, and co-infections remains to be determined.

using a dmm framework we identified two subject groups with distinct microbiota profiles  that exhibited statistically significant differences in the prospective risk of p. falciparum infection after accounting for age and other potential confounders. the gut microbiota of subjects at lower risk of p. falciparum infection  contained a significantly higher proportion of bifidobacterium and streptococcus compared to subjects at higher risk of p. falciparum infection . this finding raises the possibility that modulation of the microbiota with pre- and/or pro-biotic nutritional supplementation that promotes the growth of commensal organisms like bifidobacterium, particularly in the neonatal period  <cit> , may be of benefit in the context of malaria. importantly, studies indicate that natural components of human milk stimulate the growth of bifidobacterium . clearly, further studies are needed to understand the potential interactions between specific components of the microbiota, innate/adaptive immune responses, and susceptibility to malaria and other pathogens that commonly affect this population.

also of potential interest, the gut microbiota of fm <dig> subjects contained a significantly higher proportion of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia/shigella compared to subjects at higher risk of p. falciparum infection   - an intriguing finding in light of a recent mouse study in which anti-α-gal antibodies induced by the presence of α-gal-expressing escherichia coli in the gut, were cytotoxic to α-gal-expressing plasmodium sporozoites in the skin, thus protecting mice from plasmodium infection  <cit> . because not all enterobacteriaceae express α-gal  <cit>  we are unable to ascertain from the present 16s data whether strains in these samples express α-gal. a functional screen for the expression of this gene or a metagenomic approach would be required to answer this question. it will be of interest in future studies to use higher resolution techniques to determine if differences in the proportion of α-gal expressing enterobacteriaceae are associated with the risk of p. falciparum infection. moreover, additional studies are needed in various malaria-endemic areas to determine if the findings here can be replicated, since the association we observed between microbiota composition and p. falciparum infection risk may have occurred by chance or may be confounded by other factors not measured in this study.

importantly, we did not observe a relationship between the gut microbiota composition and the prospective risk of developing febrile malaria once p. falciparum blood-stage infections were established, possibly due to a lack of statistical power. however, we observed clear changes in the microbiota composition over the age range during which clinical immunity to febrile malaria is slowly acquired in areas of intense malaria transmission  <cit> , suggesting that age-associated changes in the gut microbiota from infancy to adulthood may play a role in shaping the quality of the immune response to malaria as individuals gradually acquire clinical immunity to malaria, hypotheses that could be further tested in larger longitudinal studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of this study underscore the diversity of the gut microbiota with age and across geographic regions. in addition, the preliminary finding of an association between gut microbiota composition and p. falciparum infection risk suggests that strategic modulation of gut microbiota composition could decrease p. falciparum infection risk in malaria-endemic areas, potentially as an adjunct to partially effective malaria vaccines.
