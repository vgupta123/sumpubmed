BACKGROUND
pork is the most consumed meat in european union countries  <cit> . accordingly, swine research has been focused on the improvement of meat quality and growth performance parameters in the last decades. the genetic selection of commercial pig lines has reduced subcutaneous fat content while decreasing simultaneously the intramuscular fat  content. imf is a key meat quality trait, and the sensory properties of pork are negatively affected when imf drops below 2– <dig> %  <cit> . moreover, due to anatomic and physiologic similarities with humans, pig has been used as an excellent biomedical model to study a wide range of human health conditions  <cit> , in particular concerning nutrient digestion, absorption and metabolism  <cit> .

some feeding strategies based on dietary amino acid supplementation and reduced protein diets  have been suggested to improve fat partitioning in pigs , that is, to increase imf content which contributes to improve pork sensory traits, such as tenderness and juiciness, without affecting backfat thickness. in addition, arginine is classified as a nonessential amino acid for healthy adults because it is synthesised in most mammals, including humans, pigs or rats  <cit> . arginine plays multiple physiological functions in animals, one of which is the ability to enhance lipolysis through the expression of key genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that arginine supplementation reduces fat accumulation in white adipose tissue of obese models, such as humans  <cit> , rats  <cit> , sheep  <cit>  and growing finishing pigs  <cit> .

moreover, the essential amino acid leucine plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis in the muscle  <cit> . some studies suggested that diets with high levels of leucine can increase imf content in finishing pigs  <cit> . in addition to the supplementation of dietary amino acids, arginine and leucine, the use of rpd for increasing imf content in pigs, with less effect on subcutaneous fat deposition, has also been described  <cit> . donato et al.  <cit>  reported that leucine supplementation during caloric restriction in rats also results in more fat loss and improves protein synthesis in both liver and muscle. nonetheless, the effect of arginine and leucine supplemented to low protein diets on hepatic fatty acid metabolism remains elusive.

an experiment with fifty-four commercial crossbred male pigs fed on normal and reduced protein diets, with or without arginine and leucine addition, was carried out to study the effect, individual or combined, of dietary protein level and amino acids supplementation on lipid metabolism of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. we reported previously that dietary arginine supplementation does not have a significant effect on imf content, but increased total fat in subcutaneous adipose tissue  <cit> . however, some studies with dietary supplementation  <cit>  found an increase in imf content without changing pork quality. thus, arginine might be involved in the differential regulation of some key lipogenic genes expression in pig’s muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue  <cit> . rpd increased imf content and total fat content in subcutaneous adipose tissue. moreover, leucine supplementation on rpd does not seem to result in an additional increase of imf and total fat in subcutaneous adipose tissue  <cit> . these results suggest that adipogenesis and lipogenesis might be differently regulated in pig’s longissimus lumborum muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue  <cit> . in the present study, and following on the same animal trial  <cit> , we hypothesised that dietary arginine supplementation, rpd and rpd with leucine promote hepatic lipogenesis in pigs. to test this hypothesis, we assessed the fatty acid content and composition, as well as the gene expression levels of essential lipogenic enzymes and associated transcription factors.

RESULTS
the present study reports the additive effect of dietary arginine and reduced protein diets, with or without leucine supplementation, on hepatic fatty acid composition and transcriptional profile of key lipogenic enzymes and transcription factors, using commercial crossbred pigs. this experiment also produced results on pigs’ performance and carcass traits that are presented elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, low-protein diets decrease animal performance in lean pigs, while dietary arginine has no effect on growth parameters  <cit> . moreover, dietary leucine on low-protein diets does not seem to play any additional effect on pig growth performance or pork quality traits.

plasma metabolites
the biochemical profile in plasma is shown in table  <dig>  a significant interaction between arginine supplementation and protein level  was consistently observed across plasma lipids. total lipids increased with rpd but decreased with rpdl, and also increased with arginine supplementation but decreased with arginine combined with rpd or rpdl . the same variations were found for triacylglycerols . total cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol increased with rpd and with arginine supplementation . also, the rpd in combination with arginine decreased total cholesterol . in addition, hdl-cholesterol decreased with arginine in combination with rpd, but increased with leucine . this change contrasts with ldl-cholesterol, which decreased with arginine combined with rpd and leucine . vldl-cholesterol increased with rpd, but decreased with rpdl . also, arginine supplementation increased vldl-cholesterol, but in combination with rpd decreased its levels , which in turn were increased with leucine .table  <dig> effect of dietary arginine, leucine and protein level on plasma metabolites of commercial crossbred pigs1

discussion
in order to gain insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms that control hepatic lipid metabolism in pigs fed reduced protein diets with amino acids supplementation , the gene expression levels of essential lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes and associated transcription factors were evaluated. furthermore, the effect of dietary arginine and leucine supplementation combined with protein level and molecular mechanisms responsible for fat partitioning between adipose tissue and muscle are available elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, diets supplemented with arginine, either alone or in combination with the rpd or leucine, promoted, in contrast to longissimus lumborum muscle, a lipogenic effect on adipose tissue. in addition, an increase on imf content of longissimus lumborum muscle was observed in pigs fed on low protein diets  <cit> . dietary arginine had no effect on growth performance parameters , but when dietary protein level was reduced by 19%, adg was negatively affected  <cit> . this is probably explained by the lysine reduction on these diets  <cit> . results on pigs’ performance and feed efficiency are published in madeira et al.  <cit> . moreover, entire male pigs were used because these animals are leaner than gilts or castrated barrows, thus having low eating quality, and being the most used in the portuguese swine industry.

data presented here indicate that, in the liver, dietary treatments affected more plasma metabolites than fatty acid composition or the transcriptional profile of essential lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes and associated transcription factors. a significant interaction between arginine supplementation and protein level was consistently observed across all plasma lipids. arginine supplementation in normal protein diet increased plasma lipids, in particular total lipids, total cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol, vldl-cholesterol and triacylglycerols. arginine and reduced protein diets increased individually total lipids but, when combined, a clear decrease in total lipids was observed, suggesting a synergistic effect of both variables. l-arginine has important roles in physiology and overall metabolism; hence, it is beneficial for nutrient metabolism, immune response and circulatory functions in animals and humans  <cit> . fatty acid binding protein one  prevents lipotoxicity of free fatty acids and regulates fatty acid trafficking and partition  <cit> . its mrna expression level was increased with arginine supplementation, which can be related to the increase of total lipids in plasma. our results indicate that dietary arginine increase concentrations of total lipids, vldl-cholesterol and triacylglycerols in plasma, which could be associated with increased fat accretion in the carcass  <cit> . in contrast, hu et al.  <cit>  reported that arginine supplementation improved nutritional status and lean tissue mass, while beneficially reduced ammonia, free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and cholesterol levels in the plasma, as well as white fat in the body. in line with hu et al.  <cit>  and contrasting to our own data, he et al.  <cit>  reported that dietary arginine reduces vldl-cholesterol, lipids and triacylglycerols concentrations in piglets. also, tan et al.  <cit>  reported that 1% of arginine supplemented on diet fed to growing finishing pigs for 60 days reduced positively serum triacylglycerols by 20% and whole-body fat content by 11%, while increasing whole-body skeletal muscle content by  <dig> %. the variations of total lipids in plasma and related metabolites support the notion that arginine and its products play an important role in the metabolism of energy substrates  <cit> . arginine stimulates the secretion of growth hormone and insulin in mammals, thus playing an important role on the regulation of protein metabolism  <cit> . in our study, arginine supplementation did not affect plasma hormones, insulin and leptin. fu et al.  <cit>  reported that arginine increases fatty acid oxidation and glucose in insulin-sensitive tissues, thereby reducing accretion of fat in white adipose tissues. nevertheless, in our study, arginine supplementation in npd decreased glucose concentration in plasma. diacylglycerol acyltransferase  catalyses the final step in triacylglycerol biosynthesis by converting diacylglycerols and fatty acyl-coa into triacylglycerols  <cit> . in our study, leucine increased dgat mrna expression level but decreased triacylglycerols content which stands out as an apparent contradiction. this remains to be elucidated. moreover, apoliprotein a-v  is a key regulator of plasma triacylglycerols and inhibits the production of vldl-cholesterol, the major carrier of triacylglycerols  <cit> . herein, the apoa <dig> mrna expression was unaffected by dietary treatments.

blat et al.  <cit>  reported that pigs fed on high dietary protein levels relative to normal, had increased insulin levels and consequently, increased homa-ir values. nonetheless, insulin resistance index was found within the normal physiological range accepted for pigs, i.e., below  <dig>   <cit> , even if arginine supplementation decreased homa-ir. as being so, this is a finding that does not deserve further pathophysiological understanding. insulin stimulates fatty acid synthesis which leads to triacylglycerols formation and storage  <cit> . accordingly, hepatic total fatty acids tend to decrease with arginine supplementation. also, arginine affected all plasma hepatic markers, alt, ast and ggt, but once again, the values observed are within the reference ranges for pig   <cit> .

previous studies have shown that dietary supplementation with arginine reduces plasma concentrations of urea in pigs  <cit> . contrarily, in our study, arginine supplementation kept unchanged the urea levels in plasma. it is known that arginine is an intermediate in the urea cycle  <cit> . unexpectedly, low protein diets increased urea levels, although the values found are still within the reference range for pig, which is 100–300 mg/l  <cit> , therefore suggesting unaffected renal function.

in our study, leucine supplementation did not affect total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol, contrarily to results described by zhang et al.  <cit> . those authors  <cit>  reported that leucine supplementation decreases glucose metabolism, reduces diet-induced insulin resistance and lowers plasma glucagon levels and hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase mrna expression in rats. in our study, leucine supplementation increased plasma glucose in combination with arginine supplementation without affecting insulin.

dietary treatments had no impact on total fatty acids in the liver, which partially concurs with similar mrna levels found for stearoyl-coa desaturase , one of the key lipogenic enzymes for fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . together with subcutaneous fat, liver plays an important role in mediating fatty acid metabolism in pigs, mainly triacylglycerols synthesis  <cit> . as previously reported, dietary arginine did not increase imf in pigs but enhanced total fat in subcutaneous adipose tissue by 6%  <cit>  in parallel with the up-regulation of the lipogenic enzyme scd  <cit> . our results indicate that mrna expression level of fabp <dig> increased with arginine supplementation, although arginine only increased 15: <dig> and 20: <dig> saturated fatty acids in the liver. rpd, with or without leucine supplementation increased ccaat/enchancer bonding protein alpha , that plays a key role in the regulation of adipogenesis and lipogenesis  <cit>  and decreased lipin  <dig>  mrna expression levels, that is crucial for adipocyte differentiation, maintenance of mature adipocyte function, and lipogenesis  <cit> . rpd activated lipogenic mrna levels and increased imf content by approximately 45–48%  <cit> ; consequently, rpd up-regulated cebpa in the liver. likewise, the expression level of lpin <dig> decreased because lpin <dig> is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes fat oxidation and suppresses de novo lipogenesis  <cit> . however, rpd did not increase total fatty acids in the liver. this finding indicates that low protein diets do not seem to promote fatty liver, a pathophysiological state related to various metabolic disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia  <cit> .

the reduction of dietary protein increased oleic acid  percentage and tended to increase mufa proportions  in the liver. this finding was not supported by scd gene expression levels which, as already stated, were unchanged by rpd. scd is a key enzyme for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis by catalysing the 9-cis desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-coa  <cit> . conversely, rpd decreased sfa and n- <dig> pufa percentages in the muscle. similarly to the liver, rpd enhanced mufa proportions in subcutaneous adipose tissue, mainly at the expenses of 18:1c <dig> increase  <cit> . the restriction of dietary protein combined with leucine did not change fatty acid composition in liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a significant interaction between arginine and protein level was determinant on results found for plasma lipids and hepatic markers. data clearly indicated that the effect of supplemented arginine is dependent on dietary protein level. specifically, arginine supplemented to a normal protein diet increased total lipids, total cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol, vldl-cholesterol and triacylglycerols, but promoted no changes on total fatty acid content in the liver. hence, arginine does not appear responsible for enhancing hepatic fatty acid deposition. in a similar manner, leucine supplementation and dietary protein reduction promoted no changes on hepatic fatty acid content. once again, restriction of dietary protein does not seem accountable for hepatic fatty acid deposition. the lack of effect of arginine or dietary protein in the liver is probably directly related to the minor contribution of liver to lipid metabolism in the pig. ultimately, arginine, leucine and dietary protein reduction do not seem to contribute for fatty liver onset, which is in opposition to the effects previously described in a companion paper for adipose tissue and skeletal muscle  <cit> .
