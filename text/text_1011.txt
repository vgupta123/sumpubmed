BACKGROUND
with the advance of high-throughput technologies such as dna microarray, chromatin immunoprecipitation dna chip   <cit> , yeast two-hybrid assays  <cit>  and co-immunoprecipitation screens  <cit> , various kinds of whole genome scale data are available, shedding light on the regulatory mechanisms in the biological system. several new computational methods have been developed to combine various kinds of data to construct regulatory networks  <cit> . in addition, several researchers have strived to infer regulatory pathways connecting the known causal perturbation to the affected genes using physical interaction networks  <cit> . these inferred pathways could explain consequences of perturbations such as gene knockout effects. if the causal factor is unknown, however, inference of the causal factor from the consequences ) is rather challenging.

to address this, tu et al.  <cit>  and sutras et al.  <cit>  integrated tf-dna interactions and protein-protein interactions to map which gene among expression quantitative trait loci  was the causal factor responsible for the observed changes in the downstream gene expression. however, the candidate causal factor was restricted to genes located within eqtls, and their methods could not be widely applied if such information was not available. in another work, pollard et al.  <cit>  tried to discover underlying molecular causes of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus consistent with the expression changes based on  <dig>  molecular cause-and-effect relationships assembled from literature. yet the power of such kind of approach relies greatly on the size and quality of cause-and-effect relationships, which are often hard to collect.

increasing amount of molecular interactions, including tf-dna interactions, protein-protein interactions  and protein post-translational modifications , mapped from high-throughput technologies may provide significant information about cause-and-effect relationships. previous approaches of associating tfs with expression changes were often based on direct binding targets of tfs  <cit> , which were derived either by upstream sequence matches to a consensus binding motif  <cit> , or by tf-dna interactions from chip-chip experiments  <cit> . several studies, however, have pointed out the low overlap between direct targets bound by a tf and transcriptionally affected genes caused by perturbation to the same tf  <cit> . backup in regulatory pathways is one possible reason for the low overlap, which leads to no expression changes observed for most direct targets of a tf under this tf knockout  <cit> . the ability of tfs to affect gene expression through ways other than direct transcription may be another reason. given the complexity of regulatory networks, if only tf-dna interactions were used and simple flat regulation pathway was modeled, the power of those methods for inference of associated tfs would be limited. integrating tf-dna interactions with other directed interactions and considering hierarchical and multi-layer regulatory pathways through which tfs affect expressions of their downstream genes may be helpful. protein-protein interactions provide limited information because ppis normally imply no regulation direction. protein post-translational modifications have rarely been considered for gene expression based causal inference, since ptm usually can not be detected at expression level.

here we present a tf-centered downstream gene set enrichment analysis to identify potential causal regulators responsible for gene expression changes. integrating tf-dna interactions and ptm information, we constructed multi-layer regulation models progressively to derive possible downstream gene sets of a specific tf. ptm are incorporated because their regulation roles to proteins activation status are certain. tfs activity change would cause differential expressions of downstream genes, even though tfs themselves do not change at expression level. compared with the method using only direct tf-dna interactions, our method correctly identified five more actual perturbed tfs in knockout experiments  <cit>  and six more tfs in overexpression experiments  <cit> . the results suggest that in addition to direct transcription, indirect transcription and ptm are also responsible for the downstream effects of tfs perturbation, especially for tfs overexpression. potential regulatory pathways downstream of three perturbed regulators — snf <dig>  aft <dig> and sut <dig> — were given to demonstrate the power of incorporating indirect transcription and/or ptm information.

furthermore, our method successfully identified several known and novel potential regulators involved in the transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth  <cit>  and in the pheromone response  <cit> , some of which were validated by their changes in expression and/or phosphorylation status. additionally, downstream regulation pathways of sut <dig> in the transition process and aft <dig> in the pheromone response were also supported by the mrna and/or phosphorylation changes of their mediating tfs and/or “modulator” proteins.

our results suggest that pathways through which tfs regulate the expression of downstream genes are condition dependent. with our methodology, many novel potential causal regulators and downstream regulation models may be proposed and evaluated. our method provides a valuable framework for analyzing gene expression data to identify causal regulators in the context of tf-dna interactions and ptm information, which may benefit disease mechanism studies and identification of potential interfering targets.

methods
the schema of our method is shown in figure  <dig>  for a perturbed condition, the method ranked the potential causal regulators based on the significance of the overlap between downstream gene sets of each tf and the changed expression profiles, namely, the list of degs. compared with most previous approaches using direct tf-dna interactions alone  <cit> , the downstream gene sets of each tf here were derived by integrating tf-dna interactions and ptm information.

recent studies have shown that gene perturbation effects could be mediated by ppi networks as well  <cit> . it has been suggested that when the path length from the initial tf to the last tf is greater than  <dig>  the significance of the overlap between the observed degs and the expected targets of the actual perturbed tf is decreased  <cit> . thus, we constructed regulation models with the path length from the initial tf to the last tf being equal to or less than  <dig>  for examples, paths like tf-tf-tf, or tf-kinase-tf, are length  <dig> paths. models were built progressively by gradually adding tf-dna regulation layers and ptm information, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  six models were constructed in total and classified into one-layer regulation models, two-layer regulation models and three-layer regulation models, which were defined according to the number of tf-dna regulation layers. one-layer regulation models included simple direct model  and ptm-mediated direct model . simple direct model  only considered direct binding targets of tf a, while ptm-mediated direct model  extended model i to further include direct targets of other tfs  post-translationally modified by tf a. model ii could be further extended by another ptm layer, i.e., including direct targets of other tfs post-translationally modified by tf b. it had been found that downstream genes in this model were the same with those in model ii for all tfs and only upstream kinases, such as elm <dig>  reg <dig>  sak <dig>  glc <dig> and tos <dig>  were involved in the model. therefore this model was not included in our present work since the method was mainly aimed to identify tfs but not kinases responsible for expression changes. in the future, this model will be included when the work is extended to discover causal signal molecules and kinases. two-layer regulation models consisted of two-layer cascade regulation model , ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation model , and hybrid two-layer cascade regulation model . two-layer cascade regulation model  was built by extending model ii to further include second-layer targets of tf a mediated by tf c and tf d, while ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation model  was constructed by extending model ii to further include second-layer targets of tf a mediated by tf e which is modified by x . hybrid two-layer cascade regulation model  combined model iii and model i v, i.e., considering second-layer targets of tf a mediated by both protein expression changes  and protein modification changes . three-layer regulation model  was obtained by extending model v to further include third-layer targets of tf a mediated by tf f. model vi could not be further extended since the length of these paths tf a-tf c-tf f, tf a-‘modulator’ x-tf e, and tf a-tf b-tf d was all equal to  <dig>  thus there was only one three-layer regulation model.

possible downstream genes of a tf were defined as the expected targets of this tf. six possible expected targets for tf a were denoted as . the observed set of degs was denoted as d={degs}. the overlap significance between six expected targets and the observed set of degs was calculated using the hypergeometric distributions .   

six p-values were obtained for tf a to evaluate the significance of the overlap between six possible expected targets of tf a and the observed degs. to determine the most likely model through which tf a was responsible for expression changes, we selected the model in which the most significant overlap occurred . in this way, the overlap significance between the expected targets of tf a and the observed degs under this tf perturbation would be improved. however, the overlap significance between expected targets of other non-perturbed tfs and the degs might increase simultaneously, which would introduce much noise and descend the rank of the actual perturbed tf in the candidate list . we assumed that if a tf functioned through a model rather than model i, the overlap of its expected targets with the degs would be more significant in this model than that in model i, while the overlap of most of other tfs in this model would not be more significant than that in model i. on the contrary, if many tfs got more significant overlap between their expected targets and the observed degs in a model than that in model i, these tfs would rank before the actual perturbed tf and thus the actual perturbed tf would be missed. that is, the model in which many tfs obtained more significant overlap than that in model i was unacceptable. we compared the distribution of overlap p-values obtained by model i and other models using the wilcox rank sum test. those models whose distribution of overlap p-values was significant different from model i  were unacceptable. the minimum p-value obtained at all acceptable models for each tf was used to rank and evaluate the tf as the potential causal regulators . by selecting acceptable models based on the background distribution of overlap significance, we could correctly identify the actual perturbed tf and discover the most possible regulation pathway downstream of this tf perturbation .      

for the observed list of degs, we inferred the most likely causal regulators and the underlying pathways. p-values being equal to or less than  <dig>  were considered to be significant and the corresponding tfs were reported as valid findings. if the actual perturbed tf was a valid finding and ranked at the top  <dig> of candidates, this tf was said to be correctly identified. we also tested our method using different numbers of top rank candidates to decide the correct identifications . we found that the criterion about the number of top ranks had little impact on the performance of the method , suggesting that the standard we used for the valid finding  was quite stringent and most of valid findings ranked at the top. for previous methods that downstream genes of tfs were obtained through simple direct model  using tf-dna interactions, only those tfs that affected gene expression through direct transcription could be correctly identified. in contrast, constructing hierarchical and multi-layer regulation models by the integration of tf-dna interactions and ptm information, our method was expected to find not only tfs that affected gene expression through direct transcription, but also those that affected gene expression through indirect transcription and post-translational modifications.

we also built models in the following ways and compared the results from them with those from the six models: 1) we constructed models progressively without any constraint on the path length, i.e. with the path length from the initial tf to the last tf being greater than  <dig>  we found that many tfs eventually got almost the same set of downstream genes when the path length was long enough and the method failed to infer most of the actual perturbed tfs. 2) we did not construct all six models fixedly but tried to infer which model explains the expression data best. for example, unlike direct targets of tf a, b, c and d comprising the downstream genes of tf a in the two-layer cascade regulation model , which combinations of tf b, c and d were inferred to comprise the regulation models of tf a in the case that regulation effects of tf a could be mediated by tf b, tf c and tf d. if direct targets of tf a and tf b obtained the most significant overlap with observed degs, this p-value was considered as the overlap significance obtained by tf a as causal regulators and used to rank the candidates. it was found that much more noise was introduced in this way and many actual perturbed tfs ranked lower in the candidate list. it is very likely that six models may not cover all the possible regulation topologies. however, we think some topologies happen at very low frequencies in real biological systems. if all the possible models were considered, it would increase the model space and lower the performance. therefore, we limited our work to the six models with the belief that most frequent regulatory scenarios in the biological systems were well represented.

data collection
post-translational modifications  information was obtained from s. cerevisiae phosphorylation network  <cit>  and ptm-switchboard  <cit> . the former contains the majority of the well-characterized kinase- and phophatase-substrate relationships in s. cerevisiae  manually curated from literature. the latter constitutes the relationship between the tf and its “modulator” protein, which alters the tf’s activity through post-translational modifications. tf-dna interactions were obtained from  <cit> , which presented a framework for integrating seven distinct sources of evidences to score all possible tf-target interactions. we extracted all tf-target interactions with lls > <dig>  yielding a total of  <dig>  high confidence interactions. by integrating ptm and tf-dna interactions,  <dig> tfs with the number of downstream genes being no less than  <dig> in any one of the six models were selected as candidates .

two tf perturbation data sets  <cit>  were used to verify the method. hu et al.  <cit>  profiled the transcriptional response in s. cerevisiae strains with individual deletions of  <dig> tfs. among  <dig> tfs,  <dig> are in aforementioned list of  <dig> candidates. the transcription responses of these  <dig> tfs knockout strains were selected to evaluate the power of the method. chua et al.  <cit>  provided the microarray expression data resulting from overexpression and/or deletion of  <dig> tfs, among which, those experiments of overexpression and/or deletion of tfs common with  <dig> candidates were selected. as a result, overexpression data of  <dig> tfs and deletion of  <dig> tfs were chosen. the standard p<= <dig>  was used to select degs for hu et al. data  <cit>  and |z|>= <dig> was used for chua et al. data  <cit>  here. we also tested our method using different standards. we found that similar overlap p-values were obtained for most tfs even though different standards were used. several tfs with very different overlap p-values often ranked at the top of the candidates. furthermore, their ranks at the candidate list changed little, though their overlap p-values between the expected targets and the observed degs  changed a lot . therefore, it may be concluded that our method is robust against the standard to select degs.

our method was further applied to two datasets with no primary knockout or overexpression perturbation to discover important regulatory tfs involved in certain biological processes. expression profiles during a transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth were obtained from  <cit> . expression data and phosphorylation information under pheromone response were from  <cit>  and  <cit> .

RESULTS
method verification by the knockout data of  <dig> tfs
the results showed that  <dig> actual perturbed tfs out of  <dig> knockout data were correctly inferred. if only simple direct model  was considered,  <dig> were correctly inferred, among which, hsf <dig> was missed by our method due to its slightly dropped rank beyond the threshold. hsf <dig> ranked 20th if only model i was used but ranked 22nd by our method. it may be due to the increased noise level introduced by considering more regulation models. figure  <dig> shows the overlap significance of the expected targets of  <dig> tfs and the observed degs under these tfs’ knockout, obtained from the most likely model versus that obtained from model i. it could be seen from the figure that model i was employed by most tfs, suggesting that deletion of these tfs strongly affected expressions of their immediate direct targets. six tfs — pho <dig>  gln <dig>  aft <dig>  snf <dig>  aro <dig> and pdr <dig> — were correctly identified by our method but missed if only model i was used. all of the tfs with the exception of aft <dig> got more significant overlap in the most likely model, and their ranks in the candidate list were also improved. for example, pho <dig> ranked 64th if only model i was used, while it ranked 14th if model iv was also considered. as another example, pdr <dig> ranked 26th by using model i alone, but ranked 3rd if model iii was also considered. the more significant overlap and the improved ranks in the most likely model, rather than model i alone, suggested that the effects of these tfs knockout might transmit through more complex models. especially for pho <dig> and snf <dig>  the overlaps between the downstream genes from the most likely model  and the degs under their knockouts were  <dig> times more significant than that from model i. this finding suggested that it was highly likely that the regulation pathway of pho <dig> knockout was ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation model and pathway of snf <dig> knockout was highly likely to be ptm-mediated direct model. another two tfs, aft <dig> and gal <dig>  were both correctly identified by our method and by model i. however, their overlaps between the expected targets from the most likely model and the observed degs under their knockout were also much more significant than that from model i and their ranks were also improved, suggesting the potential regulation pathways of aft <dig>  and gal <dig>  knockout. these results demonstrated that ptm and cascade regulation helped explain tfs’ knockout effects. however, hu et al.  <cit>  did not observe any indication that indirect transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation was responsible for the effects of a tf deletion. they drew the conclusion by comparing tf deletion target sets against each other or by comparing binding targets against deletion ones. this led to bias since the effects of a tf deletion might not be mediated by only one tf, but by cooperation or combination of several tfs. for example, the effects of snf <dig> deletion are mediated by msn <dig>  mig <dig>  sip <dig> and gln <dig> . in another example, the effects of aft <dig> deletion are mediated by cooperation of several tfs including msn <dig>  msn <dig>  dig <dig> and ste <dig> .

in higher eukaryotes, multiple tfs simultaneously, cooperatively or competitively, regulate genes. for those tfs forming transcription complex to coordinate the expression of genes, such as arg80/arg <dig>  swi4/swi <dig> and mbp1/swi <dig>  they were all identified as causal regulators when one of their cooperative tfs was knocked out. for examples, arg <dig> ranked 1st  and arg <dig> ranked 6th  in the arg <dig> knockout experiment, and arg <dig> ranked 1st  and arg <dig> ranked 19th  in the arg <dig> knockout experiment. for those partially functionally redundant tfs  or promoter occupancy competitive tfs , however, they could not be correctly identified as causal regulators in their knockout experiments. it is possibly because that those tfs’ knockout effects can be partially or fully compensated by their backup tfs or competitive tfs.

the results  of the knockout data of  <dig> tfs are listed in additional file  <dig> 

possible regulatory pathways downstream of snf <dig> knockout
snf <dig> achieved the most significant overlap p-value  from ptm-mediated direct model , while the overlap p-value was  <dig>  when only simple direct model was used. this may suggest that snf <dig> affects gene expression through a ptm-mediated way, i.e., snf <dig> functions as a kinase rather than a tf. this finding is consistent with previous literature. the snf1p kinase complex, which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues, is essential for regulating the transcriptional changes associated with glucose depression through its deactivation of the transcriptional repressor mig <dig>  <cit> . snf <dig> is involved in the activation of s. cerevisiae heat shock transcription factor under glucose starvation conditions  <cit> . snf1p is also known or predicted to phosphorylate a wide range of substrates, including sip <dig>  <cit> , msn <dig>  <cit> , gat <dig> and gln <dig>  <cit> .

to further verify whether or not snf <dig> functions through a ptm-mediated way, we selected those expression experiments in which snf <dig> was up/down-regulated  <cit>  assuming that differential expression of snf <dig> would lead to expression changes of its downstream genes, thus snf <dig> could be inferred as the causal regulator. we compared the overlap significance between the degs of those data and the expected targets of snf <dig> in the six models. when ptm-mediated direct model was used, the overlaps between the observed degs and the expected targets of snf <dig> were highly significant , while the number of the overlap was  <dig>  when other models were used. this further supports that snf <dig> functions as a kinase. figure  <dig> shows possible regulatory mechanisms downstream of snf <dig> knockout and in mas <dig> promoter mutant experiments  <cit> . though the overlap of degs between these two conditions is low, gene expressions are affected through similar pathways. snf <dig> regulates gene expressions through its modification of hsf <dig>  msn <dig>  mig <dig>  sip <dig>  gat <dig> and gln <dig> in the mas <dig> promoter mutant experiment, while snf <dig> affects expressions through msn <dig>  mig <dig>  sip <dig> and gln <dig> in the knockout experiment. the low overlap may be due to the involvement of other tfs unrelated to snf <dig> 

possible regulatory pathways downstream of aft <dig> knockout
when simple direct model was used, the overlap p-value between the expected targets of aft <dig> and the observed degs under aft <dig> knockout was  <dig> , while the overlap p-value was  <dig> e- <dig> when ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation model  was used. figure  <dig> illustrates ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation pathway downstream of aft <dig> knockout. aft <dig> affects the expression of two protein kinases, tpk <dig> and kss <dig>  tpk <dig> modifies the protein states of msn <dig> and msn <dig>  while kss <dig> modifies the protein states of dig <dig> and ste <dig>  then these tfs lead to differential expressions of their target genes. tpk <dig> was differentially expressed in the aft <dig> knockout experiment, which supported the possibility of this regulatory pathway. the expression of kss <dig> was not changed, possibly due to the feedback regulation control of dig <dig>  ste <dig> and msn <dig> on kss <dig> 

to further verify whether or not aft <dig> functions through model iv under specific conditions, expression data with great down expression of aft <dig> were selected  <cit> . in the response to environmental changes under ypd stationary phase  <dig> d, aft <dig> showed  <dig>  fold change of down expression. we compared the degs under this condition with the expected targets in the six models of aft <dig>  the most significant overlap was also achieved at ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation model .

method verification by the overexpression of  <dig> tfs and deletion of  <dig> tfs
 <dig> actual perturbed tfs out of  <dig> tfs deletion experiments were correctly identified, while  <dig> perturbed tfs out of  <dig> tfs overexpression data were correctly identified. in comparison,  <dig> perturbed tfs out of  <dig> tfs deletion experiments and  <dig> out of  <dig> tfs overexpression ones were correctly inferred if only model i was used. hap <dig> and rox <dig> were correctly identified by model i but missed by our method in their knockout experiments. although the same p-values were obtained , hap <dig> ranked 4th if model i was used but ranked 22nd by our method. the dropped rank of hap <dig> may be partially due to the increased noise level introduced by considering more models in our method. additionally, considering no cooperative or competitive interactions between tfs may be another reason. in the hap <dig> knockout experiment, hap <dig> forming hap complex with hap <dig> ranked 1st, though hap <dig> itself ranked 22nd. if such cooperative interaction between hap <dig> and hap <dig> was integrated into the method, hap <dig> would rank much higher. the situation was similar for rox <dig>  which ranked 4th if model i was used and ranked 29th by our method. our method correctly identified sok <dig> and sut <dig>  which were missed by model i in deletion experiments. our method also correctly identified six more perturbed tfs  from their corresponding overexpression experiments. the result showed that considering ptm and cascade regulation helped explain effects of tfs perturbation, especially effects of tfs overexpression. the results  of the deletion of  <dig> tfs and overexpression of  <dig> tfs are listed in additional file  <dig> 

with the exception of abf <dig>  hsf <dig>  met <dig> and rap <dig>  which appeared only in overexpression experiments, the remaining  <dig> tfs were performed with both overexpression and deletion experiments.  <dig> of  <dig> tfs  showed higher overlap significance between the direct targets of these tfs and the observed degs in overexpression experiments than those in deletion ones. this is partially due to the redundancy of tfs. for example, msn <dig> and msn <dig> are paralogous tfs with blastp e-value less than e- <dig>  swi <dig> and skn <dig> have paralogous tfs with blastp e-value less than e- <dig>  a subset of the homologous tfs bind to an overlapping group of targets, and thus it is not surprising that knocking out one of them has a small effect on the expression of its targets. in contrast to deletion, overexpression increases binding of tfs, and thus would activate most of their downstream targets.  <dig> out of  <dig> tfs in deletion experiments , and  <dig> out of  <dig> tfs in overexpression experiments showed more significant overlap between the degs and the expected targets in other models than in model i by  <dig> times. this may suggest that effects of tfs overexpression are more involved in indirect transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation than those of tfs deletion.

we also compared our results on deletion experiments from  <cit>  and those from  <cit> . simple direct model was responsible for the effects of two swi <dig> deletion experiments. for some tfs, however, different pathways were involved in the downstream of two deletion experiments of the same tf. for example, simple direct transcription explained the effects of pho <dig> deletion experiment provided by  <cit> , while ptm-mediated two-layer cascade regulation model was the most likely model for the effects of the pho <dig> deletion experiment provided by  <cit> . this may imply that indirect transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory pathways downstream of tfs are condition-dependent, even in the case of the same tf deletion.

it should be noted that despite our prediction rate was less than 50%, it was much higher than that by random guess. if we randomly selected  <dig> tfs from the  <dig> candidates as causal regulators, the prediction rate was 14% . it would be even much lower if the quite stringent standard we used about valid findings  was also required since only small number of tfs satisfied the standard. in comparison, the prediction rate of our method achieved 28%  on hu et al. data, 31%  on chua et al. deletion data and 44%  on chua et al. overexpression data.

possible regulatory pathways downstream of sut <dig> overexpression
when simple direct model was used, the overlap p-value between the expected downstream genes of sut <dig> and the observed degs under sut <dig> overexpression was  <dig> , while p-value was  <dig> e- <dig> when hybrid two-layer cascade regulation model  was used, and sut <dig> ranked 2nd as the causal regulator out of  <dig> tf candidates. figure  <dig> shows the possible regulatory pathway downstream of sut <dig> overexpression. the effects of sut <dig> overexpression are mediated by gln <dig>  msn <dig>  msn <dig> and hap <dig>  among them, activity of gln <dig> is mediated by the phosphatase sit <dig>  sit <dig>  msn <dig>  msn <dig> and hap <dig> are all direct targets of sut <dig>  down expression was also observed for hap <dig> when sut <dig> was overexpressed, which further supported this regulatory pathway of sut <dig> 

method applied to transcriptome profiling during a transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth
to demonstrate the utility of the method to identify activated tfs in real biological process, we applied the method on transcriptome profiling during a transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth  <cit> . we constructed a gold positive set as true activated tfs by selecting those tfs with two-fold or more differential expression from  <dig> candidates. the gold positive set consisted of  <dig> tfs.

our method identified  <dig> tfs with overlap p-value being equal to or less than  <dig> . among  <dig> tfs,  <dig> tfs were true positives , expression of  <dig> tfs were changed less than two-fold , mal <dig> and mata <dig> were not profiled by the microarray.  <dig> tfs of the gold positive set were not detected by our method . in comparison, only  <dig> tfs with overlap significance p-value being equal to or less than  <dig>  were inferred if only simple direct model was used. among them,  <dig> tfs were two-fold or more differentially regulated ,  <dig> tfs were less than two-fold differentially expressed .  <dig> tfs of the gold positive set were missed . we compared the jaccard similarity score of our results with that obtained from simple direct model . the jaccard similarity score was defined as tp/  <cit> . the higher the jaccard similarity score, the better the method performs. the result showed that although our method got higher false positives, it achieved higher jaccard similarity score than that from model i, suggesting that taking multilayer-wise regulation models and ptm information into consideration was helpful for identifying activated tfs in the biological process.

the high false positives of our method may be due to the incomplete selection of positive set, where only those tfs with differential mrna expression were chosen. this standard would miss those activated tfs with changed protein status . among the top  <dig> causal regulators identified by our method ,  <dig> regulators could not be inferred if only simple direct model was used .  <dig> of  <dig> regulators  were differentially expressed, which suggested the possibility of their activity changes in the process. the remaining  <dig> regulators were treated as false positives. however, the involvement of these  <dig> regulators in the diauxic shift is known or can be inferred by literature. for example, snf <dig> and ssn <dig> are both important regulators involved in the diauxic shift  <cit> . the snf <dig> protein kinase controls the induction of genes of the iron uptake pathway at the diauxic shift  <cit> . in glucose-grown cells, ssn <dig> negatively regulates  <dig> genes, including  <dig> that are induced during the diauxic shift  <cit> . moreover, ssn <dig> protein levels are depleted during the diauxic shift  <cit>  and ssn <dig> is also required for phosphorylation of sip <dig> during growth in nonfermentable carbon sources  <cit> . as another example, pho <dig> is an in vivo substrate of pho <dig>  one of the yeast nutrient-sensing kinases involved in the changes in gene expression profiles when yeast cells undergo a diauxic shift  <cit> . additionally, pho <dig> functions to repress or down-regulate the transcription of snz <dig>  which is expressed specifically in the postdiauxic to stationary phase  <cit> . in another example, cbf <dig> dna binding is necessary for repression of pho <dig> basal expression at the diauxic shift  <cit> . it has been reported that carbon deprivation caused the nuclear localization of yap <dig>  <cit>  and the proportion of cells with the nuclear yap <dig> concentrated during the diauxic shift  <cit> , which suggests that yap <dig> is involved in the process. put <dig> is also predicted to be involved in the process  <cit> . these regulators are possibly true positives and are activated in the process via changes of protein status.

rox <dig> and sut <dig> ranked 6th and 4th, respectively, which were both differentially expressed. sut <dig> was the target of rox <dig>  and sut <dig> affected the expression of genes through hybrid two-layer cascade regulation model . this was consistent with the pathway of sut <dig> illustrated in figure  <dig>  where the perturbation of sut <dig> was mediated by gln <dig>  msn <dig>  msn <dig> and hap <dig>  sit <dig> , msn <dig> and hap <dig> were differentially expressed in the transition process, which further supported the possibility of the regulatory pathway of sut <dig>

results on the expression profiles in the transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth.
having demonstrated that our method identified those activated tfs with differential expression, we tested whether our method could find activated tfs that were both differentially expressed and post-translationally modified. we applied our method to infer activated tfs for mrna profiling data sets for yeast responding to the mating pheromone factor   <cit> .those identified tfs were evaluated by the transcriptional data and phosphoproteomics data after treatment with  <dig> mm α-factor for  <dig> min  <cit> . although the treatment concentrations were different between these two datasets, there was evidence that the transcriptional response to α-factor saturated at concentrations above  <dig>  nm  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our work provides an initial step toward analyzing gene expression data to find causal regulators by integrating tf-dna interactions and ptm information. we tested our method on large-scale tf deletion and overexpression experiments. the method correctly identified more actual perturbed tfs than the approach using only direct transcription, suggesting that indirect transcription and post-translation regulation are also responsible for tfs’ deletion/overexpression effects, especially for tfs’ overexpression effects. our method successfully identified known causal regulators and also inferred some novel tfs, which could lead to new hypotheses for future experiments during the processes of a transition from fermentative to glycerol-based respiratory growth and pheromone response. furthermore, possible regulatory pathways downstream of tfs in these processes were presented. expression and phosphorylation states of genes/proteins in the regulatory pathways provided further evidence to support the validity of these pathways.

although our method was developed to find causal tfs, it could be easily extended to discover causal signal molecules and kinases. for example, cdc <dig> is a catalytic subunit of the main cell cycle cyclin-dependent kinase. if downstream gene set of cdc <dig> was constructed by ptm-mediated direct model, the number of the overlap between the observed degs  in pheromone response and expected targets of cdc <dig>  was  <dig> and the p-value was  <dig> e- <dig>  this suggests that cdc <dig> is involved in pheromone response, a finding that is supported by literature and consistent with experiments showing reduced phosphorylation of cdc <dig>  <cit> .

in future work, we can further improve the method in several ways: 1) it could be beneficial to integrate into the framework information of transcriptional complexes and cooperative and competitive interactions. for example, although gcr <dig> was not correctly identified, rap <dig> was identified with the 2nd rank  in gcr <dig> knockout experiment. it is known that the rap1/gcr <dig> regulatory complex is required for efficient transcription of ribosomal protein  and glycolytic genes  <cit> . if such information of the cooperative interaction between rap <dig> and gcr <dig> was integrated into the framework, gcr <dig> could be correctly identified as the causal regulator. 2) it could be helpful to integrate into the framework proteomics data. protein abundance together with protein post-translational modifications status could be used to calculate the probability of existence of pathways, and then evaluate the possibility of the regulator as the cause. 3) it may be helpful to add sign in the model to represent the regulatory effects , to enhance the preciseness of the framework. 4) our method would miss those tfs only responsible for small subset of degs because overlaps between downstream genes of those tfs and the whole set of degs would not be significant. constructing downstream genes of combination of tfs may be beneficial in these cases. 5) the performance of our method relies heavily the size and quality of tf-dna interactions and ptm information. however, all of the interactions, especially ptm information, are incomplete and variable in different cellular conditions. limited and inaccurate information could mislead to biased paths and causal regulators. more abundant and accurate data available in the future would improve the power of the method.
