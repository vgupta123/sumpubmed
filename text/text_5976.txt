BACKGROUND
plants respond to challenge from pathogens by activating an inducible protein-based defense system that includes  <dig> families of pathogenesis-related  proteins termed pr- <dig> to pr- <dig>  <cit> . proteins of the pr- <dig> family have high sequence identity with thaumatins, which are sweet-tasting proteins isolated from the west african shrub thaumatococcus daniellii and are thus referred to as thaumatin-like proteins   <cit> . for decades, tlps have been studied extensively in plants for their antifungal properties. the recent identification of tlps in animals  <cit>  and fungi  <cit>  indicates that these proteins are more widely distributed and not only restricted to plants  <cit> .

molecular studies of tlp expression, localisation and activity support a role for tlps in host defense during pathogen infection. tlp up-regulation has been described in many higher plants infected by pathogens such as bacteria, oomycetes and fungi  <cit> . localisation studies revealed that plant pathogen-inducible tlps are secreted into the apoplast  <cit> . more than  <dig> tlps from animals, fungi and plants have been shown to exhibit an antifungal activity  <cit> , although the mechanisms by which tlps exert this activity remain unclear. several antifungal modes of action have been described such as membrane permeabilization  <cit> , β-glucan binding and degradation  <cit> , inhibition of enzymes such as xylanases  <cit> , α-amylase, or trypsin  <cit> , as well as an apoptosis-inducing mechanism reported in yeast  <cit> . other functional properties have been reported for tlps, including antifreeze activity  <cit> , protection from abiotic stress  <cit>  and binding to proteins such as actin, viral cmv- <dig> protein, yeast glycoproteins and g-protein coupled receptor  or to hormones such as cytokinins  <cit> .

most typical tlps described to date have a molecular weight ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda, and generally possess  <dig> conserved cysteine residues that form eight disulfide bonds  <cit> . recently, small tlps  have been identified in monocots and conifers. these are characterized by a smaller molecular weight  and only  <dig> conserved cysteine residues that form five disulfide bonds  <cit> . seven tlp structures have been solved so far, revealing a strongly conserved 3d organisation with a characteristic acidic cleft domain that comprises the five highly conserved amino acids reddd that are dispersed in the primary sequence  <cit> . despite good conservation of these amino acids in stlp primary sequences, they do not organize into an acidic cleft at the 3d level  <cit> . unusual tlp and protein kinase fusion proteins referred to as pr5-kinase or tlp-kinase  have also been reported in a few plant species  <cit> .

the analysis of the populus trichocarpa 'nisqually-1' genome revealed a substantial over-representation of genes encoding disease resistance proteins compared with annual species such as arabidopsis thaliana, and this increase is not solely attributable to the genome expansion in populus  <cit> . in particular,  <dig> putative tlp genes were initially identified in p. trichocarpa versus  <dig> for a. thaliana  <cit> . populus spp. are economically important and hybrid poplars in particular are used extensively worldwide for wood production. breeding programs particularly target resistance to melampsora spp. fungi, which are responsible for leaf rust, a major disease of poplars that severely impacts tree growth and wood production  <cit> . with the availability of both p. trichocarpa and m. larici-populina genome sequences, the biotrophic poplar-rust interaction is emerging as a model pathosystem in forest biology  <cit> . several transcriptome-based studies revealed transcriptional reprogramming in poplar leaves infected by melampsora spp., including the up-regulation of many pr proteins  <cit> . in particular, transcript profiling of poplar leaves during an incompatible interaction  with m. larici-populina established a set of host-defense marker genes, including several tlps  <cit> .

the present study describes the annotation of  <dig> tlp gene models in the p. trichocarpa 'nisqually-1' genome version  <dig> . in addition, comparison of expression studies conducted on poplar subjected to biotic  and abiotic stresses identified stress-responsive clades. the comparison of  <dig> complete eukaryote tlp amino acid sequences, of which  <dig> come from the  <dig> plant genome sequences currently available, allowed us to establish a link between function and phylogeny by systematically mapping functional data mined from the literature to the phylogenetic tree. in silico structural analysis confirmed that, with the exception of stlps, the acidic cleft domain is strongly conserved among eukaryote tlps.

RESULTS
annotation, phylogeny, genomic distribution and gene expression of poplar tlps
in contrast to tuskan and collaborators  <cit> , we identified a total of  <dig> putative tlp genes in the p. trichocarpa 'nisqually-1' genome version  <dig> . in version  <dig>  of the genome, now integrated in the phytozome portal  <cit> ,  <dig> of these tlp gene models are not validated. these  <dig> invalidated models include  <dig> predicted alleles that were previously considered to be independent genes and six probable pseudogenes that are interrupted by stop codons . the remaining  <dig> tlp genes that are validated in version  <dig>  of the genome comprise  <dig> typical tlps and four genes with strong homology to tlp-k from a. thaliana, including fusion to a putative protein kinase  .

a phylogenetic tree constructed with the validated poplar tlps reveals four well-defined clades, numbered here from  <dig> to  <dig>  among these clades, the reddd residues are highly conserved with only small variations for five tlps . the size of the proteins varies from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  for the  <dig> typical tlps and is approximately  <dig> amino acids  for the four tlp-ks. the predicted isoelectric points vary from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and correspond well with the tlp phylogeny . analysis of the protein domain organisation showed that the thaumatin domain  covers almost 95% of the entire mature tlps, except  <dig> tlps in clades  <dig> and  <dig> that have approximately  <dig> additional amino acids in their c-terminal region. the four tlp-ks are grouped in a specific branch of clade  <dig>  suggesting that they are monophyletic in poplar. the gene structure of poplar tlps is well conserved within clades 1- <dig>  with genes belonging to clade  <dig> formed by a single exon, tlps from clade  <dig> by two exons and tlps of clade  <dig> by three exons ; clade  <dig> is an exception with genes composed of one, two or three exons.

the version  <dig>  of the p. trichocarpa genome incorporates a greatly improved physical map compared with version  <dig> . this helped localise  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated tlp genes on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes  . scaffold  <dig> contains  <dig> tlp genes, including all  <dig> tlp genes from clade  <dig> which are located within a  <dig> kb segment that encodes tlps exclusively. we named this region the tlp cluster. transposable elements  cover 52% of this  <dig> kb region, with a particular over-representation of long terminal repeat  gypsy elements that cover 37% of the cluster .

results compiled from three different previously published transcriptome analyses of poplar leaves infected by melampsora spp. fungi  <cit>  indicate that, of the  <dig> tlp genes,  <dig> are significantly up-regulated and two are significantly down-regulated . among the  <dig> up-regulated tlp transcripts,  <dig> belong to clades  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> of these are located on scaffold  <dig> . interestingly, five tlp genes are up-regulated during an incompatible poplar/rust interaction, of which three are grouped in clade  <dig>  under abiotic stress conditions, five poplar tlp transcripts showed differential accumulation. in addition, six tlps were identified by different proteomic studies, of which four were shown to accumulate during biotic or abiotic stress . more specifically, the poptlp <dig> gene  from clade  <dig> is associated with several biotic and abiotic stresses and we confirmed with a detailed time-course analysis by rt-qpcr that poptlp <dig> expression increases in poplar leaves challenged by m. larici-populina .

tlps in green plant genome sequences
we performed an exhaustive genomic analysis of plant tlps by collecting tlp gene models from  <dig> sequenced plants available at the phytozome portal  <cit> . models encoding proteins with an incomplete thaumatin domain were ignored . a single but incomplete tlp gene was identified in the unicellular green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which represents the evolutionary starting point of viridiplantae, and thus makes the origin of complete tlps in the green lineage unclear . three complete tlp genes were identified in the moss physcomitrella patens and  <dig> were found in the vascular plant selaginella moellendorffii, indicating that an important gene expansion occurred in the transition from bryophytes to tracheophytes. among the  <dig> angiosperm genomes, the tlp gene number varies from  <dig> in the barrel clover medicago truncatula to  <dig> in the black cottonwood p. trichocarpa, whereas a. thaliana has  <dig> tlp genes. an average of  <dig> tlp genes are present in angiosperms, with similar numbers of tlps in dicots or monocots . stlp-encoding genes were identified exclusively in monocots , whereas tlp-ks have been identified in both monocots and dicots, although dicot tlp-ks were restricted to the a. thaliana and p. trichocarpa genomes. to identify the genes that are most similar to tlp-ks in the remaining dicots, we performed homology searches with the kinase domain of tlp-ks and retrieved only lectin-kinase genes, confirming the absence of tlp-ks in these dicot genomes . in s. bicolor, a small-tlp-kinase  composed of a n-terminal stlp domain and a c-terminal protein kinase domain, separated by a predicted transmembrane  domain, was identified . the origin of this arrangement is puzzling and has apparently evolved independently of tlp-ks. to our knowledge, this is the first report of such a domain organisation.

eukaryote tlps: linking phylogeny with protein structure and function
to achieve an accurate and complete phylogeny of eukaryote tlps, we retrieved an additional  <dig> sequences with a complete thaumatin domain from the ncbi protein database  <cit>  and combined them with the  <dig> plant sequences that we identified earlier . these include several sequences from fungi  and invertebrate animals , as well as other plants from mainly the asterid and conifer divisions. we report for the first time the identification of stlp genes in basidiomycetes, precisely in the pucciniales m. larici-populina and puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici. fungal stlps appear to be monophyletic, suggesting that stlps evolved independently in pucciniales, monocots and conifers or that stlps were lost during evolution from other phyla such as dicots and animals . overall, a total of  <dig> sequences were retrieved from  <dig> different species  and were used for comparative genomic analyses. the phylogeny of these eukaryote tlps reveals three major monophyletic groups . tlp subgroup i consists of  <dig> sequences and includes highly specific clades, such as a fungal clade containing tlps from both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, as well as plant clades that are specific to conifers, monocots, monocot stlps, monocot tlp-ks, dicots or asterids. tlp subgroup ii is composed of  <dig> sequences and includes an animal-specific clade with distinct sub-clades for nematodes and arthropods. because of their over-representation, a large clade of plant sequences constitutes the vast majority of tlp subgroup ii, with several subclades composed of relatively balanced numbers of monocot and dicot sequences . tlp subgroup ii notably includes a clade enriched in rosid and tree tlps that in particular contains the poplar tlp cluster. dicot tlp-ks also belong to tlp subgroup ii. tlp subgroup iii contains only  <dig> sequences from  <dig> different plant species, with a large number of sequences from the vascular plant s. moellendorffii .

an alignment with  <dig> representative tlp sequences from the major sub-clades shows the diversity of eukaryote tlps . the thaumatin domain of ascomycetes is almost 30% longer than that of typical tlps , mainly due to three insertions in less-conserved regions of the domain. by contrast, stlps are almost 30% smaller than typical tlps  due to a large deletion. the  <dig> cysteine residues  are extremely well conserved, except for 1- <dig> residues in ascomycete and basidiomycete stlps and in some animal sequences . the reddd motif or its equivalent  is fully conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> representative sequences. similarly, the amino acids forming the bottom of the acidic cleft and those at each extremity of the thaumatin domain are generally well conserved.

information about the biological and/or biochemical properties were compiled for  <dig> tlps with a complete amino acid sequence from an exhaustive survey of the literature . these data were added systematically to the phylogenetic sub-trees of tlp subgroups i  and ii . among these  <dig> tlps,  <dig> have antifungal activity and nine have endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity. surprisingly, antifungal tlps are widespread among eukaryotes, as  <dig> are present in tlp subgroup i and  <dig> are in tlp subgroup ii. a similar widespread assortment across tlp subgroups i and ii was obtained for tlps that exhibit endo-β- <dig> -glucanase or antifreeze activities. compared with the large amount of information available concerning asterid tlps , there is almost no functional characterization of conifer and fungal tlps or stlps. one exception is tlx <dig>  a stlp from wheat , which is the only stlp characterized to date and the only tlp shown to have xylanase inhibitor activity . among poplar tlps, only the four tlps from the poplar clade  <dig>  belong to the eukaryote tlp subgroup i . proteins from tlp subgroup ii have been poorly characterized, except for the rosid-specific and tree-enriched clade, which contains several proteins with described antifungal or endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activities . thirty-one poplar tlps are distributed in tlp subgroup ii, including the  <dig> tlps that form the poplar tlp cluster and which are assembled in the tree-enriched clade. to our knowledge, none of the proteins from subgroup iii have been characterized at the functional level so far .

to estimate how tlp structural diversity influences biological and biochemical functions, a 3d structure alignment  was performed with the phylogenetically most distinct tlp structures available among the seven solved to date: the tobacco pr-5d  from tlp subgroup i and the cherry pru av  <dig>  from tlp subgroup ii . in general, the 3d structures of these tlps superimpose well, especially the region forming the acidic cleft. indeed, this region, as well as two hydrophobic or aromatic residues , are important for the antifungal or lytic activities of tlps . however, although well conserved, some residues of the reddd and ff motifs adopt slightly different positions in these two tlps. for example in the pru av  <dig> structure, the side chain of the aspartate at position  <dig>  is oriented outside the acidic cleft and the phenylalanine residue f <dig> is replaced by a small non-aromatic residue  that is positioned differently. it is not clear whether these small differences have a significant impact on the substrate selectivity or protein function. primary sequence alignment mapping on 3d structures  of pr-5d and pru av  <dig> with sequences from subgroups i and ii, respectively, confirmed that the acidic cleft is the most conserved region among eukaryote tlps . by contrast, although the reddd amino acids are conserved in most stlps, am-3d of several stlp sequences with the recently solved structure of wheat tlx <dig>  revealed neither an acidic cleft nor any particular conserved region which could be linked to the reported xylanase inhibitor function .

alignment of the  <dig> tlp-ks identified from six different plant species , including the four poplar tlp-ks, revealed that the thaumatin domain of tlp-ks is similar to that of typical tlps, possessing both the conserved residues involved in the acidic cleft and the cysteine residues . the protein kinase domain of tlp-ks is extremely well conserved, even among monocots and dicots, and contains two fully conserved residues d <dig> and d <dig> known to be part of the catalytic motif  <cit> . a predicted tm domain is present between the thaumatin and the protein kinase domains in all tlp-k sequences , except bradi-2g <dig>  which might be due to an erroneous interdomain annotation in the brachypodium distachyon genome.

discussion
the recent release of the p. trichocarpa genome, the first tree genome available, paved the way for high-throughput genomic and computational analyses of multigene families, and has defined populus as a model organism in forest biology  <cit> . considering that leaf rust fungi are responsible for considerable damage in poplar plantations, the populus/melampsora interaction has emerged as a model pathosystem in forest pathology  <cit> . in order to decipher the molecular basis of poplar resistance against this biotrophic fungus, in-depth and exhaustive studies of defense-related functions require a reliable annotation of gene families before we can understand their structural and functional diversity. we have therefore performed a genome-wide analysis of the tlp multigene family, which comprises many stress-inducible proteins in p. trichocarpa. extension of the phylogenetic analysis to include tlps from other eukaryotes extends our knowledge about the evolution of tlps.

tlps in plant genomes: an evolutionary diversification
the history of tlp multigene families retraced from  <dig> plant genome sequences shows a strong evolutionary diversification from the green alga c. reinhardtii to the black cottonwood tree p. trichocarpa . in the co-evolution of host-microbe interactions, plants and fungi acquire new weapons that promote their resistance or virulence, respectively  <cit> . as a consequence of this arms race, the size of some multigene families involved in resistance  has greatly increased in poplar and other higher plants  <cit> . it is accepted that this increase, sometimes specific to certain organisms, represents an important means for generating functional diversity via sub- or neo-functionalization of paralogs  <cit> . analysis of natural selection is increasingly used in plant pathology to estimate how evolutionary forces impact genes and corresponding proteins, from the scale of amino acid sites to gene families  <cit> . poplar tlp genes have recently been investigated for natural selection. the four tlp-ks and  <dig> of the  <dig> tlps that belong to clade  <dig>  were shown to be driven by diversifying  selection . more precisely, several exposed amino acids of tlps are under diversifying selection, whereas amino acids forming the acidic cleft are under purifying  selection and thus well-conserved . conservation of the acidic cleft could be necessary to maintain antifungal activity, whereas diversification of exposed amino acids could avoid recognition by pathogen enzyme-inhibitors or proteases  <cit> .

is the antifungal activity of tlps a universal property?
historically, tlps have been described as biotic and abiotic stress-responsive proteins and were called tlps/pr <dig> or osmotin/osmotin-like proteins , depending on the stress condition  in which these proteins or their closest homologs were first described. as already suggested by shatters and collaborators  <cit> , phylogenetic analyses do not support this separate nomenclature that generates semantic confusion in the literature  <cit> . our broad sequence analysis of eukaryote tlps confirms that there is no clear difference among tlps and olps, since different tlp functions are not separated by distinct phylogenetic clades. in fact, the major biochemical properties of tlps such as antifungal or endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activity are widespread among eukaryotes . at the structural level, most tlps are predicted to share a conserved acidic cleft, which is usually associated with an antifungal property, suggesting that this property is universal among eukaryote tlps . although more subtle conformational differences might explain the large variety of properties described so far for tlps, the phylogenetic and functional data do not justify adoption of a distinct nomenclature between biotic- and abiotic-responsive tlps. an exception to this statement might be considered for tlps with different domain organisations such as stlps or tlp-ks. indeed, stlps are assumed to act as xylanase inhibitors and no antifungal activity has yet been reported  <cit> . this functional divergence is consistent with the important structural differences observed and in particular with the absence of a well-defined acidic cleft .

poplar tlps: stress-responsive proteins, but not only
the release of the p. trichocarpa genome version  <dig>  and its integration into the phytozome portal enabled a drastic improvement of tlp gene annotation and the validation of more than 70% of the  <dig> tlp gene models from the populus genome version  <dig>  [additional file  <dig>   <cit> ). the expression analysis of tlps during biotic and abiotic stresses supports the idea that tlps, like other pr proteins, belong to a general plant stress response pathway rather than being specific to distinct stresses, as often hypothesized  <cit> . this is exemplified by poptlp <dig>  whose expression is induced by diverse environmental constraints such as high ozone, uv-b, drought, copper and infection by rust fungi . in addition, poptlp <dig> is the closest homolog of a. thaliana atosm <dig> , which also accumulates during both biotic and abiotic stress conditions  <cit> . the rt-qpcr expression profile of poptlp <dig> in rust-infected poplar leaves confirmed transient transcript accumulation during host-specific resistance . this profile is in accordance with results obtained by similar approaches for several pr proteins in this pathosystem  <cit>  and confirms the involvement of tlps in poplar defense.

however, the fact that only  <dig> of the  <dig> poplar tlps are transcriptionally regulated in the stress conditions investigated suggests that their role in poplar might not be restricted to stress response but that they could have other roles, such as during development. indeed, some tlps have been reported to accumulate during plant developmental stages or conditions such as in ovular secretions or during leaf aging  <cit> . in addition, tlps have been extensively described as ripening-associated proteins that accumulate strongly in fruit during maturation  <cit> . it has been shown recently in hybrid poplars that two tlps belonging to the tree-specific and stress-responsive tlp cluster  are present in the phloem of healthy non-stressed plants  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the expansion of this multigene family in poplar could also be related to tree-specific developmental stages.

the poplar tlp cluster contains tree-specific and stress-responsive proteins
the poplar tlp cluster is an assembly of  <dig> successive genes on scaffold  <dig> and is considerably enriched in te for a gene-containing genomic region. indeed, te account for 52% of the tlp cluster region compared with an average coverage of 42% in the whole genome  <cit> . moreover, ltr te from the gypsy class are specifically over-represented, covering 37% of the tlp cluster compared with 5% in the whole p. trichocarpa genome sequence . this class of te might be a source of genome plasticity in plants  <cit> . the very well-conserved exon-intron structure of the genes in the tlp cluster supports a mechanism of tandem duplication from a unique ancestral gene . taken together, these results strongly suggest that this cluster likely resulted from recent tandem duplications driven by te activity. futhermore, the tlp cluster appears to be highly responsive to fungal infection in poplar and belongs to a rosid-specific and tree-enriched clade in our complete phylogeny of eukaryote tlps . tlps from cherry, chestnut, apple and peach trees that exhibit antifungal and/or endo-β- <dig> -glucanase activities  also belong to this clade. thus, the tlp cluster appears to be a tree-specific and rust-responsive group of tlps that are of outstanding interest for further analyses focusing on tree and tlp specificities in defense against pathogens. more precisely, two tlps recently identified at the protein level in the phloem of hybrid poplar constitute excellent candidates for future investigations .

tlp-ks: defense proteins recruited for signaling?
tlp-ks result from the fusion between two genes coding for a tlp and a protein kinase. they have been hypothesized to act as receptor-like kinases , where the extracellular tlp could sense pathogens and the cytoplasmic kinase could relay downstream signaling  <cit> . this assumption was strengthened by the demonstration that plants overexpressing an a. thaliana tlp-k showed a delay in the appearance of disease symptoms  <cit> . the ability of plants to recruit defense proteins to form a rlk involved in pathogen sensing has already been suggested for pr <dig> and pr <dig>  <cit> . the strong homology of the kinase domain between tlp-k and some lectin-kinases reinforces the speculation about the potential role of tlp-k in the induction of the defense system, since a rice lectin-kinase has been shown to confer resistance to the rice blast  <cit> . in the p. trichocarpa genome, three tlp-ks are organized in tandem on scaffold  <dig> and are interspersed by other protein kinase-encoding genes. this genomic region is referred to as the 'tlp-k cluster' . genetic and physical mapping of melampsora rust resistance genes in natural populations of p. trichocarpa identified a locus encoding two tlp-k genes on chromosome  <dig>  which possibly corresponds to the tlp-k cluster in scaffold  <dig> of the p. trichocarpa genome sequence  <cit> . hence, although evidence is still needed to clarify the exact role of these tlp-ks in poplar, this opens interesting perspectives concerning new rlk types related to poplar defense against melampsora spp. rust pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
tlps are eukaryote proteins that constitute small and monophyletic families in invertebrate animals and fungi whereas they are more diverse and are organized in large multigene families in plants. regardless of their origin, it appears that many typical tlps possess an antifungal activity, which is probably linked to a conserved acidic cleft in their 3d structure. in plants, tlps have undergone a drastic evolutionary diversification including the evolution of tree-enriched clades and of tlps fused to protein kinase domains. the poplar genome encodes  <dig> validated tlp gene models, including four tlp-kinases. some poplar tlp transcripts accumulate specifically under abiotic or biotic stress conditions, which can be strongly correlated with their phylogeny. in the poplar genome, a tree-specific and stress-responsive cluster of tandemly-duplicated tlp genes should be of interest for understanding the unique attributes of defense against pathogen attacks that have evolved in trees.
