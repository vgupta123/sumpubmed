BACKGROUND
isoprenoids are widely distributed in nature with multiple functions due to their structural diversity and represent an important resource for the biotechnology industry with uses ranging from aroma and flavor enhancers  to anticarcinogenic molecules   <cit> . all isoprenoids originate from isopentenyl pyrophosphate , containing five carbon units, which in most organisms is obtained through the mevalonate  pathway or the methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate  pathway, the latter of which occurs in plant plastids, algae and some bacteria  <cit> .

condensation between two acetyl-coa molecules to form acetoacetyl-coa has been recognized as the first step in the mevalonate pathway in eukaryotes  <cit> . this reaction is catalyzed through a non-decarboxylative claisen-type condensation by an enzyme that belongs to the thiolase protein family known as acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase   <cit> . the thiolase protein family comprises enzymes that have different subcellular localizations and expression patterns, depending on the pathway with which they are associated; in yeast, enzymes with cytoplasmic locations are mevalonate pathway related enzymes , and 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase , which is involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, is found in peroxisomal locations  <cit> .

the second step in mevalonate biosynthesis involves the addition of a third acetyl-coa molecule to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa  by the hmg-coa synthase  enzyme, followed by the conversion of hmg-coa to mevalonic acid via hmg-coa reductase , which is the most studied step of the mevalonate pathway and has been defined as the rate-limiting step in sterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes  <cit> . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, two hmgr encoding genes have been identified, hmg <dig> and hmg <dig>  with hmg <dig> contributing the majority of the enzymatic activity in the pathway  <cit> ; however, only one acat encoding gene  has been reported in this yeast  <cit> . the concluding steps in the mevalonate pathway include two sequential phosphorylation reactions performed by the enzymes mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase, respectively, and a final decarboxylation step catalyzed by phosphomevalonate decarboxylase to produce ipp  <cit> , which is the precursor of the wide variety of isoprenoid compounds and derivatives, including secondary metabolites of commercial value.

the basidiomycetous yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous has been extensively studied for its ability to produce large amounts of isoprenoids, primarily astaxanthin , a red carotenoid used as a feeding additive in aquaculture, making it appealing to the biotechnological industry. most genetic studies with this yeast have focused on the characterization of genes involved in carotenogenesis  <cit>  and genes involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids precursors  <cit> . it has been shown that astaxanthin production in x. dendrorhous is favored when cultures are supplemented with mevalonate  <cit>  or in strains that have higher hmgr transcript levels  <cit> . these results reflect the critical role of the mva pathway in carotenogenesis in x. dendrorhous, highlighting the importance of studying the mva pathway and identifying the genes that are directly involved in the synthesis of ipp.

regarding the erg <dig> gene of x. dendrorhous, a possible acat encoding gene was recently identified in a genomic study of this yeast  <cit> , and its overexpression in x. dendrorhous led to an increase in total carotenoid production  <cit> . in the present study, another possible x. dendrorhous thiolase-encoding gene is identified, and additional functional evidence for the previously reported acat encoding gene and for the newly characterized acaa encoding gene in this yeast is provided.


RESULTS
bioinformatic characterization and expression analysis
gene identification was accomplished by running a local blastp search in the program clc genomics workbench through the x. dendrorhous genomic and transcriptomic databases  <cit> , using related erg <dig> sequences obtained from the genbank database as queries. two potential erg <dig> sequences were obtained and designated erg10a and erg10b. the erg10a gene is composed of  <dig> introns and  <dig> exons, and its cdna has a length of  <dig>  bp encoding a deduced protein of  <dig> amino acids with a total size of  <dig>  kda, while the erg10b gene contains  <dig> introns and  <dig> exons, and its cdna has a length of  <dig>  bp encoding a  <dig> -kda deduced protein of  <dig> amino acids.

within the thiolase family, degradative and biosynthetic enzymes share the same catalytic mechanism in which the catalytic site is conformed by four loops, each carrying conserved residues at the active site  <cit> . these residues correspond to cys- <dig>  asn- <dig>  his- <dig> and cys- <dig> in the deduced thiolase encoded by the erg10a gene and cys- <dig>  asn- <dig>  his- <dig> and cys- <dig> in the thiolase deduced from erg10b. two reactions occur in the catalytic site of this enzyme family; first a conserved highly reactive cys residue  is acetylated, while a second cys  protonates the coa leaving group. the second reaction involves condensation, in which the negatively charged cys- <dig> deprotonates a second acetyl-coa, to which the acetyl moiety of cys- <dig> is transferred  <cit> . according to bioinformatic analyses, both putative x. dendrorhous thiolases contain all of the catalytic site amino acids, but no further information regarding their catalytic activity could be obtained.

to determine the possible function of the thiolase encoded by each gene, a phylogenetic tree was created using thiolase amino acid sequences described as having different functions: acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase or 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase. for multiple alignments, the program clustalw  <dig>  was used and a phylogenetic tree was built using the neighbor joining method with a  <dig> -replica bootstrap with mega <dig> software  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the thiolase encoded by the erg10a gene groups with acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferases, and the thiolase encoded by erg10b groups with 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolases. the multiple alignment used to generate this tree is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  where cys- <dig>  asn- <dig>  his- <dig> and cys- <dig> correspond to the conserved active site residues. this result suggests that erg10a most likely encodes the thiolase involved in the mevalonate pathway and that erg10b is the thiolase involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids in x. dendrorhous. moreover, the erg10a nucleotide sequence has a 98% identity with 91% coverage compared to the x. dendrorhous acat reported nucleotide sequence available at genbank   <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of erg10a and erg10b thiolases from x. dendrorhous compared to other organisms. the unrooted tree was created in mega  <dig>  using the neighbor-joining method  <cit>  with the following amino acid sequences. mitochondrial thiolase/acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase: b. taurus , h. sapiens , c. lupus familiaris , r. norvegicus , g. gallus . cytoplasmic thiolase/acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase: s. pombe , b. graminis f. sp. tritici  <dig> , s. cerevisiae , n. tabacum , z. mays , a. thaliana . mitochondrial thiolase/3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase: b. taurus , m. musculus , r. norvegicus . peroxisomal thiolase/3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase: s. cerevisiae , y. lipolytica , g. gallus , m. musculus , e. caballus , c. lupus familiaris . b. taurus , h. sapiens . x. dendrorhous : thiolase encoded by the erg10a gene. x. dendrorhous : thiolase encoded by the erg10b gene. accession numbers are given in parentheses. numbers at each node indicate the percentage support for a specific node after  <dig> -replica bootstrap analysis




to identify possible binding sites for transcriptional regulators, the promoter regions, which were considered to comprise  <dig>  bp upstream of the first atg codon of each gene, were analyzed using jaspar  and tbfind . several genes involved in the mva pathway of schizosaccharomyces pombe have been shown to be regulated by ergosterol levels through the sterol regulatory element binding protein , which has been described as a major regulator of genes related to the synthesis of cellular sterols  <cit> . in the promoter analysis, one possible sre element was identified upstream of each erg <dig> gene-encoding region, suggesting possible regulation through srebp. to gain further insight, the relative transcript levels of both genes were analyzed in a x. dendrorhous mutant strain ) that does not produce ergosterol but accumulates other sterols and demonstrates up-regulation of the hmgr gene involved in the mva pathway in relation to the wild type strain ucd 67– <dig>  <cit> . transcript levels for the erg10a and erg10b genes were evaluated in both strains after 24 h  and 120 h  of culture . at both time points, the transcript levels of erg10a were higher in the mutant strain in relation to the wild type strain. maximum differences were observed for the erg10a transcript levels after 120 h of culture . for erg10b, a significant change in transcript levels was observed only after 24 h. in the study made by loto et al. using the same strain and growth conditions  <cit> , transcripts for the hmgr gene were measured. the change in the expression of this gene was  <dig> times higher in the strain that doesn’t produce ergosterol compared to wild type strain. as the srebp pathway has been described as a regulatory mechanism that acts upon genes related to sterol biosynthesis  <cit> , the change could be attributed to a srebp-like mechanism. compared to these results, the change in expression of erg10a is minor and cannot be attributed to srebp a priori, although the gene contains potential sre sites in its promoter region. further experiments should be performed in the future to identify if there is a functional srebp-like mechanism in x. dendrorhous that may be regulating the aforementioned genes.fig.  <dig>

according to marcoleta et al.  <cit> , carotenogenesis in x. dendrorhous is repressed by glucose. moreover, the mig <dig> gene encoding the catabolic repressor mig <dig>  which mediates transcriptional glucose-dependent repression in other yeasts, was recently described and its mutation alleviated the glucose-mediated repression of carotenogenesis in x. dendrorhous  <cit> . considering these findings, the possible glucose-dependent regulation of erg10a and erg10b gene expression was studied to evaluate whether catabolite repression could act over pathways upstream of carotenogenesis. for this, the wild type x. dendrorhous strain was cultured in ym media without glucose supplementation until the stationary phase of growth was reached; then, the culture was divided into two flasks: one was supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml and the other was left as a control without glucose supplementation. cultures were incubated at 22 °c with constant agitation, and samples were taken after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h of treatment to extract total rna and evaluate erg10a and erg10b transcript levels by rt-qpcr . the erg10a gene transcript levels did not show any significant changes after the addition of glucose, but they were reduced approximately 5-fold compared to the control when glucose consumption began, which could be attributable to the by-products of glucose metabolism affecting erg10a expression. in contrast, erg10b transcript levels decreased approximately 120-fold when glucose was added to the culture compared to the untreated control, in a similar manner to the glucose repressed gene grg <dig> , used as a glucose repression control   <cit> . however, this decrease was only temporary as the transcript levels normalized to control levels when the glucose in the media was consumed. considering these results, only erg10b is repressed by glucose in a manner similar to catabolite repression. glucose repression, mediated by the transcription factors ume <dig>  abf <dig> and rp-a, has been reported previously for the s. cerevisiae gene pot1/fox <dig>  which encodes the yeast acaa thiolase  <cit> . this evidence also supports the notion that erg10b could indeed encode the acaa thiolase in x. dendrorhous.

the results presented above support the idea that erg10a encodes an acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase and erg10b encodes a 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase, each participating in a different metabolic pathway . thus, hereafter each gene denomination was assigned according to the gene name given in s. cerevisiae, erg <dig> to erg10a and pot <dig> to erg10b, and the sequences were uploaded to the genbank database .

functional complementation in s. cerevisiae
to functionally assess the bioinformatic results, we performed heterologous expression of each gene cdna in s. cerevisiae for complementation assays. for this analysis the s. cerevisiae diploid strain meyen ex e.c hansen ypl028w by <dig> , a heterozygous mutant for the erg <dig> gene, was acquired from the atcc collection.

the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> gene and the cdnas corresponding to the two potential x. dendrorhous thiolase-encoding genes  were inserted into the s. cerevisiae expression vector yepnp  and used to independently transform sc-erg10/erg <dig>  from each transformation, two random colonies were selected and analyzed by pcr to confirm the presence of the tested gene in the plasmid.table  <dig> strains and plasmids used in this work

acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase activity is essential for cell viability  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, this activity is only performed by the enzyme encoded by erg <dig>  so loss of this gene leads to unviable mutants. to assess if the gene expressed by the plasmid has the specified function, random spore analysis was performed. after sporulation of the transformant strains and asci breaking followed by haploid selection, total dna was extracted to confirm the lack of the endogenous erg <dig> gene and presence of the complementing gene in the plasmid by pcr analyses . these could only be confirmed in strains carrying the yepnp-10sc and yepnp-c10xd plasmids  that contain the erg <dig> genes from s. cerevisiae and x. dendrorhous, respectively. as shown in fig. 3a, the chromosomal erg <dig> gene from s. cerevisiae was amplified only from strains s288c and sc-derg <dig>  as haploid strains do not have this gene; instead, the band corresponding to the kanmx resistance gene was amplified from that locus . the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> gene could be fully detected in the control strain s288c, the diploid mutant strain sc-derg <dig> and strain sc-erg10sc, which carry the plasmid harboring this gene . a fragment of approximately  <dig>  bp was amplified from strain sc-cerg10xd, which corresponds to the cdna of gene erg <dig> from x. dendrorhous ; the same primer pair amplified a fragment of approximately  <dig>  bp when genomic dna from strain ucd 67– <dig> of x. dendrorhous was used as template, corresponding to the genomic version of erg <dig>  in the complementation assays with the x. dendrorhous pot <dig> gene, no haploid colonies lacking the endogenous erg <dig> gene could be identified, even though more than  <dig> colonies were analyzed by replica plating and  <dig> potential candidates were analyzed by pcr.fig.  <dig> pcr analyses of s. cerevisiae haploid strains. s. cerevisiae strains sc-erg10sc  and sc-cerg10xd  were analyzed by pcr to confirm the expected genotype. as controls, x. dendrorhous ucd 67– <dig> strain , s. cerevisiae strain s288c , s. cerevisiae diploid strain sc-erg10/erg <dig>  and a no-template control , were included. s. cerevisiae sc-erg10sc haploid strain  and s. cerevisiae sc-cerg10xd haploid strain  were analyzed to assess: a absence of chromosomal erg <dig> from s. cerevisiae ; b presence of geneticin resistance cassette in s. cerevisiae ; c presence of erg <dig> from s. cerevisiae ; and d presence of erg <dig> from x. dendrorhous . the molecular size markers lambda dna/hindiii  and generuler 1 kb plus  were used. on the right side of the picture, a schematic diagram of the amplification products is included; arrows represent primer sets with a letter indicating in which panel they were used. up and down  correspond to chromosomal regions located approximately 300 bp upstream and downstream of the s. cerevisiae erg <dig> gene, respectively, kanmx <dig> corresponds to the geneticin  resistance module, and pact <dig>  and ttdh <dig>  correspond to promoter and terminator regions in the vector yepnp, respectively




heterologous complementation in haploid strains was further analyzed by constructing growth curves  and performing total sterol quantification/composition analyses. samples for sterol extraction were recovered after 48 h of growth. the total amounts of sterols recovered from 10-ml samples were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for strain sc-erg10/erg <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>   for strain sc-erg10sc and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for strain sc-cerg10xd. differences in the amounts of sterols produced between the parental diploid strain and the complemented strains may be attributable to the fact that in the latter, the gene is carried in an expression plasmid from which transcription is not regulated, leading to higher transcription rates.

these results support the notion that erg <dig> indeed encodes the x. dendrorhous acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase as it complements the erg10- mutation in s. cerevisiae.

erg <dig> and pot <dig> gene mutations in x. dendrorhous
to gain further knowledge regarding the functions and effects on carotenogenesis of the potential thiolase-encoding genes identified in x. dendrorhous, deletion mutants were generated. plasmids ppht-erg10xd and ppht-pot1xd were constructed and linearized to independently transform the diploid wild type strain ucd 67– <dig> to replace the corresponding genes with a hygromycin b resistance cassette by homologous recombination. pcr analyses were performed to confirm the gene replacement events on the heterozygous mutant strains obtained for genes erg <dig> ) and pot <dig> ). to the naked eye, no pigmentation differences between both heterozygous mutant strains and the wild type could be appreciated. this observation was confirmed by pigment extraction and quantification from triplicate samples grown in liquid ym media at 22 °c for three days. the total amount of carotenoids extracted was 191 ± 5 μg/g dry weight for 385-erg10
 and 175 ± 8 μg/g dry weight for 385-pot1
 compared to 177 ± 11 μg/g dry weight from wild-type strain.

among the properties that differentiate acat from acaa encoding genes is the fact that acaa null mutants can be obtained  <cit> , whereas acat null mutants cannot unless there is more than one gene encoding enzymes with the same activity. we attempted to obtain x. dendrorhous double mutants for both strains using the double recombinant method . briefly, the method consists of growing a heterozygous mutant in liquid media with increasing concentrations of the antibiotic corresponding to the selection marker considering that strains that become homozygous  for the antibiotic marker would be able to grow at a higher concentration of the antibiotic than heterozygous strains. antibiotic concentration was increased until a phenotypic color difference in colonies grown in plates was observed. for 385-erg10
, antibiotic concentration could only be augmented from 15 μg/ml up to 100 μg/ml as higher concentrations inhibited cell growth; however, no differences in color phenotype were observed in the seeded colonies. growth of strain 385-pot1
 could still be accomplished at the maximum concentration of antibiotic used , and seeded colonies began to exhibit a paler phenotype when the antibiotic concentration in liquid media reached 200 μg/ml.

for both heterozygous mutant strain drm assays, a few colonies selected at the maximum possible antibiotic concentration were randomly chosen and analyzed by pcr to determine if both alleles of the studied genes were lost after the treatment. no homozygous mutants deriving from strain 385-erg10
 were found. although this is an expected result if erg <dig> encodes the thiolase involved in the mva pathway, a second approach was attempted to try to obtain a homozygous mutant. a second plasmid for transformation, ppzt-erg10xd, was constructed and used to transform 385-erg10
; transformant selection was performed using plates supplemented with zeocin and hygromycin b. no colonies resistant to both antibiotics were obtained after several attempts of transformation, suggesting that a homozygous mutant for gene erg <dig> may not be viable as expected considering that erg <dig> is an essential gene.

on the other hand, it was confirmed by pcr analyses that paler colonies deriving from strain 385-pot1
 after applying the drm had lost both pot <dig> alleles . for further analyses, only one of the analyzed colonies was used and designated 385-pot1
.

to compare phenotypic changes between 385-pot1
, 385-pot1
 mutants and the wild type strain, each was grown in ym media at 22 °c with constant agitation for four days in triplicate. samples were taken after 96 h of culture  to analyze carotenoid and sterol content and composition. within the growth curve, no significant differences were observed, either for total sterol or in carotenoid quantification. carotenoid samples were analyzed by rp-hplc and, as expected from visual inspection, strain 385-pot1
 showed major differences regarding carotenoid composition in relation to the parental and heterozygous mutant strains, with a reduced proportion of astaxanthin and an increase in carotenogenesis intermediaries . these results are similar to what has been previously observed in strains in which genes leading to sterol synthesis and carotenogenic pathways precursors were deleted to obtain heterozygous mutants  <cit> . in those mutants, decreases in the transcript levels of the genes crts and crtr, which control the synthesis of astaxanthin from beta-carotene, were reduced, which could partially explain their differential carotenoid compositions compared to the wild type strain. considering this background, total rna was extracted from each sample, and rt-qpcr analyses were performed to compare the relative amounts of transcripts of the genes erg <dig>  pot <dig>  crts and crtr . in the 385-pot1
 strain, only the pot <dig> transcript showed significant changes, demonstrating half the amount of transcript when compared to the parental strain ucd 67– <dig>  in the null 385-pot1
 mutant, pot <dig> transcripts were not detected, confirming that the strain does not have the functional gene. in this strain, the erg <dig> transcript level was increased 8-fold compared to the wild type, suggesting that some compensation for pot <dig> gene loss might be occurring. although acaa enzymes  are not directly related to the carotenogenic pathway, they might influence substrate availability as they catalyze the final steps in fatty acid β-oxidation, which could alter the acetyl-coa pool in the peroxisome that can be transported to the mitochondria for energy production through the tca cycle  <cit> . then, if no acetyl-coa is obtained from peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, more cytoplasmic acetyl-coa could be transported to the mitochondria; thus, a higher erg <dig> transcript level could help to ensure the cytoplasmic acetyl-coa flux towards the mva pathway to maintain the sterol production necessary for cell replication. although no significant changes were found in the crtr transcript level in the mutant 385-pot1
, the crts transcript level was reduced 5-fold, which could explain, at least in part, the differences observed in carotenoid composition. the crts gene encodes a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, and it has been shown that in x. dendrorhous, the crtr gene that encodes the cytochrome p <dig> reductase is essential for the synthesis of astaxanthin in this yeast  <cit> . then, considering that two cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are involved in ergosterol biosynthesis  <cit> , the reduced crts transcript levels could be related to reduced carotenogenic activity to maintain the flux towards ergosterol biosynthesis.table  <dig> total sterol and carotenoid content in x. dendrorhous pot <dig> mutant strains

erg <dig> and pot <dig> gene overexpression in x. dendrorhous
to evaluate if overexpression of the studied genes affects the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, strains that carry an extra copy of each gene were constructed. cdnas of genes erg <dig> and pot <dig> were inserted into the plasmid pxdvexp <dig>  <cit>  to obtain pxdvexp2-cerg10xd and pxdvexp2-cpot1xd, in which each cdna is located between the ubiquitin promoter and the gpd terminator from x. dendrorhous. these plasmids also bear a hygromycin b resistance module for transformant selection.

wild type strain ucd 67– <dig> was transformed using linearized plasmids to obtain the transformant strains 385-erg <dig> and 385-pot <dig>  in which the gene of interest was inserted by homologous recombination into a non-encoding single copy site named int  under control of the ubiquitin promoter  <cit> . a control strain resistant to hygromycin b , transformed with the empty plasmid, was also obtained. the correct insertion of each dna into the target locus was confirmed by pcr.

relative expression for each gene in the overexpression mutants was compared to control strain 385-vexp <dig> to determine if indeed there was an increase in transcript levels caused by the additional copy of each cdna. rt-qpcr was performed on samples taken after 120 h of growth in liquid ym-hygromycin b media to analyze transcript levels of genes erg <dig> and pot <dig>  for strain 385-erg <dig>  a  <dig> -fold erg <dig> transcript level increment was observed without any significant changes in the levels of pot <dig> transcripts. on the other hand, in strain 385-pot <dig>  a  <dig> -fold increase in pot <dig> transcript levels as well as no significant changes in erg <dig> transcripts in relation to the control strain was observed. these results confirm that the integration locus is appropriate for inserting additional gene copies for overexpression.

total carotenoids and sterols were extracted from these strains to determine if gene overexpression had any phenotypic effects, as no differences could be observed to the naked eye. as shown in table  <dig>  the total amounts of carotenoids and sterols among these strains indeed did not demonstrate any significant differences. previously, it was reported that erg <dig>  overexpression by integration in the rdna using the gdh  promoter led to a slight augmentation in the intracellular astaxanthin content produced by x. dendrorhous   <cit> . the observed differences in this study may be attributable to several differences in the experimental strategy, including the use of a different integration locus  <cit>  and promoter to regulate gene expression  <cit> , gene copy number and the different genetic background of the strain used as the host for gene overexpression.table  <dig> total sterol and carotenoid contents in x. dendrorhous thiolase overexpression strains

our results indicate that the overexpression of either the erg <dig> or pot <dig> genes does not lead to significant changes in the amount or composition of carotenoids and sterols in x. dendrorhous.

CONCLUSIONS
the x. dendrorhous erg <dig> gene encodes a functional acetyl-coa c-acetyltransferase  that acts in the first step towards mevalonate production, which was supported by a heterologous complementation assay in s. cerevisiae. the provided results suggest this gene may be regulated at a transcriptional level through an ergosterol-dependent mechanism. this observation corresponds with previous observations suggesting the possibility of a feedback regulatory mechanism mediated by ergosterol that regulates synthesis of sterols and carotenoids.

a second thiolase-encoding gene  was identified, and its potential involvement in carotenogenesis was tested by constructing x. dendrorhous mutants. according to the results, this second gene is not essential for the viability of the yeast and most likely encodes the x. dendrorhous 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase, which is important for supplying acetyl-coa for yeast metabolism through β-oxidation of fatty acids. this study provides the first functional evidence that by altering the acetyl-coa flux in different pathways and cell compartments, the overall synthesis of carotenoids in x. dendrorhous is affected.
