BACKGROUND
improvement of grapevine rootstocks and scion varieties can be achieved through either inter-specific hybridization or clonal selection. grapevine clonal selection consists in choosing in a variety one plant presenting desired characteristics. this selected plant is further propagated by vegetative multiplication known to maintain trueness-to-type. but clonal selection is restricted to the natural variability of a given cultivar, within the limits of the characteristics on which the trueness-to-type is based. somatic embryogenesis could be an additional possibility for varietal improvement. a broader perspective of improvement of grapevine cultivars for characteristics such as resistance to pests and diseases has been opened by transgenic technologies which in most cases are based on somatic embryogenesis of grapevine  <cit>  and shoot organogenesis  <cit> . one question to be addressed is the phenotypic and genotypic variability of grapevine clones raised through somatic embryogenesis or shoot organogenesis. recently, desperriers et al.  <cit>  presented results of a ten years observation of vitis vinifera gamay somaclones which showed variations in fertility as well as sugar content, size and level of maturity of the grapes. these observations illustrate that somaclones can differ from the original parent without changing the fundamental typicity of the wine. one possible origin of variability may be the separation of cell layers of the mother plant from which clones are grown.

the grapevine meristem is considered to be composed at least of two distinct cell layers l <dig> and l <dig>  <cit> , which can produce a chimeric tissue structure. for example, vitis vinifera cv. pinot meunier phenotype is due to the interaction of genetically distinct cell layers. when the cell layers of pinot meunier periclinal chimera were separated by passage through somatic embryogenesis, regenerated plants showed distinct dna profiles which proved to be different from that of the parent plant. regenerated somaclones also showed a novel phenotype  <cit> .

about five hundred microsatellite markers of the grapevine genome are now available and widely as well as very efficiently used for identification of cultivars  <cit> . riaz et al.  <cit>  used microsatellite markers for the detection of reproducible intra-cultivar polymorphism in vitis vinifera chardonnay and pinot noir. furthermore, some of these microsatellite markers made it possible to differentiate the two cell layers l <dig> and l <dig> in some clones of both cultivars  <cit> .

a previous paper  <cit> , showed that in the leaf tissue of chardonnay  <dig> the microsatellite marker vmc 5g <dig> revealed two standard alleles  and a variant allele  previously defined by riaz et al.  <cit> . wood tissues and roots only presented the two standard alleles with vmc 5g <dig>  with a second microsatellite marker , two standard alleles  and a mutant allele  were detected in leaves. this mutant allele replaced one of the standard alleles in woods and roots . in addition, we showed, that somaclones regenerated from anthers of a single inflorescence all derived from l <dig> cells exclusively.

in the present paper we report results of a wider genotypic analysis of somaclones regenerated either from anthers of different inflorescences or from nodal explants of chardonnay  <dig>  the same microsatellite markers were also used to compare the genotype of different clones obtained through shoot organogenesis. the genotypic identities  of the regenerated clones are in accordance with their respective phenotypic characteristics.

RESULTS
genotypic analysis of various tissues of chardonnay  <dig> mother clone
three alleles were detected in leaves of chardonnay  <dig> mother clone with the microsatellite marker vmc 6c10: the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp standard alleles and an additional  <dig> bp variant allele . the standard alleles were defined by riaz et al.  <cit>  as the most frequently detected alleles in different clones of the same cultivar. vmc 5g <dig> revealed in leaves the two  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp standard alleles and a  <dig> bp variant allele . the same genotype was observed with leaves from in vitro or greenhouse-grown plants. in the dna extracted from rootlets and wood tissues, only the two pairs of alleles 114: <dig> and 198: <dig> were detected with vmc 6c <dig> and vmc 5g <dig> respectively . in berry skin, the triallelic profiles were detected with both markers. it is known that wood and roots are composed of l <dig> cells only and that leaves comprise l <dig> and l <dig> cell layers. our results lead to the conclusion that the vmc 6c <dig>  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp alleles as well as the vmc 5g <dig>  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp alleles are present in l <dig> cells of chardonnay  <dig>  we can also deduce that l <dig> cells have the vmc 6c <dig>  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp alleles and the vmc 5g <dig> the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp alleles.

regeneration of plants through somatic embryogenesis or shoot organogenesis
four different inflorescences of chardonnay  <dig> were used to collect anthers. primary somatic embryos were obtained from anther-derived embryogenic calli after a  <dig> month period . secondary embryos were obtained  <dig> month after initiation of embryogenic calli from primary embryos. embryogenic calli and primary embryos from nodal explants were obtained after 2– <dig> months . meristematic bulks developed after successive transfers of shoots on im medium with benzyladenine concentrations increasing up to  <dig>  μm. high numbers of adventitious shoots regenerated from slices cut from the meristematic bulk tissues, and rooted plantlets further developed .

efficient plant growth was further obtained with a number of somaclones. the plants did not show any atypical phenotype in visual comparison with vegetatively propagated chardonnay  <dig> grown in the growth chamber and the greenhouse. except one somaclone  originated from an anther-derived callus.

genotypic analysis of chardonnay  <dig> somaclones obtained from anthers and from nodal explants
the same genotypic profiles were obtained with a total of  <dig> primary and  <dig> secondary somaclones regenerated from anthers collected from  <dig> different inflorescences and  <dig> clones from nodal explants . in leaves from in vitro and greenhouse-grown plants, the standard genotype  was visualised with vmc 6c <dig>  for vmc 5g <dig> in addition to the standard  <dig> bp allele, the  <dig> bp variant allele was detected in leaves from all somaclones . in the rootlets, the standard diallelic genotype was visualised with vmc 6c <dig>  with vmc 5g <dig> the  <dig> bp standard allele and the  <dig> bp variant allele were detected . these results show that all somaclones regenerated from l <dig> cells of the chardonnay  <dig> explants.

phenotypic and genotypic analysis of somaclone n°21
compared to the chardonnay  <dig> mother clone, which presents mature circular leaves undivided or with five lobes, all leaves from somaclone n°  <dig> show one circular undivided half and the other half with separated lobes . this phenotype was observed after the acclimatization and is still observed after  <dig> years on greenhouse-grown plants only for this somaclone.

in leaves from in vitro and greenhouse-grown somaclone  <dig>  the triallelic profile was detected with vmc 6c <dig>  for vmc 5g <dig> in addition to the standard  <dig> bp allele, the  <dig> bp variant allele was detected. the same results were obtained with berry skin. in the rootlets, the standard allele  and the mutant allele  were visualised with vmc 6c <dig> and with vmc 5g <dig> the standard allele  and the mutant allele  were detected . these results indicate that the genotype of somaclone  <dig> is the same as that of the mother clone for vmc 6c <dig>  but for vmc 5g <dig> only  <dig> alleles present in the l <dig> cell layer of the mother plant are present. a mutation in the microsatellite sequence vmc 6c <dig> from the l <dig> cell type of the mother clone probably occurred during embryogenesis of clone  <dig> 

genotypic analysis of clones obtained through shoot organogenesis
leaves from all  <dig> clones obtained through shoot organogenesis show the triallelic profile both for vmc 6c <dig> and vmc 5g <dig> . this suggests that plants obtained via organogenesis through meristematic bulks are derived from both l <dig> and l <dig> cell layers of the chardonnay  <dig> tissues from which they grew.

discussion
vitis vinifera chardonnay clone  <dig> is a periclinal chimera
in grapevine, apical meristems are composed of two or more cell layers forming the tunica in addition to a corpus  <cit> . in the leaf tissue from chardonnay  <dig>  which is derived from both the outer tunica layer l <dig> and the inner cell layer l <dig>  the microsatellite marker vmc 5g <dig> revealed the two standard alleles and a variant allele previously defined by riaz et al.  <cit> . wood tissues and roots, which originate exclusively from the l <dig> layer, presented only the two standard alleles. the presence of a third allele in leaf suggests that chardonnay is a periclinal chimera in which a mutant allele is present only in the l <dig> layer, as described by riaz et al.  <cit> . for the microsatellite marker vmc 6g <dig>  a mutant allele was detected in leaves, wood tissue and roots. this mutant allele replaced one of the standard alleles in woods and roots, whereas in leaves the mutant allele was present simultaneously with the two standard alleles  <cit> . these results suggest that the  <dig> bp-mutation resulting in the replacement of the vmc 6c <dig>  <dig> bp allele by the  <dig> bp allele only occurred in l <dig>  riaz et al.  <cit>  propose that the mutation most likely occurred in an l <dig> or l <dig> cell and then came to populate both layers of the meristem rather than two identical mutations appearing independently in the l <dig> and l <dig>  results reported by riaz et al.  <cit>  were based on visual interpretation of electrophoretic profiles of amplification products. we suggest that such observations could be biased by the dna polymerase slippage. our analyses with abi prism allowed to differentiate between an allele and the different stutter bands, without ambiguity.

somaclones develope only from l <dig> cells of chardonnay 96
in the present study, we show that somaclones obtained not only from anthers from different inflorescences but also from nodal explants all derived from l <dig> cells. embryogenic calli were composed exclusively of cells showing the genetic profile of l <dig> cells of the mother clone chardonnay  <dig> , suggesting that l <dig> cells could not multiply into callus at least in our culture conditions. on another hand, clones raised through shoot organogenesis are composed of cells showing the genetic profiles of both l <dig> and l <dig> cells of the mother clone. these observations suggest that the genetic chimerism of chardonnay  <dig> is maintained through shoot organogenesis but not through somatic embryogenesis.

anthers are the most widely used organ for initiation of grapevine somatic embryos. it has been shown that embryogenic cells derive from the anther filament. both l <dig> and l <dig> cell layers seem to be competent to form embryogenic calli in some conditions, as reported for pinot meunier by franks et al.  <cit> . filaments from anthers of chardonnay  <dig> are composed of l <dig> and l <dig> cells . but, in our conditions only l <dig> cells of chardonnay  <dig> developed into embryos. a similar result was reported recently with pinot gris from which only the l <dig> cell layer is competent to form embryogenic callus  <cit> .

phenotype variation of chardonnay  <dig> somaclones
embryogenesis might generate new grapevine phenotypes when the mother plant is a chimera of genetically distinct cell layers. for example, the separation of chimeric cell layers of pinot meunier through somatic embryogenesis generated plants that had distinct dna profiles and had novel phenotypes which were different from those of the parent plants  <cit> . the phenotype of all the somaclones we obtained from anthers has been observed for 2– <dig> years in a glasshouse: no visible modification was noticed  in comparison to the mother clone chardonnay  <dig>  this phenotypic conformity suggests that the l <dig> genotype would not significantly participate in the phenotypic expression in the l1–l <dig> chimeric chardonnay  <dig>  more subtle variations in fruit setting and wine quality may be only detected in the future, when the somaclones will be grown in the vineyard. variation of colour intensity, sugar content, size and level of maturity of the grapes has been reported for adult somaclones of gamay after ten years observation  <cit> . though no genotypic analyses were done for the different gamay somaclones, it can be hypothesised that this somaclonal variation is of epigenetic origin  <cit> . the chardonnay  <dig> mother clone shows the typical ampelographic traits of the cultivar chardonnay with mature circular leaves undivided or with five lobes, petiolar sinus slightly open, often limited through veins at petiole end. some adult leaves of somaclone  <dig> have an asymmetric shape, one half undivided or slightly lobed, the other half deeply lobed. somaclone  <dig> probably arose from l <dig> cell of chardonnay  <dig> as all the other somaclones. we suggest that during an early cell division a mutation occurred in locus 6c <dig> which replaced the  <dig> bp allele by a  <dig> bp allele. the l <dig> cell layer of somaclone  <dig> originated from the diallelic mutated cell , whereas cells with the non mutated diallele  further multiplied giving the l <dig> cell layer of somaclone  <dig>  this hypothesis is in accordance with the fact that the most frequently observed allelic size variation is the addition of one motif  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
regeneration via embryogenesis for chardonnay  <dig> could result generally in a non chimeric plant and in an unchanged phenotype and would be well suited for gene transfer.
