BACKGROUND
in  <dig>  fox and raichle observed by positron emission tomography  a mismatch between glucose uptake and oxygen consumption, raising the possibility that aerobic glycolysis, i.e. the nonoxidative consumption of glucose in the presence of oxygen, may occur in the brain during focal physiologic neural activity  <cit> . further support to this idea was brought by the observation that a lactate peak could be measured during physiological activation by 1h-magnetic resonance spectroscopy   <cit> . with the 2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic technique, glucose uptake has consistently been observed in the neuropil, i.e. in regions enriched in dendrites, axons and the astrocytic processes that ensheathe synapses, not the cell bodies  <cit> .

since modern imaging techniques such as pet and functional magnetic resonance imaging  are being increasingly used for clinical and fundamental biomedical research, it is of interest to understand cellular biochemical events underling observed signals.

these signals have been shown to result from the interactions between different cerebral cells, raising the concept of "neurovascular unit", including neurons, astrocytes and the vascular endothelium, whereby neuronal activity modulates vascular tension and metabolite delivery from the bloodstream  <cit> . apparently, the key cell for the control of vascular tension is the astrocyte  <cit>  . for these authors, the vascular tonus is regulated via the stimulation of astrocytic glutamate receptors  triggering the release of vasoactive arachidonic acid metabolites. however, various teams  <cit>  seem to think that the cytosolic nadh/nad+ ratio plays a key role in the modulation of vascular tonus. this ratio is though to be in very close equilibrium with the pyruvate/lactate ratio  <cit>  that depends on glycolysis.

since pyruvate represents the end-point of glycolysis in mammalian cells, our goal in this study was to indirectly investigate its fate by localizing the two major enzymatic components of its energy production pathways, i.e. the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  and lactate dehydrogenase subunit m .

pdhc is a large, highly organized assembly of several different catalytic and regulatory subunits which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-coa, co <dig> and nadh. pyruvate dehydrogenase  catalyzes the irreversible entry of pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is therefore a marker for oxidative metabolism, whereas lactate dehydrogenase m subunit  is necessary for glycolysis to occur at high rate with production of lactate  <cit> . using immunohistochemistry, we seeked to examine their distribution in the human primary visual cortex and hippocampus. in these two regions, 2-deoxyglucose has been shown to accumulate in specific layers, i.e. the hippocampal stratum moleculare  <cit>  and the layer iv of area  <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
specificity of the antibodies
immunohistochemical and western blot controls clearly showed that monoclonal antibodies  against ldh- <dig> and pdh were specific for lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme  <dig> and pyruvate dehydrogenase, respectively . figure 1a illustrates the western blot characterization of the anti-ldh- <dig> monoclonal antibody. in all cases, the antibody was specific for the monomeric form of the ldh- <dig> subunit whose molecular weight is  <dig> kda. the antibody did not react with purified ldh- <dig> , confirming its specificity for the m subunit of the enzyme. it reacted faintly with rabbit heart extracts  that contain minute amounts of the ldh- <dig> subunit, and strongly with rabbit muscle extracts , human hippocampal extracts  and the immunogen .

immunohistochemistry
the characterized monoclonal antibodies revealed patterns of immunostaining that were constant in all human brains investigated . the two antibodies raised against two different subunits of the pdhc gave identical results.

human occipital cortex
in the human occipital cortex, area  <dig> was more specifically studied . the pdh immunoreactivity was principally observed in layer iv, staining neuronal cell bodies . at the cellular level, virtually all neuronal bodies and dendrites were stained, whereas astrocytes were very faintly stained.

using polyclonal antibodies , we have previously shown that the ldh immunoreactivity of both m and h subunits is enriched in layers iv and vi of the occipital area  <dig>  <cit> . here, as shown in figure 2b and 2d, we confirm with a monoclonal antibody our previous observation of the apparently exclusive cellular distribution of ldh- <dig> immunoreactivity in astrocytes throughout the white matter and in cortical layer i of the visual cortex  <cit> . in addition, protoplasmic astrocytes also appear in layer iv of area  <dig>  in close association with dendrites, providing a laminar staining similar to that observed by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and also by 2-deoxyglucose uptake studies  <cit> . in the white matter of the occipital cortex, but also in that of parietal and frontal cortices virtually all astrocytes were intensively ldh- <dig> immunoreactive, suggesting that white matter astrocytes in general might be principally glycolytic.

human hippocampus
for both regions studied, a faint pdh immunoreactivity was revealed in astrocytes following longer incubation with the primary antibodies. in spite of signal amplification with tsa, no additional immunoreactivity was detected .

discussion
in this article, we describe for the first time the immunohistochemical distribution of pdh and ldh- <dig> subunits in two regions of the human brain. our monoclonal antibody to ldh- <dig> is highly specific that subunit of the enzyme and further confirms the results reported previously with the polyclonal antibody raised against rabbit muscle ldh- <dig>  <cit> . however, very recently, o'brien et al.  <cit>  report that in isolated rat brain synaptosols and cytoplasms of primary cultured neurons and astrocytes that the ldh- <dig> isoform  is present also in neurons, findings that seem to be in contradiction with the data presented here. of course however, cell cultures do not always reflect in vivo nerve cell phenotypes. in the human occipital cortex and hippocampus, the 2-dg autoradiographic technique has shown that glucose is principally taken up in specific layers, i.e. the layer iv of the occipital cortex  <cit>  and the stratum moleculare of the hippocampal formation  <cit> . in layer iv of the occipital cortex, a cellular compartmentalization was observed between ldh- <dig> and pdh immunolabeling, suggesting that astrocytes might principally produce lactate at a high rate and that the transformation of pyruvate to acetyl coa might essentially occur in neurons. in the hippocampus, the same cellular segregation was observed, with the additional observation of a regional mismatch between both enzymes. since 2-dg has clearly been observed to be taken up in the stratum moleculare  <cit> , a layer enriched in ldh- <dig> immunoreactive astrocytes, this finding is consistent with the existence of a high glycolytic activity in astrocytes resulting in lactate production  <cit> .

ldh- <dig> immunoreactivity was exclusively visualized in astrocytes in agreement with previous observation in human  <cit>  and in astroglial cell cultures  <cit> . no neurons revealed any ldh- <dig> immunoreactivity. the ldh- <dig> immunoreactive astrocytes were found in regions where 2-dg uptake is known to be maximal. however, ldh- <dig> immunoreactive astrocytes were also present in regions where no particular 2-dg uptake has been detected, i.e. the first cortical layer of occipital area  <dig>  the hippocampal alveus and the white matter. it is worth noting that these areas are virtually devoid of neuronal profiles. throughout the white matter, ldh- <dig> labelled astrocytes were numerous, and their distribution was homogenous. in the living rat, the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose has been found to be higher in grey matter than in white matter by a factor of approximately three-fold  <cit> , whereas cytochrome oxidase activity is about eight- to twelve-fold higher in grey matter than in white matter  <cit> . these observations suggest that the white matter might rely more on glycolytic metabolism than on oxidative phosphorylation and therefore produce lactate through ldh- <dig> subunit activity. indeed, there is very little pdh immunoreactivity in the white matter, while the ldh- <dig> immunolabeling is abundant and restricted to astrocytes. overall, the localization of the pdh immunoreactivity was similar to that previously observed  <cit>  and also overlapped previous reports of cytochrome oxidase immunolabeling, although patches were not observed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
results reported in this article demonstrate the existence of a cellular and regional compartmentalization in two enzymes  involved in glucose metabolism. at the cellular level, this compartmentalization is consistent with the notion of the existence of metabolic coupling between neurons and astrocytes, also known as the astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis .

although the existence of the anls is still debated  <cit> , evidence has come from two-photon microscopy. kasischke et al.  <cit>  measured, at a cellular resolution, the variations of fluorescence due to the variation of the free nadh/nad+ ratio. their results shown that neuronal activity provokes oxidative metabolism in neurons closely followed by glycolytic metabolism in neighbouring astrocytes. our present observations are fully consistent with this ex vivo data, whereby the intital oxidative metabolism is initiated by pdh catalysis and has a neuronal localization. the later the glycolytic activity is catalyzed by ldh- <dig> and is expressed in astrocytes. this late astrocytic glycolytic metabolism could be glutamate uptake stimulated  <cit> . as mentioned previously variation in nadh/nad+ in astrocytes may also be a key event modulating vascular tension  <cit> . if this is the case, one step forward has been made in understanding the cellular events underlying signals emitted in modern imaging techniques.

in conclusion, describing not only the cellular but also the regional distribution of the typically glycolytic enzyme ldh- <dig> in comparison to the oxidative pdh distribution provides new insight to the highly metabolic coupling of the interactions between brain cells.
