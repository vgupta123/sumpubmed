BACKGROUND
chromatin is a highly regulated and dynamic structure that is constantly remodeled during development in order to couple gene transcription events with cellular processes such as cell division and differentiation. histone modifications are an important mechanism regulating chromatin remodeling, and they are carried out by specific enzymes followed by recognition by so-called “histone reader” proteins  <cit> . the agenet and tudor domains, together with the chromatin-binding , bromo, bromo-adjacent homology , pwwp  and malignant brain tumor  domains are known as histone modification “readers” and present in many proteins classified as chromatin remodelers  <cit> . the agenet domain was first described as a plant-specific member of the larger royal domain family because of its similarity with animal tudor domain from fragile x mental retardation protein   <cit> . afterwards, the occurrence of agenet domain was also reported in human proteins  <cit> , therefore this protein family is now referred as agenet/tudor domain family. in the last years, more insights on how agenet/tudor proteins function are being revealed , including the identification of an rna-binding domain  in the neighborhood of the agenet/tudor domains from human fmrp, that is responsible for the rna-binding function  <cit> . still, very little is known about the role of agenet/tudor domain in plants and it’s importance for plant development.

agenet/tudor domain proteins are widespread in the plant kingdom, and  <dig> genes were identified in the arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> . emsy-like n-terminal , bah, plant homeodomain  and duf <dig> domains are reported to often co-occur with plant agenet/tudor domains, possibly conferring diverse functions to these proteins  <cit> . plant ent domains resemble those of the human oncoprotein emsy, reported as repressors of the transcriptional activator function of the tumor suppressor brca <dig>  <cit> . the bah domain is involved in epigenetic regulations acting in the formation of an aromatic cage that binds histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> dimethylation  of nucleosomes, interplaying dna methylation and histone modification  <cit> . phd domains are a class of zinc finger  motif that promotes protein-protein interactions in multi-protein complexes and participates in chromatin remodeling and ubiquitination processes  <cit> . duf <dig> domain was reported to be involved in mediating protein-protein interaction  <cit> . so far, only agenet/tudor that also contains ent domain have been functionally characterized in plants. in arabidopsis, atemsy-like  <dig>  and atemsy-like  <dig>  have been described to interact with the transcription factor enhanced downy mildew  <dig>  responsible for repressing expression of the flowering locus c , with consequences in flowering time control  <cit> . another ent/agenet/tudor protein was reported in maize, named r interacting factor <dig> , that is part of a complex that anchors in chromatin of promoter regions increasing acetylation of histone  <dig> lisyne  <dig> , to activate expression of selected genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . in addition, the arabidopsis coilin protein, that harbors a c-terminal agenet/tudor-like structure without any other classified domain, is able to bind rna in a non-specific manner with subsequent multimerization, which possibly facilitates its function as a scaffolding protein  <cit> .

histone modifications have profound effects on gene expression as well as on dna replication, but it has not been completely elucidated how these processes are integrated. in animals, agenet/tudor domain proteins have already been reported to have a role in chromatin modifications during dna repair, connecting it with cell cycle checkpoints. the tandem tudor domain containing the tumor suppressor p <dig> binding protein  <dig>  can bind to histone modification that marks double stranded dna breaks   <cit> , as well as interact with methylated retinoblastoma ; in this way, it connects the cell cycle control of rb with dna damage responses and chromatin remodeling processes  <cit> . spindilin is a tudor domain protein from humans that binds to methylated histone  <cit> , and is also known to bind to mitotic spindle and to respond to dsb  <cit> . the tudor domain fmrp has already been implicated in participating in dna repair by specifically binding to methylated histone that marks dna damage in human cells during replication stress  <cit> . in addition, the uhfr <dig> protein , also known as icbp <dig> in humans, is a tudor containing domain that has a central role in interconnecting the processes of histone methylation, dna methylation, dna repair and cell cycle regulation  <cit> . uhfr <dig> is a member of e <dig> ligase family with ring domain that recruits dna metyltransferase, and regulates expression of genes important at g <dig> to s transition phase including rb  <cit> .

in plants, the armadillo btb arabidopsis protein  <dig>  was described as a plant regulatory protein that is involved in the control of gene expression and dna replication  <cit> . abap <dig> associates with members of the pre-replication complex , and also binds to transcription factors to negatively regulate the transcription of essential pre-rc genes  <cit> . it participates in a signaling network that controls cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase, by integrating plant developmental signals with dna replication and transcription controls  <cit> . dna replication and transcription are dynamic processes dependent on the chromatin accessibility. still little is known on the role of histone modifications in coordinating replication and transcription, and how they are integrated with development.

here we report the identification and characterization of a novel agenet/tudor/duf <dig> domain protein that interacts with abap <dig>  named abap <dig> interacting protein  <dig> . first, a general bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses of the agenet/tudor family domain in the plant kingdom were carried out. it suggests that this family has a third structure conserved in animals and plants. also, a search in complete plant genomes has shown that agenet/tudor have expanded with plant evolution. thirty members of this family were identified in arabidopsis and they could be classified in four groups by phylogeny. the expression pattern of the different family members have reveled notorious incidence in reproductive tissues. the arabidopsis agenet/tudor domain protein aip <dig> was previously reported as a duf <dig> domain protein named duf <dig>  <cit> , and will be denoted in this article as aip <dig>  besides the interaction with abap <dig>  a negative regulator of dna replication and transcription, here we have identified that aip <dig> interacts in vivo with the plant histone modification “reader” lhp <dig> and with non-modified histones. aip <dig> is expressed in reproductive tissues and its down-regulation delays flower development timing. mrna levels of abap <dig> and lhp <dig> target genes were down regulated in flower buds of plants with reduced levels of aip <dig>  this is the first plant protein harboring agenet/tudor and duf <dig> domains, which is functionally characterized. the data may suggest that aip <dig> could act as a link between dna replication, transcription and chromatin remodeling during flower development.

RESULTS
agenet/tudor family members have expanded with the evolution of plants
most proteins containing agenet/tudor domain are still poorly characterized in plants. in order to get more insights into the evolution and possible biological role of these proteins, an in silico analysis of the agenet/tudor domain in the plant kingdom was performed. to search for proteins belonging to agenet/tudor domain family in plants, we used an agenet/tudor sequence from the gene at1g <dig> to perform tblastn query against available genome sequences in phytozome, ncbi, tair and congenie databases . the search included genomes of unicellular green algae , nonvascular plants , seedless plants , and seeded plants: gymnosperms  and angiosperms . redundant sequences were removed manually. in addition, the putative orthologs in arabidopsis of each protein containing agenet/tudor domain were identified by tblastn in tair .

in total,  <dig> species were studied, from green algae to angiosperms, as it was summarized in additional file  <dig>  the analysis revealed that lower plants such as green algae and moss have none or fewer agenet/tudor genes compared to those of higher plants. only one member of the agenet/tudor family was found in coccomyxa, four members were found in physcomitrella patens, and above ten members were identified in most of the higher plants. this data suggested that the number of agenet/tudor family members expanded in plant genomes with the evolution of plants.

phylogenetic analyses of proteins containing agenet/tudor domains in the plant kingdom show key ramifications in higher plants
to investigate evolutionary changes of proteins containing agenet/tudor domains, phylogenetic analyses using the full-length sequences of  <dig> domains from  <dig> species from green algae to angiosperms were conducted. some bootstrap values for interior branches were low because of the large number of sequences included  <cit> . a relatively well-supported phylogenetic tree could be constructed after removing all arabidopsis proteins, possibly due to the large amount of noise these very diverse sequences caused in the program while resolving the analysis . the members of the agenet/tudor family were grouped in three main clades separated by their conserved domains other than agenet/tudor. the three clades were: a) the derived clade, containing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species; b) the intermediate clade, containing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species; c) the ancient  clade, containing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of the family of agenet/tudor proteins in the plant kingdom. a phylogenetic analysis represented as a simplified version of the neighbor joining  tree, with  <dig> sequences of proteins from  <dig> species, from green algae to angiosperms. the tree was divided into three clades: a) the derived clade, containing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species, that harbor agenet/tudor domains combined with bah, duf <dig>  f-box and other domains; b) the intermediate clade, containing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species, that harbor repetitions of agenet/tudor domains at n-term or central, combined or not with ent domain; c) the ancient  clade, containing  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species, harboring one agenet/tudor domain in the c-term. b schematic representation of the distribution of members of the agenet/tudor family, the diversity of co-occurring domains and their phylogenetic relationships. there were  <dig> sequences of  <dig> species in  <dig> families from green algae to angiosperms. the squares represent the domains present in the proteins and the colors specify the domains according to the legend. a few rare domains are not represented. the species are listed in additional file 7




to further investigate the evolutionary relationships observed between agenet/tudor members of the three clades, a search for conserved domains was also performed for all sequences using pfam  <cit>  and smart  <cit>  with e-value cutoff of > e- <dig> for domain identification. the number of agenet/tudor domains and their position  was annotated for each sequence, as well as other domains that may co-occur with agenet/tudor domain . the analyses revealed that the first basal agenet/tudor domain did not co-exist with other domains in the same protein. nevertheless, in bryophyta and lycopodiaophyta the agenet/tudor got combined with bah domains. in gymnosperms it co-exists with ent. finally, in angiosperms, the family was enriched with agenet/tudor repetitions and the presence of other classes of domains in the same protein structure.

plant agenet/tudor domains are structurally very similar to the animal tudor domain
agenet/tudor domain has been previously classified as a member of the royal family of domains, and agenet/tudor was described as a tudor-like plant domain  <cit> . previously, it has been reported that the agenet/tudor domains from arabidopsis proteins contain an average of  <dig> amino acids within a few conserved positions and a distant relation based on sequence alignment with royal family domains  <cit> . in order to construct a general signature for agenet/tudor domains in the plant kingdom, a multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> most distinguished agenet/tudor sequences found in plants was performed to determine the canonical conserved residues that were analyzed by weblogo  . the agenet/tudor domain signature from plants has a few conserved amino acids  through the domain sequence within  <dig> to  <dig> aa length, and it was very similar to the logo constructed based only on arabidopsis’s agenet/tudor domains and frmps from animal. the agenet/tudor domain signature revealed that the primary sequences of this domain are very variable among different proteins. in order to investigate the structural homology of the agenet/tudor domains from plant proteins, first the characteristic of secondary structure was built by aligning different agenet/tudor proteins from different plants using multalin  <cit>  and espript  <cit> . the secondary structure was characterized by strict β-turns, four beta-sheets and a 310-helices , . next, the structural homology among the same agenet/tudor sequences was evaluated using i-tasser  <cit> . all agenet/tudor models produced had shown significant parameters of c-score and tm-score  and the characteristic structure of tudor-like beta-barrel folding was suggested to be conserved in the plant agenet/tudor models proposed in this study . the individual structures are represented in additional file  <dig>  all together, the secondary structure models predicted in this work showed that the plant agenet/tudor domains might be, in general, very similar between themselves, indicating that they may belong to a consistent family of protein domains despite their low identity in amino acid sequences.fig.  <dig> signature and predicted structure of agenet/tudor domain from arabidopsis proteins. a alignment of agenet/tudor sequences from arabidopsis showing the canonical conserved residues analyzed by weblogo. the highly conserved residues are represented as larger letters in the sequence. although very diverse, some key-positions contain conserved amino acids and possibly maintain the conserved secondary structure observed. b multiple sequence alignment of agenet/tudor domain sequences from plant proteins: the alignment was performed using multalin and the result submitted to espript server to plot the secondary structure information of the conserved domains over their primary sequence. on the secondary structure displayed, 310-helices are represented as small squiggles , β-strands are rendered as arrows, and strict β-turns . on the primary sequence alignment, the red characters represent similarity of the amino acid residues in the same group of one column and the blue frame represents the similarity across groups. the sequences used for structural analysis and computer modeling were chosen to represent all clades of plants: gymnosperm picea abies ma_20337g0010; angiosperm monocot oryza sativa os05g04180; angiosperm eudicot populus trichocarpa potri_018g030500_ <dig>  brassica rapa bra <dig>  manihot esculenta cassava4_1_ <dig>  a. thaliana at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  the two sequences of agenet/tudor repetitions from aip <dig> were used . c overlapping agenet/tudor models generated in the i-tasser server. the structures are colored in white , purple , firebrick , orange , blue , cyan , yellow , and green 



the agenet/tudor family in arabidopsis has four different classes based on domain organization
in order to better understand the phylogeny of agenet/tudor containing proteins from arabidopsis, the  <dig> sequences from the family members were used to construct a tree in mega  <dig>  program  <cit> . the fmrps from human, mouse, fly and zebra fish sequences from ncbi  <cit>  were also used. a paraphyletic tree focusing on functional characterization was constructed and allowed the visualization of distinct branches from which the proteins were classified based on the organization of their domains. the agenet/tudor class i has n terminal agenet/tudor domains and some members also harbor the ent domain. class ii proteins co-occur with duf <dig> domain in the c-terminus. class iii has more diverse members with agenet/tudor domains in n and/or c terminal positions, multiple agenet/tudors repetitions or co-exist with bah or phd. class iv proteins are the most similar to the animal fmrps .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic classification of the agenet/tudor family in arabidopsis. the phylogenetic tree  was constructed by mega <dig> using the members found in arabidopsis and the proteins fmr <dig> and fmr <dig> of d. melanogaster, m. musculus, d. rerio and h. sapiens as roots 



to investigate possible developmental processes in which the distinct classes of agenet/tudor genes in arabidopsis could participate, their expression pattern was searched in silico through genevestigator database  <cit> . in general, members of the agenet/tudor family were highly expressed in reproductive tissues as seed and embryo . the different agenet/tudor family classes showed some particularities in the expression profiles of their members . class i genes were highly expressed in seed and embryo tissues. class ii were likewise found in seed and embryo, but were also highly expressed in shoot apex and flower female tissues . the expression of class iii members was distributed among different plant organs and tissues, with some genes being more expressed in pollen and seed. from the five members of class iv, two genes were not represented in microarray data experiments, invalidating analysis of patterns. the temporal expression of agenet/tudor domain proteins during development was also analyzed in silico through genevestigator database . class i members showed moderate levels of expression with almost no variation during development, and increased mrna levels were observed in late maturation of seeds and senescence of leaves. class ii members also exhibited moderate expression levels, peaking during bolting phase and embryo maturation phase. expression profile of class iii members was again very diverse.fig.  <dig> expression profile of members assigned in each class of agenet/tudor family in arabidopsis. the expression pattern is showed in different plant tissues and organs as a heat map representation of the average values among the expression values published in many microarray experiments available in genevestigator   <cit> . the genes at5g <dig> and at3g <dig> from class iv are out of analysis since there are no probes in the available microarray data



interestingly, the arabidopsis agenet/tudor genes were highly expressed in reproductive tissues and evolutionary analysis showed a dramatic increase of members and domains diversity of agenet/tudor family in the flowering plants . all together, the data suggests a possible role of agenet/tudor domain proteins during flower development and embryo formation.

identification of aip <dig> as an agenet/tudor/duf <dig> domain protein that interacts with abap1
to search for proteins that could participate with abap <dig> in the control of dna replication and transcription, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with an arabidopsis cdna library using abap <dig> as bait  <cit> . members of transcription factors families were identified, such as tcp <dig>  which acts together with abap <dig> regulating cell division in leaves  <cit> . among the abap1-interacting proteins  identified, there was aip <dig> , an unknown protein predicted with  <dig> amino acids and approximately  <dig>  kda. it harbors two repeats of agenet/tudor domain in its n-terminal region  as well as a duf <dig> domain in its c-terminus  . the agenet/tudors domain is  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids long and the duf <dig> domain is  <dig> amino acids long. previous studies on duf <dig> gene family of arabidopsis described agenet/tudor as an rna-binding domain based on its similarity to animal tudor domain from fmrp and named aip <dig> as duf <dig>  <cit> . aip <dig> belongs to class ii of agenet/tudor family in arabidopsis, together with others agenet/tudor/duf <dig> proteins .fig.  <dig> characterization of aip <dig> protein interactions and subcellular localization. a schematic representation of aip <dig> and abap <dig> proteins. aip <dig> harbors two repetitions of agenet/tudor  domains in its n-terminal and a duf <dig> in the c-terminal ; abap <dig> harbors eight beta-catenin-type armadillo  at its n-terminal and one btb/ poz  domain in the c-terminal. b yeast two hybrid assays with the c-terminal region of aip <dig>  or the complete aip <dig> cds fused with gal <dig> dad  against full-length abap <dig> fused with gal <dig> dbd. gal <dig> dbd empty vector was used as negative control. details of the constructs can be found in additional file  <dig>  yeast transformation was selected in -l-t , and protein interactions were selected in -l-t-h or -l-t-h-a  that contains the duf <dig> domain and the n terminus region of abap <dig>  that contains the beta-catenin-type armadillo repeats  . surprisingly, the full-length aip <dig> did not interact with abap <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid assay . nevertheless, the association between abap <dig> and the full length aip <dig> was confirmed in gst pulldown experiments with his::abap <dig> and gst::aip <dig> , and it was further confirmed in semi-in vivo pulldown assays with gst::aip <dig> and protein extracts of 10 day-old arabidopsis plants .

aip <dig> does not exhibit any clear dna-binding signature and no signal peptide prediction by ipsort search. co-transfection experiments with rfp::aip <dig> and gfp::abap <dig> in nicotiana benthamiana leaf abaxial epidermis confirmed the nuclear localization of aip <dig>  <cit> , and showed co-localization with abap <dig> . confocal microscopy images indicated that aip <dig> was exclusively located in the nucleus, and enriched in nuclear domains . remarkably, abap <dig> was also reported to be exclusively located in the nucleus, homogeneously distributed or enriched in nuclear domains in a speckle pattern  <cit> .

all together, the data suggests that aip <dig> could participate with abap <dig> in regulatory complexes. an important question to be addressed is whether aip <dig> has a role on chromatin remodeling during abap1’s regulation of dna replication and/or gene expression.

aip <dig> agenet/tudor domain is most similar in structure to a tudor domain that functions as histone modification reader
to get insights into the function of the agenet/tudor domain from aip <dig>  we first addressed how close aip <dig> domain is to the animal tudor domains, by performing computer structural modeling. for profunc analysis  <cit> , the second repetition of agenet/tudor domain in the n terminus from aip <dig> was used as query. the analysis showed that all structures from the protein data base  with higher scores were found in animal tudor domains . since all agenet/tudor modeled domains may have a conserved tudor-like beta-barrel folding, the agenet/tudor and tudor domains might have similar folding and structure. the root-mean-square deviation  between the c-alpha atoms and the statistic relevant z-score of the compared structures  insure the significance of the hits found. the best outcome  was superposed to the aip <dig> n terminus agenet/tudor domain  and a directly similarity can be observed . the most similar agenet/tudor domain structure  is present in the phd finger protein  <dig> , a polycomb group  gene that is a histone modification reader known to specifically bind to histone h3k36me <dig> and to recruit the polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  in humans  <cit> . pcgs are known to silence expression mostly thought regulation of chromatin structure, in part through post-translational modification of histones  <cit> .fig.  <dig> predicted secondary structure matching of agenet/tudor domain from aip <dig> with different tudor domains. a alignment of secondary structures performed by profunc using agenet/tudor sequence from aip <dig> as query. the proteins shown are:  <dig>  phf <dig> tudor in complex with h3k36me <dig> by x-ray diffraction;  <dig>  crystal structure of tudor domain  <dig> of human phf <dig> by x-ray diffraction;  <dig>  tudor domain of human tdrd <dig>  by x-ray diffraction;  <dig>  solution nmr  for human phf <dig> linking h3k36me;  <dig>  tudor domain of human tdrd <dig> by x-ray diffraction;  <dig>  human tudor domain of smn <dig> in complex with aa organic molecule by x-ray diffraction;  <dig>  human tdrd <dig> complex with asymmetric dimethylarginine mark in histone by solution nmr;  <dig>  solution nmr structure of the human tudor domain of phf <dig>  isoform b;  <dig>  the second tudor domain of human phf <dig> by x-ray diffraction. b modeled structure of the agenet/tudor domain of aip <dig>  superimposed to the tudor domain of phf <dig>  



aip <dig> is highly expressed in reproductive tissues
to identify possible functions for aip <dig> during plant development, its gene expression profile was analyzed in silico in open access microarray databases and by qrt-pcr assays . high aip <dig> expression was observed in various reproductive tissues, such as carpel and in seed tissues such as chalazal seed coat of globular and heart shape embryos  <cit>  and in the suspensor, where its expression was about  <dig>  times higher than in others tissues  <cit>  . qrt-pcr confirmed a high expression of aip <dig> in siliques and flower buds in comparison to developed flowers and leafs . the shoot apex meristem also showed high aip <dig> mrna levels  <cit>  . a peak of aip <dig> expression was observed during bolting , the timing of development that marks the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, and a second peak of expression was observed during seed development. all together, the data revealed a peak of expression of aip <dig> during transition of vegetative to reproductive phase of development, with the main expression occurring in early flower development, especially in female organs, suggesting that aip <dig> might have, amongst other functions, a role during plant reproductive phase.fig.  <dig> aip <dig> expression in different arabidopsis tissues and organs. relative mrna levels of aip <dig> were determined by qrt-pcr in a different organs from 30 day-old plants; except leaves which have been harvested from 14 day-old plants; b entire plants in different stages of development. values were normalized with atubi <dig> as reference gene. data shown represent mean values obtained from independent amplification reactions  and biological replicates . each biological replicate was performed with material collected from a pool of at least six plants. bars indicate mean ± standard error of biological replicates

to obtain further insights into aip <dig> function, other interacting proteins and complexes in which aip <dig> takes part were searched using yeast two-hybrid assays. aip <dig> interaction with other proteins related to the abap <dig> network, pre-rc members and chromatin remodeling proteins was tested using the aip <dig> c terminus region harboring the duf <dig> domain, since the full-length aip <dig> was not able to establish protein-protein interactions in the yeast two-hybrid assay. the complete list of pair interactions tested by yeast-two hybrid is listed in additional file  <dig>  differing from abap <dig>  aip <dig> did not show positive interactions with proteins that are part of the pre-rc. interestingly, aip <dig> c-term was able to form homodimer with the aip <dig> full-length protein in the yeast-two hybrid assay  and the association of the full-length aip <dig> proteins was observed in gst pulldown assays with gst::aip <dig> and his::aip <dig> . aip <dig> also interacted with aria - the abap <dig> homolog  and a weak interaction between the duf <dig> domain of aip <dig> and the lhp <dig> full-length protein was identified by yeast-two hybrid . these interactions were further confirmed by gst pulldown assays with cds sequences in fusions: gst::aip <dig> and his::aria or his::lhp <dig> . the association with lhp <dig> supports a possible role of aip <dig> protein on chromatin remodeling, since it is suggested that lhp <dig> is a regulator of gene expression by controlling chromatin packaging depending on the status of methylation of its histones  <cit> .fig.  <dig> aip <dig> protein interactions. a yeast two hybrid assay with the c-terminal of aip <dig>  fused with gal <dig> dad  against aria, aip <dig> and lhp <dig> full-length cdss fused with gal <dig> dbd. gal <dig> dbd empty vector was used as negative control. details of the constructs can be found in additional file  <dig>  yeast transformation was selected in -l-t , and protein interactions were selected in -l-t-h or -l-t-h-a  assay was performed using aip <dig> as bait willing to identify protein complexes formed in vivo . however, tap was hampered by the difficulty to well express full length aip <dig> fused to the affinity tag in cell cultures. nevertheless, the output from the tap purification assays was a small portion of a conserved sequence of the histone superfamily . since aip <dig> is member of the royal domain family that interacts with the chromatin remodeler lhp <dig> and with the dna replication and transcription regulator abap <dig>  it is reasonable to expect that aip <dig> could bind to histones, whether they are modified by methylation or acetylation, or none. to further investigate a possible association between aip <dig> and histones, a semi-in vivo pulldown assay was performed using full-length gst::aip <dig> and protein extracts of arabidopsis 10 day-old plantlets, and the aip <dig> interacting proteins were assayed with antibodies against specific histones . the results showed that aip <dig> could bind to the non-modified histones h <dig>  h2b, h <dig> and h <dig>  however, it couldn’t bind to the two forms of acetylated histones, h3k9ac and h3k14a , that are recognized in maize by the agenet/tudor/ent domain protein rif <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that the two agenet/tudor members might have evolved different roles on plant development.

aip <dig> down regulation delays flower maturation
to access the function of aip <dig> during arabidopsis development, plants with reduced or silenced expression levels of aip <dig> were searched in the collections of t-dna insertion mutants. no salk t-dna insertions were found in aip <dig>  a homozygote gabi line mutant  with the t-dna inserted in the third intron was characterized . aip <dig> expression levels were around three fold decreased in gabi_465b <dig> homozygote plants  .fig.  <dig> molecular and phenotypic analyses of aip1kd lines. a schematic representation of aip1kd line  indicating the t-dna insertion in the third intron. b relative mrna levels of aip <dig> in 21 day-old wt and aip1

the phenotype of aip1kd plants was analyzed all over development, and it was compared with wild type control lines. during vegetative development, aip1kd plants with lower levels of aip <dig> developed normally and no significant difference was observed in leaf area, number of cells and ploidy, as well as in root growth . during reproductive phase, a slight difference in developmental timing of reproductive organs could be seen in the aip1kd mutant, as 30 day-old plants had developed a reduced number of inflorescences with mature flowers and siliques per plant . however, these differences disappeared during plant senescence , if plants are kept in watering. in an attempt to measure the timing of flower development in 30 day-old aip1kd mutants, the number of visible flower buds per inflorescences containing one open-flower in stage 6- <dig>  according to  <cit> , was counted under binocle . although there was a tendency for a delay in flower maturation in the aip1kd mutant, it is not statistically different.

although plants full silenced for aip <dig> could not be obtained, the phenotype of plants with reduced levels of aip <dig> suggested a role of this protein in flowering and reproduction, and it is consistent with high expression levels of aip <dig> in this phase of plant development. in addition, aip <dig> possible orthologs were found only in angiosperm species .

down regulation of aip <dig> increases expression levels of abap <dig> and lhp <dig> target genes
in order to investigate if aip <dig> could act together with abap <dig> and lhp <dig> during flower development, mrna levels of abap <dig> and lhp <dig> target genes were analyzed in flower buds of plants with reduced levels of aip <dig>  compared to wt control plants, by qpcr.

to verify a possible role of aip <dig> in dna replication, expression of cdt1b, one component of the pre-rc that is a target of abap <dig> transcription repression  was investigated. besides being transcriptionally regulated, cdt1b is a dna replication marker, as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen  <dig> , another s phase marker gene that is responsible to restore replication fork progression when dna is damaged  <cit> . also, the expression of g2-m transition and cell division markers, as cyclinb1; <dig> and cdkb2; <dig> was analyzed  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  aip <dig> expression levels were reduced by approximately 50 % in aip1kd flower buds compared to control plants. on the other hand, cdt1b and pcna <dig> mrna levels were highly increased in aip1kd flower buds, suggesting that aip <dig> might operate with abap <dig> negatively regulating dna replication. an increase in cyclinb1; <dig> and cdkb2; <dig> mrna levels were also observed in aip1kd flower buds , indicating that the dna replication stimulus is possibly followed by an increase in cell proliferation rates and/or a delay in cell differentiation in aip1kd mutants.fig.  <dig> gene expression in aip1

to test a role of aip <dig> together with lhp <dig> in flower development, the expression of genes epigenetically repressed by lhp <dig>  known as floral development target genes such as flower locus t , agamous  and apetalla  <dig>   <cit> , was analyzed. as shown in fig. 10b, mrna levels of ft, ag and ap <dig> increased in aip1kd flower buds, compared to control. all together, the data showed that aip <dig> interacts with abap <dig> and lhp <dig> and possibly participates in the repression of expression of some of their target genes during flower development.

discussion
the dynamics of chromatin modification and accessibility is likely to exert a key role in regulating dna replication and transcription, critical cellular processes pivotal for modulating plant growth and development. however, how these processes are coordinated and integrated with developmental signals has not yet been fully clarified. in this work we investigated a family of chromatin remodeling proteins in plants, containing the agenet/tudor domain, described as histone modification “readers”. this class of proteins is still poorly characterized in the plant kingdom. we identified and characterized a novel member, named aip <dig> and previously called duf <dig>  <cit> , which can further reveal insights into mechanisms connecting dna replication, gene transcription and chromatin remodeling.

plant proteins with agenet/tudor domain could have acquired roles in developmental processes occurring during plant reproductive phase
in this study,  <dig> proteins containing the agenet/tudor domain in plants, including at least  <dig> previously undefined ones, were described. our analysis revealed just a single protein containing the agenet/tudor domain in one out of four green algae species analyzed, suggesting this family got emerge since then. phylogenetic analyses using the  <dig> members of agenet/tudor family from  <dig> plant species supported that the agenet/tudor family has a monophyletic origin. previous studies on the duf <dig> protein family, comprising some agenet/tudor domain proteins from a. thaliana, rice, poplar and vitis vinifera, also supported the common ancestral origin for this family  <cit> .

agenet/tudor domain has been previously classified as a member of the royal family of domains, and agenet/tudor was described as a tudor-like plant domain  <cit> . during many years tudor was described as a rna binding domain  <cit> , with some involvement in interaction with modified histone tails, and in dna repair and cell cycle, but without a clear understanding of its function . it was from the observations on the plant agenet/tudor domain  <cit>  that it was recently possible to fully comprehend the human tudor structure and function . it was elucidated that the tudor domain is not the responsible for interacting with nucleic acids, but a neighbor domain called kh, present in some of the tudor proteins  <cit> . although agenet/tudor domains have been described as an rna binding domain  <cit> , this activity has not been experimentally demonstrated. furthermore, the kh domain have not been found in plant agenet/tudor proteins so far; however the prediction of this domain depends on the use of more sophisticated protein structure tools and might thus been overlooked. one exception is the atcoilin protein that has three sites that bind to rna, but none are located in the agenet/tudor domain region  <cit> . the prediction of kh domain depends on the use of more sophisticated protein structure tools, therefore it is reasonable to expect that other plant agenet/tudor proteins also contain the kh domain, and are able to bind histones and rnas.

we found evidences to suggest that plant proteins containing the agenet/tudor domain alone or coexisting with the bah domain represent the oldest members in an evolutionary scale. green algae contain a single protein with only one agenet/tudor domain, whereas in bryophyte and lycopodiophyte the agenet/tudor domain co-occurs with the bah domain. later in evolution, in gymnosperms, the ent domain can co-occur with the agenet/tudor domain. finally, a “boom” of diversity of forms and sequences of agenet/tudor proteins has occurred in angiosperm species that might be correlated with a functional diversification of agenet/tudor proteins during plant reproduction and processes of flower development. corroborating with a role of members of this family in plant reproductive phase, the expression profile of agenet/tudor family in arabidopsis showed main expression in reproductive tissues and embryo.

some of the animal agenet/tudor domain proteins have been implicated in having a role during gametogenesis. the tudor-sn  protein of drosophila is involved in oogenesis  <cit>  and five from eleven copies of its tudor domains are sufficient for the germ cell formation  <cit> . although the mechanism of action of tsn is still unclear, it is part of the risc complex that regulates rna silencing  <cit> . fmrp’s tudor domains can bind to chromatin through h3k79me to respond to dsb by regulating the deposition of a variant of histone, yh2a.x, and mutations in this gene lead to defects in gametogenesis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, it was suggested that the ent/agenet/tudor proteins denominated atemls, together with edm <dig>  may link race-specific pathogen recognition to general defense mechanisms through chromatin remodeling processes  <cit> . also, edm <dig> positively affects floral transition by suppressing flc expression  <cit> , and eml <dig> and eml <dig> mutants have and early-flowering phenotype  <cit> . another well-described regulator of flc is lhp <dig>  a chromo domain containing protein involved in chromatin regulation of flower timing in the apical meristem of arabidopsis. lhp <dig> recognizes and binds to h3k27me <dig>  epigenetically regulating the levels of flc before and after the vernalization period  <cit> , as well as other mads box genes  <cit> . lhp <dig> homologs were found only in angiosperms, suggesting that lhp <dig> role in flower timing and development might be spread in flowering plant species  <cit> .

we also found that aip1’s homologues are exclusively found in the angiosperm clade, supporting the idea of a function in flower timing and/or development. moreover, aip <dig> interacts with lhp <dig> and both are expressed in the shoot apical meristem and reproductive tissues, suggesting they may share a role in these organs. moreover, our studies showed that mutant plants with decreased expression of aip <dig> exhibited higher expression levels of flower development genes epigenetically regulated by lhp <dig>  and these plants also showed a small delay in the timing of flower development, forming inflorescences with at least one flower bud more, compared to wild type. the phenotype was subtle and occurred during just a brief window of time, possibly because around 40 % of aip <dig> mrna levels were still expressed in these plants and/or there is redundancy in the regulation of the process. mutants in the gene corymbosa <dig> , encoding a methyltransferase of mirnas and sirnas, have a phenotype with little effect on the timing of floral induction, but showing notably a delay in the development of flowers  <cit> . as a result, crm <dig> mutants have an increased number of flower buds in the inflorescences  <cit> , similarly as the phenotype observed in aip1kd mutant. even though the mechanism of action is still not known, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that an epigenetic regulation of gene expression is affecting flower development process in both mutants.

aip <dig> is an agenet/tudor protein in plants that might connect cell cycle and chromatin remodeling processes
the involvement of proteins containing agenet/tudor domain in chromatin remodeling and cell cycle regulation is still not well understood. in plants, members of this protein family were not yet reported as directly involved in chromatin dynamics during cell cycle. this work characterized in more detail the agenet/tudor protein aip <dig>  that binds to histones and to abap <dig>  a regulator of dna transcription and of licensing dna to replicate in arabidopsis  <cit> . the full-length gst::aip <dig> was able to pull down both abap <dig> and histones in a semi-in vivo gst pulldown assays, suggesting that aip <dig>  abap <dig> and histones might be found in the same complex. qrt-pcr data showed that expression of cdt <dig>  a prerc gene repressed by abap <dig>  is increased in aip1kd; as well as the expression of other cell division markers. these findings support that aip <dig> could play a role in cell cycle and/or gene expression regulation together with abap <dig>  controlling cellular events during g <dig> to s phase transition in arabidopsis. an important issue is to unravel the mechanisms by which agenet/tudor integrates these cellular processes. possibly, it might involve the interaction with histones and chromatin remodeling proteins.

agenet/tudor proteins in animals have been described as readers of various histone modifications. the tudor domain fmrp has been implicated in participating in dna repair by specifically binding to h3k79me  <cit> . 53bp <dig> can control of s phase duration by interacting with the rb protein methylated at k <dig>  maintaining its hypomethylated status  <cit> , as well as it can bind to h4k20me <dig>  a dsb mark  <cit> . the tandem tudor domain protein spindlin <dig> from humans recognizes h3k <dig> methylation  <cit> , and can bind to mitotic spindle and respond to dsb  <cit> .

the primary structure of agenet/tudor domain can be very variable in plants. it contains approximately  <dig> to  <dig> aa length with few  conserved amino acids in the primary structure, as shown in the weblogo signature. however, the structural modeling suggested that the plant agenet/tudor domains might be similar between themselves, indicating that they belong to a consistent family of protein domains. moreover, all plant agenet/tudor and animal tudor domains modeled in this work presented favorable results to a conserved tudor-like beta-barrel folding, similar to the previous description for animal tudor folding  <cit> , suggesting that these domains might have evolved separately but converged to a similar structure and its associated folding. although plant agenet/tudor domain proteins have been implicated in chromatin remodeling processes , a direct binding to histones has not been reported. in this work, a strong interaction of aip <dig> with non-modified histones h <dig>  h2b, h <dig> and h <dig> was observed. however, aip <dig> did not associate with two forms of acetylated histones tested in semi-in vivo pulldown assay, the h3k9ac and h3k14ac , which are possibly recognized by the agenet/tudor/ent rif <dig> protein from maize  <cit> . possibly, aip <dig> could recognize different histone modifications, having evolved a different role on plant development. moreover, we found that aip <dig> also interacted with lhp <dig>  a chromo domain protein that recognizes and binds to h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the predicted structure of the aip <dig> agenet/tudor domain is most similar to the one present in phf <dig>  known to specifically bind to histone h3k36me <dig>  <cit> . although in this work we identified aip <dig> interaction with non-modified histones, it could recognize histone modifications different than the ones tested, and further protein structural and interaction works are needed to address aip <dig> mechanism of action in chromatin remodeling.

recently, it has been reported that arabidopsis sawadee homeodomain homolog  <dig>  harbors a domain very similar in structure with agenet/tudor, the sawadee domain  <cit> . it shows preferential binding to di- or trimethylated h3k <dig> but it can also bind non-modified h3k <dig>  <cit> . it has been proposed that shh <dig> agenet/tudor domains may allow the transcription, signalized by h3k <dig>  even though a silence mark  is present  <cit> .

the tudor protein uhfr <dig> has an allosteric regulation where in a ground state the c-terminal polybasic region of the protein is folded back onto the tudor domain repetitions, while the phd domain binds to unmodified h <dig>  in an active state, a cofactor  is linked to the polybasic region, which stabilizes the orientation of the tudor domains, giving access to bind to modified histones   <cit> . aip <dig> could bind only non-modified histones or, most probably, the internal folding of the protein and/or the binding to an external molecule may regulate different active states where aip <dig> can bind histones in a selective way. a regulation of aip <dig> protein interactions by internal folding states is supported by the results observed in yeast two-hybrid assays. although in vitro and semi-in vivo gst pulldown assays showed interaction between full length aip <dig> and abap <dig>  aria, lhp <dig> and itself, only homodimers of aip <dig> could be observed in yeast two-hybrid assays. possibly, the native structure of aip <dig> needs a structural modification to allow duf <dig> to bind to these proteins. we could speculate that this modification might involve the association of the n terminus region of aip <dig> with histones, in order to allow duf <dig> to bind to the other proteins.

despite the importance of polycomb genes in animal and plant development, their mechanism of action in plants are still poorly understood  <cit> . in this work we showed that aip <dig> can bind lhp <dig>  a major protein for polycomb repressor complex1-like  functions in plants  <cit> . also, the agenet/tudor domain of aip <dig> has a predicted structure very close to the tudor domains from phf <dig> proteins from mammals that bind to methylated histones necessarily to recruit prc <dig> to chromatin  <cit> . furthermore, lhp <dig> was already reported to bind to a member of prc <dig>  promoting its recruitment to chromatin regions that carry h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . the lhp <dig> binding to h3k27me <dig> is required for its function and for repression of several pcg protein targets such as ft, ag and ap <dig>  <cit> , and this work showed that these three genes are up regulated in aip1kd plants. it has been suggested that interaction between plant prc2-like and prc1-like complexes in plants contributes to the inheritance of h3k27me <dig> during dna replication and to the maintenance of h3k27me <dig> levels during interphase  <cit> . therefore, we can speculate that, by associating with lhp <dig> and abap <dig>  aip <dig> could participate in protein complexes that act via histone modification and chromatin remodeling to regulate gene expression during flower development. finally, the delay in flower maturation observed in aip1kd plants could be caused by up regulation of the expression of dna replication, cell division and flower development genes, leading to unbalanced cell division and cell differentiation rates in the developing flowers.

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic and expression analysis of plant proteins containing agenet/tudor domain suggest that they might have acquired roles during plant reproduction. we propose that aip <dig> is a novel member of the agenet/tudor family that might has a role in interconnecting the processes of dna replication and/or dna transcription with the dynamics of chromatin accessibility, to regulate flower development in arabidopsis. this hypothesis is supported by the finding that aip <dig> interacts with histones, abap <dig>  aria and lhp1; moreover aip <dig>  abap <dig> and histones seems to be found in vivo in the same complex. also, the predicted structure of the agenet/tudor domain of aip <dig> is most similar to those of phf <dig> proteins from mammals that recruit prc <dig> to chromatin; and lhp <dig> binds to a member of prc <dig> in plants, promoting its recruitment to chromatin to regulate expression of genes involved in flowering. additionally, putative aip <dig> orthologs are exclusively present in the angiosperm clade. furthermore, aip <dig> is mainly expressed in reproductive tissues and plants with reduced expression of aip <dig> show a delay in the timing of flower development. finally, mrna levels of genes that are target of abap <dig> or lhp <dig> transcription repression were down regulated in flower buds of plants with reduced levels of aip <dig>  further biochemical and structural analysis of protein complexes containing aip1/duf <dig> will be important to unravel the mechanisms by which agenet/tudor integrates these cellular processes.
