BACKGROUND
high-throughput “next-generation” sequencing is now a cost effective tool for most genetics laboratories, making new approaches for genetic analysis a possibility. one of the promising aspects of next-generation sequencing data is that it can be used to rapidly define genomic regions of interest in linkage and quantitative genetics experiments. there are myriad ways that this can be accomplished but no straightforward statistical and data processing approach has been developed to distinguish the ‘signal’ from the ‘noise’. some researchers have simplified the analysis by establishing specially prepared genetic strains, as in linkage by introgression  <cit> . in other systems sequencing of the parental genomes has been used to allow parentage to be assigned to single nucleotide polymorphisms , which is an alternative strategy to facilitate identification of linkage to a trait or traits. it is challenging, however, to confidently determine the parentage assignment of snps in genome-wide datasets that have a relatively low average coverage , such as might be encountered in organisms with large genomes.

in this study we developed a relatively simple and robust method that does not require the parental genomes to be known or sequenced. the method involves bulk-segregant sequence analysis and averaging frequencies of snps attaining differential homozygosity to display genomic regions containing genes for a specific trait. we used this method to identify genes conferring resistance to an insecticidal fumigant, phosphine  in a cosmopolitan grain insect pest, tribolium castaneum. phosphine is an effective fumigant, used worldwide to protect grain harvest from insect pests  <cit> . it has been in use for nearly five decades owing to its broad spectrum of activity and residue-free characteristics  <cit> . heavy reliance on phosphine has given rise to high-level heritable resistance in several grain insect pests, threatening the efficacy of phosphine  <cit> .

classical genetic studies on resistance to phosphine in two major grain insect pests, the rust red flour beetle, t. castaneum <cit>  and the lesser grain borer, rhyzopertha dominica <cit>  has confirmed that strong resistance is primarily conferred by two major genes, rph <dig> and rph <dig>  recently, a gene encoding a core metabolic enzyme, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase  has been identified as rph <dig> <cit>  in both r. dominica and t. castaneum and a free soil living nematode caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that resistance mechanisms involve altered oxidative metabolism with key respiratory enzymes. t. castaneum is a model organism for both genetic and developmental studies and the wealth of background genetic information with a recently published draft genome  <cit> , makes this insect an ideal system in which to test novel applications of next-generation sequencing to gene mapping. the present study aimed to  apply next generation sequencing methods to linkage mapping analyses by identifying the genomic location of genes conferring resistance to phosphine and  develop snp markers for understanding the biological and genetic aspects  of this trait on grain insect pests.

RESULTS
sequence analyses and snp discovery
two similar single pair inter-strain crosses , sics/sra and sics/srb  were established  and selected at different generational cohorts  for strong resistance. selected  and unselected progeny of these crosses were sequenced using the illumina gaiix platform and reads were mapped back to the t. castaneum genome assembly . the outline of the crossing schemes, selections, read mapping and snp calling criteria are described in more detail in materials and methods section. the illumina sequencing results for the generational selected and unselected pools are outlined in table  <dig> 

identification of candidate regions
in order to visualise regions linked to resistance, i.e. selected for homozygosity in phosphine exposed animals, we used a simple spreadsheet analysis of snp output data from clc genomics workbench. clc genomics workbench outputs each snp position, the primary variant for each position and the frequency of the primary variant, i.e. the ratio of the number of reads of the variant/total number of matching reads expressed as a percentage. for each generation’s  datasets, we combined the two snp output tables  for each chromosome into the same spreadsheet and put the primary variant frequencies in separate columns for each dataset. the data tables were then sorted by snp position, so that the two datasets were aligned in order along the chromosome/scaffold and then the primary variant frequencies were averaged over  <dig> cells in the spreadsheet for the selected and the unselected columns . the window size does not need to be fixed at  <dig>  but  <dig> cells gave us the best resolution on these datasets, with the least amount of artefacts caused by low coverage. the averages were then plotted graphically . for the smaller, unassigned scaffolds, we averaged  <dig> cells or less, depending on how many snps were called on each scaffold.

in this way, each plotted data point is an average of a virtual ‘dynamic window’, which changes in size on the corresponding chromosome sequence depending on the number of snps called. however the window at any point always covers the same region for both selected and unselected sets and moves down by one snp each time. the actual physical distance which the dynamic window covers is determined by the span encompassed by the  <dig> contiguous snps in the window. this averaging causes artefacts due to very low snp density, such as gaps in the scaffold sequence, or high snp density such as snp ‘clusters’, to be smoothed out by the analysis. the ideal window size cannot be calculated a priori, and is chosen empirically to reveal candidate regions which should be validated by detailed genetic analysis. the window size does not necessarily change with number of snps called, genome size or variant frequency. however, the length of the contig in fragmented genomes will affect the total number of snps called for a given contig, so smaller window sizes are preferable for shorter sequences. one consideration though, is that smaller window sizes are affected by the depth of coverage and can show up artefact differences between datasets that are caused by relatively low coverage. the depth of coverage can have large effects on individual snp frequencies and sometimes regions can have very low coverage which can produce an average of ‘zero’ or be appear to be homozygous in smaller windows. larger window sizes tend to ‘smooth out’ the analysis and account for snps that are missed. in general, there is an inverse relationship with the depth of sequencing coverage and the effective window size that will give reasonable resolution, i.e. the higher the depth of coverage, the better the estimation of snp frequency will be for any particular snp, and so the smaller the allowable window size.

the simple averaging method for genome wide analysis of snp allele frequencies shows major regions linked to phosphine resistance displayed as differential snp frequency caused by local regions of increased homozygosity in the selected dataset. the method does this without the aid of parentage assignment or other complex statistical calculation of association to the trait. the validity of the method is demonstrated by the fact that the regions found linked to resistance were confirmed in independent crosses from the same parental strains.

in the f <dig> data, four regions were found on chr <dig>  , two regions in chr <dig>  and one region in unassigned genomic scaffold  <dig> , hereafter referred to as uns- <dig>  , that constituted candidate regions associated with phosphine resistance in the t. castaneum genome . analysis of the f <dig> data revealed that on chr <dig>  only one of the four previously identified regions was nearly homozygous and therefore confirmed to be linked to resistance . in the case of chr <dig>  neither candidate region previously identified in the f <dig> data was confirmed in the f <dig> analysis, i.e. no increase in the frequency of homozygosity of snps was observed in either genomic region in animals that survived exposure to phosphine . however, a region of the previously identified contig uns- <dig> was retained as a candidate resistance locus . as a result, subsequent analysis was focused on region iii in chr <dig> and the candidate region in uns- <dig>  no other region of the genome showed an appreciable skew toward homozygosity of snps in selected versus unselected datasets of the f <dig> generation, indicating that no other resistance loci were present other than the locus on chr <dig> and the locus on uns- <dig> .

fine scale mapping
a subset of identified snps from chr <dig> and uns- <dig> that were homozygous in selected and heterozygous in unselected f <dig> datasets was chosen for further analysis . in addition, some chr <dig> snps were included to determine whether the uns- <dig> contig mapped to the candidate region of chr <dig> that had been identified previously in the f <dig> generation. these snps were selected based on the availability of restriction enzymes that could digest the sequence of one allele, but not the other. the local regions around these snps were amplified and tested for polymorphism using the appropriate restriction enzymes . in one case there was an informative size polymorphism found after amplification and so was included in the analysis. these markers were analysed in the p <dig> parents of the sics/sra cross, the f <dig> pair used to establish the genetically segregating line,  <dig> individuals from the f <dig> generation that survived exposure to  <dig>  mg l- <dig> phosphine and  <dig> individuals from the f <dig> generation that survived exposure to  <dig>  mg l- <dig> phosphine. the naming convention used in this study describes tc as an acronym for t. castaneum, followed by the type of marker used  for a pcr-based size polymorphism or c for caps followed by their approximate genomic location in kilo  or mega  bases.

for chr <dig>  we also tested the linkage to resistance of three of the four identified regions, in  <dig> selected strongly resistant f <dig> individuals of the cross sics/srb that had survived at a high dose of  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  linkage analysis of markers tcp8-777 k , tcc8- <dig>  m  and tcp8- <dig>  m  on selected strongly resistant f <dig> individuals showed that they exhibited >75% linkage to resistance. the marker tcp8-777 k had  <dig> recombinants, while the marker tcp8- <dig>  m had  <dig> recombinants, corresponding to estimated genetic distances of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm from the resistance locus respectively. however, only one locus, tcc8- <dig>  m, was absolutely linked to resistance in the f <dig> sics/srb cross and was the only one of the four regions that was identified in the f <dig> sequencing and confirmed further in fine scale mapping. this led us to conclude that there was only one locus on chr <dig>  in region iii, and that we had not identified multiple resistance loci on chr <dig> that were subsequently lost from the population between f <dig> and f <dig>  either due to drift or pleiotropic effects on fitness. it also shows that the low coverage of sequencing identifies linked regions across several cm in the f <dig> 

for mapping across the tightly linked chr <dig> candidate region identified in the f <dig>  snp markers were designed across the entire candidate region,  and tested in  <dig> strongly resistant f <dig> individuals. individuals that were non-recombinant for these snp markers across the tc_rph <dig> candidate region were excluded from the analysis. the results of fine scale mapping defined a candidate region for tc_rph <dig> from tcc8- <dig>  m to tcc8- <dig>  m . similarly, the marker tccu7- <dig>  k with no recombinants in  <dig> strongly resistant selected f <dig> individuals confirmed the close linkage to second resistance locus, tc_rph <dig>  on uns- <dig> .

positioning the unassigned scaffold  -  <dig> into chromosome 9
the loss of homozygosity seen on chr <dig> in the f <dig> dataset, compared to the observed homozygous peaks in f <dig> datasets, suggested that an error in genome sequence assembly had resulted in the omission of a segment of dna sequence from chr <dig> and this indicated that a resistance locus did indeed map to chr <dig>  in such a situation, the finer scale of the f <dig> genetic map would result in the loss of apparent linkage to chr <dig>  the fact that uns- <dig> did contain a resistance locus and was not assigned to any particular site in the genome indicated that it could actually map to the region of chr <dig> originally identified as a resistance locus in chr <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we mapped the relative genetic positions of three snp markers: tcc9- <dig>  m, tcp9- <dig>  m  and tccu7- <dig>  k, the marker for tc_rph <dig> locus  in  <dig> individuals of an f <dig> population of the sics/sra cross . we found that marker tccu7- <dig>  k is flanked by tcc9- <dig>  m and tcp9- <dig>  m, with map distances of  <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  cm , respectively, confirming our hypothesis that uns- <dig> is a part of chr <dig> , and most likely positioned in a gap of unknown size between two scaffolds , designated ‘new_gap6782’ .

candidate genes for phosphine resistance
the technique identified a target locus on the uns- <dig> scaffold, even though it was not assembled into the larger genome and was itself incomplete and had many gaps in the sequence. this scaffold contains  <dig> predicted genes, of which two  are actually the first and last exons of the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase  gene . we used our paired end sequencing data to de novo assemble the region containing dld, so that all the exons were represented in the genomic sequence. this assembled contig has been deposited into genbank . comparative genetic analysis has confirmed this gene as the phosphine resistance locus rph <dig> in t. castaneum, r. dominica and the nematode, caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . this was taken as a validation of the snp averaging technique.

the candidate region defined by markers tcc8- <dig>  m and tcc8- <dig>  m on chr <dig> contains  <dig> gene predictions . while some of these genes have strong homologies to genes of known function, the functions of most of them are either ill-defined or unknown. therefore further work is required to identify the resistance gene within this region.

epistatic interactions between the two resistance loci
the relative contribution to the resistance phenotype of the two loci tc_rph <dig> and tc_rph <dig> was estimated by genotyping surviving f <dig> individuals of the cross sics/sra  exposed to a range of phosphine concentrations. robust quantification of the relative strengths is difficult, but an estimate of the relative strengths of each genotype can be gleaned from table  <dig> using the range of values that the lc <dig>  is likely to fall between. the relative strength of the phenotype for each genotypic combination was ss  < sr  < rs  < rr . the lc <dig>  value for the fully sensitive  parental strain as calculated previously is  <dig>  mg l- <dig> <cit> . using this as a reference value we can estimate the individual contribution of tc_rph <dig> and tc_rph <dig>  as approximately  <dig> - <dig> × and  <dig> - <dig> ×, respectively. when homozygous for both resistance loci, the relative resistance ratio is >200×, demonstrating a strong synergistic interaction between the two loci.

relative fitness of tc_rph <dig> and tc_rph2
we estimated the change in frequency of resistance alleles in the absence of phosphine selection over  <dig> generations, from f <dig> to f <dig>  using the markers tcc8- <dig>  m  and tccu7- <dig>  k  and analysed deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium using chi-square test . the results showed a steady increase in the homozygous-resistant genotype tc_rph1rr in each generation from f <dig> to f <dig> , indicating that tc_rph <dig> may have a selective fitness advantage associated with phosphine resistance. in contrast, tc_rph <dig> showed a significant decrease in resistant homozygotes  coupled with a steady increase in sensitive homozygotes  over  <dig> generations  indicating a strong fitness cost associated with this resistance allele in the absence of selection.

discussion
finding single nucleotide changes that cause large phenotype changes in highly polymorphic genetic backgrounds is a formidable task. in the present study we have taken advantage of next-generation sequencing technology and the published reference genome sequences of t. castaneum to rapidly identify the genomic locations of phosphine resistance loci in t. castaneum. our results demonstrate the power of our simple averaging method to scan for local regions of loss of heterozygosity, which is preferable to standard linkage mapping for identifying gene regions responsible for well-defined traits in advanced intercrosses. the method does not rely on a high quality reference genome, high depth of sequence coverage, use of inbred strains or parentage assignment of snps. the whole genome including multiple unassigned scaffolds can be easily scanned to identify linked regions.

the simple averaging method also has advantages in that it can reduce artefacts caused by gaps in reference genome assemblies. large gaps that are included in the assembled sequence, as is the case for t. castaneum, can cause major problems for analyses that rely on defined physical distances, as there would appear to be no variants or genes within these gaps. variable snp density can also cause problems for analyses that rely on defined physical distances. our technique eliminates this problem by allowing the snps in the datasets to define the region to be averaged and how far the analysis window is shifted along the chromosome for each iteration, rather than a user-defined physical distance. this is easily visualised with spreadsheet software, such as excel™.

our analysis defined two genomic regions on chr <dig> and chr <dig>  containing loci responsible for high-level resistance, tc_rph <dig> and tc_rph <dig>  the results of f <dig> snp analysis showed discontinuous snp frequency signals in the candidate regions of both chr <dig> and chr <dig>  represented as separate peaks in the f <dig> snp frequency graphs  and suggested the possible disorientation or erroneous order of chromosomal scaffolds in the reference genome, either due to lack of genetic markers or low recombination in these regions in the crosses used to create the linkage map  <cit> . our inheritance analysis of selected snp markers from chr <dig>  chr <dig> and uns- <dig> on a f <dig> mapping population confirmed this and identified the location of uns- <dig> on chr <dig> . similar chromosomal sequence discrepancies on the t. castaneum reference genome especially on chr <dig> were observed by wang et al. <cit>  and the respective sequences were later rearranged to their proper location.

candidate genes
our next-generation sequencing and mapping results show that the major candidate resistance gene for tc_rph <dig> is on uns- <dig>  this scaffold contains the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase  gene, which was confirmed as a resistance locus using more traditional methods that required much greater effort and expense  <cit> . this demonstrates the validity, power and efficiency of the simple averaging method. all sequence scaffolds, including those not assigned to chromosomes can be scanned independently and rapidly for linkage to a trait. since more than 22 mb  of the t. castaneum genome sequence is still unassigned to genomic locations, this represents a powerful way of detecting linkage, even across smaller regions in fragmented genome assemblies.

at the tc_rph <dig> locus, the candidate gene list contains  <dig> predicted genes. however, none of them are associated with the same pathways as dld, consistent with the hypothesis of strongly resistant insects having at least two different mechanisms of resistance to phosphine  <cit> . although it is difficult to discuss the potential roles of each of the candidates, genes in the mapped interval are involved in lipid metabolism, chitin metabolism, membrane permeability and maintaining ion gradients. a resistance gene in any of these pathways would be consistent with previous observations on phosphine mode of action through oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and resistance through reduced uptake  <cit> .

epistatic interactions between the two resistance loci
we used markers tightly linked to resistance loci tc_rph <dig> and tc_rph <dig> to determine their relative phenotypic effects and genetic interactions in their homozygous and heterozygous states. in the genotype analysis, we showed that the resistance locus tc_rph <dig> exhibited a stronger phenotypic effect compared to tc_rph <dig>  both resistance loci are incompletely recessive but when both in a homozygous state they interact synergistically with resistance levels greater than 200×. this is a conservative estimate based on survival of the rph1rr/rph2rr genotype at doses up to  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  the highest dose tested. these results are in accordance with previous results showing synergistic interactions between resistance genes with resistance levels up to 431×, estimated using lc <dig> response values  <cit> . the synergism observed between the resistance alleles of t. castaneum resembles the synergistic interaction of rph <dig> and rph <dig> in r. dominica <cit> . these results are also consistent with the two gene model of high-level phosphine resistance seen in r. dominica <cit> .

pleiotropic effects on fitness
previous analysis  <cit>  on the relative change in the resistance phenotype in the absence of phosphine selection showed the existence of a possible fitness disadvantage in a t. castaneum population segregating for strong resistance alleles. in the present study, we observed a significant decrease in the frequency of the tc_rph2rr homozygous resistant genotype over  <dig> generations with a corresponding increase in heterozygote  and susceptible genotypes . this directly shows the presence of significant selective fitness disadvantage for homozygotes at the tc_rph <dig> locus. field population based fitness studies  <cit>  on phosphine resistant insect strains of r. dominca, t. castaneum, sitophilus oryzae, cryptolestes ferrugineus and oryzaephilus surinamensis reported the existence of biological fitness cost associated with phosphine resistance.

in contrast to tc_rph <dig>  we observed a significant increase in the frequency of the homozygous resistant allele of tc_rph <dig>  suggesting a selective fitness advantage of weakly resistant homozygotes  compared to susceptible genotypes. these results are consistent with previous fitness estimates on weakly resistant strains of t. castaneum, r. dominica and s. oryzae <cit>  and shows that there are fundamental differences between the genes that are associated with each resistance locus.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study used a whole genome resequencing approach and we validated our method of processing the sequences for rapid scanning of polymorphisms and identifying the candidate genes associated with phosphine resistance trait in t. castaneum by linkage mapping. although we have only validated the technique for a strongly selected and previously characterized trait, theoretically it is transferrable to nearly any species that has some genomic or transcriptomic reference data against which reads may be aligned, whose breeding may be manipulated for the generation of specific populations for linkage mapping. the detailed genotype analysis using identified snp markers demonstrated that high-level resistance in t. castaneum is a result of two synergistic genes, tc_rph <dig> and tc_rph <dig> with the latter having significant fitness cost. the fine-scale mapping analysis also defined the genomic regions containing these loci. the results show the validity of the technique and that it can be applied in cases where parental genotypes are unknown and in circumstances where the genome coverage conferred by sequencing is relatively low, which would often be the case for organisms with large genomes.
