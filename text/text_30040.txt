BACKGROUND
since the initial development of in vitro embryo production, the technique has been applied successfully to many species for clinical, commercial, and research purposes. in the early days, it was common practice to supplement culture media with serum to support embryo development in many species. but subsequently serum has been associated with fetal overgrowth in ruminants to give the so-called large offspring syndrome at birth  <cit> . in cattle, serum supplementation is still being used in many laboratories  probably because it increases blastocyst rates and generally gives more consistent results  <cit> . we recently adopted a robust serum-free culture system, consisting of synthetic oviduct fluid , bovine serum albumin , and insulin-transferrin-selenium , which yields comparable blastocyst rates  to media supplemented with serum  <cit> . however, bovine embryos produced in these serum-free conditions have a much lower hatching rate than embryos produced in serum-containing medium  <cit> . nevertheless, in many other aspects, the quality of the embryos produced in serum-free conditions is superior to that of embryos produced in the presence of serum. embryos produced in serum-free conditions showed increased freezability and, after transfer, the birthweight and incidence of abnormalities of the resulting calves was in line with that of in vivo derived embryos  <cit> . in addition, cattle embryos produced in serum-free conditions scored higher when using traditional parameters to evaluate embryo quality  <cit> . these quality parameters are based on blastocyst development, blastocyst cell number, ratios of inner cell mass  and trophectoderm cells, apoptotic cell ratios  <cit> , and also the gene expression pattern of a limited number of selected genes analyzed by qpcr  <cit> . the selection of only a few genes to check embryo quality was based on the fact that the evaluation of expression of all the genes in the genome by qpcr was a daunting task. however, this no longer represents an obstacle with recently developed rna sequencing techniques, which have proven to be a very powerful tool for evaluating and comparing the global gene expression pattern of even single cells, and therefore also of single embryos  <cit> . this new technique also allows the study of associated pathways that may ultimately be involved in affecting embryo quality.

we hypothesized that the similarities between embryos derived in vivo and those produced in serum-free culture conditions would also translate to the global gene expression pattern and, hence, embryos produced in serum-free conditions would resemble in vivo derived embryos more than embryos produced in the presence of serum. nevertheless, when evaluating the global gene expression pattern of embryos, their sex needs to be taken into account, since embryos of different sexes can respond differently to stress situations  <cit>  and this might be reflected in changes in their gene expression pattern.

therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect that in vitro production, either in serum-containing or serum-free conditions, might have on cattle embryos by comparing their global gene expression pattern to that of the gold standard; namely, embryos derived in vivo. also, to determine which in vitro condition produces more in vivo-like blastocysts. additionally, we wanted to assess the impact of in vitro culture on embryos depending on their sex.

to our knowledge, this is the first study that uses rna sequencing to evaluate the effect of in vitro embryo production, both in serum-containing and serum-free conditions, while at the same time taking embryonic sex into account. the results provide insight into the effects that different supplementations used for in vitro production may have on cattle embryos, show clearly how male and female embryos respond differently to suboptimal culture conditions, and offer valuable information on how to improve serum-free culture systems.

RESULTS
general expression profile of blastocysts produced by different culture conditions
the global gene expression pattern of  <dig> early blastocysts was analyzed using the illumina hiseq  <dig> system. eight blastocysts produced in vitro in serum-containing medium and eight other blastocysts produced in vitro in serum-free medium were compared with eight blastocysts derived in vivo, each blastocyst constituting one replicate. in addition, between three and five blastocysts of each sex were represented in every culture condition, to avoid the possibility that a sex bias could interfere with the interpretation of the results, as highlighted by bermejo-alvarez et al. who reported that the expression of about one third of the genes of a blastocyst are influenced by the sex  <cit> .

on average,  <dig> million reads were generated per embryo. of the total sequenced fragments,  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  %  could be mapped to the ensembl umd  <dig>  reference genome and, of these,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 92 %  were uniquely mapped to specific regions in the bovine genome . all the uniquely mapped fragments corresponded to annotated genes and of, an average of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 71 %  mapped to annotated exons; the remainder overlapped with annotated introns . only reads uniquely mapped to exons were considered in this study since focus was placed on the expression of known annotated genes. the higher prevalence of intronic reads  is not uncommon in bovine rnaseq experiments, when both random priming and/or oligo-dt primers are used to prepare libraries. for instance, chitwood et al.  <dig>  <cit>  reported up to 40 % intronic reads, graf et al.  <dig>  <cit>  around 30 %, and huang and khatib  <dig>  <cit>  some 20 %. moreover, these numbers are also in line with the 30–40 % of intronic reads reported by clontech laboratories, manufacturers of the smarter ultra low rna kit–hv used for library preparation . a number of factors could explain the presence of intronic reads 1) the presence of pre-mrna or unspliced rna; 2) alternatively spliced forms, where an entire or partial intron sequence in one transcript may serve as an exon in another transcript, and 3) the presence of antisense non-coding rnas overlapping the intronic regions; reads obtained with smarter ultra low kits are not strand-specific so that expression coming from each strand cannot be differentiated.table  <dig> summary of sequence read alignments to the reference genome

the distribution of total reads among different rna species per culture condition is depicted in fig. 1a/b. in summary, an average of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  of the total reads corresponded to protein-coding genes as a result of mrna enrichment performed during library preparation. the next most represented rna species was mitochondrial rrna to which only  <dig>  % of the reads corresponded. finally, the remaining  <dig>  % of the total reads was distributed among miscellaneous rnas, including pseudogenes and different non-coding rnas. the approximately  <dig> million total exon reads located in protein-coding genes corresponded to an average of  <dig>  <dig> protein coding transcripts, with very similar values between the different culture conditions . the total number of genes detected in the analysis ranged from  <dig> in a male embryo produced in serum-containing medium to  <dig>  <dig> in a male embryo produced in serum-free medium with an average of  <dig>  <dig> genes all round ; this represents almost 50 % of the  <dig>  <dig> protein-coding genes estimated to be present in the cattle genome  <cit> . the results were also in line with those of chitwood et al. using rna sequencing in individual blastocysts   <cit> . in contrast, they were lower than those found in other studies where  <dig>  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <dig> genes were detected  <cit> . this disparity might be due to technical differences such as: 1) the sequencing depth, which usually correlates with the number of genes detected, 2) the reads per kilobase per million  threshold used for normalization to determine when a gene is expressed and, 3) the alignment parameters that determine which reads were mapped and how non-uniquely mapping reads were dealt with.

to verify if the embryos produced within the same condition were more similar to each other than to those produced under different conditions, a hierarchical clustering and a principal component analysis  were performed . in the hierarchical clustering two clusters were formed thereby separating the embryos produced in the presence of serum from those embryos produced under the other two conditions. this cluster further divided into two minor clusters, which separated embryos derived in vivo from embryos produced in serum-free medium. within each minor cluster the embryos were grouped by sex, except in serum conditions where female and male embryos were mixed. in the pca, the first three principle components of the differentially expressed  genes were represented and, here, blastocysts produced under the same conditions were plotted together. in the pca, as had been already observed in the hierarchical clustering, embryos produced in serum-free conditions showed a pattern closer to in vivo derived embryos than to those produced in serum. it was also observed that the variability of gene expression within the embryos produced in serum-containing medium was greater than under the other two conditions, even though all the embryos selected for the study were early blastocysts with a score of  <dig> according to the international embryo transfer society  guidelines. a similar observation was made by cote et al. who compared  <dig> different in vitro culture conditions and in which embryos produced in the presence of serum  presented the largest variability in the pattern of gene expression among the replicates  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering and pca of differentially expressed genes among the different blastocysts. a heatmap including all the differentially expressed genes. the color spectrum, ranging from yellow through black to blue, represents tmm normalized expression values scaled between − <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating low to high expression. two main clusters were formed, with embryos cultured in the presence of serum in one cluster and in vivo derived and serum-free embryos in the other. b pca of the  <dig> embryos used in the study considering all the differentially expressed genes. each dot represents one blastocyst



the results of the hierarchical clustering and the pca confirmed the rigor of the study and showed that embryos produced under the same conditions were more similar to each other than to the rest. it also gave the first indication that the global gene expression pattern of embryos produced under serum-free conditions is more similar to embryos derived in vivo than those produced in vitro in the presence of serum.

gene expression deviations compared to in vivo derived embryos
the number of genes differentially expressed between in vitro produced, in vivo derived embryos, with a false discovery ratio  corrected p-value of < <dig>  and an absolute fold change  value of ≥ <dig>  were calculated. the aim was to determine if embryos produced in serum-free conditions showed a gene expression pattern closer to that of in vivo derived embryos than embryos produced in the presence of serum .table  <dig> differentially expressed up- and down-regulated genes among the groups compared

considering female and male embryos together, those produced in serum-free conditions were more similar to in vivo derived embryos, having five times fewer de genes  than embryos produced in serum-containing medium . remarkably, this large difference was even greater when only male embryos were compared. in male embryos produced in the presence of serum,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed while the equivalent figure was only  <dig> in male embryos produced in serum-free conditions. when only female embryos were compared with in vivo derived embryos, the number of de genes was drastically reduced for embryos produced in serum-containing medium, while it was maintained in embryos produced under serum-free conditions. nevertheless, the number of de genes in female embryos produced in serum-containing medium  was more than twice than that of female embryos produced in serum-free medium . these results indicated that serum supplementation had a greater impact on embryos than serum-free conditions, as was suggested by the clustering and pca, with the greatest impact affecting male embryos.

in murine embryos it was reported that, after exposure of morulae to heat stress in vitro for 24 h followed by subsequent transfer to pseudopregnant recipients, only 28 % of the fetuses obtained on day  <dig> were males, compared to 55 % in the control group  <cit> . also in humans, maternal stress during early pregnancy, or at the time of conception, led to a lower male–female ratio at term  <cit> . therefore, it seems that male embryos are more susceptible to suboptimal environmental conditions than female ones and, as demonstrated in the present study, this susceptibility might be reflected in their gene expression pattern. surprisingly, studies from previous decades repeatedly reported more male than female calves born after in vitro embryo production  , suggesting that more male than female embryos survive after in vitro production. to explain this apparent contradiction, it has been hypothesized that, in previous days, a bias towards more male calves was introduced by the practice of selecting fast cleaving embryos for transfer  <cit> . since male embryos develop faster than female embryos, more males would therefore have been transferred  <cit> .

not only male embryos produced in the presence of serum showed a more deviant transcriptome than their female counterparts compared to embryos derived in vivo; moreover, only  <dig> of their de genes were also differentially expressed in females. similarly, even though male and female embryos produced in serum-free conditions showed the same number of differentially expressed genes compared to embryos derived in vivo , only  <dig> of those genes were common in both sexes. this generates additional evidence to support the concept that male and female embryos respond differently to the environment. however, for the two conditions, the common de genes of both sexes were also equally up- or down-regulated. moreover,  <dig> out of the  <dig> common de genes in both sexes were down-regulated in in vivo derived embryos compared to those generated in serum-free medium. in the case of embryos generated in serum-containing medium,  <dig> out of  <dig> common genes were down-regulated in vivo.

interestingly, more de genes  were up-regulated in embryos produced in serum-free conditions compared with in vivo derived embryos, irrespective of whether all embryos, male, or female, were compared. surprisingly, more de genes were up-regulated in in vivo derived embryos compared to embryos produced in serum-containing medium when all and only the male embryos were considered. when all the embryos were considered, this tendency was reversed to give an fc ≥ <dig>  while when only male embryos were considered, the tendency was maintained for all fc. when female embryos were compared, the same number of de genes were up-regulated in both groups with fc ≥ <dig>  from fc ≥ <dig> onwards, more genes were up-regulated in embryos produced in serum-containing medium than in embryos derived in vivo .

in a comparable study, driver et al. reported that between embryos derived in vivo and those produced in vitro most of the de genes were up-regulated in vivo for all the fc. their study differed in a few important points from the present experiments. for example, they used a hybrid serum-ivm/serum-free-ivc in vitro conditions and in vivo derived embryos from non-superovulated cows, whereas we used superovulated cows. it is known that the superovulatory treatment can have an effect on the gene expression pattern of embryos recovered  <cit> . moreover, no replicates were performed in the study by driver et al., in which only one pool of in vivo derived and one pool of in vitro produced embryos were compared  <cit> . therefore, whether the differences in the results between driver et al. and the present study are due to the effect of the superovulation/in vitro production conditions on the gene expression pattern of the embryos, or to the lack of replicates in the driver et al. study needs to be investigated further.

genes differentially expressed between male and female embryos
only a few genes were differentially expressed when male and female embryos were compared under the same conditions . in in vivo derived embryos,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed. under in vitro conditions, the number of de genes between male and female embryos decreased dramatically to less than half, with only  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed in serum-containing and serum-free medium, respectively. of those, more genes  were up-regulated in females than in males under all conditions.

the low number of genes found to be differentially expressed between male and female embryos contrasts with previous reports. bermejo-alvarez et al. showed one third  of the expressed genes to be differentially expressed between male and female bovine blastocysts produced in serum-containing medium  <cit> . we found only  <dig> de genes between sexes in in vivo derived embryos and  <dig> in both serum-free and serum-containing in vitro conditions , considering in both studies fdr corrected p-value <  <dig>  and all fold changes. these differences may be due to the large sample size used in the bermejo-alvarez et al. study increasing the statistical power to detect smaller differences between groups. however, when only genes with absolute fold changes of ≥ <dig> were considered, the results of both studies became very similar. bermejo-alvarez et al. found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between male and female embryos produced in serum-containing medium, which corresponds almost exactly with the  <dig> genes that we found to be different according to sex in embryos produced in serum-containing medium. similarly, in our serum-free medium, the number of de genes between the sexes was  <dig>  only in embryos derived in vivo did we find a larger number of de genes . on the other hand, chitwood et al. found  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed between male and female bovine blastocysts  produced in vitro in a hybrid serum-free/serum containing culture system, in which serum was added to the medium after three days of culture  <cit> . however, in this last study, only one female embryo was compared with four male embryos. surprisingly, when comparing our present results with the list of de genes provided by bermejo-alvarez et al., the similarities are very few. for example, out of the  <dig> genes with common identity to ours,  <dig> of them  were common with those in in vivo derived embryos,  <dig>  were common with embryos produced in serum-free conditions and only  <dig> genes  with embryos produced in the presence of serum.

furthermore, the chromosomal distribution of the de genes between the sexes was studied . here, a χ <dig> analysis was performed to test for significant differences in chromosome location between genes up-regulated in each sex and expressed genes. the only chromosome that displayed significant differences between de genes up-regulated in female embryos  and expressed genes was the x chromosome under all conditions. it accounted for  <dig>  in vivo,  <dig>  in serum-containing, and  <dig>  % in serum-free conditions of the total up-regulated de genes in female embryos, while only  <dig>  in vivo,  <dig> in serum-containing, and  <dig>  % in serum-free embryos of the expressed transcripts were x-linked. this number of x-linked expressed transcripts is very similar to the  <dig>  % reported by bermejo-alvarez et al.  <cit> . however, the percentage of x-linked genes among the up-regulated de genes in female embryos was much higher in the present study than the level of  <dig>  % noted by bermejo-alvarez et al.  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to bermejo-alvarez et al., we found chromosome  <dig> to display significant differences between de genes up-regulated in male embryos and expressed genes under all conditions. in fact,  <dig>  for in vivo derived,  <dig>  for serum-containing, and  <dig>  % for serum-free of the total up-regulated de genes in male embryos belonged to chromosome  <dig>  while only  <dig>  % of the expressed transcripts were from chromosome  <dig> under all conditions. surprisingly, the x chromosome also displayed significant differences between de genes up-regulated in male embryos produced in serum-containing medium and expressed genes, with  <dig>  % of the de genes up-regulated in males being x-linked.fig.  <dig> chromosome distribution of the differentially expressed genes between male and female embryos. the bars represent the percentage of genes differentially expressed  up- regulated  and down- regulated  in males vs. females belonging to each chromosome in each of the three conditions studied



rna-seq data validation
rna-seq data was validated by rt-qpcr using  <dig> genes  in  <dig> individual early embryos per condition, performing a total of  <dig> comparisons. the values obtained were normalized with  <dig> stable reference genes . three genes, idi <dig>  hmgcs <dig>  and phgdh, showed higher expression in embryos produced in serum-free medium compared to those derived in vivo, with averages of  <dig> -, <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold differences, respectively, using rna-seq and  <dig> - ,  <dig> -, and  <dig> - fold differences, respectively, when measured using rt-qpcr, . hmgcs <dig> showed higher expression in embryos produced in serum-containing medium than in those derived in vivo, with an average of  <dig> -fold differences when using rna-seq and  <dig> -fold differences when measuring by rt-qpcr . finally, sfn showed higher expression in embryos derived in vivo compared to those produced in serum-containing medium, with an average of  <dig> -fold differences using rna-seq, and  <dig> -fold differences when measuring with rt-qpcr . the rest of the comparisons did not show significant differences, either when analyzed by rna-seq, or by rt-qpcr, . therefore, these  <dig> genes showed similar patterns of mrna abundance in rna-seq and rt-qpcr.

functional analysis
the functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes between the groups was performed using the cytoscape  <dig> . <dig> software and considering significant only annotations with a benjamini-hochberg corrected p-value of < <dig> .

when the gene ontology  of the de between all the embryos produced in serum-containing medium and all the embryos derived in vivo was examined,  <dig> biological processes, such as “lipid metabolic process” and “dna repair” ,  <dig> molecular functions, such as “anion binding” and “actin binding,” and  <dig> cellular components were over-represented . additionally,  <dig> kegg pathways, including “lysosome” and “metabolic pathways” were over-represented. the vast majority of the genes included in the go terms and kegg pathways were up-regulated in in vivo derived embryos and only two biological processes  and two cellular components  had more genes up-regulated in embryos produced in serum-containing medium than in in vivo derived embryos. a reduced number of terms and pathways were over-represented when only male embryos were taken into account. in particular,  <dig> biological processes ,  <dig> molecular functions,  <dig> cellular components, and  <dig> kegg pathways were over-represented, most of them in common with the previous comparison, but with a few differences such as “alpha-amino acid metabolic process” biological process, “enzyme binding” molecular function, “mitochondrion” cellular component, and “cysteine and methionine metabolism” kegg pathway . when only female embryos were considered,  <dig> biological processes ,  <dig> molecular functions, and “mitochondrial matrix” cellular component were over-represented . surprisingly, only “oxidoreductase activity, acting on ch-oh group of donors” molecular function was common in the comparison of all the embryos. when only male or female embryos were considered, most of the terms and all the pathways had more genes up-regulated in in vivo derived embryos.fig.  <dig> go biological processes enriched in genes differentially expressed in in vivo vs. serum. enriched go biological processes with benjamini-hochberg corrected p-value < <dig> , genes per term/pathway ≥ <dig>  goterm levels 3– <dig>  in the genes differentially expressed  in,  all the embryos,  only male embryos and,  only female embryos. the analysis was performed with the cluego  <dig> . <dig> plugin of the cytoscape  <dig> . <dig>  the size of the nodules represents their significance; orange nodules are only composed of genes up-regulated in vivo, grey nodules are composed of at least  <dig> genes up- and  <dig> genes down-regulated in vivo



on the other hand, the study of the gene ontology of the de genes between all the embryos produced in serum-free medium and all the embryos derived in vivo, led to  <dig> molecular functions “oxidoreductase activity, acting on the ch-oh group of donors, nad or nadp as acceptor” and “tetrapyrrole binding”, and  <dig> biological processes being over-represented. these biological processes were related, among other things, to cholesterol and amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis . furthermore,  <dig> kegg pathways, such as the “p <dig> signaling pathway” and “glycine, serine, threonine metabolism” were also over-represented . if only male embryos were considered,  <dig> biological processes mostly common to the previous comparison , two molecular functions and two kegg pathways were over-represented . finally, when only the female embryos were considered,  <dig> biological process  and one kegg pathway  were over-represented, all in common with the ones over-represented when all the embryos were considered . in contrast to the situation observed when comparing in vivo-derived embryos with those produced in vitro in the presence of serum, all the go biological processes and kegg pathways contained mostly, or even only, genes down-regulated in in vivo-derived embryos, when compared to embryos produced in serum-free medium.fig.  <dig> go biological processes enriched in genes differentially expressed in the in vivo derived embryos vs. those cultured in serum-free medium. enriched go biological processes with a benjamini-hochberg corrected p-value of < <dig> , genes per term/pathway ≥ <dig>  goterm levels 3– <dig>  in the genes differentially expressed  in,  all the embryos,  male embryos only and,  female embryos only. the analysis was done with the cluego  <dig> . <dig> plugin of the cytoscape  <dig> . <dig>  the size of the nodules represents their significance; blue nodules are composed only of genes down-regulated in vivo, grey nodules are composed of at least  <dig> genes up- and  <dig> genes down-regulated in vivo



in the mouse, it has been reported that during the first days of pregnancy, the mother supplies most of the cholesterol needed by the embryo  <cit> . therefore, embryos derived in vivo will not have to synthetize cholesterol, in contrast to embryos produced in vitro in serum-free medium. embryos produced in vitro in the presence of serum do not show over-representation of these pathways, indicating that serum supplementation during embryo culture provides the lipids necessary for development. in addition, the over-representation of cholesterol biosynthesis and sterol synthesis in cattle embryos produced in vitro  compared to in vivo derived embryos was described previously by driver et al.  <cit> . these results also suggest that the over expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis depends on the embryonic culture conditions, but is independent of the oocyte maturation conditions used, indicating that the oocytes matured in the presence of serum do not accumulate all the lipids needed for their development. interestingly, biological processes involved in “dna repair,” the “p <dig> signaling pathway” and “response to reactive oxygen species” had more genes up-regulated in embryos produced in vitro than embryos derived in vivo. this indicates that in vitro production is a source of stress for embryos regardless of culture conditions.

no functional categories were over-represented when male and female embryos were compared.

CONCLUSIONS
embryos produced under serum-free conditions showed gene expression patterns that were more similar to those derived in vivo than embryos produced in vitro in the presence of serum. this was true regardless of the sex of the embryos. importantly, male embryos were most affected by suboptimal in vitro conditions,  and they showed a more deviant gene expression pattern than their female counterparts. embryos produced in the presence of serum showed reduced expression of genes related to small molecule metabolism, and an enhanced expression of genes related to dna repair. however, embryos produced under serum-free conditions had a deviant lipid and amino acid metabolism gene expression pattern compared to in vivo derived embryos, indicating that the serum-free conditions used in this study require further optimization to fulfill the needs of the embryo during preimplantation development.

all the results of this study provide evidence for the strong and abnormal effects of adding serum to embryo culture medium. therefore, the formulation of the culture media should move towards serum-free supplementations, even for research purposes, since experiments performed on embryos produced in the presence of serum may lead to erroneous conclusions.
