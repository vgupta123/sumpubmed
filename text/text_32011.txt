BACKGROUND
brain evolution is characterized by changes in size, structural complexity and connectivity of the central nervous system , commonly referred to as mosaic evolution
 <cit> . recently, with the accumulation of functional genomic studies, evolution of phenotypes has been linked to evolution of gene expression
 including for brain evolution
 <cit> . as in any organismal tissue, changes in gene expression will affect both development and physiology of the cns
 <cit> . the molecular basis of divergent brain function has been previously studied at the level of individual genes. previous reports on strain or species variation in molecular brain function include neuropeptides and their receptor structure and distribution
 <cit>  the protein levels of camk <dig>  mapk, creb, and bdnf
 <cit> , and other genes involved in development
 <cit> . but, in addition, neurons are highly polarized cells whose function is modulated through subcellular localization of mrna and other molecules in its neurites. local translation of the dendritic mrna has been postulated to play important role in synaptic plasticity
 and perturbation of dendritic localization and translation can have serious effects at the cellular and organismal level, leading to neurological diseases such as fragile x syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, autism, among others
. these and many other studies clearly show that dendritic localization of mrna is critical to cns function. however, recent studies have shown that hundreds or even thousands of different mrna are found in the dendrites of neurons
 <cit> ; therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the evolution of rodent brains may involve not only divergences in general gene expression but also changes in the levels of dendritic localization of mrna within individual neurons.

in this work, we characterize the dendritic transcriptome of mouse and rat hippocampal neurons to assess whether a significant difference exists in these two closely related species. we found a high degree of evolutionary divergence in the dendritic transcriptome of mouse and rat, a divergence greater than the one seen in other organs or whole brain tissues. additional analysis reveals that many genes previously described to have roles in synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative disorders show significantly different levels of expression between mouse and rat dendrites. we propose that the neuronal architectures of relatively closely related mammalian species might show substantial evolutionary diversification at the subcellular level. our results suggest that brain evolution between closely related species might involve not only anatomical differences at the morphological level but also rna-mediated subcellular differences in synaptic compartments of individual neurons.

RESULTS
microarray analysis shows a high degree of divergence between mouse and rat dendritic transcriptomes
to assess neuronal dendrite expression divergence between mice and rats, we used the affymetrix array platform to assay the transcriptomes of micro-dissected individual dendrites of hippocampal neurons in dispersed primary cell cultures from sprague–dawley rat , c57bl/ <dig> mouse , and balb/c mouse . for each species we used species-specific array platforms available from affymetrix. the detailed procedure of samples preparation is provided in the methods section and the different steps in the collection of dendrites are illustrated in figure 
1a.figure  <dig>

for the pyramidal neurons collected in this study we cannot morphologically distinguish axons from dendrites. our sample collections typically have 5% axonal rna  but preponderance of the rna is expected to be derived from the dendrites and we will use the term dendritic transcriptome with this caveat. all replicate samples from the two mouse strains and the rat strain show good concordance with average pair-wise pearson’s correlation of  <dig> . in addition, we also validated our rna amplification protocol with a series of synthetic dilution and replicate amplification experiments and obtained an average correlation of  <dig>  across all of our amplification controls .

to compare expressed genes between rat and mouse, we constructed a blast reciprocal-best-hit homology map , yielding  <dig>  conservatively mapped mouse-rat orthologs . using a t-test on normalized log array expression values with a fdr  of  <dig> %, we found  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes with significant differential dendritic expression levels between rat and the c57bl/ <dig> mouse. we also compared rat dendritic transcriptome with five samples of mouse balb/c strain and found  <dig> genes significantly differentially expressed at the fdr level of  <dig> %. the smaller numbers than c57bl/ <dig> comparison may be due to lower sample size of balb/c  versus c57bl/ <dig> . in contrast, a within-species comparison between the c57bl/ <dig> and balb/c mouse strains yielded only  <dig> significantly different genes . the affymetrix mouse array platform is designed based on c57/bl <dig> and balb/c array results may be influenced by the presence of snps or indels. we examined the snps between c57/bl <dig> and balb/c genomes for sequence divergence of these  <dig> significantly different genes and also for a set of  <dig> most similarly expressed genes. we found a total of  <dig> snps in the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes and  <dig> snps in the  <dig> most similarly expressed genes .

in order to compare the two transcriptomes more conservatively using highly expressed genes, we computed the median rank of the expression levels across the biological replicates of the ortholog-mappable genes for each species and then assessed the overlap in gene identity of the top 5% of the highly expressed set . at this broad level, a small fraction is shared between the top 5% expressed genes in mouse and rat, with ~19%  genes for c57/bl <dig> and ~ <dig> %  genes for balb/c respectively . the same comparison between c57bl/ <dig> and balb/c mice yields an overlap of 58% , showing that the expression divergence is a function of evolutionary distance of the strains and species .

both rna and proteins show inter-species differences in dendritic localization
to illustrate examples of localization divergence, we selected nine ortholog pairs that show varying differences in dendritic array expression levels in rats and mice and carried out mrna in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry assays of the spatial expression patterns of both rna and proteins on cultured sprague–dawley rat and c57bl/ <dig> mouse cortical neurons . the images and probe intensity levels of the rna probes were quantified via manual tracing of transects from soma to distal dendrites using a custom imaging software . for the probes shown in figure 
 <dig>  the probes sfrs <dig>  arhgdia, hnrpk all showed significantly higher dendrite soma ratio for mouse vs rat at  <dig>  vs  <dig>  ,  <dig>  vs  <dig>  , and  <dig>  vs  <dig>  , respectively. probes zfp <dig>  commd <dig>  and rps <dig> showed lower dendrite soma ratios for mouse vs rat at  <dig>  vs  <dig>  ,  <dig>  vs  <dig>  , and  <dig>  vs  <dig>  , respectively. however, the probe for zfp410’s difference was not significant at the customary  <dig>  level. the probes uba <dig>  olfm <dig>  and h2afz showed no significant difference in dendrite soma ratio for mouse vs rat at  <dig>  vs  <dig>  ,  <dig>  vs  <dig>  , and  <dig>  vs  <dig>  , respectively. the pixel level quantification from soma to distal dendrites were normalized by dividing by the soma intensity to yield a distance dependent dendrite/soma ratio function, which also shows species-specific differences in normalized dendritic intensity . immunocytochemistry assays of the proteins of these transcripts were only carried out for a limited number of slides but the overall images qualitatively recapitulated the spatial patterns of the rna . the nine candidates selected here are involved in cellular functions critical for neuronal development and synaptic plasticity: sfrs <dig> is known for regulating alternative splicing
 <cit>  and hnrpk has been reported to influence pre-mrna processing and to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm
 <cit> . arhghia, rps <dig> and olfm <dig> are associated with neurons development, differentiation and axonogenesis
. zfp <dig>  commd <dig>  uba <dig> and h2afz are related to gene expression regulation
. the differential localization of these transcripts and proteins could be a species-specific signature stressing their more or less functional importance in one species versus the other. for example, sfrs <dig> showed high signal in the cell soma of both the mouse and the rat neurons, but high dendritic signal only in the mouse neuron . in contrast, zfp <dig> showed high dendritic signal in rat but not mouse . finally, olfm <dig> showed consistently high dendritic signal in both mouse and rat . cortical neurons may have different dendritic transcriptomes from hippocampal neurons but tissue level transcriptomes show greater than  <dig>  correlation . we note that the in situ study here is not meant to validate the array results but to demonstrate the spatial patterns of rna and proteins that are divergent and concordant in the dendrites of cns neurons in these two species.figure  <dig>

dendritic transcriptomes are more divergent than other tissues
to place the above transcriptome comparisons in context, we analyzed the expression data for hippocampus and heart tissue of the sprague–dawley rat and c57bl/ <dig> mouse  using the same affymetrix array platforms used for the dendrite transcriptome analysis . as previously, we used the  <dig>  conservatively mapped mouse-rat orthologs to perform a t-test on the normalized array expression values . in contrast with the above dendrite transcriptome results, we found a lower number of genes significantly different between rat and mouse, with  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes and  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes for the hippocampus and heart respectively . the dendrite array samples have a lower standard deviation in gene expression compared to the tissues tissue, which might be due to their more homogeneous origin from mechanical dissection and dispersed cell culture ; therefore the dendritic arrays may have greater power to detect significant species differences. to correct for this possibility, we examined a subset of the genes for the three rna pools  with a similar range of standard deviation . the number of genes significantly different between rat and mouse was still higher in dendrites  than in hippocampus or heart .

valor et al. demonstrated significant variations in gene expression of mouse hippocampal neurons as a function of culture dates
 <cit> . to examine these effects, we carried out a comparison of mouse dendritic transcriptomes from primary neurons cultures of days in vitro   <dig> and div  <dig> . at the same fdr  <dig> % level, we only found  <dig> out of  <dig> probe significantly different between the two culture dates. this may be partly due to the small sample size and therefore we relaxed the fdr rates to 1% and found  <dig> probe difference, which is ~ <dig> % of the probes in contrast to the 53% of homologous probe sets different at  <dig> % fdr level for between species comparison.

to augment our tissue data and for a larger scale comparison between dendrites and tissue samples, we used a public dataset for  <dig> different organs/tissues of the sprague–dawley rat and c57bl/ <dig> mouse available from the genomics institute of the novartis research foundation 
 <cit> . the lack of replicates in the gnf samples did not allow us to perform a t-test, but instead we computed the overlap percentage of the top 5% expressed genes for each of the  <dig> different tissue arrays between the two species . figure 
 <dig> shows a heatmap of the overlap percentages within each species across the tissues  as well as between species across the tissues . the last row and column of each of the heatmaps show the overlap percentages for the dendritic transcriptome compared with the other tissues. the diagonal elements in figure 
5c show the overlap percentages of homologous tissues across the two species and the off-diagonal elements show the overlap percentages of the non-homologous tissues.figure  <dig>

tissues from brain anatomical regions show more similar gene expression compared to tissues from other organs both within and across the species. however, the dendritic transcriptome shows greater divergence in both rat and mouse than any other tissue – even greater than non-homologous tissue comparisons. the fraction of overlap between the top 5% expressed ortholog-mappable genes of the mouse and rat dendritic transcriptomes is significantly different from the fraction of overlap of the homologous tissues . interestingly almost 85% of the genes in the top 5% overlap fraction of the rat and mouse hippocampus tissue, are not present in the top 5% overlap fraction for the dendritic transcriptomes. the gnf data used here lacks replication and does not represent only the neuronal subset, which may be more divergent than the heterogeneous cell population represented by the tissue. we also note that our dendritic transcriptome may have soma rna contamination, which if the hippocampal neurons are more divergent at the whole cell level may distort the dendrite specific inference. with these caveats in mind, our data potentially suggests post-transcriptional mechanisms that modulate dendritic localization may play a partial role in observed dendritic transcriptome divergence.

of special note in figure 
 <dig> are the patterns related to the rat prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus. both of these tissues show higher divergence within rat non-homologous tissue comparisons as well as between homologous rat-mouse comparisons. the gnf dataset indicates that the prefrontal cortex is from a 20-week old rat while the hypothalamus is from a 16-week old rat. all other tissues in both rat and mouse are reported to be collected from 10-week old animals. despite the developmental timing disparities between these samples, the overlap percentages are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively for the prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus, which is still significantly higher than for the overlap between dendritic transcriptomes. our dendritic samples were extracted from developmentally matched time points . homologous developmental points can be difficult to define but our dendritic comparisons show significantly greater divergence than the tissue data, which ranges between 10– <dig> week old animals. additionally, in order to assess potential disparities in gene expression due to developmental differences, we performed a comparison between hippocampus and heart tissues from rat and mouse pup  and adult  animals. we found average pairwise correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rat adult vs. pup hippocampus and heart, respectively and average correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mouse adult vs. pup hippocampus and heart, respectively. additionally a t-test analysis at the same stringent level of fdr < <dig> % did not show any significant difference within these animal’s adult versus pup samples except in the mouse hippocampus where one gene had a significantly different level of expression. both the gnf data and our own data suggest that developmental timing differences has minimal effects on the magnitude of dendritic transcriptome divergence.

to compare the overlap in highly expressed genes at other ranks than top 5%, we also computed the number of common genes at each k rank  for all homologous tissue and dendritic transcriptomes for the rat and c57bl/ <dig> mouse. figure 
 <dig> shows the percent overlap in gene identity between the two species as a function of rat expression rank k up to  <dig> for the average of all gnf tissues and our dendritic transcriptome. for the tissue average curve we also computed the 95% bonferroni corrected confidence interval as well as the min and max of the tissue overlap percentages. we note that the tissue confidence interval does not intersect the dendrite curve at any rank—the dendrite confidence interval is necessarily smaller that the tissue confidence interval  and therefore the fraction of gene overlap is significantly different between dendrites and tissues at all rank .figure  <dig>

we computed the rates of molecular evolution between rat and mouse dendritic genes for synonymous changes , non-synonymous changes , and 5′ and 3′ untranslated region  non-coding changes. out of the  <dig>  mappable homologous genes, we computed these rates for  <dig>  genes that were longer than  <dig> amino acids with non-degenerate estimates. overall rates of ks, ka, and ka/ks were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  , which is similar to the rates reported previously
 <cit> . we tested whether there was any significant difference in rates of molecular evolution between the dendritic expression divergent genes  and non-divergent genes. using non-parametric kruskal-wallis test
 <cit> , we found no significant difference in ks, ka, and ka/ks at p =  <dig>  level across the divergent and non-divergent gene groups. thus, we did not find evidence of coding sequence divergence driven by differential localization.

in sum, the dendritic transcriptome of the mouse and rat showed a significantly greater evolutionary divergence than that for both our own tissue data and the public tissue data.

functional annotation of divergently localized dendritic genes
as a first step toward understanding effectors of dendritic physiology, we first examined if the differentially expressed dendritic genes between the two species are enriched in a particular gene ontology  functional category . using the  <dig>  homologous genes as the background against the  <dig> significantly divergent genes, we found the category of translation  and hindbrain development  as the enriched categories passing a fdr 5% threshold, suggesting perhaps enhanced divergence of components related to localized translation dynamics in the dendrites . we next examined the functionally enriched categories or specific families of genes for the top  <dig> expressed dendritic genes within each species separately. a go analysis of these dendritic genes against the genomic background of respective species highlighted categories such as localization, neurogenesis, and ribosomal components that are enriched in both species as being dendritically localized . however, even within shared go categories between these two species, there is expression divergence within gene families, suggesting potential for species-specific sub-functionalization. for instance within the rab family, which is involved in vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter release, rab <dig> and rab <dig> are present in the top  <dig> mouse dendritic transcripts while rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> are present in the top  <dig> rat dendritic transcripts. several genes coding for calcium-sensitive proteins showed gene expression divergence in the dendrites but not in the hippocampus and heart tissues samples , including synaptotagmins  and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases  that may modulate calcium microenvironment in the dendrites
 <cit> . similarly, among the potassium channel genes  previously suggested as relevant for neuronal excitability, almost one third of the genes showed a significant difference in dendritic expression between the two species . in addition, potassium channel auxiliary subunits beta <dig> and beta <dig>  which regulate potassium channels using different mechanisms
 <cit> , are also differentially expressed with beta <dig> being higher in rat and beta <dig> being higher in mouse. it has been proposed that the beta subunits can function as oxidoreductases that can link the redox state of the dendrites to the electrical activity of the cell
 <cit> . the netrin receptor dcc, which has been implicated in spatial control of translation
 <cit>  and in modulation of synaptic plasticity, also shows significant difference in dendrites expression but not in tissue expression . a more detailed listing of the pattern of differential expression of functionally important genes is provided in table 
 <dig>  this list consists of genes that are either in the top 5% for all sprague–dawley rat, c57bl/ <dig> mouse and balb/c mouse or are highly variable across the three samples . in additional file
5: table s <dig> shows the complete list of receptors and synaptic genes categorized by a finer scale of rank expression. in sum, many genes previously hypothesized to be involved in neuronal function show significant pattern of species divergence in their dendritic expression, suggesting that neurons from these two species may also diverge in their physiological responses.table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we used micro-dissected and mechanically isolated individual dendrite preparations to assay the whole transcriptomes of dendritically localized mrna from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. our results show that the dendritic transcriptome is significantly more diverged in these two species than for other tissue- and organ-level transcriptomes. the level of divergence is considerably greater than that expected from amplification of rna as shown by our in vitro dilution and amplification control studies . nevertheless we believe there are two important cautionary points to keep in mind prior to interpreting our results. first, we employed species-specific array platforms for our expression comparison. these platforms use different probe design for each homologous gene and therefore it is difficult to exclude array-dependent bias. we attempted to account for experimental platform problems by comparing the dendritic results to whole tissue rna results using the same species-specific platforms; therefore, both comparisons would include any platform-dependent biases. in addition, we employed rank-based methods to more robustly compare expression divergence of different tissues and the dendrites. nevertheless, cross-species comparison of quantitative levels of rna remains a difficult experimental problem. second, because of the necessity of using low-density cell culture to individually dissect the dendrites, our samples consisted of ex vivo individual cells in non-natural context. any changes in a cell’s environment is likely to induce expression differences and therefore it is possible that primary cell culture conditions may enhance the appearance of expression divergence of the dendrites. the culture conditions we used are standard conditions under which other functional studies such as electrophysiology, neuronal growth and differentiation, etc. are carried out. nevertheless, we cannot rule out that in vivo dendritic transcriptome may be less divergent that what we observed.

our results suggest unusually large number of significantly differentially expressed genes in the dendritic transcriptome of mice and rats. we note some additional factors that can affect expression studies. first, it is difficult to match the developmental stages of different species of animals, which will impact differences in dynamical trait like gene expression. we stated above that the gnf data includes a comparison of 16-week and 20-week old rat tissues with 10-week old mouse tissues and we also included a comparison of 1-week old and 10-week old tissue expression data. our dendritic transcriptome results exceed the divergence seen in these developmentally mismatched tissues. even with developmentally matched samples, for primary cell cultures, culture conditions and days in vitro  also affect the dynamics of gene expression as shown in
 <cit> . for div, our mouse and rat samples were matched according to standard practice
 <cit> , but as noted by valor et al. 
 <cit> , a rapid change in expression dynamics as a function of div may magnify as small mismatch of the species with respect to cell development in culture. our preliminary data with div  <dig> and div  <dig> mouse dendritic transcriptomes suggest that the transcriptome divergence as a function of div is not as great as that seen across mouse-rat comparison, at least at the level of statistical significance used above. finally, culture conditions and stimulations can affect the dendritic transcriptome. the culture conditions for the two species’ cells were identical but the cells may have unique responses to identical conditions that might affect the dendritic transcriptome, which we cannot rule out. the dendritic transcriptome may change dynamically with respect to different stimuli and context but previous work on conditioning, gene deletions, and drug treatment show differential expression effect sizes of less than  <dig>  genes
. in sum, all of the above factors may affect the degree of observed dendritic transcriptome divergence between mice and rats but the total number of significantly different genes largely exceeds the possible effect sizes of these confounding factors.

in our study, nearly twice the numbers of highly expressed genes showed significant divergence in subcellular localization compared to tissue level expression. but, as we show above, we did not find significant differences in the pattern of molecular sequence evolution for the class of differentially expressed genes. gene expression is modulated by trans-factors and upstream and downstream non-coding sequences and therefore the molecular evolution of genic sequences need not be coupled to expression evolution. this is especially true for subcellular localization that involves post-transcriptional processes. part of observed differences in the dendritic transcriptome may involve selective neutral phenotypic divergence, either in passive diffusion processes  or in species-specific translocation mechanisms. if gene expression traits diverge with neutral drift, it is not clear why there might be a larger degree of drift in subcellular compartments such as the dendrites compared to larger scale samples. one possibility is that fitness consequence of deviation in molecular process at smaller scales can be ameliorated by homeostatic mechanisms at larger scales. we also note that evolutionary changes in post-transcriptional processes might have less pleiotropic effects, which may mediate rapid divergence. rapid divergence of subcellular localization may be mediated by the fact that post-transcriptional regulation generally has limited negative epistatic effects with transcriptional regulation. that is, changes in cis motifs that modulate localization can have isolated effects independent of other functions of the mrna. thus, there may be more potential for neutral evolution of post-transcriptional processes. we note that even if the dendritic transcriptome variation is functionally neutral, neutral variation can provide the substrate for rapid adaptive evolution under a different selective regime by presenting segregating variation. the high level of divergence detected here in the dendritic transcriptome of rats and mice might suggest the existence of species-specific rna subcellular localization mechanisms. further work is needed to determine the cis-elements involved in the targeting for individual transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we hypothesize that evolutionary divergence of mammals in general and brain evolution in specific, involves not only developmental changes in tissue and morphology, but also divergence in both functional and neutral molecular phenotype of homologous cells. finally, our results also highlight that the choice of an animal model might affect translational applications when examining detailed molecular mechanisms such as sub-cellular molecular physiology.
