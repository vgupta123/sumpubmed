BACKGROUND
prokaryotic mobile elements such as plasmids play key roles in biological research as molecular biological vectors. more importantly, they have contributed substantially to genome evolution throughout biological history  <cit> . in addition, various studies have demonstrated the importance of horizontal transfer of genes via mobile elements, for example in virulence  <cit> , adaptation  <cit>  and most well-known in conferring antibiotic resistance  <cit> .

the genome signature, which is the set of dinucleotide relative abundance values  <cit> , is one of the parameters available to identify putative horizontally transferred dna. the genome signature is typical for a given bacterial genome and similar between closely related genomes. these host-specific patterns are thought to result from differences in the replication and/or mismatch repair systems between species  <cit> . due to its species-specific nature, this signature enables easy detection of anomalous genomic regions  <cit> . recently, we developed an application based on the genome signature that allows the comparison of the genome signature of a sequence as small as  <dig> kbp with that of a sequenced genome  <cit> .

most plasmids depend on the host replication machinery and possess partitioning genes. these properties confine plasmids to a limited number of hosts, yielding a close and presumably stable relationship between plasmid and host. genome signature compatibility between a plasmid and its host could indicate a long-term association, for example via strict vertical transmission, whereas high genomic dissimilarity scores between the plasmid and the host could indicate separate evolutionary histories. although wong and co-workers have previously suggested that plasmids are more dissimilar from chromosomes than chromosomes from the same strain amongst each other, the extent of their analysis was limited  <cit> . we therefore analyzed genome signature dissimilarities of  <dig> plasmid sequences with representative host chromosome sequences.

RESULTS
sequence length independence genome signature comparison between a plasmid and the genome of its host
genome signature dissimilarity scores  are calculated as described previously  <cit> , with δ* being the average absolute dinucleotide relative abundance difference . for this analysis, the relevant chromosome sequence, in fig.  <dig> that of borrelia burgdorferi b <dig>  is divided in non-overlapping fragments of identical length as the b. burgdorferi b <dig> plasmid lp <dig>  the distribution of the δ* scores between these genomic fragments and the host genome sequence are visualised in a frequency distribution plot, with the δ* between plasmid and host indicated as a vertical line . for plasmid lp <dig> we find a high δ* value of  <dig> , and from the position of this δ* value in the distribution it is deduced that 98% of the b. burgdorferi b <dig> chromosomal fragments have a lower δ* value than that of plasmid lp <dig> . a similar procedure to compare the gc content of plasmid lp <dig> to that of the chromosome indicates that only 1% of the chromosomal fragments have a lower gc content than plasmid lp <dig> . these results indicate a substantial compositional difference between plasmid lp <dig> and the genome of b. burgdorferi b <dig> this approach allows us to compare the genome signature differences and gc content deviations between different plasmid/host genomic fragment combinations from entries of the plasmid genome database  <cit> .

genome signature comparison between plasmids and the sequenced genome of their host
analyses of the δ* values between  <dig> plasmids and their corresponding host strains  show that in most instances the δ* between plasmid and the chromosome is higher than that of the bulk of the genomic fragments . additionally, most of the plasmids have a lower gc content than the bulk of the chromosomal fragments of their respective hosts. together these results indicate that the majority of plasmids have a dna composition dissimilar to that of their corresponding host chromosome.

genome signature comparisons between plasmids and genomes of their host and relatives there off
for  <dig> prokaryotic species, of which plasmids are available in the plasmid genome database, different strains of the same species have been sequenced. the genome sequences of the strains belonging to the same species are compared to each other and the absolute δ* between these related chromosomes are depicted in table  <dig>  in most cases, δ* values between the chromosome sequences of related strains within species are low , except for buchnera aphidicola and pseudomonas syringae . δ* values between  <dig> plasmids and chromosome sequences of the same  host species are comparable , again except for b. aphidicola and p. syringae plasmids. this legitimizes the comparison of the nucleotide composition of plasmids, of which the host genome has not been sequenced, with that of a genome sequence of a representative strain.

genome signature comparisons between plasmids and genomes of a representative host
finally, we compared the genomic dissimilarity between  <dig> plasmids from the plasmid genome database and a single applicable representative chromosome each. in the case that multiple representative host chromosome sequences are available, a conservative choice was made . for this analysis we excluded the different b. aphidicola and p. syringae plasmids, as no representative genome sequence can be selected due to high δ* values between chromosome sequences of members of the same species. similar to the previous analysis, the genome signature of the majority of the plasmids exceeds that of the preponderance of the genomic fragments of each representative host chromosome, and has a lower gc content than the bulk of the chromosomal fragments of each representative host . also, we observe an increase in the number of plasmids with a very high gc content.

correlation between nucleotide composition discordance with host genomes and plasmid's size and mobility
of  <dig> plasmids,  <dig> have a δ* value higher than the δ* value of 80% of identical  sized fragments of their host genome , again indicating discordance in composition between plasmids and their host's genome. of  <dig> plasmids, only  <dig>  have a δ* value lower than that of 80%  of the identical sized fragments of their host's genome. there was no relation with species of the host. of these  <dig> plasmids,  <dig> have a size between  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp,  <dig> had a size between  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp, while only one was larger than  <dig> kbp. of these  <dig> plasmids, eight  harboured genes encoding putative proteins involved in mobility, another three  had genes encoding putative proteins involved in transposition and five  contained information encoding putative proteins involved in integration  <cit> . in contrast, of  <dig> plasmids,  <dig> have a δ* value higher than all identical sized fragments of their host's genome, indicating a high discordance between the nucleotide composition of these plasmids and that of their host genomes. the size of only three of these  <dig> plasmids ranged between  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp and that of only four between  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp. the remaining  <dig> plasmids with a high compositional discordance with their host's genome were larger than  <dig> kbp. again, relation with species of the host was not observed. however, of these  <dig> plasmids,  <dig>  harboured genes encoding putative proteins involved in mobility or transfer, while another eight  encoded genes encoding putative proteins involved in transposition and only five  contained information encoding putative proteins involved in integration.

discussion
in general, we find high genomic dissimilarity scores between plasmid sequences and representative host chromosome sequences. in addition, the gc contents of the plasmids show a bias towards low  gc percentage scores. this lower gc content in plasmids has previously been noted, and has been explained in terms of a higher energy cost and limited availability of g and c over a and t/u  <cit> . although available genome sequences are biased as they originate predominantly from medically and industrially relevant strains, it is unlikely that these plasmids form a particular class. in addition, our results are in accordance with those obtained by wong and co-workers  <cit> . they showed, for a limited number of plasmids, that chromosomes within a species share a more similar dinucleotide composition, or genome signature, than plasmids do with the host chromosome.

previously, campell and co-workers compared plasmids to a collection of large chromosomal fragments of the host and showed that the genome signatures between each plasmid and its natural host rank amongst the closest  <cit> . their suggestion that similar genome signatures of plasmids and host chromosome is required for plasmid establishment is not supported by the present data  <cit> . we find that intragenomic compositional comparisons of plasmids with their host often show higher genomic dissimilarity values than the genomic dissimilarity between genomic fragments and their host chromosome. this difference in interpretation of plasmid δ* values may be results of the, to our opinion more robust, method to compare these values with that of their host chromosome. first a distribution of δ* values by comparing disjoint genomic fragments to the full genomic sequence is made, providing information about the average and variance of the δ* values that a single species can display in different regions of its genome. fragments with extreme δ* values  may result from events such as horizontal transfer or are caused by other genomic aberrations   <cit> . thus, these extreme fragments deviate substantially from the average genome composition and are considered compositionally dissimilar from the average chromosome content. consequently, although the δ* values of most plasmids may fall within the very close category defined by campbell and co-workers, we consider them as dissimilar, since they behave like the extreme fragments in the distribution plot. in addition, by comparing each plasmid with its host genome fragmented into pieces with the same size of the plasmid, the effect of the sensitivity of δ* of small dna fragments to small changes in word is circumvented.

the genome signature of dna is thought to have evolved due to selection exerted by its host's replication, recombination and repair machineries, resulting in comparable genome signatures between members of the same species, but different genome signatures between members of different species  <cit> . plasmids seem to be less subjected to these selective pressures, although they are allegedly confined to a limited number of hosts due to the presence of partitioning genes and their dependence on the host replication machinery.

the observed genomic dissimilarity between the three different b. aphidicola genome sequences supports a role for replication, recombination and repair proteins in determining the genome signature. as the genome signature represents evolutionary relatedness between species similarly as other more classical parameters, such as 16s rna similarity  <cit> , intraspecific high genomic dissimilarity scores indicates rapid genome evolution or long-term host co-speciation . the loss of genes involved in replication, recombination and the repair machinery in buchnera genomes  <cit>  might be responsible for the divergence of their genome signatures. these intracellular endosymbionts might then form an excellent example to investigate the origin of the genome signature. interestingly, we find a buchnera plasmid  which shows a high genomic dissimilarity with the genome sequence from the same strain from which the plasmid was isolated ), and a lower genomic dissimilarity with both other buchnera genome sequences. this supports a history of mobility for this plasmid, in which it was recently acquired from a different buchnera strain, similar to previous observations by van ham and co-workers  <cit> . interestingly, high genomic dissimilarity between members of the same genus  has been observed previously  <cit> , which also concerns bacteria with an intracellular life-style.

we suggest three possible explanations for the reduced sensitivity of plasmids to the selective pressures generating their host's genome signature. first, the observed high genome signature dissimilarity may actually prevent the integration of plasmids into the host chromosome. thus, what is observed for non-integrating plasmids in nature may be a biased pool of compositionally dissimilar dna, as similar plasmids could potentially integrate into their host's chromosome more readily. secondly, horizontally mobile plasmids may occasionally be exposed to the extracellular environment, where the atypical dinucleotide composition may favour resistance to degradation of the plasmid. such a mechanism might drive the genome signature of plasmids towards comparable values, but the large variety in gc content among plasmids suggests otherwise. however, we cannot exclude that different environments select for different genome signatures. thirdly, horizontal transmission of plasmids may be far more important than currently thought. this latter point is supported by the conclusion in a recent review by sorensen and co-workers, that the overall extent of the hgt of plasmids in the environment examined might have been underestimated  <cit> . in addition, plasmid transfer between genera, phyla and even different domains has been described  <cit> . plasmid transfer between unrelated species may be rare, but followed by a more rapid distribution among related species, would result in compositional discordance between many plasmids and their host. our data, showing that a large proportion of the plasmids with high nucleotide discordance with their host's genome harbour genes encoding proteins involved in mobility or plasmid transfer, fits with this notion.

in addition, the plasmids showing relatively low nucleotide discordance with their host's genome are smaller than those showing high nucleotide discordance with their host's genome . this could be indicative for a larger sensitivity of δ* of small dna fragments to small changes in word than larger plasmids. however, 50% of the plasmids with a relatively low compositional discordance with their host's genome are larger than  <dig> kbp. moreover, as aforementioned, the δ* value of each plasmid is compared with a distribution of δ* values of disjoint genomic fragments compared to the full genomic sequence, which provides information about the average and variance of the δ* values that in different regions of the host's genome. on the other hand, the copy number of small plasmids is in general higher than that of large plasmids. this would implicate faster replication of these smaller plasmids, hence faster amelioration rates.

we suggest that plasmids with high genomic dissimilarity scores are relatively recently acquired by the host, while the minority of plasmids with a genome signature similar to that of the host genome share a longer history with that host . the latter, strictly vertically transmitted, plasmids may therefore show a less atypical dinucleotide composition as a result from co-evolution with the host, but also selection due to extracellular conditions would be absent.

CONCLUSIONS
the high genome signature divergence between plasmids and their hosts indicates that plasmids are excluded from the selective pressures that generate the genome signature, hence form a separate dna flux within the global microbial metagenome. this suggests a more indiscriminate lifestyle for plasmids than previously anticipated.
