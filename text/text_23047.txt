BACKGROUND
in vertebrates, the cysteine- and glycine-rich proteins  encoded by the csrp genes are evolutionarily conserved proteins that define a subset of zinc-binding lim domain proteins. as structural hallmarks, these proteins exhibit two lim domains with a characteristic spacing, adjacent glycine-rich repeats, and a potential nuclear localization signal  <cit> . originally, this family of lim domain proteins included three members  that were independently isolated in the course of different experimental strategies  <cit> . subsequently, based on structural and sequence similarities, the thymus lim protein  was grouped into this subclass of lim domain proteins  <cit> . the four crps possess significant differences in their temporal and spatial patterns of expression raising interesting questions regarding the physiological and biological significance of the crp multigene family  <cit> . for example, it is uncertain if these proteins perform unique functions or substitute for each other within a living organism. the cell types and organs that express the different crps suggest several hypothetical functions for this group of lim domain proteins, including possible roles in organization and stabilization of the contractile myofibrillar/cytoskeletal apparatus  <cit> , maintenance of cellular functions  <cit> , differentiation  <cit> , transcriptional regulation  <cit> , and in the establishment of fibrogenic responses  <cit> . in addition to this potential functional versatility, there is growing evidence supporting the notion that the two lim domains of crps serve as protein interfaces mediating specific protein-protein interactions thereby arranging two or more protein constituents into nuclear transcription or cytoskeletal complexes  <cit> . in this regard, the crp <dig> protein  is best characterized. it is a positive regulator of myogenic differentiation that was first identified in a screen for genes that become transcriptionally upregulated as a result of skeletal muscle denervation  <cit> . in accordance, the overexpression of mlp in c <dig> myoblasts potentiates myogenic differentiation  <cit>  and the absence of the csrp3/mlp gene product causes a phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy underscoring the hypothesis that crp3/mlp is an essential regulator of cardiac muscle development  <cit> . in line with this hypothesis, the morphological and clinical picture of dilated cardiomyopathy in humans is associated with altered csrp3/mlp expression  <cit>  and csrp3/mlp mutations were found in families suffering from dilated as well as from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  <cit> .

together, crp <dig> and crp <dig> were shown to be potent smooth muscle differentiation cofactors triggering the conversion of pluripotent 10t1/ <dig> fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells when overexpressed together with serum response factor  and gata proteins  <cit> . compatible with this presumed function is the finding that crp <dig> is present at highest levels in arterial samples  <cit> . moreover, a recent report demonstrated that crp <dig> can effectively switch on smooth muscle gene activity in adult cardiac myocytes  <cit>  suggesting that crp <dig> has essential functions in controlling smooth muscle gene activity.

furthermore, during embryogenesis and in adult tissue, csrp <dig> gene expression is also prominently associated with mesenchyme and epithelia  <cit> . interestingly, compared to other crp family members, crp <dig> expression begins early in gestation and has a distinct pattern of tissue distribution during cardiovascular development.  <cit> . crp <dig> is expressed transiently in early embryonic cardiomyocytes similar to smooth muscle cell markers like α-smooth muscle actin, calponin, and sm22α  <cit>  but its expression is downregulated in adult cardiomyocytes. additionally, it was demonstrated that the expression of crp <dig> is downregulated with cellular dedifferentiation induced by oncogenic transformation, injury, or wound healing  <cit> .

recently, it was demonstrated that the loss of crp <dig> did not result in any apparent gross vascular defects or altered expression of smooth muscle cell markers  <cit> . moreover, vascular development, morphology, cell proliferation, endothelial regeneration and the expression of several characteristic smooth muscle specific genes were similar between wt and csrp <dig> nulls. however, the loss of crp <dig> is correlated with increased neointima formation in response to vascular injury. furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from mice lacking crp <dig> migrated more rapidly in response to pdgf-bb with an increased activation of the rho gtpase rac <dig> suggesting that csrp <dig> and its protein product crp <dig> are functionally linked to cell migration  <cit> .

we here report about the generation and characterization of a similar csrp <dig> null mouse model. we demonstrate that these deficient mice are viable and fertile, exhibiting a mild cardiac phenotype in which the cardiomyocytes display a slight increase in their thickness, indicating moderate hypertrophy at the cellular level. in line with these findings, the peculiarity of heart architecture reflected by the typical arrangement of intercalated disc-associated proteins  was altered suggesting that crp <dig> is involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton in cardiac muscle cells.

RESULTS
chromosomal localization of the murine csrp <dig> gene
by use of the t <dig> mouse/hamster radiation hybrid  panel  <cit>  containing a set of  <dig> different dnas from somatic cell hybrids, we localized the murine csrp <dig> gene to chromosome  <dig>  in this analysis with the highest anchor lod of  <dig>  was assigned to d10mit <dig> with a best-fit location between markers d10mit <dig> proximal and d10mit <dig> central, confirming the gene position that was recently launched by the mouse genome sequencing consortium . noteworthy, this region is syntenic to human chromosomal region 12q <dig>  , essentially the region to which the human orthologue was previously assigned  <cit> .

targeted disruption of the csrp <dig> gene
for generation of the targeting vector we isolated and sequenced a ~ <dig>  kbp genomic clone of the murine csrp <dig> gene . the targeting construct was generated by insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into the stui restriction site of exon  <dig> and contained  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream sequences . after transfection of es cells with the targeting construct, we tested  <dig> transformants by southern blot using an external hybridization probe. sixteen of these es clones were found to have incorporated the targeted vector by homologous recombination. subsequently, es clones carrying the disrupted csrp <dig> gene were injected into c57bl/6j blastocysts, and transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant recipients. the mouse chimeras were identified by the inspection of the proportion of coat agouti skin color ranging from complete white to near 80% black. crosses between chimeras and c57bl/6j mice revealed that the es cell genome was transmitted through the germline, as indicated by the agouti skin color of the offspring. f <dig> hybrids tested to be heterozygous for the disrupted gene were backcrossed  into the c57bl/6j strain background. to generate csrp <dig> null mice, we interbred heterozygous animals and genotyped litters after weaning at  <dig> weeks of age using a genotyping pcr strategy . furthermore, we performed southern blot hybridization using an external probe to demonstrate that the targeting construct was correctly inserted into the csrp <dig> locus . to demonstrate the absence of specific csrp <dig> transcripts, we performed northern blot analysis  and quantitative pcr  revealing that the level of csrp <dig> mrna was half that of the wild type in heterozygous csrp2+/- null mouse. however, an aberrant rna species that appeared at very low level was expressed in gene-disrupted mice . sequence analysis of a cdna generated by reverse transcription of the respective mrna species revealed that this aberrant message was generated by artificial splicing of exon  <dig> to the downstream neomycin/exon <dig> boundary . this rna does not produce any protein product at any size as tested by western blot analysis .

crp <dig> deficient mice are viable and fertile
mice homologous for the targeted deletion had no gross phenotypic abnormalities, and development and reproductive function appeared normal. dna analysis of  <dig> progeny  derived from csrp2+/- intercrosses revealed that csrp2-/- mice were born in the predicted 1:2: <dig> mendelian distribution . mating of homozygous males with homozygous females produced viable offspring of normal litter size at normal frequency indicating that crp2-deficient mice were fertile and pregnancies were carried out to full term. to detect possible structural defects induced by the absence of csrp <dig>  we comparatively examined formalin-fixed tissue sections of adult wt and csrp2-/- mice. we found that sections taken from kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, lung, brain, thymus, stomach, or intestine were indistinguishable from those of control mice .

detailed analysis of heart architecture
previous reports have demonstrated that the absence of another crp family member  reproduces the morphological and clinical picture of dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans  <cit> . furthermore, independent studies have shown that csrp <dig> expression is detectable in both vascular and venous smooth muscle cells and in cardiomyocytes throughout embryogenesis suggesting an important role for csrp <dig> in the developing heart and cardiovascular system  <cit> . therefore, we decided to direct our attention to potential alterations of the heart. compared to csrp3/mlp-/-, the csrp <dig> nulls had no apparent degeneration or enlargements, and the weight and size of hearts taken from csrp2-/- mice were indistinguishable from control littermates. however, a more detailed morphometric analysis of myocardial sections revealed that the thickness/diameter of  cardiomyocytes was significantly higher in the csrp2-disrupted mice  .

based on the knowledge that the z discs of csrp3/mlp-/- mice show misalignment and the fact that crp <dig> has affinity for α-actinin  <cit> , we next envisaged to comparatively analyse the z-disc defining the lateral boundaries of the sarcomere. to do so, we first tested if crp <dig> is expressed in adult cultured cardiomyocytes . this analysis revealed that, compared to the regular arrangement of α-actinin and f-actin, crp <dig> showed a more irregular staining pattern in cultured cardiomyocytes. in the in vivo situation, crp <dig> was most prominently localized at the intercalated disc . however, in contrast to mlp-/- cardiomyocytes in which the myofibrils are somewhat disorganized, the localization pattern of α-actinin, an integral component of the z-disc is indistinguishable in wild-type and csrp2-/- cardiomyocytes . furthermore, the intercalated discs were more convoluted in csrp2-/- mouse hearts than in hearts of wild type littermates  but less pronounced than in the csrp3/mlp null mice . we next addressed the question whether a lack of crp <dig> expression would lead to a change of the molecular composition of the intercalated disc in addition to its altered ultrastructure, as previously described for the csrp3/mlp knock out mice  <cit> . although less pronounced than in the csrp3/mlp knock out mice, we found that csrp <dig> knock outs show also increased signal for the adherens junction protein β-catenin at the intercalated disc, while there is less signal for connexin- <dig>  the component of the gap junctions . likewise, the slight increase of cardiomyocyte thickness in csrp2-/- mice were detectable confirming the diameter measurements described above. to test if the increased signals determined for n-rap and β-catenin are due to a higher expression of these proteins or an altered distribution, we performed western blot analysis . we found that the expression of both proteins was unmodified compared to normal control mice, while we confirmed the increase in expression of both proteins in csrp3-/-/mlp-/- deficient mice.

expression of csrp <dig> and csrp <dig> in crp <dig> deficient mice
to investigate whether expression of csrp <dig> and csrp <dig> was affected by the absence of crp <dig>  we isolated rnas from different organs and compared the transcript levels of respective genes in wild-type and homozygous mutant mice. total rna was isolated from different tissues and the relative amounts of csrp <dig> and csrp3/mlp mrnas were determined by northern blot analysis. we found that the transcriptional activity of csrp <dig> and csrp <dig> genes in csrp2-/- mice was indistinguishable from controls .

discussion
crp <dig> belongs to the crp family of lim domain proteins that are evolutionarily conserved. the sequence of mouse crp <dig> displays  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % amino acid identity to human, quail, and chicken crp <dig>  respectively. therefore, it is supposed that this lim domain protein has a critically, evolutionarily conserved role for the development or maintenance of vital processes within organisms. consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that csrp <dig> expression is detectable in a number of cell types during embryogenesis, including mesenchyme, vascular smooth muscle cells, and epithelial derivatives  <cit> . it was also demonstrated that csrp <dig> is expressed in the cardiovascular system at early time points during mouse development indicating an important role in vascular smooth muscle differentiation  <cit> . based on the knowledge that crp <dig> and other crps can bind to zyxin, α-actinin, and α-actin  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that these proteins are bridging molecules that are important for the organization or stabilization of cytoskeletal structures. this is also supported by structural data showing that the two tandemly arranged lim domains are completely independent folded units that are linked by a highly flexible spacer  <cit> .

moreover, csrp <dig> was originally identified from normal quail embryo fibroblasts that were screened for genes suppressed in the course of oncogenic transformation  <cit> . subsequently, it was demonstrated that the transcriptional suppression of csrp <dig> is generally linked to the transformed state of cells  <cit>  suggesting that crp <dig> might have tumor-suppressor activity. in this context it is remarkable that the reintroduction of crp <dig> into human breast and colorectal cancer cell lines was sufficient to significantly decrease colony formation  <cit> . however, all these findings demonstrate that indeed crp <dig> must have specific functions both in development and control of cancer cell growth. considering the postulated roles and the observed expression pattern of crp <dig>  the finding that mice lacking a functional csrp <dig> gene exhibit a quite mild phenotype was unexpected but is in agreement with a recent report characterizing a similar csrp <dig> gene disruption in mice  <cit> . no gross morphological or physiological abnormalities were detected, suggesting that csrp <dig> is dispensable for normal development. this finding is somewhat surprising, since the ablation of the crp3/mlp or tlp genes is associated with striking morphological and functional alterations  <cit> . possibly, there exists a functional redundancy that is known from other myogenic factors  <cit> . this would give rise to "cryptic robustness" to cells and organs expressing different crps. conversely, a loss of function mutation or an experimental inactivation of a csrp gene would predominantly affect cells or organs exclusively expressing this family member. there are some good arguments supporting this "quantitative model of crp function". first, different independent studies have shown that crp3/mlp is exclusively expressed in heart at high level and to a lower extent in skeletal muscle  <cit> . the abundance of csrp3/mlp transcripts in these organs is several times higher than those of csrp <dig> and csrp <dig> . therefore, it is reasonable that the crp quantities expressed by these genes cannot compensate for crp3/mlp. consistent with our hypothesis, it is not surprising that csrp3/mlp nulls have a strong cardiac phenotype  <cit>  and csrp3/mlp mutations are associated with heart failure in humans  <cit> . secondly, tlp is highly expressed in the thymus and accordingly mice deficient for tlp have alterations of normal thymus function  <cit> . third, our data presented in this study indicate that the loss of crp <dig> has only a mild cardiac phenotype. compared to the csrp3/mlp knock out model  <cit> , the cardiac alterations are much less pronounced. the localisation of crp <dig>  and the alterations in tissue distribution of n-rap and β-catenin found in animals lacking crp <dig>  point to a functionality of crp <dig> in the organisation of the intercalated disc. in this regard, crp <dig> might cooperate with other crps. it is tempting to speculate that during heart development csrp3/mlp or csrp <dig> may be in the position to compensate for the loss of crp <dig>  this principle may also be true for the development of other organs. csrp <dig> is broadly expressed in mouse embryos and adults  <cit> . likewise, csrp <dig> is widely expressed in mouse tissues  <cit>  and expression coincides with that of csrp <dig> . noteworthy, the csrp <dig> and csrp <dig> genes are expressed in early vertebrate embryos and are spatially regulated in mouse  <cit> . in this regard, the recent finding that both, crp <dig> and crp <dig>  are able to convert pluripotent 10t1/ <dig> fibroblasts into smooth muscle cells  <cit>  demonstrates that these crps share some functions. together, these observations are in agreement with the notion that individual crps share redundant functions and may explain the mild phenotype of the csrp2-/- mouse and the surprising observation that csrp <dig> thought to be involved in key biological processes could be removed without affecting the organism.

a recent report has shown that crp <dig> physically associates with other cardiovascular lineage regulators, such as serum response factor  and gata proteins, thereby synergistically activating the transcription of smooth muscle cell target genes  with contractile abilities  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the lack of crp <dig> cause alterations in expression of respective genes resulting in cardiomyocytes displaying a slight increase in thickness. crp <dig> and its close homologue crp <dig> are co-expressed during early cardiovascular development and both crps share similar functionality in facilitating transcriptional activity of the srf-gata-complex, especially of promoters encoding the smc target genes  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable that crp <dig> in the csrp <dig> nulls can substitute for crp <dig> resulting in the observed mild phenotype. noteworthy, this functional substitution is not overall complete. in preliminary echocardiography using five animals each we found indications that the disruption of the csrp <dig> gene is associated with a lower left ventricular wall thickness and fractional shortening  indicating reduced heart function in respective nulls.

however, the lack of an "obvious csrp2-/- phenotype" in an animal kept under laboratory conditions constitutes no compelling argument against a unique and indispensable role of a gene in the normal physiology and the specialized in vivo function of crp <dig> may become apparent only after appropriate challenges to the mice. in this context, it might be significant that apart from the shared binding affinity of crp <dig>  crp <dig> and crp3/mlp to zyxin and α-actinin, we and others have isolated proteins specifically interacting with individual crps  <cit> . the ability of crps to discriminate between different target proteins may the basis for subtle differences in functionality. such an overlap of functional redundancy with protein specific activities was also demonstrated in the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix  genes  <cit> . comparable to the csrp2-/- nulls, the inactivation of myod leads to up-regulation of the myogenic hlh gene myf- <dig> and results in normal development  <cit> . it is possible that during early development and differentiation of different myogenic lineages, myogenic factors and also crps act cooperatively, but exert distinct function at later stages, when the fine-tuning of cellular programs happens.

the demonstration that the csrp <dig> gene is silenced during cellular transformation and crp <dig> protein induces growth-inhibitory effects when overexpressed in cancer cells points to a critical role in the control of normal cell growth. future studies will clarify whether mice or cells lacking crp <dig> will be more susceptible to tumor promoters or other physiological stress factors. moreover, the phenotype of mice lacking several members of the crp family will be highly informative as it directly addresses the question of mutual functional substitution and redundancy.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the lim domain protein crp <dig> is involved in normal cardiomyocyte development. the loss of crp <dig> influences the fine architecture of the intercalated disc morphology.
