BACKGROUND
the massive sequencing of eukaryote genomes has lead to an unprecedented discovery of fundamental features of an abundant class of non-coding regulatory elements, the micrornas . recognized as the micromanagers of gene expression, mirnas added a new layer of complexity to the regulation of protein-coding genes, owing to its ability of virtually silence any mrna in the cell  <cit> .

the occurrence of deeply conserved and species-specific mirnas in metazoan, argues in favor of a permanent, rapid and uneven evolutionary process of mirna genes emergence  <cit> . notably, episodes of mirna repertoire acquirement positively correlate to increased animal complexity  <cit> . actually, several studies revealed that the origin and evolution of mirna loci resemble that of protein-coding genes, being prompted by classical evolutionary forces, such as duplication, mutation and genetic drift. such dynamism generated paralogous members producing identical or nearly identical mature sequences  <cit>  many of which are clusterized and expressed in a cell-specific or tissue-enriched basis  <cit> .

in this sense, a suite of mirnas, including mir- <dig>  −133a, −133b, − <dig>  −208a, −208b, − <dig> and − <dig>  were identified as highly enriched or specifically expressed in cardiac and/or skeletal muscle cells of animals . these muscle-enriched mirnas are known to play essential roles in muscle biology by controlling processes like myogenesis , regeneration, aging, homeostasis, apoptosis and immune responses  <cit> .

in animals, mirna expression profiles and functions in muscle and other tissues depend on the mirna genomic context, which ultimately correspond to mirna location, conservation and organization in the genome  <cit> . peculiarities such as the physical distance between mirna genes in chromosomes  <cit>  or mirna location in comparison to protein coding genes  may provide important clues regarding coordinated regulation and function of mirnas. however, current knowledge on the genomic context of muscle mirnas has been unveiled in a reduced number of vertebrates, thus preventing more informative large scale comparisons. indeed, available data mostly reflects features from mammal mirnas, whereas fish, the largest class of living vertebrates, remain largely uncharted.

thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate particular features in the genomic organization and the putative evolutionary history of muscle-enriched mirnas in fish through genome-wide comparative analysis.

precursor mirna  sequences retrieved from zebrafish genome at mirbase  were used as reference for successive blast searches against our compiled fish database. recovered matches corresponding to pre-mirnas of all nine fish species were manually annotated and aligned in order to verify interspecies arrangement and composition. moreover, several other vertebrate pre-mirna sequences from amphibians , reptiles , birds  and mammals  were retrieved from mirbase and ensembl, aligned with muscle algorithm  <cit>  using default parameters and compared to orthologs from fish species.

genomic context comparative analysis
comparisons on the physical distance between mirnas in a same cluster or their exact localization were performed in order to evaluate the changeability in the arrangement of muscle mirnas in the genome of fishes. additionally, to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of mir- <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig>  we performed an analysis of synteny of fish chromosomal segments harboring these mirna genes. the synteny analysis was conducted in the browser genomicus  using reference genes annotated in the nile tilapia genome. since genomicus only accept a protein-coding gene name as input data, we designed two workflows based on the genomic organization  of each muscle mirna evaluated. for intronic mirnas the host gene  was used as reference. for intergenic mirnas the closer downstream protein encoding genes  were used as reference. only nine protein-coding genes located up and downstream were considered for generating the synteny analysis data. all results generated on genomicus were manually checked by blast searches against fish genomes evaluated. for the elephant shark whose genome was not available at ensembl database, cds sequences of the mirna neighbor genes were retrieved from the nile tilapia genome and blast searched against the elephant shark genome to determine the location of these genes.

secondary structure prediction
the secondary structure of all muscle mirnas were retrieved from the consensus sequence acquired from the alignment of precursor sequences formerly constructed. these analyses were carried out on rnafold algorithm  <cit>  using default parameters.

furthermore, we performed an analysis of secondary structure of precursor sequences of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> paralog copy obtained from each fish species in order to verify the paralog compliance to the hairpin structure required by the mirna biogenesis model.

phylogenetic tree
phylogenetic relationships were constructed based on the 80 bp alignment of precursor sequences of mir- <dig> from diverse vertebrate species  as well as mir- <dig> paralog sequences from fish species, recovered by blast, as previously mentioned. then a maximum likelihood tree was generated on mega  <dig>  <cit>  by using tamura-nei model with bootstrap of  <dig> replications. only nodes occurring in over 50% of trees were assumed to be significant. the final tree was adjusted on figtree v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

target prediction
predictions searching for mrna targets shared by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were carried out using the online tool targetscan . comparisons of shared targets were checked by name in the gene ontology database  <cit> .

RESULTS
precursor and mature mirna features
overall, muscle mirnas genes were highly conserved among species of vertebrates investigated. interspecific comparisons of fish pre-mirnas sequences to counterparts from other seven representatives of all living groups of vertebrates  revealed a similarity of roughly 85% for each muscle pre-mirna . indeed, the comparison of predicted secondary structures of orthologous confirmed that all of them shape into a hairpin structure compliant to the mirna biogenesis model  <cit> . in the comparison of mature sequences, the degree of similarity among orthologous was even higher, ranging from ~95% to perfectly matched sequences . such findings suggest that muscle mirnas examined have been under strong selective constraint throughout the evolution of vertebrates, thereby reflecting an acquirement of primordial functions on muscle biology. in fact once a mirna evolves and acquires a function in a strictly tissue-specific context, it is rarely lost  <cit> . based on the comparison of here acquired to available data , it is possible to infer that all muscle mirnas investigated are ancient and derived from an early gnathostome ancestor.table  <dig>

burst and expansion of the mirna repertoire took place at the base of the bilaterian lineage  <cit>  and later at the base of vertebrate lineage  <cit> . however it is essential to have in mind that the evolution of mirnas is an ongoing process and novel mirnas are emerging  <cit> . the homologs of ancient mirnas that emerged more recently by duplication and are still not under functional constraint, may either evolve fast, potentially originating other mirnas, or be conserved, as verified for the mir- <dig> paralog identified in the present study .

typically, more ancient mirnas undergo fewer changes than mirnas that have emerged more recently, implying that the sequences of young mirnas have higher evolutionary rates than old mirnas. this can be attested through an examination of all segments of the hairpin, comprising the mature sequences  and seed regions. for instance mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  whose origin remounts to a common ancestor of protostomia and deuterostomia  <cit> , were amongst the most conserved mirnas . by contrast, mirna clusters such as mir-310 ~  <dig> from fruit flies and beetles  <cit> , and mir-290 ~  <dig> from mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> , were found to be young fast-evolving mirna families. another fast-evolving mirna family was recently found in primate, but not in rodent. this emergent primate-specific mirnas became integrated into ancient gene circuitry improving post-transcriptional control  <cit> .

thereby we envision that events of mirnas acquisition and loss might have occurred in basal organisms in response to changes in morphological and physiological traits alongside evolution of vertebrates, as for instance challenges emerged during transition from aquatic to terrestrial ambient. therefore, the origins of muscle-enriched mirnas can be related to an acquisition of new physiological and ontogenetic patterns by the gene expression regulatory machinery, which reflects in their constrained evolution  <cit> .

looking at mirnas location we found that mir-1-1/133a- <dig>  mir-1-2/133a- <dig> and mir-206/133b form bicistronic clusters in fish, exactly as in the genome of mammals  <cit> . we have found a relative conservation of mir-1-2/-133a- <dig> within its respective intron, once their locations were unchanged for the majority of species. exceptions were found for spotted gar and elephant shark that presented the mir-1-2/-133a- <dig> at the same intronic position detected in horse . precursor sequences of clustered mirnas above mentioned also kept a constant between-genes spacing . on the other hand, the intergenic mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> genes varied in location, being more sparsely distributed in the genomes of zebrafish, medaka, nile tilapia and coelacanth  than did their homologs in birds and mammals  or in stickleback, spotted gar and elephant shark which followed the same arrangement of reptiles and amphibians .

we found mir- <dig> inside heavy-chain myosin gene myh7b gene  as previously described for mammals  <cit>  even for the extra copies detected in zebrafish. our analysis revealed that mir- <dig> does not have an intronic position conserved in vertebrate species. however, data analysis referred to the expression pattern of this mirna indicates that the co-transcription within their host gene was conserved as well as the uncoupled transcription from its host gene detected in mouse  <cit> .

furthermore, mir- <dig> is clusterized  and intronic of dnm <dig> gene as reported in mammals  <cit> . however neither the widely distributed nor the paralog copy have shown a conserved intronic localization among vertebrates, indicating singularities of mir- <dig> organization in the genomes analyzed.

muscle mirnas synteny
the analysis of muscle-enriched mirnas gene-neighborhood revealed most genes in high synteny and colinearity within ray-finned fish genomes, with exception made to genes surrounding mir-1-1/-133a- <dig>  the vicinity of this cluster presented none synteny within nile tilapia genome and low synteny among other fish species analyzed, as just medaka, stickleback and spotted gar had an equivalent structural distribution for a few coding genes , by using zebrafish as reference . in fact, by extending this comparative analysis to encompass other vertebrate species, synteny was lowered to a single gene  as previously demonstrated  <cit> . interestingly, elephant shark genome has a duplicated mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> cluster but only one of the copies maintains the gata <dig> gene syntenic to other vertebrate species. furthermore, we detected that cables <dig> gene is located on the same chromosome of mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> in zebrafish, medaka and stickleback genome but with a larger distance than previously reported  <cit> , having more than nine genes between cables <dig> gene and the mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> cluster . we further discovered that the cluster mir-1-1/133a- <dig> is absent in tetraodon and fugu genomes. in other words, the bicistronic cluster mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> has an unpredictable arrangement on chromosomes of fish species, thus indicating to be under relaxed evolutionary constraint.figure  <dig>

conversely, conserved blocks of coding genes surrounded the gene-neighborhood of the paralog mir-1-2/-133a- <dig> cluster  in ray-finned fish genomes . our analysis revealed a larger syntenic region among fish species than formerly  <cit> . our data showed that gata <dig> and cables <dig> genes are highly conserved in fish genomes, but when comparing teleost fishes we found a gene block conserved within these genomes composed by genes abhd <dig>  rock <dig>  usp <dig> and thoc <dig>  in zebrafish, however, mir-1-2/-133a- <dig> cluster presents a few conserved protein-coding flanking genes , perhaps because it is situated on the scaffold_ <dig> that has a limited length of  <dig>  bp and has not yet been anchored into zebrafish chromosomes.

the mir-206/-133b cluster presented higher synteny at downstream than at upstream genes . for instance, medaka, spotted gar and coelacanth upstream region is not syntenic to stickleback, fugu, tetraodon and nile tilapia, which, in turn, have many common genes in colinearity. for this cluster higher syntenic levels among fish genomes were found for genes eif2b <dig>  atraid and snx <dig>  zebrafish was the unique species carrying two mir-206/-133b clusters, each at chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  possibly the cluster at chromosome  <dig> stand for the young extra copy, since its gene-neighborhood has shown very low synteny levels , which indicates a duplication event conjugated within these blocks.

synteny was also common to coding genes nearby mir- <dig> orthologs, even in the neighboring of the non-intronic mir- <dig> of medaka and stickleback genomes . in this study we recovered  <dig> syntenic coding genes among teleostei fishes, whereas holostei  and dipnomorpha  showed six genes in sinteny, and none of these genes were synteny to their orthologs in other vertebrate groups. in fact, a unique exception is the trpc4ap gene that was earlier related as conserved near mir- <dig> and myh7b host gene from fish to mammals  <cit> . moreover, the two extra copies of mir- <dig> and myh7b located at chr_ <dig> on zebrafish genome displayed a non-syntenic arrangement, since we barely detected a single gene  with correspondence at the syntenic block of the mir- <dig> orthologs shared by the majority of vertebrates.

in general, mir- <dig> orthologs have been organized as syntenic blocks in fishes although particular features were also uncovered. for instance, the tetraodon genome experienced a rearrangement in the mir- <dig> neighbor genes pigc, tmed <dig>  suco, mysm <dig> and oma <dig> moved from downstream to an upstream segment, likely by a translocation episode . interestingly, the stickleback genome does not share any genes on its downstream region with other fishes. it is probably caused by the proximity of mir- <dig> and its host gene to the 3’end of the scaffold sequence they are located. in the case of mir-214-par, it was embedded within a conserved syntenic block on all studied species .

absence of mir- <dig> in cartilaginous and ray-finned fish genomes
unexpectedly, the genome mapping of muscle mirnas revealed that cartilaginous and ray-finned fish genomes do not retain the mir- <dig> gene , whereas it exists as single-copy in lobe-finned fishes. thus, to better trace mir- <dig> evolution, a more exhaustive search on further three fish  and  <dig> other vertebrate genomes  was performed. this survey reinforced that mir- <dig> gene is absent in cartilaginous and ray-finned fishes and demonstrated that it exists as single-copy not only in lobe-finned fishes, but also in all amphibians, reptiles and birds so far fully sequenced. additionally, a second paralog copy was detected to all mammals investigated.

examining the two mir- <dig> copies recovered in mammals, the paralogs mir-208a and mir-208b, we detected that both were intronic of myh <dig> and myh <dig>  respectively, in agreement to a previous report in mouse and human  <cit> . we then looked at mir- <dig> host genes myh <dig> and myh <dig> and noticed that myh <dig> was actually absent into all fish genomes, whereas myh <dig> persists but missing the intronic mir- <dig>  except for coelacanth that retain the mir- <dig> intronic to myh <dig>  once two copies of mir- <dig> intronic of myh <dig>  were reported in the basal agnatha petromyzon marinus, our findings strongly suggest that mir- <dig> have been secondarily lost in the cartilaginous and ray-finned fish lineage.

in mammals, mir- <dig> is required for the expression of mir- <dig>  which is intronic of the myh7b gene  <cit> . in the zebrafish genome, which lost mir- <dig>  three extant copies of mir- <dig> intronic to myh7b have been previously described  <cit> . so, we further examined the mir- <dig> paralogs and find out that two of them are closely located  in the chromosome  <dig>  curiously, a similar arrangement was detected in mammals for the two intronic mir- <dig> paralogs and their myosin host genes . otherwise, the majority of vertebrate species presented a single intronic copy of mir- <dig> within myh7b, physically unlinked to mir- <dig> paralogs and their myh <dig> and myh <dig> host genes. moreover, we found that tetraodon, fugu and nile tilapia genomes carry a second non-sintenic copy of myh7b that does not harbor the intronic mir- <dig>  whereas medaka and stickleback have a single non-intronic mir- <dig> gene.figure  <dig>

together our data regarding mir- <dig> genomic organization in fish genomes corroborates recent findings from bhuiyan et al.  <cit> , which have found medaka mir- <dig> expression patterns are comparable to those reported in zebrafish  <cit>  despite the uncoupling condition of these genes in medaka genome. however, data about the expression pattern of myh7b in fish genomes carrying non-intronic mir- <dig> has not been formerly reported. the mir- <dig> is considered essential for the differentiation and maintenance of slow-twitch muscle fiber type  <cit>  as well as for heart development and health  <cit> . our data suggests that the lack of mir- <dig> might be counterbalanced by mir- <dig> once they have the same seed sequence and consequently share the majority  of predicted targets . this assertion was further supported by a comparison of the frequency of shared targets for any two mirnas chosen at random to the frequency of targets shared by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  such analysis undoubtedly demonstrates that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> share larger portion of common targets than expected by chance .

we gathered additional evidence of exchange of function between mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> after mining published mirna sequencing datasets of several vertebrates  <cit> . from this review we noticed that mir- <dig> was highly and weakly expressed in cardiac muscle of mouse and lamprey, respectively, whilst mir- <dig> was highly expressed in zebrafish and zebra finch cardiac muscle .

hence, reconstruction of mir- <dig> evolutionary history remounts to a birth event of mir- <dig> in an ancient vertebrate lineage with its secondary loss on cartilaginous and ray-finned fish lineages and maintenance in the lineage that raises sarcopterygii and tetrapod lineages followed by a duplication event restricted to mammal genomes.

mir- <dig> duplication
in the comparative screening of the genomic context of muscle mirnas in vertebrates, we found that all non-fish species carry a single copy of mir- <dig> and its host gene dnm <dig>  in fish, however, a variable by-species pattern exists. for instance zebrafish, common carp, atlantic cod, coelacanth, spotted gar, cave fish and elephant shark follow the single copy pattern of non-fish species whilst platyfish, stickleback, medaka, fugu, tetraodon and nile tilapia possess two copies of mir- <dig> and dnm <dig>  this extra mirna copy turns out to be a novel paralog of mir- <dig>  henceforth called mir-214-par.

we then looked at the mir-214-par precursor sequences and verified that they were distinct to precursors of the canonical mir- <dig> by twelve to fifteen nucleotide substitutions in 90 bp nucleotide sequences. however, the predicted secondary structure of mir-214-par precursors mounts into a hairpin conformation consistent with the mirna biogenesis model , therefore denoting functionality to the paralog copy detected .figure  <dig> 
secondary structures of mir- <dig> and mir-214-par. the sequences of nile tilapia were used to demonstrate the hairpin structure of the paralogs. rainbow colored bar indicates the ligation probability between bases .



in the phylogenetic tree, all mir-214-par branched out together, founding an isolated clade from the canonical mir- <dig> . paralogs were closely related to their canonical counterparts, who formed a branch exclusively composed by fish species, further supporting the origin of paralogs restricted to the fish lineage. then, we can infer that mir-214-par derived from mir- <dig> by duplication and divergence, being secondarily lost in a few fish lineages. such findings are in agreement to an expected dynamic of a particular mirna gene evolving independently into different species  <cit> .figure  <dig>

our analysis suggests that the duplication event of mir- <dig> was restricted to medaka, stickleback, tetraodon, fugu, nile tilapia and platyfish. these species belong to the acanthopterygii superorder. on the other hand, zebrafish, common carp and cave fish belong to ostariophysi superorder, atlantic cod belongs to paracanthopterygii superorder, coelacanth belongs to sarcopterygii class and elephant shark belongs to chondrichthyes class. thereby, it indicates two possibly scenarios where  the duplication event occurred in a bony fish ancestor, and mir-214-par was lost in diverse lineages but kept in superorder acanthopterygii; or  the duplication event was specific to superorder acanthopterygii. the second scenario is more parsimonious due to loss of functional mirnas is extremely rare  <cit> .

moreover, the synteny analysis reveals that there is a block of seven genes  highly conserved between human, frog, zebrafish and other fish species. amid these genes, only suco and myoc were duplicated along with mir-214-par, while mettl <dig>  vamp <dig>  prrc2c and pigc were maintained neighboring the canonical mir- <dig> widely distributed in vertebrates. by contrast, only prdx <dig> gene was retained near of mir-214-par. furthermore, in fish species we observed that genes nearby mir-214-par were highly syntenic, excepting the jun gene that was solely retained in nile tilapia, medaka and stickleback genomes . conversely, the mir-214-par and mir- <dig> have shown poor synteny for their respective surrounding protein coding genes. for instance myoc, suco, ppapdc <dig> genes are maintained in synteny into both mir- <dig> variants, contrasting to the majority of remaining protein coding genes which have evolved distinctively after duplication. interestingly, the prdx <dig> gene that is located near to mir-214-par was exclusively held by those fish species carrying this mirna paralog copy.figure  <dig> 
schematic representation of the genomic organization and synteny analysis of mir- <dig> and its paralog detected on fish genomes. orthologous genes shared by the widely distributed copy are connected by black lines. orthologous genes shared by the paralog copy are connected by gray lines. the interrogation dot on 3’ region of stickleback indicates no detection of any gene once mir- <dig> and its host gene were detected on the region of the scaffold that are not anchored with other scaffold yet. genes represented above the midline are in sense strands, whereas those represented below are in antisense strands. “chr_” means chromosome and “s_” means scaffold.



therefore, we suggest that the intronic mir-214-par emerged by the duplication of its host gene dnm <dig>  followed by the transposition of both genes to another chromosome or scaffold. however, extra bioinformatics analyses including an analysis of mirnas from additional taxa, will be insightful to better endorse such hypothesis.

all the results presented here confirm the mir-214-par as a new paralog of mir- <dig> and highlight a duplication event restricted to superorder acanthopterygii, thus fostering the need for a new nomenclature to these mirna genes . besides such mirna gene duplication, we have identified several protein-coding genes also duplicated, retained in the vicinity. this finding demonstrates an evolutionary constraint as reflex of putative functional relationship.

evolutionary scenario of muscle mirnas in vertebrates
new data generated for nile tilapia coupled with available data on several species allows us to propose a general evolutionary scenario for muscle-enriched mirnas in vertebrates .figure  <dig> 
putative evolutionary scenario of muscle mirnas in vertebrates. the blue, pink and yellow areas represent the cenozoic, mesozoic and paleozoic eras, respectively. the gray square contains the legend for acquisition, duplication and deletion events. the bars on top and bottom  represent the timescale in million years.



in this hypothetical scenario a birth event of the clusterized and intronic mirna mir-1-2/-133a- <dig> took place on a common chordata ancestor  <cit> . subsequently, this cluster generated the intergenic cluster mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> by duplication and rearrangement events. another duplication of mir-1/-133a cluster must have occurred on a gnathostome ancestor, before the split of chondrichthyes, actinopterygii, sarcopterygii and tetrapoda lineages. then, this extra copy of the mir-1/-133a cluster probably acquired a function and was maintained in chondrichthyes, whereas it was converted into a novel mir-206/-133b cluster retained in the genome of the remaining vertebrate groups over evolution  <cit> . we also can propose that the mir-206/- <dig> cluster was just recently duplicated in zebrafish, because extra copies of this locus were not detected in any other vertebrate genome. furthermore, our survey suggests that a recent event of rare loss of the functional bicistronic mir-1-1/-133a- <dig> took place into a common ancestor of tetraodontiformes because both fugu and tetraodon species do not carry this mirna cluster in their genomes.

therefore, we can infer that the birth event that doubled mir- <dig> took place in a common vertebrate ancestor and was followed by a conversion of one locus of mir- <dig> into mir- <dig> in a bony fish common ancestor. this pattern was maintained in sarcopterygii and tetrapoda, but not in cartilaginous and ray-finned fish lineages that underwent the loss of the mir- <dig> but not of its host gene. moreover, we have found the mir- <dig> distributed in all  <dig> mammals examined, implying that the mir- <dig> and its host gene were duplicated on a mammal common ancestor only. such conclusion is strengthened by the absence of mir- <dig> in cartilaginous and ray-finned fishes, as well as by the existence of a unique mir- <dig> copy in sarcopterygii, birds, reptiles and amphibians.

regarding the mir- <dig>  all acquired data suggests that this myomir emerged and was retained under the same organizational pattern in actinopterygii and sarcopterygii. however, there are two peculiarities that might have happened for this mirna:  a recent double duplication of mir- <dig> and its host gene in zebrafish genome, since no similarities of this pattern were detected in other vertebrate genomes; and  the conversion from intronic to intergenic mir- <dig> in medaka and stickleback genomes, an event that might have occurred independently, as recently described for unrelated species atlantic cod and platyfish  <cit> .

for the mir- <dig>  we propose a gene-birth in a gnathostome common ancestor, because our deep genome search did not recover this mirna neither in lamprey  nor in any other basal chordate. additionally the highly conserved sequence and organizational pattern within all gnathostome species indicates that mir- <dig> would have experienced similar evolutionary pressures that kept it under strong selective constraint. moreover, a duplication event restricted to a common ancestor of acanthopterygii would explain the mir- <dig> paralogs in all members investigated from this superorder. overall, our analysis supports a scenario where the origin of mir- <dig> in vertebrate genomes took place during paleozoic and extant paralogs came out after a gene duplication event restricted to an acanthopterygii ancestor during mesozoic.

CONCLUSIONS
the high dynamism inherent to fish genomes helps to explain the variable pattern in the distribution of mirna genes but fails to explain the high synteny observed so far. in this work, we thoroughly studied the genomic organization and discussed the evolutionary dynamics and diverse remarkable singularities of muscle mirnas in fishes. we also show that, in spite of a few peculiarities and differences between species, some of the chromosomal regions that contain the muscle mirnas had high synteny levels, denoting colligated functionality. moreover, we conclude that most of events of muscle-specific mirnas acquisition and diversification occurred on a gnathostome common ancestor, whereas singular events of mirna duplication and loss were randomly assigned to distinct species of the divergent animal groups studied. collectively, these insights about the mirna genomic context shed new light on the evolutionary history of such key modulators of the muscle biology in vertebrates.
