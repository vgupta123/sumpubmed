BACKGROUND
geographically structured populations are the result of historical and/or contemporary demography. some of them may experience either little or no genetic contact for long periods of time, due to physical, ecological or geographical barriers . more recent and rapid events, such as extinction, introduction or fragmentation, often linked to human activities, may also produce spatially partitioned populations .

for european species, the quaternary glaciations are a major historical factor shaping the patterns of spatial population structure  <cit> . during these periods, the ice sheet induced the preservation of many species, but only in isolated refugia, resulting in population divergence via genetic drift and local selection  <cit> . the commonly recognized refugia in western europe during the quaternary glaciations are on the iberian and the italian peninsulas  <cit> . it has been suggested that the northern regions of europe were post-glacially colonized, generally from these refuges  <cit> . recent phylogeographic and biogeographic studies have uncovered multiple refugia in iberia . however, the number, location and habitat composition of these 'refugia in refugia' still remain poorly known. scenarios other than the northern expansion from southern refugia have also been proposed. on one hand, cold-tolerant species, such as mustela erminea  <cit> , could have naturally expanded their repartition range during the quaternary glaciations. on the other hand, the presence of additional putative refugia has been advanced to explain the distribution of poor cold-hardy species  <cit> . the hypothesis of local, but relatively recent and short-lived refugia much further north of the mediterranean refugia is concordant with the discontinuity of the pleistocene ice sheet in this region  <cit> . these temperate refugia are particularly recognized to explain the survival of some communities, such as freshwater fish  <cit> . the principal biome of unglaciated northern europe during the late pleistocene cold stages was the steppe tundra, i.e. a treeless vegetation type  <cit> . the presence of small isolated populations of trees in buffered local microclimates is also suspected in northwestern europe during the pleistocene; but, except for one controversial site in belgium  <cit> , no temperate forest refugia for animal species have actually been precisely localized in this part of europe. therefore, contemporary demographic factors are more likely to explain well-separated populations of poor cold-hardy species in western europe, such as human introductions , or the recent extinction of intermediate populations  <cit> .

the land snail elona quimperiana  is a western palearctic helicoidea species with a highly disjunct distribution limited to brittany in france  and northern spain . it is a so-called lusitanian species, i.e. a species that typically has a disjunct distribution in iberia and southwest ireland, with either no or highly disjunct populations in the regions between both areas   <cit> . elona quimperiana therefore provides an excellent opportunity to shed more light on european historical biogeography. this species lives in temperate and humid deciduous forests, where it feeds on mycelia found on rotten, dead stumps . occasionally, it is coprophagous and necrophagous  <cit> . like many other terrestrial gastropods, e. quimperiana has a relatively limited dispersal capacity and probably survived during the quaternary glaciations through significant fluctuations in its distribution area, just as its deciduous forest habitat did  <cit> . the present study is based on phylogeographical analyses that are highly successful in discriminating past and present demographic factors that were likely to have influenced the distribution of populations. the aims are to  describe the phylogeographical structure of e. quimperiana throughout its entire range, and  identify the refugia and the subsequent recolonization routes.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis
the length of 16s rdna sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, with a total of  <dig> substitutions, including two indels at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  while the length of the coi sequences was  <dig> bp, with a total of  <dig> substitutions. eleven haplotypes were identified among the  <dig> snails analyzed for the 16s gene: eight from spain, three from brittany, and one from the basque country. brittany had only one haplotype  in common with spain; this haplotype was the most frequent one, since  <dig> individuals shared it. twenty-three haplotypes were obtained for the coi gene among the  <dig> individuals analyzed: eleven from spain, six from brittany  and seven from the basque country. the most frequent haplotype , shared by more the half of the specimens, was also the only one common to both brittany and spain.

the networks based on the 16s rdna and coi sequences exhibited convergent results. the 16s network showed two haplogroups . hg <dig> comprised  <dig> haplotypes  that were scattered throughout spain and brittany. the most frequent haplotype in this group  is distributed throughout all of brittany  and occurs in the spanish provinces of lugo, asturias and western cantabria . all of the other hg <dig> haplotypes are represented by either a single or few specimens. haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are specific to brittany and were only found at bzh <dig>  and bzh <dig> . in spain, a total of seven private haplotypes were found in five out of six populations: haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were typical of sp <dig> , haplotype  <dig> was specific to sp <dig> , haplotype  <dig> was only found at sp <dig> , haplotype  <dig> was present in sp <dig> , and haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were typical for the cantabria province .

the second haplogroup, hg <dig>  comprised only one haplotype , which only occurred in basque snails from bqα  and bqβ .

the populations of the two haplogroups formed by coi sequences  are the same as those found in hg <dig> and hg <dig> . hga comprised  <dig> haplotypes , the most frequent of which was ha . the distribution of ha is comparable to that of h <dig>  since it is found in both brittany  and spain . all of the other hga haplotypes are represented by either a single or few specimens . the hb, hc, hj, hl and ho haplotypes are specific to brittany. most of the  <dig> haplotypes specific to spain are private. as for haplogroup hg <dig>  hgw exclusively comprised all of the basque snails and included seven private haplotypes .

the genetic diversity estimates are given in table  <dig>  obviously, both the haplotype and nucleotide diversities are much higher for both genes in the populations from spain , compared to those from brittany . while no variation is detected in the basque populations for the 16s region, the gene and nucleotide diversities are relatively high for the coi gene .

demographic analysis
hypotheses of demographic expansion were tested using fu's fs and ramos-onsins & rozas' r <dig> statistics . both tests yielded results that were consistent with a population expansion of both the hg <dig> and hga haplogroups, mainly driven by the significant expansion of the brittany populations. the unimodal distribution of pairwise differences among the brittany populations  and the non-significant raggedness index obtained from the mismatch distribution analyses  are consistent with a model of recent expansion  <cit> .

analyses are using fu's fs and ramos-onsins & rozas' r <dig> statistics, for the whole sample  and four subsets of e. quimperiana populations .

bayesian estimation of time to the most recent common ancestor
the molecular-clock likelihood ratio-tests  showed no significant variation of the substitution rate among the branches of both the coi and 16s phylogenies. for 16s, 2Δlogl =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig> ; for coi, 2Δlogl =  <dig> , df =  <dig>  p =  <dig>  with all codon positions, and 2Δlogl =  <dig> , d.f. =  <dig>  p =  <dig> , with the third-codon position only. applying divergence rates ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> % per myr for the third codon of coi, the most recent common ancestor of all of the e. quimperiana populations  would have lived between  <dig>  to  <dig>   myr ago . the tmrca, based on the coi-3rd base divergence rate, was estimated as being between  <dig>  and  <dig>  myr for the brittany-spain lineage and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  myr for the basque lineage. convergent time estimates were obtained for the brittany-spain clade with a  <dig> % rate of evolution for coi  and 2% for 16s . for the basque clade, while a divergence rate of  <dig> % for coi  leads to the same time value estimate , a four times lower divergence rate for 16s  yielded an equivalent time estimate. in spite of homogeneous substitution rates among the branches in the 16s phylogeny, the molecular clock does not seem to tick regularly.

results of bayesian analyses are based on 16s rrna and co <dig>  variation.

discussion
in spite of its name, an ancient iberian origin of elona quimperiana is obvious, as has been suggested earlier  <cit> . this is strongly supported by the observation that most of the mtdna diversity is found in spain, and by the fact that spanish haplotypes have a central position in both of the star-like sequence networks. our genetic comparison of populations from the two disjunct distribution areas of e. quimperiana reveals that the genetic differentiation does not mirror the large geographical discontinuity of the species range.

actually, the genetic divergences isolate the basque populations from a homogeneous genetic group comprising the spanish and brittany populations. both the 16s rdna and coi genes show specific basque haplotypes, forming separate clades in the two haplotype networks. the low level of genetic diversity, especially for the 16s gene, the occurrence of private haplotypes, and the peripheral location suggest that the basque populations may form a parapatric race  <cit> , although no morphological peculiarities could be detected. such peripheral populations frequently mark a threshold of environmental variation, beyond which the species cannot expand  <cit> . as the split between the basque and central spanish populations would have occurred between  <dig> myr to  <dig>  bp, it can be most easily interpreted by assuming that the species survived the pleistocene ice ages in separate glacial refugia on the iberian peninsula  <cit> . indeed, the occurrence of 'refugia within an iberian refugium' is now largely supported by data from a range of organisms. among the seven putative terrestrial refugia identified in this area, those located along the picos de europa  and in/or near the pyrenees  <cit>  coincide quite strikingly with the phylogeographic structure we obtained . our results thus support the spatial subdivision hypothesis of an iberian peninsula glacial refugia  <cit> , and help to refine the pyrenees refugium theory by suggesting the basque country as a refuge zone during the pleistocene glaciations. moreover, the presence of the closely related species norelona pyrenaica, which is endemic in the eastern pyrenees, where e. quimperiana does not live , suggests the occurrence of another separate refuge in this part of the pyrenees, which is probably influenced by mediterranean climates. contemporary anthropogenic effects may also influence the population structure of e. quimperiana since estimates of the split of the basque populations match glacial and postglacial times . recurrent bottlenecks, due to habitat fragmentation and the alteration of natural forest habitat in the basque country  <cit> , could have accentuated this genetic divergence . this could explain the discrepancies in the divergence time estimates between the two genetic markers, while a strong concordance has been observed in the divergence time estimates for other e. quimperiana lineages. by harboring distinct haplotypes, the basque country populations appear to be of great importance in terms of potential adaptation, long term persistence and hence, the conservation of e. quimperiana.

besides the strong genetic divergence of the basque lineage, the present results also show that in the spain-brittany lineage,  the genetic diversity is higher in spain,  the spanish and brittany populations share one common haplotype for each gene, which is, moreover, the most frequent in the two areas, and  the spanish populations are at demographic equilibrium, while the brittany ones would have experienced a recent expansion. three scenarios might be considered in order to explain the origin of brittany populations:  <dig> – a recent introduction by human activities,  <dig> – an ancient northward colonization preceding the last glacial period, as demonstrated for other lusitanian species  <cit> ,  <dig> – a spatial expansion after the last glacial maximum , also from native spanish populations  <cit> . in the first case, it is expected to have haplotypes in common with the source and introduced zones, as illustrated by 16s rdna-h <dig> and coi-ha. all of the other haplotypes found in brittany are specific to this area, suggesting that they probably appeared in brittany after an introduction. however, such post-introduction genetic diversification is more typical for species with high colonization capabilities, which is not the case for e. quimperiana  <cit> . moreover, related life history features, inconsistent with human activities or production, render multiple introductions improbable. all of these points make the first assumption rather unlikely.

the second hypothesis conforms to predictions of the effects of the ice ages on genetic variability in populations: populations with historical distributions in northern latitudes present lower genetic diversity, with fewer differentiated lineages, than southern populations . this has been demonstrated in other ectotherm species  <cit> . an ancient expansion of populations from iberia through france during the pleistocene interglacial periods may be plausible, since during these periods, the environmental conditions in western europe  were particularly favorable to e. quimperiana, all the more so given that oak was a dominant tree species  <cit> . under this hypothesis, a subset of southern haplotypes  would have expanded northward, while others  remained in the south. glaciations would have subsequently eradicated most of the e. quimperiana populations, except in the iberian refugia and in a northern refuge zone. indeed, small microenvironmentally favorable zones might have been created by oak trees in western europe  <cit> . according to paleoclimatic reconstructions, the local environmental conditions in close proximity to the arboreal vegetation were indeed warmer and more humid than regional simulations of the full-glacial climate  <cit> . within close proximity to the trees, poor cold-hardy flora and fauna were also able to survive the extremes of the lgm. it is also possible that the pleistocene refuge in northwestern france may involve caves, as suspected in belgium for other poor cold-hardy animals and deciduous trees  <cit> . elona quimperiana is indeed frequently observed in caves  <cit> , where it survives by coprophagous and necrophagous feeding.

unfortunately, our results cannot distinguish between the second and the third scenario. the latter implies a colonization of brittany after the last glaciations. as illustrated by oak  dispersal in great britain some  <dig> 000- <dig> years ago  <cit> , the oceanic climate of the west coast in france could have allowed a rapid spread of e. quimperiana from southern refugia to northern areas. since this snail is strongly associated with oak forests, its dispersal may follow the tree expansion pattern. human deforestation in intermediate areas between the basque country and brittany, around 1000- <dig> years ago, may have created induced open habitats that are hostile for e. quimperiana  <cit> , thus potentially explaining its present disjunct distribution.

there is no fossil record of e. quimperiana due to the extreme fragility of its thin shell. although the occurrence of a northern refugium should not be discarded a priori, an exhaustive sampling of the southern distribution range  where pleistocene refugia are obvious, appears necessary in order to clarify the colonization history of brittany by e. quimperiana.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results confirm the iberian origin of the land snail e. quimperiana and reveal a genetic differentiation separating a basque lineage from monophyletic clade grouping sequences from brittany and spain. divergence time estimates suggest the coexistence of these lineages in the iberian refugia during the lgm, and strongly support the hypothesis of 'refugia in refugia' during glaciations. the identification of iberian lineages allows the precision of the glacial refugia in the basque country and asturias locations. moreover, the species' ecology  allows researchers to sharpen their focus on the type of habitat present in these refugia during the glaciations. the scenario of a spatial expansion of e. quimperiana from the iberian refugia located in asturias to northern areas in france is the most probable for explaining the present distribution of the land snail. inferences based on a spatial genetic structure analysis should be helpful to discriminate between a pre-glacial expansion implying the existence of glacial refugia in brittany, or a post-glacial expansion followed by the human oak deforestation along the atlantic coast in france.
