BACKGROUND
largemouth bronze gudgeon  is a freshwater fish of the cyprinidae family, distributed in upstream regions of the yangtze river. it is of economic importance in china and the largest weight they can reach is  <dig>  kg  <cit> . the fish species is benthic and potamodromous and is typically found in river with torrential flow and they always live in cluster and produce pelagic eggs in flows from march to june every year  <cit> . however, the species has recently dramatically declined and is close to elimination  <cit>  due to overfishing and construction of hydroelectrically projects, which have blocked the migration routes, causing habitat fragmentation, and losses of spawning grounds and habitat destruction  <cit> .

over the recent years, the development of omics technologies has boosted our insights on the structure and function of the complex gastrointestinal  microbiota of fish . it has been revealed that colonization of microorganisms in the gi tract of fish results in the establishment of a symbiotic relationship between the host and gut microbiota  <cit> , and the fish gi microbiota can contribute to nutrition, health and development . in addition, the gi microbiota is important in the defense against adhesion and colonization of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the shaping of the fish intestinal microbiota is a complex process, and a number of factors have been reported to modulate its composition, e.g. host genetics, developmental stage, gut structure, environmental factors, diet and dietary components  <cit> . however, no information is available on the intestinal microbiota of largemouth bronze gudgeon, a fish species of economic importance in of the yangtze river.

the ongoing positive growth trend of the ecological protection and species conservation is expected to continue, reflecting the rising demand for largemouth bronze gudgeon rearing in indoor tanks to carry artificial reproduction. considering the important roles of intestinal microbiota during fish life, the aims of the present study were to elucidate the intestinal bacterial community of wild caught male and female largemouth bronze gudgeon with different body weight from yangtze river by sequencing of 16s rrna genes. the evaluation of sex-dependent effects the gut microbiota is of importance to study as less information is available on aquatic animal  <cit>  compared to endothermic animals . the results of the present study may be vital for successful propagation of the fish in indoor artificial culture as well as the influence of gender on drug delivery as discussed by freire et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
we obtained  <dig>  valid sequences from the  <dig> fish intestines. after quality filtering and normalization; totally  <dig>  high-quality bacterial sequences were obtained, equivalent to an average of  <dig>  reads per sample, when representative sequences were classified using rdp classifier. we calculated the number of operational taxonomical units , and they were analyzed for each sample with a 97 % sequence similarity cutoff value. figure  <dig> shows the rarefaction curve at an otu definition of 97 % identity. the good’s coverage of the four samples ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> rarefaction analysis of miseq sequencing reads of the 16s rrna gene in different fish samplings with different body weight. rarefaction curves at a cutoff level of 3 % were constructed at a 97 % sequence similarity cutoff value. s: small fish, m: medium fish, l: large fish

discussion
previous studies on largemouth bronze gudgeon, a cyprinidae, have focused on its genetic diversity and stress responds  <cit> , while no information is available on the intestinal microbiota. this topic needs to be evaluated as the intestinal microbiota of endothermic animals as well as fish plays a crucial role to the host  <cit> , and knowledge of the intestinal microbiota and its modulation in largemouth bronze gudgeon may be of importance to understand wild fish viability under cultured conditions as reported for sea bream   <cit> .

the non-significant difference in bacterial diversity by the shannon and inverse simpson diversity indexes between fish with different body weight , indicate that different fish body weights had no effect on intestinal microbiota of largemouth bronze gudgeon; probably due to similar habitats.

in a study with common carp , li et al.  <cit>  reported a core gut microbiota of fusobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and firmicutes but this is inconsistent with the core gut microbiota: proteobacteria and tenericutes of largemouth bronze gudgeon revealed in the present study, although the fish species belong to the same family; omnivores and benthic life. one possible reason for this difference may be that largemouth bronze gudgeon is omnivores but prefer animal food in nature environment contradict to common carp  <cit> . it is reported that the intestinal microbiota associated with host trophic level, and the intestinal bacterial diversity decrease in herbivores to omnivores to carnivores’ fish species .

the intestinal bacterial community between male and female largemouth bronze gudgeon was different in the present study, which is in accordance with iehata et al.  <cit> , revealing difference in both bacterial community and bacterial nutritional enzyme activity between female and male chilean octopus . moreover, endothermic animals studies have also revealed that the gut microbiota composition between gender are different . the difference in gut microbiota between sexes, may be hormones associated with each sex that might affect the composition of the gut microbiota  <cit> . different feed preference may be another reason for the variations in the intestinal microbiota, as the fish were sampled during different month during the season. in addition, the water temperature may influence the feeding behavior and gut microbiota. however, male and female fish sampled from different sampling times showed no variations within group in the present study. in their review, freire et al.  <cit>  discussed the influence of gender on gastrointestinal physiology and drug delivery. whether the results of the present study may be of importance for drug delivery in fish is not known and merits investigation.

intestinal bacteria can serve the host in two ways: they can represent a nutrient source and/or contribute with enzymes that may improve host digestion  <cit> . previous studies, revealed that some strains of genera aeromonas and pseudomonas produced amylase efficiently in freshwater fish, and this finding suggest that the intestinal microbiota may play an important role to the host  <cit> . in the present study, the genera aeromonas and pseudomonas were dominant in male and female largemouth bronze gudgeon, but no significant difference was revealed. whether these bacteria species contribute to the fish nutrition is a topic for further investigation.

it is of interest to note that the most dominant genus in male and female largemouth bronze gudgeon was unclassified bacteria  and mycoplasma , respectively, which is different to the findings reported for other freshwater fish species  <cit> . ringø et al.  <cit>  showed that the abundance of enterobacteriaceae were affected by protein sources. this may be of interest as some members of enterobacteriaceae have been reported to benefit metabolic activity; saccharolytic and utilizing acetate, while other members of the family are potentially opportunistic pathogens  <cit> . whether the protein sources for male and female fish development were different and what’s the function of these unclassified bacteria merit further investigation. genus mycoplasma is reported as pathogens for human, animals and plants  <cit> . however, holben et al.  <cit>  detected a novel mycoplasma phylotype which comprised for approximately 96 % of the total microbes in the distal intestine of wild atlantic salmon , which were substantially different from those indicated in pen-raised salmon from scotland and norway. moreover, the authors speculate the mycoplasma species could utilize cytoplasmic secretions from the host and produce lactic and acetic acids which subsequently utilized by other bacteria in wild salmon intestine. considering the significantly  increase in abundance of genus mycoplasma in female largemouth bronze gudgeon, some special metabolic activity may exist in female fish.

genus shewanella, which have been isolated from marine environments  <cit> , were detected at a significantly  higher abundance in male largemouth bronze gudgeon in the present study. this finding may be of importance as several strains of genus shewanella have previously been reported to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . as the predominant genera in largemouth bronze gudgeon were more similar to atlantic salmon than common carp, similar family as largemouth bronze gudgeon, this topic requires further evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed that the intestinal microbial community in wild largemouth bronze gudgeon sampled from the yalong river, had a core intestinal microbiota: phyla proteobacteria and tenericutes regardless of different body weight. in addition, it is of interest to notice that difference occurs in the intestinal bacterial community between male and female fish, which may due to the various metabolic activities in male and female fish. the results of the present study increase our understanding of the microbial ecosystem diversity in an endangered fish species. furtherly, understanding the associations between the structure and function of intestinal bacterial communities and body ecosystem parameters is important for determining the fish’s physical condition, and such information will also contribute to optimize breeding regimes and improve the health of endangered fish species in captivity.
