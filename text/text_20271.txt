BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  and the metabolic syndrome are characterized by resistance to the action of insulin in peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose. activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma  improves insulin sensitivity and lowers circulating levels of glucose, triglycerides and free fatty acids without stimulating insulin secretion in rodent models of t2d  <cit> . pparγ agonists also alleviate peripheral insulin resistance in humans, and have been effectively used in treatment of t2d patients  <cit> . fatty acid binding protein, adipocyte lipid binding protein and lipoprotein lipase are response genes of pparγ and are indicators for in vivo pparγ activation in adipose tissue  <cit> .

adiponectin, an adipose-specific plasma protein, possesses insulin sensitizing and anti-atherogenic properties  <cit> . it has been well documented that plasma adiponectin is lower in obese subjects than in lean subjects, lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients  <cit> , and is negatively correlated with body weight, visceral fat mass, and resting insulin level  <cit> . hotta et al also reported that adiponectin decreased in parallel with the progression of t2d in rhesus monkeys, and there is a strong correlation between plasma adiponectin and systemic insulin sensitivity  <cit> . studies by maeda et al showed that adiponectin knockout mice developed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia while on hf diet, which was reversed by adenoviral-mediated adiponectin expression  <cit> . exogenous adiponectin also lowered hepatic glucose production during a pancreatic euglycemic clamp  <cit> , and increased post-absorptive insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output  <cit> . the pparγ agonist, class of insulin sensitizer, has the marked effect of up-regulating serum adiponectin. combs et al reported that the pparγ agonist rosiglitazone increased plasma adiponectin in db/db mice  <cit> . yang et al reported rosiglitazone increased plasma levels of adiponectin in type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit> . tschritter et al analyzed the associations between plasma adiponectin and insulin sensitivity and serum lipid parameters in nondiabetic individuals, and concluded that plasma adiponectin predicts insulin sensitivity of both glucose and lipid metabolism  <cit> .

while pparγ agonists increase plasma adiponectin and adiponectin levels predict insulin sensitivity, there is not a clear demonstration of the relationships among pparγ agonist-increased adiponectin and pparγ agonist-mediated efficacy on insulin sensitivity/in vivo pparγ activation. therefore, the current studies were designed to define these relationships and assess serum adiponectin as a biomarker for in vivo pparγ activation and pparγ agonist-induced efficacy on insulin sensitization and lipid lowering.

RESULTS
high fat/sucrose  diet induced changes in sd rats
rats on the hf diet for  <dig> weeks showed marked insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, indicated by significant increases in postprandial serum levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, and area under curve  for serum insulin during ogtt. but the hf diet did not cause changes in postprandial serum glucose or ogtt glucose auc compared with rats on normal diet, consistent with an insulin resistant, pre-diabetic phenotype. serum adiponectin level in rats on hf diet was slightly higher than that in normal diet rats at week  <dig>  but back to the same level at week  <dig> .

pparγ agonist on adiponectin in sd rats
as showed in fig.  <dig>  treatment of sd rats on hf diet with gi <dig> for  <dig> weeks dose-dependently increased serum adiponectin, and upregulated adipose fabp <dig> mrna without effect on housekeeper genes 18s, β-actin, and cyclophilin. there was a positive correlation between adipose fabp <dig> mrna and serum adiponectin . a marked increase in serum adiponectin was also observed in gw347845-treated hf fed sd rats .

pparγ agonist-increased serum adiponectin and pparγ agonist-mediated efficacy on insulin sensitivity and lipid lowering
treatment of rats on hf diet with gi <dig> for  <dig> weeks significantly decreased the diet-induced elevations in postprandial serum triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, and insulin auc in a dose-dependent manner . treatment with gw <dig> showed a qualitatively similar effect to that of gi <dig> treatment . there were negative correlations for adiponectin versus triglycerides, free fatty acids, insulin, and insulin auc .

pparγ agonists in zucker rats
compared with zucker lean rats, zdf rats had higher serum insulin, glucose, tg, ffa, but similar serum adiponectin levels. treatment of zdf rats with pparγ agonist pioglitazone or gw <dig> for  <dig> weeks resulted in significantly lower serum glucose, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and modestly lower serum insulin, compared to vehicle treatment. both pioglitazone and gw <dig> markedly increased serum adiponectin in zdf rats . there were also negative correlations for serum adiponectin versus glucose, tg, ffa .

discussion
adiponectin possesses insulin sensitizing and anti-atherogenic properties  <cit> . in most clinical reports, primate studies, and genetic models, serum adiponectin level had been reported to be negatively correlated with body weight, visceral fat mass, and resting insulin level  <cit> . the present study showed that rats fed a hf diet had significantly higher serum insulin and lipids with in  <dig> weeks, which indicates insulin resistance. however, serum adiponectin level was not decreased by the diet up to  <dig> weeks. we have subsequently kept rats on the hf diet for up to  <dig> weeks, and observed a slight increase  in serum adiponectin level . our data may suggest that the hf diet-induced insulin resistance happened much early than diet-induced change in serum adiponectin. our data is consistent with studies by naderali ek et al  <cit> . in their report,  <dig> weeks of high fat/glucose diet resulted in significantly higher body weight, fat pad masses, plasma leptin, and higher plasma level of adiponectin, besides higher levels of plasma tg and ffa.

pparγ is a member of the ppar family of the nuclear receptor superfamily  <cit> . pparγ agonists increase insulin sensitivity and circulating adiponectin  <cit> . the response genes of pparγ for in vivo pparγ activation include lpl, ap <dig> and fabp <dig>  <cit> . the current study demonstrated that as in other species the pparγ agonist gi <dig> upregulated serum adiponectin level and adipose fabp <dig> mrna level in sd rats in a dose-dependent manner. interestingly, there is a positive correlation between pparγ full agonist-upregulated serum adiponectin level and adipose fabp <dig> mrna level, demonstrating the serum adiponectin level could be a biomarker for in vivo pparγ activation.

we did perform parallel experiments to check mrna levels of pparγ response genes fabp <dig>  ap <dig> and lpl in epididymal fat. we found that basal level of fabp <dig> mrna was very low compared to ap <dig> and lpl , and that pparγ agonist gi <dig> dose-dependently increased fabp <dig> mrna. ap <dig> was abundant in epididymal fat tissues, and was only slightly increased by gi <dig> in a non-dose-dependent manner . lpl was decreased in high fat diet fed rats, which was reversed by gi <dig> but not dose-dependently . with in vivo chronic exposure, the effect of pparγ agonists on gene expression is difficult to separate from the effects on differentiation. in general we find ap <dig> a better marker of adipocyte differentiation than pparγ activation. since pparγ agonist-mediated action in vivo may vary with organs/tissues   <cit>  and duration of treatment, all pparγ response genes may not be changed in the same manner in one tissue following chronic treatment. therefore the authors consider that the dose-dependently gi <dig> upregulated fabp <dig> mrna in epididymal fat caught in the present study is of value for quantitative in vivo pparγ activation. thus the correlation data using fabp <dig> mrna is of value.

adiponectin has been demonstrated to have an insulin sensitizing effect  <cit> . circulating adiponectin levels were positively correlated with insulin sensitivity, measured both by an euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and estimated by an oral glucose tolerant test, were negatively correlated with fasting lipids  <cit> . the pparγ agonist rosiglitazone increased plasma level of adiponectin, decreased fasting plasma glucose and hba1c, and ameliorated insulin resistance in type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit> . however, the relationship between pparγ agonist-increased circulating adiponectin and pparγ agonist-induced efficacy on insulin resistance has not been studied. the current study showed that pparγ agonists increased serum levels of adiponectin, ameliorated insulin resistance and lipid profile in both diet-induced insulin resistant rats and zdf rats. there is a correlation between pparγ agonist-increased serum adiponectin level and pparγ agonist-induced efficacy in insulin sensitivity/lipid lowering. these data provide a link between pparγ agonist-elevated circulating adiponectin level and pparγ agonist-mediated efficacy in insulin sensitivity and lipid lowering, and indicate that serum adiponectin level could be a biomarker for in vivo pparγ efficacy.

other adipokines, such as leptin, are important in obesity and insulin resistance. unlike adiponectin, leptin is positively correlated with fat amount, mass and percentage  <cit> . it has been reported that pparγ agonists inhibit the expression and function of leptin  <cit> . our unpublished study showed that high fat diet resulted in insulin resistance and higher serum leptin level in rats. treatment of these insulin resistant rats with pparγ agonist gw <dig> improved insulin sensitivity, but did not affect serum leptin level. therefore leptin is not considered to be a marker for pparγ efficacy. there are indices for in vivo pparγ activation , or for in vivo pparγ efficacy on insulin sensitization . these indices can not be used to represent both in vivo pparγ activation and in vivo pparγ efficacy on insulin sensitization. it is well known that circulating adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity  <cit> , is decreased in t2d patients  <cit> , and is negatively correlated with insulin resistance  <cit> ; pparγ agonists increase insulin sensitivity as well as circulating adiponectin  <cit> . the correlations, serum adiponectin vs adipose fabp <dig> mrna and serum adiponectin vs insulin/lipids, in our study demonstrated that serum adiponectin is a good biomarker for both in vivo pparγ activation and in vivo pparγ efficacy on insulin sensitization.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrated that in both diet-induced and genetic rat models of insulin resistant  syndrome the full pparγ agonists gi <dig>  gw <dig>  and pioglitazone significantly elevated serum adiponectin levels, increased adipose transcription of the pparγ response gene fabp <dig>  and were efficacious as expected. this is the first demonstration of correlation among pparγ agonist-increased serum adiponectin, pparγ agonist response gene mrna, and pparγ agonist-mediated efficacy in insulin sensitivity and lipid lowering. these data indicate that serum adiponectin can serve as a biomarker for both in vivo pparγ activation and pparγ agonist-induced efficacy in rats.
