BACKGROUND
in the mammalian neocortex , neurons with striking morphological and functional diversity are organized radially in six layers, and tangentially into numerous functional domains. only recently have the molecular and cellular mechanisms that guide the process of corticogenesis responsible for this organization begun to be resolved  <cit> . the main source of cortical projection neurons is the population of pluripotent radial glial progenitors , which divide asymmetrically at the apical surface of the ventricular zone  and generate both neuronal and glial progeny  <cit> . after midgestation, rg generate neuronal progenitors, termed intermediate or basal progenitors , that divide symmetrically at the basal surface of the vz and in the subventricular zone . thus, while the asymmetric division of rg progenitors gives rise to progeny with distinct cell fates, the symmetric division of bps primarily modulates the number of cells in previously established neuronal cell lineages  <cit> . the projection neurons of the lower  and upper  layers are generated predominantly from early  or late  progenitors in the two germinative zones, vz and svz, respectively. although generated during a specific developmental window, each neuronal layer consists of molecularly distinct neuronal subtypes that arise sequentially  <cit> . for instance, the majority of layer  <dig> neurons that extend corticospinal projections express the transcription factor, er <dig>  <cit> , while another set of layer  <dig> neurons, marked by the expression of the homeodomain transcription factor, otx <dig>  make connections with the superior colliculus and pons  <cit> . thus, laminar fate is presumably determined not only by the timing of neuronal origin during distinct developmental stages, a process controlled by environmental cues  <cit> , but is also critically dependent on intrinsic mechanisms that control the molecular phenotype of the neuronal sublineages  <cit> . the mechanisms that control the restricted expression of molecular determinants in distinct classes of neurons during corticogenesis remain unknown. our previous results, as well as those of other groups, have indicated that neurogenic rg progenitors are intrinsically specified by the expression of pax <dig>  <cit> . in the absence of pax <dig>  as exemplified by pax6/small eye homozygous  embryos, cortical progenitors produce less than half the normal number of neurons; conversely, retroviral-mediated pax <dig> overexpression in cortical progenitors in vitro results in expanded production of neuronal progeny  <cit> . pax <dig> is strongly expressed in early progenitors and, although it directly regulates the activity of the neuronal determination gene, ngn <dig>  <cit> . ngn2- and pax6-controlled genetic programs appear to specifically and separately determine the neuronal fate of lower and upper neurons  <cit> . thus, ngn <dig> knock out  and sey/sey embryos exhibit selective misspecification of lower and upper cortical layer neurons, respectively  <cit> . intriguingly, however, in the absence of pax <dig>  cortical progenitors fail to express the layer 5-specific marker, er <dig>  which instead exhibits enhanced ectopic expression in the svz  <cit> . we have noted qualitatively similar mispatterning of er <dig> expression in the rostrolateral cortex in the cortex-specific conditional pax <dig> ko mice at juvenile and adult stages , prompting us to examine possible genetic interactions between the two transcription factors, pax <dig> and er <dig> 

here we report the identification of a 2-kb promoter sequence of the mouse er <dig> gene that drives er <dig> expression in a subpopulation of cortical layer  <dig> neurons. we demonstrate that pax <dig> directly controls er <dig> activity in both cortical progenitors and in a subset of layer  <dig> projection neurons. the results further suggest that the cell fate specification of er81-positive layer  <dig> neurons in the rostrolateral cortex is a pax6-dependent process.

RESULTS
pax <dig> binds to the putative er <dig> promoter
dna sequences with significant gene regulatory functions are highly conserved during evolution. a comparison of the er <dig> locus from mouse, rat, chimpanzee and human revealed the existence of a highly conserved sequence of approximate  <dig> kb in the 5' region of the putative er <dig> promoter. to identify potential pax <dig> consensus binding sites  <cit>  in this region, we utilized the sequence analysis package gcg  <cit> . we discovered three potential pax <dig> binding sites located at positions - <dig> to  <dig>  - <dig> to  <dig>  and - <dig> to  <dig> upstream of the mouse er <dig> gene, each of which contained three, four or five mis-matches relative to the consensus pax <dig> binding sequence  <cit> . using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  and in vitro-translated pax <dig> protein, we examined pax <dig> binding to these three potential binding sites. the results indicate that pax <dig> bound with low affinity to the pax <dig> binding site at position - <dig> to - <dig>  but not to any of the other putative sites . to determine whether this low-affinity binding was specific, we pre-incubated binding mixtures with an anti-pax <dig> antibody and found that protein-bound, radiolabeled probes were supershifted, confirming the presence of a dna-pax <dig> protein-pax <dig> antibody complex . pax <dig> binding was also completely abolished after mutating the binding site sequence in the er <dig> promoter . together, these findings indicate that pax <dig> interacts specifically with the -1190- <dig> regulatory sequence of the er <dig> promoter.

to determine whether this binding site is occupied by pax <dig> protein in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays using mouse e <dig>  cortical extracts. a 282-bp fragment located at - <dig> to - <dig> of the er <dig> promoter encompassing the pax <dig> binding site was precipitated from chromatin by the pax <dig> antibody , but not by pre-immune serum  or gfp antibody . furthermore, the pax <dig> antibody was not able to precipitate a control chromatin fragment isolated from a region outside of the putative er <dig> promoter . these data indicate that pax <dig> protein binds specifically to the putative er <dig> promoter both in vitro and in vivo.

significantly, the identified pax <dig> binding site is also present in the 2-kb upstream-region of the er <dig> gene of mouse, rat, chimpanzee and human  and in zebrafish  <cit> , suggesting that this binding site is evolutionally conserved.

cell type-dependent regulation of er <dig> promoter activity
we next used deletion analysis to determine the minimal sequence requirements for er <dig> promoter activity. a  <dig> -kb fragment from the 5' region of the mouse er <dig> gene and a series of deletion fragments were subcloned into luciferase reporter plasmids and transfected into mouse primary embryonic  cortical cell cultures, as described below . the er81-luc construct , containing a 2-kb region of genomic dna upstream of the er <dig> translation initiation codon, was most active in subsequent luciferase assays.

to assess the ability of pax <dig> to activate the er <dig> promoter, we transfected hela cells, which lack endogenous pax <dig>  <cit> , with er81-luc alone  or together with the pax6-expression plasmid, cmv-pax <dig> . the control cells exhibited very low basal levels of luciferase activity, whereas co-transfection of er81-luc with increasing amounts of cmv-pax <dig> led to robust, concentration-dependent increases in luciferase activity .

to determine whether pax <dig> is also able to activate the er <dig> promoter in vivo, we performed in ovo co-electroporation experiments. er81-luc and cmv-pax <dig> constructs , were electroporated into the hindbrain of hamburger and hamilton  stage 11â€“ <dig> chick embryos. after  <dig> days, embryos were examined immunohistochemically for expression of pax <dig>  gfp and luciferase reporter. after the forced expression of pax <dig> in vz progenitors of the hindbrain, a marked expression of the er81-luciferase reporter was detected as compared to the controls . in developing neural tube er <dig> is expressed endogenously only in differentiated motor and proprioceptive sensory neurons, including a subpopulation of neurons of the inferior olive in the hindbrain  <cit> . upon electroporation, the injection in the forth ventricle, dna  is incorporated in vz progenitors and their descendents, seen as strongly luciferase-positive cells leaving the neural tube . consistent results were also obtained when the forced expression of pax <dig> was tagged predominantly into the isthmic region, normally being negative for endogenous pax <dig> expression . together, these results indicate that forced expression of pax <dig> can trans-activate the er <dig> promoter in both, a cell culture system and a live embryo.

to further examine the functional significance of the single pax <dig> binding site identified in the er <dig> promoter, we mutated the site in the er81-luc plasmid from the original 5' cccgct 3' sequence to 5' ctcgag 3', which does not bind pax <dig>  generating the er81-luc plasmid . we then used a reporter assay to assess the pax6-dependent transactivation of both wild type and mutated constructs. accordingly, hela cells were transfected with er81-luc or er81-luc with or without cotransfection of the pax <dig> expression construct, cmv-pax <dig>  as expected, the activity of the wild-type promoter construct was enhanced by pax <dig> overexpression, which increased luciferase activity almost 20-fold compared to the reporter activity in control cells. mutation of the pax6-binding site in the putative er <dig> promoter completely abolished pax6-dependent activity in the reporter assay . these data suggest that, in pax6-transfected hela cells, a single biologically active pax6-binding site in the er <dig> promoter is sufficient to support full promoter activity.

to study how the occupation of the binding site by pax <dig> in the er <dig> promoter is influenced by the presence of endogenous proteins intrinsic to progenitor cells, we evaluated er <dig> promoter activity in primary embryonic  cortical cultures. more that 90% of the rc2+ rg progenitors express pax <dig> at this stage  <cit> . the cells were electroporated with either er81-luc, er81-luc or empty pgl <dig> plasmid  and cultured for  <dig> days in vitro  in a chemically defined culture medium . under these conditions, progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation in vitro mimic in vivo neurogenesis  <cit> . notably, in contrast to pax6-transfected hela cells, where transfection of the er81-luc construct completely abolished er <dig> promoter activity, approximately 42% of the residual luciferase activity remained in primary cortical cultures transfected with this mutant promoter construct . these findings indicate that the pax6-binding site in the er <dig> promoter is an important, but possibly not the sole, cis-acting element responsible for regulating the activity of the er <dig> promoter in cortical primary cultures.

pax <dig> is expressed in rg progenitors, but is also present in some differentiated neurons in the adult brain, including some amygdalar nuclei  <cit> . upon differentiation, primary cortical cultures contain a mixture of progenitors and different cell types, including neurons and glial cells. to examine the function of the pax <dig> binding site identified in the er <dig> promoter in a homogeneous neuronal cell population, we performed er <dig> reporter assays using the neuronal cell line, neuro-2a, which expresses little or no pax <dig>  <cit> . neuro-2a cells were transfected with either er81-luc, er81-luc or pgl <dig> constructs and cultured for  <dig> days. in agreement with the results obtained in primary cortical cells, transfection of neuro-2a cells with the er81-luc construct caused almost a four-fold increase in luciferase reporter activity compared to that in pgl3-transfected control cultures . remarkably, and in contrast to the experiments with pax6-transfected hela cells and mixed primary cortical cultures, transfection of neuro-2a cells with er81-luc construct had no effect on er <dig> promoter activity . as noted above, pax <dig> binds with low affinity to the er <dig> promoter, suggesting that high levels of pax <dig> expression may be required to exert transcriptional control on er <dig>  under the culture conditions used, pax <dig> expression in mixed primary cortical cultures is restricted to the rg progenitors cells. collectively, these findings strongly suggest that the pax <dig> binding site identified in the er <dig> promoter is essential for activation of er <dig> in cortical progenitors, while regulation of er <dig> expression in neuronal cells may depend on other factors.

the 2-kb er <dig> promoter sequence drives appropriate expression of er <dig> in the cortex of er81cre transgenic mice
to obtain definitive evidence that the promoter sequences identified in the er <dig> gene is capable of correctly driving the endogenous expression of er <dig> in the developing brain, we developed an er81cre transgenic mouse. this line expresses a dna construct containing a  <dig> -kb fragment of the er <dig> promoter placed downstream of a human Î²-globin minimal promoter, followed by a cre recombinase dna sequence, and ires and gfp reporter sequences . er81cre transgenic mice were crossed with mice from a reporter line, gtrosa26tm1sho  <cit> , which contain a loxp-flanked dna sequence of "stopper" fragment positioned upstream of the Î²-galactosidase-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion gene . Î²-geo is expressed only after cre-mediated excision of loxp-flanked dna sequences, and thus double-reporter transgenic gtrosa26tm1sho/cre lines provide a region-specific report of the occurrence of cre excision by the specific cre line used  <cit> . the analysis of lacz activity at e <dig>  in different er81cre;gtrosa26tm1sho double-transgenic founders revealed expression of the reporter in the vz and layer  <dig> of the cortex, striatum, piriform cortex and olfactory bulb, a result that is in agreement with the known pattern of er <dig> expression in the mouse telencephalon . we therefore conclude that the 2-kb er <dig> promoter region is necessary and sufficient for er <dig> expression in the mouse telencephalon.

discussion
accumulating evidence suggests that the process of cortical layering, during which progenitor cells in the vz and svz generate neurons destined to specific cortical layers, depends on both the temporal sequence of progenitor cell origination during a specific developmental stage and the expression of layer-determinant genes. in addition, neurons of a specific layer exhibit diversity in number, morphology and axonal connectivity across different functional domains of the cortex. thus, the two fundamental processes of corticogenesis, layering and arealization, seem to be closely related. according to the current view, the functional regionalization of the cortex involves intrinsic mechanisms, controlled by the combinatorial expression of transcription factor gradients in the progenitors, and extrinsic cues provided by the ingrowing thalamocortical axons at late developmental stages and after birth  <cit> .

in the developing cortex, pax <dig> is expressed in rg progenitors in a rostrolateral-high to caudomedial-low gradient  <cit>  and plays essential roles in cortical neurogenesis, and arealization and layer formation  <cit> . accordingly, abolishing pax <dig> function leads to defects in cortical molecular regionalization as observed in the pax6/small eye brain, where the rostral cortical area shrinks and caudal areas expand  <cit> . furthermore, there is a decrease in the number of neurons in the pax6-defficient cortex, in which the neuronal subsets of the upper cortical layers appear to be specifically missing  <cit> . in the current study, we provide the first evidence that pax <dig> may determine the neuronal identity of subsets of layer  <dig> projection neurons by controlling the expression of er <dig> in pallial progenitors.

er <dig> is a member of the pea <dig> subfamily of the ets transcription factor family  <cit>  that is expressed in cortical progenitors at the mid- to late stages of neocortical development in mouse  <cit> , rat and monkey  <cit> . in the mouse cortex, er <dig> transcripts are first detected at e <dig> in the vz of the rostrolateral pallium; expression is maintained in a subset of the pyramidal cells in the lower part of layer  <dig> in later embryonic stages and in the mature brain.  <cit> . ets proteins have been shown to contribute to the specification of various cell types in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . the documented role of er <dig> in the specification of dendritic arborization of proprioceptive sensory neurons in the spinal cord  <cit>  suggests the possibility that er <dig> might be involved in the neuronal subtype specification of projection neurons in the cortex  <cit> . similar to pax <dig>  er <dig> is also expressed in a prominent, graded manner in pallial progenitors, reaching its highest levels in the rostrolateral cortex  <cit> . in the absence of pax <dig>  er <dig> expression in the vz of the rostrolateral cortex  is essentially undetectable, both in sey/sey mutant  <cit>  and in the juvenile cortex of the conditional cortex-specific pax6ko mutant, . we show here that pax <dig> binds with low affinity to a single binding site in the er <dig> promoter, and further show that pax <dig> protein produces dose-dependent increases in the activity of this promoter. collectively, these findings suggest that pax <dig> controls the generation of er81+ layer  <dig> neurons in a dose- and region-specific manner, predominantly in the motor and frontoparietal cortex. remarkably, similar region- and dose-dependent regulation of er <dig> expression by the neurogenic factor, ngn <dig>  was demonstrated in ngn2-ko mice, in which er <dig> expression is specifically affected only in the rostral cortex  <cit> . ngn <dig> is a direct pax <dig> downstream target gene whose expression is regulated by high levels of pax <dig> expression only in progenitors of the rostral pallium  <cit> . additional experiments will be required to determine whether er <dig> expression in the rostrolateral cortex is regulated coordinately by pax <dig> and ngn <dig> or, alternatively, whether er <dig> acts as a downstream regulator in the pax6-ngn <dig> pathway.

we found that the pax6-binding site identified in the 2-kb promoter fragment of er <dig> was necessary for full activation of the er <dig> promoter by pax <dig> in pax6-transfected-hela cells. however, mutation of the pax6-binding site only partially reduced er <dig> promoter activity in primary cortical cell cultures and had no effect in neurons of the neuro-2a cell line. given that at 3div, cortical primary cultures consist of approximately  <dig> % progenitors and 55% differentiated neurons  <cit> , these findings suggest that activation of er <dig> depends primarily on pax <dig> transcriptional control in cortical progenitors, but activation/maintenance of er <dig> expression in differentiated neurons possibly involves other regulatory factors. to identify such potential factors, we performed an in silico search for potential upstream binding sites and identified multiple binding sites for the transcription factors, rest/nrsf and brn <dig>  both of which are important in cortical neurogenesis  <cit> . these transcription factors could be important for activation and/or maintenance of er <dig> expression in cortical progenitors and subsets of differentiated neurons.

it is interesting to note that both pax6- and ngn2-dependent expression of er <dig> in rg progenitors in vivo is confined to progenitors of the rostrolateral cortex. to confirm the functional significance of the pax6-dependent control sequence identified in the er <dig> promoter, we developed a transgenic mouse line in which the  <dig> kb er <dig> promoter region was placed upstream of a cre recombinase sequence. a detailed analysis of the resulting er81cre line is a subject of a separate study. results obtained thus far indicate, however, that the expression of the lacz reporter in er81cre:gtrosa26tm1sho double-transgenic mice faithfully reproduces the known expression pattern of er <dig> in the developing telencephalon, including vz progenitors and subpopulations of l <dig> neurons, striatum, piriform cortex and olfactory bulb  as well as in the whole caudal pallium depends on combinatorial control by pax <dig> and other transcription factors. such simultaneous binding of pax <dig> and the transcription factors, sox <dig> and maf, in the Î´-crystallin and glucagon promoters, respectively, significantly increases pax <dig> transactivation ability  <cit> . together, these findings strongly suggest that an evolutionarily conserved genetic interplay between pax <dig> and er <dig> is involved in the regional specification of progenitor identity in the developing cortex.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we have shown that a direct genetic interaction between the transcription factors, pax <dig> and er <dig>  in cortical vz may be involved in the regional specification of neuronal subtype identity of a set of layer  <dig> projection neurons. the low-affinity binding of pax <dig> to the 2-kb er <dig> promoter suggests that only the high endogenous levels of pax <dig> in progenitors of the rostrolateral cortex are capable of regulating er <dig> promoter activity, an interpretation that is consistent with the reported regional inhibition of er <dig> expression in pax6-defficient mutants. the expression of er <dig> in cortical germinative neuroepithelium in other regions and in mature neurons may involve regulation by other molecular determinants acting independently of, or together with, pax <dig>
