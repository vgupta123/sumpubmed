BACKGROUND
the commercially and ecologically important seaweed saccharina japonica  c.e. lane, c. mayes, druehl & g.w. saunders is widely distributed along the coast of japan sea. taxonomically, this species was initially named laminaria japonica by areschoug in  <dig>  <cit> . recently, lane et al.  <cit>  reported a new genus saccharina stackhouse from the genus laminaria lamouroux based on multiple lines of molecular data and proposed to use s. japonica to replace l. japonica. the systematic survey in laminariales from the far eastern seas of russia also supported to transfer l. japonica into the genus saccharina  <cit> . for s. japonica along the coast of hokkaido, integrative morphological and phylogenetic analyses have identified four varieties, s. religiosa  c.e. lane, c. mayes, druehl & g.w. saunders, s. ochotensis  c.e. lane, c. mayes, druehl & g.w. saunders and s. diabolica  c.e. lane, c. mayes, druehl & g.w. saunders  <cit> . in this study, we did not distinguish these varieties and treated them as one species for phylogeographic analyses.

global climate change and over exploitation has drastically reduced the resource of s. japonica in recent years  <cit> . understanding genetic diversity and population structure of wild s. japonica populations will aid in the management, conservation and breeding of this marine macroalga. however, current genetic researches of s. japonica mainly focused on cultivated populations, and involved wild populations only on a limited geographic scale  <cit> . the broad picture of wild s. japonica populations in the japan sea needs clarification, especially regarding population genetic and phylogeographic patterns on a large geographic scale.

population structure and genetic diversity of marine organisms in the northwestern pacific ocean exhibited complex patterns which mainly resulted from biotic factors  and abiotic factors  . the semi-isolated marginal japan sea is connected with the sea of okhostk, the north pacific, and the east china sea through four shallow straits of less than 130 m depth  <cit>  . during the last glacial maximum , shallow straits restricted or completely blocked inflow of the warm tsushima current into the japan sea via the tsushima and tsugaru straits, reducing sea water temperatures and salinity. after the lgm, higher sea level allowed relatively warm water to flow into the japan sea and increased seawater temperature and salinity. since the mid-holocene, the modern oceanographic regime of the japan sea was established  and paleoclimatic oscillations and intricate tectonic topography may have affected the genetic diversity and genetic structure of macroalgae in the northwestern pacific  <cit> . in addition, dispersal processes played an important role in facilitating gene flow in macroalgal populations and structuring the established populations . along with short-lived spores and gametes, macroalgae have relatively poor dispersal ability  <cit> . however, ocean currents facilitated dispersal over long distances for organisms such as laminaria digitata  j.v. lamouroux and macrocystis pyrifera  c. agardh  <cit> . incident anthropogenic introduction of s. japonica influenced dispersal and gene flow of brown seaweed, especially economic seaweeds  <cit> . in the wild environment, which kinds of factors affected the genetic structure and phylogeographic pattern of s. japonica are rarely known.fig.  <dig> map showing the sampling locations, and schematic oceanic currents around the japan sea. pink arrows indicate warm currents and blue ones cold currents  <cit> 



mitochondrial coi and trn dna markers have been intensively used to explore intra-specific phylogeographic patterns of brown seaweeds , including the kelp s. japonica  <cit> . in particular, coi marker has been demonstrated to has more polymorphism sites than nuclear  and plastid , and has been verified in s. japonica  <cit> . in the present study, we chose mitochondrial coi and trnw-l and applied them in 26 s. japonica wild populations to explore intraspecific genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history and to find potential abiotic and/or biotic factors associated with genetic differentiation in s. japonica.

methods
sample collection
between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> populations of s. japonica  were collected, ranging from sakhalin, russia  to shandong, china  . the collection covered most kelp distribution locations along the coast of the northwestern pacific ocean.fig.  <dig> distribution of the  <dig> combined mtdna haplotypes detected in the  <dig> saccharina japonica populations. pie charts are labeled with the population numbers as shown in table  <dig>  the size of divisions inside each pie chart is proportional to the frequency of occurrence for individual haplotypes. colors represent the shared haplotypes and private haplotypes are shown in white



dna extraction, pcr and sequencing
s. japonica genomic dna was extracted using the plant genomic dna kit  according to manufacturer’s instructions and mitochondrial markers coi and trnw-l were adopted. one coi partial region was amplified with primers saccoif and saccoir  <cit>  and the trnw-l partial region from the 3′ end of the trnw gene to the 5′end of the trnl was amplified with primers 5′-ggttcaagtccctctctttctgt-3′  and 5′-aacctaaacccagcgtgtat-3′  based on the mitochondrial genome sequence of s. japonica  <cit> . the pcr mixture  containing 50 ng genomic dna,  <dig>  mm dntp, 1 × taq buffer,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig>  unit taq polymerase and sterile water  was amplified on a takara thermocycler  with initial denaturation of 95 °c for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °c denaturation for 30 s, 52 °c /55 °c  annealing for 30 s, a 72 °c extension for 2 min  or 1 min  and final extension of 72 °c for 5 min. amplified products were sequenced on an abi prisim  <dig> automatic sequencer  and sequenced data were edited and aligned with bioedit v <dig>  software  <cit> .

data analysis
genetic diversity and haplotype network construction
the number of segregating sites , average number of nucleotide differences , nucleotide diversity  and haplotype diversity  were calculated using dnasp v <dig>  <cit> . network v <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  was used to generate the maximum parsimony media-joining network, which exhibited genealogical relation to the haplotypes of s. japonica. to test mutation rate, coi and trnw-l sequence data were concatenated and the combined mtdna haplotype network was constructed.

population structure and gene flow
with concatenated data of two mtdna loci, bayesian analysis of population structure was conducted using baps v <dig>  with a spatial model to define groups  <cit> . calculations were performed with the upper number of k clusters varying from  <dig> to  <dig>  providing the highest posterior probability for reasonable partitioning. hierarchical molecular variance analysis  was performed on the four baps groups with  <dig>  permutations using arlequin v <dig>   <cit> . estimated fst values of pairwise populations and pairwise baps groups were conducted for genetic differentiation analysis using  <dig>  permutations with arlequin v <dig> .

the mantel test for isolation-by-distance  established relationships between genetic and geographic distances  <cit>  and genetic distances ) were regressed against the logarithm of geographic distances within location distances . to visualize ibd patterns  <cit> ,  <dig> randomizations were analyzed with ibdws .

to further test migration rate and divergence time between neighboring populations in far eastern russia and hokkaido, an isolation-with-migration model was applied using software ima <dig>  <cit> . migration rate for population pairs in ima <dig> had to be estimated due to computational challenges related to the high number of parameters from multiple populations. preliminary runs were performed to optimize upper bounds on prior distributions  and to optimize heating schemes. final analyses consisted of three runs of 10– <dig> geometrically heated chains with burn-in of  <dig>  steps. the heating scheme used a geometric model with parameters ha =  <dig>  and hb =  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  genealogies were saved after the three long runs and used to calculate parameter values and likelihood ratio tests of nested speciation models  <cit> .

molecular clock calibration
according to the study of silberfeld et al.  <cit>  on brown algae, the divergence time of saccharina occurred approximately 20 ma ago. therefore, 626 bp coi was used to re-construct the phylogeny of laminariales  and 20 ma was used as the ancestral time of the common ancestor  of saccharina, pelagophycus areschoug and nereocystis postels & ruprecht, which all are implemented in beast v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with the uncorrelated log-normal  relaxed-clock model and the hky model based on the bayesian information criterion analysis in partitionfinder v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the maximum clade credibility tree was constructed with treeannotator v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

demographic history
the duration of transplantation and domestication to s. japonica in china and korea is short compared with terrestrial crops, so neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis were used to explore the demographic history of the 22 s. japonica populations  was applied for the historical demographic analysis of s. japonica using beast v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . coi or trnw-l marker and concatenated data  was used for data analysis, with mean substitution/site selected at  <dig>  for the time estimation to the units of substitution/site. the hky + i substitution model was selected for coi, the hky substitution model was applied for trnw-l and the hky + g substitution model was selected for combined sequences as identified in partitionfinder v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the number of grouped intervals was set at  <dig>  and each run was initiated with random starting trees having chain lengths of 3 ×  <dig> and  <dig>  for each marker, multiple analyses were conducted with different random seeds to test convergence, and results from replicate runs were pooled with logcombiner v <dig> . <dig> and parameters were assessed using tracer v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
haplotype patterns and network
with alignment and trimming, the remaining sequences were 1528 bp for coi and 362 bp for trnw-l. in the coi and trnw-l sequences from  <dig> individuals,  <dig> and  <dig> segregating sites respectively were identified, possessing  <dig> coi haplotypes  and  <dig> trnw-l haplotypes .

calculated genetic variations are summarized in table  <dig>  for the coi marker, nucleotide diversity  range was  <dig> – <dig>  and haplotype diversity  range was  <dig> – <dig> . for the trnw-l marker, haplotype diversity was  <dig> – <dig>  and nucleotide diversity was  <dig> – <dig> . data from both coi and trnw-l showed highest diversity indices in hokkaido, japan. for the whole dataset , there were  <dig> segregating sites and  <dig> haplotypes in all the  <dig> populations . haplotype diversity  of total populations was  <dig> , with a range of  <dig> – <dig>  , and haplotype diversity in hokkaido  was higher than in other populations  . highest nucleotide diversity was also detected in hokkaido populations  . generally, diversity parameters yielded from the two combined mtdna markers indicated that pop <dig> and pop <dig> possessed the highest nucleotide and haplotype diversity and pop <dig>  and pop <dig>  exhibited the lowest nucleotide and haplotype diversity . all genetic diversity parameters indicated that the s. japonica populations along the coast of hokkaido exhibited the highest genetic diversity.table  <dig> the summary of genetic diversity in saccharina japonica

demographic history
the significantly negative tajima’s d and fu fs values indicated that s. japonica populations might experience demographic expansion . using a single coi marker or trn w-l marker for mismatch distribution, displayed l-shaped and reflected shallow haplotype phylogeny in s. japonica populations . moreover, the mismatch distribution of combined haplotypes showed a unimodal pattern, indicating that s. japonica populations might have expanded. in addition, bayesian skyline plots analyses showed that s. japonica population underwent population expansion .

with a maximum clade credibility tree based on the coi data , divergent time between the s. japonica and s. augustata  c.e. lane, c. mayes, druehl & g.w. saunders was assumed to be  <dig>  ma. calculated coi region divergence between s. japonica  and s. augustata  was  <dig>  % and estimated divergent rate was  <dig>  %/ma   <cit> . since mutation rate should be half of divergence rate  <cit> , estimated mutation rate was  <dig>  %/ma. bayesian skyline plots and the calculated molecular clock of coi suggested that s. japonica populations started to expand at  <dig>  ka .

discussion
two shallow genealogies existed in s. japonica populations
data sets revealed a shallow genetic structure in s. japonica, with many shared haplotypes in four genetic clusters . the combined network does not have large divergences between haplotype groups and two shallow genealogies corresponded to two baps groups  . most kelp populations in these two genealogies were isolated by the soya strait, a major outlet of the tsushima warm current  <cit> . the current flow direction has hindered dispersal of kelp, producing low levels of gene flow  in both directions between these two genealogies . the tsushima warm current flows through the soya strait and enhanced the sea water temperature and salinity  <cit> , so the northern coast of hokkaido has higher sea temperature and lower salinity than the west coast of sakhalin, which might lead to different release time of spores, different discharge time of sperm and different egg fertilization time  <cit> . distinct marine environmental factors and non-simultaneous reproductive duration likely caused these two genealogies isolation and influenced the formation of them.

postglacial expansion, oceanic current and anthropogenic introduction influence the current genetic structure
mismatch distributions, neutrality tests and bsp analyses all suggested that s. japonica expanded in the northwestern pacific ocean and calculations using the coi molecular clock suggested that such population expansion occurred about  <dig>  ka. post-lgm expansion  significantly influenced the demography of seaweeds  <cit> . the paleoceanographic record in the japan sea shows that sea water temperature and salinity were lower  during the lgm  and seawater exchange through straits was blocked. after the lgm, sea water temperature rose in the early holocene  due to the inflow of tsushima warm current and sea temperature rose 6–7 °c. meanwhile, the salinity of seawater in the japan sea increased during the interglacial period. with the cold-adapted and lower salinity tolerant characters, s. japonica could survive severe ancient conditions and colonized suitable coastal territories when the sea level increased after the lgm. judging from the constructed haplotype network  and ima analyses , pink and green genealogies had no contemporary gene flow since they diverged in mid-pleistocene, showing that these two genealogies might be existed at least in two glacial refugia in the japan sea coast during lgm and afterwards, expanded their populations to the current distribution in the interglacial period.

low genetic differentiation in the populations of s. japonica suggested gene exchange among detected populations. in addition, there were several shared haplotypes and no significant population differentiation corresponding to geographic distribution , indicating gene flow in kelp populations. shared haplotype h <dig> and h <dig> indicated that some populations in sakhalin and hokkaido had gene exchange. lower gene flow existed in brown algae such as fucus ceranoides linnaeus and laminaria digitata  lamouroux  <cit>  due to factors such as short-lived spores and gametes and reproductive strategies  <cit> . macroalgae are species with relatively poor dispersal ability, but s. japonica in the present study has high gene flow among most populations. in s. japonica, due to limited gametes and spores dispersal ability, the floating or drifting thallus by oceanic currents was regarded as the main dispersal factor to enhance the gene flow in the kelp populations  <cit> . the warm tsushima current, flows northward along the western coast of hokkaido, and enters into sea of okhostk through the soya strait, then forwards along coast of northern hokkaido. the tsushima current is likely the major force responsible for drifting kelp thallus from the eastern coast of hokkaido to kunashir island, evidenced by asymmetric gene flow between wa and sh .

marine transportation also promotes kelp population genetic homogeneity. pop  <dig>  and pop 15– <dig> in sakhalin shared also one haplotype , and pop <dig>  and pop <dig>  shared one haplotype , indicating gene exchange in far eastern russia populations. in addition, ima analyses indicated that an asymmetric gene flow existed between ws and vl in far eastern russia . marine transportation seems closely related to kelp introduction from west coast of sakhalin to primorye costal region, because most locations are near harbors. besides ballast water in ships likely promoted gene exchange in macroalgae such as undaria pinnatifida  suringar  <cit> .

artificial cultivation enhances kelp distribution and impacts population genetic patterns  <cit> . gene flow reduces population differences and promotes shallow population genetic structure. shared haplotypes h <dig> in china and h <dig> in japan indicated that s. japonica in china was mainly from hokkaido areas, confirming suggestions of tseng et al.,  <cit> . pop <dig> in korea shared haplotypes h <dig> and h <dig> with pop <dig> and pop <dig> in hokkaido. apparently, artificial cultivation facilitates the gene exchange among the populations in china, south korea and japan.

genetic diversity pattern
ancestral laminariales occurred along the coast of hokkaido, which is regarded as the diversity center for kelps in the northwestern pacific ocean  <cit> . similar to undaria pinnatifida and gracilaria vermiculophylla  papenfuss  <cit> , s. japonica exhibited the highest genetic diversity in hokkaido. among the  <dig> haplotypes analyzed with the coi and trnw-l marker systems, h <dig> was the most common in almost all populations , so h <dig> might be the ancestral haplotype. moreover, pop <dig> and pop <dig> presented the highest genetic diversity among all populations , suggesting that the origin and diversification center may be on the southwest coast of hokkaido.

the invasive populations have lower genetic diversity than the source populations as reported in other introduced seaweeds, including gracilaria vermiculophylla  papenfuss  <cit> , codium fragile  hariot  <cit>  and caulerpa taxifolia  c. agardh  <cit> . s. japonica is not native to china and this kelp was firstly found in the vicinity of dalian harbor around 1930s  <cit> , possibly because it was accidentally introduced by rafts or ships from japan to china. it is interesting that natural populations in china have relatively high genetic diversity based on the nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity . we presumed that human mediated multiple introductions for breeding and cultivation contributed to high genetic diversity in china populations. recently, selection, breeding and cultivation have reduced the genetic diversity and narrowed the genetic base to the cultivated kelp populations in china  <cit> . in this study, the identified wild kelp populations with high genetic diversity might make important contributions to improve and enhance domesticated genepool of cultivated s. japonica in china.

CONCLUSIONS
this study examined the phylogeographic architecture and population genetic diversity of s. japonica in its native range. the shallow phylogeographic architecture suggests a complex interaction of anthropogenic interference  and post-lgm population expansion. the coast of hokkaido might be the origin center for s. japonica in the northwestern pacific. extensive selection and multi-generation inbreeding have already reduced genetic diversity of s. japonica and caused genetic degeneration of cultivars in china. the generated knowledge about the levels of diversity of wild s. japonica populations is an important contribution for efficient breeding and rejuvenation of cultivated saccharina by improving and enhancing domesticated genepool of s. japonica in china.
