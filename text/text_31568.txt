BACKGROUND
muscular dystrophies  are inherited, sometimes fatal diseases associated with progressive muscle wasting and brain defects  <cit> . in addition to these well-known symptoms, reports have also shown that mds can cause problematic metabolism, oxidative and energetic stress, and overproliferation of muscle satellite cells  <cit> . mds can be genetically linked to mutations in the dystrophin glycoprotein complex  which in mammals generally consists of the very large dystrophin protein, dystroglycans α and β, sarcoglycans α, β, γ and δ, sarcospan and numerous other proteins including syntrophins α <dig>  β <dig>  γ <dig> and γ <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to providing structural support to muscles, the dgc has also been shown to be involved in general signaling pathways. for example, dystroglycan binding to laminin and dystrophin binding to syntrophins is necessary for g-protein activation of pi3k/akt and syntrophin-grb2-sos1-rac1-pak1-jnk signaling  <cit> . dystrophin has also recently been linked to microrna  regulation where dystrophin deficiency in mice and humans causes altered mirna profiles . in particular, the dgc via dystrophin-syntrophin-neuronal nitric oxide synthase signaling can regulate the expression of mirnas via histone modification  <cit> . accordingly, patients with the severe duchenne md resulting from the loss of dystrophin have altered gene transcript levels in muscles correlating with misexpressed mirnas  <cit> , and the dystrophin deficient nervous system has distorted gene expression in mice  <cit> . due to general signaling and the control over expression of mirnas and downstream gene transcripts, it is now believed that there are numerous cellular processes that are impacted by mutations in dgc components.

the dgc is conserved and most of the involved proteins have homologues in drosophila <cit>  that have been shown to be expressed in muscles and the nervous system  <cit> . we specifically study dystrophin  and dystroglycan  mutants which we have used to study the role of these proteins in muscle and the nervous system. as in mammals, loss of dys and dg results in age related muscle wasting, and several proteins genetically interact with dys and/or dg causing muscle degeneration  <cit> . most importantly, stress can cause muscle degeneration even in wild type animals and can accelerate it in dystrophic mutants. additionally, dg is involved in maintaining muscle cell homeostasis under energetic stress  <cit> . in the drosophila nervous system, dys and dg have a role in the developing visual system and can impact the ability of axons to migrate properly  <cit> . due to these findings, we hypothesize that some shared processes are perturbed under stress and dystrophic conditions which can explain why dystrophic phenotypes can be recovered simply by inducing stress.

our aim here is to improve our understanding of how stress and dystrophy are related to one another. mirnas have been implicated in stress response before  <cit>  and, as previously noted, mutations in dys can cause mirna misregulation  <cit> . therefore, we conducted a mirna microarray screen in dys and dg loss of function mutants and in stressed wild type  and mutant animals. here we used whole animals to screen for misregulated mirnas to find altered levels in tissues other than muscle, including the nervous system. we found that similarities are shared in mirna profiles under stress and dystrophic conditions, that loss of dg and/or dys can alter mirna levels and that signaling via syntrophin-like  <dig>  controls the expression levels of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  the regulation of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> is not restricted to the musculature, but occurs also in the nervous system. even though it is not common for mirnas to be evolutionarily conserved, the processes that they regulate are. thus, our results help gain a better understanding of how organismal homeostasis is regulated by the dgc and associated mirnas.

RESULTS
stress and dystrophy alter the mirna profile in drosophila
we used 3– <dig> day old adult male flies to profile the levels of mirnas via microarray in wt , dys  and dg  mutants both under normal and stress conditions. high temperature is a good stressor to recover dystrophic symptoms in wild type animals, and accelerates muscle degeneration and alters metabolic function in mutants  <cit> . therefore, to stress animals for this study, they were kept for  <dig> days at 33°c. young animals were used because they do not have muscle wasting yet, and we did not want to detect altered mirna levels due to degenerative processes, but rather altered cellular processes. based on mirnas annotated in mirbase release  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> pre-mirnas and  <dig> anti-sense mirnas were tested. of these,  <dig> mature mirnas were found to give a signal above the background threshold in at least one of the genotypes/conditions tested . nine comparisons were possible based on having three genotypes in two conditions each. the results could then be categorized by mirnas that were altered dependent upon genotype only, those altered dependent upon stress and genotype, and those that were altered dependent upon stress only. based on this large set of data allowing for many comparisons, we divided the data into functional sub-categories. though of possible future interest, pre- and anti-sense mirnas were not considered further.

mirna expression profiles link stress, dystrophy and dgc signaling
to assess the microarray derived mirna levels in this study, we make several assumptions allowing us to categorize misregulated mirnas based on presumed biological roles. first, we contend that there are common biological problems that are shared in dystrophic and stress conditions that can explain why we can recover dystrophic phenotypes by inducing stress. accordingly, the downregulation of a mirna in a mutant at an ambient, non-stressful temperature could also be downregulated in the wt animal at a stressful temperature. therefore, the comparison of a stressed mutant and a stressed wt animal may show no difference in a mirna level due to a shared biological problem. furthermore, if a mutation causes a mirna to be misregulated at the ambient temperature then that same mirna should be misregulated similarly in the mutant at 33°c relative to wt at the ambient temperature. based on this logic, we assigned mirnas into functional categories.

the first category consists of mirnas that are altered based on stress and dystrophy . these mirnas are downregulated due to mutations in both dys and dg at both temperatures relative to wt animals kept at 25°c. also, stressed wt animals have the same mirnas downregulated. dystrophic mirnas revealed are mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-iab-4-5p and mir- <dig> 

the next category is dgc differential stress response mirnas. when we use hyperthermia to induce stress we can see that there is a mirna response . some mirna levels decrease, and a subset of mirnas that are usually not expressed at 25°c are ‘turned on’. these could be protective mirnas that are expressed to regulate the negative effects of stress. stressed mutants also respond, but since dystrophic muscles are already compromised  mirna levels do not change in the same way as in wt animals. there can be two sub-categories delineated; mirnas that do not change normally under stress, but do in dystrophic mutants  and mirnas that change as a normal response, but do not in dys and dg mutants .

since there are similarities in stress and dystrophy mirna regulation, and shared phenotypes in mutant dystrophic and stressed animals  <cit> , we are also interested in how the dystrophic genotypes can modify mirna levels. to this extent, we can see that loss of dg and dys leads to altered mirna profiles . to fit into one of these clusters the mirna must be downregulated due to the mutation  at both 25°c and 33°c relative to the wt control at the ambient temperature. in addition, to eliminate hyperthermia response mirnas, levels should not change in the mutant at different temperatures. these criteria return mirnas that are misregulated due to mutations alone based on the assumptions outlined above. we found that potential dg-regulated mirnas are mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  potential dys-regulated mirnas are mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-iab-4-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  worth noting, is that of all of the  <dig> mature mirnas found by the microarray to be expressed in the adult male, there is great redundancy in those misregulated between the four functional groups. in total 65% of the isolated microarray identified mirnas are common to more than one of the defined functional groups . this implies that stress, dystrophy and dys/dg signaling are interconnected in the biology of the entire organism . next, we verified data derived from the microarray screen.

verification of microarray data points to mirna regulation by stress
we tested levels of  <dig> mirnas in wt and mutant animals  in both stress and non-stress conditions using taqman microrna quantitative pcr  assays resulting in  <dig> comparisons. we were particularly interested in dys signaling mirna regulation, thus we tested the “dys dependent” cluster from figure 2d: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-iab-4-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> .

based on the verification we were explicitly able to assign functionality to the subset of tested mirnas. first mir- <dig> and mir-iab-4-5p are downregulated in wt animals in response to hyperthermic stress, but their levels are not altered appropriately in dys and dg mutants. thus, they are classified as dys/dg dependent stress response mirnas . we also found that mir- <dig> is a general high temperature stress response mirna . the level of mir- <dig> is decreased at 33°c in all three genotypes, and is not affected by the mutations. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> levels are decreased due to the absence of dg at ambient temperature and these mirnas are downregulated at the higher temperature in both wt and dg mutants . however, at 33°c both of these mirna’s levels remain at the ambient temperature levels in dys mutants. interestingly, appropriate levels of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> depend on both dg and dys .

of the  <dig> comparisons made using q-pcr,  <dig>  agreed with the microarray data. recently a rt q-pcr based array has become available that uses the same stem-loop rt technology as the taqman assays used in our verification studies  <cit> . subsequently, a study was undertaken that specifically compared the q-pcr array technology to the standard microarray technology used here  <cit> . surprisingly, this group reported that the two methods only had a correlation of − <dig>  and most interestingly, the microarray found 13% of mirnas to be differentially expressed compared to only 1% of tested mirnas by the q-pcr array. the finding of that study supports our work here in regards to the low percentage of agreement between the microarray data and that verified via q-pcr and emphasizes the importance of proper verification in these types of studies in general.

verification of microarray data points to mirna regulation by the dg-dys-syn <dig> pathway
it has been reported before that mirnas can be regulated via dys-syn-nnos signaling in mammals  <cit> , thus we wanted to know if the three mirnas that are downregulated in dg and dys mutants are also affected by reduction of syntrophin. there are two syntrophin genes in drosophila, syntrophin-like  <dig>  is homologous to α1/β1/β2-syntrophins and syntrophin-like  <dig>  is homologous to γ1/γ2-syntrophins. we chose to examine the effect of syn <dig> reduction via rnai  on the levels of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  since in mammals it was found that α1/β1/β2-syntrophins bind to nnos  <cit> . to downregulate syn <dig>  we used a syn <dig> rnai construct driven by a ubiquitous gal <dig> driver  which resulted in a ~65% reduction of syn <dig> expression . we also found that in addition to the loss of dys and dg, reduction of syn <dig> caused a decrease in all three mirna’s levels . these data suggest that there is a similar regulatory pathway in drosophila for the management of mirna levels by the dg-dys-syn <dig> pathway.

importantly, dg, dys, and syn <dig> expression levels could be mutually dependent; the loss of one of these proteins could affect the levels of the others. to determine if this is the case we measured the levels of dys mrna in dg and dssyn <dig> mutants, dg mrna levels in dys and dssyn <dig> mutants, and syn <dig> mrna levels in both dys and dg mutants. we found that the loss of dys did not affect the levels of dg mrna, but the loss of dg does lower the amount of dys mrna . additionally, loss of dys or dg causes a reduction in syn <dig> mrna levels. dg levels are slightly decreased  in dssyn <dig> mutants, but dys levels are not altered. overall our results reveal the existence of dg-dys-syn <dig> signaling, which involves mirnas and regulates biological processes in dystrophic conditions .

putative mrna targets of dg-dys-syn <dig> regulated mirnas are involved in general cellular processes, the nervous system, and muscle development and maintenance
mirnas provide a strategy for gene regulation mainly by interacting with the 3′untranslated regions  of target transcripts  <cit> . to determine what biological significance the regulation of the three identified dgc mirnas could have, we determined their putative targets and their possible biological roles based on these targets. we first derived lists of potential conserved  genetic targets using the targetscan database  <cit>  and compared them to predicted targets from microrna.org  <cit>  for consensus. the individual lists of target genes per mirna were then analyzed using the generic gene ontology  term finder tool  <cit> .

mir- <dig> is the most highly expressed mirna in the adult fly, and it has  <dig> putative targets that are involved in a large range of biological processes which agree among the two databases. the most notable categories of mir- <dig> predicted targets are imaginal disc morphogenesis and regulation of cellular processes . due to the large number of targets and go terms, it is difficult to assign one specific function for mir- <dig> 

after careful analysis, mir- <dig> showed  <dig> putative target genes  and the majority of them are involved in axon guidance . interestingly, dg is a putative target identified by both databases involved in most of the axon guidance processes, but it is not a conserved target among drosophila species. due to this, dg was not included in the go analysis.

we additionally found mir- <dig> to have  <dig> putative target genes , and the majority of these are involved in muscle development . because mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are predicted to be involved in varied processes and are regulated via the dg-dys-syn <dig> pathway, we hypothesize that this signaling plays a role in general cellular processes of the nervous system and muscle via mirna regulation. ongoing efforts should shed light on this proposal in the future.

dg-dys-syn <dig> regulated mirnas are expressed in the nervous system and musculature
to determine when and where the dg-dys-syn <dig> regulated mirnas are expressed, we performed reverse transcription quantitative pcr  for these mirnas from rnas extracted at different developmental time points and from individual adult body parts. all levels were normalized to those of the whole adult male fly. we additionally analyzed larval brains and muscles using locked nucleic acid  in situ hybridization with probes targeting mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> 

mir- <dig> is expressed at a very low level in the adult head and is primarily detected in the adult thorax and abdomen . a reasonable hypothesis based on these data and the go of predicted target genes is that mir- <dig> is expressed in the adult animal in the muscles of the thorax and abdomen to repress muscle development genes. the relatively low level of mir- <dig> during embryonic, larval and pupal stages when muscles actively develop and grow supports this hypothesis. in situ hybridization revealed a strong ubiquitous signal in the larval brain and muscles . though expression in the muscle tissue was expected, expression in the brain was not. it will be of future interest to explore this finding which will be dependent upon the generation of an appropriate mir- <dig> mutant.

mir- <dig> has mostly nervous system predicted targets and is expressed during embryogenesis and the larval stage, but a decrease in levels is seen in pupae . this could be indicative of a role in repressing target genes that are critical for sequences of temporal processes such as nervous system remodeling. once metamorphosis is complete, mir- <dig> levels are elevated again, and the highest relative level is noted in the head. analysis of mir- <dig> expression shows that it is expressed in the developing eye, the axons of photoreceptor neurons and in the midbrain . the flybase annotated allele pcg3777np <dig> disrupts mir- <dig>  but does not disturb the mature sequence. the result is a hypomorphic homozygous viable mutant that reduces mir- <dig> levels by ~70% analyzed via rt q-pcr at the ambient temperature . in accord with the reduced mir- <dig> levels, mir- <dig> mutants have a reduced, but not abolished lna hybridization signal  which supports the specificity of mir- <dig> expression detected by the lna probe. interestingly, no expression was detected in larval body wall muscles . mir- <dig> expression in the adult body could be from the peripheral nervous system including the thoracic ganglion, a large structure located in the thorax.

mir- <dig> levels gradually increase throughout development, and the expression is highest in the adult . since mir- <dig> is predicted to downregulate genes involved in morphogenesis perhaps its levels are decreased to allow for progression of such processes during developmental stages. of the individual body parts, mir- <dig> is seen to be elevated threefold in the head relative to the whole body. an expression pattern similar to the expression of mir- <dig> is seen for mir- <dig> . expression is evident in the eye disc and optic lobe. additionally, a signal is seen in the midbrain and the ventral ganglion . the flybase annotated allele pbacll <dig> disrupts the mature sequence of mir- <dig> resulting in a homozygous viable null mutant analyzed via rt q-pcr . in agreement with this being a loss of function mutant, mir- <dig> mutants do not show any apparent expression pattern. even though our data show that mir- <dig> levels are changed due to muscular dystrophy, expression was not detected in larval body wall muscles. the expression profiling and detection of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> supports our hypothesis that dg-dys-syn <dig> signaling is part of an organism’s overall development and homeostasis.

mir- <dig> can regulate levels of dgc interacting components
previously large scale screening found dys and/or dg genetic interactors using an easily detectable wing vein phenotype  <cit>  and identified numerous potential genes. further screening was then conducted to determine which of those interactors also affected muscle degeneration  <cit> . we have found in this study three mirnas that are regulated by both dys and dg. therefore, we examined 3′utr sequences of the previously identified genetic interactors to see if any of them are possible targets of these mirnas. we found that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and to a greater extent, mir- <dig> can potentially target a portion of them . of the  <dig> genes that were found in the primary screen to interact with dys and/or dg,  <dig> of them  can potentially be targeted by the mirnas identified to be involved in the dg-dys-syn <dig> pathway here. interestingly, mir- <dig> can potentially target dg while dg, dys and syn <dig> are putative mir- <dig> targets. in addition to these main dgc components, mir- <dig> can potentially target robo  and vimar , which were found to interact with dys and/or dg in the muscle degeneration process. calmodulin  is also a non-conserved possible target of mir- <dig> that was found to not only interact with dys in wing vein formation and muscle degeneration, but to genetically cooperate with both dys and dg in axon path finding and photoreceptor differentiation  <cit> .

mature mirnas are incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex , where this complex targets mrnas by annealing to the 3′utr and promoting either mrna degradation or translational inhibition  <cit> . since it has been found that the most robust mrna targets of mirnas can be detected by variation in mrna levels  <cit> , we tested the putative dgc component and conserved muscle targets via rt q-pcr in mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mutants. if the mrnas tested are direct targets of the mirnas, then we would expect to see an increase in the mrna levels in the mutants. dg mrna levels were not altered in hypomorphic mir- <dig> mutants , but mir- <dig> levels are not completely abolished. interestingly, the tested dgc components and interactors predicted to be mir- <dig> targets cannot be directly downregulated by this mirna ; however, loss of mir- <dig> negatively affects mrna levels of dg, robo and vimar. these results suggest that mir- <dig> is involved in the regulatory circuitry maintaining dgc associated protein levels.

robo has been studied extensively in the past and is part of the slit-robo pathway involved in axon guidance and brain compartmentalization  <cit> . however, vimar has been less studied: the founding report presented evidence that it is expressed in the embryonic midgut and hindgut visceral mesoderm, as well as in the cns and pns  <cit> . another screen found vimar to be required for proper mitochondrial function  <cit> . the regulation of these diverse proteins suggests that the overall cellular processes that are controlled by the dg-dys-syn1-mir- <dig> pathway are diverse and related to the dystrophic symptoms found in our previous works.

mir- <dig> regulates stress response in drosophila
as can be seen in figure 3d, mir- <dig> levels were also decreased due to hyperthermic stress. therefore, we next wanted to determine if mir- <dig> is involved in stress biology. we first assayed muscle degeneration of mir- <dig> hypomorphic mutants and control animals housed at both 25°c and 33°c. as would be expected based on our prior report  <cit> , the control animals had muscle degeneration caused by the high temperature stress after eighteen days relative to those kept at 25°c . interestingly, the reduction of mir- <dig> preserved the muscles after the same time period at 33°c relative to 25°c .

in a further effort to see how mir- <dig> mutants respond to stress, we utilized a hyperthermic mobility assay  <cit> . animals are placed in a vial that is pre-heated to ~38°c and are scored every  <dig> s for mobility. animals that have muscle and/or neuromuscular problems may start to seize and/or become paralyzed. we did not observe mir- <dig> mutants to have mobility defects in this assay . however, animals that were housed in 33°c did lose the ability to move at approximately fourteen days while the wt flies still performed normally. the timing of this inability to move coincided with the onset when mir- <dig> mutants started to die .

interestingly, the lifespan of mir- <dig> mutants at 25°c was similar to control and only at 33°c did they start dying significantly earlier than wt animals  . based on these results we hypothesize that the reduction of mir- <dig> under high temperature stress makes flies immobile, which is to some extent a protective mechanism that can at least preserve muscle tissue for a period of time. however, based on the lifespan studies, it appears that other adverse effects can be a result of this yet undefined mechanism. this is particularly interesting since we did not detect mir- <dig> expression in muscle, but in the nervous system . these data suggest the mir- <dig> has a specific function in the nervous system that influences muscle functioning and subsequently longevity under hyperthermic stress.

mir- <dig> is required for proper muscle development
we took advantage of the null mir- <dig> mutant to examine its possible functionality. we initially noted that young three to four day old animals already had degenerated muscles relative to the wt animals . we additionally aged and applied hyperthermic stress to control and mir- <dig> mutant animals and again assayed muscle degeneration. though mir- <dig> mutants continued to have more muscle degeneration than wt animals, the relative amount of muscle degeneration was not amplified as a result of aging or stress .

contrary to mir- <dig> mutants, mir- <dig> mutants had significant difficulties remaining mobile at the high temperature . as we only were able to confirm expression of mir- <dig> in the nervous system , this phenotype could be indicative of improper neuron-muscle communication. additional lifespan testing did not reveal that loss of mir- <dig> caused accelerated mortality . future experiments are aimed at a more in depth analysis of the role of mir- <dig> and its relationship with the dgc.

discussion
under stressful conditions an organism can respond by adjusting metabolism, an important survival mechanism to address new cellular needs dependent upon the condition. when stress is applied, it is not logical for a cell to undergo a large transcriptional reorganization and generate new cellular proteins. it would be much easier to have a quicker response in place that can be mediated via mirnas. indeed it has been reported that metabolic rate reduction is linked to mirna expression  <cit> .

we have reported in the past that dg mutants do not metabolically respond correctly to a low energy diet, where their metabolism remains high compared to wt animals  <cit> . we have additionally seen that dys and dg mutants, respectively, have elevated and decreased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species in animals housed at 29°c  <cit> . we have further observed temperature-related trends relative to co <dig> output and atp levels . additionally, dg has been implicated to be involved in starvation response by interacting with the mitochondrial ribosomal protein mrpl <dig> to regulate epithelial cell polarity  <cit> . the totality of these data suggests that the dgc and, particularly, dg is involved in cellular homeostasis and stress response in general.

here we were able to determine that in the absence of dys or dg the levels of mir- <dig> and mir-iab-4-5p fail to undergo the appropriate downregulation seen in wt animals in response to high temperature stress. it will be interesting in the future to determine if this lack of proper response contributes to the rapid progression of muscle degeneration that occurs when mutants are stressed. mir- <dig> has been shown to be specific to the nervous system and can be regulated by fragile x mental retardation protein  <dig>   <cit> . mir-iab-4-5p inhibits the homeodomain protein ultrabithorax, and when ectopically expressed causes a homeotic transformation of halters into wings  <cit> . additionally, we have revealed in our screen that mir- <dig> is a general stress response mirna that is significantly downregulated in the hyperthermic condition regardless of the genomic background. due to the dgc being implicated in a general stress response, not just hyperthermia, it will be of great interest to determine if these are general stress response mirnas as well.

prior studies on how muscle diseases affect the mirna profile have been limited to muscles from mammalian disease models or biopsies from patients. such studies have revealed in these tissues that misregulated mirnas are involved in multiple biochemical pathways  <cit> . in agreement, transcriptomic analysis shows dysregulated genes associated with not only muscle cell contraction, but ion channels, metabolic pathways, and kinases in dystrophin deficient myotubes  <cit> . a more detailed analysis in muscle revealed a signaling pathway involving dys-syn-nnos regulated histone modification allowing for proper transcription of mirna genes  <cit> . we have expanded on these previous works here and found that loss of dg, similarly to dys loss, alters the mirna profile. furthermore, a signaling pathway involving dg-dys-syn <dig> exists and can also regulate at least three mirnas.

dg-dys-syn <dig> regulates expression of mirnas with different potential targets implemented in multiple developmental processes. accordingly, the dgc is present in multiple tissues postulating that this complex has a more subtle housekeeping function. the dg-dys-syn <dig> regulated mir- <dig> is likely to be primarily involved in nervous system development tuning axon guidance. putative targets involved include transcriptional regulators in well-conserved pathways including tgf-β and epiderman growth factor  signaling. the downregulation of mir- <dig> in pupae relative to the expression levels at other life stages supports that mir- <dig> is ‘off’ to allow for higher levels of proteins necessary for metamorphic neurological remodeling.

mir- <dig> is likely to be necessary to keep muscle development genes at low levels when no longer needed. the small number of potential target genes that is necessary for proper muscle development include the tgf-β ligand glass bottom boat , the transcription factor erect wing , the translation repressor pumilio  and ecdysone receptor , a gene well known to be involved in temporal regulation of growth and development  <cit> . based on our expression analysis mir- <dig> is ‘on’ in adult stages in the thorax and abdomen where it can potentially guard the expression of these genes so that muscle cells remain quiescent. interestingly, very little expression was found in the ovaries even though there are muscle sheaths around each ovary and oviduct, and a muscle sheath connects the two ovaries to the uterus. this suggests that mir- <dig> is not expressed at the same level in all muscle types, and that striated flight muscles and those of the body wall lining the cuticle of the abdomen have a different mirna profile than smooth muscle tissues. dystrophin is considered a terminal differentiation gene in mammalian muscle cells, but no correlative studies have been conducted in drosophila. our data showing that dys controls the levels of a potential muscle cell terminal differentiation mirna in drosophila suggests that dys does have a similar role in this system.

in drosophila, syn <dig> and syn <dig> have not been validated as components of the dgc, but our results in this study support an association between dg, dys and syn <dig>  the embryonic expression of drosophila dgc proteins found that syn <dig> is expressed in the brain and the ventral nerve cord, while syn <dig> is expressed in mesoderm-derived tissues  <cit> . interestingly, all three mirnas studied here can be regulated by the dg-dys-syn <dig> pathway. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were found to be present in the nervous system and mir- <dig> is also present in the musculature. we clearly see a reduction in mir- <dig> levels in tub-gal4/dssyn <dig> animals, suggesting that, at least in adult animals, syn <dig> signaling could be present in the mesoderm as well. accordingly, a study examining both syntrophins in drosophila reported that syn <dig> and syn <dig> can partially compensate for each other’s functions indicating that they can be expressed in the same tissues  <cit> . it is possible that the regulation of mirna levels by the dg-dys-syn <dig> pathway seen in our study is linked to neuronal nitric oxide synthase  signaling, which was reported in mammalian muscle  <cit> . here we have shown that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are all downregulated in mutants with rnai against syn <dig> indicating that a comparable pathway is present in drosophila that is not only present in muscle, but other tissues as well .

no  is a common regulatory molecule that has been shown to be involved in numerous cellular processes including metabolism of energy substrates, diversion of oxygen to nonrespiratory substrates, generation of reactive oxygen species, neurotransmission, and apoptosis to name just a few  <cit> . in drosophila there is only one nos gene  that is expressed in imaginal discs during development, and injection of nos inhibitors prior to metamorphosis results in major developmental defects  <cit> . this is interesting because based on the gene ontology of many of the putative targets, mir- <dig> is involved in regulation of imaginal disc morphogenesis. in adult animals, the dnos transcript is found preferentially in heads, but not bodies  <cit> , and the primary adult tissue that we see mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expressed in is the adult head. future efforts will involve determining if the regulation of these mirnas is dependent on no signaling in drosophila. despite extremely low levels of mir- <dig> expression, mir- <dig> mutants do not show any gross morphological defects. however, its large number of targets involved in several processes allow us to speculate that it is a general housekeeping mirna that fine tunes processes that have been first controlled via other mechanisms.

the mechanism of mirna regulation by dys and/or dg is not fully known at the current time. even though a pathway has been elucidated involving syntrophin mediated signaling for some mirnas, the misregulation of others is mechanistically elusive. we have additionally seen in this study that dg levels impact those of dys and both affect the levels of syn <dig>  this is in accord with another study that found dgc expression profiles are interrelated  <cit> . one explanation of how dgc components regulate other complex proteins is through mirna regulated silencing. accordingly, two prior studies in vertebrates have shown that dys and β1-syntrophin can be targeted by mirnas  <cit> . another intriguing fact is that dgc components have been found in the nucleus, where one dys isoform was found in the nucleus of hela cells and c2c <dig> muscle cells in a complex with β-dystroglycan, β-dystrobrevin and nnos  <cit> . perhaps in the near future it will be determined if dystrophin and its associated proteins can directly regulate transcription of downstream genes.

in order to put into context the limitations of our study we would like to point out that here one sample per genotype per condition was analyzed via microarray. the sample consisted of 3– <dig> whole adult male animals. by combining multiple animals into one sample we hoped to minimize random variability in mirna expression levels in any single animal. this random variability should have been normalized as ‘background noise’. due to the large number of samples we were interested in for this study  we did not perform replicate microarray experiments. additionally, due to this experimental design we set a cutoff value for differential expression at  <dig>  and  <dig>  that of the control for down and upregulation respectively. therefore, it was very important to verify the microarray data we obtained via another method. here we chose rt q-pcr analysis of fifteen mirnas using pooled samples and performed three to five biological replicates. of the  <dig> comparisons made using the rt q-pcr data,  <dig>  agreed with the microarray data. though this could be due to caveats of our experimental design, it has been reported that upon comparison of rt q-pcr based arrays vs. microarrays like the one used here, the former has superior sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . an additional limitation of our study is that we used whole animals which unfortunately does not allow determination of the tissue where specific mirnas are misregulated.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that in drosophila similar to humans, loss of dys alters the mirna profile in a manner that is not exclusive to a signaling pathway involving dg and syn <dig>  in addition to information obtained by previous studies, we have provided evidence in an in vivo animal model that hyperthermic stress can alter mirna levels; a process that is defective in dystrophic mutants. this work supports that the dgc is involved not only in muscle maintenance, but in general for proper development of the whole organism. we also introduce the idea that the dgc has the capability of conducting necessary cellular pathways. these data suggest that one explanation for stress-induced dystrophy in wt animals and stress induced hyperdystrophic symptoms in dgc mutants can be mirna response related. our study adds to the growing knowledge of a strong link between the dgc and nervous system differentiation and functionality.
