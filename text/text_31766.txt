BACKGROUND
the formation of neuronal circuits crucially depends on the correct navigation of axons to their target areas, where they contact individual target cells to establish synaptic contacts. axonal navigation is based on sequential growth from choice point to choice point. pathfinding decisions at choice points and along the axonal trajectory are the consequence of molecular interactions between guidance cues presented by the environment and guidance receptors expressed on the growth cones. a multitude of in vitro and in vivo approaches led to the identification of guidance cues that provide directional information for the navigation of growth cones. the semaphorins are a structurally diverse family of guidance cues. they are subdivided into eight subfamilies, two found in invertebrates, one in viruses, and five in vertebrates. initially, semaphorins were found to be repellents for extending axons. in  <dig>  neuropilins were identified as receptors for semaphorins concurrently in two labs  <cit> ; reviewed in  <cit> . a short time later, a role for plexins as receptors for semaphorins was described  <cit> . however, neuropilins and plexins had been discovered many years earlier as antigens of monoclonal antibodies raised against proteins from the optic tectum of xenopus laevis  <cit> . in contrast to neuropilins, which have only been found in vertebrates, plexins are distributed widely in both vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . the nine plexins found in vertebrates have been subdivided into four subclasses a-d depending on structural criteria. the largest subfamily is the plexina subfamily with four members, followed by the plexinb subfamily with three members. subfamilies c and d contain only one member each.

by far the best-studied plexins are class-a plexins  <cit> . their function has been studied predominantly in context of their role as co-receptors  for secreted class- <dig> semaphorins  <cit> . however, plexinas must have functions that are independent of neuropilins, because they are expressed much more widely in the developing nervous system than neuropilin- <dig> and - <dig>  consistent with this, plexins were shown to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion in a calcium-dependent manner  <cit> . furthermore, plexinas were shown to mediate effects of membrane-bound class- <dig> semaphorins in a neuropilin-independent manner  <cit> .

until recently, when sema3e binding to plexind <dig> in a neuropilin-independent manner was demonstrated during the development of the intersomitic vasculature  <cit> , neuropilins were thought to be required but not sufficient for class- <dig> semaphorin signaling  <cit> . no signaling component in the cytoplasmic part of neuropilins could be identified, suggesting that they confer ligand specificity to the complex formed with plexins, l <dig>  or off-track  <cit> . in contrast to the secreted class- <dig> semaphorins, membrane-associated semaphorins were shown to bind to plexins directly  <cit> .

much less is known about the function of other classes of plexins. an interaction of plexinb <dig> with sema4d has been described, but little is known about the role of plexinbs in vivo  <cit> . plexinc <dig> was demonstrated to interact with sema7a  <cit> , although the only functional study available to date indicates integrins rather than plexinc <dig> as the function-mediating receptor for sema7a  <cit> . plexind <dig> finally was linked to the development of the heart and the vascular system consistent with its predominant expression in endothelial cells  <cit> .

as a step toward a better understanding of the diverse roles of plexins in the developing nervous system, we decided to assess the expression patterns of plexins. here, we describe the expression of all plexins found in the chicken genome during spinal cord development in comparison with neuropilins.

RESULTS
the avian genome lacks homologues for two mammalian plexins
in order to identify chicken plexins and neuropilins we performed extensive databank searches using the combined information from the bbsrc chickest and the genomic database. these searches indicate that the chicken genome encodes a reduced number of plexins compared to mammals, i.e. only seven instead of nine. while homologous chicken genes for the two unique subfamily members plexinc <dig> and plexind <dig> could readily be identified, fewer chicken plexinas and plexinbs are present in the chicken genome when compared to mammals . the plexina subfamily contains no matching chicken sequence for plexina <dig>  furthermore, no counterpart for plexinb <dig> could be extracted from chicken databases . interestingly, the mouse variants of the two missing plexin genes are located on the x chromosome, implying that a homologous region of this chromosome is absent in chicken. birds use a z/w sex determination system instead of the x/y system found in mammals. moreover, in contrast to mammals, in chicken the female is the heterogametic sex , whereas the male is homogametic , further suggesting that intense chromosomal rearrangements happened during evolutionary development  <cit> . these changes are also reflected by the fact that the haploid chicken genome contains  <dig> autosomes compared to only  <dig> autosomes in mouse  <cit> . based on the alignment of human, mouse, and chicken chromosomes, genes found on the mammalian x chromosomes were assigned either to the chicken chromosome  <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> .

the number of identified chicken ests for each gene and the chromosomal location of the chicken and its corresponding mouse gene are given. genes that were not detected are abbreviated by 'n.d.' 1plexinb <dig> has not yet been assigned to a chromosome.

the chicken genome with  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp is only about 40% as long as the human genome, and with an estimated 20' <dig> to 23' <dig> genes the chicken contains fewer genes than the mouse or the human genome, although the difference in gene number is not proportional to the reduction in genome size. the chicken genome contains markedly less repetitive sequence and a reduced number of degraded copies of gene sequence, but also fewer duplicated copies of genes overall  <cit> . thus, our finding that two plexins are missing is most likely due to their actual absence in the genome rather than our inability to detect them in the databases. moreover, all attempts to clone the missing chicken homologues using degenerate primers for rt-pcr failed, again implying that the missing genes are indeed not represented in the chicken genome.

interestingly, while conservation between different chicken plexinas was in the range of  <dig> to 90%, depending on the plexin parts used for alignment, conservation between chicken plexinbs was only around 50% . this value is not much higher than the values obtained when plexinbs were compared to plexins in other subclasses, suggesting that although placed into the same subclass, plexinb <dig> and b <dig> might actually be members of different subclasses.

pairwise alignment of individual domains of chicken plexin proteins indicate that the intracellular sp  domain is highly conserved between the different family members, whereas the two extracellular domains, sema and psi , show far less conservation. interestingly the conservation between individual domains of chicken plexinb <dig> and b <dig> is only slightly higher than the homology between class a and class b plexins, suggesting that chicken plexinbs are evolutionary quite distinct. numbers indicate percentage of identical/conserved amino acids.

the expression patterns of plexins are dynamically regulated during early spinal cord development
we started to analyze plexin expression in the lumbosacral spinal cord at stage  <dig>  <cit> . at this time, motor neurons are born in the ventral spinal cord and start to extend axons. the first plexins detected in motor neurons were plexina <dig> and a <dig> . in addition, motor neurons expressed neuropilin- <dig> , but not npn- <dig>  when compared with markers for precursors and mature neurons , respectively, plexina <dig> and a <dig> were clearly expressed already in precursors of motor neurons, whereas npn- <dig> was restricted to more lateral, mature motor neurons.

more dorsally, plexina <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig> were expressed in pax6-positive precursor cells . in addition, cells in the dorsal spinal cord expressed plexina <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  as well as npn- <dig> . these cells expressed pax <dig>  but did not express neurofilament proteins  and therefore represent precursors of dorsal interneurons  <cit> . at the lumbosacral level of the spinal cord, dorsal commissural neurons derived from these pax7-positive precursors and characterized by the expression of the cell adhesion molecule axonin- <dig> start to extend axons at stage  <dig> . these axons grow toward the floor plate in response to chemoattractants derived from the floor plate, netrin- <dig>  and sonic hedgehog  <cit> . the majority of these axons have reached the floor plate by stage  <dig>  at this stage, dorsal commissural neurons identified by axonin- <dig> expression  <cit>  expressed all three members of the plexina class but neither npn- <dig> nor npn- <dig> . interestingly, plexina <dig> and a <dig> were now also expressed in the floor plate, although plexina <dig> was found only in lateral but not medial floor-plate cells . furthermore, the floor plate was also the earliest site of plexinb <dig> and c <dig> expression in the spinal cord . in contrast to all other plexins, plexinb <dig> was expressed strongly in the entire ventricular zone and at low levels in almost all cells of the spinal cord at stage  <dig> and later.

motor neurons innervating the hindlimb express a large variety of plexins and neuropilins
after stage  <dig>  motor axons reach the plexus region where they have to sort out according to their target muscles. while the first decision is primarily a choice to grow either dorsally or ventrally, more refined pathways are chosen at stages 25/ <dig>  when individual nerves begin to form  <cit> . at that time, motor neurons can be separated into different subpopulations based on the expression pattern of transcription factors  <cit>  or type-ii cadherins  <cit> . at stage  <dig>  all plexins and both neuropilins were expressed in motor neurons . plexina <dig>  a <dig>  and, at low levels, b <dig> were expressed in a pattern overlapping with isl1-positive motor neurons  that coincided with the expression of sc <dig> a surface marker for motor neurons c <dig> . in contrast, the expression of plexind <dig> and npn- <dig> was strong in medial motor neurons labeled by mnr <dig> but not by isl <dig> . npn- <dig> appeared to be expressed predominantly in a dorsolateral subset of isl1-positive cells. plexina <dig> and c <dig> were scattered throughout the ventral horn without clear resemblance to either the isl <dig> or the mnr <dig> pattern and expression levels were rather low. this was also true for plexinb <dig> that was expressed throughout the neural tube with higher levels found in dorsal commissural neurons, the floor plate, and the ventricular zone. in addition to plexinb <dig>  the floor plate maintained expression of plexina <dig>  and c <dig> at stage  <dig>  plexina <dig> was still detectable in lateral floor-plate cells, although at lower levels. dorsolateral commissural neurons still expressed all plexinas, plexinb <dig>  and c <dig>  but no neuropilin.

during intermediate stages of spinal cord development plexin expression is reduced
the early phase of spinal cord development that we analyzed  is characterized by the birth and differentiation of neuronal populations  <cit> . this two-day period  revealed fundamental changes in the expression patterns of plexins and neuropilins . in contrast, the expression patterns changed much less during the next two to three days, the intermediate phase of spinal cord development. at stage  <dig> , the expression pattern of plexinas remained the same as at stage  <dig>  except for the decrease of plexina <dig> in the dorsal half of the spinal cord. plexinb <dig> persisted only in the ventral ventricular zone, and plexinb <dig> disappeared altogether. plexinc <dig> was now expressed diffusely throughout the gray matter with higher levels in the lateral motor column and the floor plate. after its transient expression in motor neurons at stages  <dig>  and  <dig>  plexind <dig> was no longer expressed in the spinal cord but was restricted to endothelial cells of the blood vessels as described for the mouse  <cit> . the expression of npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> at stage  <dig>  remained largely complementary in different populations of motor neurons as already indicated at stage  <dig> . the expression patterns of the neuropilins in motor neurons did not resemble those of any of the plexins. a more detailed analysis of the individual subpopulations expressing plexins and neuropilins would exceed the scope of this study and would require double and triple staining for transcription factors of the ets and lim homeodomain families  <cit>  or comparison with the analysis of type-ii cadherin expression patterns in motor neuron pools  <cit> . the analysis of whole-mount preparations of stage  <dig> spinal cords did not reveal any substantial changes in the expression patterns of plexins and neuropilins throughout the lumbosacral level .

late stages of spinal cord development
during late stages of spinal cord development, between stages  <dig>  and  <dig> , motor axons have reached their target muscles and sensory afferents terminate in their specific target layers of the gray matter. expression patterns of plexins and neuropilins still changed. overall their levels decreased and their spatial extent became more restricted. fundamental changes in expression were observed for npn- <dig> that was found in the dorsal spinal cord during late stages of spinal cord development, but not during early and intermediate stages, where it had been restricted to the ventral spinal cord.

another significant change was found for plexinb <dig> that was detected in cells located in the funiculi all around the spinal cord at stage  <dig> . the expression of plexinb <dig>  correlated with areas of o <dig> expression, a marker for oligodendrocytes  but not with gfap expression, a marker for astrocytes .

at late stages of development, the expression of plexins was restricted to the dorsal gray matter, or was turned off altogether . strong expression only persisted for plexina <dig> and c <dig> in the dorsal horn, in laminae i – iii .

drgs exhibit a dynamic plexin expression pattern
dorsal root ganglia expressed a variety of plexins during different stages of development. during early stages , when sensory neurons extend processes into the periphery but before collaterals of central processes are formed , plexina <dig>  a <dig>  and npn- <dig> transcripts were found at high levels; low levels were detectable for plexina <dig>  b <dig>  and npn- <dig> at stage  <dig> . at stage  <dig>  expression patterns were unchanged for plexins but levels had switched for neuropilins, i.e. npn- <dig> was expressed at higher, npn- <dig> at lower levels at stage  <dig> compared to stage  <dig> .

at stage  <dig>  when sensory neurons start to extend collaterals into the gray matter of the spinal cord , high levels of plexina <dig> were maintained in drgs , whereas levels of plexina <dig> and b <dig> had decreased. plexinc <dig> expression levels started to increase . plexina <dig> remained restricted to a subset of cells. interestingly, the expression of npn- <dig> became restricted to sensory neurons located in the dorsal-most part of the drg at stage  <dig>  as nociceptive, mechanoreceptive, and proprioceptive neurons are segregated in the chicken drg, these cells are most likely nociceptive neurons  <cit> .

at stage  <dig>  plexina <dig> and a <dig> were only found in a few cells located in the periphery of the drg, where proprioceptive neurons are located .

discussion
plexinas have a more widespread distribution compared to neuropilins
the distribution of class-a plexins has been studied in more detail than other plexin subfamilies  <cit> . their function has been analyzed predominantly in context of their role as co-receptors  for secreted class- <dig> semaphorins  <cit>  but see  <cit> . however, based on their much more dynamic and more widespread expression, a neuropilin-independent role of plexinas is evident. in particular, the observation that plexins are expressed in the floor plate is rather unexpected, as the floor plate is the intermediate target of commissural axons, and therefore, the site where ligands for axonal guidance receptors should be expressed. a receptor function of plexins on floor-plate cells at stage  <dig> is not obvious, as floor-plate cells do not migrate or undergo structural remodeling at this time. floor-plate development is terminated much earlier  <cit> .

as mentioned above, the chicken genome contains only three members of the a class: plexina <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  the available expression patterns of class-a plexins  <cit>  fail to reflect the dynamics of plexina-expression changes shown in this study. at e <dig> , plexina <dig> is reported to be barely detectable in the mouse spinal cord and drgs  <cit> . plexina <dig> was found in the roof plate and in interneurons of the ventral spinal cord but not in motor neurons of the trunk region  <cit> . at more rostral levels, plexina <dig> was found in the dorsal spinal cord and in drgs. reports of plexina <dig> expression were contradictory. brown et al.  <cit>  reported plexina <dig> expression in the ventricular zone and in the floor plate, whereas cheng et al.  <cit>  reported plexina <dig> to be expressed throughout the spinal cord . the reason for this discrepancy is unclear. compared to the expression pattern in chick, the pattern of plexina <dig> reported by brown et al.  <cit>  is almost identical to the one we found for plexinb <dig> at stage  <dig> . the pattern of plexina <dig> in the e <dig>  spinal cord of the mouse was restricted to a single population of cells in the lateral spinal cord and to the drgs  <cit> . with respect to the development of sensory afferents to the spinal cord, e <dig>  in the mouse is comparable to stage  <dig> in the chick. the development of motor neurons at e <dig>  is closer to stage  <dig>  we therefore used both stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> spinal cords to compare the plexina patterns between mouse and chick. while plexina <dig> and a <dig> patterns did not change considerably between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  plexina <dig> levels decreased strongly in the dorsal spinal cord and in the drgs. consistent with the pattern reported by brown et al.  <cit>  in mouse, plexina <dig> was expressed in the roof plate at stage  <dig>  however, in contrast to the chick, mouse plexina <dig> was not expressed in the floor plate.

plexinbs are only transiently expressed in neurons
the expression of class-b plexins is difficult to link to any specific function. they are expressed in neurons, although only transiently, and in glial cells. the most prominent and longest lasting expression for a class-b plexin is seen in the ventricular zone, where plexinb <dig> is expressed from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  this pattern is consistent with the mouse, where plexinb <dig> was found in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord at e <dig>   <cit> . at stage  <dig> in the chick, plexinb <dig> is restricted to cells in the white matter, presumably oligodendrocytes. this is in contrast to the expression of plexinb <dig> in mouse  <cit> . in mouse, plexinb <dig> is expressed in cells of the white matter resembling the expression of plexinb <dig> in chick. furthermore, the expression of plexinb <dig>  which has been reported to match the expression of plexinb <dig> in the ventricular zone of e <dig>  mice  <cit> , differs in chick, where levels of plexinb <dig> are generally low in the spinal cord and peripheral ganglia. a very weak transient expression of plexinb <dig> and b <dig> is detectable throughout the gray matter and in motor neurons between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. during that time expression is also found in the drgs and along the ventral roots, which would indicate that these cells are early schwann cells aligning with motor axons. in contrast to observations in the mouse  <cit>  plexinbs are not expressed during the time when sensory afferents target their specific layers in gray matter, as no expression is detectable between stages  <dig> to  <dig>  in the chick, collaterals of primary sensory axons do not form before stage  <dig>  <cit> . thus, a contribution of both plexinb <dig> and b <dig> to the formation of central sensory connections seems rather unlikely in the chick in contrast to mouse, where plexinb <dig> was found in drgs from e <dig>  to e <dig>   <cit> .

plexinc <dig> is not expressed in early stages of neural development
in contrast to plexinas, which are expressed during the time when neurons extend their axons, plexinc <dig> is expressed only during late stages of neural development. neither commissural neurons nor motor neurons express plexinc <dig> during the time when they approach their first intermediate target, the floor plate and the plexus region, respectively. interestingly, strong expression of plexinc <dig> is seen in the floor plate at stage  <dig> , i.e. when the majority of the axons from dorsolateral commissural neurons are in the floor plate  <cit> . the expression in the floor plate persists through stage  <dig>  when commissural axons have crossed the midline and turned into the longitudinal axis  <cit> . a massive increase in plexinc <dig> expression in drgs is found at stage  <dig>  a time when all other plexins are downregulated compared to their earlier expression levels in drgs. plexinc <dig> expression in drgs persists at stage  <dig>  thus, plexinc <dig> starts to be expressed in all neuronal subpopulations that we analyzed when axons have completed the navigation to their targets suggesting that plexinc <dig> might be involved in target recognition rather than pathfinding. this would be consistent with the finding of pasterkamp et al.  <cit>  who reported that the effect of semaphorin7a, which binds to plexinc <dig> with high affinity  <cit> , on axon growth was independent of plexinc <dig> but rather mediated by semaphorin7a's interaction with integrins.

plexind <dig> is expressed predominantly in endothelial cells
plexind <dig> is expressed transiently in motor neurons in a subpopulation-specific manner between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  it is not expressed in the spinal cord during initial axon growth of motor neurons. only after motor axons have reached the plexus region, some medially located cell populations express plexind <dig> at stage  <dig>  as described in mouse  <cit> , plexind <dig> is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells of the developing intersomitic blood vessels during early stages of development and in blood vessels in general during later stages.

the expression of neuropilin- <dig> in chick is much more restricted than in mouse
the expression of npn- <dig>  but not npn- <dig>  in the developing chicken spinal cord differs considerably from the expression pattern reported in mouse. neuropilin- <dig> is expressed in drgs and motor neurons in e <dig>  and e <dig>  mouse spinal cord  <cit>  in a pattern that is similar to the expression in chick at stages 22– <dig> . the expression seen in mouse spinal cord at e <dig>   <cit>  is virtually the same as seen in chick at stage  <dig> .

in contrast to the widespread expression of npn- <dig> in the mouse spinal cord between e <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> , the expression in the embryonic chicken spinal cord is much more restricted at comparable stages. in mouse, npn- <dig> is expressed very strongly in dorsal commissural neurons, in ventral populations of interneurons, in motor neurons, and in the floor plate. functional studies have identified a role for npn- <dig> in commissural axon pathfinding in the mouse  <cit> . in chick, npn- <dig> is not expressed in the dorsal spinal cord at comparable stages. it is restricted to some pools of motor neurons and becomes further restricted with increasing embryonic age. moreover, npn- <dig> is never expressed in the embryonic chicken floor plate.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of plexin and neuropilin expression during development of the spinal cord reflects their dynamic regulation that coincides with time windows of axon growth and guidance of different neuronal populations. plexinas are expressed more widely than any other class of plexins both temporally and spatially. notably they are also expressed more widely than the neuropilins, indicating that they must have functions that are neuropilin-independent. this aspect is underestimated when global expression patterns are compared rather than the detailed subpopulation-specific expression patterns. plexinbs are expressed during early and intermediate stages of spinal cord development but always at low levels and rather ubiquitously. plexinc <dig> is expressed predominantly during late stages of development, whereas plexind <dig> is expressed only very transiently in the spinal cord.
