BACKGROUND
nowadays low-cost energy bio-industrial processes in biotechnology are highly desired. this has led to increased interest in the production of cold adapted enzymes. one class of such enzymes includes cold-adapted β-d-galactosidases  that can find many applications in industrial biotechnology. these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing  <dig> -β-d-galactoside linkages and can sometimes catalyse the synthesis of oligosaccharides. the production of lactose-free milk and synthetic oligosaccharides like lactulose are only examples of this cutting edge enzyme class application.

currently, commercially available β-galactosidase preparations  applied for lactose hydrolysis contain kluyveromyces lactis β-galactosidase naturally intracellularly biosynthesized by k. lactis strains. this enzyme is optimally active at approximately 50°c and displays low activity at 20°c while an ideal enzyme for treating milk should work well at 4–8°c. besides, the latter enzyme should be optimally active at ph  <dig> – <dig>  and cannot be inhibited by sodium, calcium or glucose. such β-galactosidases are still highly desired. only several enzymes optimally hydrolyzing lactose at low temperatures have been characterized till now  <cit> , however, none of them have been produced on the commercial scale. the β-galactosidases were obtained from different microbial sources, including those from arthrobacter sp.  <cit> , arthrobacter psychrolactophilus  <cit> carnobacterium piscicola  <cit> , planococcus sp.  <cit> , pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis  <cit> , and pseudoalteromonas sp.  <cit> .

additionally, in order to make progress in cheaper production of β-d-galactosidases of industrial interest, high efficiency yeast expression systems must be taken into consideration. on the other hand extracellular production must occur to allow easy and fast isolation of target protein. there are several studies in literature related to the extracellular production of the aspergillus niger β-galactosidase by recombinant saccharomyces cerevisiae strains  <cit> , although this enzyme is mainly interesting for lactose hydrolysis in acid whey, because of their acidic ph optimum as well as their activity at elevated temperatures. the s. cerevisiae expression system was also used for the production of k. lactis β-d-galactosidase, the protein of outstanding biotechnological interest in the food industry but in this case the enzyme production was not strictly extracellular. the β-galactosidase was released into the culture medium after osmotic shock of the recombinant s. cerevisiae osmotic-remedial thermosensitive-autolytic mutants  <cit> . to improve the secretion of the k. lactis β-d-galactosidase, cytosolic in origin, the hybrid protein from this enzyme and its a. niger homologue, that is naturally extracellular, was constructed. the hybrid protein was active and secreted by recombinant k. lactis strain, but the amount of extracellular enzyme still remained low  <cit> . yeast species especially designated for the production of extracellular proteins are for example pichia pastoris or hansenula polymorpha. there is only one recently published example of an extracellular β-galactosidase production system using p. pastoris as a host, however, it concerns thermostable enzyme from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius  <cit> .

s. cerevisiae is usually the first choice for industrial processes involving alcoholic fermentation but this yeast is unable to metabolize lactose and, therefore, the lactose consuming yeast, k. fragilis, has been used in most industrial plants producing ethanol from whey  <cit> . the engineering of s. cerevisiae for lactose utilization has been addressed over the past  <dig> years by different strategies  <cit> . however, most recombinant strains obtained displayed no ideal characteristics  or were ineffective for ethanol production  <cit> . there is only one published example of efficient ethanol production with a recombinant s. cerevisiae strain expressing the lac <dig>  and lac <dig>  genes of k. lactis  <cit> . hence, there is still a need for s. cerevisiae strains producing new β-galactosidases which may appear to be an interesting alternative for the production of ethanol from lactose-based feedstock.

in this respect, here we report on a new cold-adapted β-d-galactosidase, isolated from psychrothrophic, antarctic arthrobacter sp. 32c bacterium strain, that possesses low molecular weight of  <dig>  kda of monomer and  <dig> kda of native protein. in addition, the presented enzyme is active in the range of temperature 4–8°c that is suitable for milk industry applications and can be produced extracellularly on a large scale using recombinant p. pastoris strains cultivated either on methanol or glycerol .

RESULTS
characterisation of 32c isolate
many different colonies were isolated from the antarctic soil. one isolate, named 32c, that formed yellow colonies was chosen for further study because of its ability to hydrolyze x-gal – the cromogenic analogue of lactose. the cells were gram-negative rods. the optimum growth in las medium was observed between 25–27°c. no growth occurred at 37°c. in order to determine the ability of the selected isolate to utilize starch, milk, avicell or arabinose several plates with different substrates were prepared. it was observed that 32c strain produces enzymes of industrial interest like α-amylase, proteases and has an arabinose utilization pathway. in order to estimate the phylogenetic position of the isolate, we cloned the amplified 16s rrna gene into pcr-blunt vector, determined its sequence, and examined its phylogenetic relationships . the obtained sequence was deposited at genbank with the accession no. fj <dig>  an analysis of the sequence showed that it clustered with other organisms isolated from cold environments, mainly belonging to arthrobacter species. the isolate formed a well-defined cluster with a. oxidans  and a. polychromogenes . based on 16s rdna similarity, physiological properties similar to other arthrobacter strains and its presence in the antarctic soil our isolate was classified as arthrobacter sp. 32c.

characterisation of the β-d-galactosidase gene
the psychrotrophic arthrobacter sp. 32c chromosomal library was prepared in e. coli top10f'. the plasmid pbadmychisa was used to construct the library, and ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected and screened for the ability to hydrolyze x-gal. several transformants out of approximately  <dig>  were selected as blue colonies on plates containing x-gal. restriction analysis of plasmid inserts from these transformants indicated that they had been derived from the same fragment of chromosomal dna. sequence data from the shortest construct, named pbadmychisalibb32c, contained  <dig>  bp insert with an open reading frame  encoding protein, which shares high homology to a β-d-galactosidase . the sequence of arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase was analyzed and found to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein with a predicted mass of  <dig>  kda and a theoretical pi of  <dig> . the analysis of dna sequence upstream the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase gene with the promoter prediction tool  revealed a potential promoter sequence with cttaca and tacaat as - <dig> and - <dig> sequences, respectively. a putative ribosomal binding site was apparent  <dig> bases before the initiating methionine codon. the insert fragment and β-d-galactosidase gene had a high g+c content,  <dig> mol% and  <dig> mol%, respectively, which is typical of arthrobacter species.

a comparison of the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase gene sequence with those from the ncbi database showed that it was most closely related to the arthrobacter sp. fb <dig> gene  and to the a. aurescens tc <dig> gene  . the deduced amino acid sequence from arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase gene was also used to compare with other amino acid sequences deposited in the ncbi database. the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase was found to be a member of the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> and contained an a <dig> beta-galactosidase fold. the enzyme shares 84% of identity and 91% of similarity to the sequence of the arthrobacter sp. fb <dig>  74% identity and 84% similarity to the sequence of the arthrobacter aurescens tc <dig> and only 51% identity and 65% similarity to the sequence of the janibacter sp. htcc <dig> β-d-galactosidase.

overexpression and purification of recombinant arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase
in order to produce and investigate the biochemical properties of arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase, we constructed bacterial and yeast expression systems. the recombinant arabinose-inducible pbad-myc-hisa-β-gal32c plasmid was used for the expression of the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase gene in e. coli lmg194/plysn  <cit> . the highest enzyme biosynthesis yields were achieved by adding arabinose to the final concentration of  <dig> % w/w, at a <dig>  <dig>  and by further cultivation for  <dig> h. after purification a single protein migrating near  <dig> kda was observed following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with coomassie blue . it was in good agreement with the molecular mass deduced from the nucleotide sequence . the applied overexpression system was quite efficient, giving  <dig> mg  of purified β-d-galactosidase from  <dig> l of induced culture. the relative molecular mass of native enzyme estimated by gel filtration on a column of superdex  <dig> hr 10/ <dig>  previously calibrated with protein molecular mass standards, was  <dig>  da. hence, it is assumed that the purified arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase is probably a trimeric protein.

in the p. pastoris expression system the methanol induced and constitutive biosynthesis variants for larger scale production of the enzyme were tested. by cloning the gene in the form of translational fusion with the s. cerevisiae α-factor leader sequence under the control of either the methanol induced promoter aox <dig> or under the constitutive promoter gap, ppiczαa-32cβ-gal and pgapzαa-32cβ-gal recombinant expression plasmids were constructed. p. pastoris gs <dig> strain was transformed with linearized ppiczαa-32cβ-gal or pgapzαa-32cβ-gal plasmids. the obtained p. pastoris gs <dig> recombinant strains harbouring pgapzαa-32cβ-gal or ppiczαa-32cβ-gal recombinant plasmids were used for extracellular production of the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase . the applied overexpression systems were efficient, giving approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mg  of purified β-d-galactosidase  from  <dig> l of induced culture for the aox <dig> and constitutive system, respectively. noteworthy is the fact that all attempts in extracellular expression of β-d-galactosidase from pseudoalteromonas sp.22b  <cit>  previously described by us did not succeed . the corresponded β-d-galactosidase is a tetramer composed of  <dig> kda subunits. all the amount of produced protein with fused secretion signal was accumulated in the cells. we also tried to produce the pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b β-d-galactosidase in the form of fusion protein with other secretion sequences: pho <dig> and sta <dig>  all attempts gave negative results. it seems that molecular mass of desired recombinant protein is limited for extracellular production by p. pastoris host.

characterization of arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase
the temperature profiles of the hydrolytic activity of the recombinant arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase showed that the highest specific activity with onpg was at 50°c . lowering or raising temperature from 50°c resulted in the reduction of β-d-galactosidaseactivity. recombinant β-d-galactosidase exhibited 15% of the maximum activity even at 0°c and approximately 60% at 25°c . in order to determine the optimum ph for recombinant β-d-galactosidase, we measured the enzyme activity at various ph values  at 0–70°c, using onpg as a substrate. β-d-galactosidase exhibited maximum activity in ph  <dig>  and over 90% of its maximum activity in the ph range of  <dig> – <dig>  .

to examine the possible metal ion requirements, the enzyme preparation was treated with edta to remove metal ions. no activity was lost during treatment with  <dig> mm edta after  <dig> h. the activity was not considerably affected by metal ions : na+, k+, mg2+, co2+, ca2+. the enzyme activity was completely inhibited by cu2+ or zn2+  and was strongly inhibited by mn2+ , fe2+ and ni2+  in comparison to the activity of the enzyme in the absence of cations  . the activity of the β-d-galactosidase was not considerably affected by ditiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, and l-cysteine, whereas reduced glutathione almost completely inactivated the enzyme . the examination of the ethanol influence on the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidaseactivity with onpg as the substrate shows that addition of ethanol up to 20% still slightly stimulates the enzyme activity . the relative enzyme activity was increasing up to 120% in the presence of 8% v/v ethanol at ph  <dig> .

a study of the substrate specificity of the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase was performed with the use of various chromogenic nitrophenyl analogues. the recombinant arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase displayed four times higher level of activity with pnpg  than with onpg  as substrate. the activities with pnpglu  and onpglu  were significantly lower with only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the activity with onpg, respectively.

in order to further characterize the biochemical properties of the enzyme the highest specific activity kcat, the km values and the catalysis efficiency kcat/km in reaction with onpg and lactose were calculated. the highest observed specific activity with onpg was  <dig>  s- <dig> at 50°c. the half saturation coefficient  was highest at 10°c , decreased to  <dig>  mm at 50°c and rose again to  <dig>  mm at 55°c. the highest catalysis efficiency was achieved at 50°c . the same kinetic parameters were also determined with lactose . hereby the half saturation coefficient was significantly higher, the reaction velocity constant was significantly lower and the reaction efficiency was very low. to investigate the reason for such results another test was performed, where glucose was transformed in the reaction mixture by glucose isomerase that converted it to fructose, while galactose remained in the mixture. in this test the reaction efficiency was significantly higher and over 30% from the 5% w/v of lactose was hydrolysed to glucose and galactose for  <dig> hours and over 75% of the lactose was found to be hydrolysed after  <dig> hours. these results were similar to another test where the recombinant p. pastoris strain extracellularly producing arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase  was cultivated on lactose containing broth. it seems obvious that arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase is inhibited by glucose. nevertheless this shows that the enzyme might successfully catalyse the conversion of lactose to corresponding monocarbohydrates in a fermentation broth where glucose is consumed by cells of the fermenting strain.

discussion
the β-d-galactosidase from arthrobacter sp. 32c characterized in this study has interesting industrial properties. it displays optimum activity at ph  <dig>  and catalyses the hydrolysis of  <dig> -β-d-galactoside linkages at ph  <dig> – <dig>  with high efficiency. its optimum activity was observed at about 50°c. nevertheless it showed over 50% of activity at ph  <dig> – <dig>  at 30°c and was not considerably inactivated by ca2+ ions what in fact can be of interest in industrial ethanol production from cheese whey by means of brewing saccharomyces cerevisiae strains or by recombinant strains that simultaneously utilize glucose and galactose.

β-d-galactosidases naturally produced by psychrophilic microorganisms are either intracellular or expressed at low levels. in order to make progress in cheaper production of β-d-galactosidases of industrial interest, we choose highly efficient p. pastoris expression systems for consideration to produce enzyme extracellularly. p. pastoris has been successfully used many times in extracellular protein production, however, there are only several examples of cold-adapted proteins and none cold-adapted β-d-galactosidase produced by this host. we have found only one published example of p. pastoris extracellular β-d-galactosidase production for a thermostable enzyme from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius  <cit> .

there are several examples of cold active β-d-galactosidases isolated from pseudoalteromonas strains  <cit>  and arthrobacter strains  <cit>  with molecular mass above  <dig> kda of monomer and forming an active enzyme of over  <dig> kda. most of them belong to the family  <dig> β-d-galactosidases. however, the β-d-galactosidase belonging to family  <dig> obtained from the antarctic arthrobacter isolate appears to be one of the most cold-active enzymes characterized to date  <cit> . all of the known cold-adapted β-d-galactosidases, except two of them isolated from planococcus sp. strains  <cit>  and from arthrobacter sp. 32c , form very large oligomers and therefore are of minor interest in industrial application probably because of many problems in effective overexpression. the β-d-galactosidases isolated from psychrophilic planococcus sp. strains have low molecular weight of about  <dig> kda of monomer and about  <dig> kda of native protein. the β-d-galactosidase isolated from planococcus sp. l <dig> is particularly thermolabile, loosing its activity within only  <dig> min at 45°c  <cit>  and therefore larger scale production of this enzyme by recombinant yeast strains cultivated at 30°c might be economically not feasible. only the β-d-galactosidase from planococcus sp. isolate sos orange  <cit>  displays interesting activity and might be considered in biotechnological production on a larger scale.

in comparison with known β-d-galactosidases, the arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase is a protein with a relatively low molecular weight. molecular sieving revealed that the active enzyme is a trimmer with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> ±  <dig> kda. relatively low molecular weight of the protein did not interfere with extracellular production of the protein by p. pastoris. therefore the constructed recombinant strains of p. pastoris may serve to produce the protein extracellularly with high efficiency and in a cheap way. the calculated production cost of  <dig> mg of purified β-d-galactosidase was estimated at  <dig>  €.

the same pichia pastoris expression systems had been unsuccessfully used for extracellular expression of previously reported β-d-galactosidase from pseudoalteromonas sp. 22b  <cit> . this enzyme is much bigger than arthrobacter sp. 32c β-d-galactosidase and forms a tetramer of approximately  <dig> kda. it is worth noting that we have tried to secrete this enzyme with three different secretion signals  with no success. it seems that the molecular mass of the desired recombinant protein is limited to extracellular production by p. pastoris host, whereas the used secretion signal is without any influence. based on our experience with pichia pastoris expression systems we assert that the larger protein the lower expression yield can be achieved.

in comparison with the known β-d-galactosidase from planococcus sp. isolate sos orange  <cit> , β-d-galactosidase from arthrobacter sp. 32c is more thermostable and it has a similar activity profile. moreover, as shown in this study, it can be produced extracellularly in high amounts by yeast strain. the displayed activity profile of the arthrobacter β-d-galactosidase, especially the activity at ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , over 50% of relative activity at 30°c and enhancement of the activity by the presence of ethanol suggest that this enzyme is compatible with the industrial process conditions for ethanol production by yeast. the construction of corresponding s. cerevisiae recombinant strains and fermentation tests for the production of ethanol from cheese whey by the application of this β-d-galactosidase are pending.

the arthrobacter β-d-galactosidase was strongly inhibited by glucose and therefore the catalysis efficiency was very low. removal of this product resulted in 75% hydrolysis of a solution containing 5% of lactose after  <dig> hours in a combined enzyme assay. these results clearly indicate that the enzyme can be used for the production of sweet lactose free milk where hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose is performed by simultaneous isomerisation of glucose to fructose by glucose isomerase.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present the purification and characterisation of a new β-d-galactosidase from arthrobacter sp. 32c. from the sequence analyses it is obvious that the protein is a member of the family  <dig> β-d-galactosidases. the protein weight deduced from the  <dig> amino acid sequence was  <dig>  kda. molecular sieving revealed that the active enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> ±  <dig> kda and therefore it is probably a trimmer. the new characterised β-d-galactosidase is of industrial interest and can be produced extracellularly in its economically feasible variant by the constructed p. pastoris strain.

the constructed p. pastoris strain may be used in co-fermentation of lactose from cheese whey by a consortium of microorganisms with industrial strains of brewing yeast s. cerevisiae, where the p. pastoris produces β-d-galactosidase in the oxygen phase and accelerates the shift between the oxidative and reductive conditions.
