BACKGROUND
trichothecene mycotoxins are toxic sesquiterpenoid secondary metabolites produced by mostly plant pathogenic fungi of the genera trichothecium, myrothecium, trichoderma, and fusarium  <cit> . deoxynivalenol , accumulates in infected small grain cereals and is a virulence factor of f. graminearum in the course of fusarium head blight  disease, potentially causing health problems to humans and animals  <cit> . trichothecin  is produced by the grape dry rot pathogen trichothecium roseum and can be found in red wine  <cit> . ttc may have mainly antagonistic activity against competing fungi and is more toxic to yeast, presumably due to higher membrane permeability caused by a hydrophobic side chain . the primary mode of action of both don and ttc is inhibition of eukaryotic protein synthesis  <cit> . depending on the organism, cell type, exposure and trichothecene derivative exposure can cause a variety of phenotypes. in wheat, don is a virulence factor for f. graminearum required for fungal spread  <cit>  and is produced in the early stages during the host-pathogen interaction  <cit> . in animals, trichothecenes cause pleiotropic systemic effects ranging from feed refusal to immune suppression  <cit> . in mammalian cells, don induces activation of double-stranded rna-associated protein kinase , recruits and induces map kinases  which in turn activate their downstream targets, and promotes degradation of 28s rrna  <cit> . prolonged don exposure triggers apoptosis and rrna cleavage  <cit> . in plants, trichothecenes modulate abiotic stress signalling and lead to the induction of oxidative stress and cell death  <cit> .

the plant-fungal interaction is complicated with trichothecenes apparently playing several roles in a biological arms race. genetic analysis of fusarium-host interaction and trichothecene effects is up to now most thoroughly developed for wheat, barley and maize. in wheat over  <dig> quantitative trait loci  have been described to contribute to resistance  <cit> . qfhs.ndsu-3bs, is strongly contributing to fusarium spreading and toxin resistance  and contains the  fhb <dig> resistance gene. it is likely that inhibition of protein synthesis by don is not the only factor interfering with plant cellular physiology. don is required for efficient infection of wheat. f. graminearum tri <dig> mutants which are unable to produce don are prevented from spreading to the next spikelet, however are infectious. metabolomic studies suggested that trichothecenes and especially don are not only inhibiting protein biosynthesis but also directly repress plant resistance mechanisms  <cit> . another layer of complexity of the fungus-toxin-host system is introduced by the multiple ways of toxin biotransformation. in wheat, glucosylation and glutathione conjugation are major routes of don biotransformation  <cit> . the overall role of toxin production for the fungal life cycle is not clear. plant pathogenic fungi like fusarium are saprophytes during large parts of the year and trichothecenes might protect infected grains against feeders, thus perhaps improving survival of f. graminearum spores and grains. trichothecene metabolites may also provide protection against fungivores such as mites and insects  <cit> . furthermore, they could play a role in the competition with other microbes co-occurring in soil and plant debris or provide protection against mycoparasitic fungi. nevertheless, the effect of trichothecenes on cells and animals usually not involved in the plant versus fungal warfare is of economic significance. in experimental animal models, acute don poisoning causes emesis, whereas chronic low-dose exposure elicits anorexia, growth retardation, immunotoxicity as well as impaired reproduction and development resulting from maternal intoxication. pathophysiologic effects associated with don include altered neuroendocrine signalling, proinflammatory gene induction, disruption of the growth hormone axis, and altered gut integrity  <cit> .

despite investigative efforts, the systemic effect of trichothecene toxicity is not well-understood and there is a gap in our knowledge about general mechanisms that can protect cells against trichothecene toxins. here we investigate the impact of don and ttc on the simple eukaryotic model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae. yeast genetics pointed early to the molecular targets of trichothecene toxicity and showed inhibition of eukaryotic translation by targeting the yeast ribosomal protein l <dig>  <cit> . the yeast deletion collection is a perfect tool to study effects of drugs in a systematic genetics analysis  and has even been used for a yeast genetics experiment in space  <cit> . two genetic survey studies have been reported identifying yeast mutants resistant and hypersensitive to ttc  <cit> . these studies both suggested that ttc sensitivity is connected to mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting intracellular oxidative stress. to gain insights into the don defence response of a simple eukaryotic cell we screened the yeast deletion collection for sensitive strains and performed gene expression profiling. the don sensitivity of yeast was increased in our screen by elimination of the drug efflux abc transporter pdr <dig>  interestingly, pdr <dig> has not been listed as gene involved in ttc resistance in a previous study  <cit> . pdr <dig> contributes highly to yeast don and ttc resistance and is controlled by the status of the mitochondria  <cit> . thus elimination of this pathway should reveal intracellular hotspots for general trichothecene resistance. yeast genes isolated here in a background lacking pdr <dig> point to cytoplasmic efficiency and rrna synthesis as rate limiting for fitness in the presence of don and ttc.

RESULTS
to define the impact of don on cellular processes we screened the yeast deletion library for mutants exhibiting sensitivity to don and ttc. a previous study analysed yeast deletion mutants treated with ttc  <cit> . such a screen has not been reported for don due to its low toxicity in yeast. to focus on specific intracellular mechanisms conferring resistance we tried to reduce drug efflux. our initial observations suggested a major role of the abc-type drug efflux pump pdr <dig> and that this protein is necessary and sufficient to confer resistance to the trichothecenes don and ttc. in yeast, pdr <dig> and numerous abc transporters and pleiotropic drug resistance genes are regulated by the transcription factors pdr <dig> and pdr <dig>  <cit> . deletion of both genes  leads to higher ttc and don sensitivity and deletion of pdr <dig> causes an even stronger toxin sensitivity phenotype . trichothecene resistance can be restored in a pdr <dig> pdr <dig> double mutant by constitutive high adh <dig> promoter driven expression of pdr <dig> alone . a gain of function allele of pdr <dig>  leads to overexpression of pdr <dig> and other drug resistance genes  <cit>  and causes increased resistance to high concentrations of ttc. deleting pdr <dig> in the dominant pdr1- <dig> background leads to toxin sensitivity, indicating that other genes upregulated by pdr1- <dig> do not play a major role . as expected, a deletion of pdr <dig> did also confer higher sensitivity against don in the strain background of the knock out collection . elimination of the pdr <dig> gene from the collection was an important step to lower the required don concentration. a further advantage of the absence of pdr <dig> from the knockout collection is that we avoid those mutants which are don/ttc sensitive due to changed pdr <dig> expression. expression of pdr <dig> is not constitutive  <cit>  and subject to retrograde signaling  <cit> . a conserved mechanism is increasing the expression of the transcription factor pdr <dig> in yeast leading to enhanced pdr <dig> expression. similarly, in the related yeast candida glabrata cgpdr <dig> induces the pdr <dig> homolog cdr <dig>  <cit> . importantly, don exposure increases pdr <dig> and pdr <dig> expression  <cit> . thus, one difference of our study to previous ones is the insensitivity of our pdr <dig> deleted mutant collection to variations of pdr <dig> levels.fig.  <dig> pdr <dig> confers ttc and don resistance. logarithmic phase cultures in ypd medium were diluted to od <dig>  <dig> . then 5 μl of this and three serial 1: <dig> dilutions were spotted on ypd plates containing the indicated amount of toxin. a the isogenic set of strains is derived from strain fy1679-28c. b the congenic set of strains is derived from yala-b <dig> and yala-g <dig>  see material and methods for strain construction. c pdr <dig> mediates don resistance in the mutant strains collection background. by <dig> and by4741pdr5Δ were spotted in serial dilution on don containing ypd medium



the library of double mutants was generated using the sga protocol  <cit> . the query strain carrying the pdr <dig> gene knockout was mated with the strains of the yeast deletion collection. the diploid strains were selected and then sporulated. the desired haploid double mutant segregants were obtained by counter selection against the diploid and other meiotic products  <cit> . the initial screen for sensitive double mutants of this library was performed with 70 mg/l don and  <dig>  mg/l ttc on solid rich medium and followed by a subsequent rescreening. we identified a total of  <dig> strains of which  <dig> were don sensitive and  <dig> ttc sensitive . the  <dig> deletion strains most sensitive to both don and ttc are listed in table  <dig> . a previous study  <cit>  identified  <dig> strains sensitive to ttc with  <dig> overlapping strains reported here . the overlap of identified strains is significant . many of the mutants found in both studies have also been isolated in many different screens  <cit> . in order to focus on genes involved specifically in toxin response we marked the notoriously isolated multidrug sensitive mutants in our analysis . these belong to the ccr4-not complex , cytoskeleton and endocytosis , vacuole , the cell wall integrity pathway , ure <dig> encoding a prion, the sterol desaturase encoded by erg <dig> affecting membrane permeability, the chromatin remodelling complex subunit snf <dig>  as well as a number of other genes .table  <dig> selected deletion strains sensitive to both ttc and don

to isolate the resistance promoting processes we functionally categorized the genes . assuming that ttc and don are primarily targeting the yeast cytoplasmic ribosome in a very similar if not identical mode of action, we supposed that a cumulative functional analysis of the obtained genes might be useful. gene ontology  annotation of all  <dig> identified genes as well as the  <dig> most sensitive mutants using the  <dig> non-essential genes as background set  yielded a few significant go terms. these are including the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase complex and transcription from rna polymerase i and ii promoter. because of the few significant go terms we manually categorized the identified genes according to their cellular function into the major aspects chromatin metabolism and transcription, amino acid synthesis, cell wall, mitochondrial functions, ion metabolism, protein folding and transport, and rna metabolism  . overall the proportion of don and ttc sensitive mutants in these groups is very similar, indicating that both drugs have a similar effect on yeast physiology. among the  <dig> mutants most sensitive to ttc and don, 60 % of the respective genes are involved in transcription and translation .fig.  <dig> analysis of the don and ttc sensitive mutants. a categorization of  <dig> mutants and their representation within the don and ttc groups. b percentage of functional categories in the  <dig> most sensitive strains. strains are listed in additional file 16: table s <dig> and supplementary data files. c assay plate of the verification plate of the ttc sensitive mutant library strains

fig.  <dig> the genetic interaction networks of genes responsive to don and ttc exhibits properties that make them significantly different from random networks. all three panels show the same network, keeping the same structure and node layout but varying the colouring in order to highlight different biological properties. in the “functional classification” panel, nodes with the same colour share similar biological properties. in the “don” and “ttc” panel different shades of blue and green depict a response to either of the toxins, with stronger colours indicating a more pronounced response



network analysis of genetic interactions
to approach the basic processes encoded in such an assembly of genes with highly diverse functions we analysed their genetic interactions. molecular functions are driven by the collaboration of genes usually represented in functional groups or pathways. to understand what these interactions are and how they are governed is a key question. one way of obtaining this information is to screen for genetic interactions, which underlie a large number of biological functions  <cit> . a network covering the genome-wide set of genetic interaction in yeast has been constructed  <cit> , and allows for screening of interactions and clustered groups of interacting genes. building upon this genetic interaction information we inferred four networks representing either a response to ttc, to don, to either of these two  or both of them . to this end we used the corresponding set of genes as seeds and inferred the corresponding network from the list of genetic interactions. the resulting networks are provided as cytoscape file . at first we inspected the global clustering coefficient, which indicates the presence of local clusters within the networks that might encode for specific functionality. we found that yeast genetic interaction networks of don or ttc responsive genes were more clustered than random networks . this was also observed for the network of ttc or don responsive genes. the shortest path between a pair of nodes is the minimal number of edges between them. shorter path length might render networks more efficient at processing information than networks with another topology. this means essentially that a common connecting process exists in such a network. it has been suggested that small shortest path lengths might facilitate efficient communication between transcription factor genes  <cit> . the three networks  showed a significantly shorter average path length then their random counterparts . the large global clustering coefficient and the short path length present typical properties of small world networks  <cit> . for the network diameter no such clear pattern was observed. an alternative approach for quantifying the network complexity based on topological properties is to make use of entropy-based network descriptors  <cit> . we made use of a parametric graph entropy measure  which assigns a probability value to each node of a graph based on information functionals distributions  <cit> . these information functionals capture the structural information of a graph by considering a given probability distributions  <cit> . for don, ttc, don or ttc networks the distance measure of the sphere-based information functional distributions  <cit>  was found to be significantly different from random networks . this observation supports the idea that the toxin-responsive networks exhibit notable properties which render them efficient at processing information and thus collectively mediate resistance. in contrast to the topology of the don, ttc, and don or ttc  networks, the network of don and ttc  responsive genes was not significantly different from random networks with the same number of seed genes. genes representing the intersection of don and ttc responsive genes might just represent indirect and pleiotropic effects of the respective mutants. one of the main functional clusters present in the intersection network  was the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase complex , involved in transcriptional regulation.

chromatin remodelling complexes are involved in don/ttc resistance
the network analysis points out a hdac and a few other highly contributing genes but also shows a tight interaction over all isolated genes. thus a common theme is likely embedded in the ensemble of the isolated genes. in the following we argue that most mutants impair directly or indirectly the regulation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis or the production and maintenance of functional ribosomes. we concentrate the discussion on groups of mutants that are highly sensitive and the respective gene products are involved in the same pathway or in the same protein complex. in the group comprising mutants in chromatin metabolism and transcription, we identified several subunits  of the rpd3l histone deacetylase complex and rco <dig> of the rpd3s complex. the histone deacetylase rpd <dig> is involved in repression of rna pol ii driven rrna synthesis in stationary phase  <cit> . moreover, loss of the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase, in rpd <dig> mutants or in mutants lacking sin <dig> or sap <dig>  results in a delay in rrna processing but not in an rrna transcriptional defect. genetic evidence also points to rrna posttranscriptional modification as a bottleneck in ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . this suggests that in rpd <dig> mutants, de novo production of ribosomes might be reduced, a defect which may become more pronounced in don and ttc treated cells due to additional inhibition of ribosomes. alternatively, the lack of suppression of intragenic spurious transcription by the rco <dig> mutant  might generate a burden by overloading rna surveillance mechanisms  <cit> . furthermore, we identified three subunits of the swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex . swi/snf has been reported to play a role in transcription by rna pol i in yeast. a  <dig> -fold reduction in rrna synthesis rate was reported for snf6Δ cells  <cit> . moreover, swi/snf is required for repression of rna polymerase ii-dependent transcription in the ribosomal dna  and telomeric silencing  <cit> . thus reduced or aberrantly regulated rrna synthesis in these and other loci  might be one underlying reason for the increased don sensitivity. furthermore, we detected don sensitivity in mutants lacking the histone deacetylases hda <dig> or hda <dig>  and the alternative h2a histone h2a.z encoded by htz <dig>  their influence is unclear apart from the fact that basal transcription of ribosomal genes is repressed in the corresponding mutants. another mutant in a gene with chromatin related function was the hmg protein nhp6a which is recruiting the fact complex  and other chromatin remodelling complexes. nhp6a is required for transcriptional initiation of trna genes and assembly of the rna polymerase ii and iii pre-initiation complexes. notably, also the ccr4-not complex has been reported to be directly involved in rrna synthesis  <cit> .

mitochondria are probably not a direct target of don and ttc
mitochondria have been implicated in the toxic effect of ttc  <cit> . genes connected to mitochondrial functions identified in this study do not seem to highlight a specific metabolic activity of mitochondria or mitochondrial translation. the relatively few mutants related to mitochondrial function  and their low sensitivity does not support a model with mitochondria as major targets for both don and ttc. the most sensitive mutant was lacking mdm <dig> a mitochondrial inner membrane protein required for normal mitochondrial morphology and inheritance. mdm <dig> is upstream of pno <dig> an essential gene required for 18s rrna processing. interference of the knock out cassette with pno <dig> expression under screening conditions cannot be excluded. the possibility remains that pdr5-dependent drug efflux clears the cytosol of don/ttc but not the mitochondrial matrix and is thus pronouncing effects connected to mitochondria as observed by other studies  <cit> .

cell integrity and cytoskeleton are indirectly involved in don/ttc resistance
a substantial number of don/ttc sensitive mutants were involved in cell integrity and cell wall biosynthesis. we identified several members of the protein kinase c  signalling pathway. these are bck <dig> , slt <dig> , zeo <dig> a regulator in the peripheral plasma membrane, and slg <dig> a sensor-transducer. these mutants are multidrug sensitive  <cit>  and appear to be involved in many diverse processes such as regulating maintenance of cell wall integrity, cell cycle, mitophagy and pexophagy and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. for example, slt <dig> plays a role in vacuole homeostasis and actin dynamics  <cit> . in addition to the multifaceted pathology of these mutants, the cell integrity pathway is also involved in repression of ribosome and trna synthesis in secretion-defective cells  <cit> . in addition, we found mutants affecting cell wall integrity or functionality like  <dig> -beta-d-glucan synthase fks <dig> or the alpha 1– <dig> mannosyltransferases anp <dig> and hoc <dig>  anp <dig> has been identified as conferring stress resistance in several instances  <cit> . cell wall synthesis is necessarily coupled to growth which in turn is dependent on biosynthesis. alternatively, the yeast cell wall could have a protective role through drug adsorption properties. yeast cell walls are sold as feed adjuvant with trichothecene protective activity  <cit> . β-glucan, is used to adsorbe don  <cit>  and low but significant adsorption properties have been reported  <cit> . mutants impairing the function of the cytoskeleton are multi drug hypersensitive  <cit>  and were found here to be highly sensitive to both don and ttc. their relative hypersensitivity score   <cit>  is listed accordingly . we identified the interacting actin-associated proteins rvs <dig> and rvs <dig> which have roles in endo- and exocytosis. other sensitive mutants include fimbrin , verprolin  a proline-rich actin-associated protein involved in cytoskeletal organization and cytokinesis, and sla <dig> required for assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. pbs <dig>  the mapkk of the high osmolarity glycerol  pathway has also a function in restructuration of the cytoskeleton  <cit> . a possible reason why such mutants appear in many screens is the observation that rrna levels are repressed in various mutants with defects in transport and exocytosis  <cit> . the unfolded protein pathway is apparently not prominently involved in ttc resistance. the ire <dig> mutant was weakly sensitive to ttc and not to don. protein phosphatase  <dig>  is an enzyme clearly important for resistance against don since we identified three genes belonging to pp <dig> interactors . the catalytic subunit of pp <dig>  is an essential gene and therefore not included in the collection and functions to promote cell integrity, mitosis, bud morphology and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. thus pp <dig> might indirectly have a profound influence on ribosome synthesis.

many mutants impair ribosome and ribosome quality control constituents
genes functionally related to translation comprised several categories: ribosomal subunits , ribosome assembly , the cop <dig> signalosome components , initiation  and rna turnover. furthermore, we identified genes involved in rna degradation such as lsm <dig>  the ski complex , and slh <dig> , and mrna decapping , and splicing . interstingly, bud morphology defects can partially be attributed to impaired ribosome function. a screen for abnormal bud morphology  <cit>  detected  <dig> mutants including  <dig> genes  here identified as don and/or ttc sensitive. these include functions in translation , cell wall  and cytoskeleton . furthermore, don and/or ttc sensitive mutants with defects in trna synthesis and processing involved uridine thiolation of cytoplasmic trnas , a non-canonical poly polymerase which catalyses polyadenylation of hypo modified trnas, snorna and rrna precursors , and a zinc-finger protein stp <dig> possibly involved in pre-trna splicing. an interesting connection to possible oxidative stress caused by trichothecenes is the thioredoxin peroxidase tsa <dig> which acts as ribosome-associated antioxidant  <cit> . however, other genes with dedicated antioxidant functions were not found. biotransformation of trichothecenes occurs partially through glutathione addition  <cit> . a prominent influence on don/ttc detoxification by formation of glutathione conjugates in yeast is not supported by our data. an exception is the prion encoded by ure <dig>  which can mutate to a glutathione transferase but it is involved in growth related processes as well and thus the effect of the mutant might be rather indirect.

the mutant strain with the most striking sensitivity against don was lacking hel2/ydr266c. hel <dig> is an e <dig> ligase and has been linked genetically with the e <dig> ubc <dig>  hel <dig> has initially been implicated in histone turnover  <cit>  and connected to translation and ribosome quality control   <cit> . genetic data identified hel <dig> as a high-copy-number suppressor of an allele of mpe <dig>  a conserved subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor   <cit> . hel <dig> and asc <dig> are factors for polypeptide quality control upstream of rqc  <cit> . this is in line with the action of don and ttc on early stages of translation. the rqc complex  is a ribosome-bound complex required for the degradation of polypeptides arising from stalled translation  <cit> . we tested mutants lacking rqc <dig> and rkr <dig> and found no indication for increased don or ttc sensitivity. paromomycin is an aminoglycoside inducing the ribosome to bypass premature termination codons and to relax the stringency of decoding  <cit> . to investigate if don/tcc toxicity is suppressed in the presence of paromomycin we determined the maximal growth rate in presence or absence of don  and a range of paromomycin concentrations . we find a more than additive growth inhibition of the drug combination on pdr5Δ cells. interestingly, we noted a higher resistance of the hel2Δ strain to higher doses  of paromomycin . thus don-induced stalling of ribosomes is not efficiently released by paromomycin-induced relaxation.

we confirmed the phenotype of the hel <dig> deletion mutant by re-testing the original deletion strain of the ordered strain collection  and by deleting the hel <dig> gene in a different strain background. for confirmation, we used a strain not related to the library strain and because of the low toxicity of don lacking abc transporters  as well as the yeast acetyl transferase ayt <dig>  <cit> . the serial dilution tests showed a clear sensitivity of the respective hel <dig> deletion mutants to don and ttc. since resolving of stalled ribosomes is an activity occurring also in unperturbed cells we expected that the hel <dig> gene overexpressed under the control of the adh <dig> promoter might improve the ribosome clearing capacity. indeed, overexpression of hel <dig> conferred a slight growth advantage in presence of don in the growth test . growth assays using different don concentrations  showed a marked dose-dependent decrease of growth of the mutant but also a gain of resistance by overexpression of hel <dig>  this gain is detectable in the wild type and the complemented hel2Δ strain . thus hel <dig> becomes limiting in don treated cells. also the maximal growth rate was found to be reduced in the don treated strain relative to the wild type .fig.  <dig> deletion of hel <dig> confers hypersensitivity to ttc and don. a spot assay of the confirmed hel2Δ deletion strain in the wild type by <dig> strain background. b spot assay of the hel2Δ deletion in a drug hypersensitive strain background . c growth assay of the yzgn <dig> and yzgn1hel2Δ strains in presence of an hel <dig> overexpressing plasmid and the vector control. d determination of growth rate of don treated yzgn <dig> and yzgn1hel2Δ. e the absence of asc <dig> expression causes ttc hypersensitivity but not the intron encoded snrna



asc <dig>  a homolog of human rack <dig>  and hel <dig> have been implicated in translation through polybasic peptide sequences, and may act after the ribosome has translated some distance  <cit> . asc <dig>  a core component of the small  ribosomal subunit which prevents frameshifting of stalled ribosomes at repeats of cga codons is related in its effective function to hel <dig>  <cit> . translation of cga codon repeats is inefficient, resulting in dose-dependent stalling of ribosomes  <cit> . in this respect it is interesting to note the ttc sensitivity of some mutants defective in arginine biosynthesis  as well as membrane transporters for cationic amino acids . these mutants could decrease the arginine pools and thus lower the availability of the rare trna-arg. also several methionine biosynthesis genes were identified . the asc <dig> gene contains an intron harbouring a snorna transcript unit . to distinguish between asc <dig> and snorna dependent phenotypes we tested a mutant expressing the snorna u <dig> but not asc1p due to a truncation of the first exon  <cit>  and found no effect from the u <dig> rna . thus the strong don and ttc sensitivity of the mutant is due to the absence of asc <dig>  asc <dig> is also required for general cell wall integrity and mutants are hypersensitive to iron starvation  <cit> . in that respect it is interesting to note that we detected genes involved in iron metabolism , as well as, a high-affinity copper transporter of the plasma membrane  and arr <dig> a transcriptional activator involved in resistance to arsenic compounds. the rsp <dig> e3-ubiquitin ligase is involved in endocytosis, membrane protein trafficking and protein quality control and thus indirectly in many cellular processes but notably also in amino acid permease sorting  <cit> . rsp <dig> is an essential gene and is therefore not present in the mutant collection but genes of two interacting proteins were identified. bul <dig> coding for a component of the rsp5p e3-ubiquitin ligase complex and rup <dig> coding for a protein that regulates ubiquitination of rsp5p. taken together, we suspect that many of the isolated mutants ultimately influence cytoplasmic translation and thus cause synthetic phenotypes in the presence of don and ttc.

transcription profiling reveals demand for ribosomes and histones in don treated cells
gene expression pattern analysis is a powerful method to detect transcriptional responses and to deduce active signalling pathways in a given situation. here we investigated whether specific intracellular responses are elicited by don. we used 12 mg/l and 24 mg/l of don which caused a slight growth delay and treated exponentially growing cells lacking pdr <dig>  don was added when the cultures reached od <dig> of  <dig>  and cells were harvested when the cultures reached an od <dig> of  <dig> or  <dig>  and compared to untreated control cultures at the same optical density. to define the difference between short term and long term responses, we incubated cells with 24 mg/l don overnight and re-grew them in fresh medium containing 24 mg/l don to early exponential phase . all measurements were done in triplicate. expression data were filtered and  <dig> genes were selected according to fold change values of above  <dig>  or below− <dig>   in at least one condition and analysed for go term enrichment. we found enrichment of genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and amino acid biosynthesis, however, the distribution is almost even between the induced and repressed genes . notably, the selected genes do not represent a specific cellular response. the gene lists and go analysis are provided as supplementary data . we further analysed the absolute changes of signal abundance to define those transcripts which undergo the largest quantitative changes. the obtained expression level differences were normalized and arranged by hierarchical clustering . significantly enriched go terms connected to expression level differences revealed reduction of genes of glycolysis and amino acid biosynthesis and increase of genes involved in cytoplasmic translation. interestingly, in this selection the levels of most ribosomal protein genes and all histone genes increased. furthermore, expression level differences increase for most ribosomal protein genes . this possibly points to a situation caused by don where translation is lacking behind the available carbon and energy sources. reduced biomass production demand due to restricted growth leads to reduced glycolytic flux and a switch to respiration as energy source.fig.  <dig> microarray analysis of don treated cells reveals both induced and repressed mitochondrial related genes and induced amino acid biosynthesis genes. genes with the largest increase of transcript level  are connected to cytoplasmic translation and ribosome synthesis whereas glycolysis and amino acid biosynthesis genes are repressed. clustering of normalized and filtered expression values including enriched go terms is indicated. a fold change values and b expression level differences. c expression differences and fold change of  <dig> ribosomal protein genes



many deletion strains sensitive to don and ttc are sensitive to many other drugs as well  <cit> . notorious multidrug sensitive strains have defects in functions of vacuole, cytoskeleton and cell wall. these mutants lead to a reduction of rrna synthesis since growth and ribosome synthesis is tightly coupled  <cit> . one common response to environmental perturbations is the delay of the cell cycle progression. for example, various environmental stress types trigger depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton and cause a delay of the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. on the other hand, mutations or drugs that specifically impair actin organization also trigger a g <dig> delay  <cit> . many mutants with defects in various intracellular processes lead to a delay of g <dig>  both delay of the cell cycle and environmental stress lead to a characteristic gene expression pattern designated "slow growth signature"  <cit> . this transcript pattern is characterized by reduced expression of genes involved in protein synthesis such as ribosomal protein genes and glycolysis and the increase of transcripts of genes connected to respiratory growth. we collected the available microarray data for our don and ttc sensitive mutants  <cit>  and aligned the normalized don treatment expression data . the gene lists and values generating the heat maps are provided as supplementary data . we note a high proportion of strains exhibiting the slow growth signature  amongst our sensitive mutants suggesting that many mutant strains are suppressing ribosome production without treatment. exposure to don possibly leads to further reduced availability of translation capacity in these mutants due to degradation and stalling of translating ribosomes. cti <dig>  pde <dig>  ykr023w, vac <dig>  urm <dig>  ire <dig>  apq <dig>  nth <dig>  ure <dig>  vhr <dig>  and rtg <dig> have the inverse transcript pattern . the comparison of the transcript profiles of don-treated cells to the compendium pattern shows a slow growth signature for the early time points and a switch to the inverse pattern at later time points and during chronic exposure . taken together this implies a reduced ribosome synthesis rate in many mutants which might be exacerbated by don induced stalling during translation.fig.  <dig> comparative transcription pattern analysis. a the microarray expression pattern of don and ttc sensitive mutants highlights a slow growth expression pattern in many strains. b don treated cells have an initial dose dependent slow growth expression pattern  which is inverted  at later time points. expression values of the genes of the don treatment are sorted in parallel to the heat map of the microarray compendium depicted below. expression values were obtained from http://deleteome.holstegelab.nl/




CONCLUSIONS
yeast loss of function mutants isolated here as don or ttc sensitive collectively point to cytoplasmic translation, ribosomal efficiency and rrna synthesis as rate limiting for fitness in the presence of these toxins. transcriptome analysis of don treated cells shows an increase of the transcript level of many genes encoding ribosomal protein genes and histones. this perhaps suggests that cells are preparing to enhance biosynthesis. the connector between these observations is the fact that regulation of ribosome synthesis is closely tied to regulation of cell growth rate. synthesis of ribosomes requires a substantial proportion of the cellular biosynthetic activity. for example, synthesis of rrna by rna polymerase i is the major transcriptional activity of the cell, accounting for 60 % of total transcription in rapidly growing yeast cells to allow for the production of ribosomes in rapidly growing cells  <cit> . yeast cells are optimizing their growth corresponding to available nutrients  <cit> . don and ttc treatment is impairing the 80s ribosome and thus reducing the biosynthetic capacity of yeast cells. in this respect, our observation of increased levels of transcripts coding for ribosomal genes and histones makes sense from a yeast perspective. relatively lower translation fidelity in presence of don or ttc would call for increased synthesis of ribosomes to provide the appropriate biosynthetic capacity to utilize the available nutrients. our result that overexpression of hel <dig> increased resistance to don is suggesting that ribosome fidelity is a primary bottle neck of fitness. asc <dig> and hel <dig> are both involved in ribosome quality control and facilitate co-translational protein ubiquitination, translation termination and possibly rna cleavage  <cit> . mutants in genes functioning at later stages of ribosome quality control such as rkr <dig> and rqc <dig> deletion mutants were not sensitive to ttc and don suggesting that asc1/hel <dig> is sufficient to resolve the don/ttc induced translation problem. network analysis of the isolated mutants indicates a tight network, containing the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase complex, centred on core intracellular processes. the overall genetic interaction networks of don or ttc sensitive strains allowed the conclusion that a common mechanism is involved. we believe this is a cytoplasmic mechanism. earlier work suggested a primarily mitochondrial component of trichothecene toxicity. microarray analysis of yeast exposed to t <dig> toxin showed induced oxidative stress and indications point to an effect on mitochondria  <cit> . similarly, a critical role of mitochondria for ttc toxicity was shown  <cit> . our data do not support an effect of don and ttc on mitochondria. this may be partly rooted in the absence of pdr <dig>  the efflux pump might reduce the cytoplasmic pool of toxin but mitochondria might trap a substantial amount. thus, in the pdr <dig> mutant the cytoplasmic concentration might be higher and lead preferably to inhibition of cytoplasmic ribosomes. further differences to published microarrays are also most probably treatment related  <cit> .

the perturbation of growth promoting activities leads in many cases to reduced synthesis of components of the translation machinery  <cit> . many mutants isolated here evoke a growth delay  <cit>  also caused by adverse external parameters and many types of internal malfunctions. the pattern characterizes a reduction of ribosome synthesis and glycolysis. it is tempting to speculate that the tendency of many mutants to reduce cytoplasmic translation is exacerbated by additional inhibition by the trichothecene toxins. the response mechanisms of higher eukaryotes cells are of course much more complicated  <cit> . our results might provide a useful background of functional genomics to contrast against and to highlight specific responses of plant and animal cells. a recent gene expression study of don treated wheat demonstrated induction of amino acid biosynthesis genes and the expression of an e <dig> ligase in response to fusarium  <cit> . transcriptome analysis of ttc-induced expression in barley identified specific responses including ubiquitination related protein genes  <cit> . notably, we identify the e <dig> ligase hel <dig> involved in early translational quality control as possible functional analogue of the wheat fhb <dig> qtl. moreover, hel <dig> was also picked in the previous screen for ttc sensitive strains  <cit> . thus our study pinpoints cytoplasmic translation as the primary target of don and ttc and we therefore suggest mechanisms enhancing translation or recovery of stalled ribosomes as main source of trichothecene resistance.
