BACKGROUND
tumor development, progression, and prognosis remain at the front position of medical research. two hypotheses of the origin of cancer have existed for many decades. one hypothesis postulates that adult stem or precursor cell is the cell of origin for cancer, whereas the other declares a somatic cell can be mutated and then be dedifferentiated or be reprogrammed to regain properties associated with both cancer cells and stem cells  <cit> . the discovery of a subpopulation of tumor stem cells  in leukemia and solid cancers has strengthened the stem cell hypothesis  <cit> . glioblastomas also possess characters and gene expression patterns of local neural stem cells   <cit> , and artificially introducing cancer-associated mutations into stem or lineage-restricted precursor cells can indeed turn them into cancer initiating cells and all mice received mutations developed medulloblastomas  <cit> . another example that the adult stem cell represents the cell of origin of cancer has recently been made in chronic myeloid leukemia : by restricting bcr-ablp <dig> expression to mouse sca <dig> hematopoietic stem cells, it is sufficient to induce cml formation that recapitulates the human disease  <cit> . these evidences support the idea that mutations of stem cells may initiate the carcinogenic process of certain, although not necessary all, tumors.

on the other hand, the importance of somatic or tumor cell mutation and dedifferentiation has not been excluded completely. it has been recognized that during malignant transformation, cancer cells acquire genetic mutations that override the normal mechanisms controlling cellular proliferation. human tumor cells can be created from healthy somatic cells with defined genetic elements  <cit> . even though cancers were originated from mutated stem cells, newly acquired mutations in tumors still contribute in cell malignancy and therapy resistance. it has been recognized that cancer cells acquire characters reminiscent of those of normal stem cells. clinically cancer cells with poor differentiated pathological grading usually have worse therapy response than those with well differentiated morphology. the degree of embryonic gene re-expression correlates with pivotal tumor features and patient prognosis  <cit> . it is known that colon cancers adopt a broad program encompassing embryonic colon development  <cit> . in poorly differentiated breast cancer, gliomas and bladder carcinoma, an embryonic stem cell -like gene expression signature is exhibited and the degree of esc program recapitulation correlates with tumor stages and patient survival  <cit> . recent studies demonstrated that snail, a potent oncogene which can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition , contributes to the acquisition of stem cell traits in breast cancer cells  <cit> . pre-existing cancerous lesions may become more malignant by the accumulation of new oncogenic mutations  that can induce cell dedifferentiation. identifying genes shared between transformed cells, especially the more malignant ones, and stem cells will help to unmask the pathogenesis of tumors, as well as provide us with novel therapeutic targets and prognosis biomarkers.

endometrial carcinoma of the female genital tract can be divided into two forms: endometrial endometrioid carcinoma  which account for 70-80% of cases and are estrogen-related; whereas the type ii tumors  account for 20% of cases unrelated to estrogen stimulation  <cit> . clinically endometrial carcinoma is classified into  <dig> figo stages by the degree of invasion and metastasis: stage i tumors are limit to the uterine body and stage ii tumors extend to the uterine cervix. both stages are considered as less invasive, although stage iib cases are characterized by a less favorable prognosis. in contrast, tumors of stages iii-iv are invasive: for stage iii there is regional tumor spread and for stage iv there is bulky pelvic disease or distant spread  <cit> . approximately 72% of endometrial carcinomas are stage i, 12% are stage ii, 13% are stage iii, and 3% are stage iv  <cit> . the survival rate is also low in patients with higher stages of tumors: 80-90% in stage i, 70-80% in stage ii, 40-60% in stage iii, and 20% in stage iv  <cit> . identifying genes abundant in late eecs can not only unmask the mechanisms of tumor malignancy but also provide us with novel therapeutic targets. recently lgr5- or cd133-positive crypt stem cells of the intestinal track were identified and these cells were proven to be one of the original cells of intestinal cancer  <cit> . olfm <dig> is also a new, robust marker for stem cells in human intestine and marks a subset of colorectal cancer cells  <cit> . disruption of beta-catenin in cells positive for cd <dig> resulted in a gross disruption of crypt architecture and a disproportionate expansion of cd <dig> cells at the crypt base  <cit> . it is unclear, however, whether genes high expressed in epithelial stem cells  also contribute in tumor invasiveness, malignancy and therapy resistance. a broad description of stem cell traits reminiscent in eecs is therefore crucial.

in this study we dealt with the molecular bases of endometrial cancer and assessed the expression of epithelial precursor genes in advanced eec. to examine the shared genes between episc and late eecs, we first need to unmask the gene compositions in different stages of eecs. for this purpose we applied gene expression microarray and machine learning algorithms to filtrate genes differentially expressed in early  and late  eecs. after obtaining genes unique in eecs of different stages, we then related transcriptional programs in episcs and late eecs. this approach helped to discover a total of  <dig> probe sets differentiating eecs of different stages, and, moreover, showed late eecs possess a clear episc gene expression pattern, partly explaining why these tumors are more malignant and fatal.

RESULTS
molecular signatures of early and late stage eecs
to identify epithelial stem cell genes in late eecs, we first delineated early  and late  eecs at the genomics level. we explored genes differentially expressed between early and late eec tissues using the affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  array. the demographics of patients in the training and testing cohorts are in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. tumor samples were compared to each other to minimize stromal and myometrial contamination as well as female-specific genes. a multidimensional scaling  plot using the whole transcriptome showed that the mrna profiles of normal and cancerous tissues are different . we then searched for genes distinguishing early and late eecs according to a statistical pipeline we used  <cit> . a total of  <dig> probe sets could differentiate early and late stage samples, as well as discriminate  <dig> normal endometrium and  <dig> tumor tissues  cutoff q values are shown).

endometrioid: endometrioid carcinoma

*: hepatic metastasis

**: lymph node metastasis

$: isolated from ovary

@: isolated from abdominal wall fascia

mix: mixed endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma

the discrimination ability of these  <dig> probe sets were evaluated by a supervised machine learning strategy, which combines the weighted voting algorithm and leave-one-out cross validation   <cit> . an error rate of  <dig> %  was found . however, we found the top  <dig> features  is the largest panel to have better discrimination ability than that of the 678-probeset signature :  <dig> out of  <dig> early eec tissues are classified into the late group while all  <dig> late ones are correct . mds analysis supports the superior classification power of these  <dig> probe sets: only  <dig> early samples express late eecs gene signatures and are grouped together with the late cases . when applying these  <dig> probe sets on another independent testing data set containing  <dig> early eec cases,  <dig> out of  <dig> early tissues  is misgrouped .

in-depth exploration of eec-related genes
to have a better idea how the filtrated genes distribute in early and late eecs, a gene expression heat map for those  <dig> probe sets was drawn . this heat map showed the unique gene expression patterns between early or late eec tumor tissues. consistent with the classification data obtained by prediction strength  analysis in figure 1d, hierarchical clustering showed that only  <dig> early cases in the training data set are misclassified .

those  <dig> probe sets correspond to  <dig> known genes  and  <dig> cdnas, which have no gene symbols been assigned yet . among them  <dig> genes/cdnas are predominantly up in early eccs while  <dig> being down . in contrast,  <dig> genes/cdnas are particularly high in late eecs while another  <dig> being low . the details of known genes  are in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. many of these genes, such as cd <dig>  <cit> , msr <dig>   <cit> , erbb <dig> oncogene   <cit> , csta   <cit>  and ccr <dig>  <cit> , have been associated with tumor malignancy and poor patient outcomes in eec or other cancers . cd <dig> and msr <dig>  are markers for m <dig> macrophages, whose infiltration in tumor lesions is correlated with the histological grade of the gliomas  <cit>  . these consistent findings support the reliability of our gene lists. we also validated our array data by performing immunohistochemical staining on taiwanese eec cases. erbb <dig> was indeed more abundant in stages iii and iv eec tissues .

to gain more insights into the functional consequences of differential gene expression, we performed gene set enrichment analysis for the filtrated genes. signature probe sets were subjected into the gene ontology  database search to find statistically over-represented functional groups within these genes. the biological processes being statistically overrepresented  in late stage-enriched genes are shown in table  <dig>  these predominant processes include those pertaining to immune system process, second-messenger-mediated signaling  are bold), map kinase activity  are bold), membrane organization and biogenesis, regulation of catalytic activity  are bold), and cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction are significantly up .

for genes enriched in early eecs, cdkn2a  tumor suppressor was found to be reverse correlated with eec prognosis  <cit>  . another tumor suppressor is apba <dig>  precursor protein-binding, family a, member 2; also known as mint2), which is frequently methylated and silent in colorectal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma  <cit> . hypermethylation of gpr <dig> is also frequently found in acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> . in terms of oncogenes, robo <dig> , a receptor of the slit <dig> axon guidance and cell migration growth factor, is associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer  <cit> . esco <dig>  is tightly correlated with brca1-dependent and various cell-type specific carcinogenesis  <cit> , and dapp <dig> pluripotent factor is enriched in seminomas  <cit> . vangl <dig>  acts as an executor in colon cancer cells with regard to cell motility and thereby controls cell invasion, which may contribute to promoting metastasis  <cit> . the abundant expression of known oncogenes in early eecs also suggests the early eec cases contain high percentage of epithelial tumor cells instead of merely stromal and myometrial contaminations.

a six-gene signature distinguishing early and late eecs
when evaluating the classification effect of filtrated genes, we noticed that the top  <dig> genes could already distinguish early and late eecs, and these  <dig> genes gave the same diagnostic power to that of the  <dig> probe sets in the training cohort . the same two early cases  were misgrouped with the late ones . when applying these  <dig> genes on the testing data set, a lowest error rate could also be achieved . only  <dig> out of  <dig> early tissues  was misgrouped . the same stage 1b sample was misclassified when either applied only these  <dig> genes or the entire  <dig> probe sets . thus, these  <dig> genes hold clinical potentials of being diagnostic biomarkers. these  <dig> genes are:  atp-binding cassette, b ,  <dig>   archaemetzincins- <dig>   amyloid beta  precursor protein-binding a <dig>   lim domain only  <dig>   hypothetical protein loc <dig>  and  homo sapiens mrna, clone image: <dig>  . amz and apba <dig> are up-regulated in early eecs. abcb <dig>  loc <dig> and cdna flj <dig> fis are down in tumors, especially in late eecs, while lmo <dig> particularly down in early eecs.

re-activation of epithelial stem cell genes in advanced eecs
since our main goal is to identify episc genes in eecs, we compared the gene expression profiles of eec tissues of all  <dig> stages to that of normal cd133+ episcs  <cit> . when the  <dig> genes distinguishing early and late eecs were applied to compare the relationships between eecs and episcs, clearly episcs have a closest relationship to late eecs . this impression is strengthened by calculating the average linkage distances between sample groups. compared with early eecs, eec of both stages iii and iv are closer to episcs to a similar extent , suggesting the re-expression of episc features in late eecs. a total of  <dig> episc genes are overexpressed in advanced eecs . also, genes down-regulated in late eecs  are absence in episcs . most early eecs clustered together and expressed the intermediate level of episc genes , consistent with the distances analysis result in figure 5b.

discussion
eec still ranks one of the most fatal female cancers worldwide and disease progression very often accompany with worse clinical outcomes and treatment failure. identifying genes or canonical pathways associated with advanced cancer can help to unmask the mechanisms of tumor malignancy as well as provide us with novel drug targets. it has been recognized clinically that cancer cells, especially the advanced and metastatic ones, possess characters reminiscent of those of normal stem cells. the degree of stem cell gene expression correlates with pivotal tumor features and patient prognosis  <cit> . hence, identifying shared genes between late eecs and stem cells will provide new insights into cancer biology, as well as new prognosis markers and therapeutic targets. in this study, we identified a 217-probeset signature which could distinguish late  from early  eecs . more low stage disease array data than high stage ones were obtained, which may partly due to the fact that the early diagnosis takes place in almost 90% of eec clinically. we combined primary and metastatic late eec samples in one group since their molecular profiles are indistinguishable . prostate episcs were used as a comparative group since array data for endometrial stem cells is not available yet. nevertheless, prostate cd133+ cells are still epithelial stem cells and therefore good controls. other episc data should reproduce part of our findings.

our results reveal a previously unaware link between genes associated with episc identity and the histopathological traits of eecs. it is possible that these genes contribute to the stem cell-like phenotypes of late eecs. a total of  <dig> episc genes were found overexpressed in late eecs , and genes down-regulated in late eecs  are also absence in episcs . among those  <dig> overexpressed genes there are famous oncogenes or stemness genes . adam <dig> , also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme  or less commonly cd156q, is a therapeutic target in multiple diseases since major contemporary pathologies like cancer, inflammatory and vascular diseases seem to be connected to its cleavage abilities  <cit> . cap <dig>  overexpressed in pancreatic cancers is involved in cancer cell motility  <cit> . capg , gelsolin-like) also contributes in the motility of pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . pdcd <dig>  is involved in cerebral cavernous malformations   <cit>  and is found to interact with ste20-related kinase mst <dig> to promote cell growth and transformation via modulation of the erk pathway  <cit> . psen <dig>  is involved in apoptosis, overexpressed in high-risk patients with stage i non-small cell lung cancer , and is in a prognosis signature of nsclc patients  <cit> . senp <dig>  is highly expressed in trophoblast cells that are required for placentation, and targeted disruption of senp <dig> in mice reveals its essential role in development of all three trophoblast layers via modulating the mdm2-p <dig> pathway  <cit> . the appearance of these known oncogenes or stemness genes in our data supports the reliability of our gene lists. the roles of episc genes in both epithelial stem cell biology and eec malignancy will be addressed further.

several genes were previous suggested to be tumor suppressors. csta , a cysteine proteinases inhibitor, is implicated in preventing local and metastatic tumor spread of cancers. the risk of disease recurrence and disease-related death was thus higher in patients with low csta in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  <cit> . npas <dig>  is a circadian gene as well as a putative tumor suppressor involved in dna damage response  <cit> . phc <dig> , a component of the hprc-h complex, associates with e2f <dig> during g <dig> and is lost in osteosarcoma tumors  <cit> . validating their expression in different stages of eecs by further immunohistochemstry study will not only provide novel malignancy mechanisms but will also present new drug targets.

in the past few years, much effort has been put to explore the mechanisms and additional molecular markers for predicting prognosis of eecs by using high-throughput genomics technology. gene expression microarray  is a popular platform among all of those high-throughput genomics techniques. in this study we applied gem and machine learning algorithms to filtrate out a 217-probeset signature for disease diagnosis. many of the filtrated genes have been linked to tumor progression and malignancy, supporting the reliability of our array data. moreover, we narrowed down this 217-probeset profile to a six-gene mini-signature for the differentiation of early to late eecs in the training set. this signature can be validated by an independent testing cohort . owing to the small gene number of this signature, it is now possible to check their mrna levels in patient tissues by real-time pcr in regular clinical labs. recently a five-gene profile and a five-microrna signature are identified for the prediction of clinical outcomes in non-small-cell lung cancer  <cit> . whether our six-gene signature can be correlated with relapse-free and overall survival among patients with eec is unclear and awaited to be elucidated. also, whether the protein expression levels of these  <dig> genes correlate with those of mrnas is unclear. since most of the patients in either training or testing data set were caucasian , whether this gene signature can be applied in patients with various genetic backgrounds should also be studied.

in our datasets we noticed that few early eec cases expressed already late eec genes and therefore could not be classified correctly . since patients with late and metastatic eec tend to have poor prognosis, whether these unusual early cases possess worse clinical outcomes is an interesting issue. it has been suggested that prognosis potential of human tumors is inherited in early lesions. for example, the gene expression patterns in metastatic colorectal carcinoma are readily distinguishable from those associated with in situ tumors  <cit> . a subset of primary tumors resembled metastatic tumors with respect to this gene-expression signature  <cit> . very recently varmus and colleagues showed that when untransformed mouse mammary cells were introduced into the systemic circulation of a mouse, those cells can bypass transformation at the primary site, form long-term residence in the lungs but do not form ectopic tumors  <cit> . husemann et al. also observed that systemic spread can be an early step in breast cancer. tumor cells can disseminate systemically from earliest epithelial alterations and form and micrometastasis in bone marrow and lungs  <cit> . therefore, release from dormancy of early-disseminated cancer cells may frequently account for metachronous metastasis. the metastatic potential of human tumors is encoded in the bulk of a primary tumor and, at least in a subset of patients, metastatic capability in cancers is an inherent feature. our eec gene signatures therefore hold the potential of being a novel prognosis panel. more advanced therapy and clinical follow-up should be applied on early stage patients with molecular feature similar to that of episc.

in advanced eecs, tumor tissues express more genes abundant in cd133+ episc and acquired a stem cell trait . the expression of these episc genes in late eecs may due to the re-expression of episc features in late stage eecs, i.e., further mutations and stem cell gene reactivation in certain early eecs. the intermediate episc gene expression level in early eecs supports this point . recent studies demonstrated that emt contributes to the acquisition of stem cell traits in cancer cells and the induction of emt inducer snail results in stemness gene expression  <cit> . whether emt also contributes in eec progression and metastasis is an interesting issue to follow. however, we did not rule out the possibility that certain late eecs may arise from an independent rapidly progressing cancer utilizing stemness molecular pathways. according to the tumor stem cell theory, cancer cells may be originated from different cancer stem cells acquiring distinctive oncogenic mutations. certain early eecs have the capacity to progress to late stage disease may due to a mechanism that they arose from the same mutated progenitor cells as late eecs. the observation that several early eec cases express episc genes already  favors the later hypotheses. these  <dig> situations may both exist in vivo, but our profiling work cannot favor any of them yet. nevertheless, genes filtrated here will provide clinicians novel prognosis markers and therapeutic targets.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, here we reveal distinct epithelial stem cell traits and gene expression patterns in late eecs and some of these genes hold the potential of being novel drug targets. drugs targeting map kinase pathway, for example, may be applied for the treatment of late eec since this canonical pathway is significantly up in late eecs . since applying a statistical analysis of gene ontology terms is the reliance on prior knowledge of the biological activity of each differentially expressed gene, the enrichment of genes associated with specific pathways may be a consequence of intense research in such areas. hence, new canonical pathways may still exist and may serve as candidate therapeutic targets. function of the filtrated kiaa  and loc series of anonymous ests  in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> should be studied and their roles in tumor malignancy, chemoresistance and episc stemness are awaited to be elucidated. further studies to prove the prognosis values and therapeutic potentials of the identified genes, especially those also present in epithelial stem cells, should lead to a better understanding of eec and episc biology and the susceptibilities of late eecs to treatment.
