BACKGROUND
the anoctamin  proteins represent a novel family of membrane proteins with  <dig> members  in mammals  <cit> . some members are over-expressed in various cancers and diseases  <cit> . anoctamins are highly hydrophobic proteins with eight transmembrane domains  and one re-entry loop  <cit> . anoctamin proteins have tissue-specific patterns of expression  <cit> . although electrophysiological and biochemical studies in both native and heterologous expression systems provided important clues to understanding the function of anoctamin membrane proteins, the biological roles have been elucidated for only a few members of this family  <cit> . ano <dig> functions as a ca2+-activated cl- channel in a broad range of tissues, and it can be activated by cell swelling  <cit> . ano <dig> expression is confined to the photoreceptor synaptic terminals in retina and the olfactory sensory neurons where it functions as a ca2+-activated cl- channel  <cit> . ano <dig> and ano <dig> can also induce cl- conductance when over expressed in frt cells  <cit> , although the function of these proteins is not clear. however, it seems that not all anoctamin proteins operate as ca2+-activated cl- channels, since ano <dig> and ano <dig> inhibited anion conductance produced by ano <dig>  <cit> . so far no functional data exist for ano <dig> and ano <dig>  phylogenetic analysis suggests that anoctamin proteins descended from common ancestor and that ano <dig> and ano <dig> form a functional subfamily  <cit> . to gain more insight into the phylogeny and molecular evolution of the anoctamin gene family comprehensive bioinformatics study was performed. this has also led us to predict the structural and putative functional motifs, moreover a number of critical amino acid sites that may be of importance for the functional divergence in the anoctamin protein family have been identified.

RESULTS
origin and evolution of the anoctamin gene family
we first retrieved the available anoctamin sequences from the currently sequenced genomes. querying major databases and unfinished genomes with the full-length amino acid sequences from the ten human anoctamin paralogues  identified  <dig> homologous proteins in vertebrates, urochordates, cephalochordates, echinodermates and invertebrates . incomplete and redundant sequences were discarded and initial data set included  <dig> sequences. to explore the phylogenetic relationship among anoctamin paralogues, we constructed an unrooted maximum-likelihood  phylogenetic tree according to the best fit model  predicted using prottest program  <cit>  for the  <dig> anoctamin genes from  <dig> species .

while vertebrates have  <dig> paralogs, most other organisms contain three or four anoctamin family members. echinodermates  and the recently sequenced amphioxus genome, which represents the best pre-duplicative set of the vertebrate genome  <cit>  contains only one copy of the anoctamin gene, strongly suggesting that gene duplication events have occurred in the lineage leading to the vertebrates. in each of the urochordata genomes, ciona inestinalis and ciona savigny, the closest relatives of the craniates, we identified three anoctamin sequences. thus, gene duplication of the anoctamin family appeared to have occurred very early at the base of the chordates tree. the vertebrate anoctamins form ten separate monophyletic groups, indicating that the formation of the paralogous subfamilies occurred before the divergence of individual species . the phylogenetic branches of anoctamins  <dig> and  <dig> separated considerably earlier in evolution than other anoctamin subgroups. the high level of sequence identity within a subfamily suggests evolutionarily conserved functions. invertebrate genomes on the other hand contain distinctly fewer anoctamin paralogs, and it seems that their number increases with evolutionary complexity. different number of anoctamin paralogs in invertebrates suggests complex evolutionary history. overall, the data indicate that both, large scale  and small-scale duplications contributed to the evolution of the anoctamin subfamilies, which is in good agreement with previous findings demonstrating that large-scale gene duplications have occurred during chordate evolution  <cit> .

membrane topology of the vertebrate anoctamins
for the analysis of the membrane topology we focused on vertebrate anoctamins. multiple amino acid sequence alignment of  <dig> vertebrate anoctamins  was used to predict putative transmembrane domains  and hydrophobic regions. hydropathy plotting of  <dig> anoctamins revealed eight transmembrane domains including one re-entry loop . these eight hydrophobic peaks are strongly conserved in the vertebrate anoctamins suggesting membrane insertion of all anoctamin family members, similar to anoctamin  <dig>  these results are in agreement with topological study of ano <dig>  <cit> .

evolution of the protein domains in the anoctamin family
anoctamin protein sequences were scanned for the presence of protein domains and functional sequence patterns with interproscan and smart servers . all anoctamins have at least one consensus n-glycosylation site, located in the extracellular loop between tmd <dig> and tmd <dig>  ano  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have a unique protein-protein interaction pdz domains, although pdz domain sequence in ano  <dig> and ano  <dig> is conserved only in mammals, and all anoctamins except ano  <dig> and ano  <dig> have at least one putative coiled-coil domain. a putative cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate binding domain   <cit>  which consists of a stretch of  <dig> amino acids containing α-helix and conserved amino acid residues located between tmd  <dig> and  <dig>  is present in all anoctamins but ano  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, it appears that c-nmp binding domain evolved after splitting of ano  <dig> and  <dig> from the other anoctamin paralogs.

analysis of functional divergence
gene duplication provide a means to evolve novel biological functions and changes in protein functions may then provide different evolutionary constraints on duplicated genes. functional divergence of a protein family can occur after major evolutionary events such as gene duplication or speciation. some of them result in different evolutionary rates at certain amino acid residues, which is termed type i functional divergence  <cit> . to estimate functional divergence in the vertebrate anoctamin family, we have conducted pair-wise functional divergence analysis between anoctamin paralogous genes using diverge  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the coefficient of functional divergence  of pair-wise comparisons between the members of the anoctamin family. all comparisons showed θ >  <dig> with p <  <dig> , suggesting that a site-specific rate shift after gene duplication is a common phenomenon in the evolution of the anoctamin family. further analysis was subsequently focused on ano1/ano <dig>  and ano1/ano <dig>  amino acids residues responsible for functional divergence after gene duplication were identified using site-specific profiles  in combination with suitable cut-off-values derived from the posterior probability of each comparison. residues predicted to be functionally divergent in anoctamins were mapped onto topology model of human anoctamin  <dig> . the predicted functional sites are not equally distributed throughout the respective anoctamin, but instead are clustered at the n-terminus, and in the hydrophilic loops between predicted transmembrane domains . despite the high global sequence identity of mammalian anoctamins  <dig> and  <dig>  functionally divergent amino acids were also identified between these anoctamins. this amino acid residues which are predominantly located in the loop regions exposed to soluble ligands could be responsible for the different unitary conductance and kinetics between ano <dig> and ano  <dig>  <cit> . finally, functional divergence within the anoctamin paralogues demonstrates that the anoctamin family members have evolved different functional properties after gene duplication and phylogenetic diversification events  <cit> . although all anoctamins have similar membrane topology and show sequence conservation in the regions located around tmd's and the re-entrant loop, it is not clear whether all members of the anoctamin family are associated with cl- currents in various tissues. according to the result of our study, it is possible that they represent different types of ion channels, which can be activated by other types of physiological stimuli. this study also demonstrates that amino acids critical for functional divergence are predominantly located in the loop regions exposed to soluble ligands. functional improvements which include pseudogene formation  <cit> , subfunctionalization  <cit>  and neofunctionlization  <cit>  after gene duplication may result in altered functional constraints between members of a gene family. in this study, the divergences of amino acid sequences among different subfamilies provided us with indication that the anoctamin genes may have diverse physiological functions. the results of type i functional divergence  suggested that anoctamin genes should be significantly functionally divergent from each other, owing to the evolutionary rate and/or property differences at some amino acid sites. hence, functional divergence perhaps reflects the existence of long-term selective pressure.

selective pressure among amino acid sites in the anoctamin family
in order to test for presence of positive selection at individual amino acid codons, the site specific models implemented in codeml program  <cit>  were used. likelhood rate tests were performed between model m <dig>  and m <dig>  on anoctamin sequences, however no positively selected sites were detected. this can be explained with strong purifying selection which acts on majority of the protein, while a few sites undergo positive selection. therefore substitution rate ratios on non-synonymous  versus synonymous  mutations  were calculated for vertebrate anoctamins, as shown for anoctamin  <dig> . the ratios calculated between members of anoctamin family were much less then  <dig>  such as  <dig>  for anoctamin  <dig>  indicating strong negative selection. interestingly, sites under strong purifying selection are located predominantly in the tmds  suggesting their importance for the function of the anoctamin proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the anoctamin protein family suggests that both large-scale and small-scale gene duplications and purifying selection are the primary evolutionary force for generating the anoctamin family. evolutionary analysis supports the hypothesis from electrophysiological studies that anoctamins have evolved distinctive functional properties, which have occurred after gene duplication. these findings will provide new insights for the structural evolution study of anoctamin gene family and possibly will offer a starting point for further experimental verifications.
