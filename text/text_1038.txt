BACKGROUND
vascular cambium is a cylindrical secondary meristem that produces both secondary phloem and secondary xylem . the most characteristic components of secondary cell walls are lignins, complex phenolic polymers, which play fundamental roles in mechanical support, water and solute conductive properties and disease resistance in higher plants  <cit> . the biosynthesis of the lignin polymers derives from the general phenylpropanoid pathway which provides precursors for several branch pathways leading to the elaboration of a wide range of compounds involved in various aspects of plant development and defence  <cit> . in the lignin-specific branch pathway, the conversion of hydroxycinnamoyl coa esters into cinnamyl alcohols , the monomeric units that are incorporated into the lignin heteropolymer, is catalyzed by cinnamoyl coa reductase  and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  successively.

the spatial and temporal expression of the eucalyptus gunnii ccr and cad <dig> genes was investigated by fusing the gene promoters to the uida reporter gene coding for Î²-glucuronidase  and expressing these constructs in transgenic woody and herbaceous plants  <cit> . both egcad <dig> and egccr gene promoters have been reported to direct gus activity in the vascular tissues of all organs in all the plant species examined. similar expression patterns have been reported for the arabidopsis thaliana atcad-c and atcad-d genes, which encode proteins that are closely related to the egcad <dig> enzyme  <cit> . the gus activities were found to be consistent with tissue and cell locations of the ccr and cad <dig> transcripts and proteins obtained by the use of in situ hybridization and immunolocalization  <cit> . these observations showed that the two genes have the same expression pattern, suggesting that the control of monolignol production is, at least in part, achieved through their coordinated transcriptional regulation.

deletion studies of the egccr and egcad <dig> promoters showed that the egccr promoter deleted to - <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site retained its ability to direct gus expression in a pattern similar to that obtained with the full-length promoter whereas the promoter deleted to - <dig> bp was inactive  <cit> . in the egcad <dig> promoter, a region necessary for gus expression in cambium and secondary xylem was mapped between - <dig> and - <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site  <cit> . these results indicate that expression of the egccr and egcad <dig> genes is under the control of a promoter region  proximal to the transcription start site. as revealed by in silico studies, both regulatory regions contain putative binding sites for myb transcription factors.

plant myb proteins belong to one of the largest families of transcription factors. according to their predicted sequences and structural features, they have been classified into several subgroups  <cit> . the r2r <dig> two-repeat myb family occurs specifically in plant lineages and its members have been postulated to participate in the regulation of a wide range of developmental and metabolic processes, notably the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . however, despite the conservation of myb consensus motifs  in most phenylpropanoid gene promoters, functional evidence for their contribution to the promoter activity has only been directly proven for a few of them . although the involvement of myb proteins in the monolignol-specific branch pathway has been suggested , the functional role of myb cis-elements and the molecular mechanism by which they participate in promoter activities have not yet been investigated.

the main goal of this study was to define the functional role of putative cis-elements in the transcriptional activities of egcad <dig> and egccr promoters. firstly, we restricted the regulatory region of the egcad <dig> promoter to an  <dig> bp region necessary for expression both in secondary xylem and in cambium. this  <dig> bp region contains two myb sites and two unreferenced sites that are revealed by in vivo footprinting. a straightforward approach to investigate the functional role of promoter elements is to introduce block mutations into the putative cis-elements in the context of the shortest active promoter. thus, by using egccr and egcad <dig> short promoter versions carrying single or combined mutations in their putative cis-elements, we clearly identified the myb elements in the egccr and egcad <dig> promoters as being crucial not only for the formation of protein-dna complexes in vitro either with recombinant myb protein or with cellular protein extracts, but also for the transcriptional regulation of egccr and egcad <dig> genes in planta. in addition, the experimental data showed that a newly identified cis-element is required for egcad <dig> expression in the cambial zone.

RESULTS
an  <dig> bp egcad <dig> cis-regulatory region is involved in egcad <dig> expression in xylem tissues and in dividing cells
to further localize the cis-elements in the  <dig> bp region  involved in the transcriptional regulation of egcad <dig>  <cit> , we introduced several truncated versions of the promoter fused to the gus reporter gene into tobacco by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. tobacco, a model herbaceous plant which undergoes secondary thickening, was previously shown to be a suitable model plant for studying the egcad <dig> promoter from trees  <cit>  and also phenylpropanoid promoters from herbaceous or woody plants . the shortest tested 5'-deletion showing a similar vascular expression pattern to the full-length  promoter was deletion - <dig> . stem cross-sections showed gus expression in cells connected to lignification, such as differentiating xylem and parenchyma cells of the primary and secondary xylem , but also in cells apparently unconcerned by lignification, such as the dividing cells of the vascular cambium and the cells of the external and internal phloems, especially the companion cells . gus expression in xylem and cambium was lost upon deletion of the promoter to - <dig> which retained gus activity only in the internal phloem of tobacco stem  <cit> , delimiting a shorter  regulatory region  involved in promoter activity in xylem and vascular cambium.

to confirm the importance of this  <dig> bp region in egcad <dig> expression in dividing cells, we transformed tobacco by <dig> suspension-cultured cells with the - <dig> promoter deletion construct. fluorimetric measurements of gus activity indicated that this short promoter was active in by <dig> cells at a level close to that of the egcad <dig> full-length promoter or of the constitutive camv 35s promoter used as a reference . gus activity decreased drastically with the - <dig> promoter deletion construct . these data confirm that the  region contains cis-elements required for activity of the promoter in dividing cells  as well as in xylem.

fine mapping of cis-elements in the egcad <dig> promoter by in vivo dms footprinting
to precisely map the cis-elements in the egcad <dig> promoter interacting with trans-acting factors, we used in vivo dimethyl sulphate  footprinting, a technique allowing location of protein-dna interactions with single nucleotide resolution  <cit> . the chemical agent dms methylates the unprotected guanine residues rendering them susceptible to cleavage by piperidine.

the footprints were examined over a broad region  encompassing the regulatory region . in exponentially-dividing cells that highly expressed egcad <dig> , several guanine residues of the promoter sequence showed differences in the footprint relative to the control , whereas in stationary phase cells with low expression of egcad <dig>  the footprint was almost identical to the control . the protected  or hypersensitive  sites, corresponding to lower or higher intensity bands respectively relative to the control, are indicated on the promoter sequence . two protected areas were identified, each composed of two adjacent guanines , surrounded by hypersensitive residues . hypersensitivity to dms methylation can indeed result from alterations in the local dna topology induced by protein binding  <cit> . the protected guanines fall within two identical sequences , which we call bsa  and bsb , and which have no homology with consensus binding sequences in databases. just downstream of both bsa and bsb, however, are sequences that correspond to mbsiig, one of the plant myb transcription factor binding sites tggt;  <cit> ). these elements are named myba  and mybb . all the footprints are included within the  <dig> bp regulatory region delineated above. no other footprint was observed within the investigated  broad promoter region , indicating the absence of additional interaction sites upstream and downstream of the  <dig> bp regulatory region.

when surveying the cad <dig> regulatory region in several eucalyptus species, a few base substitutions were found in bsa and bsb sequences whereas the myb sites were perfectly conserved, arguing for their possible functional importance . it is worthy of note that similar conservation across eucalyptus species was also found for the unique myb site in the ccr regulatory region .

these results suggest that four relatively close putative cis-elements in the regulatory region  of the egcad <dig> promoter could interact with several transcription factors in cells that are transcriptionnally active for the egcad <dig> gene.

effect of mutations on in vitro and in vivo binding of egmyb <dig> to the egcad <dig> and egccr promoters
to investigate the ability of myb sites of egcad <dig> and egccr promoters to interact in vitro and in vivo with myb factor, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to disrupt these putative regulatory sites individually or in combination. electrophoretic mobility gel assays  and transactivation experiments were carried out in the presence of the eucalyptus protein egmyb <dig>  a r2r <dig> myb factor, that was hypothesized to positively regulate the transcription of genes belonging to the monolignol pathway  <cit> .

emsas were performed using recombinant egmyb <dig> and dna probes corresponding to  egcad <dig> and  egccr regulatory fragments with mutated myb sites . the specificity of the dna-protein complex was verified by competition with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabelled specific competitor  whereas an unlabelled non-specific dna  did not affect the formation of the complexes. mutation of the myba and mybb sites in egcad <dig> and mutation of the myb site in egccr abolished the binding of recombinant egmyb <dig> to the regulatory fragments. this loss of binding occurred even when a single myb site remained intact in the egcad <dig> promoter, indicating that both myb sites are required for maximal binding of egmyb <dig> 

transactivation experiments were performed by co-transfecting both the egmyb <dig> cdna expressed under the control of the camv 35s promoter  and wild-type or mutated - <dig> egcad <dig> or - <dig> egccr promoters-gus fusions  into leaf mesophyll cells . when the wild-type - <dig> egcad <dig> promoter was co-transfected with the egmyb <dig> construct, gus activity was induced  <dig> -fold when compared to the control construct . interestingly, the endogenous activity of the myba-mutated promoter was notably higher than that of the wild-type promoter, suggesting that the myba element might bind a repressor, at least in leaf mesophyll cells. single or combined mutations of the myba and mybb elements reduced the gus expression driven by egmyb <dig> to the same level as their respective controls, thereby reflecting the loss of activation by egmyb <dig>  again, this effect was observed even with a single mutated myb site, indicating that both myb sites are required for transactivation of the egcad <dig> promoter by egmyb <dig>  transactivation of the - <dig> egccr wild-type promoter by egmyb <dig> by about 2-fold was also abolished upon mutation of the myb site .

together, these in vitro and in vivo data indicate that, in the experimental conditions used, the three myb cis-elements are able to directly interact with egmyb <dig> transcription factor and are involved in the transcriptional activation of egcad <dig> and egccr genes mediated by egmyb <dig> 

effect of mutations in cis-elements on the protein binding activities of the egcad <dig> and egccr regulatory regions
to investigate the role of myb and bs putative cis-elements of egcad <dig> and egccr promoters in the binding of transcription factors to the regulatory regions, emsas were performed using the regulatory fragments carrying several combinations of block mutations and tobacco protein extracts . for both wild-type promoter fragments, a large fast-migrating band was observed and another slower-migrating complex  was also detected when the protein extracts were used immediately after extraction . the large band was composed of two closely migrating complexes already described for egccr  and named l <dig> and l <dig> for egcad <dig> 

competition with a 100-fold molar excess of the corresponding unlabelled specific competitor dna fragments blocked the formation of all the complexes  whereas a similar amount of an unlabelled non-specific dna had no effect , indicating the specificity of the interactions.

whereas mutation of the myba site in egcad <dig> had no major effect on the emsa result , mutation of the mybb site prevented the formation of both the slower migrating complex  and the lowest part of the faster migrating large band  . single or double mutations in the bs elements of egcad <dig> somewhat perturbed the pattern of the complexes with a notable decrease in h and a concomitant increase in l <dig> , especially when bsb was mutated . this concomitant increase in l <dig> was lost with the additional mutation in mybb . thus, when combined mutations including mybb were tested , similar results were obtained as with the mutation of mybb alone, ie loss of the h and l <dig> complexes. taken together, these data suggest that mybb is a key cis-element involved in the formation of the h and l <dig> complexes and that bsb, and to a lesser extent bsa, apparently influence the ratio between the h and l <dig> complexes. concerning the egccr promoter, only the mutation of the myb element led to an overall decrease in all the complexes .

effect of mutations in cis-elements on vascular expression of egcad <dig> and egccr promoters
to investigate the role of each cis-element on tissue-specific expression from egcad <dig> and egccr promoters, transgenic tobacco plants expressing gus under the control of the wild-type or mutated - <dig> egcad <dig> or - <dig> bp egccr promoters were generated.

the bsa- or myba-mutated egcad <dig> promoters  drove a gus expression pattern similar to the wild-type - <dig> egcad <dig> promoter . in contrast, mutation of mybb resulted in a considerable global diminution of gus staining in all vascular tissues, suggesting that mybb could be bound by an activator factor . this decrease in gus staining was particularly pronounced in the xylem rays and in the parenchyma cells surrounding the primary xylem. although with a lower intensity, the cambial-phloem zone still appeared as a continuous ring like with the wild-type promoter . this gus expression pattern was also observed with the myba-mybb double mutant , confirming that myba does not play a crucial role in the promoter activity under these experimental conditions.

upon mutation of the bsb cis-element, a substantial decrease in gus activity was observed in the vascular cambium and, to a lesser extent, in the immediately derived parenchymatous cells, ie the xylem rays on the inner side and the parenchyma cells between phloem islands on the outer side . thus, the cambial-phloem zone resulted in a spotted pattern with the spots showing gus activity restricted to the external phloem area. the internal phloem still displayed gus staining .

the double mutation bsb-mybb reflected the combined actions of the single mutations with an overall reduction of gus activity.

gus activity driven by the wild-type - <dig> egccr promoter construct showed a vascular pattern similar to that driven by the - <dig> egcad <dig> promoter and to that reported in  <cit>  using the full-length egccr promoter . this staining pattern was not affected by mutation of the bs <dig> cis-element. in contrast, gus activity in plants carrying the single myb mutant construct or the bs1-myb double mutant construct notably diminished in all vascular tissues. as already observed for egcad <dig>  gus expression remained evident in the internal phloem of stem .

these observations were further corroborated by fluorimetric measurement of gus activities . egcad <dig> mybb and bsb single mutants showed a strong reduction of gus activity  when compared to the wild-type - <dig> promoter. similarly, mutation of the myb site in the egccr promoter resulted in a marked decrease of gus activity  when compared to the wild-type - <dig> promoter .

taken together, these data provide evidence for a functional module comprising bsb-mybb in the egcad <dig> promoter: mybb appears to bind a general activator factor in all cell types whereas bsb might bind a protein specific to the cambium dividing cells. in the egccr promoter, the unique myb cis-element might fulfil these dual functions.

discussion
contribution of the egcad <dig> and egccr cis-elements to the protein binding and to transcriptional activities of the promoters
here, we delineated a short regulatory region  in the egcad <dig> promoter which is required for expression both in xylem tissues and in dividing undifferentiated cells either cultivated in vitro or already present in planta embedded within other tissues such as the cambial cells. four cis-elements potentially involved in the regulation of egcad <dig> expression were identified within this region. they are arranged in two modules, each comprising an identical repeat of an unreferenced protein binding site  with the sequence ctggtt and an mbsiig consensus site for myb proteins. a simpler organisation exists in the  regulatory region of the egccr promoter with two putative cis-elements: a g-rich box  and a mbsiig myb consensus site  <cit> .

our results with emsas and transgenic plants with mutated cis-elements revealed the importance of the mybb cis-element in egcad <dig> and of the myb cis-element in egccr for the formation of the high and low mobility complexes and for the transcriptional activation of the egcad <dig> and egccr promoters in vascular tissues.

it is intriguing that neither emsas nor the transgenic plant approaches provided clear evidence of a functional role for myba in egcad <dig> promoter activity. this does not exclude its participation in other promoter functions, such as the response to external stimuli  <cit> , or mechanisms specific to woody plant species  <cit> , or expression in other parts of the plant, as does, for example, the aciii/myb element of the bean pal <dig> promoter, which drives expression specifically in flowers  <cit> . moreover, our observation in transactivation assays that the endogenous activity of the myba-mutated promoter in the absence of egmyb <dig> was notably higher than the wild-type promoter activity, suggests that the myba element might bind a repressor, at least in leaf mesophyll, a tissue where egcad <dig> and egccr promoters are poorly expressed. such repressors of lignin biosynthesis genes have already been demonstrated in the myb family; some of them have broad tissue expression patterns whereas others are tissue-specific or are preferentially expressed in particular tissues  <cit> .

mutation of the bsa site in the egcad <dig> promoter or of the g-rich bs <dig> site in the egccr promoter had no major effect on complex formation in vitro or on promoter activity in transgenic plants. in contrast, mutation of bsb in egcad <dig> drastically reduced the formation of the h complex in emsas and altered the expression pattern in transgenic plants, leading to decreased promoter activity in cambial cells and in the immediately derived parenchyma cells.

ongoing studies show that the proteins of the slow-migrating h complex are found in the phosphorylated fraction of tobacco nucleus proteins whereas those of the faster-migrating l <dig> complex are found in the unphosphorylated one . we believe that the h and l <dig> complexes which both bind the mybb element of egcad <dig> could differ from each other by the addition of one or more protein which can be subjected to phosphorylation. bsb that is located close to mybb in egcad <dig> could be involved in the formation of the phosphorylated complexes since its disruption affects the ratio between h and l <dig>  the possible involvement of the bsb site both in phosphorylated transcriptional complexes and in egcad <dig> expression in cambial cells  is consistent with the crucial and widely known role of phosphorylation mechanisms in metabolism connected to cell division  <cit> .

the similar protein binding activities of the egcad <dig> and egccr regulatory fragments in emsas and the similar expression patterns driven by the promoters in vascular tissues suggest that the transcriptional mechanisms necessary for their coordinated expression may be mediated by their common myb cis-elements.

functional architecture of the promoters
the complex organisation of the egcad <dig> promoter with its cis-elements arranged in two similar modules  suggests that redundancy and mechanisms of cooperation or competition between cis-elements and trans-acting factors might be involved in the regulation of the promoter activity. in particular, emsas with recombinant egmyb <dig> and transactivation assays clearly demonstrated that the two myb sites of the egcad <dig> promoter cooperated for binding and activation. when studying in silico the distribution of myb sites in the proximal  <dig> bp of the arabidopsis phenylpropanoid gene promoters , it appears that two copies of myb elements and, more specifically, mbsiig or mbsii sites  are found in most promoters, generally separated by  <dig> to  <dig> bp . although the ccr gene involved in lignin biosynthesis in arabidopsis follows this rule, intriguingly the promoter of the ccr gene in eucalyptus contains a single myb element . the two nearby mbsiig of bean pal <dig> and pal <dig> genes  were demonstrated to be crucial for the transcriptional regulation of these genes in planta  <cit> , suggesting a functional significance for this promoter architecture. furthermore, as in our study, cooperative binding was also reported for the two myb elements of the bean pal <dig> promoter in the presence of the pine ptmyb <dig> protein  <cit> .

combinatorial interactions between the transcription factors binding to myb elements and those binding to other closely located cis-elements are crucial for transcriptional regulation of the flavonoid branch pathway genes  <cit> . other putative cis-elements that could cooperate with myb elements were detected in the regulatory regions of egcad <dig> and egccr by using the place database . gt- <dig> elements, putative targets for trihelix-related transcription factors  <cit> , appear to be well conserved in the regulatory regions of cad <dig> and ccr in various eucalyptus species . interestingly, the hypersensitive site at - <dig> revealed in this study by in vivo footprinting falls within a wrky transcription factor binding site  <cit>  that is conserved in the cad <dig> regulatory regions; however it is more variable in ccr, especially in the invariant core which is essential for wrky protein binding. in addition, the cad <dig> regulatory region contains a conserved motif similar to the tere cis-element that is involved in secondary wall formation during differentiation of tracheary elements  <cit> ; this motif is, however, not found in the egccr regulatory region. presently, we cannot exclude the involvement of these putative cis-elements in cad or ccr expression. however, the strong conservation of the myb elements together with their key role in promoter activity, as demonstrated in this paper, indicates that the coordinated developmental regulation of egcad <dig> and egccr expression is mediated through myb transcription factors.

myb candidates for transcriptional regulation of egcad <dig> and egccr genes
egcad <dig> and egccr genes which, as demonstrated in this study, required functional myb binding sites in their promoters, exhibit expression in cell types consistent with their function in monolignol biosynthesis. their expression was indeed found  in xylem tissues undergoing lignification and in parenchyma cells surrounding and feeding the lignified tissues with monolignols and  in the vascular cambium in which small monolignol oligomers may be components of a signal transduction pathway leading to the cell division  <cit> .

myb transcription factors responsible for egcad <dig> and egccr transcriptional activation should be found in the cell types exhibiting cad <dig> and ccr expression and the interplay between various myb factors or other transcription factors might contribute to the spatio-temporal expression patterns of egcad <dig> and egccr genes within specific cell types.

particular myb transcription factors have been detected in the cambium  <cit>  and in xylem rays  <cit> , and might contribute to egcad <dig> and egccr promoter activities in such parenchymatous tissues. other myb factors appear more specifically expressed in relation to secondary wall formation in cells that synthesize lignins. the eucalyptus egmyb <dig> and the pine  ptmyb <dig> and ptmyb <dig> transcription factors are preferentially expressed in secondary xylem. when overexpressed, these transcription factors affect the expression of monolignol biosynthesis genes and the amount or composition of lignins  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the transcriptional network regulating secondary wall synthesis has been investigated  <cit> . atmyb <dig>  a close homologue of egmyb <dig> and ptmyb <dig>  appears to be a key switch in mediating the biosynthesis of the three major components of secondary walls  through the control of downstream, pathway-specific myb and other transcription factors  <cit> . recently, other arabidopsis myb factors, more closely related to ptmyb <dig>  were shown to directly regulate the promoters of lignin biosynthesis genes  <cit> . at the present time, the role of egmyb <dig> in the regulation of egcad <dig> and egccr gene expression must be clarified in order to determine whether egmyb <dig> activates the transcription of these genes by direct binding on their promoters in vivo or by an upstream control as suggested for atmyb <dig> 

a complex picture of the transcriptional regulatory network controlling lignin biosynthesis genes is therefore emerging, with various myb factors acting at different levels. as in the flavonoid branch pathway  <cit> , the myb factors controlling the monolignol pathway are likely to cooperate within multiprotein complexes with other protein partners that remain to be characterised.

CONCLUSIONS
the overall goal of this project was to characterize the functional role of putative cis-elements from promoters of genes involved in the monolignol biosynthetic pathway. in this study, we first demonstrated that the myb cis-elements found in the delineated regulatory regions of egcad <dig> and egccr promoters are able to be bound by myb factors to form specific dna-protein complexes in vitro. myb cis-elements play a key role in the vascular expression of these two genes and support the hypothesis that myb elements serve as a common means for the coordinated regulation of genes in the entire lignin biosynthetic pathway. moreover, a novel functional cis-element was identified and shown to be involved, possibly in combination with the myb cis-element, in the transcriptional regulation of egcad <dig> in cambial cells. a comprehensive understanding of the functional cis-elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of egcad <dig> and egccr is the first step to dissect the regulatory network controlling lignin biosynthesis. future studies will aim at the identification of the transcription factors that bind these cis-elements and at the mechanisms by which these transcription factors interplay with each other to provide the final spatio-temporal regulation of the lignin pathway.
