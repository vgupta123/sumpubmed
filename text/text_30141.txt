BACKGROUND
alkaline phosphatase  is a ubiquitous enzyme widely distributed from microorganisms to humans  <cit>  and functions to catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of phosphate monoesters under alkaline conditions, releasing inorganic phosphate from many phosphate-containing compounds. this enzyme plays important roles in microbial ecology through its involvement in phosphate metabolism  <cit> , signal transduction  <cit> , and bacterial virulence  <cit> . among bacterial aps, escherichia coli phoa, which encodes an ap , has been most extensively studied. ecap is a homodimeric enzyme requiring two zn2+ ions and one mg2+ per monomer  <cit> , and its active site has a conserved serine residue that is phosphorylated through catalysis  <cit> . phoa-like aps are found in many other bacteria and have conserved domains with those in ecap  <cit> . recently, the novel ap genes phox and phok were identified in vibrio cholerae  <cit>  and sphingomonas sp. strain bsar- <dig>  <cit> , respectively; these genes were shown to be activated by ca2+ and share no homology with phoa.

ap is also a key enzyme in many molecular biology techniques, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  <cit> , western blots, and immunodetection assays  <cit> . the favorable properties of ap for these applications are high catalytic activity and thermal instability, which allows simple inactivation by heat treatment  <cit> . thus, several thermolabile aps have been isolated and characterized from psychrophilic microorganisms such as the antarctic strain tab <dig>  <cit> , the marine bacterium vibrio g15- <dig>  <cit> , and the bacterium shewanella sp. sib <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the ap enzyme from the marine psychrophile sphingomonas sp. strain bsar- <dig>  was found to be very efficient in bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate under alkaline conditions  <cit> .

metagenomes have been successfully used for the discovery of novel biocatalysts and biomolecules for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications  <cit> . to date, no thermolabile aps from metagenomes have been isolated or characterized. this might be due to the limited availability of sensitive and reliable screening systems, which enable the screening of large libraries of metagenome clones  <cit> . recently, we developed a genetic circuit termed the genetic enzyme screening system  that allows for the measurement of enzyme activity as in vivo fluorescence intensity and is highly useful for high-throughput metagenomic screening of enzymes  <cit> . the gess is able to detect the activities of phenol-releasing enzymes, such as esterases/lipases, lyases, cellulases, and phosphatases, which have many applications in biotechnology  <cit> .

here, we report the first isolation and characterization of a novel thermolabile ap from metagenomes using the gess. a metagenomic library was constructed with ocean-tidal flat sediments because they were collected from dynamic physicochemical environments with remarkable microbial diversity. we repeatedly screened approximately  <dig> metagenomic fosmid clones and identified one positive clone that showed significant ap activity. the metagenome-derived ap  was expressed as a soluble form with a high yield in the periplasmic space of e. coli, purified to homogeneity, characterized biochemically, and then applied to the dephosphorylation of linearized plasmid dna.

RESULTS
rationale of the gess method
we previously developed a genetic circuit, gess, for functional screening of phenol-generating enzymes from genomes or metagenomes  <cit> . dmpr from pseudomonas sp. strain cf <dig> acts as a transcriptional activator that can be stimulated upon binding to its effector. it regulates the expression of the divergently transcribed dmp operons, which are involved in phenol degradation, from the po promoter in response to aromatic effector compounds   <cit> . we took advantage of this regulatory system by placing the po promoter upstream of enhanced green fluorescent protein  gene to put egfp expression under the control of dmpr, generating a gess for detection of phenol and its derivatives  <cit> . for functional screening of ap, the dmpr of gess can be activated upon binding to p-nitrophenol , which is released from p-nitrophenyl phosphate  hydrolysis by ap, and then turn on the egfp expression. using this gess, we conducted a systematic screening that allowed the high throughput in vivo detection of ap activity from metagenomes.

isolation of an ap from a metagenome library
a metagenomic library was constructed from dna isolated from ocean-tidal flat sediments and encompassed approximately  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb. this library was screened using pnpp as a substrate to detect ap activity. using the strategy described in the methods section, we discovered six clones exhibiting strong ap activity. further screening resulted in the identification of a single positive fosmid clone, designated pfos144c <dig>  which carried a dna insert of approximately  <dig> kb. after randomly shearing the dna,  <dig> to  <dig> kb fragments were ligated into pstv <dig> and a sublcone designated pstv28-ap <dig> was identified based on fluorescence signals and ap activity. the sequence of this clone was determined . among three intact orfs in pstv28-ap <dig>  an orf of  <dig>  nucleotides encoding a putative ap of  <dig> amino acids, with a deduced molecular mass of  <dig> kda, was found through a blast search. the deduced amino acid sequence of map gene was compared with other protein sequences of aps available from the ncbi database using the blastp program. map exhibited significant homology with the ap superfamily, and the level of sequence identity showed the highest similarity with nucleotide phosphodiesterases from psychrophilic sphingopyxis sp. mc <dig>  and sphingopyxis alaskensis rb <dig> . in addition, this map was also highly similar to aps from sphingobium sp. syk- <dig>  and sphingomonas sp. strain bsar- <dig>   <cit> .figure  <dig>

sequence and phylogenetic analyses of map
a multiple-sequence alignment analysis of map was conducted using aps that showed high similarity with functionally characterized aps . recently, the thr <dig> of spap was found to be the catalytic residue  <cit> ; this residue was conserved as thr <dig> in map. in all other aps, the catalytic residue is a conserved serine ; thus, map was unique in that its catalytic residue was a threonine . the alignment also identified absolute conservation of six residues  of the active site between spap and map. the deduced amino acid sequence of map was then used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree with full-length amino acid sequences of aps from various organisms . four distinct clusters were formed:  the phoa cluster, including aps from e. coli, shrimp , and antarctic bacterial tab <dig> ;  the phox-i cluster containing most marine bacterial aps and the well-characterized sinorhizobium meliloti ap ;  the phod cluster; and  the phox-ii cluster, including functionally and structurally characterized spap, map, and map homologs from psychrophilic marine bacteria. the phox-i and phox-ii are well-defined groups in phox family, mostly along phylogenetic lines  <cit> . phox-i includes a diverse group of α- and γ-proteobacteria while phox-ii includes the gram-positive actinobacteria, most the cyanobacteria and many of the α-proteobacteria encompassing sphingopyxis, sphingobium, and sphingomonas.figure  <dig>

expression and purification of map
to further characterize the map enzyme, the  <dig> -bp map was cloned into the pet-21a plasmid and overexpressed in e. coli bl <dig>  when map was expressed in e. coli cells at 37°c, no protein band with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig> kda was detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . however, when we expressed map at various temperatures , map expression was increased as the temperature was decreased . interestingly, when whole cell extracts from cells expressing map were separated by sds-page, two bands were observed: one band having the calculated molecular mass of  <dig> kda, and the other band having a lower molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda . it is possible that the  <dig> kda band represents the secreted and processed form from which the signal peptide cleaved. in order to test this possibility, the localization of map was examined when it was expressed at 15°c and 20°c. after cellular fractionation of periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins using sucrose osmotic shock, sds-page was conducted. map with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda was detected in the periplasmic fraction only at 15°c , indicating that map was a cold-adapted ap. the his6-tagged map enzyme secreted into the periplasm of e. coli bl <dig> cells was purified using single-step ni-nta affinity chromatography . the purified map enzyme exhibited a high specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg when pnpp was used as the substrate at 37°c. purified map was then used for subsequent biochemical characterization.figure  <dig>

type ii secretion by a putative tat signal peptide
because there was a discrepancy between the calculated  and experimentally determined  molecular mass of map, a bioinformatic survey was carried out to predict the signal sequence of map. the signalp  <dig>  server  <cit>  did not identify any significant signal peptide cleavage sites in the deduced amino acid sequence of map. however, according to tatp  <dig>  server software  <cit> , which can predict the presence and location of twin-arginine translocation  signal peptide cleavage sites in bacteria, the first  <dig> residues of map were predicted to be a tat signal peptide. indeed, n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified 64-kda and 56-kda maps confirmed the first  <dig> amino acids as a signal peptide . the tat signal peptide, which has the consensus motif srrxflk, followed by a membrane-spanning hydrophobic region  <cit> , is a conserved feature among phox proteins  <cit> . based on these results, we concluded that mature map had a length of  <dig> amino acids and a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, in accordance with the expression results of map . in order to determine the molecular mass of map in its native form, map was subjected to size exclusion chromatography. the molecular mass was determined by comparing its elution time with those of standard proteins. one major peak of map appeared when the elution time was  <dig>  min. regression analysis to compare the molecular mass of standard proteins and the elution time indicated that the molecular mass of active map was around  <dig> kda , which suggested that map was monomeric in its native form.figure  <dig>

enzymatic properties of map
next, we investigated the substrate preference of the purified mature map using various substrates. map demonstrated significant phosphatase activity with pnpp and with phosphorylated metabolites including nucleotides and carbohydrates . except for phytic acid and d-glucose 1-phosphate, map dephosphorylated all the tested substrates. while map showed broad substrate specificity, the highest activity was detected with adp, followed by datp, dgtp, and amp. however, map was unable to hydrolyze bis-pnpp, indicating that it did not have phosphodiesterase activity. the previously reported smap also demonstrated significant phosphatase activity with most natural substrates, which cover all major classes of known phosphorylated metabolites  <cit> .table  <dig>

the apparent optimal ph of map was  <dig>  in  <dig> mm diethanolamine  buffer. the enzyme exhibited at least 70% of its optimal activity over a rather narrow ph range, from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and had significant activity over a ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . furthermore, thermal activation studies demonstrated that the apparent optimum temperature was 37°c, and 25% of the maximum activity was found at 60°c . moreover, the enzyme exhibited at least 80% of its optimal activity over a temperature range from 30°c to 40°c, indicating that map was a marine-derived psychrophilic enzyme. thermal stability was determined from enzyme incubation for  <dig> min over a range of temperatures . the psychrophilic map showed remarkable thermal instability, resulting in complete loss of its enzymatic activity, by incubation at 65°c for  <dig> min .figure  <dig>

divalent cations, such as zn2+ and mg2+, have been identified as essential cofactors for ecap  <cit> . the activity of map was completely inhibited by  <dig> mm edta, indicating that it was a metalloenzyme . to examine the metal specificity of map, the enzyme was dialyzed against  <dig> mm tris buffer  containing  <dig> mm edta. the resulting apoenzyme was assayed for phosphatase activity in the presence of various divalent cations . ca2+ was the best metal ion for reconstitution of enzyme activity, followed by co2+ and zn2+, suggesting that map was strongly dependent on multiple divalent cations. mg2+ and cu2+, however, had no significant effect on the restoration of enzymatic activity .table  <dig>

the kinetic parameters of map were estimated using the pnpp as substrate . the km of map is somewhat lower than the km values reported for aap, sap, and calf intestinal ap , but higher than that of smap which is a well-characterized phox. when compared with the km value of ecap, it is almost same . in addition, map exhibited higher turnover number  and catalytic efficiency  than those of ecap, aap, ciap, and smap .table  <dig>

dna dephosphorylation by purified map
ap is widely used in molecular cloning to remove the 5′-terminal phosphate group from dna fragments linearized by restriction enzymes, preventing religation of the linearized dna. thus, we tested the dephosphorylation efficiency ) of map against cohesive  and blunt  ends. the de , which represents the ability of ap to prevent recircularization of linear dna fragments, was estimated by comparing transformation rates after ligation of dephosphorylated and nondephosphorylated puc <dig> plasmids  <cit> . map completely dephosphorylated dna fragments with 3′-protruding cohesive ends generated by hindiii . the des  of map were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for 5′-protruding cohesive ends generated by psti and blunt ends generated by smai, respectively. the de  of map was then compared with that of four different commercial aps . the des  of map for both 3′-protruding cohesive ends and blunt ends were comparable with those of commercial aps, whereas the de  of map for 5′-protruding cohesive ends was slightly lower than the values determined for sap, ciap, and apex heat-labile ap  .table  <dig>

discussion
using the gess and metagenomic library of ocean-tidal flat sediments, we have identified a novel ap, called map, as a new member of the phox family of aps. to the best of our knowledge, this enzyme is the first thermolabile ap with functional activity isolated from a metagenome.

the map presented here clearly shows that it is distinct from the well-studied phoa proteins; the sequence identity between map and phoa family  was very low compared to the identity observed among phoas . based on a phylogenetic analysis, map evolutionarily belongs to the marine bacterial phox family, consistent with its isolation from flat tidal sediments. map and its homologs from the psychrophilic marine bacteria sphingopyxis sp. mc <dig>  sphingopyxis alaskensis rb <dig>  sphingobium sp. syk- <dig>  and sphingomonas sp. strain bsar- <dig> formed a phylogenetically distinct group that did not belong to the phoa family.

 map activity is ca2+-dependent whereas phoa activity requires mg2+ and zn2+. ecap is probably the most well-characterized phoa to date. ecap requires two zn2+ ions to coordinate the phosphomonoester in the active center  <cit> . interestingly, spap requires ca2+ and zn2+ for activation, while mg2+ has no effect  <cit> . phox has a different catalytic center that requires ca2+ instead of zn2+ for enzyme activity  <cit> . similarly, map also required ca2+ for catalytic activity, indicating that its requirement for ca2+ instead of zn2+ has probably been a major factor in its selection over phoa in flat tidal sediments, where zn2+ often occurs at subnanomolar concentrations  <cit> . a recent study of the marine metagenomic global ocean survey database showed that phox is more widely distributed among marine bacteria than phoa  <cit> .

 map is exported via the tat pathway whereas phoa translocation is dependent upon sec pathway  <cit> . in contrast to the sec pathway, the tat secretion system is able to translocate fully folded proteins across bacterial membranes  <cit> . the tat signal peptides are generally longer than sec signal sequences  <cit> . map was found to have n-terminal  <dig> amino acids as a tat signal peptide. the tat signal peptide of map was longer than other previously identified phox family proteins that are ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . in addition, map contained a tat motif  that is slightly different from previously reported tat signal peptides of phox family  <cit> . interestingly, the tat signal peptide of map was working at only low temperature  among all tested temperatures , suggesting that it has been evolved as a cold-adapted ap in ocean-tidal flat sediments with dynamic temperature changes. although spap is also released to extracellular space, its signal peptide is not described yet.

 map exists as a monomeric enzyme while phoa is active in the dimeric state. among characterized phoa family, ecap and spap are present as a homodimer and multimeric protein, respectively.



recently, the crystal structure of spap was reported and revealed that the key catalytic residue in spap is threonine, which is conserved in map, instead of serine found in all other aps  <cit> . in addition, the arginine conserved in key active site of phoas is deleted in spap. based on these unique structural features, spap represents a new class of aps  <cit> . although spap and map are structurally different from other aps, they share several enzymatic properties with typical phoxs, such as high specific activity, low substrate specificity, and thermolability. in addition, both spap and map enzymes require ca2+ for activation and map is secreted through the tat pathway, which are similar to those of other phox proteins  <cit> .

psychrophilic enzymes are frequently associated with longer polypeptide chains compared to their mesophilic counterparts  <cit> ; indeed, this was the case for map in the present study. compared to the majority of the aps in the swissprot database, monomeric immature map was a relatively large protein  composed of  <dig> amino acids. indeed, map exhibited remarkable thermal instability and was completely inactivated by incubation at 65°c for  <dig> min, in contrast to bap, which retained 98% of its original activity at 70°c. in general, remarkable thermal instability, along with higher catalytic efficiencies at low and moderate temperatures, is properties of psychrophilic enzymes  <cit> . therefore, an ap from psychrophiles exhibiting such properties could be of significant biotechnological interest.

aps are used in various molecular biology applications for the dephosphorylation of plasmid dna prior to cloning in order to prevent recircularization, for the dephosphorylation of 5′-nucleic acid termini before 5′-end labeling by polynucleotide kinase, and for the removal of dntps and pyrophosphate from polymerase chain reaction assays. however, the ap has to be carefully removed after dephosphorylation to avoid interference with subsequent steps. furthermore, ecap and ciap, which are preferred enzymes for these applications, are heat-stable and require the addition of detergents for inactivation. thus, thermolabile aps are excellent alternatives as they are inactivated by moderate heat treatment and would therefore allow subsequent steps to be performed in the same test tube while minimizing nucleic acid losses. we examined the de  using a linear cohesive or blunt-ended puc <dig> plasmid and found that des  of map for cohesive and blunt ends were comparable with those of commercial aps. therefore, because map exhibited excellent efficiency in linearized dna dephosphorylation and was inactivated by simple heat treatment, further studies may be focused on elucidation of its potential use in molecular biology applications under optimal conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a novel ap isolated from metagenomes of ocean-tidal flat sediments. the metagenome-derived ap is expected to show high potential for diverse molecular biology applications including the construction of recombinant plasmids. this was corroborated by its detailed biochemical characterization, which revealed high activity, catalytic efficiency, and thermal instability. in addition, the production of this enzyme with high yield in e. coli may be accelerating its applications.
