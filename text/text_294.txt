BACKGROUND
actinosynnema pretiosum is a commercially important organism due to its ability to produce ansamitocin p- <dig> , a potent anti-tumor agent  <cit> . the cytotoxicity of ansamitocin has prompted its use as a toxic "warhead" in immuno-toxin conjugates  <cit> . several of these conjugates are currently in late-phase clinical trials as therapeutic agents against solid tumors  <cit> . thus, there is interest in generating strains of a. pretiosum that produce greater concentrations of ap- <dig> to meet increasing industrial demands, particularly as the yield from wild type a. pretiosum is low   <cit> . previously, a random mutagenesis approach  <cit>  has been used to generate strains which produce 5- to 10-fold more ap- <dig> than the parental strain. recently, deletion of a putative transcriptional repressor, asm <dig>  has also been reported to increase ap- <dig> yield  <cit> .

one method to improve the productivity of a. pretiosum would be to alter the regulation of ansamitocin biosynthesis through genetic manipulation of selected genes. the ap- <dig> biosynthetic genes, identified through comparisons with the amycolatopsis mediterranei rifamycin biosynthetic gene clusters, and gene expression in streptomyces lividans  <cit>  and s. coelicolor  <cit> , revealed the lack of a rifh homologue in a. pretiosum  <cit> . the rifh gene encodes an aminodahp synthase in a. mediterranei and is involved in the synthesis of aminodahp required for the ap- <dig> precursor, 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid . addition of ahba has been shown to increase ap- <dig> production  <cit> . although dahp synthase from the shikimate pathway in a. pretiosum may supply the ahba pathway  <cit> , it is not dedicated to aminodahp synthesis. based on these reports, we hypothesized that a metabolic bottleneck in the synthesis of aminodahp was the limiting factor in ap- <dig> biosynthesis and sought to relieve this bottleneck through heterologous expression of rifh, thus providing an aminodahp synthase for a. pretiosum.

we report the construction of a series of novel expression vectors that allow stable integration of target genes into the a. pretiosum genome. the vectors have components from pset <dig>  <cit> , the is <dig> transposable element  <cit>  and the erme* promoter  <cit> , all of which have never previously been used in a. pretiosum. we have shown functionality of the vectors in e. coli, as the cloning host, and in a. pretiosum, as the transconjugant. we also validated plasmid constitutive expression, reporter function and integration preference, which did not alter host cell density or ap- <dig> levels. finally, we demonstrate the vector's usefulness in heterologous expression of rifh in a. pretiosum and report its effects on ap- <dig> production.

RESULTS
conjugable and integrative pap expression plasmids in a. pretiosum
is <dig> is a well studied transposable element capable of integrating into several streptomyces species  <cit>  and into mycobacterium smegmatis  <cit> . plasmids containing is <dig> had previously been derived from the mini-circle version  <cit> . in this study, is <dig> was derived from a linearized and amplified copy in the streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> chromosome and modified at the ends for integration into the chromosome of a. pretiosum . plasmid containing is <dig> with unmodified ends did not result in a. pretiosum transconjugants. by moving the attm  sequence, cta, and the  <dig> bases upstream of it from the 3' end  to the 5' end , chromosomal integration at the attm site was restored. in this regard, consensus sequences of up to  <dig> nucleotides flanking attm have been identified in the genomes of s. lividans  <cit>  and m. smegmatis  <cit> , suggesting a role in alignment of the integration site. transconjugants of pap <dig> were apramycin resistant and circular plasmids were not detected in a chromosomal dna preparation , which was expected, as the plasmid lacked a streptomyces replicon.

the erme*p is a strong promoter that has been used in streptomyces for protein expression  <cit>  and modulating secondary metabolites production  <cit> , making it useful for this study. three different rbs sequences were tested for efficiency: the unusual rbs sequence of erme   <cit> , an e. coli consensus rbs sequence   <cit> , and a putative rbs sequence found upstream of the a. pretiosum gene, asm <dig>   <cit>  . e. coli clones and transconjugants of pap <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were tested for metapyrocatachase activity, encoded by xyle, with catechol. catechol positive colonies were observed strongly in e. coli clones of pap <dig> and mildly in pap <dig> clones while pap <dig> clones were negative . a. pretiosum transconjugants of pap <dig> turned bright yellow, while transconjugants of pap <dig> and pap <dig> turned slightly yellow and did not change color, respectively . this indicated the e. coli rbs sequence was the most robust, and that the erme* promoter was functional in a. pretiosum. in addition, xyle was a suitable translational reporter in a. pretiosum.

to apply the reporter gene in an expression system, two versions of a translational reporter vector were constructed. transconjugants of pap <dig>  did not result in catechol positive colonies while transconjugants of pap <dig>  were catechol positive and their activities were comparable to transconjugants of pap <dig> .

constitutive expression of rifh in a. pretiosum
to determine whether the erme* promoter enabled constitutive expression of rifh in a. pretiosum, a clone of pap <dig> was grown in shake-flasks and cells were harvested over  <dig> days. quantitation of rifh mrna was normalized against 16s rrna and calculated relative to the first harvest point . the amount of rifh mrna on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not change significantly  .

integration sites, sequences and stability of pap <dig>  pap <dig> and pap <dig> in a. pretiosum
it was important to determine the site of integration of the transconjugants to ensure the integrative vector was not affecting essential genes or genes involved in secondary metabolite production, and subsequently growth or ap- <dig> production. is <dig> transposition integration has not been studied in a. pretiosum. integration frequency was determined by southern hybridization of genomic dna from  <dig> transconjugants to an is <dig> probe . no signal was observed from wild type a. pretiosum , while a single integration event at a specific site was observed in each transconjugant. four specific integration sites  were found from sampling  <dig> transconjugants. the most common was a  while b, c and d each occurred once . the sequences of integrated plasmids and chromosomal junctions were determined by plasmid rescue, which allowed the design of site a, b, c and d specific pcr primers  and amplification of the chromosomal integration sites. comparison of the is <dig> integration sites in a. pretiosum to those in m. smegmatis revealed consensus sequences for a. pretiosum sites a, c and d and m. smegmatis site a, and a. pretiosum site b and m. smegmatis sites b and c . sequence analysis revealed that a. pretiosum site a was within an orf with homology to a putative nadh-flavin reductase of nocardia farcinica ifm  <dig> . sites b, c and d were in intergenic regions, upstream of a putative integral membrane protein of thermobifida fusca yx, downstream of a glutamyl-trna synthetase of nocardia farcinica ifm  <dig>  and upstream of a putative atp-dependent rna helicase of n. farcinica ifm  <dig>  respectively. the pap plasmids did not cause target site duplication upon integration. pcr amplification of chromosomal and plasmid junctions was used to detect tandem insertions, which would result in amplicons of  <dig> bp and >  <dig> kb, or deletions, which would not result in an amplicon. tandem insertions or deletions were not detected in the transconjugants by southern hybridization or pcr .

*restriction sites are underlined

stability of plasmids integrated into sites a, b, c and d of a. pretiosum was determined. after  <dig> duplications under non-selective conditions, cultures representing each of the integration sites had less than 1% plasmid loss.

ap- <dig> production of transconjugants
since the most common site of plasmid integration was within a putative orf, the effect of integration on ap- <dig> production was of interest. mean ap- <dig> yields from wt in ymg obtained on ten different occasions were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l for day  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l for day  <dig>  transconjugants  <dig> to  <dig> of pap <dig>  pap <dig> and pap <dig> having either site a, b, c or d plasmid integrations were assayed for ap- <dig> production in ymg. for pap <dig> transconjugants, site a mutants did not affect ap- <dig> yield over  <dig> days, but the site d mutant had lower ap- <dig> yields, particularly on day  <dig> . all pap <dig> and pap <dig> transconjugants expressing xyle and rifh, respectively, had similar ap- <dig> yield to the wt at the end of the fermentation period . packed cell volume of transconjugants, representing cell growth, was also measured for each ap- <dig> assay and found to be equivalent to that of wt .

discussion
an important factor in expression vectors is a suitable rbs; failure of pap <dig> for xyle expression in e. coli was likely due to host ribosome and rbs incompatibility. the vector with an e. coli consensus rbs sequence  resulted in the strongest expression of xyle, while the putative rbs sequence of a. pretiosum asm <dig>  resulted in weaker expression. hence, while pap <dig> is useful for strong constitutive expression of target genes, pap <dig> may be used if moderate expression is required. to confirm translation of the gene of interest, two versions of a translational reporter vector were made. the pap <dig> rifh-xyle fusion construct  did not produce a functional metapyrocatachase, perhaps due to steric hindrance of the fused protein or the lack of appropriate translational signals for xyle, while the pap <dig> rifh-xyle operon construct with an rbs sequence dedicated to the reporter gene worked well.

for the purposes of this study, it was important that the integrative plasmid did not affect host ap- <dig> production or bacterial growth. hence, plasmid integration sites and their effect on ap- <dig> levels were determined. plasmid integration into site a was most common, while sites b, c and d occurred once in each set of transconjugants containing either pap <dig>  pap <dig> or pap <dig>  since only four transconjugants of each set were screened, it is unlikely these secondary sites are plasmid-dependent. comparison of a. pretiosum integration sites with those of m. smegmatis and hence s. lividans revealed gc-rich consensus recognition sequences flanking the attm that are broadly categorized into two groups, consisting of either ag or tag as the cross-over sequence.

integration of a plasmid into site a may have inactivated a putative orf region, however unchanged ap- <dig> levels and packed cell volume in mutants indicate that a preference for site a did not interfere with ap- <dig> biosynthesis or cell growth. similarly, integration into secondary sites of b, c and d did not markedly affect ap- <dig> production after  <dig> days. although rifh mutants also had unchanged ap- <dig> levels, suggesting the presence of aminodahp synthase does not have any effect on ap- <dig> biosynthesis, more work needs to be done to assess the activity of rifh in transconjugants, and to optimize substrates in the growth media, to draw any final conclusions on the effect of rifh modulation on ap- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a series of useful genetic tools for the industrially valuable bacterium a. pretiosum. stable maintenance, translational reporter function in e. coli and a. pretiosum, strong and moderate constitutive gene expression and lack of any effect on ap- <dig> production and bacterial growth are all desirable features of the pap42/43/ <dig> vectors.
