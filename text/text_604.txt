BACKGROUND
we consider undirected, unweighted biological networks that can be represented by a symmetric adjacency matrix a = . the adjacency aij between nodes i and j equals  <dig> if the nodes are connected and  <dig> otherwise. for notational convenience, we set the diagonal elements to  <dig>  while the adjacency matrix considers each pair of genes in isolation, topological overlap considers each pair of genes in relation to all other genes in the network. more specifically, genes are said to have high topological overlap if they are connected to roughly the same group of genes in the network . to calculate the topological overlap for a pair of genes, their connections with all other genes in the network are compared. if the  <dig> nodes connect to the same group of other nodes, then they have a high 'topological overlap'. here we study the properties of the topological overlap measure  and propose a generalization that enriches tom's sensitivity to longer ranging connections between nodes.

there is empirical evidence that two substrates having a higher overlap are more likely to belong to the same functional class than substrates having a lower topological overlap  <cit> . such a finding prompts the question whether a measure of topological overlap based on higher-order neighborhoods would lead to a more sensitive and robust measure of interconnectedness. in this paper, we generalize the topological overlap measure by incorporating information from higher-order neighborhoods and show that it leads to a definition of larger modules. specifically, the m-th order topological overlap measure is constructed by  counting the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share and  normalizing it to take a value between  <dig> and  <dig>  the resulting node similarity measure is a measure of agreement between the m-step neighborhoods of  <dig> input nodes. such a measure can be applied in a number of ways, for instance, ranking the genes, similarity search, prediction based on k-nearest neighbors, multi-dimensional scaling and module identification by clustering.

RESULTS
the algebraic definition of the topological overlap measure can be found in eq.  in the methods section. here we provide a more intuitive set theoretic interpretation of the topological overlap measure. our generalization of the tom is motivated by the observation that eq.  can be expressed as

tij={|n1∩n1|+aijmin⁡{|n1|,|n1|}+1−aijif i≠j1if i=j.

where n <dig> denotes the set of direct neighbors of i excluding i itself and |·| denotes the number of elements  in its argument. the quantity |n <dig> ∩ n1| measures the number of common neighbors that nodes i and j share whereas |n1| gives the number of neighbors of i. the topological overlap tij assumes a minimal value of  <dig> if there is no direct linkage between the two nodes and if they share no common direct neighbors. it assumes a maximum value of  <dig> if there is a direct link between the two nodes and if one set of direct neighbors is a subset of the other. the fact that tij is bounded between  <dig> and  <dig> is used in the definition of the topological overlap based dissimilarity measure .

generalizing tom to m-step neighborhoods
by denoting nm  the set of nodes  that are reachable from i within a path of length m, i.e.,

nm := {j ≠ i|dist ≤ m}     

where dist is the geodesic distance  between i and j, we obtain a very natural generalization of the tom, which reads as follows

tij={|nm∩nm|+aijmin⁡{|nm|,|nm|}+1−aijif i≠j1if i=j.

predicting essential proteins in a drosophila protein network
knock-out experiments in lower organisms  have shown that essential proteins tend to be more highly connected than non-essential proteins  <cit> . to illustrate the biological usefulness of the proposed interconnectedness measures, we set out to test the ability of gtom to predict essential proteins using a drosophila  protein-protein interaction network from the biogrid database  <cit> . in our version of the database, the largest connected component was comprised of  <dig> proteins with  <dig> pairwise interactions. knock-out experiments had implicated  <dig> essential proteins.

to illustrate the use of gtomm, we will show that proteins that are highly interconnected with an essential protein have an increased chance of being essential as well. toward this end, we make use of the following terminology. a gtomm neighborhood of size s around node i is defined as the set gtomhoods

since essential proteins may participate in the same pathway, it is biologically plausible that the gtomm neighborhoods of an initial essential protein contain essential proteins as well. below, we show that for a fixed neighborhood size s and a fixed essential protein, the gtom <dig> neighborhood contains a higher proportion of essential proteins than the corresponding gtom <dig> or gtom <dig> neighborhoods. this provides indirect empirical evidence that the proposed higher order gtom measure  outperforms the standard gtom measure  in this application.

specifically, we considered the neighborhoods around each of the  <dig> essential proteins with highest nodal degrees . since on average the gtom <dig> neighborhoods of these essential hub proteins contain  <dig> proteins, we considered the following neighborhood sizes s =  <dig> ...,  <dig>  for each of the essential hub proteins, we determined the gtomm neighborhood for m =  <dig> , <dig> . for a given neighborhood of size s, we determined the proportion of essential proteins. next we averaged these proportions across the  <dig> essential hub proteins. figure  <dig> reports the average proportion of essential proteins  versus different neighborhood sizes .

as can be seen from figure  <dig>  gtom <dig> performs better than the other measures in this application involving a relatively sparse network. for example, when considering neighborhoods comprised of  <dig> proteins  based on gtom <dig>  gtom <dig>  gtom <dig>  gtom <dig> the proportion of essential proteins is given by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. we find that neighborhood analysis with gtom <dig> leads to significantly better results than gtom <dig> , gtom <dig>  and gtom <dig> p-value =  <dig> ).

module detection in a yeast co-expression network
there is evidence that genes and their protein products carry out cellular processes in the context of functional modules  <cit> . thus, an important task in biological network analysis is to identify groups, or 'modules', of densely interconnected genes. here we focus on module identification methods that are based on using a node dissimilarity measure in conjunction with a clustering method. further, we assume that the nodes in a network module have high topological overlap with their neighbors. a review of alternative module detection methods is beyond the scope of this article, see e.g.  <cit> .

to demonstrate the usefulness of the gtom dissimilarity measures for module detection, we apply the proposed measures to gene co-expression networks constructed based on a microarray dataset recording gene expression levels during different stages of cell cycle in yeast  <cit> . because the transcriptional response of cells to changing conditions involves the coordinated co-expression of genes encoding interacting proteins, studying co-expression patterns can provide insights into the underlying cellular processes  <cit> . as detailed in the methods section, the co-expression network was constructed by thresholding the absolute pair-wise  correlation coefficient between the expression profiles. we cluster the genes into modules using the average linkage hierarchical clustering with different choices of dissimilarity measures. modules correspond to branches of the resulting clustering tree. while there is evidence that this clustering procedure leads to biologically meaningful modules in several applications  <cit> , we do not claim that this clustering method is optimal. since our interest lies in the performance of topological overlap based dissimilarity measures but not the clustering procedure, comparing different clustering procedures is beyond the scope of this article. in our applications, modules correspond to branches of a hierarchical clustering dendrogram  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the modules  detected by applying the average linkage hierarchical clustering with  <dig> different similarity measures: the adjacency matrix , ravasz et al.'s tom  and a generalized tom  presented in the results section. genes that belong to the functional class 'protein biosynthesis' are grouped together when the gtom <dig> measure is used. however, they are separated into two distinct subgroups if gtom <dig> or gtom <dig> are used. this suggests that gtom <dig> is a more sensitive measure for detecting the higher order connections between the nodes in this large module. thus membership in the protein biosynthesis module is more robust when neighborhoods of step size  <dig> is used for measuring topological overlap.

for the sake of brevity, we only present our analysis of the protein biosynthesis module in this methodological paper. since the protein biosynthesis pathway is relatively large, it makes sense to use a relatively sensitive dissimilarity measure  since it favors the discovery of large modules. however, when considering a functional category that involves few genes, it would be better to use a dissimilarity measure with higher specificity  since it favors the discovery of smaller modules. a more detailed biological analysis of a related yeast co-expression network can be found in  <cit> .

comparing gtomm to the correlation coefficient
since the absolute value of the pearson correlation coefficient is widely used for clustering gene expression profiles, we compare it here to the gtom measures. specifically, we consider the following class of correlation based dissimilarities:

dijc,=1−|ρij|p.     
 mathtype@mtef@5@5@+=feaafiart1ev1aaatcvaufkttlearuwrp9mdh5mbpbiqv92aaexatlxbi9gbaebbnrfifhhdyfgasaach8aky=wiffydh8gipec8eeeu0xxdbba9frfj0=oqffea0dxdd9vqai=hguq8kuc9pgc9s8qqaq=dirpe0xb9q8qilsfr0=vr0=vr0dc8meaabaqaciaacagaaeqabaqabegadaaakeaacqwgkbazdaqhaawcbagaemyaakmaemoaaogabagaee4qamkaeiilawiaei4waslaemicaanaeiyxa0faaogaeyypa0jaegymaejaeyoei0iaeiifawhccigae8xwdi3aasbaasqaaiabdmgapjabdqgaqbqabagccqgg8bafdaahaawcbeqaaiabdchawbaakiabc6cauiaaxmaacawljawaaewaaeaacqai1aqnaiaawicacaglpaaaaaa@47a3@

here, ρij is the  correlation coefficient between the expression profiles of i and j. setting p =  <dig> yields the absolute correlation coefficient which is widely used for clustering genes. setting p >  <dig> has the effect of emphasizing larger values of |ρij| while deemphasizing the smaller ones. we consider p =  <dig> since we find that the resulting distance is highly related to gtom <dig> in the yeast dataset. such a setting has also been used in  <cit>  for functional annotation.

hierarchical clustering and gtom plots
in networks involving few nodes, modules can easily be identified by inspecting the network but for large networks involving hundreds of nodes, it is useful to provide a 'reduced' view of the network. for example, one can visualize the topological overlap dissimilarity using classical multi-dimensional scaling plots  <cit> , see the multi-dimensional scaling plots section. alternatively, it can be useful to visualize the topological overlap dissimilarity matrix

but a more subtle analysis provides indirect empirical evidence of the usefulness of gtom <dig> for module definition. note that a second color bar is included on the left of the heatmap. here, dark red indicates the membership to the class 'protein biosynthesis'. genes that belong to other classes  are depicted by a gray color in the bar. we observe that protein biosynthesis genes are grouped together in the gtom <dig> and gtom <dig> plots.

multi-dimensional scaling plots
we visualize the dissimilarity measures using classical multi-dimensional scaling  plots. classical multidimensional scaling takes as input matrix a dissimilarity matrix . the result of multi-dimensional scaling are vectors in a low dimensional euclidean space  such that the euclidean distances between the vectors approximate the dissimilarities. to compute these vectors, an eigenvector problem is solved to find the locations that minimize distortions to the dissimilarity matrix  <cit> .

the mds plots are shown in figure  <dig>  all the plots are color-coded according to the modules with respect to gtom <dig> depicted in figure  <dig>  the relative position of the points are well-preserved as we can see that points having the same color are almost always clustered together. genes that belong to the class 'protein biosynthesis' are depicted by the symbol '▲'. other genes are denoted by a '○'. interestingly, almost all 'protein biosynthesis' genes are in the vicinity of each other. the plot using the gtom <dig> dissimilarity in figure 5b shows a more clear separation between the red and brown modules.

we observe from the mds plots that there is a tendency of consolidation as the order m of the gtom measure increases. this phenomenon can be seen in figure 5d where gtom <dig> is used and a few 'sinks'  have been formed.

robustness of the results to network perturbations
to demonstrate that gtom <dig> may outperform gtom <dig> and gtom <dig> in the case of noisy network data, we randomly removed connections in the yeast gene co-expression network. specifically, we randomly set a proportion p =  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  of entries in the adjacency matrix to  <dig>  we used the perturbed network to compute the corresponding gtomm measures . to quantify the ability of gtomm to separate protein biosynthesis genes  from non-protein biosynthesis genes  we defined a measure of separation, which is motivated by the intergroup dissimilarity measures used in average linkage hierarchical clustering. specifically, we define

a simple example
an example comparing modules detected by the gtom <dig> and gtom <dig> similarities is given in figure  <dig>  as a rule of thumb, if many of the nodes in a module are separated by a distance of  <dig> or  <dig> from each other, then they form a tight module with respect to the gtom <dig> similarity. likewise, if many of the nodes in a module are separated by a distance of  <dig> or  <dig> from each other, then they form a tight module with respect to the gtom <dig> similarity.

the asymptotic behavior of gtomm for large m
here we consider the situation when m is larger than or equal to the network diameter, i.e. each pair of nodes can be connected with a path of length ≤ m. in this case, |nm| = n -  <dig> and |nm ∩ nm| = n -  <dig> where n denotes the network size. then

when n is large. this demonstrates that for sufficiently large values of m all pairs of nodes within a connected network component will be highly interconnected. thus, large and tight modules result when gtomm with large m is used as input of a clustering procedure, see figure  <dig> 

choosing the order m
how to choose the order m is an important question in many applications. while it seems intuitive that the choice of m has some relationship to the network diameter, it is unclear to us how to use the network diameter to guide the choice of m .

in general, the optimal choice of m will depend on the data quality and the goals of the analysis. roughly speaking, if the adjacency matrix contains very few errors and if the goal is to determine which nodes are linked to a given node then m =  <dig> is the obvious choice. but if many adjacencies have falsely been set to  <dig>  and/or if the goal is to detect possibly longer ranging interactions then relatively large values of m may uncover that  <dig> nodes are interconnected even if the corresponding adjacency is  <dig> 

when an external label is available for at least some of the nodes then one can use it to inform the choice of m. for example, when the external node label y encodes group membership, then one can choose m so that the groups have high within group interconnectedness and low between group interconnectedness. to make this more specific, we assume that there is evidence that the nodes of group  <dig> are highly interconnected and that they are well separated from nodes of group  <dig>  for example, in our yeast gene co-expression network, we have shown above that the average gtomm measure between protein biosynthesis genes  is larger than the average gtomm measure between protein biosynthesis genes and non-protein biosynthesis genes .

analogous to eq.  <dig>  we define the following measure of mean gtom difference between the  <dig> groups

gtomdiff:=∑i≠jtiji∑i≠ji−∑i≠jtiji∑i≠ji

discussion
several measures that keep track of shared  <dig> step neighbors have been proposed in the literature, e.g.  <cit> . here, we propose a natural generalization of the widely used topological overlap matrix. this class of new measures is constructed by keeping track of the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share. the gtom similarity measure is normalized to take on values in the unit interval. a corresponding dissimilarity measure can be defined by subtracting the gtom similarity from  <dig> 

while we find it a worthwhile goal for future research to develop statistical or heuristic criteria for choosing m, we find that a main advantage of gtomm is that it allows one to assess the robustness of network analysis results. in many applications , it will be worthwhile to show that the results are relatively robust with respect to m since this indicates that the biological signal is strong. while we present applications where non-standard choices of m lead to superior results, we have found in several other  applications that the results are robust with respect to m =  <dig> ,  <dig>  by randomly deleting network adjacencies in the yeast gene co-expression network application, we have shown that large values of m can counter the effect of misspecified  adjacencies. gtomm becomes uninformative if m is larger than the network diameter. thus, gtomm will be useful in networks with moderate or large 'degree of separation' . since biological networks tend to have low diameters  <cit> , we expect that low values of m will be preferable in most applications. but we have provided two real data applications where m =  <dig> is preferable over m =  <dig>  in general, the gtom measures with lower orders m will be useful for discovering small modules while those with higher orders favor the discovery of larger modules.

a limitation of our approach is that it is only defined for unweighted networks, i.e. the entries of the adjacency matrix should be  <dig> or  <dig>  another limitation is that we only consider the topological overlap between  <dig> nodes. a multi-node extension of the gtom <dig> measure is presented in  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the generalized topological overlap measure can serve as a filter for countering the effect of spurious or missing connections. the order m of the topological overlap measure can serve as a tuning parameter for interconnectedness that trades off sensitivity versus specificity. since different orders of m probe different neighborhoods, adjusting m allows the user to consider network modules at different 'zoom' levels. we provide additional materials and methods as well as the statistical software code, a tutorial along with customized r functions, and the accompanying data files at the web page  <cit> . thus, the reader should be able to reproduce all of our findings.
