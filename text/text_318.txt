BACKGROUND
microarrays have rapidly become the assay of choice for clinical investigators wanting to measure gene expression, owing to their high-throughput and relative ease of use. as with any assay, it is critical that experimental variance is minimized in order to permit measurement of true biological variance. in clinical microarray studies, the sources of experimental variance can be considerable. while a range of corrections exist to detect and correct for variability introduced during hybridization and due to chip quality, little attention has been paid to the impact of specimen collection, handling and processing on the resulting gene expression measures.

for immunological studies, peripheral blood is commonly used in microarray experiments, as it is the most easily obtained source of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and other cells that may provide insight into immune function. historically, gradient density-based methods have been used to purify white blood cells from peripheral blood. however, it is known that, within minutes of collection, peripheral blood gene expression profiles change significantly due to transcript induction and transcript degradation <cit> , and it is almost certain that the purification process introduces further changes in expressed transcripts.

to address these concerns, rna whole blood collection tubes have been developed that have the considerable advantage of lysing whole blood at the time of collection, while simultaneously stabilizing rna for later purification. the paxgene™ whole blood rna isolation system contains a proprietary solution that reduces rna degradation and transcript induction upon peripheral blood collection  <cit> . using the qiagen total rna isolation method, this system has been evaluated for clinical applications using rt-pcr <cit>  and affymetrix microarrays  <cit> ; in some cases it has shown a lack of concordance in gene expression with other isolation methods <cit> . the tempus™ whole blood rna isolation system offers an alternative approach to peripheral blood rna isolation, again using a proprietary solution to directly lyse whole blood and stabilize rna. there have, as yet, been no reports of the efficiency or accuracy of the tempus™ whole blood rna isolation system or comparisons to other methods.

in this report, we compare these two whole blood rna purification methods for use in microarray experiments to measure immune response gene expression, and show that the choice of rna purification method can have significant implications. using phytohemagglutinin  stimulated whole blood as a test case, we found that rna yield and hybridization quality indicators were better for rna isolated using the tempus™ rna purification method. while pha induced a set of transcript expression changes detected in both tempus™ and paxgene™ samples, use of the tempus system resulted in the identification of a greater number of gene expression changes that would be expected to result from pha stimulation.

RESULTS
rna yield and hybridization quality indicators
rna yield, rna purity, and post-hybridization quality indicators were compared for specimens collected directly into the two whole blood rna isolation system tubes. slightly higher mean rna yields were observed in samples isolated using the tempus™ system compared to paxgene™ , with tempus™ samples showing greater variability. rna yield was adjusted for blood collection starting volumes, which was  <dig> ml for tempus ™ and  <dig>  ml for paxgene™. tempus™-collected specimens yielded a higher purity of rna, based on higher od260/230ratios  and higher "percent present calls", an indicator of the number of transcripts reliably detected . in addition, rna isolated by the tempus™ methodology showed decreased gapdh 3'/5' ratios. this is an indicator for rna degradation where crna synthesis is 3' biased, hence the more degraded the rna the less signal for probes detecting the 5' end of transcripts .

controlling for li heparin
we aimed to compare gene expression profiles of peripheral blood rna from cells stimulated by phytohemagglutinin , a mitogen known to induce expression of immune activation transcripts including those for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifnγ <cit> . however, because blood collection with either tempus™ or paxgene™ systems results in immediate lysis of peripheral blood cells, blood had to be collected first and subsequently pha-stimulated in li heparin tubes , prior to transfer to the test systems.

to control for the effect of li heparin tube collection, we performed an initial comparison of  <dig> healthy control samples drawn directly in paxgene™ or tempus™ tubes vs. the same  <dig> healthy control samples drawn in li heparin tubes with no pha stimulation. rnas were hybridized to the hg-u <dig>  <dig>  plus affymetrix genechip® microarray. only two transcripts, for the b-cell translocation transcript btg- <dig>  were identified as down-regulated in samples collected with li heparin tubes, compared to those collected in tempus tubes. interestingly, just one transcript was up-regulated using paxgene™ tubes, corresponding to one of the transcripts up-regulated in the tempus™ system, btg <dig>  these results suggest that collection of samples into li heparin tubes prior to pha stimulation had a minimal effect on differential expression and would have negligible effect on the interpretation of differences between the two tube types.

detection of transcriptional response to pha stimulation
to compare paxgene™ and tempus™ tubes, whole blood samples collected in li heparin tubes from  <dig> healthy controls were split into pha-stimulated or unstimulated aliquots. after  <dig> hrs, samples were transferred to each respective rna isolation system and hybridized to the hg-u <dig>  <dig>  plus affymetrix genechip® microarray.

hierarchical clustering of absolute expression levels, irrespective of gene function, showed that the primary separation occurred between stimulated vs. unstimulated samples . the clustering was generated on the  <dig> individual samples using the  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts that were either up- or down-regulated by pha-stimulation . stimulation condition forms a primary division, followed by a secondary split based on paxgene™ or tempus™ collection. however, hierarchical clustering of the change in expression level between nonstimulated and stimulated samples per participant showed a fair degree of consistency across paxgene™ and tempus™ systems, as illustrated in figure 2b. in order to determine how use of either platform influences measures of gene expression of the transcripts of interest, a breakdown of overlap and concordance of up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts for each platform was performed.

pha-stimulation resulted in  <dig> transcripts being detected as upregulated, and  <dig> downregulated when the tempus™ system was used. for the paxgene™ system,  <dig> were found to be upregulated and  <dig> downregulated  by pha stimulation . among all of these,  <dig> upregulated  and  <dig> downregulated transcripts  were common between the two platforms. among the  <dig> upregulated immune function transcripts uniquely identified by the tempus™ whole blood rna isolation system were il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifnγ, stat <dig>  irf <dig>  il-21r, cla <dig>  cd <dig>  bcl <dig> and stat <dig>  in contrast, the  <dig> upregulated immune function transcripts uniquely identified by the paxgene™ whole blood rna isolation system included il-2ra, bcl <dig> , il-1rn, ccl <dig>  and cd <dig> . expression profiles of several transcripts known to be up-regulated by pha such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifnγ  <cit>  are illustrated for all  <dig> subjects in fig 3a. samples isolated using paxgene™ preparation resulted in  <dig> transcripts uniquely identified as down-regulated, while tempus™ tube preparation resulted in  <dig> transcripts not identified as down-regulated by paxgene™  .

to validate differential expression measured by microarray, real time pcr was performed on four of the seven samples that had sufficient rna remaining. using the sequenom quantitative gene expression  platform, eighteen immune function transcripts were assessed, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifnγ, controls and others not known to be regulated by pha. other transcripts assessed include: tgfβ, p <dig>  perforin, mig, ip <dig>  il <dig>  gb, foxp <dig>  cxcr <dig>  ctla <dig>  ctgf, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  transcripts for ifnγ, il- <dig>  il- <dig> were statistically significant for differential expression between un-stimulated and stimulated samples using the tempus™ system . samples prepared using the paxgene™ system exhibited greater variability in transcript levels in both unstimulated and stimulated conditions, thus trending towards upregulation for il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifnγ, but not statistically significant .

discussion
while there are an increasing number of studies using microarrays and/or quantitative real time pcr as immune monitoring tools in clinical trials, there have been few studies assessing the contribution of the rna purification method to the expressed gene profile. here, we have demonstrated that the choice of rna preparation method can have significant influence on resulting gene expression measures.

using pha-stimulated versus unstimulated whole blood as a model, we anticipated that a large number of transcripts would be differentially expressed, given that pha is global activator of human peripheral t lymphocytes and has been shown to induce a number of immune response transcripts, including several cytokines. indeed, microarray analysis revealed that pha altered the expression of a large number of transcripts, regardless of whether rna purification was performed by tempus™ or paxgene™ methods. while both methods revealed a common set of  <dig> transcripts whose expression was altered by pha-stimulation, tempus™-prepared specimens revealed an additional  <dig> up-regulated transcripts that were not detected in paxgene™-prepared specimens, many of which fall into the category of immune response or cellular proliferation transcripts. notable in this group are immune response transcripts such as the cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifnγ, which are known to be induced by pha <cit> . transcriptional changes could not be attributed to differences in cell numbers since  <dig> hours of stimulation by pha is not long enough to increase cell numbers.

such differences in expression results may reflect differences in quality of the purified rna: in these experiments, use of the paxgene™ resulted in poorer rna quality and post-hybridization metrics compared to specimens prepared using the tempus system. in addition, rna yields, on average, were higher using the tempus™ system, as were microarray quality assurance measures such as rna purity and percent present calls.

in human gene expression profile studies, the combination of biological variation as well as technical variation from sample to sample plays a greater role than in many other experimental settings. this is primarily due to the fact that there is no ability to repeat a condition and that it is not possible to provide technical replicates for each condition, meaning that each individual patient for a given condition or treatment is treated as a biological "replicate". in this case, the differential expression between unstimulated and pha-stimulated transcripts with respect to fold-change across patients was more variable with paxgene™ rna. mean expression estimates for immune function transcripts most often had higher standard errors that led to higher p-values using the paxgene™ system.

CONCLUSIONS
overall these findings have important implications for the use of gene expression profiling to monitor immune system changes in humans. given the biological variation of humans and the differences in sample handling inherent in multicenter clinical trials, controlled sample processing and quality is essential to ensure valid results. there may be advantages and disadvantages to each platform based on issues such as blood volume, cost, or need for automation. these studies demonstrate that the choice of platform, and its associated methods, is important for defining expressed transcripts, and that reproducibility and quality in rna preparation are critical to define changes in expressed gene profiles that meet the statistical rigor necessary for interpretation and validation of signatures for clinical trial monitoring.
