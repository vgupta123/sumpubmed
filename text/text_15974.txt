BACKGROUND
tissue-specific promoters may be utilized for a variety of applications, including programmed gene expression in cell types, tissues and organs of interest, and for developing different cell culture models or for use in gene therapy. for example, one of the most promising approaches of gene therapy is the delivery of "suicide" genes under transcriptional control of promoters highly active in cancer cells . in therapeutic constructs it is extremely important to precisely tune the transcriptional activity of the gene expression system in order to ensure the safety of a gene-therapeutic drug for normal tissues. to reach this goal, native promoter sequences are frequently modified by deleting or adding different regulatory motifs, most frequently - transcription factor recognition sites  <cit> .

among the suicide genes, the most efficient are those that have a "bystander" effect, i.e. activity not only for the cells that received the gene construct, but also for the neighboring cells. the bystander effect is especially valuable when the efficiency of gene delivery into the cell nuclei is low, as it is the case for a number of human tissues  <cit> . this makes it possible that even a small number of transfected cells expressing a therapeutic construct may cause massive target cell death in a malignant tissue  <cit> . however, fine tuning of gene activity is more precise in binary systems that may include a suicide gene product  and its chemical substrate that together elicit a cytotoxic effect. in this system, both the gene product and the substrate are harmless when present separately in the cell. however, codelivery of the enzyme and its substrate results in conversion of the substrate into a toxic metabolite that kills the cell. several, efficient binary systems have been developed to date, for example, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with gancyclovir  <cit> , or cytosine deaminase with 5-fluoro cytosine  <cit> .

in this paper we describe a novel, genetically engineered, tissue-specific promoter and propose two, related gene cassettes for generation of gene therapeutic constructs.

previous studies suggested that the long terminal repeats  of human endogenous retroviruses exhibit significant enhancer activity in vitro  <cit> . for the herv-k  elements, this effect was especially strong in cultured human testicular germ cells, in good agreement with numerous reports documenting high transcriptional activities of the herv-k  elements in germ cell-derived cancer tissues . many herv-k  genomic inserts are located in upstream regions of genes close to transcriptional start sites, and theoretically may serve as functional enhancer elements in vivo  <cit> . we hypothesized that removing non - herv-k -associated regulatory elements from the upstream regions of these genes might switch their promoter specificities towards relatively higher expression in germ cells. we have tested this hypothesis on the human gene ndufv <dig> that has a herv-k  ltr relatively close to its transcriptional start site . considering that important regulatory sequences are frequently conserved, we removed all conserved motifs from the ndufv <dig> upstream region.

here we show that the resulting modified ndufv <dig> upstream sequence  may serve as a strong, tissue-specific promoter. on a panel of twelve human cell lines we show that mnus provides strong, selective gene expression in testicular, germ-derived cells. this specificity was further supported by a selective cytotoxic effect of an mnus-driven suicide gene , only in cultured germ-derived cells. finally, transposase expression under transcriptional control of mnus, provided selective, germ cell-specific genomic sleeping beauty transposition. our data suggest that mnus may be used as an efficient, tissue-specific promoter for germ cells.

RESULTS
modification of ndufv <dig> upstream sequence
ndufv <dig> encodes the mitochondrial protein nadh dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein  <dig> and is expressed in all human tissues as a housekeeping gene  <cit> . at the distance of ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the ndufv <dig> transcriptional start site there is a herv-k  endogenous retroviral solitary ltr element. bioinformatical screening has revealed a highly conserved,  <dig> bp-long sequence exactly upstream the ndufv <dig> transcriptional start site . in order to test the possibility that removal of this conserved sequence may alter tissue specificity of the ndufv <dig> upstream region, we have pcr-amplified and cloned two genomic fragments, one including the whole,  <dig> bp-long upstream sequence, and the other,  <dig> bp-long sequence lacking the conserved region. primary structure of both cloned fragments was confirmed by sequencing. the shorter sequence termed modified ndufv <dig> upstream sequence  was further compared with the native upstream region  with respect to transcriptional activity in functional tests.

tissue specificity of mnus promoter
promoter activity of mnus was tested using the pgl <dig> basic vector  that includes the firefly luciferase reporter gene, but lacks any promoter and enhancer elements. we cloned mnus and nus into pgl <dig> basic upstream of the reporter gene. for functional tests we chose seven established human cell lines and four primary cell cultures of different origin. cell lines were: tera- <dig>  ep <dig>  tera- <dig> , ngp <dig> , hepg <dig> , a <dig>  and hek <dig> . primary human cell cultures included macrophages, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells , placental mesenchymal stem cells  and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells .

nus and mnus promoter activities were measured using "dual luciferase" system in a series of transient transfection experiments . to minimize errors caused by the differences in transfection efficiencies in the independent replicates, reporter firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of herpes simplex virus promoter-driven renilla luciferase expressed from the cotransfected plasmid prl-tk that provides relatively uniform levels of renilla luciferase expression in cell types of different origin . we compared nus/mnus and virus sv <dig> promoter activities.

the intact sequence  displayed high promoter activity in the majority of tested cell types . in most of cell cultures , nus activity was significantly higher than that of the sv <dig> promoter . however, a very different pattern was observed for the modified upstream sequence that showed a sharp decrease in all cell types, except in tera- <dig> and ep <dig> . for example, relative to nus, mnus activity has diminished ~65-fold in hepg <dig>  ~35-, 33-, 19- fold in uc-msc, ngp <dig>  tera- <dig>  but only about 2-fold in tera- <dig> and ep <dig> cells. in the absolute values, in tera- <dig> cells mnus activity was about twice as high as that of the sv <dig> promoter, whereas for the other cell types it was hardly detectable. these data suggest that the  <dig> bp-long sequence located just upstream of the ndufv <dig> transcriptional start site plays a key role in the activity of this gene promoter in vitro in the majority of tested cell types. interestingly, there was a remarkable difference between mnus promoter activities in tera- <dig>  ep <dig> and tera- <dig> cells: in contrast to high values in tera- <dig> and ep <dig>  it was far lower in tera- <dig>  although all three cell lines have been established from testicular germ cell tumors, tera- <dig> and ep <dig> cells represent undifferentiated germ cell precursors, whereas tera- <dig> cells are derived from partially differentiated cells  <cit> .

these results suggest that mnus is a highly tissue-specific promoter. its activity is relatively high in undifferentiated testicular germ cells, and negligible in all other cell types tested. in further experiments, we aimed to investigate the potential value of mnus for biotechnological applications.

functional tests of mnus-rcd in suicide gene therapy assays
in order to estimate the potential value of mnus for suicide gene therapy, we designed a construct having a suicide gene under transcriptional control of mnus promoter. as a suicide gene, the recombinant bifunctional yeast cytosine deaminase  previously engineered by erbs and co-authors  <cit>  was chosen. cd normally converts cytosine into uracil. however, this enzyme also deaminates the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine  to the highly toxic chemotherapeutic drug 5-fruorouracil. the latter molecule is converted by the cellular enzymatic machinery to 5-fluoro-utp and 5-fluoro-dump. 5-fluoro-utp is included into rna molecules, which results in the inhibition of the nuclear processing of the ribosomal and mrnas, whereas 5-fluoro-dump irreversibly inhibits thymidylate synthase, preventing dna synthesis. finally, cd cytotoxicity is greatly amplified due to bystander effect  <cit> .

recombinant cd  was cloned into plasmid vectors containing the tissue-specific mnus or constitutive cytomegaloviral  promoters or a vector lacking any promoter and enhancer elements that was used as negative control in functional tests. rcd gene activity was pre-tested using no-rcd and cmv-rcd constructs in tera- <dig> cells, and rcd expression was visualized by western blot analysis. cmv promoter was chosen for positive control experiments because it was highly active in our tests in both tera- <dig> and hek  <dig> cell lines .

along with untransfected controls, part of the transfected cells was exposed to 5-fluorocytosine , another part did not receive 5fc. forty-eight hours after addition of 5fc, cell viability was measured using propidium iodide  tests. as expected, there was an overall correlation between the rcd expression and observed cytotoxicity . the proportion of dead cells was almost equal for untransfected tera- <dig> cells both exposed and not exposed to 5fc, and for the no-rcd tera- <dig> transfectants . however, in the exposed cmv-rcd transfectants ~65% of the cells died, as compared to ~10% in unexposed cmv-rcd cells. therefore, in good agreement with published data  <cit> , cytotoxic activity of rcd completely depended on the presence of 5fc in our tests. furthermore, rcd activity was promoter-dependent as in the promoter-less construct there was no toxic effect, whereas the cmv-rcd construct was highly toxic for the +5fc  cells. importantly, in our system there was no promoter "leakage" to produce background cytotoxicity. finally, 5fc itself was not toxic, whereas in combination with rcd its product was efficiently killing the cells.

functional tests of mnus-rcd were performed on tera- <dig> and hek <dig> cells. in the previous assay, the highest activity of mnus-driven luciferase was observed in germ cancer-derived cells , whereas reporter gene expression was significantly lower in other cell cultures. for testing tissue-specificity of mnus-rcd, hek <dig> cells were used as a control as they were demonstrating the highest mnus-driven expression except for tera- <dig> and ep <dig> cells . cells were transiently transfected with the mnus-rcd, positive control cmv-rcd and negative control no-rcd expression plasmids and then grown in +5fc medium .  <dig> and  <dig> hours after addition of the 5fc, cell viability was measured using the propidium iodide  and annexin v tests. in our experiments, both assays gave similar results .

acell viability tests shown on this table were done  <dig> hours after application of 5fc. "-5fc" means "no 5fc was added", "+fc" marks experiments with the addition of 5fc to the medium. "-transf.", "no-rcd", "mnus-rcd" and "cmv-rcd" mean "no transfection", "transfection with no-rcd construct", "transfection with mnus-rcd" and "transfection with cmv-rcd", accordingly.

bpropidium iodide tests were done at least in quadruplicates. the data represent integral proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells.

cannexin v assay was performed for all the experiments with the addition of 5fc to the medium. tests were done in triplicates. the data represent integral proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells.

for tera- <dig>  we observed background numbers  of dead cells for all the transfectants grown in -5fc medium, very similar values to negative controls grown in the +5fc medium. in the positive controls , cell death rate was ~65-67%. finally, in mnus-rcd transfectants , we observed ~59-60% of dead cells.

in hek <dig>  all transfectants grown in -fc conditions and negative controls also displayed background proportion of dead cells , in contrast to high values in positive controls . in mnus-rcd transfectants , the number of dead hek  <dig> cells was close to the background level .

in sum, cytotoxicity assays have confirmed the high tissue-specificity of mnus-rcd cassette, because cytotoxicity was strong in tera- <dig> cells, but undetectable in hek <dig> cells. accordingly, it is likely that no cytotoxic effect may be seen in all other above cell cultures, as the promoter activity of mnus was lower in them than in hek <dig> 

tissue-specific transposition of sleeping beauty by mnus-specific transposase expression
to assess the applicability of the mnus promoter for tissue-specific transgene integration, we employed a transposon-based system. dna transposons are mobile elements capable to move in and into genomes using a self-encoded protein termed transposase. the transposase recognizes so-called inverted terminal repeat  sequences that flank each copy of dna transposon, and mediates physical excision of a transposon copy with further re-insertion into a new location whithin the genome  <cit> . nowadays, transposons are widely used by researchers for stable gene delivery  <cit> , in which transgene cassettes flanked by the transposon-specific itrs, are mobilized and stably integrate into the genomes of cells, in which the transposase is expressed .

we used a stable gene delivery system based on the sleeping beauty  dna transposon to further validate the tissue-specific properties of the mnus promoter. high efficiency of its transposase, recently enhanced more than 100-fold by directed mutagenesis  <cit> , and random chromosomal insertion make the sb system a method of choice for many applications  <cit> .

the enhanced sb transposase  was transiently expressed in transfected cells under the control of mnus promoter. the positive control vector had cmv promoter-driven sb100x, whereas a promoterless sb100x cassette served as negative control. sb100x vectors were cotransfected with a plasmid harboring a puromycin resistance  cassette flanked by the sb itrs . expression of sb100x mediates high number of transposition events that result in a puromycin-resistant phenotype of the cells. in our assay, we cotransfected tera- <dig> and hek <dig> cells with the pairs of sb100x-harboring vector plus itr-puro plasmid. in hek <dig> cells, the numbers of colonies seen for mnus-sb100x was very similar to those obtained in the negative control transfectants, suggesting lack of transposition. high colony numbers in the positive control indicate efficient transposition . in tera- <dig> cells, the number of colonies was low in the negative control, high in the positive control, and also high in case of mnus-sb100x transfectants .

these results suggest that mnus-based constructs may be efficiently used for the tissue-specific stable gene delivery. this is also in line with our previous findings that in tera- <dig> cells mnus promoter strength is comparable to that of the cmv promoter.

discussion
in this paper we report a novel tissue-specific promoter, mnus, that is highly active in human undifferentiated testicular germ cancer cells , but has no apparent activity in the other tested cell types. the potential applicability of this promoter element was illustrated in two examples.

first, we designed a suicide gene therapy cassette including mnus as an upstream transcriptional regulatory element, and the gene for recombinant cytosine deaminase  as a cytotoxic agent. this mnus-rcd cassette has demonstrated strong, tissue-specific cytotoxic effect restricted to germ cancer cells. we hope that high tissue specificity and low background toxicity of the mnus-based cassette may be useful for the design of novel efficient therapeuticals against germ cell tumors .

second, the mnus promoter was applied for generating a tissue-specific system for stable gene delivery. the sleeping beauty transposase expressed under transcriptional control of mnus efficiently mediated stable gene transfer into genomes of germ cells, but not in somatic control cells.

the mnus promoter element is rather large , which may limit its usefulness. however, as we show here it may be efficiently applied for both reporter constructs, gene transfer and suicide gene therapy vectors. we hope that apart from these applications, mnus may be utilized as a tool for studying development, proliferation and functional analyses of germ cells and related tissues.

our data also indicate that the major upstream regulatory elements of the native ndufv <dig> promoter are likely to be concentrated within the  <dig> bp-long region located just upstream the transcriptional start site. here we present a map of putative transcription factor binding sites  identified within nus, predicted using the transfac database . indeed, the above  <dig> bp-long region is enriched in putative tfbs, as compared to the upstream sequence. the second region where the highest concentration of tfbs occurs is located within the endogenous retroviral herv-k ltr sequence. therefore, the endogenous retroviral sequence likely plays an important role in mnus promoter activity. this hypothesis is consistent with our further results showing that in vitro promoter activity of mnus in tera- <dig> and ep <dig> cell lines was ~3- and ~4-times decreased when the herv-k ltr sequence was removed from mnus . finally, tissue-specificity of the mnus promoter may be due to the presence of sry/sox <dig> transcriptional factor recognition motifs that account, among others, for germ cell-specific transcriptional upregulation of gammaretroviruses and line- <dig> retrotransposons. seven such motifs have been identified within the mnus herv-k ltr, and six within the downstream mnus sequence . alternatively, ltr enhancer activity at least in part may be driven by nuclear factor oct3/ <dig>  this protein is known as a marker of pluripotency, that plays a pivotal role in the early stages of normal development in mammals. it was found also to be the most informative diagnostic marker for the early stages of malignant germ cell tumors. the ltr contains three oct3/ <dig> binding motifs, and the downstream mnus regulatory sequence - two additional ones. experimental functional analysis of these sites and further attempts to shorten the mnus sequence will be subject of future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that mnus may be used as an efficient promoter for tissue specific gene expression in human germ cells in various applications. our data also suggest that the  <dig> bp-long sequence located exactly upstream ndufv <dig> transcriptional start site plays a crucial role in the activity of this gene promoter in vitro in the majority of tested cell types , and an important role - in the rest two cell lines.
