BACKGROUND
mannan polysaccharides are the major components of softwood hemicellulose and can be classified into linear mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, and galactoglucomannan  <cit> . they consist of a backbone of β- <dig> -linked mannose, which may be interrupted by d-glucose in glucomannans. due to the complex nature of these polysaccharides, a combination of different enzymes such as endo- <dig> -β-mannanase , β-mannosidase , β-glucosidase , α-galactosidase  and acetyl mannan esterase  are required to complete the hydrolysis of heteromannans. among them, the most important is endo- <dig> -β-mannanase , which can catalyze random internal hydrolysis of β- <dig> -mannosidic linkages in the main structure of β- <dig> -mannans, glucomannans and galactomannans by releasing small manno-oligosaccharides  <cit> . this type of enzyme has shown a wide range of potential uses in industrial applications, including food/feed, pharmaceutical, pulp/paper, gas well stimulation  <cit> , as well as for second generation biofuels  <cit> . mannans, the major components of hemicellulose, associate with lignin and cellulose in lignocellulosic biomass, physically hindering cellulase access to the fibers and reducing the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis  <cit> . in the bioenergy process, the breakdown of lignocellulose to fermentable sugars by enzymatic hydrolysis is one of the decisive bottlenecks, due to the recalcitrance of the plant cell wall and the high cost of enzymes. based on this application, these enzymes have recently received much attention for industrial use, with an ever-increasing demand for renewable bioenergy utilization.

during the past few decades, many endo- <dig> -β-mannanases have been purified and characterized from plants, bacteria, fungi and metazoans, among which the filamentous fungi are considered to be good candidates for the industrial production of endo- <dig> -β-mannanases  <cit> . many studies have been performed focusing on discovering new endo- <dig> -β-mannanases with robust enzymatic activity by various methods, such as mutating enzyme-producing strains and optimizing fermentation conditions, and on producing endo- <dig> -β-mannanases by fermentation on an industrial scale  <cit> . however, a suitable endo- <dig> -β-mannanase for industrial use involves not only a high enzymatic hydrolysis activity; but thermo- and acidic-stability are also needed as many industrial bioprocesses require the use of enzymes at low ph and high temperature conditions to prevent contamination by other microbes .

p. oxalicum gz- <dig>  an agricultural biomass-degrading filamentous fungus, was isolated in our lab from decaying-wood acidic soil and showed favorable acidophilic hemicellulase-producing ability  <cit> . when p. oxalicum gz- <dig> was incubated with agricultural waste  as carbon source, an obvious mannanase activity could be determined in the culture supernatant . in this study, a new acidic thermostable gh <dig> endo- <dig> -β-mannanase gene  from p. oxalicum gz- <dig> was cloned and heterologously expressed in pichia pastoris gs <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first example of cloning and expression of an acidic thermostable endo- <dig> -β-mannanase gene from p. oxalicum. the biochemical characteristics of the recombinant enzyme were also evaluated. the superior biochemical and hydrolytic properties of rpoman5a make it a highly useful candidate for various industrial applications.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of the endo- <dig> -β-mannanase gene from p. oxalicum gz-2
a 772-bp gene fragment was amplified from the gdna of strain gz- <dig> using the degenerate primers mana-df and mana-dr. sequence analysis indicated that the fragment showed 76% identity with an endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from aspergillus aculeatus . to amplify the full-length endo- <dig> -β-mannanase gene the 5’ and 3’ flanking regions were obtained using self-formed adaptor pcr . all fragments were assembled with core regions to create a  <dig> bp sequence containing a complete chromosomal gene of  <dig> bp predicted by fgenesh . the full-length cdna sequence of endo- <dig> -β-mannanase  was contained in an open reading frame of  <dig> bp, which was cloned from the synthesized cdna using the mana-f and mana-r primers. three introns interrupted the poman5a coding sequence according to the alignment of the dna and cdna sequences. a putative 33-residue signal peptide at the n-terminus was predicted by the signalp server system . the deduced mature protein of poman5a contained of  <dig> residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a theoretical pi of  <dig>  . the deduced amino acid sequence of poman5a showed the highest identity of 100% with the putative endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from penicillium oxalicum 114- <dig> . poman5a contained an n-terminal fungal cellulose binding domain and a glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> domain. after multiple sequence alignments with other gh <dig> endo- <dig> -β-mannanase amino acid sequences, the two catalytic glutamates  are located in highly conserved regions of the active site in poman5a. several amino acid residues, arg <dig>  trp <dig>  asn <dig>  his <dig>  and tyr <dig> are conserved in poman5a and other fungal gh <dig> endo-β- <dig>  4-mannanases . the nucleotide sequence of poman5a was deposited into genebank under accession number kf <dig> figure  <dig>

heterologous expression and purification of the p. oxalicum endo- <dig> -β-mannanase
the gene expression vector ppic-man5a was successfully constructed for use in this study. in this recombinant plasmid, cdna fragments were fused with the α-factor signal sequence at its n-terminus allowing secretion of enzyme into the liquid culture that was expressed under the control of the aox <dig> promoter. the resulting plasmid was then transformed into pichia pastoris by electroporation. after transformation and screening on plates containing zeocin in increasing concentrations,  <dig> transformants showing robust antibiotic-resistance were further evaluated for their ability to secrete endo- <dig> -β-mannanase in a small-scale liquid fermentation. one transformant with the highest enzyme activity was used to produce endo- <dig> -β-mannanase in a  <dig> l erlenmeyer flask induced by 1% methanol at 28°c for  <dig> days. the highest extracellular endo- <dig> -β-mannanase activity  was obtained after a  <dig> day incubation at 28°c. sds-page analysis of the culture supernatants of the induction period from  <dig> to  <dig> day showed an apparent protein band  corresponding to endo- <dig> -β-mannanase activity in the zymogram analysis . no endo- <dig> -β-mannanase activity was detected in the culture medium of the control strain  under the same culture conditions. the recombinant endo- <dig> -β-mannanase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity through ni-nta chromatography. after ni-nta purification, a  <dig> -fold purification was achieved with 56% recovery. the purified rpoman5a showed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda by sds-page .figure  <dig>

effect of temperature and ph on rpoman5a activity and stability
the effects of temperature and ph on rpoman5a activity were investigated using locust bean gum as the substrate. the rpoman5a showed optimal activity at the temperature of 80°c and ph  <dig> - <dig>  and exhibited over 50% activity in temperatures ranging from 40°c to 90°c . the thermal stability profiles showed that rpoman5a was stable at temperatures below 70°c . almost no enzyme activity  was lost after  <dig> h incubation at 60°c, and the half-life at this temperature was  <dig> h. at 70°c, the half-life of the enzyme was only  <dig> min. the rpoman5a retained more than 96% of its maximal activity at ph  <dig>  . the ph stability profiles showed that the enzyme was highly stable within a broad range of ph values, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

effect of metal ions and chemical reagents on endo- <dig> -β-mannanase activity
the presence of most metal ions at  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm  had little or no effect on the activity of rpoman5a. at the high concentrations of cu2+ and fe3+ , the activity of rpoman5a was reduced to almost 50%. the whole activity of rpoman5a was lost in the presence of  <dig> mm hg2+ . β-mercaptoethanol , dithiothreitol   and  <dig> % sds  partially influenced the rpoman5a activity, while  <dig> % triton-x  <dig> strongly decreased the rpoman5a activity .table  <dig>

analysis of the hydrolysis products
the hydrolysis products of locust bean gum, konjac glucomannan, and guar gum by rpoman5a were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography . as shown in figure  <dig>  the rpoman5a hydrolyzed various types of mannan polymers, such as galacto-and glucomannans and released various mannose and manno-oligosaccharides. the hydrolysis of locust bean gum yielded mannobiose , mannotriose , and mannopentaose , and other unidentifiable oligosaccharides as the main products . the degradation of konjac glucomannan resulted in the formation of a mixture of mannose and manno-oligosaccharides . mannotriose , mannotetraose , and mannopentaose  were the major products of hydrolysis of guar gum by rpoman5a . the release of mannose required at least  <dig> hours when locust bean gum were used as the substrate, but for konjac glucomannan and guar gum, there is already slight band after  <dig> min.figure  <dig>

discussion
our previous study demonstrated that the p. oxalicum gz- <dig> is a robust hemicellulase-producing fungus during submerged fermentation used agricultural residues as carbon source  <cit> . in this study, a new endo- <dig> -β-mannanase gene from p. oxalicum gz- <dig> was cloned and successfully expressed in pichia pastoris. the gene sequence of endo- <dig> -β-mannosidase showed highest sequence similar  to mannanase from aspergillus aculeatus base on blast on ncbi . the amino acid sequence of endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from p. oxalicum gz- <dig> has 100% identity with the putative endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from penicillium oxalicum 114- <dig>  followed by 71% with the likely endo- <dig> -β-mannosidase from the penicillium roqueforti. an abundance of endo- <dig> -β-mannanases from other fungi genera such as aspergillus and trichoderma have previously been cloned and expressed in pichia pastoris  <cit> . however, only few endo- <dig> -β-mannanases from penicillium genera have been cloned and expressed to date .

based on amino acid sequence similarities, endo- <dig> -β-mannanase has been classified into three families of glycoside hydrolases . most of fungal β-mannanases are predominantly belonging to family  <dig>  and the bacterial β-mannanases belong to gh  <dig> or gh  <dig>  <cit> . homology amino acid sequence comparison with other known fungal gh  <dig> β-mannanases showed that several catalytic active-sites are highly conserved. these features demonstrate that the rpoman5a is a member of the gh <dig>  a cellulose-binding domain  was identified in rpoman5a at the n-terminus when aligned with available protein sequences from the ncbi databases. in gh <dig> fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases, a cbd has been found at either the c-, or n-terminus of some enzymes that contained a catalytic domain . for example, the cbd of trichoderma reesei endo- <dig> -β-mannanase   <cit>  and phanerochaete chrysosporium   <cit>  are located at the c terminus and n terminus, respectively. the cbd play a very important role in the endo- <dig> -β-mannanases activity. the cbd of trichoderma reesei endo- <dig> -β-mannanase has the ability to bind cellulose and increase the hydrolysis rate  <cit> . the endo- <dig> -β-mannanase of aspergillus usamii yl-01- <dig> consists of only a catalytic domain , while a fusion of cbd from the trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase into this enzyme could improve its catalytic activity and/or thermostability  <cit> . however, the mechanism of cbds in catalysis still needs to be explored.

when the recombinant yeast was incubated at 28°c in a  <dig> l shake flask culture, a high level expression of endo- <dig> -β-mannanase was obtained in pichia pastoris . in comparison with other fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanase expression levels in yeast, like bispora sp. mey- <dig> man5a expressed  <dig> mg l− <dig>  <cit> , a. niger endo- <dig> -β-mannanase expressed  <dig> mg ml− <dig>  <cit> , and trichoderma reesei endo- <dig> -β-mannanase expressed  <dig> mg l− <dig>  <cit> , the yield of rpoman5a was superior. the crude supernatant of pichia pastoris showed good activity  and high specific activity , as well as high purity of the crude enzymes. since cultivation experiments were performed in shake flasks which more or less limited the growth of yeast, it will result in considerably higher enzyme yields in a fermenter under controlled and optimized conditions  <cit> . therefore, those features suggested the enzyme has great potential for large-scale production.

the purified rpoman5a showed a single  <dig>  kda protein band on an sds-page , higher than that of the calculated molecular mass of the mature peptide . this may be due to the glycosylation of the expressed protein in pichia pastoris. two putative glycosylation sites in the poman5a amino acid sequence  were predicted by the netnglyc  <dig>  server . the decrease in the molecular mass of rpoman5a was verified by deglycosylation with endo hf on an sds-page . many researchers had observed that the glycosylation of recombinant endo- <dig> -β-mannanase in pichia pastoris was able to obviously increase the molecular mass, such as endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from aspergillus niger bk <dig>  <cit> , man5c <dig> from penicillium pinophilum c <dig>  <cit> , and anman5a from aspergillus niger lw- <dig>  <cit> .

the optimal temperature and ph for the rpoman5a activity was 80°c and ph  <dig> - <dig> , respectively. for most fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases the optimal temperature and ph are between 40-70°c and ph  <dig> - <dig> , respectively  <cit> , such as endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from rhizomucor miehei   <cit> , mani and manii from aspergillus fumigatus imi  <dig>   <cit> , endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from p. oxalicum so   <cit> , endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from a. niger bk <dig>   <cit> , and rman5c <dig> from p. pinophilum c <dig>   <cit> . however, the rpoman5a possesses some superior properties compared to these fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases, such as a long half-life  at high temperatures  and a wide range of ph adaptability  and stability . most fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases were stable at temperatures below 50°c, such as rman5f <dig> from penicillium freii f <dig>   <cit> , recombinant man5xz <dig> from thermophilic fungus thielavia arenaria xz <dig>   <cit> , and recombinant man5xz <dig> from aspergillus nidulans xz <dig> . although rpoman5a was unstable  at ph  <dig> , it exhibited  <dig> % activity at such low ph . in comparison, the endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from aspergillus niger bk <dig> showed only 20% activity at ph  <dig>   <cit> , and rman5c <dig> from p. pinophilum c <dig> likewise lost 80% activity at ph  <dig>   <cit> . many industrial bioprocesses involving enzymes depend on the use of low ph conditions to prevent contamination by other microbes. therefore, rpoman5a has the potential to be used in such processes, where fermentation requires low ph conditions. at its optimal catalytic temperature , rpoman5a was unstable. this characteristic is similar to many other reported fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases  <cit> . the enzyme binding to the substrate could partially stabilize the enzyme conformation, and having no substrate to bind resulted in the loss of enzymatic activity during a thermostability assay  <cit> . therefore, endo- <dig> -β-mannanase showed acidophilic and thermostable characteristics, features that not only increase the rate of hydrolysis but also reduce cost of production in the food industry. consistent with our results, hg2+ has been shown to strongly inhibit other endo- <dig> -β-mannanases  <cit> . inhibition of rpoman5a activity by hg2+ may be due to the oxidation of specific residues containing sulfhydryl groups such as cysteine. the mature protein of rpoman5a has  <dig> cysteine residues. the influence of fe3+ on rpoman5a is similar to other endo- <dig> -β-mannanases  <cit> . the activity of rpoman5a in  <dig> mm reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol and dtt as well as  <dig> % sds remained above 75%. sds has been shown to almost completely inhibit endo- <dig> -β-mannanase activity  <cit> .

the rpoman5a exhibited different activity against various substrates, such as locust bean gum , konjac glucomannan , and guar gum . rmman5a from rhizomucor miehei displayed a same activity order: locust bean gum > konjac glucomannan > guar gum, when used to hydrolyze various mannans  <cit> . locust bean gum is a galactomannan with a high mannose/galactose ratio of 4:1; konjac glucomannan is a glucomannan containing a mannose/glucose ratio of 3: <dig> and guar gum is a galactomannan with mannose/galactose ratio of 2: <dig>  <cit> . the structural differences between these three mannan polymers may lead to various enzymatic activities, when they are used as substrates. there was no enzyme activity detected on  cellulosic substrates, such as beechwood xylan, cmc-na, and filter paper. the cellulase-free characteristic of rpoman5a is in agreement with the most of fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases  <cit> . the cellulase-free characteristic of rpoman5a is valuable for the applications involving bleaching pulp and paper  <cit> . the km value of rpoman5a for locust bean gum  was close to the values obtained for some other fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases, such as rman5f <dig> from penicillium freii f <dig>   <cit> , rman5c <dig> from p. pinophilum c <dig>   <cit> , and man5xz <dig> from thielavia arenaria xz <dig>   <cit> . the km value of rpoman5a for konjac glucomannan and guar gum was 3-fold lower than for locust bean gum.

most endo- <dig> -β-mannanases degrade the backbone of various mannan polysaccharides to produce primarily mannotriose and mannobiose with no mannose. for example, the hydrolysis by endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from aspergillus niger bk <dig> showed that mannobiose was the main product and mannose was not liberated using locust bean gum as substrate  <cit> . however, some endo- <dig> -β-mannanases also released mannose from mannan polymers  <cit> . in this study, the endo- <dig> -β-mannanases whether liberate mannose or not, were dependent on different substrates and hydrolysis time. similar enzymatic properties were reported for rmman5a from rhizomucor miehei  <cit> . the action of the rpoman5a on different substrates indicated that its function was not only as endo-β- <dig> -mannanase but also as a  <dig> -β-mannosidase. an abundance of manno-oligosaccharides primarily containing various oligosaccharides  was obtained from hydrolyzing the inexpensive and widely available locust bean gum and konjac glucomannan by rpoman5a. because monogastric animals cannot effectively digest the mannans and galactomannans into nutritional components, the incorporation of endo- <dig> -β-mannanase into their diets would help them to more easily digest the nutritional elements. thus, rpoman5a has a potential application in the food/feed industries. although the enzyme rpoman5a exhibited attractive biochemical properties like acid-resistant and thermostability, but there is need to explain the mechanisms of its superior properties. the molecular enzyme engineering should be considered to improve the catalytic efficiency and characteristics in the further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a new gene encoding a gh <dig> acidophilic thermostable endo- <dig> -β-mannanase from penicillium oxalicum was cloned and expressed in pichia pastoris. high stability across a broad acidic ph range and thermostability make rpoman5a better suited for many industrial applications in the food/feed and paper/pulp industries compared to most other fungal endo- <dig> -β-mannanases.
