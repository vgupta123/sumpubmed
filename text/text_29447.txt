BACKGROUND
saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses over  <dig> ser/thr protein kinases that have been classified into  <dig> groups  <cit>  . most human protein kinases have orthologues in yeast, including protein kinase a , protein kinase c , akt , calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type ii , 5'-amp activated kinase , cyclin-dependent kinases , mitogen-activated protein kinases , glycogen synthase kinase 3β , p21-activated kinase , polo-like kinase , mixed lineage kinase , and casein kinases  <dig>  and  <dig> . on the other hand, there are no orthologues of the human protein kinase g , phosphorylase kinase , titin, myosin light chain kinase , tousled-like kinase , or any of the protein tyrosine kinases. some dual-function kinases in yeast can phosphorylate tyrosine, usually at the same time as serine/threonine residues  and protein kinase swe1p  <cit> ).

* based on  <cit> .

** there are two protein kinases designated pak1p in s. cerevisiae; in this manuscript, pak1p from group vi_d is referred to as pak1p , while pak1p from group v_c is referred to as prk1p .

a large-scale mass spectrometry-based study of phosphoproteins in a whole-cell lysate of s. cerevisiae detected  <dig> phosphorylation sites in  <dig> phosphopeptide sequences  <cit>  , but the protein kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of these sites have previously remained unknown. we have previously developed methodology to predict the substrates of protein kinases . the predictions are based on the nature of residues located in the substrate-binding pocket at specific positions/distances relative to the conserved motifs found in all ser/thr protein kinase sequences. the approach allows predictions to be made based only on the amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of the kinase. several studies have confirmed predikin predictions experimentally, for example in g-protein-coupled receptor kinase  <cit> , stress-activated protein kinase  <dig>  <cit> , protein kinase c  <cit> , homeodomain-interacting kinase  <cit>  and a tobacco osmotic stress-activated protein kinase  <cit> .

here we used predikin to predict possible associations between the phosphorylation sites identified by ficarro et al.  <cit>  and one or more of the yeast protein kinase. some of these predictions are thought-provoking and suggest areas to investigate further. the study suggests biological functions for uncharacterized protein kinases and substrates, forecasts new signalling connections between known proteins, and provides a basis to direct future experimental work to verify the links between kinases and substrates.

RESULTS
reliability and limitations of the predicted kinase-substrate associations
ficcaro and co-workers attempted to characterise the majority of the phosphoproteins in a whole cell lysate of s. cerevisiae  <cit> . proteins were digested with trypsin, converted to methyl esters, enriched for phosphopeptides with immobilised metal-affinity chromatography , and analyzed by hplc/ electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. a total of  <dig> phosphopeptides were found, corresponding to  <dig> phosphoproteins . it appears that phosphopeptides with more than one phosphorylated residue are enriched in this collection, therefore it may not be entirely representative of the yeast phosphoproteome. we attempted to associate these phosphorylation sites with  <dig> ser/thr protein kinases present in s. cerevisiae , through matching the phosphopeptide sequences with the substrate specificity of each individual kinase as predicted using predikin  <cit> .

we used scansite  <cit>  to assess the quality of the match between the search motif  and the experimentally determined phosphopeptide sequences. to estimate the reliability of the protein kinase- phosphoprotein matches, we performed an analysis of scansite scores for phosphorylation sites where the kinase has been experimentally identified .

scansite scores could be obtained and probabilities estimated for all but  <dig> of the phosphorylation sites in the phosphoproteome dataset; one cannot obtain an accurate score when the phosphorylation site is located too close to the n- or c-terminus of the peptide. the statistics on estimated probabilities are summarized in table  <dig> 

in some cases, two or more kinases were predicted to be equally likely to be associated with a particular phosphopeptide. often, these protein kinases were closely related , although this was not always the case . some sites may in fact be phosphorylated by two or more protein kinases in vivo, particularly by closely related protein kinases. an example of a substrate phosphorylated by two different kinases is the yeast amphiphysin homologue rvs167p, which is phosphorylated both by the cdk pho85p and the mapk fus <dig>  <cit> .

in the cases where both the phosphoprotein and the predicted kinase have characterized functions, correlations between these functions are consistent with and support  our predictions . on several occasions the phosphoproteins scored better with poorly characterized protein kinases than with any better-known ones; such associations could predict functions for these novel proteins.

known protein kinase-substrate pairs
although our associations were predicted without taking into account the available data on the functions of the proteins, the predictions include several examples of protein kinase-substrate pairs for which there is supporting experimental evidence . these include yak1p  <cit>  and sra1p  <cit>  as substrates for tpk1p, and acc1p  <cit>  and pfk2p  <cit>  as substrates for snf1p. the mapks kss1p and fus3p, closely related to hog1p, have been shown to be substrates for ste7p  <cit> . the mapkk pbs2p is known to be a substrate for the mapkkks ssk2p and ssk22p  <cit> , but phosphopeptides corresponding to the known ssk2p and ssk22p phosphorylation sites of pbs2p were not detected by ficarro et al.  <cit> ; the phosphopeptides identified by ficarro et al. map to a different region of pbs2p.

* the phosphorylated residues are underlined, and the residues not present in the phosphopeptide sequences  <cit>  are shown in italic. when there is more than one phosphorylation site, the one discussed is shown in bold, unless the same protein kinase is predicted for all sites in the peptide.

** scansite  <cit>  scores were calculated as described in the methods section. when the same protein kinase is predicted for all sites in the peptide, the scores are given for the respective sites, starting at the n-terminus. if more than one protein kinase yields a similar score, all the possible kinases are listed.

*** probabilities were calculated as described in the methods section . when the same protein kinase is predicted for all sites in the peptide, the values are given for the respective sites, starting at the n-terminus.

less direct experimental evidence has previously suggested the association of several other predicted kinase-substrate pairs . for example, bni5p is a part of a multi-protein complex involving the protein kinase gin4p and the septins, and the protein kinase cdc28p is required for the association of gin4p with the septins  <cit> . overexpression of gpd1p reduces the hypersensitivity to osmotic shock of a hypersensitive yeast mutant, presumably due to the effect on signalling through the protein kinase c-mapk pathway involving bck1p; the over-expression of bck1p similarly restored the protein kinase c signalling to the same mutant and rescued its hypersensitivity to osmotic shock  <cit> . the protein kinase ume5p  is known to be involved in the transcriptional repression of the hsp <dig> gene  <cit> . msn2p is a protein kinase pkc1p-regulated transcription factor  <cit> . inactivation of the protein kinase yak1p and overexpression of sok2p have similar effects on yeast defective in protein kinase a signalling  <cit> , suggesting that phosphorylation by yak1p could have an inhibitory effect on sok2p. the inactivation of protein kinases hog1p and ssd1p have similar effects on mutants deficient in the protein phosphatase activators rrd1p and rrd2p  <cit> . finally, mutation of the gene encoding the protein kinase fus3p  enhances the mating defect of some ste <dig> mutants; the deletion of ste <dig> is completely sterile, therefore these are weak alleles of ste <dig>  <cit> . the available experimental evidence for all these predicted associations supports the reliability of our predictions in general.

predicted kinase-substrate pairs showing functional correlations
in addition to the known kinase-substrate pairs, our predicted associations feature a number of pairs consistent with the known roles for the kinase and the substrate . indeed, none of our predicted associations involve proteins with functions that are clearly incompatible. the functions of some associated proteins do not show obvious relationships, but instead suggest cross-connections between different cellular pathways. for example, seemingly unrelated processes such as mitosis in growing cells or sporulation/meiosis in starved non-growing cells involve common processes such as chromosome segregation and new cell wall deposition. our associations provide a number of proposed functional links that can now be experimentally tested. the following examples are representative of the correlated functions in substrate-kinase pairs in the dataset .

protein kinase ck <dig> with roles in endocytosis and cytokinesis is predicted to be associated with a number of proteins involved in endocytosis, including ede1p, a key endocytic protein that binds membranes in a ubiquitin-dependent manner and is involved in a network of interactions with endocytic proteins, the sh <dig> domain-containing protein ysc84p, and the actin cytoskeletal protein pan1p involved in actin cortical actin patch formation. ck <dig> phosphorylation of receptor cytoplasmic tails  <cit>  is required for subsequent ubiquitination of flanking lysines by rsp5p  <cit>  and receptor endocytosis. ubiquitination by rsp5p of endocytic machinery appears to be required too, as fusion of the receptor cytoplasmic tail to ubiquitin bypasses the requirement for ubiquitination of the receptor cytoplasmic tail, but does not bypass the requirement for rsp5p in endocytosis per se  <cit> . also, rsp5p physically interacts with sla1p  <cit> , which in turn interacts with ysc84p  <cit>  and pan1p  <cit> . furthermore, rsp <dig> genetically interacts with ede <dig>  <cit> . therefore, there is a possibility that ck <dig> phosphorylation of ede1p, ysc84p, and pan1p is required for their subsequent rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination on flanking lysines, analogous to what has been shown for receptor cytoplasmic tails. it is not known yet if these proteins are ubiquitinated by rsp5p; rvs167p is a component of the endocytic machinery that is known to be ubiquitinated by rsp5p  <cit> , but it has not been detected among the phosphopeptides. rvs167p is in a complex with sla1p and rsp5p  <cit>  so other sla1p interactors such as ysc84p and pan1p are strong possibilities for rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination; moreover, the mammalian pan1p orthologue eps <dig> is known to be ubiquitinated  <cit> . a model for the regulation of endocytosis by ck1-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination is shown in figure  <dig> 

ck <dig> is also predicted to phosphorylate the rab gtpase sec4p essential for exocytosis  <cit> . one yeast ck <dig>  has been shown to regulate rab-gtpase dependent vacuole fusion  <cit> . some endocytic cytoskeletal proteins . at this stage of the cell cycle cortical actin patches transiently redistribute throughout the mother cell and bud, thus losing their polarisation. the cytoplasmic actin cables become randomly oriented in the mother cell and bud during m phase. finally, upon exit from mitosis and reduction of cdc28p activity, the cortical actin patches in the mother cell and the bud align on either side of the bud neck. cytoplasmic actin cables align with their tips on either side of the bud neck. after cell division is complete and the cells enter early g <dig>  the cortical actin patches again adopt a random distribution and the cytoplasmic actin cables become randomly oriented.

abp1p is an actin-binding protein that specifically localises to cortical actin patches  <cit> . crn1p also localises to cortical actin patches and is thought to act as a linker between these patches and microtubules  <cit> . both abp1p and crn1p bind to the arp2/ <dig> complex, a multi-subunit complex that mediates the nucleation step of actin filament assembly within the cortical actin patch. cortical actin patches are highly motile and short-lived structures. they form by de novo actin filament assembly at polarised sites on the cortex where arp2/ <dig> activators concentrate. hence their polarisation during the cell cycle is thought to reflect polarisation of the sites where they form. once assembled, cortical actin patches move rapidly away from these cortical sites and into the body of the cell. this rapid movement is thought to be propelled by the force generated by de novo actin filament assembly. one of the arp2/ <dig> activators implicated in cortical actin patch assembly at the cortex and actin-dependent movement is abp1p  <cit> . abp1p binds to and activates the arp2/ <dig> complex and thus stimulates de novo assembly of actin filaments. crn1p also binds the arp2/ <dig> complex. however, in contrast to abp1p, crn1p binding to the arp2/ <dig> complex inhibits  arp2/ <dig> activity, in part by preventing arp2/ <dig> activation by abp1p  <cit> . hence, both abp1p and crn1p regulate cortical actin patch formation and dynamics. the association of cdc28p with abp1p and crn1p predicted in this study suggests an important role for these two cortical actin patch components in the response of the cortical actin patches to intrinsic cues generated by cdc28p, the cell cycle regulatory kinase.

a large proportion of yeast proteins are implicated directly or indirectly in functions such as carbohydrate metabolism, stress, and cell growth. the pairs glycogen synthase kinase mds1p  – chaperone hsp26p as substrate, and the protein kinase yfl033cp  – trehalase nth1p as substrate have common roles in stress response. the protein kinase sha3p  and the predicted substrate, the high affinity glucose transporter hxt2p, share roles in hexose transport, while the ampk snf1p and the predicted substrates, the putative regulator of protein phosphatase- <dig> shp1p, and the regulatory subunit of trehalose-6-phosphate/synthase/phosphatase complex tps3p, are all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. other novel kinase-substrate pairs are also predicted in processes including autophagy, dna replication and transcription, mitosis and cell cycle, the cytoskeleton, nitrogen utilization, sporulation and cellular growth and morphogenesis .

there are several instances of phosphopeptides from protein kinases in the dataset that may indicate protein kinase cascades. mapks are indeed identified as mapkk  substrates . the other examples include protein kinases cla4p , ctk1p , npr1p , pbs2p , sgv1p , spc98p , yak1p , and the uncharacterized ydr466wp .

prediction of function for novel phosphoproteins and kinases
several associations are predicted between a protein with a known function and a protein with an unknown function. putative functional annotations of uncharacterised proteins through such associations represent an intriguing result of this study.

the associations suggest a functional role for a number of uncharacterised protein kinases . the kinase akl1p, while uncharacterised, is in the same family as ark1p and prk1p, both of which regulate the actin cytoskeleton, and may function in transcriptional regulation, the cell cycle and cell growth-related processes. the kinase ksp1p, while uncharacterised, is highly homologous to mark <dig>  in mammals, predicted to function in microtubule cytoskeleton, stress response and polyamine transport. the predictions implicate kin4p in ph regulation, kns1p in mating, ksp1p in phospholipid metabolism, ygl179cp in pyruvate metabolism, yjl057cp in transcription, ypk2p in amino acid transport, meiosis and cell growth, and ypr106wp in stress response and trna processing.

conversely, the predicted kinases suggest functional roles for a number of phosphoproteins . for example, protein kinases pbs2p, prk1p and ssk2p jointly implicate the common putative substrate yhr186cp  in actin organization. yhr186cp is a component of the torc complex involving tor1p or tor2p; tor2p is a known regulator of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . protein kinases rck1p and ck <dig> jointly implicate yhr097cp in meiosis, while the kinases cdc28p and mps1p jointly suggest a role in mitosis for yml072cp. bre5p, mlf3p, yfr016cp and yro2p may have a role in the cell cycle, mrh1p in transcription and regulation of meiosis and mitosis, ydl189wp in meiosis, ydr090cp in actin and cell wall organization, ynl136wp in actin filament organization and stress response, ymr196wp and yor175cp in stress response, ycr023cp, yfr017cp, yhr132wp, yml029wp, ymr295cp, yor042wp and yor052cp in cell growth processes, yfr024cp in amino acid biosynthesis, ynl156cp and ynl321wp in cytokinesis, and ypl247cp in endocytosis.

phosphorylation of several sites on the same protein by the same kinase
the predicted association between the kinase-substrate pair may be stronger in the cases where the same kinase is predicted to phosphorylate two or more distinct sites on the same protein . examples of such a kinase-substrate pair are ck1-ede1p  and ck1-tat1p. ck <dig> is implicated in endocytosis and tat2p  levels are regulated in response to starvation by endocytosis  <cit> .

* protein kinases yck1p, yck2p, yck3p or hrr25p. the predicted specificities are identical.

** protein kinases cka1p, cka2p or cdc7p. the predicted specificities are too similar to be distinguished.

autophosphorylation
while autophosphorylation may be common in yeast cells, there are only a few protein kinases represented in the phosphoproteome dataset , incorporating  <dig> phosphorylation sites. for  <dig> of these sites, the specificity of the kinase is quite different from the phosphorylation site, suggesting autophosphorylation is unlikely. autophosphorylation is most likely in the case of akl1p, a protein kinase of unknown function from family v_c. this prediction is consistent with yeast two-hybrid analysis  <cit> . the phosphorylation site  is c-terminal to the protein kinase domain  and is distinct from the activation loop threonine , therefore unlikely to involve an auto-activation event. in two other cases involving cla4p and pbs2p, autophosphorylation is a possibility, although the phosphorylation sites better match specificities of other yeast kinases. it should be kept in mind that the sequences of autophosphorylation sites can deviate substantially from the usual specificity of the kinase, as a result of the effect of high local concentration during an autophosphorylation reaction  <cit> .

tyrosine phosphorylation
although fungi have no protein kinases classified as protein tyrosine kinases, phospho-tyrosine residues are found in yeast  <cit> . an early example is the protein kinase spk1p , which can phosphorylate proteins on ser, thr and tyr residues, and can phosphorylate poly  <cit> . in fact, protein chip experiments showed that  <dig> yeast kinases can phosphorylate poly  <cit> , although the physiological relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation by most of these kinases is not yet clear. currently it is accepted that tyr phosphorylation in yeast is due to dual specificity protein kinases that can phosphorylate tyrosine in tandem with a nearby threonine  <cit> ; they cannot phosphorylate solitary tyr residues. there are two classes of dual specificity protein kinases in yeast. the first are the mapkks  that phosphorylate txy motifs in the activation loop of mapks . the phosphorylation events are carried out in order, with the tyr phosphorylation occurring first, the thr phosphorylation occurring second  <cit> . in our dataset, the topoisomerase-associated protein, pat1p, has both ser and tyr phosphorylated in a sxy motif, which may be the result of mapkk phosphorylation, or the s6k-like protein kinase ynr047wp , followed by mapkk phosphorylation. another example of a dual specificity kinase is swe1p that phosphorylates both residues at ty sites in cdks. cdc28p , is a known substrate for swe1p   <cit> . no occurrences of dually-phosphorylated ty motifs are present in the phosphoproteome dataset we used.

correlations with comprehensive protein association studies in yeast
several groups attempted comprehensive analyses of protein-protein associations in s. cerevisiae . a mass spectrometry-based study  <cit>  included  <dig> yeast protein kinases and  <dig> proteins from the phosphoproteome dataset as bait proteins. associations were demonstrated  between hrr25p and ede1p, and between rad53p and ede1p ; between ksp1p and yhr186cp ; between kss1p and ste11p, between bck1p and hog1p , and between prk1p with akl1p . another mass spectrometry-based study  <cit>  revealed the associations between chd1p and ck2-type protein kinases cka1p and cka2p , between pkc1p and eno1p , and between sec31p and both cka1p and cka2p .

it is not surprising that many protein kinase – substrate pairs cannot be detected as protein-protein complexes, because of the temporary nature of the interaction. the protein association studies using yeast two hybrid methodology  <cit>  would be expected to reveal more short-term associations than affinity capture-based approaches. a study by ito and co-workers  <cit>  included a set of  <dig> s. cerevisiae protein kinases as bait,  <dig> protein kinases as prey, and one kinase as both. only one pair of associated proteins involved a protein kinase and a protein from the phosphoproteome, protein kinase ypr106wp  and the protein chs2p ; the association is consistent with our prediction. only one association with a kinase has been identified in the study by uetz et al.  <cit>  .

in summary, few predicted kinase-substrate pairs are supported by comprehensive protein-protein interaction studies. the likely reasons include poor representation of protein kinases and proteins in the phosphoproteome dataset in these studies, and the temporary nature of the kinase-substrate interaction that may be difficult to detect by the methods used in these studies.

very recently, proteome chip technology has been used to identify the in vitro substrates for  <dig> unique yeast protein kinases, using yeast proteome microarrays containing ~ <dig>  proteins  <cit> . this study identified candidate kinases for  <dig> proteins from the phosphoproteome dataset we used here  <cit> . significantly, this study confirmed in  <dig> cases that our predicted kinases phosphorylate the substrates in vitro, and additionally in  <dig> more cases closely related kinases were shown to phosphorylate the substrates.

representation of different kinase groups among the set of kinases responsible for phosphorylation in the phosphoproteome dataset
the phosphopeptide sequences in the dataset suggest that all  <dig> major groups of kinases are represented among the kinases responsible for their phosphorylation . however, not all the individual protein kinases are represented in our predictions . there are a number of protein kinases that have apparently phosphorylated a number of the proteins in the dataset, while others are absent altogether. the most frequent kinases to be predicted to phosphorylate sites in the phosphoproteome are the yeast orthologues of mammalian pka, camk <dig>  ampk, ck <dig>  ck <dig>  and members of the cdk, mapk and clk families. along with pkc, these are the protein kinases that are known to perform housekeeping functions within the cell. we may have been unable to predict all pkc1p-substrate associations because some pkc1p-phosphorylated sequences may differ considerably from the optimal pkc1p phosphorylation consensus motif, and may also fit phosphorylation consensus motifs for other protein kinases .

many protein kinases are linked to specific cellular responses and may only be induced under specific circumstances, and are therefore not necessarily represented in our dataset. examples of such cellular responses include double-stranded dna break repair, starvation and mating. the yeast cells used in the study by ficarro et al. were from a normal growing culture  <cit>  .

a survey of the functions of the proteins represented in the yeast phosphoproteome shows components of fundamental cellular structures and machines , intermediary metabolism, endocytosis, cytokinesis, transport proteins, permeases and transcription factors. it is reasonable to imagine that the represented proteins that are as yet uncharacterized will function in these processes; a similar argument can be made for the associated protein kinases that have unknown functions. these kinases often have specificities similar to the better-studied kinases. our predicted associations are generally consistent with these conclusions.

implications for human protein kinases
few of the proteins in the yeast phosphoproteome dataset have sequences containing the phosphorylation sites conserved in human proteins; many of these proteins do have human homologues, but the phosphorylation site, which is often located near the n- or c-terminus of the protein, has diverged. this observation suggests that the exact location of the phosphorylation site may often be unimportant as a determinant of the regulatory pathway, and that the intricacies of the regulatory mechanisms may differ among species. the following examples illustrate the different cases of conservation between the yeast and human proteins.

in some cases, the sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites are well conserved, suggesting an equivalent kinase may be responsible for the phosphorylation events in both organisms. examples include the α-subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase , and glycogen synthase . neither of the human proteins is known to be phosphorylated at these positions. the yeast mapk hog1p and its human orthologue both require double phosphorylation by a mapkk at a tgy motif  <cit> . the similarity of the two sequences suggests an equivalent mapkk is likely to be responsible in both organisms.

in other cases, the phosphorylated residue appears to be conserved, but the surrounding sequence has diverged to the extent that a protein kinase with a different specificity would be required in the two organisms. one such example involves yeast ace2p  and its human orthologue klf <dig>  the residues corresponding to the phosphorylated ser <dig> and ser <dig> in yeast bud4p are ser and glu in the human orthologue claspin; if claspin ser <dig>  was phosphorylated, it would require a protein kinase with a different specificity for phosphorylation, while the glu provides a constitutive negative charge. human enolase similarly has a glutamic acid in place of the yeast eno1p phospho-ser <dig> 

there are cases where both the yeast and human orthologous proteins are known to be regulated by phosphorylation, but the mechanisms do not appear to be strictly conserved. protein kinase snf <dig> was predicted in this study to be responsible for phosphorylation of acc1p  at ser <dig>  human acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase is known to be phosphorylated by ampk at ser <dig>  <cit> . while the two serines are located in similar regions in their respective proteins, they do not strictly align  <cit> . similarly, the regulatory subunit of pka is a substrate for its catalytic subunit in both s. cerevisiae and mammalian proteins  <cit> . again, the phosphorylated residue is in a similar location in the sequence, but they do not strictly align.

however, in many cases the region of the protein phosphorylated in yeast is poorly conserved in humans, or the equivalent region of the protein does not exist in the human protein. for example, in the human orthologue of the yeast protein sec4p, the n-terminal phosphorylation sites are missing, while the c-terminal sites have diverged in sequence. the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation sites in yeast protein abp1p is well conserved in the human orthologue mabp <dig>  <cit> ; however, the residues equivalent to the phosphorylated thr <dig> and ser <dig> have been substituted by amino acids other than ser or thr.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we aimed to associate every phosphorylation site in the yeast phosphoproteome reported in the literature  <cit>  with the protein kinase most likely to be responsible for phosphorylation of that site. our approach made use of the computer program predikin, which is the only computational method that is able to shed light on the specificity of uncharacterized protein kinases  <cit> . the accuracy of predikin-based predictions has been demonstrated previously using an experimental cross-validation set  <cit> . moreover, several subsequent experimental confirmations of novel predikin predictions have been reported  <cit> . as part of the present work, we also estimated the probabilities of individual predictions. we identified a possible kinase for most phosphorylation sites in the phosphoproteome dataset, more than half of the associations showing high probabilities. certain classes of protein kinases have well-defined substrate specificities that make the associations more reliable; these include kinases in the agc, camk, cmgc, mapkk and ck <dig> groups. because the phosphoproteome has been determined using yeast cells not subjected to any particular challenge, it is not surprising that certain groups of protein kinases such as the checkpoint kinases, were not predicted to be responsible for phosphorylation of any substrate in the dataset. on the other hand, housekeeping enzymes such as protein kinases ck <dig> and ck <dig> appear to have a number of substrates in the phosphoproteome dataset, supporting fundamental and constitutive roles in cell regulation for these kinases. our analysis has created a foundation on which to base future experimental work, e.g. the effects of depletion or over-expression of the associated kinase on phosphorylation of the predicted substrate.
