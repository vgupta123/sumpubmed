BACKGROUND
understanding how we might replace damaged and diseased tissue through the use of stem cell based therapies is an important goal for biomedical science. despite natural occurrences that occur across the animal kingdom and work in a growing number of systems, regeneration is still poorly understood. model systems are starting to shed light on the molecular processes that orchestrate various regenerative phenomena  <cit> . among the various systems, planarians have a distinct advantage of being able to regenerate entire animals from small starting fragments . to what extent this is due to novel mechanisms unique to planarians is unknown. the simple anatomy and highly accessible adult stem cell system of planarian flatworms make it a high value model system from which we can hope to form valuable paradigms for how regeneration is controlled.

regenerative potential in these animals is dependent on a population of cycling pluripotent adult stem cells present throughout the parenchyma, except in the area in front of the photoreceptors and the region of the pharynx . on wounding or amputation these adult stem cells undergo two characteristic peaks of cell division that produce stem cell progeny and can subsequently differentiate to replace missing or damaged tissue  <cit> . the amenability of planarians, and in particular the planarian schmidtea mediterranea to functional genomic approaches in combination with advances in sequencing technology has produced several gene expression and transcriptomic studies on head regeneration  <cit> , wounding  <cit> , and neoblast dynamics .

planarians are able to reconstitute the full adult body plan from very different starting scenarios. for example tail stump pieces will regenerate a new head, head pieces a new tail and trunk fragments both a head and a tail. in addition to all these potentially different regenerative scenarios, the planarian must also rescale and remodel the morphology of pre-existing tissues and organs to fit the size of the animals and to ensure sufficient functional integration  <cit> . thus from very different beginnings all fragments converge to the same end point. this means that any starting fragment contains the information required to reconstitute the whole adult body. while we already know a little about some of the key events in this process, for example the signalling pathways that are required to ensure the correct polarity along the different axes of regenerating pieces, we still lack an understanding of how these events fit together globally .

in this study we have amalgamated existing transcriptomes  <cit>  to provide an improved resource as a service to the research community. this exercise includes re-annotation of transcripts, removal of likely chimeric transcripts and characterisation of transcripts that code for proteins novel to the phylum platyhelminthes and/or the intensely studied triclad group of planarians.

using this new meta-transcriptome assembly we looked to investigate the potential for genome wide expression analysis for understanding differences and similarities in the regulatory program that underpins different regenerative scenarios. we investigated head and tail regeneration of the planarian schmidtea mediterranea from  <dig> to  <dig> hours after amputation. using this wealth of data, we were able to describe patterns of gene expression levels during regeneration across the whole transcriptome and perform comparisons between regeneration time-points and scenarios. this allowed us to describe the transcriptional changes that reflect key regulatory transitions during the regenerative process.

we found that head regeneration  and tail regeneration  transcriptomes initially reflect the differences in cellular content at the beginning of regeneration. they then diverge further over the first  <dig> hours of regeneration. however, we observed an unexpected convergence of expression profiles by  <dig> hours of regeneration between these two contrasting scenarios. this divergent/convergent pattern was underpinned by a core battery of more than  <dig>  genes that are regulated in the same manner during between 6- <dig> hours of head regeneration and 36- <dig> hours of tail regeneration.

both to internally validate our data at the genome wide level and to further define those genes that can be associated specifically with anterior regeneration we performed rna-seq in the background of the well characterised smed-prep phenotype, which specifically results in the loss of anterior structures  <cit> . this allowed the identification of putative direct and indirect targets of smed-prep which were enriched among those genes we found to be involved in the shared regulatory transition.

from blast annotations against selected species, we were able to define lists of genes that are potentially unique to s. mediterranea, unique within the tricladida  <cit> , and unique to the phylum platyhelminthes. we found that differentially expressed transcripts during regeneration were enriched for triclad specific transcripts. these transcripts are potentially involved in novel mechanisms underpinning potent regenerative capacity, and suggest that as has been recently suggested in urodeles, some important aspects of regeneration may be lineage specific  <cit> . our data provide new insight into the regulatory logic of regeneration, and act as a reference point against which to advance our understanding of the regulatory control of regeneration.

RESULTS
consolidation of the available transcriptome data
there are currently five independently assembled s mediterranea transcriptomes with sufficient read depth and coverage to have aspirations to providing whole transcriptome coverage  <cit> . it is unclear in the literature to what extent, if at all, later assemblies have used data from earlier sources. we decided against a reassembly from the raw sequencing data that went into the  <dig> independent assemblies due to the varying error profiles of the raw data from different library preparation and sequencing chemistry. in addition, not all data was readily available and/or described fully in the repositories. we gathered the available transcriptome data from the  <dig> relevant publications  along with the available est datasets and performed a consolidation of the transcripts. we chose to include only  <dig> of the  <dig> available transcriptomes because the dataset provided by abril et al. contained a high number of contigs  suggesting a highly fragmented assembly  <cit> . we did not want to introduce more variability into the consolidation.

the consolidation process seeks to retain a high confidence set of transcripts, resolve transcript fusion events, and retain transcripts with the longest open reading frames. we first clustered transcripts from all  <dig> datasets by sequence similarity using cap <dig> assembler  <cit> . each assembled contig can be represented as a cluster with contributing transcripts from one of the  <dig> data sources. we kept only clusters that had transcripts from at least  <dig> different sources to ensure a high confidence set of transcripts resulting in  <dig>  clusters. we then removed potential fusion transcripts from each cluster by analysing the position of top blast hits along the cluster length to complete proteome sets. removal of potential fusion transcripts split  <dig> clusters into  <dig>  clusters. to retain the sequence with the longest orf for each cluster, we took the transcript or cap <dig> contig with the longest orf in each cluster.

to make sure we are including known s. mediterranea transcripts that might not be in the  <dig> transcriptomes due to low expression, we blasted the consolidated transcripts to  <dig> known s. mediterranea mrna sequences.  <dig> transcripts were not found in the consolidated transcriptome including genes with very low expression levels or very localised expression patterns  and many neuropeptide pro-hormones with restricted expression patterns  <cit> . these data are indicative that genes with expression restricted to small populations of cells may well have escaped current sequencing efforts.

a detailed description of the process is available as a additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> containing all relevant scripts and details. the consolidated transcriptome contains  <dig>  transcripts of which,  <dig>  are unmodified transcripts taken from one of the transcriptome sources and the remaining  <dig>  transcripts are assembled cap <dig> contigs. a comparison of average transcript length and n <dig> length to the  <dig> transcriptomes shows a substantial length increase with respect to both transcript length and open reading frame  length . we also assessed transcriptome coverage by blasting each transcriptome to the core eukaryotic gene mapping approach  database  <cit>  which contains a core set of genes found in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. the consolidated transcriptome had hits to  <dig> cegma genes out of a possible  <dig> and a significantly larger ortholog hit ratio of  <dig>  compared to the  <dig> transcriptomes .figure  <dig>

overall our analyses show that a simple consolidation of the extant published data provides an improved high confidence s. mediterranea transcriptome with respect to representation, total length and coding potential. this will be of significance for future genome wide expression analyses exploiting this important model system.

a gene expression time-course of anterior and posterior regeneration
planarian regeneration is able to confidently restore whole individuals, with all organs scaled to the correct size from any starting piece  <cit> . thus from very different beginnings, the same end result is obtained. in the first instance we wished to understand how this process is reflected in whole transcriptome gene expression changes. one would expect early expression profiles to be very different depending on the cell and tissue contents, for example brain and neural tissues in the head versus gut tissues in the tail. the expression profiles should eventually converge as the missing tissues are regenerated.

our goal was to describe these trajectories from different starting scenarios to obtain an overview of which genes are differentially expressed during the first  <dig> hours of regeneration. we hypothesised that differentially expressed genes would represent the unique regulatory solutions each regenerative scenario uses to arrive at the reconstitution of a whole animal. to this end we performed transcriptome sequencing on regenerating head and tail fragments at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after amputation.

in total,  <dig> , <dig> reads were mapped to the transcriptome across replicate samples at each regeneration time-point in each of the two scenarios. on average, the correlation between replicate samples was  <dig> . while having  <dig> replicates for each time-point/fragment is not ideal for modelling the variance encountered in rna-seq, our sample preparation of including multiple individuals  does offer some variance stabilization through biological averaging. having more replicates would add more resolution to our individual transcript expression profiles, but for the purpose of observing global trends in expression, we resorted to statistical optimizations of filtering our dataset more stringently and setting a higher adjusted p-value threshold.

we filtered our raw count data for transcripts that had less than  <dig> reads mapping in all libraries, leaving us with  <dig>  transcripts for differential expression analysis. we performed differential expression analysis with edger  <cit>  on pairs of consecutive time-points  and also on pairs of fragments at the same time-point . the significance threshold for differential expression was set at p-value of  <dig>  .figure  <dig> 
differential expression during head/tail regeneration and head vs tail regeneration. differential expression performed with edger was done on consecutive time-points during head and tail regeneration  and also between head and tail expression profiles at the same time-points. a) head regeneration time-course showing the number of differentially expressed transcripts at p-value <  <dig>  and  <dig> different fold changes. positive numbers represent the number of transcripts that are up-regulated between two time-points and negative numbers represents down-regulation. b) tail regeneration time-course showing the number of differentially expressed transcripts at p-value <  <dig>  and  <dig> different fold changes. c) differential expression between head and tail fragments during regeneration at p-value of  <dig>  and  <dig> different fold changes.



the largest number of differentially expressed transcripts during head and tail regeneration are  <dig>  transcripts down-regulated from 6- <dig> hours in heads and  <dig>  transcripts down-regulated from 36- <dig> hours in tails . we will refer to lists of differentially expressed transcripts by their abbreviated fragment type and time-period. for example, transcripts down-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> hours in head fragments will be abbreviated as h6-12-down. we also observed that between fragments there is considerable increase in differentially up-regulated transcripts in both head and tail fragments between  <dig> and  <dig> hours. . this increase hints at a divergence of expression profiles between head and tail regeneration starting at  <dig> hours and ending after  <dig> hours. this divergence may be representative of a differential program utilized by head and tail fragments. at higher fold-changes, there are also more transcripts up-regulated in tail fragments compared to head fragments between  <dig> and  <dig> hours suggesting that tail fragments undergoes a more drastic expression regulation during the divergence than head fragments. a possible reason for this may be that tail fragments need to regenerate a brain which contains a rich population of genes and isoforms.

overall our data set describes the transcriptome of head and tail fragments during the first  <dig> hours of regeneration. this time-course data reflects the processes of regenerating new tissues in addition to remodelling existing tissue since whole fragments were used instead of just the regenerating blastema. this dataset presents a valuable resource for data mining the transcriptional behaviour of planarians genes during regeneration.

head and tail fragment enriched transcripts implicates genes involved in early anterior and posterior regeneration
as a simple validation of our expression data, we looked for head and tail enriched transcripts by comparing head and tail fragments at  <dig> hours, immediately after amputation. we were able to find many known anterior markers  and posterior markers  enriched in head and tail piecess respectively . we also find many membrane voltage gated channels and neurotransmitter receptors involved in nervous system function, metalloproteinases, and several homeobox genes  in head enriched transcripts. we will refer to head and tail enriched transcripts at the beginning of regeneration as f-head and f-tail .table  <dig>

we expected head and tail enriched transcripts to be representative of the existing anterior/posterior tissues. f-head and f-tail should be consistently up-regulated in their respective fragments until remodelling of the existing tissues occurs. we looked at the expression profile of these head and tail enriched transcripts during regeneration and found f-head transcripts to be consistently up-regulated in heads compared to tail fragments at the same time-points suggesting remodelling does not occur within the first  <dig> hours of head regeneration. in contrast, for tail enriched transcripts, there is a down-regulation in tail fragments at  <dig> hours  suggesting remodelling is taking place at this time.figure  <dig>

there is also a slight up-regulation of head enriched transcripts during early tail regeneration that might reflect the development of the early brain structure shown previously to occur in anterior facing wounds  <cit> . we found  <dig> transcripts out of a total  <dig>  head enriched transcripts are up-regulated in tail fragments at  <dig> hours compared to  <dig> hours. among these are several s. mediterranea transcripts involved in anterior development  and transcripts known to be expressed anteriorly  . this group of  <dig> genes could be important in the early regeneration of anterior stuctures. interestingly there are also several metalloproteinases  which have been implicated in neural tissue remodelling and cell migration in this list. however, early brain structures have previously been shown to develop in the blastema, not existing tissues and we also do not observe remodelling until  <dig> hours suggesting the function of mmps at the stage is perhaps confined only to the blastema tissues or a small portion of the existing tissue.table  <dig>

a shared regulatory program between head and tail regeneration
we performed a hierarchical clustering of expression profiles using correlation distance on all libraries to observe when tail and head regeneration diverges . the clustering generated two separate groups of expression profiles  from  <dig> hours in heads and  <dig> hours in tails indicative of an early divergence in expression profiles. surprisingly, we observed a subsequent convergence of expression profiles at  <dig> hours indicated by the blue cluster, grouping heads and tail fragments at  <dig> and  <dig> hours.figure  <dig> 
hierarchical clustering of sample libraries. a hierarchical clustering performed using correlation distance and complete linkage was done on the filtered, normalized, and standardized counts for each library. the resulting clusters indicate a divergence of expression profiles between head and tail regeneration at  <dig> hours and a subsequent convergence of expression profiles at  <dig> hours.



this convergence suggest both head and tail fragments reach a similar regenerative state at the transcriptome level as early as  <dig> hours. at this time point tails will have just formed cephalic ganglia tissue and started to form the beginnings of the photoreceptors  <cit> . nonetheless, we found this convergence surprising, as head and tail fragments are still morphologically distinct at this early stage. together this suggested to us that much of the similarity of expression levels might represent underlying gene regulatory and cellular behaviours rather than the formation of equivalent tissues.

to investigate the convergence further we looked for shared batteries of genes between differentially regulated genes at each time point . the most significant overlapping regulatory programs with a hypergeometric p-value of effectively  <dig> were observed for  <dig> differentially expressed lists: h6-12-down and t36-48-down , h6-12-up and t36-48-up . we conclude that the h6- <dig> regulatory transition is primarily responsible for the early divergence of expression profiles between head and tail fragments and the subsequent convergence at  <dig> hours is caused by tails going through a very similar regulatory transition during t36- <dig> . we will refer to the shared regulatory program between h6- <dig> and t36- <dig> as o and we will refer the shared up/down-regulation program as o-up and o-down.figure  <dig>

o-up and o-down both represent approximately one third of transcripts assessed for differential expression. we found  <dig> potential transcription factors out of a total  <dig> potential transcription factors in our data set were present in o-down and  <dig> in o-up. known s. mediterranea transcript factors found in o-down include smed-prep, smed-dlx, smed-gata, smed-prox <dig>  and smed-six. in o-up, we found smed-junli, smed-tcf <dig>  smed-e2f-like.

there are more transcripts up/down-regulated in t36- <dig> compared to h6- <dig>  91% of the transcripts in h6-12-down overlap with 52% of transcripts in t36-48-down and  <dig> % of h6-12-up transcripts overlap with 49% of t36-48-up transcripts meaning there are  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts that are exclusively regulated  in t36-48-down and t36-48-up. while these transcripts were not found to be differentially expressed at h6- <dig>  they still conform to the convergence of expression profile at  <dig> hours . instead of being sharply regulated during h6- <dig>  these transcripts gradually up/down-regulate during head regeneration to eventually match tail expression level at  <dig> hours.figure  <dig>

together our analysis reveals a previously unknown shared regulatory program between two very different regenerative scenarios. this program includes a large proportion of the genome and runs at different times and scenarios. this gives us for the first time insight into how whole body regeneration is regulated and suggests that different regenerative scenarios may use a core regenerative program that is activated after scenario specific events have occurred. future work investigating an even wider set of regenerative scenarios will test this model, but the use of shared program between the opposite scenarios investigates here is strongly suggestive this is the case. this program is likely to represent key shared events, such as elaboration of axial fates, replacement of major tissues such as the gut  <cit> , excretory system and nervous system and re-establishment of the stem cell and stem cell progeny populations  <cit> , and remodelling of existing tissues to their correct proportions.

smed-prep disrupts the expression of transcripts found in the two major regulatory events during regeneration
smed-prep is a tale class homeodomain gene that has been found to be required for anterior fate and patterning during regeneration  <cit> . upon rnai knock-down of smed-prep, regenerating tail fragments fail to develop a discernible anterior compartment. in order to provide a genome wide validation of our time-course dataset and to investigate possible down-stream genes regulated directly or indirectly by smed-prep, we performed rna-seq on tail fragments of smed-prep animals  <dig> hours after amputation along with gfp dsrna injected controls at the same time-point. we will refer to this  <dig> hour tail fragment comparison between gfp and smed-prep animals as p. transcripts down and up regulated in response to smed-prep will be referred to as p-down and p-up.

we generated two lists of differentially expressed transcripts for p-down and p-up at a fold-change of  <dig> or more. there are  <dig>  transcripts in p-up and  <dig> in p-down. the larger number of transcripts up-regulated in response to smed-prep versus down-regulation suggest a direct or indirect transcriptional repressive role of smed-prep.

as a validation of our smed-prep data, we looked at whether f-head transcripts are affected by smed-prep. we found  <dig> f-head transcripts in p-down and  <dig> in p-up. while there are some voltage gated channels and neurotransmitter transcripts in these lists, no known s. mediterranea transcripts were found and only two transcription factors were found in both p-down and f-head . this result was to be expected as f-head transcripts are not up-regulated in tail fragments during the regeneration time-course. there was also no significant enrichment of the f-head transcripts that were up-regulated in tail regeneration at  <dig> hours in either p-down or p-up. this suggests that smed-prep is not involved in early brain development, in agreement with previous work that has investigated early brain regeneration  <cit> .

we looked at the expression profiles of p during regeneration and found that  <dig> p-down transcripts are in t36-48-up and  <dig> p-up transcripts are in t36-48-down  with significant enrichment . while p-up overlapped significantly with o-down, p-down overlapped with transcripts up-regulated in t36- <dig> exclusively  . the p-up data is showing that smed-prep is possibly playing a direct or indirect repressive role which facilitates o-down. since the phenotype of smed-prep is loss of the anterior structures, we can reasonably assume that some of p-down is involved in anterior development. the observation that p-down seem to only relate to t36-48-up exclusively suggest t36- <dig> is when smed-prep is up-regulating these anterior developmental transcripts; whereas it was not necessary to do so in head fragments since anterior structures already exists.figure  <dig>

the expression profile of p-up and p-down during regeneration allowed us to observe the differential role of smed-prep in both head and tail fragments. in head fragments, smed-prep plays a repressive role during the early major regulatory transition in heads. in tail fragments, in addition to also playing the same repressive role during the later major regulatory transition, it activates the anterior structure regeneration program.

triclad specific transcripts are enriched in differentially expressed transcripts during regeneration
we annotated the consolidated transcriptome by blasting against  <dig> proteomes: caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, danio rerio, homo sapiens, mus musculus, schistosoma mansoni, clonorchis sinensis, strongylocentrotus purpuratus, nematostella vectensis lottia gigantea, helobdella robusta, capitella teleta and  <dig> transcriptomes: girardia trigrina, procotyla fluviatilis <cit> , denrocoelum lacteum <cit> . at an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> or less,  <dig>  transcripts had at least one hit and  <dig>  transcripts at e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> or less.

we categorized the transcripts based on species hits to generate lists of transcripts that were potentially s. mediterranea specific, triclad specific, and platyhelminth specific . we performed this analysis on increasing e-value strictness and found  <dig>  potentially s. mediterranea specific transcripts,  <dig>  triclad specific transcripts, and  <dig>  platyhelminthes specific transcripts at the highest strictness level .figure  <dig>

in addition to blast annotations, we also performed protein domain predictions on the transcriptome using models from the pfam database  <cit>  resulting in  <dig>  transcripts with domain annotations. using this domain information, we were able to look at the composition of domains within the strict platyhelminth and triclad specific lists of transcripts.

within the platyhelminthes specific transcripts,  <dig> transcripts had pfam annotations. the low number of domain annotations probably reflects the heavy bias of known protein domains towards nematode, insect and vertebrate systems. we found that the most abundantly represented domain in platyhelminth specific list was the  <dig> transmembrane receptor domain  of the rhodopsin family  found in  <dig> transcripts. this agrees with a previous study which catalogued the repertoire of g protein-coupled receptors  in s. mediterranea and found a large expansion of platyhelminth specific gpcr of the rhodopsin subfamily  <cit> .

within the triclad specific transcripts,  <dig> transcripts had pfam annotations with the ubiquitin domain  being most represented in  <dig> transcripts. the ubiquitin protease system  is the main cellular proteolytic mechanism that uses ubiquitin to tag and target proteins for degradation. several studies have implicated ups in drosophila development  <cit>  and regeneration in various systems  making ups a potential target for further research.

we also looked at the expression profile of triclad specific transcripts during regeneration and found there was significant enrichment in differentially expressed transcripts  during both head and tail regeneration .figure  <dig>

together our data identify a large set of potentially novel and/or rapidly evolving genes that are clearly differentially expressed during regeneration. previous studies in planarians and other regenerative models have highlighted a role of conserved genes, known from studies of development, as key regulators of regeneration. more recent genome wide studies using transcriptomics have revealed that lineage specific genes may also be important and require study  <cit> . our data also support that this may be the case during planarian regeneration. in particular we uncover an enrichment of novel genes during a regulatory transition that is shared between different regenerative scenarios. our data suggest that the potent regenerative capacity in planarians may be partly due to novel mechanisms conserved within the highly regenerative triclad clade and pave the way for functional study of these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have generated a consolidated transcriptome from  <dig> independently assembled transcriptomes and available ests. this consolidated dataset represents a high confidence set of transcripts providing a valuable resource for future expression studies. our regeneration transcriptome consisting of regenerating head and tail fragments from  <dig> to  <dig> days reveals a shared regulatory program consisting of over  <dig>  transcripts active at temporally shifted time-periods between regenerating head  and in tail fragments . additional rna-seq experiments on smed-prep animals versus control tail fragments allowed us to find transcripts that are regulated differentially in response to smed-prep. we observed that these smed-prep response transcripts are enriched during the shared regulatory program during regeneration suggesting an involvement in brain regeneration. we also performed blast alignment to  <dig> species across eukaryotes to identify novel or divergent genes and found lists of s. mediterranea, triclad, and platyhelminth specific transcripts. triclad specific transcripts are found to be enriched in differentially expressed transcripts throughout regeneration suggesting novel mechanisms may contribute to the animal’s potent regenerative capacity.
