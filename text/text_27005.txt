BACKGROUND
exocytosis, the fusion of intracellular secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, is essential for protein targeting and for secretion of soluble vesicle components to the extracellular milieu. this pathway occurs constitutively in all cell types but can also be a highly regulated process, such as synaptic vesicle exocytosis in neurons. the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is driven by interactions between the plasma membrane snare proteins syntaxin  <dig> and snap <dig> and the vesicle snare vamp <dig>  <cit> . these neuronal snare proteins are specific targets of the potent botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins, emphasizing their essential functions in synaptic vesicle fusion events  <cit> . in contrast to syntaxin  <dig> and synaptobrevin, which are transmembrane proteins, snap <dig> is synthesized as a soluble protein and is anchored to membranes via the palmitoylation of a central cysteine-rich cluster  <cit> .

snap <dig> is expressed as alternatively spliced isoforms, snap25a and snap25b  <cit> . these splice variants differ by only  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acids, a result of differential usage of two alternative exon  <dig> sequences . interestingly, three of the non-conserved residues occur within the cysteine-rich domain, altering the configuration of the palmitoylated cysteines. these differences in the cysteine-rich domains of snap25a and snap25b may affect their interaction with palmitoyl transferases  <cit> , and the precise intracellular targeting of the proteins  <cit> .

whereas snap25a/b expression is restricted to neuronal cells and a small number of cells outside the central nervous system , snap <dig> is expressed ubiquitously  <cit> . snap <dig> is ~ 60% identical to snap <dig>  and has been proposed to function in both regulated exocytosis and constitutive membrane fusion events  <cit> .

elegant electrophysiological studies using adrenal medullary chromaffin cells from snap <dig> null mouse embryos revealed that over-expression of either snap25a or snap25b rescues exocytosis  <cit> . interestingly though, snap25b supports more exocytosis than snap25a in this system, clearly showing that the isoforms do not have directly interchangeable functions  <cit> . indeed, transgenic mice in which exon 5b is replaced with an extra copy of exon 5a  exhibit developmental defects, seizures and impairment of learning  <cit> .

despite the importance of the snap <dig> splice variants, there have been no comparative analyses of endogenous snap25a and snap25b protein expression; this is entirely due to a lack of suitable antibodies to distinguish between the splice variants. as a result, all characterization of endogenously expressed snap25a/b has been performed at the mrna level. interestingly, in mice, snap25a and snap25b transcript levels are broadly similar until around two weeks after birth, following which there is a dramatic up-regulation of snap25b levels  <cit> . in contrast, levels of snap25a mrna exhibit at best a marginal increase during post-natal development in the same samples  <cit> . a similar post-natal increase in snap25b expression was reported for rat brain  <cit> . the mrna encoding snap25a and snap25b also exhibit differences in regional expression, for example, at p <dig> snap25a was enriched in layer iv of the cortex, whereas snap25b was more abundant in the outer and inner cortical layers  <cit> . whereas snap25b mrna is the most abundant isoform expressed in many post-natal brain regions, snap25a mrna is the major isoform in adrenal and pituitary glands and in neuroendocrine pc <dig> cells  <cit> .

analysis of the mrna expression profiles of snap25a and snap25b has provided important information on the relative expression of these snap <dig> splice variants. however there is not always a direct correlation between mrna levels and protein expression  <cit> . here we describe the generation and characterization of antibodies that can distinguish between snap25a and snap25b, and their use to investigate developmental and regional patterns of expression of the splice variants in rat and human brain.

RESULTS
generation and characterization of antibodies that selectively recognize either snap25a or snap25b
to study the expression profile of snap25a and snap25b proteins, rabbits were immunized with peptides that correspond to non-conserved regions of the isoforms present within the differentially spliced exon  <dig> . these different peptides did not contain more than four identical contiguous amino acids and only  <dig> out of  <dig> residues were identical . igg fractions were purified from the collected antisera: igg # <dig> was from rabbits immunized with the snap25a peptide and igg # <dig> was from rabbits immunized with the snap25b peptide.

to test the specificity of the antibodies, lysates were prepared from hek293t cells that had been transfected with egfp-snap25a, egfp-snap25b or egfp-snap <dig>  igg  <dig> specifically recognized snap25a, and igg  <dig> detected snap25b but not snap25a . figure 1a shows that the sequence of snap <dig> in the region used for peptide synthesis is very similar to snap25b; consistent with this, the  <dig> antibody also displayed immunoreactivity against snap <dig> .

to examine whether the  <dig> and  <dig> antibodies could distinguish between endogenously expressed snap25a and snap25b, lysates were prepared from cerebellum samples from wild-type mice and from mice in which exon 5b is replaced with an additional copy of exon 5a   <cit> . as a result of this replacement, these transgenic mice exclusively express snap25a. the  <dig> and  <dig> antibodies exhibited very high selectivity towards endogenous snap25a and snap25b, respectively . total snap <dig> and snap <dig> levels were not noticeably different between the samples , and the massive increase in snap25a levels in the snap25a/a cerebellum reflects the much higher expression of the snap25b isoform in this brain region of wild-type animals . the very faint residual band detected by the  <dig> antibody in the cerebellum of snap25a/a mice is presumably snap <dig>  highlighting the vast excess of snap25b protein compared with snap <dig> in brain samples. this observation is important as it shows that cross-reactivity with snap <dig> has a negligible contribution to overall signal intensity of the  <dig> antibody in brain. collectively, the results displayed in figure  <dig> demonstrate the specificity of the  <dig> and  <dig> antibodies towards snap25a and snap25b respectively, and show that these antibodies reliably report on the relative expression levels of the endogenously expressed protein isoforms.

developmental expression of snap25a and snap25b in rat brain
snap <dig> displays a marked increase in expression from around post-natal week two in mice, and analysis of mrna levels demonstrated a specific increase in the snap25b transcript at this stage  <cit> . however, expression of snap25a/b proteins will be affected by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional  effects. therefore, we examined how snap25a/b protein levels change during post-natal development. brain lysates prepared from sprague dawley rats at different ages were probed with the  <dig> and  <dig> antibodies. snap25b exhibited a dramatic up-regulation in expression beginning at around post-natal week two ; similar increases in snap25b expression were observed in every set of samples that we tested. snap25a also exhibited a developmental increase but this was more modest and variable than snap25b . expression levels of snap <dig> were relatively constant throughout development . for quantification purposes, we compared mean values of the fold increase in brain expression levels of the snap25/ <dig> isoforms between a late embryonic stage  and ~  <dig> month after birth . the graph in figure 2a highlights the robust increase in snap25b levels during this period compared with snap25a and snap <dig>  no gender-specific differences in snap25a/b expression levels were apparent at e <dig> .

we next examined if the developmental increase in snap25b levels was similar in different brain regions. the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex were collected from rats at p <dig> and p <dig>  and lysed. figure 2c reveals that snap25b expression increased between p <dig> and p <dig> to a similar extent in each brain region tested.

regional expression of snap25a and snap25b in rat brain
to compare the regional expression levels of snap25a and snap25b in brain, samples of hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum and cortex from ~ <dig> week-old rats were analyzed by immunoblotting. snap25a displayed highest levels  in cortex and hypothalamus , whereas snap25b had the highest immunoreactivity in cortex and cerebellum lysates. a marked difference in regional expression levels between the snap <dig> isoforms was detected in cerebellum: snap25b expression was highest in this brain region, whereas snap25a expression was lowest . probing the brain region lysates with a pansnap <dig> antibody revealed that total snap <dig> expression levels mirrored those of snap25b , consistent with the idea that snap25b is the major snap <dig> isoform expressed in adult brain.

regional expression and semi-quantitative comparison of snap25a, snap25b, and snap <dig> in human brain
having characterized regional expression patterns of snap25a and snap25b in rat brain, we next examined expression in post-mortem samples of human brain. for this, lysates of cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and thalamus were prepared from  <dig> post-mortem brains. equal amounts of the individual lysates from each brain region were then pooled and resolved on sds-page gels alongside a dilution series of hek293t lysates from cells transfected with egfp-snap25a, egfp-snap25b or egfp-snap <dig> . densitometry was then used to estimate the relative expression levels of snap25a, snap25b and snap <dig> in the different brain regions by comparison with the egfp-tagged standards . this semi-quantitative analysis revealed that expression of snap25b was highest and snap <dig> expression lowest in every brain region examined. the expression pattern of snap25a in human brain was grossly similar to that observed in rat brain, with this isoform highest in cortex and only weakly expressed in cerebellum.

discussion
the generation of antibodies that distinguish between snap <dig> splice variants is an important development that will significantly advance the study of these protein isoforms. rna analysis provides a measure of relative protein expression levels but this can be complicated by differential protein turnover and stability. antibodies also offer scope to study the intracellular localization of the endogenously expressed proteins, and to determine if the distinct cysteine-rich domains of snap25a/b mediate different intracellular sorting patterns; these analyses are ongoing in our laboratory. cross-reactivity of the snap25b antibody  with snap <dig> was unavoidable. however, figure 1c and figure  <dig> demonstrate that snap25b is expressed at much higher levels than snap <dig> in brain, and that the contribution of snap <dig> to signal intensity with the  <dig> antibody is negligible. however, cross-reactivity is likely to be more of an issue when using the  <dig> antibody on samples other than brain, or in brain areas where snap25b is weakly expressed.

previous work had shown that snap25b mrna is selectively up-regulated during post-natal development  <cit> . our study is in broad agreement with these findings. however in some experiments we did also detect a marked increase in snap25a expression; we currently do not know the reason for this variability. nevertheless, these observations suggest that mrna analyses may not provide a complete picture of snap25a/b expression levels and indicates that the stability of snap25a protein may change during post-natal development. the increased post-natal expression of snap25b was similar in hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex, implying that changes in expression of this isoform are largely occurring at a global level.

snap25a and snap25b displayed differential patterns of expression in gross brain regions. in rat brain, a marked difference was found in cerebellum, where snap25b was highly expressed and snap25a was only present at low levels. the weak expression of snap25a in cerebellum was also observed in post-mortem samples from human brain. it is possible that snap25b is the more evolutionarily-ancient of the two snap <dig> isoforms given that snap25b shares higher sequence identity with snap <dig> . these new antibodies offer scope to extend upon these observations, for example, by analyzing how the isoforms are distributed in more defined sub-regions of the brain or in specific neuronal populations.

the increased level of exocytosis supported by snap25b in mouse embryonic chromaffin cells was shown to be attributable to splicing differences that occur upstream of the palmitoylated cysteines  <cit> . these results might suggest that differential palmitoylation of snap25a and snap25b does not impact on the functionality of the isoforms. however functional outcomes attributable to differences within the palmitoylated cysteine-rich domains of snap25a/b will probably arise via changes in membrane interaction and/or lateral organization in the membrane  <cit> . these parameters are likely to be saturated by the high level over-expression  achieved in these studies. thus, there is some merit in studying the expression and localization of snap25a/b at high resolution. in particular, the use of specific antibodies against these proteins will be important to analyse patterning of the endogenous proteins and thus without any confounding effects of over-expression or fluorescent tags. similarly, it will be interesting in the future to assess whether functional effects related to the different cysteine-rich domains of these snap <dig> isoforms are apparent when the proteins are expressed at endogenous levels.

at a similar time when this work was submitted for publication, a paper was published by the takahashi group also describing the production of isoform-specific antibodies against the snap <dig> family and their use to analyse expression of the proteins in mouse brain  <cit> . similar to our study, this study reported relatively low expression levels of snap25a in cerebellum, and that snap25b is the major isoform expressed in brain .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that snap25a and snap25b proteins display distinct regional and developmental profiles in rat and human brain. this analysis will be helpful in further delineating how the function of these isoforms overlaps and/or is distinct. the antibodies generated in the study will serve as useful tools for future work in this area.
