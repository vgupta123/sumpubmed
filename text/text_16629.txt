BACKGROUND
drought is a major environmental stress that can have severe impacts on plant productivity and survival. upon drought, plants will perform an array of complex responses, involving molecular, biochemical, physiological and morphological changes  <cit> . as a result of adaptation to environmental conditions, for example water availability and drought, various drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms have evolved. these mechanisms include whole-plant changes such as shoot-root allocation, growth rate, leaf morphology, leaf abscission, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, as well as molecular changes underpinned by remodelling of the transcriptome that may include upregulation of stress signalling, transcription factors and defence processes  <cit> . due to the availability of the populus trichocarpa genome sequence  <cit> , transcriptional responses to abiotic stresses in woody plants have primarily been studied in various poplar species. comparisons of gene expression levels between samples from different tissues, time points and treatments has been performed using microarrays  or more recently massively parallel sequencing of total rna, i.e. rna-seq . as a result, a wealth of information on genes and processes involved in the molecular mechanisms of drought responses in different poplar species is available. these studies have revealed large variation in transcriptional drought responses between different species. for example, in the leaves of p. trichocarpa,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between drought and control conditions  <cit> , while in the leaves of p. balsamifera only  <dig> probe sets displayed increased transcript abundance under drought  <cit> . other studies have revealed variation in drought responses between populations  and even between genotypes of the same species  <cit> . these observed differences could originate from genetic diversification as a result of adaption to different drought conditions  <cit> . such diversifying selection should be visible as genetic variation in important genes involved in drought response. thus, identifying genetic variation associated with variation in phenotypic responses, could provide valuable insight into the genetic basis of drought adaptation. the ultimate goal would be to pinpoint genetic variants that are associated with phenotypic responses to drought that could then be used in marker assisted selection to produce cultivars better adapted to drought conditions. in order to do so, there is an urgent need for information on phenotypic and transcriptional responses from species other than model-species. in this work we have examined and compared drought responses in willow genotypes  that, like poplars, are woody perennials in the salicaceae family. species from both genera have for a long time been grown as bioenergy crops worldwide and there are active breeding programs for developing new high performing varieties  <cit> . willows are particularly suitable for cultivations in regions with good water supply such as most of northern europe  <cit> . however, considering that willows appear to be prone to drought stress  <cit> , drought tolerant varieties are desired for cultivations in southern europe  <cit> . for the purpose of bioenergy, salix viminalis, s. dascyclados and s. schwerinii and their hybrids are the mostly used species in europe as they display rapid growth and high biomass yields  <cit> . there is relatively high genetic diversity in natural populations of willows  <cit> , which have proven useful for the identification of quantitative trait loci  of different traits such as frost and rust resistance and phenology , growth, water-use efficiency and drought tolerance  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to investigate phenotypic and transcriptional drought responses in two willow genotypes originating from an experimental cross between s. viminalis ×   <cit> . in order to achieve this, we performed a controlled experiment in a phytotrone where a number of phenotypic measurements were assessed. since different organs show very different responses to drought  we estimated the effects of drought separately in mature leaves and root tips. we performed massive parallel sequencing of rna  on the illumina platform, assembled the sequencing reads de novo into gene models and then mapped the reads back to the gene models in order to quantify the level of gene expression per gene model among the different samples. we then performed go enrichment analyses on the set of differentially expressed genes to identify important functional categories involved in the response to drought in the two tissues and genotypes.

RESULTS
phenotypic responses to drought
plants grown in ww conditions were both taller )  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm), had more sylleptic shoots and greater total root, shoot and leaf biomasses compared to the drought stressed plants . these differences were established already shortly after the onset of the experimental treatments, and the same overall pattern remained across the whole experimental period . leaf chlorophyll concentration, here assessed in terms of spad i.e. leaf nitrogen  per leaf area  <cit> , was significantly higher in the drought treatment compared to the ww condition , and also that pattern was similar across the entire experimental period . in contrast to the leaf chlorophyll  concentration, the total accumulation of n was reduced by drought. thus, at the end of the experiment, total number of leaves and total n accumulation in leaves, which is a main driver for growth, were greatly reduced by drought . the drought-exposed plants also had greater relative biomass allocation to roots compared to the ww plants . in contrast to roots, relative shoot and leaf allocation  was not significantly affected by drought stress .fig.  <dig> means  for various eco-physiological traits in genotype  <dig> and and  <dig>  the genotypes were grown in a growth chamber  and exposed to two experimental conditions  and drought ). dw = dry weight , rgr = relative growth rate, lar = leaf area ratio, lap = leaf area productivity, sla = specific leaf area, rwc = relative water content, spad values indicate leaf chlorophyll content

fig.  <dig> means for shoot height  and spad value  in genotype  <dig> and  <dig> assessed non-destructively during the experimental treatment period in april. the genotypes were grown in a growth chamber  and exposed to two experimental conditions, i.e. well-watered  and drought . mean standard deviation  across all treatments and genotypes is indicated in the lower left corner



many traits differed between the two genotypes . at the end of the experiment, mean height growth was significantly higher for genotype  <dig> compared to  <dig>  both in the ww and in the drought conditions  =  <dig> , not shown). genotype  <dig> also produced many more sylleptic shoots than genotype  <dig>  but had fewer leaves and lower total leaf n pool . mean total biomass at the start of the experimental treatments was similar in the two treatments . the biomass allocation to roots  was similar between the genotypes, whilst leaf and shoot allocation varied significantly between the genotypes . there were also several significant interaction effects between genotype and treatment, indicating differential drought responses for the two genotypes. for example, genotype  <dig> displayed greater drought-induced increase in root biomass allocation  than 520; leaf biomass allocation decreased  and increased  in response to drought; and shoot biomass allocation increased in response to drought only in genotype  <dig>  effects). in contrast, genotype  <dig> was characterised by stronger drought-induced reduction of leaf number and total leaf n pool, whilst  <dig> showed stronger drought-induced reduction in the number of sylleptic shoots .

relative growth rate  was greatly reduced by drought condition , but similar between the genotypes . the drought-induced reduction in rgr was accomplished by corresponding reductions in leaf area ratio , specific leaf area  and biomass productivity per unit leaf area   . as indicated by significant genotype by treatment interactions, the reduction of rgr, total plant dw and total leaf n pool by drought was more pronounced in  <dig> than  <dig> . that genotype  was characterized by generally higher leaf area ratio  and lower leaf area productivity  compared to  <dig> . following eqn.  <dig>  the greater lar of  <dig> was mostly a consequence of greater leaf biomass allocation . in contrast, the higher lap of  <dig> was a consequence of greater leaf chlorophyll content  in that genotype. ultimately, the rgr of the high-spad genotype , was less affected by drought compared to the high-lar genotype .

leaf temperature and relative water content  varied between growth conditions, but were similar between genotypes . in drought condition, rwc decreased, leaf temperature increased, stomata were more closed , intrinsic water use efficiency was higher , and also carboxylation efficiency was higher  . genotype affected isotope ratios, and the genotype  <dig> had lower intrinsic water use efficiency  and lower carboxylation efficiency  than genotype  <dig> . in general, leaf gas exchange as reflected by the isotope data indicates small genotype differences under ww conditions along with great genotype differences in drought conditions. this pattern was statistically supported by highly significant interaction effects in all isotope measures . more specifically, the drought-induced decrease in stomatal conductance  was less pronounced in  <dig> compared to  <dig>  also drought-induced increase in intrinsic water use efficiency  was less pronounced in  <dig> than in  <dig> .

de novo assembly and identification of degs
illumina sequencing of  <dig> libraries prepared from rna extracted from leaf and root tip tissues from two willow genotypes generated  <dig>  ×  <dig> paired-end sequencing read pairs that corresponds to  <dig> ×  <dig> base pairs  . sequencing read pair numbers per library varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million and did not differ significantly between tissues , genotypes  or treatment . when all sequencing reads were combined and assembled de novo using the trinity assembler,  <dig>  contigs were obtained, which represented  <dig>  gene models. after filtering on gene expression ≥ 1),  <dig>  gene models remained of which  <dig>  contained open reading frames . the gene models in this high confidence gene set ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp with a mean length of 1485 bp and a median length of 1273 bp .  <dig>  % of all reads mapped to the high confidence gene set with the parameters used for expression analysis. the majority of them  mapped to one unique position. more detailed mapping statistics can be found in table  <dig>  the program edger was used with the “calcnormfactors()” function to identify degs between drought and ww conditions in: 1) leaves of genotype  <dig> , 2) leaves of genotype  <dig> , 3) root tips of genotype  <dig>  and 4) root tips of genotype  <dig> . normalized read counts are listed in additional file  <dig> and normalization factors used in the edger analyses are listed in additional file  <dig>  genes were defined as upregulated degs if false discovery rate  was ≤  <dig>  and log <dig> fold change  ≥  <dig> and as downregulated degs if fdr was ≤  <dig>  and log <dig> fc ≤ − <dig>  a total of  <dig> degs were identified across genotypes and tissues, representing  <dig> unique gene models.  <dig> degs were upregulated  and  <dig> were downregulated  . much fewer degs were found in the leaves than in the root tips , a pattern that was consistent across both genotypes. this result manifests the small effects of drought on the overall transcription in the young mature leaves in these two genotypes and shows that root tips instead have a much stronger transcriptional response to drought than leaves do. when comparing the two genotypes, more degs were found in the leaves of genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig>  while the number of degs in the root tips was more similar between the genotypes  . twenty-eight genes  displayed significant g x t effects when using a generalized linear model and the gene ontology  term adp-binding was significantly enriched among these genes. when comparing the drought responses in the leaves and the root tips of the two genotypes for these genes,  <dig> displayed greater drought responses in leaves than in the root tips. the hypothesis that there was an equal chance that the effect is stronger in either tissue could thus be rejected . this result further strengthens the finding of greater genotypic differences in the drought responses in the leaves than in the roots.table  <dig> summary of illumina sequencing and mapping of the sequencing read to the genes in the high confidence gene set

functional annotation and go enrichment analysis
the blast2go software tool was used to functionally annotate the de novo assembled gene products and for go enrichment analyses in order to identify functions and genes involved in drought stress responses in the leaves and root tips. of the  <dig>  genes in the high confidence gene set,  <dig>  were annotated with a go term.

the go enrichment analysis was done for up and downregulated annotated degs in leaves and root tips for each genotype separately using the annotated high confidence gene set as reference. all enriched go terms in every comparison are presented in additional file  <dig>  overall, few go terms were enriched for the degs in the leaves, in fact none was significantly enriched for the degs in genotype  <dig>  suggesting that drought had little impact on the function of the leaves in this genotype. however, genotype  <dig> showed a greater functional drought response as several go terms were significantly enriched, particularly for the upregulated degs. for example at the molecular function  ontology level, “peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity” was one of the most significantly overrepresented terms and at the biological process  ontology level, different response and regulation terms were significantly overrepresented . at the cellular component  ontology level, several terms related to the thylakoid and the cell wall were overrepresented . for the downregulated degs at the f ontology level, “oxygen binding” was the most significantly overrepresented term . at the p ontology level, “arachidonic acid metabolic process” and “epoxygenase p <dig> pathway” were overrepresented. no term was significantly overrepresented at the c ontology level.

many more go terms were enriched for the degs in the root tips compared to the leaves, which demonstrates the greater drought responses in this tissue compared to the leaves. in fig.  <dig> we present overrepresented go terms  in the p ontology level associated with upregulated  and downregulated  degs for both genotypes. many go terms were significantly or nearly significantly enriched in both genotypes, which means that the genotypes displayed overall similar responses to drought in the root tips. for the upregulated degs, the most affected functions were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic processes .fig.  <dig> over-represented go terms at the biological process ontology level for up-  and downregulated  degs in the root tips of genotype  <dig> and genotype  <dig>  the red bars show the number of degs annotated with the go terms in the root tips of genotype  <dig> and the blue bars show the number of degs annotated with the go terms in the root tips of genotype  <dig>  go terms are presented if they were enriched  in at least one of the two genotypes and if at least ten genes were enriched for that term. solid bars represent a significant over-representation of the go term in this genotype while fainted bars are given as reference if the significance level was not reached



a core set of candidate genes involved in the drought response
to identify candidate genes involved in drought stress responses in the two willow genotypes, we extracted the upregulated degs in the root tips of both genotypes annotated with any of the  <dig> “response” go terms listed in table  <dig>  this resulted in a list with  <dig> genes for genotype  <dig> and  <dig> genes for genotype  <dig> . based on annotations and reported functions in stress responses, a core set of  <dig> candidate genes were identified  that could function as targets for detailed functional studies of drought responses at the molecular level in willows and related species. several of the genes were homologous to genes encoding transcription factors, e.g. mybs, wrkys, bzips and heat stress transcription factors with known functions in stress responses. other genes were homologous to genes encoding dehydrin and chlorophyll a/b binding proteins.table  <dig> go terms associated with upregulated degs in the root tips that were enriched  in at least one of the genotypes and used to select candidate genes with putative functions in drought responses in willows

discussion
genotype specific physiological responses to drought
this study accommodated a growth experiment in which cuttings of two genotypes were grown in an irrigation contrast for sufficiently long time to develop considerable variation both at the transcriptional and phenotypic levels. we demonstrated that the two genotypes displayed contrasting phenotypic responses to drought. genotype  <dig> was overall less affected by drought as it displayed a weaker growth reduction. the weaker growth reduction of  <dig> was associated with greater increase in root biomass allocation  in response to drought, enhancing the capacity to explore available water and nutrient resources. interestingly, genotype  <dig> also displayed generally higher foliar spad values, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that higher area-based leaf n content is an acclimation to drought  <cit> . in contrast to  <dig>  genotype  <dig> displayed generally higher evapotranspiration area  and responded to drought with strong leaf area reduction, greatly decreased stomatal conductance and increased intrinsic water use efficiency. thus, in addition to the observed genotypic variation in mean traits , we also found indications for genotype differences in trait variability in a drought contrast, especially for the stomatal physiology traits . genotypic differences in trait variability, observed in a drought contrast, may be indicative of genotypic variation in trait plasticity in relation to drought. large genotypic variation in trait plasticity of leaf traits similar to the ones in our study was found among eucalyptus provenances originating from a rainfall gradient in australia, and interpreted as important features in the climate adaptation of these trees  <cit> .

generation of the high confidence gene set
de novo assembly of all sequencing reads generated  <dig>  gene models and after filtering out lowly expressed gene models,  <dig>  remained. in a next filtering step, gene models that did not contain an open reading frame were filtered out, leaving  <dig>  gene models in the high confidence gene set. out of these,  <dig>  were functionally annotated with a go term in blast2go. although it is problematic to compare these numbers with those from other studies as different tissues and also filtering criteria are often used, de novo assembly of rna-seq data in p. pruinosa resulted in  <dig>  gene models  <cit>  and in s. matsudana  <dig>  unigenes were retrieved  <cit> , showing that the figures were overall rather similar across the different species. the number of annotated genes in this high confidence set was considerably higher than the number of gene models annotated with a go term in p. pruinosa and p. euphratica where  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig> in  <cit>  were reported respectively, possibly reflecting improved annotations tools.

variation in the number of degs and enriched go terms between the two genotypes and tissues
when comparing the responses to drought between the two tissues we found that drought affected gene expression of many more genes in the root tips compared to the leaves, a result that was consistent across both genotypes. a similar pattern was previously observed in hybrid poplars   <cit>  where about twice as many probe sets displayed a significant change in response to drought in the root tips compared to the mature leaves. the authors proposed that this difference could in part be explained by the higher sensitivity to water deprivation in an actively growing tissue, i.e. the root tips. judging from the number of degs in the root tips, the two genotypes displayed rather similar responses. this similarity was also evident in the enriched go terms associated with these degs that were present in both genotypes. a somehow more unexpected result was the numerous enriched terms in the cellular component level that was related to the chloroplast. the overall lack of response of drought on gene expression in the mature leaves was also unexpected as several previous studies have reported a greater response in leaves. for instance, in p. trichocarpa  <dig> degs were identified in leaves  <cit> , in p. euphratica, where  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in leaves  <cit>  and in hybrid poplar   <dig> were affected in leaves  <cit> . results from the present study instead resemble the results in p. balsamifera where  <dig> probe sets displayed increased transcript abundance to drought  <cit> . less responses were also seen in shoots of p. balsamifera  <cit> . in contrast to the root tips, the genotypes displayed a greater difference in the responses in the leaves with much fewer degs and enriched go terms in genotype  <dig> than in genotype  <dig>  strong genotypic effects were previously found in leaves of hybrid poplars  <cit>  and p. balsamifera   <cit> . this was also seen in shoots of hybrid poplar clones   <cit> . interestingly, genotype  <dig> also displayed less physiological responses at the leaf level compared to genotype  <dig> supporting a correlation between transcriptional and physiological responses. for example, the drought-induced shifts in stomatal physiology  were more pronounced in the genotype  <dig>  which coincides with the overrepresented go terms “thylakoid” and cell wall in the cellular component ontology level. among the  <dig> genes that displayed significant g x t effects, several encoded disease resistant proteins and leucine-rich repeat proteins. an exciting hypothesis is that the two genotypes carry different alleles at these genes rendering different drought responses.

a core set of candidate genes involved in drought stress responses
we have produced a core set of candidate genes that we find particularly interesting and that should be further examined for their role in the molecular stress responses and we discuss some of them here. among our candidate genes were several transcription factors i.e. mybs, bzips and wrkys, with known functions in aba-dependent stress responses  <cit> . they among other things regulate stress responses via modulation of transcription of downstream genes. furthermore, several candidate genes encoded chlorophyll a/b binding proteins . typical for this protein family is the cab domain, containing the amino acid residues involved in pigment binding. there are some indications that they function in high-light protection in a broad sense and that they encode homologs to light-harvesting-like proteins . all organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis also contain lils  <cit> , which are highly homologous to the higher plant light-harvesting antenna and contain the cab domain. the lils are regulated opposite to the light-harvesting complex proteins ; under high light condition - when the expression of lhcs is repressed - the lils are upregulated. while in cyanobacteria lils have been found to respond to different stresses, their function in plant was thought to be restricted to light stress  <cit> . it is thus possible that these genes and gene products play an important role in the stress response – even in non-photosynthetic tissue. also in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit>  enhanced expression of such genes was observed in roots exposed to drought stress, indicating a general importance of these genes independent of the species.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report the first large transcriptome study in willows where we have compared physiological and transcriptional responses to drought between two genotypes and two tissues. a de novo assembly and subsequent filtering of root tip and leaf transcriptomes across the two genotypes and two conditions, generated a set with  <dig>  genes. a total of  <dig> unique degs were identified between the drought and ww conditions, of which the majority were found in the root tips. we also found substantial differences in drought responses between the genotypes, both at the phenotypic and trancriptional level. phenotypically, genotype  <dig> displayed less growth reduction in response to drought compared to genotype  <dig>  which suggests that this genotype is more drought adapted than genotype  <dig>  in addition to the genotypic variation in several mean traits, we also found considerable genotypic variation in trait plasticity , which may play a role in drought adaptation. at the transcriptional level, genotype  <dig> displayed a greater response in the leaves as many more degs were found compared to genotype  <dig>  as the two genotypes displayed overall similar transcriptional responses in the root tips, but more variation in the leaves, it is possible that the observed phenotypic differences between the genotypes are due to transcriptional differences in their leaves. we also identified a core set of candidate genes encoding proteins with a putative function in drought response, for example mybs, bzips and wrkys and chlorophyll a/b binding proteins. knowledge from this study increases our understanding of the physiological and molecular basis of drought responses in willows, however these results are applicable to all woody plants.
