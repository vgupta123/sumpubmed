BACKGROUND
the antibiotic consumption in the agricultural industry has increasing concern in relation to development of antimicrobial resistance in both animals and humans  <cit> . in denmark approximately 50% of the antibiotics in pigs is used for treatment of diarrhoea  <cit> . optimizing antibiotic treatments or reducing disease occurrence necessitates a correct diagnosis. a number of intestinal pathogens have been associated with diarrhoea in growing pigs, including escherichia coli, brachyspira pilosicoli, brachyspira hyodysenteriae, salmonella spp. and lawsonia intracellularis. l. intracellularis is the cause of proliferative enteropathy  and considered one of the most important intestinal pathogens  <cit> . clinical signs associated with the different intestinal pathogens are similar and microbiological investigations are necessary to confirm the specific microbiological cause in cases of diarrhoea. for l. intracellularis obtaining a correct microbiological diagnosis is complicated. subclinical infection is common  <cit> , l. intracellularis can be demonstrated by pcr in animals vaccinated by an avirulent live vaccine  <cit>  and the bacterial load in faeces could previously not be assessed in routine diagnostic work as the bacterium could only be cultivated and maintained in cell cultures  <cit> . development of quantitative pcr  tests for quantification of l. intracellularis in faeces  <cit>  has now made it possible to determine the number of l. intracellularis bacteria in faeces on a routine basis. this may be useful for confirmation of l. intracellularis as the microbiological cause in porcine diarrhoea. correlation between disease severity and excretion load for a specific pathogen may be expected. however, such correlation cannot always be demonstrated  <cit> .

in this paper a quantitative real time pcr was used to investigate correlation between histological findings of l. intracellularis in porcine cases of diarrhoea and the quantity of l. intracellularis detected by qpcr in faeces

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> outbreaks were examined  and  <dig> pigs  were euthanized during the herd visits. four pigs were excluded as less than  <dig>  gram of faeces had been obtained, providing a total of  <dig> pigs with diarrhoea for the statistical analysis.

l. intracellularis was detected by qpcr in  <dig> % of the pigs. among the qpcr positive pigs  <dig> % were below the dynamic range  of the qpcr,  <dig> % were in the dynamic range and no pigs were above the dynamic range . the median excretion for all positive pigs was  <dig>  log <dig> bacteria/g faeces.

gross pathology
gross lesions of pe were demonstrated in  <dig> % of the pigs. the mean gross lesions in pigs with measureable lesions  were  <dig> cm in extent . among the pigs without gross lesions,  <dig> % were qpcr positives . among the pigs with gross lesions,  <dig> % were qpcr positives . spearman’s correlation coefficient between the measureable pe lesions and l. intracellularis excretion was  <dig>  . association between the measureable pe lesions and l. intracellularis excretion in qpcr positive pigs are displayed in figure  <dig>  the median l. intracellularis excretion was significantly higher in pigs with gross lesions  compared to pigs without gross lesions  .

histopathology
histological lesions of pe were demonstrated in  <dig> % of the pigs. among the pigs without histological lesions,  <dig> % were qpcr positives . among the pigs with histological lesions,  <dig> % were qpcr positives . the test for trend demonstrated a significantly increasing trend in excretion level for increasing histopathology scores . spearman’s correlation coefficient between the histopathology scores and l. intracellularis excretion was  <dig>  . association between the histopathology score and l. intracellularis excretion is displayed in figure  <dig> 

immunohistochemistry
l. intracellularis was detected by ihc in  <dig> % of the pigs. among the ihc negative pigs,  <dig> % were qpcr positives . among the ihc positive pigs,  <dig> % were qpcr positives . the kruskal-wallis equality of populations rank tests demonstrated an overall significantly difference between the median excretion levels for the ihc scores . the test for trend demonstrated a significantly increasing trend in excretion level for increasing ihc scores . spearman’s correlation coefficient between the ihc scores and l. intracellularis excretion was  <dig>  . association between the ihc score and l. intracellularis excretion is displayed in figure  <dig> 

discussion
routine q-pcr quantification of a number of virus infections is now well established in medicine and has recently been reviewed  <cit> . application of qpcr for quantification of bacterial infections is less well established in routine diagnostics, especially in veterinary medicine. however, correlation between disease severity and qpcr quantification of bacterial infections in clinical samples from animals and humans has been reported for borrelia burgdorferi <cit> , mycoplasma genitalium <cit> , brucella spp.  <cit> , helicobacter pylori <cit> , mycobacterium leprae <cit> , mycoplasma gallisepticum <cit> , streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , brucella melitensis <cit> , haemophilus influenzae <cit>  and legionella penumophila <cit> . further, clinical cut-off levels for bacterial load has been established for streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> , haemophilus influenzae <cit> , mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> , gardnella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae <cit> .

in the current study a positive correlation between disease severity in terms of pathological findings and quantitative detection of l. intracellularis in faeces was demonstrated in pigs with diarrhoea. these results are in accordance with a previous report of correlation between l. intracellularis bacteria load in mucosal scrapings and the severity of intestinal lesions  <cit> . in qpcr positive pigs the median l. intracellularis excretion level was higher in pigs with pe gross lesions compared to pigs without gross lesions. this suggests that quantification by qpcr might be applied for examination of presence or absence of gross lesions of pe. the extent of pe gross lesions and l. intracellularis excretion levels were apparently not correlated. however, this association should be further investigated because of the low number of pigs with gross lesions in the current study.

in contrast, increasing histopathology/ihc scores were correlated to increasing l. intracellularis excretion levels. one interesting aspect of the observed observations is that demonstration of l. intracellularis in faeces is not evident of ileitis but in case of ileitis high excretion levels of l. intracellularis can be expected. the applied study design did not take progression of l. intracellularis infection into consideration. the obtained results are only relevant for the association between gross pathology, histopathology, ihc and quantification of l. intracellularis by qpcr at the time of faecal sampling. correlation over time and progression of l. intracellularis excretion during an infection should be performed in a longitudinal study design. factors that potential could have influenced the results are the intermitted shedding of l. intracellularis previously described  <cit>  and non-homogeneous distribution of l. intracellularis in faeces and/or intestinal tissue. quantification of l. intracellularis in faeces has been reported to have an acceptable within day repeatability  <cit>  suggesting that non-homogeneous distribution of l. intracellularis in faeces is not a major bias in the current study. some of the qpcr negative animals were probably false negatives because of intermitted shedding caused by a l. intracellularis excretion level close to the qpcr’s limit of detection as previously described  <cit> . this aspect has potentially introduced misclassification bias in the study. however, it is most likely only low excreting pigs that were classified as false negatives introducing only minor bias in the ranking of animals, the statistical analysis and the results. inclusion of multiple standardized intestinal segments and inclusion of any gross lesions in the histological examinations have probably decreased any effect of a potential non-homogeneous distribution of l. intracellularis in the intestinal tissue.

other factors including intestinal infections could potentially influence the reported associations. the reported lesions  are very specific for l. intracellularis. therefore it seems very unlikely that other factors would have a confounding effect between these lesions and the faecal l. intracellularis excretion. however it is possible that interactions exists providing different absolute quantitative associations between l. intracellularis and the lesions depending on simultaneous infections or other factors. the number of observations in the current dataset did not allow for investigation of this aspect, which should be explored before clinical relevant threshold levels can be used in practice.

CONCLUSIONS
the study has demonstrated that histological and quantitative pcr detection of l. intracellularis is correlated in pigs with diarrhoea. overall the results suggest that clinically important levels for l. intracellularis excretion in faeces may be established. such clinical threshold levels may be used in practice to confirm a diagnosis of l. intracellularis associated diarrhoea, for monitoring of treatment effects or for prognostic purposes.
