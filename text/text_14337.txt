BACKGROUND
the subdivision of embryonic tissues into serial repeat-units, or segments, is a fundamental patterning process in early vertebrate development, and is most prominent in the formation of the mesodermal somites. somites arise as paired epithelial spheres that bud off from the undifferentiated paraxial mesoderm  flanking the notochord, and subsequently give rise to several tissues including the segmented axial skeleton and epaxial musculature of the adult organism  <cit> .

the formation and development of somites involves the superposition of two orthogonal patterning systems acting within the paraxial mesoderm. the first operates along the anterior-posterior  axis and is intrinsic to the paraxial mesoderm, resulting in individuation of the somites and their concomitant polarization into anterior and posterior halves . somite formation is dependent on a molecular 'clock' within the psm that generates periodic expression of genes including the notch, wnt and fibroblast growth factor  signalling pathways  <cit> . these cyclical gene expression patterns are superimposed on a regressing, longitudinal gradient of fgf expression along the a-p axis that results in the co-ordinated maturation of groups of psm cells into each successive somite. somite polarity is determined within the anterior psm by a complex feedback mechanism mediated by notch signalling, the transcription factors tbx <dig> and mesp <dig>  and ripply <dig>  a negative regulator of mesp <dig>  <cit> .

a second patterning system operates after somite formation, within both dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes, and involves the early antagonistic and synergistic action of signalling molecules, such as sonic hedgehog, noggin and wnt, that originate outside of the paraxial mesoderm  <cit> . this separates the somite into two major sub-components, the sclerotome  and the dermamyotome . it also subdivides the sclerotome into further regions that are distinguished in terms of both morphogenesis and gene expression . these include the ventral peri-notochordal sclerotome that forms the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs; the central  sclerotome that generates the vertebral pedicles, transverse processes and most of the neural arches; and the dorsal sclerotome that gives rise to the vertebral spinous processes  <cit> . in keeping with the differing morphogenesis of these regions, their chondrogenesis is controlled by distinct upstream mechanisms  <cit> . for example, central sclerotome differentiation is regulated by uncx <dig> , and uncx <dig> -deficient mice exhibit a complete loss of the central sclerotome-derived vertebral components mechanisms, while ventral sclerotome is independently regulated by pax <dig> and pax <dig>  thus ventral development is unperturbed in uncx <dig>  mutants  <cit> .

the co-ordinated action of these patterning systems creates a set of volume elements in the sclerotome that generate the mature axial skeleton via a process termed resegmentation  <cit> . the alternating arrangement of a- and p-ventral-half-sclerotomes pre-configures serial repetition of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, and generates a weight-bearing yet flexible vertebral column that supports the head and trunk. the a- and p-central half-sclerotomes form the vertebral canal, which houses and protects the spinal cord, and molecular differences between the two halves of the sclerotome are critical for this process. the p-central-half-sclerotomes, which form the walls of the canal , also impart segmental barriers to emigrating neural crest cells and spinal axon growth cones, thereby imposing secondary segmentation on the developing peripheral spinal nerves  <cit> . by contrast, the a-central-half-sclerotomes form a permissive environment in which neural crest cells can differentiate to form the segmental dorsal root ganglia, and through which further neural crest cells, as well as motor and primary sensory axons, can navigate. the a-central-half-sclerotomes ultimately yield the intervertebral foraminae, ensuring that the spinal nerves can enter and exit the spinal cord unimpeded by the walls of the vertebral canal; they also contribute cells to the endoneurium and perineurium of the spinal nerves  <cit> . in sum, somite polarity ensures optimum mechanical protection of the spinal cord while simultaneously permitting movement of the vertebrate trunk and bidirectional nervous transmission between the spinal cord and the periphery. recently, another functional role of a-p somite polarity has been uncovered, as definitive aortic endothelial cells have been shown to originate from the p-half-somite  <cit> .

while the normal development and function of the vertebrate trunk is critically dependent on correct somite polarity, it remains unclear how the molecular differences between a- and p-cells are transcriptionally-regulated. moreover, while a substantial degree of molecular complexity is likely to distinguish a- from p-cells, and several such differences have been documented, the detailed molecular components and their interactions are unknown  <cit> . identifying such differences is a prerequisite for a sophisticated understanding of vertebral column genetics and the genesis of vertebral anomalies, as well as for future stem cell and tissue engineering strategies to repair the injured or diseased vertebral column. as a first step towards defining the full range of the molecular differences between a- and p-half sclerotomes, we have adopted a novel gene expression-profiling strategy based on the analysis of expression microarrays of micro-dissected mouse sclerotome components. our results highlight the degree to which somite polarity at the cellular level is reflected by extensive molecular differences between the two somite halves.

RESULTS
to identify novel genes involved in the establishment and maintenance of the anterior-posterior  difference between the two halves of the sclerotome, we adopted a microarray-based expression-profiling approach. pilot experiments indicated that ~ <dig> pg of total rna could be isolated per sclerotome half . multiple sclerotome-halves were dissected as described in the methods and pooled as depicted in figure 2a. the pooling strategy was used for two reasons: first, to avoid inefficient amplification of sub-nanogram quantities of rna, and second, to minimize the variation in gene expression that might be caused by position-specific and somite-stage-specific differences in the samples.

to generate sufficient material for profiling by microarray, a global amplification method was designed to overcome the detrimental effects of high-cycle-number pcr amplification on transcript representation, and to alleviate inefficient amplification by in vitro transcription in the nanogram range   <cit> . this method employs an initial low-cycle-number pcr amplification using strand-switching pcr amplification approaches, followed by linear in vitro transcription and subsequent labelling of the amplified population. amplified rna was hybridised to the mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  genechip  as described in the methods. the raw image files and computed intensity data are available from arrayexpress .

differential gene expression in somites
to confirm that the embryo dissection and subsequent processing had accurately generated anterior- and posterior-half-sclerotome populations without significant cross-contamination, we analysed the microarray data for expression of genes that have been shown unequivocally in previous studies to be differentially-expressed between a- and p-half-sclerotome . the expression measures within the array data for  <dig> known differentially-expressed genes  were used for agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the arrays within the r statistical environment . this procedure makes no assumptions about the identity of individual arrays as anterior or posterior and allows monitoring of the relatedness of the arrays to each other. the dendrogram in figure  <dig> resulting from this analysis shows that each array separates into one of two distinct groups corresponding to its origin as a- or p-half-sclerotome. this pattern is distinct from that generated by clustering all genes on the array, and from that generated by clustering selected probe data sets that are not differentially-expressed . overall, these results indicate that all a-half-sclerotome samples are more closely related to all other such samples, and that all p-half-sclerotome samples are likewise more closely related to each other, so any cross-contamination is likely to be insignificant. differences between the two groups of array data are likely, therefore, to reflect significant molecular differences between a- and p-sclerotome-halves.

having confirmed the distinct anterior and posterior identity of the dissected samples, we estimated next the total number of genes differentially-expressed between anterior- and posterior-sclerotome-halves. we first ranked transcripts in terms of statistical certainty of differential expression between a- and p-halves using welch's t-test, and then examined the transcript distribution of the  <dig> known differentially-expressed genes described above. while many of these transcripts are evenly distributed across the rank-ordered transcript range, it is notable that more than one third are found at the low end of the p-value distribution, and that this is not observed with non-differentially-expressed somite-related genes . this suggests that our array analysis has a high probability of revealing differential expression. furthermore, visual inspection of the rank-order  suggests that there are as many as  <dig> genes with a high probability of differential expression. to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of differentially-expressed genes and additional statistical validation, fisher's exact score was used to determine the significance of enrichment of differentially-expressed genes within increasing group sizes amongst the rank-ordered transcripts relative to the genome as a whole. figure  <dig> demonstrates that the lowest p-value, which provides a minimum estimate of the total number of differentially-expressed genes between the anterior and posterior sclerotomes halves, corresponds to ~ <dig> transcripts. further examination of this graph  indicates again that there may be as many as ~ <dig> differentially-expressed genes, as p-values rise very rapidly for pool sizes greater than  <dig> .

of the  <dig> genes, we find that  <dig>  are expressed in the a-half-sclerotome while  <dig>  are expressed in the p-half-sclerotome. the relative proportions of a- and p- specific expression are in keeping with estimates from the literature suggesting that around  <dig> markers are differentially-expressed between a- and p-sclerotome with ~75% showing p-specific expression  <cit> . overall, this indicates that there are significant transcriptional differences between the two somite halves and also reveals a posterior bias of differential transcriptional activity between the a- and p-sclerotome-halves . our data further indicates that the total number of differentially-expressed genes may be some 8–30-fold higher than previously reported.

functional categorisation of candidate genes
to assess whether there are particular molecular processes significantly associated with either the a- or p-half-sclerotome genes, the database tool for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery was used with gene ontology consortium terms , biochemical pathways  and protein domain family names . additional file  <dig> lists all resulting terms for biological processes that show a significant probability of enrichment relative to the whole genome for the first  <dig> genes. while we have focused our discussion on statistically most reliable  and therefore necessarily more general categories in the ontological hierarchies, additional file  <dig> presents an extended list of terms from p < 10- <dig>  of note is the finding that there is nearly 2-fold enrichment within the p-half-sclerotome for expression of 'nuclear proteins' , much of which appears attributable to >2-fold over-representation of 'transcriptional regulators' . other enriched go terms in the p-half include ~2-fold enrichment in genes associated with 'metabolic regulators' , 'regulation of cellular physiological processes'  and 'nucleic acid binding' . a similar comparison of pfam families  supports such findings and also reveals several additional enriched categories in the p-half-sclerotome, including phosphorylation, showing a 3-fold enrichment , 'developmental protein', showing a  <dig> -fold enrichment  and 'membrane proteins' with a ~ <dig> -fold enrichment . in comparison with the p-half-sclerotome, the a-half-sclerotome shows little enrichment of functional categories with p < 10- <dig>  only the go term 'regulation of cellular process i' is found with a  <dig> -fold over-representation . it is of interest, from casual inspection of probabilities > 10- <dig>  that there is a posterior enrichment of genes involved in 'axon guidance', as well as 'udp-glycosyltransferase activity' which is required for axon repulsion mediated by p-half-sclerotome cells  <cit> . as the number of david ids associated with these terms is small some caution must be made in interpretation for less stringent p-values.

while the above analysis compares gene expression in the a- and p-half-sclerotomes relative to the whole genome, we also undertook a direct comparison of gene expression in a- versus p-half-sclerotome. a combination of blast  searches and the go database was used to assign a functional term to each of the  <dig> genes that are differentially-expressed between the two sclerotome halves. these terms were then grouped into  <dig> different categories . again, this reveals a higher proportion of genes involved in transcription expressed in the p-half-sclerotome relative to the a-half . furthermore, the number of p-half-enriched genes involved in signal transduction is more than double that for a-half-enriched genes  and include two members of the wnt family , two tgf pathway genes  and two mapk pathway genes . figure  <dig> also shows that there are more than three-fold as many genes with known developmental functions expressed in the p half-sclerotome compared with the a-half. in keeping with a bone/cartilage fate for the p-half sclerotome, it is notable that we find selective expression in the p-half of the master regulator of chondrogenic differentiation, sox <dig>  <cit> , as well as bmp <dig>  a member of the bone morphogenetic protein family.

further confirmation of differential gene expression
of the  <dig> known differentially-expressed genes,  <dig>  are found within the top  <dig> genes in our list. this analysis has revealed many more differentially-expressed genes, for which we sought independent confirmation by whole-mount in situ hybridisation . within the list of  <dig>  genes were prioritized according to the significance of their differential expression, using both significance analysis of microarrays  with a false discovery rate of 10%, and the bayesian cyber-t approach, with p < 10- <dig>  the original affymetrix probe sequences were obtained from netaffx , and blast was used to map sequences to ensembl gene identifiers using the ensembl genome-browser . after cropping the list of ambiguous and redundant entries, a revised list containing  <dig> entries was generated. additionally, the same analysis was applied to the genes in the range 176– <dig>  the region over which enrichment remained statistically highly significant, and generated a further list of  <dig> genes.

overall, we generated  <dig>  wish probes from the top  <dig> genes and  <dig>  probes from the next 176– <dig> genes. in situ hybridisation was performed on ts15- <dig>  embryos. the results for the top  <dig> candidates were classified into  <dig> groups based upon somite staining pattern: group  <dig>  unambiguous differential expression ; group  <dig>  very likely to be differentially-expressed ; group  <dig>  likely to be differentially-expressed ; and group  <dig>  non-staining or no differential expression ; see figure  <dig>  table  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  the equivalent results for the 176– <dig> genes are as follows: group  <dig> , group  <dig> , group  <dig> , group  <dig> . this shows that even within the range of candidates ranked from 176– <dig>  we can still detect a similar fraction of group  <dig> genes  compared with the candidates ranked from 1– <dig>  in summary, considering a candidate list from 1– <dig> as a whole, revalidation of the microarray candidates by in situ hybridisation indicates a positive rate of  <dig> % for groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> inclusive.

expression patterns were classified into  <dig> groups based upon somite staining: group  <dig> , group  <dig> , group  <dig> , and group  <dig> ; results from the 1– <dig> candidate range are shown. genes in the range 176– <dig>  with their respective ranking, are separated by a space and enclosed by square brackets .

in addition to wish, we applied a more sensitive, second revalidation procedure to a subset of these genes. pcr primers for real-time quantitative pcr  were designed for selected genes in each category, including  <dig> genes from group  <dig> . overall we obtained  <dig> pairs of primers that gave a regression coefficient of > <dig>  on a standard curve of dilution and a single peak on a dissociation curve. gene expression was calculated for 3– <dig> individual a- and p- half-sclerotomes . notably, as with the microarray data, the highest ratios of gene expression obtained using qpcr in a- and p-halves were for tbx <dig> and uncx <dig>  respectively. the ratios obtained for the most highly differentially-expressed transcripts within the microarray data were lower than for qpcr, suggesting that the rna amplification in array experiments may result in underestimation of gene expression differences. additionally, qpcr with two further control genes, sema3a and spondin <dig>  confirmed their expression as p-restricted.of the  <dig> genes typed by qpcr,  <dig>  showed two-fold or greater differential expression , while a further  <dig> genes show smaller but robust differences between a- and p-half-sclerotome . most significantly,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes assigned to the 'non-staining/no differential expression' group by wish, were re-assigned as differentially-expressed. another  <dig> of these  <dig> genes were amongst the group of  <dig> genes showing small but distinct differences between a- and p-half-sclerotome. this indicates that the initial wish screen is likely to underestimate the true proportion of differentially-expressed genes, which may actually be as high as 75%. in turn, of the original list of  <dig> genes, it is likely that at minimum  <dig> are differentially-expressed between a- and p-half-sclerotomes. moreover, since the qpcr-positive proportion of candidates within the top 175– <dig> genes is 15%, the absolute number of differentially-expressed genes is likely to be substantially higher.

discussion
recent studies of the molecular basis of somite development have emphasized the key roles played by the cyclical expression of genes in the presomite mesoderm, and also by counter-gradients along the a-p axis of signalling molecules  <cit> . in addition, a complex interaction of the transcription factor genes mesp <dig>  ripply <dig> and tbx <dig> has been shown to establish a-p somite polarity mesp <dig>  <cit> . our study has focussed on events that maintain polarity during sclerotome differentiation, after the initial appearance of somite polarity. consistent with this, mesp <dig>  ripply <dig> and tbx <dig> do not feature in our gene expression profiles. while numerous studies have focused on the differential expression of individual genes within the sclerotome halves, there has been no systematic attempt to characterize the overall molecular complexity in this system, and it has remained unclear whether many more differentially-expressed genes are required to maintain sclerotome polarity and differentiation. furthermore, the molecular basis of the well-known repulsion of spinal  axons by posterior-half-sclerotome has yet to be fully explained. the present study reveals a surprising degree of molecular heterogeneity between the two sclerotome halves, and highlights the potential complexity underlying an overtly simple embryonic pattern.

our approach has been to use microarray technology with limiting quantities of starting rna, followed by confirmation of candidacy for differential expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization and/or qpcr. it is interesting to compare our data with those of buttitta et al.  <cit> , who assessed gene expression in presomitic mesoderm versus newly-formed somites using much larger amounts of starting rna. the numbers of genes identified in the two studies  are broadly comparable, indicating that the use of much smaller starting quantities of rna in the present study has not compromised the ability to detect gene expression differences between highly related tissues. it is of note that, when wish is used as a secondary validation in both studies, there is a comparable reduction in the proportion of genes confirmed as differentially-expressed . this reflects the limitations of wish as a secondary validation procedure in these studies as the relative insensitivity of the method fails to distinguish lower levels of differential expression. while wish gives spatial expression information in the context of embryonic anatomy, our results suggest that qpcr should be used as an additional tool to validate true differential expression. in our hands, we detect differential expression for a large number of genes originally ascribed as being not differentially-expressed by wish.

we have uncovered a bias of differentially-expressed genes towards the p-half-sclerotome, with the over-representation of factors involved in transcriptional regulation, and of highly regulated cellular states such as phosphorylation and differentiation. collectively, this may indicate that the development of the p-half-sclerotome is a more complex and highly regulated process compared with a-half-sclerotome. while as expected, p-half-sclerotome differentially expresses markers of bone and cartilage differentiation , these are notably absent from a-cells. this finding strongly supports the hypothesis that the central a-half-sclerotome does not contribute bone and cartilage to the vertebral column, promoting instead the development of the segmental spinal nerves with associated sheath elements. the neural-associated fate of central-anterior cells stands in striking contrast to that of dorsal- and ventral-anterior cells, which are known contribute to the spinous process and vertebral body respectively  <cit> .

the dissected a-half sclerotomes used in our study will include a range of somite stages some of which will be expected to contain some neural crest cells that have begun to migrate within the sclerotome. consequently, neural crest-expressed genes should be present within the a-specific genes. in agreement with this, we found well-established neural crest markers, such as crabp <dig> and tcfap2/ap <dig>  <cit> , within the  <dig> a-half sclerotome genes. this would represent ~ <dig> % of the total a- specific genes. more detailed expression studies will be required to determine whether any more a-specific genes  are also found in neural crest. other known neural crest-specific genes, such as sox <dig>  <cit> , have not been revealed in our analysis. this might suggest that only a small proportion of neural crest cells are found within the dissected portion of the a-half-central sclerotome within the age-range of somites in our sample, thereby diluting the expression of neural crest markers with respect to all a-specific genes. furthermore, as our experiments examine expression differences between a and p-half-sclerotomes, neural crest markers that also have independent expression in the p-half will be necessarily be absent.

a key property of the p-half-sclerotome is to repel the outgrowth of neural crest cells and spinal nerve  axons, thereby generating spinal nerve segmentation  <cit> . candidate repellent molecules include members of the semaphorin and ephrin families, and our data have confirmed the p-specific expression of such molecules. however, several previous studies have also indicated that further p-specific repellents remain to be identified  <cit> , and our results provide a starting point in this direction. candidates warranting further investigation include the transmembrane semaphorin receptor component, plexina <dig>  which is prominently expressed in the p-half-sclerotome and the cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan, glypican-  <dig> . it is intriguing that n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase  <dig>  appears high in the candidate list  since this enzyme is essential for initiating o-glycosylation of glycoproteins, and p-specific expression of an o-glycosylated peanut agglutinin receptor protein is critical for axon repulsion mediated by p-half-sclerotome cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have profiled gene expression differences that define the regional differentiation of the somite-derived sclerotome into anterior and posterior halves. our data show that several hundred genes are differentially-expressed between the two halves. the results reveal a surprising degree of molecular heterogeneity that underlies the development of somite polarity, and indicate candidates for further investigation as regulators of somite polarity and vertebral morphogenesis, as well as repellents of spinal axon growth.
