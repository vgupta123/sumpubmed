BACKGROUND
homeobox genes, first identified to control development in drosophila species, encode highly conserved domains of about  <dig> amino acids, which comprise helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif  <cit> . homeobox genes are found in various organisms from yeast to vertebrates, and most homeodomain-containing proteins are believed to act as transcriptional factors  <cit> . in vertebrates, hox proteins participate in various differentiation programs such as limb development  <cit>  and also in regulating cell cycle, apoptosis and cancer  <cit> . in fungi, homeobox genes are best known to determine mating-types in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> , as well as in other fungi  <cit> . control of phosphate starvation response, hyphal formation, or cell cycle by homeobox genes has also been reported  <cit> .

in s. pom, there are three homeobox family genes; the mating type control gene matpi <cit> , yox1+ whose product is a regulator of g1/s transition of the cell cycle  <cit> , and phx1+ that was initially isolated as a high-copy suppressor of the growth defect caused by mutation in cu, zn-containing superoxide dismutase  production  <cit> . depletion of cuznsod caused lysine auxotrophy, and the overproduction of phx <dig> increased the synthesis of homocitrate synthase, the first enzyme in lysine biosynthetic pathway. since homocitrate synthase is labile to oxidative stress, it has been postulated that phx <dig> may serve as a transcriptional regulator that increases the fitness of s. pombe cells against oxidative stress  <cit> . however, no further information about the role of phx <dig> has been available. in this study, we examined the expression pattern of the phx <dig> gene, and its mutant phenotype to investigate its function. we found that phx <dig> plays an important role during the stationary phase when nutrients are low, enabling long-term survival, stress tolerance, and meiotic sporulation. supporting evidence for its action as a transcriptional regulator has also been presented.

RESULTS
phx <dig> is a homeodomain protein localized primarily in the nucleus
phx <dig> is a large protein of  <dig> amino acids , with conserved homeodomain . the homeodomain consists of a flexible stretch of several residues  followed by three α-helices  <cit> . multiple alignment of phx <dig> and other related proteins from yarroia lipolytica , podospora anserina , s. cerevisiae , and dictyostelium discoideum , indicates that the homeodomains are highly conserved, especially in the third helix . many eukaryotic homeodomain proteins with similar dna-binding motifs can bind the same dna sequences in vitro. however, these proteins function in different stages and regions, implying that their regulatory specificity can be determined through the combinational interaction with other transcriptional regulators. besides the homeodomain region, a small stretch of residues  was found to be conserved, sharing about 40% identical residues with the corresponding region of pho <dig>  interestingly, this region was reported to be involved in interaction with binding partners of pho2p such as pho4p, bas1p, and swi5p in s. cerevisiae <cit> . it implies that phx <dig> may have binding partners and related regulatory mechanisms as revealed in the action of transcription factor pho2p in s. cerevisiae.

in order to examine its expression and subcellular localization, we made a construct to encode phx <dig> with c-terminally fused gfp, by integrating the fused gene into the chromosome. cells were grown in edinburgh minimal medium  and examined for fluorescence at different growth phases. the gfp fluorescence began visible at late exponential phase and became very evident in the nucleus during the stationary phase . the nuclear localization of phx <dig> is in agreement with the genome-scale analysis data of protein localization in s. pombe <cit> .

phx <dig> contains the ability for transcriptional activation
many homeodomain-containing proteins are able to bind to dna and act as a transcription factor. in order to investigate the dna binding ability of phx <dig> protein, we purified the n- terminal polypeptide fragment containing homeodomain  as a fusion form with gst  from e. coli and examined whether it can bind to s. pombe genomic dna fragment. when phx1-nd-gst was bound to glutathione sepharose 4b column, s. pombe dna was retained in the column whereas nearly no retention was observed in the absence of protein, suggesting that phx <dig> is a dna-binding protein . however, the specificity of the bound dna was not readily extractable. in the absence of information on its specific target sequence, we moved on to find whether it has the ability to activate transcription when bound to a promoter region. for this purpose, we created a recombinant, where the n-terminal homeodomain region  of phx <dig> was swapped with the n-terminal dna binding domain  of pap <dig>  a well-studied transcription factor with known target genes  <cit>  . the chimeric protein was expressed from a multi-copy plasmid prep <dig> in s. pombe cells, and the level of pap1-dependent ctt1+ and trr1+ transcripts as well as pap1-independent gpx1+ gene was examined by northern analysis . as a control, rna samples from cells that express either the full-length  or c-terminal domain of phx <dig>  were analyzed in parallel. the results in figure 2b demonstrate that the chimeric construct that can bind to pap1-binding sites elevated transcripts of pap <dig> target genes  without affecting transcripts from pap1-independent gpx1+ gene. we separately confirmed that overproduction of pap <dig> in this strain increased the expression of trr1+ and ctt1+ genes by about  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, whereas that of gpx1+ was not significantly changed , when monitored by quantitative real-time pcr. these results indicate that the c-terminal two-thirds of phx <dig>  most likely contain a region that activates transcription when tethered nearby to the promoter. this supports the proposal that phx <dig> is likely to be a transcription factor. whether phx <dig> can act alone or needs interaction with other regulators remains to be elucidated.

expression of the phx1+ gene increases at the stationary phase and by nutrient starvation
to monitor the expression profile of phx1+, we analyzed phx1+ transcripts at different growth phases by northern blotting. as demonstrated in figure 3a, the level of phx1+ transcripts was very low during early and mid-exponential phases . however, the level sharply increased during late exponential phase when cells approached the stationary phase , and was maintained high during the stationary phase . this coincides with the fluorescence level from phx1-gfp , indicating that the level of phx <dig> protein is determined largely by its transcript level.

since cells enter the stationary phase when starved for nutrients  <cit> , we examined the effect of nutrient shift-down during the exponential growth. for this purpose, prototrophic wild-type cells grown to mid-exponential phase in emm were transferred to nitrogen-free emm  or to low glucose emm . the mrna levels of phx1+ were measured by quantitative real-time pcr  along with the control act1+ mrna. as demonstrated in figure 3b, the relative level of phx1+ mrna increased dramatically at earlier growth time in n-source or c-source limited conditions compared with the non-starved condition. these results indicate that the stationary-phase induction of phx1+ gene expression is due partly to nutrient starvation of n- or c-source.

the phx1+ gene is required for long-term survival during the stationary phase and under nutrient-starved conditions
as phx1+ gene is induced during stationary phase and by nutrient starvation, we investigated its role in cell survival under those conditions. for this purpose, Δphx <dig> null mutant was constructed and examined for its growth phenotype. the mutant strain did not show any significant difference in morphology, growth rate, or viability during the vegetative growth phase. however, when grown to the stationary phase in liquid emm, Δphx <dig> cells lost viability more quickly than the wild type when monitored by counting colony formation . this defect in long-term viability of Δphx <dig> mutant was rescued by ectopic expression of phx1+ . in addition, overproduction of phx <dig> in the wild-type strain greatly enhanced long-term viability . therefore, it is clear that phx <dig> confers cells with fitness during long-term cultures, enhancing their survival rates. when the long-term survival experiments of figure 4a were repeated with the strains  without auxotrophic markers, similar pattern was observed .

we then examined the viability of Δphx <dig> under nutrient-starved conditions. the wild type  maintained its viability for a longer period of time in n-starved medium. in comparison, Δphx <dig>  lost its viability at earlier time . in c-starved condition as well, Δphx <dig> lost its viability much quicker than the wild type . therefore, it appears clear that phx <dig> serves a critical role in conferring fitness to the stationary-phase cells or cells under nutrient starvation, and thus enables them to maintain viability for longer period of time. genetic studies have identified some genes that function in extending lifespan. in s. pombe, as in s.cerevisiae, camp/pka <dig> and sck <dig> signaling pathways have been shown to regulate chronological aging  <cit> . it has also been reported that respiration-defective mitochondrial dysfunction shortens chronological life span through elevating oxidative stresses  <cit> . whether phx <dig> is related with these signaling pathways and/or mitochondrial functions, and how, if it is, will be an interesting question to solve in the near future.

phx <dig> provides stress tolerance to oxidation and heat
it is widely accepted that cells in the stationary phase experience not only nutrient starvation, but also other stresses such as oxidation of cell components that include proteins and nucleic acids  <cit> . therefore, stationary-phase cells activate various stress defense systems, and this defense is critical for long-term survival. to find out whether phx <dig> is involved in tolerating various stresses other than nutrient starvation, we examined the sensitivity of Δphx <dig> mutant to various oxidants and heat. as exemplified in figure 5a Δphx <dig> mutant became sensitive to oxidants such as h2o <dig> , paraquat and menadione , diamide  and also to heat at 42°c. these results indicate clearly that phx <dig> confers fitness to cells not only during nutrient starvation but also under oxidative and heat stress conditions. we analyzed whether these stress conditions induce the expression of the phx1+ gene by analyzing its rna by qrt-pcr. the results in figure 5b demonstrate that these acute stresses indeed elevated the level of phx1+ mrna.

the Δphx1/Δphx <dig> diploid is defective in sporulation
when cells are starved of nutrients such as nitrogen or carbon sources, haploid yeast cells find other mating-type partners, conjugate to form diploids, which subsequently undergo meiotic division and sporulation. all of these sexual development processes are controlled by an extensive gene expression program  <cit> . a genome-wide analysis of s. pombe transcriptome has revealed that phx1+  is one of the genes that are highly induced during meiotic spore formation  <cit> . this led us to examine whether phx <dig> plays any role in meiosis. we first examined the mating efficiency of Δphx <dig> mutant cells. crossing h- and h+ haploid Δphx <dig> strains showed similar mating efficiency  to that of the wild type . crossing between the wild type and Δphx <dig> was similarly effective . this suggests that Δphx <dig> mutation does not significantly impair conjugation and diploid formation. therefore we obtained homozygous diploid strain Δphx1/Δphx <dig> and examined the formation of tetrad meiotic spores by incubating in emm. in comparison to the wild type, the mutant cells were very low in forming tetrad-containing asci, and mostly remained as cells with single large nucleus as monitored by dapi staining . therefore, it appears that Δphx1/Δphx <dig> diploid cells are defective in completing the first meiotic division  <cit> . the sporulation efficiency was determined by counting the number of asci among at least  <dig> cells counted. compared with the wild-type cells which demonstrated up to about 50% sporulation efficiency, the mutant diploids exhibited only about 10% efficiency .

CONCLUSIONS
phx <dig> is a homeobox-containing protein whose synthesis is elevated during the stationary phase. it resides primarily in the nucleus and contains the transcriptional activating ability when bound to dna, supporting its role as a transcriptional regulator. its synthesis is induced by nutrient starvation, various oxidative stresses, and by heat shock, coinciding with its role in long-term survival and stress resistance. it is also critically required for the formation of meiotic spores from diploid cells. taken all these observations together, it is quite clear that phx <dig> is a novel regulator that confers cells with fitness to survive during the nutrient-lacking stationary phase. it enhances viability and ability to form spores for the future, most likely through reprogramming gene expression pattern. elucidation of the signaling pathway as well as its target genes will be of interest to understand the mechanism of long-term survival and sporulation specific in this fungi as well as common across other organisms.
