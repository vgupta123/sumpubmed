BACKGROUND
regular exercise and high aerobic fitness both reduce the risk of cardiovascular- and metabolic-disease-related death for a multitude of potential reasons  <cit> . it is noteworthy that a very large intersubject variation exists when measuring the physiological adaptation to supervised exercise training  <cit> . while some subjects demonstrate a robust increase in aerobic capacity, others seem not to respond substantially at all  <cit> . this variation also applies to the improvement in insulin sensitivity seen after exercise  <cit> . such observations may be important for future cardiovascular health, as an inherent lack of 'trainability' associates with increased cardiovascular risk factors  <cit> . the mrna abundance for a huge number of genes  have been shown to be increased many hours after exercise training in humans  <cit> . however, only very recently have gene expression changes been related to the magnitude of physiological adaptation  <cit> . teran-garica and others  <cit>  observed a divergent mrna response in subjects that increase their insulin sensitivity most following endurance training, whereas we have demonstrated that the expression of insulin-like growth factor related genes were increased with training and more markedly in those subjects that most enhanced their aerobic capacity  <cit> . little else is known about the relationship between the extent of gene activation and the magnitude of physiological adaptation to exercise training in humans.

increased aerobic capacity following a period of intense endurance training reflects both central and peripheral adaptations  <cit> . activation of angiogenesis is presumably an important component of the response to endurance training  <cit> , indicating that substantial remodeling of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix  is required. using gene expression profiling, our knowledge of the many factors that regulate the extracellular environment and facilitate vascular remodeling following exercise has improved. alterations in vascular endothelial growth factor  and related receptor transcript expression occur following acute exercise and endurance training  <cit> , indicating that vegf may be an important exercise factor. more recently, the angiopoietin  signaling pathway has been shown to synergize with vegf  <cit>  and expression of both ang <dig> and ang <dig> is altered by intense aerobic training in rats  <cit> . there is currently no information on the physiological regulation of the ang system in human skeletal muscle following aerobic training. furthermore, the significance of changes in the abundance of transcripts from genes for various growth factors  <cit>  has not been examined in the context of changes in aerobic capacity resulting from endurance training.

we therefore set out to establish if greater improvements in systemic cardiovascular adaptation would be associated with changes in muscle gene expression. we did so by examining the expression responses of a number of tissue remodeling genes in subjects that demonstrated either a substantial  or a modest/negligible  response to training  <cit> . we also aimed to establish if the inclusion of low responders in a gene analysis study could yield misleading information on genes that might genuinely contribute to physiological adaptation to exercise in humans.

RESULTS
physiological parameters
growth factor-related genes
subjects in both groups underwent six weeks of endurance training. gene expression levels were then measured  <dig> h after the last training session. levels of vegf gene expression were not significantly altered in either group . likewise, levels of vegf receptor  <dig>  mrna did not significantly increase in the hrg and actually declined in the lrg . however, vegf receptor  <dig>  mrna expression increased by threefold in the hrg , whereas it did not significantly change in the lrg. similarly, mrna for the vegfr <dig> coreceptor neuropilin- <dig>  increased in the hrg  but not in the lrg . expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α  gene did not significantly change after endurance training. regulation by endurance training of ang-related genes was only observed in the hrg . levels of mrna coding for ang <dig>  an agonist for the tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and egf-like domains  <dig>  receptor, increased significantly in the hrg , although ang <dig> levels did not change significantly in either group. likewise, transcription of tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and egf-like domains  <dig>  and tie <dig> increased in the hrg only .

extracellular matrix growth factor binding genes
using our microarray dataset  <cit> , we selected ecm factors that  demonstrated evidence of being modulated by exercise training and  were relevant for ecm remodeling  <cit> . these genes included ones that encoded structural components of blood vessels  or known regulators of tissue angiogenesis , factors known to influence ecm-derived growth factor activity  and thrombospondin- <dig> ), transforming growth factor β <dig>  and tgfb receptor ii . the level of fetal vascular collagen  gene expression was increased  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold  in the hrg and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold in the lrg . the level of collagen type xvα <dig> expression increased in both groups: the hrg demonstrated a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold increase  while the lrg demonstrated a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold increase  in expression of the gene . in contrast, while both a2m and thbs <dig> were significantly upregulated in the hrg  and tenfold  increases, respectively), in the lrg the thbs <dig> response was more modest  and a2m mrna levels did not significantly change. tgfb <dig> was significantly upregulated in the hrg , whereas, if anything, it tended to be downregulated in the lrg . the level of tgfbr <dig> expression was unchanged in the lrg, but threefold increased in the hrg . finally, three genes unrelated to ecm biology but previously described as being modulated by exercise  <cit> , interleukin 17d, rho-gtpase-activating-protein  <dig> and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase c substrate, did not significantly vary in their expression between hrg and lrg .

discussion
classic alterations in skeletal muscle phenotype following physical training include improved fatigue resistance, enhanced aerobic capacity and greater insulin sensitivity  <cit> . the significance of an individual's ability to adapt to exercise training may ultimately influence multiple risk factors important for long term cardiovascular health  <cit> . in the present study we demonstrate for the first time that ang genes are substantially modulated in humans following a six-week aerobic training program. overall, many ecm-gene transcripts were only modulated in subjects that demonstrated a concurrent improvement in aerobic capacity. our data suggest that activation of ecm genes may help determine the cardiovascular adaptation to aerobic exercise in humans. the present findings also indicate that, when carrying out expression studies of gene transcripts in humans, prior to any interpretation of muscle gene expression responses, attention must be afforded to the presence of physiological adaptation.

modulation of genes that regulate extracellular matrix remodeling
we still have an incomplete understanding of the endogenous processes that regulate physiological adaptation to aerobic exercise. vascular growth factors not only regulate tissue blood vessel density, but also enhances the expression of proteins that regulate oxygen levels in tissue  <cit> . hence, it is naïve to think about the role of such growth factors only in terms of regulating tissue capillary density. altered expression of hif responsive genes  typically reflects the posttranslational stabilization of hif1α protein  <cit> , and consistent with this dogma, hif mrna was not significantly upregulated. vegfr <dig>  considered the major mediator of vegf-a-related angiogenesis, was significantly upregulated in the hrg only. furthermore, np- <dig>  a facilitator of vegf <dig> action at vegfr <dig>  was markedly elevated in the hrg and unchanged in the lrg . upregulation of the vegfr <dig> coreceptor transcript provides some evidence for greater vegf activity in the hrg, as enhanced np- <dig> gene expression can be mediated by vegf signaling  <cit> . the significance of the downregulation of vegfr <dig> in the lrg is unclear, but plausibly reflects an  compensation for the general lack of vegfr2/np- <dig> gene activation in the lrg, as studies indicate vegfr <dig> may oppose vegf signaling via vegfr <dig> in some situations  <cit> .

the present study represents the first characterization of expression levels of the human ang gene family in response to endurance-exercise training. recently, the terjung laboratory examined the impact of exercise on the angiopoietin system in rodents  <cit> . alterations in tie <dig>  ang <dig> and ang <dig> transcript expression were profiled  <dig> h post exercise in various muscle groups taken from sprague-dawley rats after  <dig> to  <dig> days of intense aerobic running  <cit> . in rodents, activation of tie <dig> and ang <dig> was, broadly speaking, rather similar across each muscle tissue, especially when one considers that recruitment patterns would differ between the various muscle groups studied. the ang <dig> response, however, differed both across muscle groups and when compared with our human data. in contrast with the upregulation of ang <dig> seen in humans in the hrg , in the rat ang <dig> expression was slightly downregulated in oxidative muscle groups, while 'fast' gastrocnemius demonstrated only a modest increase in ang <dig> expression  <cit> . it has recently been established that either pre-  <cit>  or concurrent administration  <cit>  of ang <dig> synergizes with vegf to promote hindlimb angiogenesis. thus it makes sense that effective aerobic training might result in stable increases in ang <dig> expression . therefore, differences between our human data and the rodent study by lloyd et al  <cit>  perhaps reflect differing muscle sampling times. future human studies should ideally use multiple time points post exercise to clarify these issues. however, care should be taken to verify that the subjects studied are able to demonstrate a measurable aerobic training response otherwise such results may be unreliable.

it has been hypothesized that changes in the ratio between levels of ang <dig> and ang <dig> is of physiological importance  <cit>  by contributing to the stabilization of the primary endothelial structures  <cit> . while ang1's ability to antagonize ang <dig> at the tie <dig> receptor may be cell-type specific  <cit>  and has yet to be proven to be important in vivo, it is interesting to note that ang <dig> and ang <dig> appear to have identical binding affinities for the tie <dig> receptor, whereas a threefold molar excess of ang <dig> is required to antagonize ang <dig> activity  <cit> . if the gene expression patterns observed in the present study translate to greater tie <dig> receptor signaling, then our data supports the idea that ang <dig> cooperates with other growth factors in vivo to regulate and promote functional angiogenesis. this hypothesis clearly requires further investigation. ang <dig> and tgfb signaling facilitate the maturation of vegf-stimulated collateral vessel growth in adult tissue  <cit> . notably, tgfb <dig> and tgfbr <dig> were substantially upregulated only in the hrg. this observation again suggests that the ecm-related gene response in the hrg may have allowed for greater tissue remodeling, which would have contributed to the fourfold greater increase in aerobic capacity.

to further examine the idea that the pattern of transcript expression in the hrg contributed to the enhanced aerobic adaptation, we profiled a second set of genes chosen from a gene-array study  <cit> . for example, upregulation of potent growth factors should be accompanied by upregulation of endogenous regulators, so that physiological control could be maintained. a2m is an ecm protein known to bind and regulate growth factor activity  <cit> . a2m was substantially upregulated in the hrg only  suggesting that there was more active growth factor signaling within the ecm of the hrg. thrombospondins also regulate ecm growth factors, including tgfb activity. in addition, a loss of function polymorphism in thbs <dig> is strongly associated with premature coronary artery disease  <cit> . in the present study a more substantial increase in thbs <dig> mrna expression was noted in the hrg . as dysfunction of thbs <dig> and lack of cardiorespiratory fitness are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease, it is plausible that thbs <dig> plays a role in the cardioprotective effects of exercise. further analysis is required to establish if such a relationship exists within a larger human population.

CONCLUSIONS
there was unquestionably a differential physiological response between the groups, as the hrg increased their aerobic capacity by, on average,  <dig>  l min- <dig>  whereas the lrg did not significantly increase their aerobic capacity . at this time, our data cannot directly attribute cause-and-effect for the differentially responding genes. although we profiled changes in skeletal muscle ecm-related gene expression changes, we are not implying that only the local  role of these genes contributes to the magnitude of the training adaptation. it is entirely plausible that the observed difference between our cohorts reflects a genotype-dependant response, which would impact on gene expression in a range of tissues important for cardiovascular adaptation to endurance-exercise training. importantly, histological analysis of muscle would not address this possibility. instead, we would suggest that these differentially expressed genes represent reasonable candidates for future polymorphism studies in larger populations. our data also demonstrates that direct evidence for physiological adaptability must be presented prior to concluding that gene transcript alterations may or may not occur during the physiological adaptation to exercise.
