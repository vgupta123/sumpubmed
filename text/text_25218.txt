BACKGROUND
adaptive radiations, groups that have rapidly diversified from a common ancestor to exploit a wide suite of ecological niches, have intrigued evolutionary biologists for over a century  <cit> . considered as important biodiversity engines, these bursts of speciation are thought to arise from ecological opportunity in the form of vacant ecological niches that become available due to the colonization of new environments  or the acquisition of adaptive innovations that allow the access to novel niche dimensions   <cit> . spatial and/or ecological dispersal can be driven by modifications of existing environments via climatic changes  <cit> . when lineages first enter these new adaptive zones, morphological evolution should initially be rapid; as niche spaces become increasingly saturated, the rate of morphological evolution would be expected to slow down  <cit> . a core prediction based on the above scenario  is the existence of early rapid diversification followed by a slowdown in net diversification over time . thereby, lineage and morphological diversification are frequently positively correlated  <cit> , but the opposite pattern  has also been reported  <cit> . nevertheless, recent studies have shown that processes underlying phenotypic disparity and those generating species diversity can be uncoupled, suggesting that ecological opportunity is not the only diversification force . for example, speciation by simple geographic isolation can generate a pattern of declining speciation trough time without the intervention of niche-filling processes  <cit> . on the other hand, speciation bursts can occur in multiple pulses linked to environmental changes , thus eroding the diversity-dependent signature of diversification. this may explain why a large number of studies performed on radiating clades have failed to detect early-bursts of phenotypic evolution, despite some of them represent the most classic examples of adaptive radiation, including darwin’s finches from the galapagos islands and anolis lizards of the caribbean islands .

recently, it has been recognized that there are many different types of evolutionary radiations and not all adaptive radiations conform to the early-burst model  <cit> . for example, under a repeated radiation scenario, it is expected that subclades tend to resemble each other in morphological disparity and, contrary to that predicted under the early-burst paradigm, morphological evolution should not necessarily be initially rapid. this kind of adaptive radiation  may arise in systems dominated by constraints, such as when evolution within clades is driven by repeated adaptation to similar environments . this model of radiation exemplifies that episodes of ecological opportunity can be recurring over the evolutionary history of a lineage  <cit> . beyond the epithet “adaptive”, non-adaptive radiations  constitute another form of radiation that remains largely unstudied . non-adaptive radiations arise through processes that are unrelated to niche exploitation and the resulting species usually exhibit low morphological disparity and allopatric distributions  <cit> . for example, non-adaptive radiations driven by sexual selection result in new species that are ecologically similar to their ancestors such are the case of hawaiian laupala crickets  <cit> . the boundaries of adaptive and non-adaptive radiations are sometimes diffuse and it has been suggested that both processes are extremes along a continuum  <cit> . thus, some lineages may exhibit features consistent with these two concepts  <cit> .

striking radiations showing extraordinary phenotypic divergence, most of them comprising clades with restricted geographic distributions such as islands or ancient lakes, are over-represented in the literature on evolutionary radiations  <cit>  . conversely, there is a paucity of studies analyzing the tempo and mode of trait evolution on species-rich clades that present little phenotypic disparity and that are more common among continental radiations. in this sense, recent radiations with limited morphological variability provide valuable case-studies for a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that drive speciation . however, despite of morphostatic radiations are likely not the exception but the rule within many groups such as invertebrates, this form of radiation remains largely unstudied. short-horned grasshoppers , a superfamily that comprises over  <dig> species  <cit> , provide an excellent opportunity to study disparification dynamics in an evolutionary radiation exhibiting little apparent adaptive phenotypic disparity. according to a recent study, this group seems to have undergone a significant increase in diversification rate with little extinction, with the major diversification events occurring during the cenozoic after the cretaceous-paleogene boundary  <cit> . song and colleagues  <cit>  suggested that the emergence of a new niche space  during the cenozoic and the subsequent colonization of new habitats may have prompted an explosive adaptive radiation in short-horned grasshoppers. later, during the pleistocene, the most speciose acridid subfamily  may have undergone one or several independent radiations due to the evolution of complex species-specific acoustic signals in different clades  <cit> . contrary to that predicted under the adaptive radiation model, short-horned grasshopper species do not seem to exhibit remarkable morphological adaptations to different feeding habitats and environments. the existence of a low degree of morphological variation does not necessarily imply an absence of adaptation to different microhabitats. for example, plethodontid salamanders show limited morphological diversification in spite of presenting an extensive array of ecotypes ranging from arboreal to aquatic or fossorial species  <cit> . nevertheless, acridid grasshoppers seem to be rather conservative in microhabitat usage and, probably, the main differentiating factor among species is the substrate type wherein they perch; some species can be found on the plant canopy whereas others remain on the ground. although most studies have focused on the relationship between microhabitat and morphology , it is likely that, at a finer scale, substrate type can also impose different selective pressures leading to the evolution of more or less subtle morphological and behavioral adaptations. the ability of species to exploit a range of habitats  could be also correlated to key morphological traits like forelimb length or cranial morphology as evidenced by studies on other taxa .fig.  <dig> the axes of evolutionary radiation. clades can show  strong phenotypic and ecological disparity like anolis lizards or hawaiian honeycreepers. some clades  exhibit low morphological disparity despite of they have a wide variety of ecotypes  whereas others  present considerable phenotypic disparity, but little ecological disparity  suggesting a prominent role of sexual selection  as driving force in the speciation process. clades  with limited morphological diversification and low ecological disparity  constitute the most extreme cases along these axes and therefore, they have been frequently regarded as non-adaptive radiations




in the present study, we used a time-calibrated phylogeny of  <dig> species of iberian short-horned grasshoppers to test for patterns of morphological disparity in relation to their ecology and phylogenetic history. specifically, we aimed at testing whether the major morphological changes occurred early in the acridid’s diversification history or if random-walk patterns  or other processes  have driven the diversification of phenotypic attributes in this group. we also examined the potential role of substrate use and the level of ecological specialization  in shaping morphological attributes  in this invertebrate radiation. if substrate type and ecological specialization imposes a selective pressure across taxa, it would result in the same solution -phenotypic optima- multiple times, leading to convergence among species even between distantly-related clades.

methods
taxon sampling
the iberian peninsula is renowned for its high level of biodiversity and number of endemic species, and also as one of the main refugial areas in europe during the pleistocene ice ages  <cit> . most of species included in this study are endemic to the iberian peninsula or have a distribution restricted to iberia, france and north africa. our dataset included  <dig> taxa of short-horned grasshoppers belonging to four different subfamilies; slant-faced grasshoppers , band-winged grasshoppers , spur-throated grasshoppers  and  <dig> spp. belonging to different subfamilies  . our dataset accounts for around three quarters of all extant species of acridid grasshoppers that have been recorded in the iberian peninsula  <cit> . iberian acridids do not descend from a single common ancestor and, thus, they do not constitute a local radiation in this region, but a paraphyletic group  <cit> . however, it should be noted that several recent studies have pointed out that analyses of adaptive radiation do not require to include all descendants of a particular common ancestor, as such requisite is overly restrictive . in fact, no theory of adaptive radiation predicts monophyly  <cit> .

phylogeny reconstruction
we sequenced four mitochondrial gene fragments: cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> , nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> , 12s rrna  and a fragment containing parts of 16s rrna . for some taxa we failed to obtain reliable sequences, so we complemented our dataset with sequences obtained from previous studies  <cit> . sequences were aligned in mafft online version  <dig>  <cit>  and concatenated using sequencematrix  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . we calculated the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution for each of the four genes using jmodeltest  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the tim2 + i + Γ substitution model was selected for 12s, gtr + i+ Γ for 16s, trn + i+ Γ model for nd <dig> and tpm3uf + i+ Γ was selected for coi. more details about these procedures are given in  <cit> .

phylogenetic inference was carried out under both maximum likelihood  and bayesian frameworks. maximum likelihood analyses were conducted with two search replicates and  <dig> bootstrap replicates using garli version  <dig>   <cit> . bayesian inference analyses were conducted in beast  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  in order to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny. we used an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed-clock model and applied a yule process as tree prior. two calibration points were used in order to calibrate the tree based on absolute times. we employed as a first calibration point the split between gomphocerinae and oedipodinae, estimated to have occurred ~ <dig> mya ago. this estimate is based on dated ancient cockroach fossils  <cit> . as a second calibration point, we used the divergence between sphingonotus azurescens  and s. guanchus , whose divergence is estimated to have occurred around  <dig>  mya  <cit> . sphingonotus guanchus was only included in beast analyses for calibration purposes. note that dating should be treated with caution as our calibrations are based on previous estimates. we ran analyses for a total of 100 ×  <dig> generations, with a sampling frequency of  <dig> generations. we ensured that replicated analyses converged  using tracer  <dig> . <dig>  tree and log files  of the two runs were combined with logcombiner  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and the maximum clade credibility  tree was compiled with treeannotator  <dig> . <dig>  the obtained tree topologies were rather similar and consistent with previous studies  <cit> . see  <cit>  for more details.

morphometric analyses
i) locomotory morphology
our dataset included  <dig> preserved specimens representing  <dig> to  <dig> male adults for  <dig> species of short-horned grasshoppers. we gathered a dataset of five morphological attributes of known correlation with locomotor performance and ecology  <cit> . morphological measurements included:  structural  body length,  tibia length,  femur width,  femur length, and  forewing  length. all measurements were taken by the same observer  using a zeiss stereomicroscope . because disparity in body size and level of sexual size dimorphism has been addressed in a previous study  <cit>  and the former trait  is strongly correlated with other morphological variables, we size-corrected the remaining four variables using structural body length as size measurement. the relative length and relative width of the femur are inversely correlated , so we calculated a width/length femur ratio. as a result, our final dataset was composed of three variables related with locomotory morphology: tibia length, femur width/length ratio and tegmina length. tegmina are modified leathery forewings present in some insects like grasshoppers. the major role of this structure is that of protecting the hindwings . these also have an aerodynamic function and thus can be considered an informative trait about the dispersal potential of a species  <cit> . on the other hand, leg length is thought to determine the jumping performance of insects like grasshoppers, leafhoppers and froghoppers . thus, relative femur length can provide information on jumping ability in insects that use a catapult-like mechanism to jump. we performed a phylogenetic principal component analysis  on these three variables using the r package phytools  <cit> . the phylogenetic principal component analysis yielded a single principal component  that explained  <dig> % of the variance of our three morphological variables . the positive extreme of ppclm represents species with short wings and tibiae and thicker femora , and the negative extreme of this axis represents species with large wings and tibiae and more stylized femora . we also implemented a non-phylogenetic principal component analysis  as a recent study has suggested that using phylogenetic pc axes as trait data could bias results  <cit> . however, we found similar results by using both approaches .

ii) antenna length
in conjunction with variables directly related to locomotor performance we also measured antenna length in a similar way as described above. antenna length was corrected for body size, so we refer to relative antenna length hereafter. members of the family acrididae show relatively short and stout antennae in comparison with crickets and katydids. however, the length of antennae largely differs among taxa and these differences may be linked to the diet and degree of ecological specialization of each species  <cit> . acridid grasshoppers recognize their host plant by sensorial stimuli, which are perceived through chemoreceptors located on the labrum and antennae  <cit> . chemosensory sensilla on antennae express two classes of proteins involved in the recognition of odors and taste, and thus the antennae are thought to play an important role in host orientation and food selection  <cit> . in this vein, we would expect a greater development of this structure in taxa with a narrower ecological niche  and species preferring to perch on plants, which may display higher sensitivity to plant odour perception  <cit> .

iii) head shape
different selective pressures linked to a plethora of factors both intrinsic  and extrinsic  can play a role in driving the evolution of head shape. the functional trade-offs that shape head morphology may be related to foraging, locomotory and anti-predator strategies, which may differ among species that move in different microhabitats, for example, between species that climb vertical structures and ground-dwelling taxa  <cit> . here, we aimed at examining head shape variation in relation to ecological factors and phylogenetic history. to that end, we photographed a total of  <dig> specimens  using a zeiss stereomicroscope and the zeiss image analysis software . we established the scale and digitalized landmarks from each photograph using the function ‘digitize2d’ in the r package geomorph  <cit> . we selected  <dig> homologous landmarks which capture the outline of the head and the size and relative position of the eyes . these landmarks were subjected to a generalized procrustes analysis  wherein all specimens are translated to the origin, scaled to unit centroid size and optimally rotated until the coordinates of corresponding points align as closely as possible  <cit> . the resulting coordinates in the tangent space represent the head shape  of each specimen. from these coordinates, we calculated an average set of landmark coordinates for each of the  <dig> species. we averaged each x- and y-coordinate, also calculating the species’ average centroid size. we then performed a pca on the aligned procrustes coordinates using the function ‘plottangentspace’ in geomorph. the first two pc  accounted for  <dig> % of shape variation in the sample . we inspected how head shape was related to the log of centroid size  using the function ‘procd.allometry’. head shape and centroid size did not show a linear relationship and thus, the allometric component of our data can be considered negligible.fig.  <dig> scatterplot of the two first principal components of head shape variation . green and brown circles indicate plant-perching and ground-perching species, respectively. thin-plate spline deformation grids for the two most extreme cases relatives to the overall reference shape  are shown. a picture illustrating the position of the  <dig> landmarks used to characterize head shape variation is also represented in the right-bottom corner of figure




ecological data
we aimed to examine the evolutionary relationship between grasshopper morphology  and substrate type. for this purpose, we categorized each species on the basis of substrate preference  from the literature  and our own personal observations. in addition, we examined the association between our morphological variables and the level of ecological specialization . ecological specialization refers to the ability of a species to exploit a range of resources and its capacity to use each one as result of evolutionary trade-offs . here, we used the ‘paired difference index’  as an estimator of ecological specialization  <cit> . pdi values were calculated from a species-habitat matrix in which we rated the level of association of each species  with the nine most common habitats in which the studied species can be found. the pdi is a robust specialization index which takes into account not only the number of resources used by a species, but also the strength of the association between the species and its resources  <cit> . scores of species-habitat association were obtained directly from the literature and our own personal observations. pdi values were computed using the r package bipartite  <cit> .

phylogenetic comparative analyses
we assessed the phylogenetic signal of our focal variables  in order to test if these traits tracked the evolutionary history of the group and were not randomly distributed across taxa. we computed pagel’s lambda  for the first two principal components of head shape , and for the two remaining variables, locomotory morphology  and relative antenna length, in phytools  <cit> . pagel’s λ can take a value from  <dig>  which means that phylogeny has no impact on the distribution of the trait and the values can be treated as independent, to a value of  <dig>  which means that phylogeny fully predicts the distribution of the trait. we then mapped the evolution of these continuous traits on our phylogeny by using the function ‘contmap’ in phytools, which estimates states at internal nodes using ml and interpolates the states along each edge following  <cit> .

we examined the association between the two ecological factors  and our morphological variables . first, in order to test if substrate type  has influence on these variables, we performed phylogenetic anovas using the function ‘phy.anova’  in the r package geiger  <cit> . because substrate type largely varies among subfamilies  we performed a second phylogenetic anova only including gomphocerinae species . thereby, we assessed the influence of substrate type on morphology while controlling for the non-independence of the data because of shared ancestry. secondly, we analyzed the relationship between our morphological variables and the level of ecological specialization  using phylogenetic generalized least squares . pgls regression analyses were performed using the caper package  <cit>  and graphically visualized by means of phylogenetically independent contrasts  computed using the pdap:pdtree module in mesquite v. <dig>   <cit> .

disparity analyses
in order to visualize the relationship between phylogeny and taxon distribution in the morphological space, we built a ‘phylomorphospace’, which projects the branches of a phylogenetic tree into a 2d morphospace defining trait variation among species  <cit> . when subclades occupy limited morphospace it means that most disparity is accounted for by early divergence , while if subclades occupy large regions of the morphospace  it means that morphological diversity  is largely explained by recent divergence. we generated a phylomorphospace by plotting head shape against locomotion morphology  using phytools  <cit> . we also generated a second morphospace from the two first principal components for head shape .

we investigated how morphological disparity has accumulated over the group’ evolutionary history. we evaluated the rate of morphological evolution in relation to lineage diversification by means of disparity-through-time  analyses  <cit> , as implemented in the geiger package  <cit> . we compared observed relative disparity with average phenotypic disparity simulated under brownian motion  in order to test whether disparity was accumulated during the early or recent history of the group. when the rate of morphological evolution is constant, as expected under bm, the dtt curve is expected to decline linearly toward zero through time. under an early-burst model, disparity will decline sharply and much earlier, while if evolution within subclades is fast the observed dtt curve will fall above the brownian profile. in order to quantify the magnitude of the difference between the null disparity profile computed under bm, and the observed disparity profile from our data, we computed the so-called morphological disparity index  statistic using the geiger package  <cit> . a positive mdi value is indicative of greater than expected subclade disparity  whereas negative mdi values indicate greater than expected subclade disparity . a negative mdi is characteristic of adaptive radiations, as rapidly diversifying taxa are expected to evolve distinct morphologies in response to new adaptive zones and slow once niches are filled. dtt analyses were performed twice; by including all taxa and only including species of the subfamily gomphocerinae. we then ran a node height test  <cit> , which tests for accelerations or decelerations in trait evolution, by comparing the independent contrasts for a trait with the respective node height . a significant negative relationship between absolute contrast value and node age supports the hypothesis of adaptive radiations as it would imply that species are dividing niche space more finely through time, consistent with a niche-filling model. node height tests were performed using the r package caper  <cit> .

tempo and mode of morphological evolution
evolutionary models are conceived to infer the different possible processes shaping phenotypic evolution and provide a method of testing different predictions regarding the tempo and mode of evolution. we assessed the fit of four evolutionary models to our phenotypic variables using the functions ‘fitcontinuous’ and ‘ouwie’ implemented in the r packages geiger  <cit>  and ouwie  <cit> , respectively. we fitted three different single-rate models; brownian-motion , early-burst  and single-optimum ornstein-uhlenbeck , and a multi-peak ornstein-uhlenbeck model. brownian-motion  operates under the assumption that trait evolution proceeds a random walk wherein trait variance across lineages accumulates proportional to time . the early-burst  model predicts rapid morphological disparity early in the radiation, followed by a slowdown in the diversification rate as ecological niches are filled over time  <cit> . support for the single-optimum ou model  would imply that there is a single phenotypic optima  for all taxa. this model is often associated with a process of stabilizing selection in which variation of phenotypic traits revolves around one or more stationary peaks  <cit> . lastly, we assessed the fit of a multivariate ou model  with separate morphological optima and separate random walk variances  for each substrate guild , and one global parameter , which determines the strength of selection towards those optima. for the multi-peak ou model we determined the possible ancestral substrate regimes along the internal branches of the phylogenetic tree using the stochastic mutational mapping on phylogenies  tool in phytools, and sampled  <dig> character histories in order to incorporate evolutionary uncertainty. we compared the fit of the bm, eb, ou <dig> and oumv models using the akaike information criterion corrected for small sample size , which can be employed to compare models that differ in the number of parameters and therefore have non-comparable likelihoods.

RESULTS
phylogenetic signal and ancestral state reconstruction
all morphological variables except pchs <dig> showed a significant phylogenetic signal suggesting conservative evolution for these traits . visual simulation of trait evolution using ancestral character reconstruction confirmed this pattern; species in the same subfamily tend to share morphological traits . however, within oedipodinae, there is a greater morphological variability than in the gomphocerinae group.

ecology-morphology association
we found a marginally significant correlation between the relative length of antennae and the level of ecological specialization ; specialist species tend to have larger antennae than generalist species . there was no significant association between either head shape  or locomotory morphology  and the level of ecological specialization .fig.  <dig> relationship between relative antenna length and level of ecological specialization  in short-horned grasshoppers represented in the form of standardized phylogenetic independent contrasts 




we found a significant effect of substrate type on head shape   indicating that plant-perching species exhibit a more conical head in comparison with ground species. however, when restricting our analyses to the gomphocerinae subset, we did not find significant differences in head shape between both groups . this suggests that differences in head morphology between substrate types are mainly due to most of oedipodinae being “ground-dwelling” taxa whereas most gomphocerinae species are adept climbers that prefer to perch on plants instead of remaining on the ground. regarding locomotory morphology , we detected marginally significant differences between plant-perching and ground-dwelling species ; the former tend to exhibit larger tibiae and larger and thinner femora than ground-dwelling species, which possess a more stout morphology . this difference remained marginally significant even when restricting our analyses to the gomphocerinae subfamily ; gomphocerine species that prefer to stay on the ground exhibit a slightly different locomotory morphology  in comparison with gomphocerine perching on plants. there were no significant differences in relative antenna length between ground and plant-perching species for either the entire dataset  or the gomphocerinae subset .fig.  <dig> differences  in locomotory morphology between plant-perching and ground-perching species when considering all taxa  and only including gomphocerinae species 




disparity analyses
phylomorphospace plots of pchs versus ppclm and of pchs versus pchs <dig> indicate a moderate phylogenetic structuring of taxon distribution in the phenotypic space . we projected our phylogeny onto a plot defined by the first axis of head shape  and the pc axis representing variation in locomotory morphology . we found that catantopinae and calliptaminae occupy a unique region of morphospace at the positive extreme of ppclm, characterized by relatively small and stout limbs, whereas gomphocerinae and oedipodinae species showed a broader distribution along the morphospace . within the 2-dimensional space defined by pchs versus pchs <dig>  we observed that the first axis, which represents variation between an elongated  to a straight head shape , separates most of gomphocerine species from the rest of taxa . when discerning between both substrate types, we observed that plant-perching species  are more abundant in the right-side of the morphospace while ground species  tend to occupy the left-side .fig.  <dig> phylomorphospace plot of head shape variation  against locomotory morphology variation . dots show mean values for each acridid species and colors indicate clade membership . black lines show phylogenetic relationships among species. for illustrative purposes, b. tryxalicerus  was not represented in the phylomorphospace but a scatterplot of pchs vs. ppclm including this species is provided in additional file 1





the dtt analyses yielded positive mdi statistics for all morphological variables , however the differences between both profiles were not statistically significant in either case . it means that trait evolution did not significantly deviate from a bm model, which prevents us to state that disparity is concentrated within subclades . for head shape, we found a higher pulse of trait disparification during the paleogene, which is in agreement with previous studies in which it has been suggested that major lineages of acrididae went through a major radiation in the cenozoic  <cit> . in all cases we observed a departure of the observed dtt curves from bm expectations beyond the 95% confidence interval during the pleistocene suggesting rapid acceleration in morphological diversification during this period. when restricting our analyses to this period  we obtained again positive mdi values in all cases , which implies that due to niche evolution subclades overlap , and all contain a significant proportion of variation found through the gomphocerinae group at a given time. the node-height test resulted in a positive but non-significant relationship between the absolute values of standardized length contrasts and node age for all morphological traits .fig.  <dig> disparity-trough-time plots for head shape , locomotory morphology  and relative antenna length . disparity profiles are indicated by solid black lines, average brownian-motion simulation by dashed black lines, and 95% confidence intervals from  <dig>  bm simulations by light blue polygons




tempo and mode of morphological evolution
results from the multivariate model fitting analysis support stabilizing selection  as the most plausible evolutionary scenario for our morphological data . according to the obtained aicc values, the oumv model provides the best fit to head shape evolution  followed by the bm model and lastly the ou <dig> and the eb models . this means that head shape diversification may be driven by adaptive constraints, although a constant rate model could not be discarded. indeed, when models of head shape evolution were tested exclusively on the gomphocerinae, bm provided the best fit for the observed pattern . divergence of locomotion attributes was also best described by an oumv model , which suggests that acridid body morphology is tied to substrate type. this result was confirmed when restricting our analyses to the gomphocerinae dataset, which allowed us to distinguish ancestral from derived similarity . however, a single-peak ou model could not be excluded in this latter analysis. regarding relative antenna length, the evolution of this trait was better described by a single-peak ou model either considering all species or restricting the analyses to gomphocerinae .table  <dig> comparison of four evolutionary model fits, random-walk variances  and primary trait optima  for the three morphological variables: head shape , locomotory morphology  and relative antenna length

discussion
like some examples of non-adaptive radiations , acridid grasshoppers tend to retain a rather conserved body plan with little overt ecomorphological specialization among taxa . however, we observed a greater morphological disparity within oedipodinae in comparison with that observed for the gomphocerinae, suggesting that the level of morphological resemblance among species differ between the two subfamilies. gomphocerinae  constitute a very recent radiation, which is suspected to be mostly the result of divergent evolution of isolated populations induced by climatic oscillations during the pleistocene  <cit> . some gomphocerine species spread out from southern refugia and expanded their ranges northwards during interglacials, whereas many others  became restricted to high altitudes  due to their limited dispersal capacity  <cit> . hence, many iberian species probably arose in association with these mountain ranges . at a smaller scale, the evolution of elaborate acoustic signals as premating reproductive isolation mechanisms  may have allowed gomphocerine grasshoppers to diversify in regions in which ecologically similar and phylogenetically related species coexist  <cit> . thus, it is likely that both divergence in allopatry  <cit>  and prezygotic isolation mechanisms  <cit>  have played a crucial role in promoting speciation in this subfamily. however, our results should be interpreted cautiously because the present study assesses the dynamic of morphological evolution among a small fraction of the acrididae’ overall diversity. thus, our findings may reflect local processes  rather than global mechanisms that operate across the entire clade.

patterns of morphological disparity through time
our results do not support the existence of an early-burst of phenotypic diversification, adding to the number of study-cases showing no support for this evolutionary model  <cit> . obtained mdi values indicate that substantial amount of variance is clustered within subclades, pointing out to the existence of low phylogenetic niche conservatism. that is, there was no tendency of closely related species to be more similar to each other in ecomorphological traits than they are to more distant relatives as expected if some processes had constrained niche divergence among phylogenetically close species  <cit> . this is in contrast to that predicted for taxa that experience early-bursts of diversification, where the partitioning of morphological disparity through time  is expected to be low  <cit> . overall, dtt plots showed a general tendency for relative disparity in phenotypic attributes to decrease over time, but with two main pulses of increases in disparification during the cenozoic and the pleistocene. the observed pattern is not consistent with that predicted under an iterative radiation scenario wherein it should be expected the appearance of repeated diversification peaks  <cit> . the fact that acridids partitioned morphological disparity within rather than among clades suggests that acridid lineages did not evolve along distinct morphological trajectories through time. thus, it is unlikely that acridid lineages explored different adaptive zones, which makes sense taking into account the limited morphological variability they exhibit.

evolutionary models of morphological divergence
overall, results from the multivariate model fitting analysis summarized in table  <dig> favored an ornstein-uhlenbeck model, indicating bounded evolution around a single  or two phenotypic optima . specifically, in relation to head shape, we found that a single model does not uniquely explain the evolution of this trait for the entire dataset; bm and oumv were similarly informative. however, when models of evolution were tested exclusively on the gomphocerinae subset, bm was the most informative model. it suggests that head shape evolution displays an idiosyncratic component and that, irrespective of substrate on which they rest, gomphocerinae species have a more conical head shape in comparison with band-winged grasshoppers due to their phylogenetic legacy. on the other hand, our results indicate that locomotory morphology in acrididae is inconsistent with a bm process, and has not evolved under a constant rate over time. a multivariate-peak ou  model provided the best fit in both cases , which means that the evolution of this trait revolves around adaptive peaks.

in this context, it is possible that biomechanical constraints, which underlie much of locomotory morphology variation, impose restrictions on morphological diversification . specifically, our results suggest that stabilizing selection pulls the locomotory morphology towards two convergent adaptive optima  during the group’s evolutionary history. a key difference between the two substrate type regimes in terms of locomotory attributes relies on the different degree of development of femora  and wings  that each guild of species exhibit . interestingly, we observed a negative relationship between relative forewing length and relative femur width/length ratio in gomphocerinae  pointing out to the existence of a trade-off between flying- and jumping-based dispersal investments in this group. with regard to antenna length, a single-peak ou model was the model that provided the best fit to the observed data, suggesting that antennae evolution has remained constrained by directional selection.

ecology-morphology association
we investigated the role of substrate type and level of ecological specialization in driving morphological evolution in our study group. the variation in structural characteristics within the habitat  has direct effects on animal locomotion and can lead to the evolution of morphological and behavioral adaptations   <cit> . for example, stick insects  of new caledonia and new guinea  are ground-dwelling species and show a distinct ecomorph; they are flightless and exhibit a stocky body form and thick hind legs. this is in contrast with the majority of stick insects, which are solitary canopy-dwellers and show an instantly recognizable morphology   <cit> . in particular, substrate type may be especially important for small animals that jump using a catapult-like system such as grasshoppers and leafhoppers  <cit> . here, we found that plant-perching grasshoppers tend to exhibit a slender morphology in comparison with those species that prefer to stay on the ground, which show a more compressed body . this result is consistent with that reported by  <cit>  in a study with leafhoppers. these authors suggested that insect species that jump from plants have longer legs because it reduces the amount of energy lost to bending the leaf, whereas species that jump from a stiffer substrate can have shorter-legs  <cit> . hence, in species living on plants, natural selection would have favored long hind legs because these allow short preparation times when an emergency jump is necessary  <cit> . the existence of moderate differences in morphology between ground-dwelling and plant-perching species was confirmed when restricting our analyses to the gomphocerinae subset. despite of members of the subfamily gomphocerinae exhibit low variability in morphology , gomphocerine species perching on plants tend to present a less rotund morphology -larger and thinner legs- in comparison with gomphocerine species that prefer to stay on the ground, which show squat bodies and short limbs. our results suggest that there are two possible ways to achieve superior jumping capabilities: to evolve longer limbs or to evolve more muscular limbs   <cit> . this finding is in agreement with that reported by  <cit>  in a study with anole species, which also seem to face trade-offs that prevent them from simultaneously optimizing different skills of jumping ability .

head shape differed significantly between ground- and plant-species across taxa. plant-perching species show a sharper head than ground-species, which may be favored by natural selection as this head shape facilitates camouflage against potential predators by making it difficult to see the mimic against the surroundings   <cit> . however, this difference between both categories become non-significant within the gomphocerinae, which implies that differences in head shape between ground- and plant-species have to do with its different phylogenetic history per se rather than with the possible existence of a substrate type effect. in band-winged grasshoppers , the orientation of the face is usually nearly vertical  whereas species of the subfamily gomphocerinae  show a sharper profile, that is, a more conical head.

lastly, we also found a marginally significant association between the relative length of antennae and the level of ecological specialization. larger antennae can bear a higher number of chemoreceptors, which would be favorable for grasshoppers in the search for shelter or food  <cit> . hence, in those species that can thrive only in a limited range of habitats or have a limited diet , the development of sensory organs may be favored, whereas in species with a broader ecological niche breadth  selection for larger antennae may be weaker. thus, the length of antennae in short-horned grasshoppers could be employed as a proxy for the degree of ecological specialization in terms of habitat requirements of a given species.

CONCLUSIONS
short-horned grasshoppers exploit a variety of habitats, but lack the extreme specializations  observed in other taxa . accordingly, at a first glance, it seems that acridid grasshoppers exhibit a conservative and “all-purpose” morphology allowing them to perform equally well under different environments, which is contrary to one of the premises that are frequently used to catalogue a radiation as adaptive  <cit> . however, in this study we provide evidence that natural selection could lead to a convergent body plan in very distant clades in this recent radiation  <cit> . specifically, we found substrate type-related macroevolutionary variation in locomotory attributes and head morphology. the observed pattern was consistent with an evolutionary scenario with two adaptive peaks  related to life-form . thus, these findings suggest that, although this radiation does not meet the conditions to be classified as adaptive sensu stricto , it provides evidence that natural selection can act on a very small scale, and therefore it is not always detectable. so, even in a priori morphostatic radiations, adaptive processes can lead to subtle phenotypic variation. hence, our results support the notion that ecological factors play a key role in evolutionary processes by acting as selective mechanisms and by imposing constraints that shape morphological traits  <cit> . in sum, this study highlights that natural selection, and not genetic drift, constitutes the main factor driving the disparification process in this recent radiation despite of the lack of apparent phenotypic and ecological variability. this calls into the question the use of term “non-adaptive” as synonymous with “morphostatic” since the total absence of an adaptive component seems to be unlikely in any radiation.
