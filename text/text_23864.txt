BACKGROUND
neurons and astrocytes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus continue to be replaced throughout adult life in several species including humans  <cit> . given the therapeutic implications of promoting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus  <cit> , it is becoming increasingly important to identify the mechanisms involved in the early stages of adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation. receptors amendable to small molecule therapeutic targeting are of particular interest.

several lines of evidence raise the possibility that neurotrophins and their receptors might be capable of regulating dentate progenitor proliferation and/or differentiation. mature neurotrophins interact with two types of receptors: the trk tyrosine kinase receptors  and the p <dig> neurotrophin receptor   <cit> . p75ntr receptors promote neuronal death or survival depending on the cellular context and the actions of a complex array of intracellular adaptors  <cit> . in in vitro studies, p75ntr-linked signaling has also been found to regulate cell cycle progression and/or cellular maturation of the following cell types: human oral keratinocyte stem/progenitor cells  <cit> ; myoblasts  <cit> , pc <dig> cells  <cit> ; neuroblasts  <cit> , embryonic striatal progenitors  <cit> ; embryonic forebrain neurospheres  <cit> ; and subventricular zone cells  <cit> . mouse embryonic stem cells have been shown to express p75ntr and ngf-induced proliferation of these cells can be inhibited by a p75ntr blocking antibody  <cit> .

the question of whether p75ntr regulates proliferation or maturation of neural progenitors in vivo has been examined in the context of the subventricular zone , olfactory bulb and subgranular zone  of the dentate gyrus. giuliani et al  <cit>  demonstrated that p75ntr is expressed by a large population of dividing cells in the adult svz while trka and trkb expression was not detected. in ncam-/- mice, gascon et al.  <cit>  found increased p75ntr expression in the rostral migratory stream-olfactory bulb that was associated with early maturation and increased levels of death in the progenitor population. young et al.  <cit>  also found that p75ntr is expressed by svz cells in adult mice. in p75ntr-/- mice, they observed a 25-45% reduction in the number of svz psa-ncam-positive neuroblasts and a significant reduction in olfactory bulb weight. in neurospheres derived from these mice, in which expression of trka or trkb receptors was not detected, bdnf- and ngf-induced neurogenesis was found to be mediated entirely by p75ntr, further pointing to a role for p75ntr in regulating svz neurogenesis. a recent study assessed dentate gyrus neurogenesis in p75ntr-/- mice and found a 50% decrease in the number of brdu-positive cells using a  <dig> h brdu labeling protocol followed by cell counts at the two week time point  <cit> . at the six-week time point, there was no difference in wildtype versus mutant mice in the number of cells co-labeled by brdu and the neuronal marker neun. these observations raised the possibility that p75ntr might be required for dentate progenitor proliferation. however, the key questions of whether p75ntr is expressed by proliferating progenitors, whether p75ntr is expressed by non-neuronal cells and whether genesis of non-neuronal cells is altered in p75ntr mutant mice remain to be addressed.

in the present study we tested the hypothesis that p75ntr is expressed by adult dentate gyrus progenitor cells expressing neuronal and/or glial markers and is required for their proliferation and differentiation into neurons, glia and/or other cells types.

RESULTS
p75ntr is present in sgz progenitor cells
the presence of p75ntr in proliferating cells within the sgz was assessed by quantitating cells co-expressing brdu and p75ntr. animals underwent a single injection of brdu  followed by sacrifice  <dig> h later  <cit> . sgz progenitors demonstrate a cell cycle of ~14- <dig> hours  <cit>  and become post-mitotic  <dig> days after their initial division  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  confocal imaging identified sgz cells expressing both p75ntr and brdu consistent with p75ntr expression in proliferating progenitor cells. within these cells, p75ntr signal was evident in both a nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution . previous studies applying p75ntr antibodies for assessment of svz progenitors and striatal neurons found either membrane-associated staining or diffuse intracellular staining  <cit> .

in a second series of studies, animals received a single administration of brdu at the same dose and were harvested at  <dig> h and 2d time points. at the first time point, numbers of brdu-positive cells were relatively low and increased by approximately  <dig> -fold by 2d . at the first time point essentially all of the brdu-positive cells expressed p75ntr while at 2d, some 80% expressed p75ntr.

dentate gyrus newborn cells express p75ntr and neuronal or astrocytic markers
p75ntr  mice were used to evaluate whether newborn cells in the adult dentate gyrus expressing p75ntr also express neuronal or astrocytic markers. mice were injected daily for  <dig> days with brdu , and the proportions of cells co-expressing brdu and p75ntr that also expressed neun or gfap were measured . following the 6d brdu course, most of the dentate gyrus brdu-positive cells were found to express p75ntr. a large proportion of brdu/p75ntr-co-expressing cells also labeled with the neun neuronal marker . a smaller proportion of brdu/p75ntr-co-expressing cells were labeled with the gfap astrocytic marker . as shown in the inset in figure 3c, immunostaining with p75ntr antibody of sections derived from p75ntr -/- mice showed no significant signal and thus verified the specificity of the antibody. these findings suggest that a relatively large proportion of newborn p75ntr-positive cells differentiate into neurons with a smaller proportion becoming astrocytes.

proliferation of dentate gyrus progenitor cells in p75ntr  and  mice
to determine whether p75ntr plays in role in dentate gyrus progenitor proliferation and/or differentiation, p75ntr  and  mice underwent the 6d brdu injection protocol and the above proliferation and differentiation markers were assessed at the  <dig> day time point. morphological assessment revealed a decreased number of brdu-positive cells in p75ntr  mice . in  mice, brdu-positive cells were more diffusely distributed compared to the aggregates of brdu-positive cells that are typically seen in p75ntr  and other wildtype mice  <cit>  . quantitative stereological analyses  demonstrated that in p75ntr  mice the number of brdu-positive cells was decreased by 59%  relative to control mice . the lack of any overlap between the values obtained from the   and   was consistent with a fully penetrant effect of the mutant genotype and thus further pointed to the significance of the effect of the  genotype on progenitor proliferation. this decrease in the number of brdu-positive cells in p75ntr  mice was not associated with a decrease in dentate gyrus volume , thus consistent with a deceased in progenitor number and density per volume.

dentate gyrus progenitor differentiation in p75ntr  and  mice
to determine whether the decrease in progenitor proliferation in p75ntr  dentate gyrus was associated with altered differentiation of progenitors into neurons or glia, sections from the above mice were assessed for co-labeling of brdu-positive cells with neun and gfap. confocal microscopic images of cells triple-labeled for brdu, neun and gfap confirmed the expected presence of newborn cells expressing neun or gfap . in p75ntr  mice, stereological estimates   of brdu-positive cells revealed a 35% decrease in the number cells co-expressing neun, a 60% decrease in the number cells co-expressing gfap and a 64% decrease in the number of cells expressing neither marker, with the decrease reaching statistical significance for all three categories. assessment of the proportions of brdu-positive cells within these three marker categories  demonstrated that the proportion of brdu-positive cells co-labeling with neun increased from 66% in p75ntr  mice to 81% in  mice. in contrast, the proportions of brdu-positive cells co-labeling with gfap or neither marker decreased in p75ntr  mice. thus, in p75ntr  mice, dentate gyrus cellular proliferation as indicated by brdu labeling is considerably decreased  and this decrease includes significantly reduced numbers of cells with neuronal, glial and neither markers. within this context there is a concomitant modest increase in the proportion of brdu-positive cells expressing neun.

discussion
this study demonstrates three key findings relevant to the identification of receptors regulating neurogenesis: first, newborn cells in the adult dentate gyrus, labeling with either neuronal or glial markers, express p75ntr during early stages of proliferation; second, the number of sgz newborn cells is significantly reduced in p75ntr  mice; and third, the numbers of cells in all three categories, those expressing neuronal, glial or neither marker, are significantly reduced in p75ntr  mice.

the 59% decrease in the number of newborn sgz cells in p75ntr  mice found here is similar to the findings of catts et al. <cit> , using a  <dig> hour brdu oral labeling regime and a 2-week chase period  <cit> , thereby further supporting a role of p75ntr in dentate progenitor proliferation. the prior study also found a 50-60% reduction in the number of brdu- neun-positive cells at the 2-week time point while the present study detected a 35% decrease in the number of brdu- neun-positive cells at the  <dig> day time point following the 6-day brdu labeling protocol. hence, our study further supports a role for p75ntr in neurogenesis. this effect could be caused by p75ntr promoting survival and/or differentiation of cells undergoing neuronal differentiation. in contrast to the catts et al study, we found no decrease in dentate gyrus volume. a lack of effect on dentate volume has also been noted in other studies in which sgz progenitor proliferation and/or neurogenesis is altered  <cit> . in addition to the difference in time points examined, the prior study applied an oral brdu dose of  <dig> mg/kg/day compared to the present ip dose of  <dig> mg/kg/day. while a number of factors are likely to contribute to the difference in findings in terms of dentate volume loss between the studies, it is of interest to note that high brdu concentrations have been associated with neuronal death  <cit> .

in addition to the effect of p75ntr on neuron formation, a related critical question is its role in the genesis of non-neuronal cells. in the present study, the gfap glial maker was applied and revealed that in p75ntr mice, there were 60% and 64% decreases in the total number of newborn cell labeled with gfap or neither marker, respectively. thus, in p75ntr mice the proportion of newborn cells expressing the neun marker is increased while the proportion without this marker is decreased. these studies introduce the important concept that while p75ntr appears to contribute to neurogenesis, it might make an even greater contribution to formation of various populations of non-neuronal cells. thus p75ntr cannot be linked specifically to neurogenesis, but instead appears to play a broader role in dentate cell genesis.

the identification of a role for p75ntr in dentate gyrus progenitor cell production is consistent with the emerging picture of p75ntr regulating cell cycle mechanisms as well as regulating the proliferation and/or differentiation of progenitors or embryonic stem cells in cell culture models and in the svz in vivo  <cit> . these findings are also consistent with other studies in p75ntr  mice in which a greater number of sympathetic neurons are present in early development while at later stages a decrease in the number of mature sympathetic neurons was found, suggesting that during development, p75ntr might first induce proliferation and later apoptosis  <cit> . similarly, during embryonic development, p75ntr appears to participate in the early stages of hippocampal cell proliferation, but at later stages induces death of neurons during maturation  <cit> ; and finally at the adult stage is expressed at low levels  <cit> .

while alterations of intrinsic signaling mechanisms in p75ntr  progenitors are likely to account for the decrease in neurogenesis observed here, it is also possible that factors extrinsic to progenitor cells contribute. for example, lesions in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampal ca <dig> and ca <dig> subregions or dentate gyrus induce an increase in dentate neurogenesis  <cit> . decreased cholinergic input into the dentate gyrus has also been associated with decreased neurogenesis  <cit> . interestingly, the p75ntr  mice used in the present study and other strains carrying the same mutation were shown to have increased dentate cholinergic innervation  <cit> . thus, the p75ntr  mice employed here would be expected to have increased, rather than decreased, neurogenesis if the extrinsic factor of cholinergic innervation played a predominant role.

studies demonstrating age-related impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis along with recent work showing that brain prongf levels increase with age  <cit>  raise the possibility that prongf might contribute to loss of newborn cells through its interaction with p75ntr. recently developed p75ntr small molecule ligands are able to promote pro-survival signaling and are also able to prevent prongf-induced death  <cit> . findings in the present study will encourage studies to establish whether p75ntr small molecule ligands can modulate dentate gyrus cell production.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that p75ntr receptor plays a fundamental role in the generation of dentate newborn cells in the adult brain. of particular interest are the novel findings that p75ntr is expressed by brdu-positive cells and that it is also expressed by newborn cells during the time periods in which they express neuronal or glial markers. an additional novel finding is that numbers of newborn neurons, as well as non-neurons, are decreased in p75ntr mice pointing to a role for this receptor in the formation of neurons as well as non-neurons. these results provide a basis for examining the effects of recently developed p75ntr small molecule ligands in dentate cell formation.
