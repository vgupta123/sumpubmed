BACKGROUND
oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases are a group of flavoenzymes, belonging to oxido-reductases, that are able to reduce nitro compounds depending on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide availability h)  <cit> . they catalyze the sequential reduction of nitro groups through the addition of electron pairs from nadh to produce nitroso -, hydroxylamino- and eventually amino-compounds  <cit> .

nitroreductases have been isolated from a large number of bacterial species . in fact, they are considered for biodegradation of nitroaromatic pollutants in particular explosives such as  <dig>   <dig>  6-trinitrotoluene   <cit> . moreover, in anti-cancer strategy, nitroreductases are one of the most studied candidates for gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy  <cit> . due to these potential applications, nitroreductases have been well studied in enteric bacteria, except for enterococcus faecalis, a gram positive opportunistic pathogen present in the intestine of a variety of mammals. for this species, nitroreductase activity has never been proven and no nitroreductase enzyme has as yet been characterised. nitroreductase activity in e. faecalis can be hypothesised from the observation that e. faecalis strains are usually sensitive to nitrofurans, antibiotics that are often used in case of urinary tract infections and which have retained value due to the expansion of resistance to ß-lactams  <cit> . since the antimicrobial effect of this class of molecules is mostly mediated by reduced products generated through bacterial nitroreductase activity, the presence of nitroreductases in e. faecalis can be expected. while it appears useful to identify them for potential improvements of such applications.

a phylogenetic analysis allows classification of oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases into two groups. group a nitroreductases are usually nadph-dependent whereas group b nitroreductases can use both nadh and nadph as electron donors  <cit> . despite this classification, nitroreductases physiological substrates and roles remain unclear. in e. coli, nfsa expression is depending on oxidative stress response mediated by soxrs  <cit> . this suggests an involvement in cell response to toxic compounds exposure. furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that azoreductases are able to reduce a larger set of compounds, including quinones and nitroaromatics, than their first known substrates: azo-compounds  <cit> . this evidence suggests connections in between these reductases families.

in e. faecalis, only one azoreductase  has been well characterised  <cit> . azoreductases can also be classified on the basis of their cofactor use  and prosthetic group dependence, covalent linkage of flavin mononucleotide  in particular  <cit> . type one and two are fmn-dependent azoreductases preferentially using nadh or nadph, respectively. type  <dig> enzymes are fmn independent azoreductases. the reduction of azo bonds occurs through a similar mechanism as the one for nitro reduction, a bi-bi ping pong mechanism enabling a two-electron transfer  <cit> . therefore, there is an interest in similarities and differences between these enzymes, especially regarding their substrate specificities.

in this study, we aimed to confirm nitroreductase activity in e. faecalis strains and to identify the enzymes possibly involved. based on genome annotations of e. faecalis v <dig> and protein sequence motif prediction, we selected four putative nitroreductases: ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig>  we cloned and purified these enzymes and tested their nitroreductase activity, fmn-dependence and cofactor preference. taking into account that the reduction of nitro compounds by azoreductases has been previously demonstrated, we tested the nitroreductase activity of azoa but also the azoreductase activity of the putative e. faecalis nitroreductases identified here.

bacterial nitroreductase activity testing
eight e. faecalis strains and an e. coli strain as control, all part of biomérieux strains collection were tested for their nitroreductase activity. for each strain, 100 μl of a  <dig> mcfarland suspension was inoculated into 100 μl of trypcase soy broth  containing 150 μm of 7-nitrocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid   <cit>  and incubated at 35 °c with shaking for 24 h. the bacterial reduction of this nitro substrate generates a fluorescent product . kinetic of nitroreduction was followed on an infinite® m <dig> microplate reader .

in silico search of nitroreductases in the e. faecalis v <dig> genome sequence
the protein blast search was carried out on e. faecalis v <dig> published transcribed genome using two reference sequences: nfsa  and nfsb , which are the two major nitroreductases in e. coli mg <dig>  as e. coli azoreductase azor displays nitroreductase activity  <cit> , a similar blast protein search was also performed using azor as the reference protein .

phylogenetic data analyses

for each gene, primer couples are reported. nucleotides identical to the gene sequence are in capital letters and nucleotide motifs required for cloning containing restriction sites bamhi or sali are in lowercase




the purified fragments and the expression vector pqe <dig> were digested by restriction enzymes bamhi and sali prior to ligation. the ligation was carried out using t <dig> dna ligase  under standard conditions.

all the constructed plasmids were verified by sequencing  to confirm the insertion and the absence of mutations in the sequences cloned.


e. coli strain xl1blue was used as a host strain to facilitate overproduction of the different proteins. the recombinant vectors were transformed into xl1blue cells by electroporation. the recombinant transformants were selected by their ampicillin resistance .

purification of enzymes
his-tagged recombinant enzymes were purified according to two different processes previously described by mercier et al.  <cit> . the native method allowed to recover enzymes including bound cofactors. a denaturation/renaturation protocol allowed the isolation of enzymes without cofactors. excess  cofactors and imidazole used in the elution step of purification process were eliminated by dialysis.

whole cells extracts and overexpressed  recombinant proteins were analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  according to the method of laemmli  <cit> .

enzymatic assays
enzymatic activities were assayed with 10 mg. l− <dig> of purified proteins and 100 μm of substrate. methyl red and 7ncca are used as substrate for azo and nitro activities. reaction is followed in 50 mm sodium phosphate ph  <dig> buffer added with  <dig>  mm nad h, in a 96-well microplate .

the kinetic analyses were performed using purified proteins incubated at 35 °c while continuously measuring fluorescence development using an infinite® m <dig> microplate reader. absorbance at both excitation and emission wavelengths were quantified in order to evaluate potential quenching effects.

nitroreductase activity was evaluated by fluorescence increase at 365/440 nm , corresponding to emergence of the fluorescent products of 7ncca nitroreduction. azoreductase activity was evaluated using methyl red as substrate. reduction of this compound was detected by absorbance at 435 nm and by fluorescence at 250/395 nm , parameters used to detect anthranilic acid. all experiments were independently reproduced three to five times. all the fluorescence results were expressed in relative units. to simplify the graph, one experiment in each case has been chosen to draw the curves but all our experiments have shown very good reproducibility.

RESULTS
nitroreductase activity of e. faecalis strains
in the combined presence of bacteria and the nitroreductase substrate 7ncca, an increase of fluorescence was observed . all strains showed equivalent growth during this incubation . all e. faecalis strains showed activity towards this substrate, with limited variation between strains and equivalent to the e. coli strain tested as positive control, suggesting a consistent presence of this activity among e. faecalis strains.fig.  <dig> nitroreductase activity of e. faecalis strains. kinetics of reduction of 7ncca by  <dig> different e. faecalis strains  and one e. coli strain  followed as variation of fluorescence intensity at 365/440 nm in relative fluorescence unit  over 24 h. e. coli strain is used as positive control for nitroreductase activity




in silico search of nitroreductases in the e. faecalis v <dig> genome
using the nfsa sequence, one putative nadph-dependent oxidoreductase homologue was found in e. faecalis v <dig> genome: ef <dig>  showing 56% amino acid sequence similarity. using the nfsb sequence, two more putative nitroreductases were identified: ef <dig>  and ef <dig>  with  <dig> and 37% sequence similarity, respectively. these three proteins were already annotated as possible nitroreductases in the uniprot database. in this database, another protein was identified as a putative nitroreductase: ef <dig> .

the blast search on v <dig> proteins using azor as reference sequence was also performed. apart from azoa  which shares 58% similarity to azor, no additional putative azoreductase was found.

phylogenetics of e. faecalis azoreductases and putative nitroreductases
we aligned the sequences of azoa and the new putative nitroreductases here identified with previously characterised azo and nitro reductases proteins from different bacterial species and a phylogenetic tree was constructed .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of azoreductase and nitroreductase proteins. phylogenic tree was generated using a multiple alignment of proteins  which have experimentally shown azoreductase and/or nitroreductase activity. nitroreductases of e. faecalis, studied here, are indicated in bold. a specific colour is attributed to each reductases family. for azoreductases, families type  <dig> to  <dig> are indicated. in dark blue, type  <dig> gathers fmn-dependent nadh azoreductases. in orange, type  <dig> regroups fmn-dependent nadph azoreductases. in turquoise, type  <dig> are fmn-independent azoreductases. for nitroreductases, in red, group a represents oxygen-insensitive nadph dependent nitroreductase. in green, group b gathers oxygen-insensitive nadh nitroreductase. the nomenclature is the following: first the protein name and then the species. the references of the protein sequences aligned are the following: azo1_s. aureus:aat <dig> ; azoa_e. faecalis:aar <dig> ; azoa_p. kullae:aao <dig> ; azob_x. azovorans:aam <dig> ; azob_p. kullae:add <dig> ; azor_r. sphaeroides:aba <dig> .; azor_e. coli:aac <dig> .; azor_g. stearothermophilus:aad <dig> .; azor1_p. putida:aan <dig> .; azor1_p. aeruginosa:aag <dig> ; azor1_b. subtilis:cab <dig> .; azor2_p. aeruginosa:aag <dig> ; azor2_b. subtilis:cab <dig> .; azor3_p. aeruginosa:aag <dig> .; azr_b. subtilis:cab <dig> .; ef0404_e. faecalis:aao <dig> .; ef0648_e. faecalis:aao <dig> .; ef0655_e. faecalis:aao <dig> ; ef1181_e. faecalis:aao <dig> ; frase1_v. fisheri:baa <dig> .; frp_v. harveyi:aaa <dig> .; nfra_s. aureus:abd <dig> .; nfra1_b. subtilis:cab <dig> .; nfsa_k. pneumoniae:abr <dig> .; nfsa_e. coli:aac <dig> .; nfsb_p. aeruginosa:aag <dig> .; nfsb_e. coli:aac <dig> .; nfsb_k. pneumoniae:abr <dig> .; ntra_s. aureus:abd <dig> .; pnba_l. plantarum:ccc <dig> .; pnra_p. putida:aam <dig> .; pnrb_p. putida:aam <dig> .; snra_s. typhimurium:aad <dig> .; ycnd_b. subtilis:baa <dig> .; ydgi_b. cereus:aap <dig> .; ydgi_b. subtilis:baa <dig> .; yfko_b. cereus:aap <dig> .; yfko_b. licheniformis:ewh <dig> .; ytjd_l. lactis:aak <dig> .; nqo1_h. sapiens:aab <dig> 




ef <dig> harbours a sequence close to that of nadph-dependent nitroreductase, also indicated as group a . ef <dig> inserts into the group of nadh-dependent nitroreductases . this group gathers proteins which can use both nadh and nadph as cofactors for nitroreduction. ef <dig> classifies closely to ef <dig> among the nitroreductases of group b. ef <dig> appears to be distant from nitroreductases of group a and group b, but is similar, at 72%, to ytjd from lactococcus lactis  <cit> . these two enzymes regroup into the nitroreductase 4-sub family based on amino acids from conservative domains .

thus, the four putative nitroreductases identified in e. faecalis strain v <dig> regroup into three different nitroreductase families, with the separation being based on their sequence similarities.

finally, azoa, characterised as an azoreductase in e. faecalis, is aligned with group  <dig>  corresponding to characterised azoreductases, in which some have already been shown to display nitroreductase activity   <cit> .

cloning, overproduction and purification of azoa, ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig> proteins
all the previously identified genes encoding proteins azoa, ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig> were successfully cloned in pqe <dig>  which allows for an n-terminal histidine tag  to be inserted. by sequencing, the inserted sequences were verified: all constructs corresponded to the expected sequences without any mutation present. all the constructs enabled the overproduction and purification of the expected recombinant proteins using his-tag affinity chromatography. on denaturing sds-page, a unique band was observed for each recombinant protein, approximatively 22 kda for ef <dig>  25 kda for azoa, ef <dig>  ef <dig> and 30 kda for ef <dig>  these results match the expected molecular weight based on gene sequences and the his-tag motif addition.

as previously described  <cit> , the purified and native recombinant proteins were all yellow, suggesting the presence of protein bound fmn  <cit> . liquid chromatography – electrospray ionisation – mass spectrometry  confirmed fmn presence for the enzymes purified using native conditions. when using the denaturation/renaturation protocol  <cit> , which leads to cofactor detachment, the recombinant proteins fractions were colourless and the removal of almost all fmn was demonstrated by lc-esi-ms analysis. on average, fmn peak intensity was reduced by at least 90% using this purification protocol .

nitroreductase activity of e. faecalis proteins and cofactor preference
all of the five recombinant proteins purified under native conditions were tested with 7ncca as nitro substrate. they were all able to reduce this substrate indicating their nitroreductase activity, as the azoreductase azoa .fig.  <dig> nitroreductase activity of azoa, ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef1181: native  and without prosthetic group enzymes . nitroreductase activity is evaluated by following fluorescence intensity at 365/440 nm during 900 min in presence of 100 μmol.l− <dig> 7ncca, 500 μmol.l− <dig> nadph and 10 mg.l− <dig> of indicated enzyme. a the proteins used were purified with their prosthetic group in their native form. no fmn was added for the reaction. b the proteins used were purified without their prosthetic group, that is purified using the denaturing/renaturing protocol. the reduction is followed without addition of fmn  and with 5 μmol.l− <dig> of fmn 




for the enzymes without prosthetic group obtained through the denaturation/renaturation protocol, no 7ncca reduction was observed. addition of fmn restored the reduction activity for all five recombinant enzymes as shown by the increase of fluorescence . clearly, no fluorescence was observed in the absence of enzyme. consequently, all the newly identified proteins have now confirmed nitroreductase activity, and so has azoa, in a fmn-dependent manner.

nitroreductases are separated regarding their preference toward nadh or nadph, a cofactor required for electronic exchange to happen  <cit> . for these five recombinant proteins, we determined which cofactor enabled better 7ncca reduction, leading to cofactor preference.

ef <dig> and ef <dig> reduced the substrate equally well in the presence of either nadh or nadph , but emergence of fluorescence was delayed compared to the other proteins. however, it is worth noting that fluorescence was detected earlier when native ef <dig> was used for nitroreduction , which indicates that purifying this enzyme without prosthetic group might affect its resultant conformation. for ef <dig>  similar results were obtained with both purification protocols. the fluorescence delay might be due to protein conformation issues, and indicates a weaker activity compared to ef <dig> fig.  <dig> nitroreductase activity of azoa, ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig> and their cofactor preferences. a-b the proteins used were purified without their prosthetic group, that is purified using the denaturing/renaturing protocol. nitroreductase activity is evaluated by following fluorescence intensity at 365/440 nm during 900 min in presence of 100 μmol.l− <dig> 7ncca and 10 mg.l− <dig> of indicated enzyme. to determine each enzyme preference toward cofactors, 7ncca reduction is followed in presence of 500 μmol.l− <dig> nadph  or nadh . fmn is added at 5 μmol.l− <dig>  the control wells contained the reaction buffer  h) without enzyme




with ef <dig>  an increase of fluorescence was observed in the presence of nadh and nadph, suggesting that this enzyme can use both cofactors . however, fluorescence slopes indicated a preference towards nadph.

interestingly, azoa, the azoreductase which is able to reduce the nitro substrate, showed very similar results when compared to ef <dig> for 7ncca reduction. azoa was able to use both nadh and nadph as cofactor, with an increased activity with the latter .

ef <dig> was able to reduce the 7ncca using nadph only . this is evidence for ef <dig> being a strictly nadph-dependent nitroreductase. ef <dig> nitroreduction was higher for the enzyme purified using denaturation/renaturation protocol with fmn addition than for the native form . this suggests that ef <dig> purified in its native form might lack of fmn to exhibit full activity.

we showed that all five purified proteins share nitroreductase activity while having different cofactor specificities.

azoreductase activity of e. faecalis proteins and cofactors preference
azoa is able to reduce methyl red as demonstrated by monitoring the formation of the fluorescent end-product anthranilic acid. among the nitroreductases identified in this work, ef <dig> was also able to reduce this azo substrate . for the three others nitroreductases ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig>  no azoreductase activity was detected with methyl red, as no substrate reduction was observed whatever cofactor was used .fig.  <dig> azoreductase activity of azoa and ef <dig> and their cofactor preferences. the proteins used were purified without their prosthetic group, that is purified using the denaturation/renaturation protocol. for the enzymes presenting azoreductase activity, methyl red reduction is monitored by fluorescence intensity at 250/395 nm during 60 min in presence 10 mg.l− <dig> of indicated enzyme. a to test the importance of fmn for these enzymes, methyl red  reduction is followed without addition of fmn  and with 5 μmol.l− <dig> of fmn . nadph is added at 500 μmol.l− <dig>  b methyl red  reduction is followed in presence of 500 μmol.l− <dig>  nadph  or nadh  to evaluate cofactors preference. fmn is added at 5 μmol.l− <dig>  the control wells contained the reaction buffer  h) without enzyme




without fmn addition, ef <dig> purified without prosthetic group was unable to reduce the methyl red, indicating its fmn-dependence for azoreductase activity. in case of azoa, without fmn addition, a late and slight fluorescence increase was observed. this result might be due to residual bound or unbound fmn within the protein solution.

for both ef <dig> and azoa, cofactor preference was studied . both proteins showed increased azoreduction in the presence of nadh. for ef <dig>  azoreduction of methyl red in presence of nadph is low. even if nadph presence can lead to methyl red reduction by ef <dig> and azor, fluorescence pattern seems to indicate that nadh is the natural cofactor for this activity.

discussion
the major aim of this work was to detect and confirm e. faecalis nitroreductase activity and to further characterise the enzymes which are responsible for this activity. first, overall nitroreductase activity was demonstrated for a panel of e. faecalis strains. secondly, the four putative nitroreductases identified using blast research on e. faecalis v <dig> genome and the azoreductase azoa were cloned, expressed and purified. when purified without fmn, the enzymes were unable to reduce the substrates tested, confirming their fmn-dependence.

ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig> are the first experimentally confirmed nitroreductases in e. faecalis and each enzyme presented specific cofactor dependence . as nitroreductases are distinguished by their preference towards nadh or nadph  <cit> , there was an interest to define the phylogeny of the newly discovered enzymes. ef <dig> was only able to reduce the nitro substrate using nadph as cofactor which correlates with its position in nadph-dependent nitroreductases group, also known as group a. thus, ef <dig> might be the e. faecalis equivalent of nfsa in e. coli. ef <dig> is part of the nitroreductases group b which can use both nadh and nadph as cofactors as shown by our experiments. hence, ef <dig> might be the equivalent in e. faecalis of nfsb in e. coli.table  <dig> summary of purified proteins activities

for each enzyme, it is reported whether it presents nitroreductase and/or azoreductase activity: +: activity has been established by reduction of tested compound; −: no activity was observed; na: not applicable

when activity was established, fmn-dependence and cofactor dependence/preference are indicated




while ef <dig> and ef <dig> results correlated well to phylogenetic classification, ef <dig> results were more intriguing. indeed, ef <dig> was closely related to ef <dig> among nitroreductases of group b, but ef <dig> reduced both the azo and nitro substrates tested. of both enzymes, only ef <dig> reduced methyl red. moreover, for 7ncca reduction, ef <dig> demonstrated a preference for nadph, which is not the case for ef <dig> . therefore, regarding activity results, ef <dig> didn’t appear close to ef <dig>  to our knowledge, no nitroreductases from group a have been shown to be able to reduce azo compounds directly. e. coli nitroreductases, nfsa and nfsb, can reduce azo compounds but only indirectly, in a lawsone  dependent manner  <cit> . it is nfsa and nfsb ability to reduce lawsone into hydroquinone that leads to further chemical reduction of the azo compound. here, ef <dig> reduced methyl red directly with no addition of redox mediators, confirming azoreductase activity of this enzyme. consequently, for ef <dig>  the results obtained were much closer to those obtained with the azoreductase azoa, although their structure and similarities were quite distant.

interestingly, a single amino acid substitution in the active site of the azoreductases in e. coli, e. faecalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to modify substrate specificity, cofactor binding or activity . consequently, we can hypothesize that one or more amino acid changes in the ef <dig> active site might explain its ability to reduce methyl red whereas the other nitroreductases tested cannot. there are two established motifs defining amino acids for fmn binding and dimer interface in nitroreductase. ef <dig> is presenting four amino acids different from the consensus for fmn binding  and which appear to affect protein structure. both proteins presents more difference toward the consensus for dimer interface and none of these differences modify the protein structure elements. differences in binding fmn might then modify the panel of substrates.

azoreductases have already been described to actively modify nitro compounds. for example, azor in e. coli is able to reduce cb <dig>  <cit>  as well as the 7ncca used here  <cit> . in agreement with previous results, we demonstrate here that azoa from e. faecalis is capable of nitroreduction. the reduction of nitro compounds by azoa is probably based on the same mechanism as was shown for azor <dig> of p. aeruginosa with nitrofurazone  <cit> .

finally, ef <dig> appears to be distant from nitroreductases of groups a and b and shares 59% identity with ytjd from lactococcus lactis  <cit> . ef <dig> and ytjd are 63% and 58% homologous to the nitroreductase  <dig> family consensus sequence, respectively. ytjd was studied in detail since its activity is regulated by copper. genetically, no similarity was found between ef <dig> and ytjd and therefore no regulatory regions were identified in ef <dig>  moreover, ef <dig> was not shown to be affected by copper in transcriptomic studies  <cit> . however, an e. faecalis metabolic networks have shown highly conserved connections within the lactobacillales order when exposed to copper  <cit> . therefore ef <dig> and ytjd might be inherited from a common lactobacillales ancestor  <cit> . consequently, it might be of interest to test copper-mediated induction of ef <dig>  ef <dig> is a nitroreductase, which in cellulo role might differ from the one of ef <dig> and ef <dig>  in fact, this enzyme had the lowest and most delayed activity on the nitro substrate tested.

separation of enzymes based on their sequence homology tends to exclude the possibility of these enzymes to have different reductase activities. for example, it was recently shown that mdab, arsh and yief from p. aeruginosa can reduce different azo compounds while being part of distantly homologous oxido-reductases families with respect to protein sequence. interestingly, these proteins were also proven to reduce quinones and nitrofurazone  <cit> . consequently, biochemical assays are clearly necessary to corroborate the protein homologies.

previously, azoreductases were shown to better reduce quinones than azo compounds. because of this observation and the related reaction mechanism, it is already suggested that azoreductases and quinone reductases have a common physiological role and group into the same enzymatic families  <cit> . nitroreductases are also able to reduce quinones, sometimes with higher affinity than for nitro compounds  <cit> . according to the results we obtained with azoa and ef <dig>  we emphasize the abilities of azoreductases and nitroreductases to complement each other. considering, azoreductases, nitroreductase and quinone reductases as one group of enzymes could help to understand their role in the bacterial cellular mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
diverse e. faecalis enzymes belonging to different oxido-reductase families are able to reduce the same nitro compound. our work clearly demonstrate that the experimental proof of activity is necessary to identify the substrate specificity of each enzyme as homologies with other known reductases is not sufficient. the redundancy of reductase in e. faecalis may be an indication that such activities are important. it could also indicate that each of these enzymes may have a preferred domain of activity depending on the environment and/or on the availabilities of substrates and cofactors. both hypotheses should be taken into consideration to identify enzymes for processes or therapies that would depend on these kind of activities, such as for the bioremediation of azo dyes or the use of nitroaromatic drugs.
