BACKGROUND
malting is the first step in brewing or beer production of malt barley, and the properties of malting barley are generally evaluated on the basis of malting quality. high malting quality is characterized by high malt extract  and diastatic power , as well as high wort fermentation by yeast, i.e. complete degradation of starch and polysaccharide in malt
 <cit> . the major chemical compound in barley grains is starch, which consists of 30% amylose and 70% amylopectin
 <cit> .

starch is degraded by coordinative action of α-amylase, β-amylase, limit dextrinase  and α-glucosidase in the endosperm of the germinating grains
 <cit> . ld is the only enzyme of cleaving α-1- <dig> linkages in branched dextrins molecules
 <cit> . without the action of ld, the branched dextrins could not be fermented by yeast
 <cit> . hence, ld plays an important role in the brewing and distilling industries for producing fermentable sugar.

ld in barley grains exists in three different forms: insoluble bound, soluble inactive and active free, and only the active free form participates in starch mobilization
 <cit> . however, the free ld accounts for a small portion of total ld. the low activity of available ld in grains is due to its combination with endogenous inhibitors, limit dextrinase inhibitor 
 <cit> . ld and ldi interact with each other in a 1: <dig> molar ratio complex
 <cit> . the ld bound to ldi is thought to be a limiting factor for complete degradation of starch
 <cit> .

ldi is synthesized in the developing grains, and degraded gradually during the malting process
 <cit> . consequently, ld activity in malt is not only dependent on the amount of the enzyme itself in mature grains, and also is closely related to the amount and type of ldi. hvldi was identified to encode the ldi protein, and located at chromosome 6h
 <cit> . however, genetic variation and controlling of ldi synthesis and degradation in barley grains and malt is not totally understood. in view of a wider variation of ld activity in tibetan wild barley than in cultivated barley , it is imperative to determine the genetic variation of ldi content in tibetan wild barley, which has been recently proved to be a progenitor of cultivated barley and is rich in genetic diversity
 <cit> .

association analysis has been widely used to identify genes or loci of important traits, such as abiotic stress tolerance
 <cit> , agronomic traits
 <cit>  and also barley quality
 <cit> . however, there has been no report on the discovery of novel loci or elite alleles attributed to ldi activity using association analysis.

the objectives of this study were to  determine the genetic variation of ldi activity in tibetan wild barley;  identify the dart markers and snps of hvldi associated with ldi activity in tibetan wild barley.

methods
plant materials
a total of  <dig> tibetan wild barley accessions, kindly provided by professor sun of huazhong agricultural university, china, were used for ldi activity and association analysis. all accessions were planted in early november  <dig> and  <dig> in zijingang campus, zhejiang university . every genotype was cultivated in accordance with local agronomic practices with three replications. the  <dig> barley accessions were planted in a block with each accession consisting of three lines .

assay of ldi activity
grain samples were micro-malted in a phoenix system micro-malting apparatus  in the order of steeping, germination and drying. ld was partially purified from barley malt according to kristensen et al.
 <cit> . the fractions were applied to gel filtration chromatography after the ion exchange chromatography step, and partially purified ld was collected and used for the measurement of ldi activity.

ldi activity was determined according to macgregor et al.
 <cit>  with some modification. one ml of  <dig>  m sodium acetate  containing 10 mm  <dig> -phenanthroline was added to  <dig>  g barley powder, incubated at 4°c for 30 min. the extract was heated at 70°c for 40 min, centrifuged and the supernatant was collected. the protein content of the extracts was measured using bradford assay kits . twenty micrograms protein of ldi extract were mixed with 10 mu partially purified ld and the volume was made up to  <dig>  ml in  <dig>  m maleic acid containing  <dig> % na azide . the remaining ld was determined using the limit-dextrinase assay kit . the ldi activity was calculated as the reduced ld activity.

population structure and kinship analysis
totally,  <dig> dart markers, with minor allele frequency  higher than  <dig>  , were used for population structure analysis using structure software 
 <cit> , in which the number of clusters  was set from  <dig> to  <dig> and ten iterations were performed in an admixture model with  <dig>  burning period and  <dig>  mcmc . the dart markers used were derived from diversity arrays technology pty ltd, australia and distributed over the whole genome
 <cit> . the most probable number of clusters  was estimated according to the value of Δk. when Δk had the highest value, the value of k was the number of clusters
 <cit> . kinship was estimated using spagedi software
 <cit> . genetic distance and neighbor-joining tree were developed with ntsyspc .

variance component and heritability estimation
variance analysis was conducted using spss software. the used model was: y = mu + genotype + error . heritability was estimated according to h2 = vg/.

genome-wide association study  of ldi activity
genome-wide association study between ldi activity  and dart markers was conducted using tassel software , where q, k and q + k methods were applied
 <cit> . the structure matrix was included as covariate to correct population structure in q model: y = qν + xβ + e, where x is the dart marker matrix, q is the structure matrix, β and ν are coefficient vectors for dart marker vector and population structure vector, and e is the random error vector. in k model: y = xβ + zu + e. the q + k model can be written in a matrix form as: y = qν + xβ + zu + e, where x, β, q and ν are the same as those mentioned above, z is the kinship matrix, and u is a vector of random genetic effects u ~ n , where k is the kinship matrix. manhattan plots were displayed using r software .

genome-wide association study
the ldi activities of  <dig> accessions and  <dig> dart markers were used to perform genome-wide association study . two markers, bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> showed significance under q, k and q + k methods . when q method was used, the -log <dig> values for bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>  if only kinship was considered, the -log <dig> values for bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>  when a more restrict method, q + k method was applied, the -log <dig> values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in  <dig>  all of which reached the threshold of significance in association analysis: -log10 =  <dig> . for the mean ldi activity of the two years, the -log <dig> values for bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, if considered from only one population structure, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  if only kinship being considered, and  <dig>  and  <dig> , if both population structure and kinship being considered.

bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig>  located at  <dig>  cm on chromosome 6h and  <dig>  cm on 3h, showed significant associations with ldi activity, explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of phenotypic variation in  <dig> and  <dig> % and  <dig> % in  <dig> under q + k method. similarly, the two dart markers could explain  <dig> % and  <dig> % of phenotypic variation for the mean values of  <dig> and  <dig> 

association between hvldi and ldi activity and haplotype analysis
the variation of hvldi and its promoter region were further investigated because several evidences supported the existence of a major gene responsible for ldi activity
 <cit> . alignment of this region revealed  <dig> snps in the  <dig> accessions. thirty-one snps  were significantly associated with ldi activity, explaining  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation and –log <dig> value of each snp reaching a highly significant level .

according to polymorphism of  <dig> snps, the  <dig> barley accessions can be divided into  <dig> haplotypes: h1-h <dig>  h1-h <dig> showed high similarity of hvldi sequence, while h <dig> and h <dig> had the similar sequences . because the  <dig> significant snps in hvldi were complete disequilibrium  with each other, they could be regarded as one variant . hence, all accessions may be classified into two haplotypes, i.e. ha and hb. accordingly, the distribution of haplotypes within different subpopulations was investigated. q <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> were mainly constructed by haplotype  <dig>  and q <dig> by haplotype  <dig>  whereas q <dig> subpopulation showed specificity to other subpopulations for its balanced composition of ha and hb . interestingly, ha showed significantly lower ldi activity than hb in q <dig> subpopulation ,while there was no difference between them in other subpopulations.

discussion
in this study, we investigated the genetic variation of ldi activity and performed gwas analysis of hvldi, in order to identify the loci controlling ldi activity in tibetan wild barley. a wide variation in ldi activity was found in the  <dig> tibetan wild barley accessions, and some of which displayed a minus value. it should be noted that some dextrins released by the de-branching enzymes during germination could also be detected by the limit-dextrizyme method, and these dextrins may account for the overestimation of ld activity
 <cit> . thus, the detected ld activities in extraction solutions of some accessions were higher than those of added ld, resulting in minus values of ldi activity, which was calculated as the reduced ld activity. however, the minus values of ldi in this experiment only occurred in very few accessions, and were very small . therefore the accessions with minus values of ldi are quite low in ldi activity. actually, the impact of these dextrins produced during short-time extraction on the final ldi values could be negligible, as reported by
 <cit> .

two dart markers, i.e. bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> were found to be associated with ldi activities in tibetan wild barley. bpb- <dig>  a marker with highest gwa peak, is located near the locus of hvldi gene obtained from ipk database, where the whole barley genome sequences lay
 <cit> . this result confirms that hvldi is a major gene controlling ldi activity in barley grain. bpb- <dig> might be a potential locus contributing to ldi activity, and it has not been reported up to date. hence, it may be assumed that some minor effect genes affecting ldi activity may exist in tibetan wild barley, and need to be confirmed by qtl analysis in segregating population in future work.

a total of  <dig> snps of hvldi were significantly associated with ldi activity. it is also found that  <dig> of these snps are significantly associated with the malt extract in  <dig> cultivated genotypes in a previous study
 <cit> , in which association analysis between hvldi gene and ldi activity was not conducted. these results indicate that the ldi activity has a close relationship with malt extract, because the two traits are affected by the same  <dig> snps. indeed, it was previously reported that the hvldi antisense lines showed unpredicted pleiotropic effects on numerous enzyme activities, including α- and β-amylases, starch synthases, as well as starch granule types, all of which affect malt extract
 <cit> . in addition, the ld activity-associated snp in the previous study
 <cit>  was not detected in the tibetan wild population, suggesting that ld activity in malt may be independent on polymorphism of hvldi gene in tibetan population.

interestingly, ha and hb showed a significant difference of the ldi activity only in q <dig> subpopulation . q <dig> contains all kinds of haplotypes, while every other subpopulation mainly consists of one haplotype . in other word, q <dig> has a wider genetic diversity than every other subpopulation. it seems that these associated snps are false positive due to highly structured ld  in this chromosomal region, and similar phenomenon were also observed in association analysis of frost tolerance
 <cit> . it may be hypothesized that the variation of ldi activity in q <dig> may be caused by other variations, which share linkage disequilibrium with the detected snps, in or around this region
 <cit> . these variations should only belong to the accessions of ha in q <dig> subpopulation, and may exist in the upstream or promoter region of hvldi, or the regulated factors, which co-segregated with the detected snps. however, the assumption needs to be confirmed in the further work.

four snps  within a coding region generate the alteration of the amino acids sequence. but these two kinds of haplotypes showed no significant difference in ldi activity among all accessions. it can be concluded that the alteration of ldi activity may be not due to the change of amino acid composition.

CONCLUSIONS
this study confirmed the locus of ldi gene and detected a dart marker, bpb- <dig>  associated with ldi activity. the results provide useful information for identifying minor effect genes affecting ldi activity, and also prove that tibetan wild barley is an elite germplasm, which may act as an abundant gene pool for barley breeding. furthermore, the detected snps in this study should be helpful for better understanding the genetic control of ldi activity in barley grain.
