BACKGROUND
the perception of spatial orientation is influenced by visual information and the inertial forces that affect our body. for example, the perception of true vertical is biased by a tilted visual environment  <cit>  and by variations in the direction and/or magnitude of inertial forces acting on the body  <cit> . however, such perceptual biases present with altered sensory stimulation are not consistent across sexes.

witkin and colleagues reported sex differences in the perception of verticality using the rod-and-frame test . the rft requires the participant to orient a rod to the perceived vertical with and without a tilted surrounding frame. asch and witkin  <cit>  observed that "the perceived upright was always much closer to the visual than the postural vertical" . the perceptual bias was explained by a multisensory affordance of body tilt when the visual environment is tilted and was termed field dependence. interestingly, females are more field-dependent than males  <cit> . this influence of a visuo-spatial reference also affects females to a greater extent than males when assessed with direct vestibular stimulation using body tilt  <cit> . further, males perform differently than females for many other spatial tasks . in sum, males and females integrate afferent information related to spatial orientation differently  <cit> . however, these empirical observations benefit from very few explanations  <cit> .

reinking et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that instructing females to pay attention to internal sensory cues reduced their frame dependency in the rft. thus, cognitive processes significantly affect the perception of spatial orientation . more recently, we tested this cognitive explanation by asking males and females to identify their morphological horizon  in different body pitch orientations while either receiving no attentional instructions, instructions to pay attention to external sensory cues, or instructions to pay attention to internal sensory cues  <cit> . although females were affected by the instructions , sex differences were still significant in all conditions. these results provided some indirect support for an anatomical explanation .

in males, the utricle, saccule and superior semi-circular canals are significantly larger than in females  <cit> . as such, it is possible that anatomical differences in the vestibular apparatus between males and females are associated with sex differences in the perception of spatial orientation. if this is the case, then whole body rotation and/or altered body orientation should affect the pso differently in females and males.

the present study was designed to determine what type of body orientation manipulations mediate sex difference in the pso with the goal of identifying the type of receptor involved. perceived morphological horizon  was measured immediately after a whole body rotation  or while remaining stable in the same orientation , and in different body pitch orientations  . in accordance to previous literature, we anticipated that sex differences in pmh would be observed only when the body orientation is altered, stable, and with the least amount of blood redistribution .

RESULTS
45° orientation
the constant error in pmh analyses for the 45° body pitch conditions yielded a main effect for condition, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig> and an interaction between sex and condition, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig> . overall, participants presented a more footward bias in the stable- <dig>  the rotate-to- <dig>  and the post-rotate- <dig> conditions than in the upright condition. however, the breakdown of the sex by condition interaction revealed that this effect was only true for the females participants .

for the variable error analyses in pmh for the 45° orientation conditions, there was an effect of condition, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  which revealed that individuals were more variable immediately after a whole body rotation condition  than in the upright condition .

the trial by trial analysis was also significant, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  specifically, participants showed less footward bias in the first trial than in trials five to ten. likewise, there was a smaller footward bias in the second and the third trial than in trials eight to ten .

135° orientation
the constant error analysis for the 135° body pitch conditions yielded a main effect for condition, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig> but no effect or interaction involved sex. as depicted in figure  <dig>  the pmh was less biased in the upright condition than in all other conditions. as well, pmh was more biased in the rotate-to- <dig> condition than in the stable- <dig> and the post-rotate- <dig> conditions.

the variable error analysis for the 135° conditions revealed a main effect for condition as in the 45° orientation conditions, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  post hoc analysis of this effect revealed that participants more variable immediately after a whole body rotation condition  than in both the post-rotate- <dig> and upright conditions. as well, participants were less variable in the upright condition than in all 135° orientation conditions.

concerning the trial by trial analysis for the 135° conditions, a main effect for trial, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  as well as a condition by trial interaction, f  =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  were observed. specifically, there were greater footward biases in trials one and two than in trials eight and ten . as well, the post hoc analysis of the condition by trial interaction revealed a greater footward bias in the second and third trial than in the eighth trial of the stable- <dig> condition . finally, for the rotate-to- <dig> condition, we observed a greater footward bias in the first than in the fourth to the last trial, and also a greater footward bias in the second than in the sixth to the last trial .

correlational analyses
correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relative contribution of sex and three indices of blood volume on pmh. these indices were weight, height, and body mass index. body mass index is calculated by dividing the mass by the squared height of the participant. on average, females were  <dig>  m tall, weighed  <dig> kg, which yielded an average body mass index of  <dig>  kg/m <dig> and males were  <dig>  m tall, weighed  <dig> kg for an average body mass index of  <dig>  kg/m <dig>  in these analyses, we used weight, height, and body mass index to predict pmh bias from upright for two blocks of five  trials in each condition .

as would be expected from the inferential statistics, sex accounted for a significant amount of variance  in pmh in both blocks of trials of the stable- <dig> and the post-rotate- <dig> conditions . more specifically, females presented a greater footward bias than males. sex did not have a significant impact on perceptual judgements in any of the other conditions. moreover, sex differences at stable- <dig> and post-rotate- <dig> were independent of all blood volume indices.

interestingly, while our indices of blood volume failed to explain the obtained sex differences in the 45° conditions, body mass index and perceptual bias were significantly correlated in the second block of the rotate-to- <dig>  . note that it is in the rotate-to- <dig> condition that both males and females exhibited the largest footward bias. the relationship between body mass index and pmh indicates that people with lower body mass index present larger footward bias than people with higher body mass index. thus, while the shifts in blood volume were sufficient to create an important perceptual bias in the 135° conditions, they did not contribute significantly to the observed sex effects found in the 45° conditions. indeed, when body mass index, weight and height were included as covariates in the 45° conditions analyses of variance, they accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the between-participant variability, respectively, and they accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the between-participant variability, respectively, in the anova for the 135° conditions.

discussion
firstly, all experimental conditions in the 45° and 135° orientations significantly affected pmh as compared to the upright condition. the typical perceptual bias is footward and is analogous to the elevator illusion, which is explained by the variation of inertial forces acting on the otoliths  <cit>  although not fully explained by variation in eye position  <cit> .

as hypothesized, some effects were not different between males and females. for instance, the effect of rotate-to- <dig> changed as a function of trial, but that was similar for both sexes. this significant effect of body rotation on pmh for both males and females may have arisen from superior semi-circular canal stimulation . our results also support the idea that blood distribution in the body influences the perception of self-orientation  <cit> . indeed, the 135° conditions  induced more blood redistribution  than the 45° conditions and led to significant footward biases both for females and males. further, this blood redistribution also affected pmh variability as participants exhibited a smaller variable error in the upright condition than in both conditions immediately following a whole body rotation . on the other hand, it was particularly when participants were in the stable conditions of the 45° pitch position that sex differences were observed.

females demonstrated a footward bias in pmh when submitted to the 45° conditions  as compared to the upright condition. conversely, males were not affected by the sole modification of the direction of inertial forces. although we did not expect sex differences in pmh in the rotate-to- <dig> condition, the correlational analyses for the 45° conditions fully supported our predictions. indeed, sex explained a significant amount of variance of the pmh biases in the stable 45° body pitch conditions only . these findings indicate that variations in the direction of inertial forces are associated with sex differences in the pmh. certainly, further investigations in the perception of self-orientation are required to better explain the observed individual differences and further test our anatomical difference explanation  <cit> . at the very least, sex differences appear to be associated with the integration of information from gravireceptors or statoliths. further, it is important to note that our explanation assumes that the observed results arise from visual-vestibular interactions. indeed, it is important to note that identifying the perceived upright and horizon may not involve the vestibular system at all. although it is difficult to explain why only stable altered body orientations yielded significant differences between females and males without consideration for the vestibular input, this perspective must be mentioned. nevertheless, as compared to this purely visual explanation, our empirical observations yielded more support to our hypothesis considering visual-vestibular interactions.

in this study, we found significant sex differences in pmh. however, this does not mean that all males are immune to the perceptual effects induced by variation in the direction of inertial forces. indeed, collapsing across trials in the stable- <dig> condition revealed greater between-subject variability for males than for females  >  <dig>  p < .05). thus, stating that the perception of self-orientation – under visually deprived environment and altered vestibular stimulation  – is less biased for males than for females is misleading. indeed, if the observed sex differences in this type of work stem from of anatomical differences , then these anatomical differences should more accurately predict the perception of self-orientation than sex. from this perspective, it may be appropriate to consider specific individual differences other than sex per se in future research on the perception of spatial orientation.

CONCLUSIONS
sex differences have been found for many spatial tasks  <cit> . our findings are consistent with studies on circular vection  <cit> , field dependence  <cit> , and perception of verticality with body tilt  <cit> . indeed, without significant blood redistribution and when whole body rotation did not immediately precede a perceptual judgment, sex differences in the perception of spatial orientation were observed. as such, sex differences in the perception of self-orientation appear to be associated with sources of gravireception. it has been suggested that anatomical differences explain the perceptual differences  <cit>  and there are sex differences in the size of the otoliths  <cit> . however, many other sources of gravireception must be assessed  before fully understanding the sensory contributions to sex differences in the perception of spatial orientation.
