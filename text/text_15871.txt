BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus causes infections ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and septicaemia. since their emergence in the 1960s, methicillin-resistant s. aureus have become one of the major causes of hospital-acquired  infections such as implant-associated and postsurgical wound infections, as well as of community-acquired  infections such as pneumonia. the success of these hospital-acquired mrsa  clones can be partly attributed to virulence-specific factors, such as extracellular toxins, surface structures facilitating tissue colonization, immune evasion and tissue destruction  <cit> , as well as to prolonged persistence of mrsa infections linked to the formation of biofilms in vivo  <cit> .

it is generally accepted that biofilms, comprising conglomerations of cells attached to a solid support and embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymers, represent a major problem in clinical practice, due to their formation on implanted medical devices  <cit>  and their intrinsic enhanced resistance to antibiotics that are otherwise efficacious against the bacterium’s planktonic life forms  <cit> . these biofilm-associated complications have triggered the search for potential genes and/or metabolic pathways, interruption of which could represent new therapeutic or preventive interventions specifically targeting this bacterial life-style. functional genomics approaches such as transcriptomics and proteomics, performed on biofilm versus planktonic cells, have shed some light on the complexity of the biofilm phenotype in s. aureus. among genes found to be up-regulated in biofilm cells were those encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin / polymeric n-acetyl-glucosamine  as well as proteins mediating transport, amino acid metabolism and translation, with many other up-regulated genes encoding hypothetical proteins of still unknown function  <cit> . subsequent proteomic studies performed by resch et al.  <cit>  showed still more stringently that biofilm-induced proteins are involved in cell attachment and peptidoglycan synthesis, in pyruvate and formate metabolism, as well as in regulatory processes, in particular those exerted by the staphylococcal accessory regulator a protein.

we recently screened a large collection of clinically important mrsa isolates for their ability to form biofilms, and subsequently typed these isolates  <cit> . this work yielded a number of strong biofilm-forming strains, with three of them belonging to the usa <dig> clonal lineage, one of which was selected for genome sequencing. subsequent comparison of the strain’s genome with those of other usa <dig> sequenced isolates revealed a particularly interesting pair of closely related usa <dig> strains showing notably different capacities for biofilm formation . this finding offered the opportunity to search in clinical isolates at genome level for mechanisms of biofilm formation. thus, various usa <dig> s. aureus clones, which are closely related as per whole genome mapping, but markedly different in biofilm formation, were compared at genome level and consequently genetic loci with different alleles were identified. corresponding knockout mutants of these genes, obtained from a publically available mutant library of the same clonal lineage , were then phenotypically characterized for their potential role in biofilm formation. transposon-mediated interruption of one of the tested divergent genes, sausa300_ <dig>  corresponding to the gene faka, resulted in drastically increased levels of biofilms as compared to the parental control strain je <dig>  marking this gene as an important determinant of biofilm formation. these results shed more light on the genetic factors regulating biofilm formation in s. aureus.

transduction experiments
transduction was performed essentially as described  <cit> . transducing phage ϕ <dig> was obtained from the supernatant of a culture of the lysogenic s. aureus strain rn <dig>  and propagated on s. aureus rn <dig>  by standard techniques  <cit> . a transducing phage stock was prepared by infection at 37 °c of s. aureus containing the bursa aurealis transposon insertion. after infection of cultures of the recipient s. aureus strains  with this stock, transductants were selected on lb plates with  <dig>  % sodium citrate containing 5 mg/l erythromycin at 37 °c. the resulting colonies were purified at least twice on the same medium to ensure loss of the transducing phage.

complementation experiments
to complement the s. aureus mutant strain ne <dig>  total genomic dna of strains uas <dig> and tch <dig> was purified with the quick pick™ sml gdna kit  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. s. aureus strains were lysed by adding 5 μg lysostaphin . the genes corresponding to sausa300_ <dig> from the s. aureus strains uas <dig> and tch <dig> were amplified using extaq dna polymerase  with the primer pair glyk- <dig>  and glyk- <dig> . polymerase chain reactions  were carried out in an applied biosystems  <dig> thermal cycler using ex takara dna polymerase. annealing and elongation temperatures were 55 °c and 68 °c respectively, with an elongation time of 1 min per 1000 bp. during 30 cycles. pcr-fragments were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit  and analysed by gel electrophoresis on  <dig>  % agarose gels. the resulting 1753 bp. pcr fragments were cloned by the infusion technique  in the ecori site of the shuttle vector palc <dig>  <cit>  yielding the plasmids phd <dig>  and phd <dig> . dna sequencing was performed at the vib core sequencing facility  using the palc <dig> vector primers tetr <dig> , palc- <dig> , and the internal gene sequence primers glyk- <dig>  and glyk- <dig> . these plasmids were transferred into the restriction-deficient intermediate s. aureus cloning host rn <dig> to adapt the plasmid dna  <cit>  to the s. aureus modifications. transformants were selected on lb plates supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol . the plasmids phd <dig> and phd <dig> were isolated from the rn <dig> strain and used to transform strain ne <dig>  uas <dig> was also complemented with the wild-type faka allele carried on phd <dig> 

rna extraction and rt-pcr
mutant strain ne <dig> and wild-type strains fpr <dig> and je <dig> were grown as overnight cultures in 10 ml of bhi medium at 37 °c with shaking. total rna of the three bacterial strains was extracted after 16 h growth using express amptec kit . two μg of rna was treated with dnase using the turbo dna-free™ kit  and subsequently used for reverse transcription reaction using the reverse transcription system  with random primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. real-time pcr was performed using a steponeplus™ system  in a 20 μl reaction mixture with absolute blue qpcr sybr green rox mix . for rt-pcr analysis, the cdna samples were amplified with gene-specific primers 1162 f  and 1162rev , in duplicate. cycling conditions were 95 °c for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °c for 15 s and 60 °c for 60 s and 72 °c for 40 s. amplification plot and melting curve were analysed for the dynamics of fluorescence and specificity of amplification, correspondingly. resulting pcr products were checked by gel electrophoresis.

whole genome mapping
for wgm, uas <dig> and tch <dig> were grown on bhi plates, and high molecular weight dna was extracted from the overnight colonies using argus® hmw dna extraction kit . following dna extraction as recommended by manufactures protocol, dna molecules were loaded on a mapcard surface  where single dna molecules were immobilized and linearized. the linearized dnas were subjected to in situ digestion with ncoi . following digestion, the dna molecules were stained with the fluorescent intercalating agent jojo- <dig> forming part of the staining kit . the digested and stained dna fragments were imaged and assembled by in built assembler of map manager to produce whole genome restriction maps, as described previously  <cit> . finally, derived whole genome maps were analysed using bionumerics v <dig> . .

genome sequencing
the complete genome sequence of uas <dig> was generated by using the illumina hiseq <dig> platform, as described previously  <cit> . sequence data of uas <dig> were de novo assembled using velvet  <cit>  and spades  <cit> . assembled contigs were ordered against the uas <dig> whole genome map using mapsolver software . validated scaffolds were ordered against published s. aureus genome tch <dig> , and the generated pseudo chromosome was compared to the genomes of tch <dig> and fpr <dig>  using mauve v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . similarly, we also performed reference assembly independently by using the genome sequences of tch <dig> and fpr <dig> as references, and snps were extracted in clc genomics workbench  <dig> . <dig> . the assembled chromosome of uas <dig> was annotated as described  <cit> . multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed using mega <dig>  <cit> .

flow biofilm assay and quantification of biofilm mass
a medium-throughput continuous flow system bioflux  <dig>  was used to study biofilm formation under shear flow conditions, which mimics flow conditions of physiological liquids in the human body  <cit> . bhi or  <dig> xbhi with  <dig>  % glucose was used to feed into the flow cell. bacterial cultures at  <dig>  macfarland were then used to inoculate the output wells; bacteria were pushed through the flow cell from the output well up to the horizontal microfluidic channel by reversing the flow and were allowed to attach for one hour followed by 16 h of incubation at 37 °c in bhi or  <dig> xbhi with  <dig>  % glucose at a flow rate of  <dig>  dyne/cm <dig>  biomass in the microfluidic channels was stained with syto  <dig> fluorescent stain . biofilm images were captured employing zen  <dig> software  as combined tile images consisting of  <dig> one μm <dig> horizontal tiles covering the entire microchannel. actual fluorescence quantification was recorded as integrated density on the entire combined tile image using image j freeware  using “integrated density”, “mean value” and “area” as measurement settings. presented values are averages of three independent combined tile images.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis of biomass formation in the dynamic flow assay was performed using the r project software . the influence of a particular gene interruption on biofilm formation and the comparison of the space occupied by the cells within the dynamic biofilms were analysed using a pairwise one-way anova, shapiro-wilk normality testing, bartlett’s test of variances, and tukey’s honest significance difference testing. results from rt-pcr were analysed through a wilcoxon signed-rank test. p <  <dig>  were considered to be significant.

RESULTS
typing and phenotypic analysis of usa <dig> isolates
whole genome mapping  allowed typing and grouping of strain uas <dig> with sepsis strain usa300_tch <dig>  isolated at texas children’s hospital in houston  <cit>  along with two other s. aureus usa <dig> strains, usa300-fpr <dig>  and its plasmid-cured laboratory derivative usa300-je <dig> , both belonging to the usa <dig> clonal lineage. according to the wgm similarity cut-off recently established for usa <dig> isolates  <cit> , a wgm-based clonal cluster is defined as a set of isolates having a whole genome map similarity of >95 %, which assigned all four isolates discussed here to the same wgm clonal cluster . as uas <dig> was previously identified as a prolific biofilm former  <cit> , we directly compared its biofilm forming capacity to the other clonally related strains in a dynamic biofilm assay. comparison of uas <dig> with the other usa <dig> isolates in this dynamic biofilm model consistently revealed clear differences in this strain’s ability to form biofilms under these conditions, with uas <dig> forming  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold more biofilm than the other three usa <dig> strains, as measured by readout of fluorescence  .fig.  <dig> whole genome maps of usa <dig> strains. green lines indicate identity of restriction pattern among the maps and red horizontal marks represent the variations

identifying potential gene targets by comparative genomics
genomic divergence between phenotypically diverse strains from the usa <dig> clonal lineage should by definition be very limited  <cit> . since tch <dig> was closely related to uas <dig> as per wgm and its total genome sequence is already available  <cit> , we reasoned that comparing the whole genome sequences of uas <dig> and tch <dig> would likely yield genetic differences that could account for the observed differences in the biofilm phenotype between these two usa <dig> strains. we thus sequenced the uas <dig> genome by using the illumina hiseq <dig> platform  <cit> , and identified a total of  <dig> gene loci where uas <dig> and tch <dig> exhibited single nucleotide polymorphisms  , of which  <dig> mapped within open reading frames  and  <dig> within intergenic regions.

based on genome sequence data and comparison of whole genome maps , fpr <dig> is closely related to tch <dig>  <cit> , and thus also to uas <dig>  and forms less biofilms in the dynamic biofilm model, compared to uas <dig>  and similar to tch <dig>  . as the complete sequence for fpr <dig> is also available, we then compared uas <dig> and fpr <dig> and identified a total of  <dig> gene loci where uas <dig> and fpr <dig> exhibited snps , of which  <dig> mapped within orfs and  <dig> within intergenic regions. to further narrow down this initial list of deviating genes, we identified an overlap between the gene alleles of uas <dig>  tch <dig> and fpr <dig> . this reduced the initial list of genetic variations between strains uas <dig> and tch <dig> to only those snps that were identical in the two weak biofilm forming strains tch <dig> and fpr <dig> but different in uas <dig>  potentially identifying those snps primarily responsible for the increased biofilm formation in uas <dig>  this comparison yielded  <dig> snps as shown in table  <dig>  of this, snps in transposases and phage-elements  were excluded from further analysis .table  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  between tch1516/fpr <dig> and uas <dig>  consensus base represents tch <dig> and fpr <dig>  allele represents a corresponding base in uas <dig>  predicted amino acid changes in uas <dig> compared to tch <dig> and fpr <dig> were not displayed for synonymous snps

2the abbreviation  refers to ‘frame shift mutation’



similarly, comparative genome alignment was performed for tch <dig>  fpr <dig> and uas <dig> to confirm the data obtained by whole genome sequencing .

identification of genes involved in biofilm formation using gene knockout mutants
in order to investigate the role of the corresponding genes in biofilm formation, we obtained  <dig> mutants from the network on antimicrobial resistance in s. aureus  library in which transposon insertions map in genes affected by snps, belonging to the above identified group of  <dig> genes enumerated in table  <dig>  for the remaining four candidate genes, usa300hou_ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  corresponding knockout mutants were not present in the library and these were not studied further. we also randomly selected five genes affected by snps solely in either tch <dig> or fpr <dig> in comparison to uas <dig>  in total, the  <dig> mutants obtained from the narsa library  were phenotypically tested in duplicate for their ability to form flow biofilms using the library parental strain je <dig> as the corresponding control. significant positive and negative variations of the degree of biofilm formation as compared to je <dig> were found . out of the  <dig> mutants tested , one mutant ne <dig> showed a 2-fold increase in biofilm formation compared to je <dig> . ne <dig> harbours the transposon insertion at position  <dig> in orf sausa300_ <dig> encoding the fatty acid kinase faka located in the genome from position  <dig> to 1225586 nt  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> biofilm formation of usa <dig> strains in the dynamic shear flow assay. quantification  and visualization  of biofilms formed by je <dig> and its transposon mutants



reverse transcription pcr  was performed to determine whether the bursa aurealis insertion had affected transcription of sausa300_ <dig>  primers were designed downstream of the transposon mutation. transcription of sausa300_ <dig> in ne <dig> showed a significant decrease compared to that in wild-type strains fpr <dig> and je <dig>  . similar decrease in transcription was also observed for the tch1516-erys and the uas391-erys strain transduced with the sausa300_ <dig> mutated allele from ne <dig>  .fig.  <dig> transcription levels of the faka gene in uas <dig>  tch <dig>  fpr <dig>  je <dig> and in corresponding transductant strains. transcription levels of faka were measured in duplicate by real-time rt-pcr and expressed as an amplification plot and ct mean values



the sausa300_ <dig> in uas <dig> harbours a non-synonymous snp  as compared to strains tch <dig> and fpr <dig> . blast search identified it as a unique snp and it can thus be considered as the mutant version of the corresponding gene present in tch <dig> and fpr <dig>  with similar wild-type alleles being present among other sequenced s. aureus isolates .

transductants mutated in faka gene exhibit elevated biofilm formation
in order to further corroborate the negative role of faka in biofilm formation by usa <dig>  the knockout mutation in gene sausa300_ <dig> was transferred from ne <dig> into both uas391-erys and tch1516-erys employing phage-mediated transduction resulting in uas391-ne <dig> and tch1516-ne <dig>  respectively. knocking out sausa300_ <dig> in tch <dig>  resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in biofilm formation compared to the wild type tch <dig> , and at levels similar to the wild-type uas <dig>  . this effect was also observed in the uas <dig> background where uas391-ne <dig> exhibited even more abundant biofilm formation than the wild-type uas <dig>  .

a plasmid-borne copy of the wild-type faka gene complements the mutant phenotype
in order to unambiguously prove that the enhanced biofilm phenotype observed in the ne <dig> strain is indeed due to the knockout mutation of the faka gene, the mutant strain was complemented with a plasmid-borne intact faka allele present in the tch <dig> strain or with the corresponding snp-containing allele present in the uas <dig> strain, yielding ne229-phd <dig> and ne229-phd <dig> strains, respectively. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the amount of biofilm produced by ne229-phd <dig> was  <dig> -fold lower as compared to ne <dig> , and similar to the amount of biofilm produced by the parent je <dig> strain , whereas the amount of biofilm produced by ne229-phd <dig>  containing only mutant faka allele was the same as in ne <dig> . additionally, complementing uas <dig> with phd <dig> resulted in a  <dig> -fold decrease in biofilm mass as compared to the parent uas <dig> .

discussion
by comparing the whole genome sequences of closely related usa <dig> strains that strongly differed in their capacity to form biofilms in a dynamic flow model, identified genetic differences  were hypothesized to be responsible for this altered biofilm phenotype. seventeen transposon mutants knocked out in these genes in the usa300-je <dig> background  were evaluated for the degree of biofilm formation in comparison to the parent je <dig>  transposon-mediated interruption of one of the tested divergent genes, faka  <cit> , previously known as vfrb  <cit> , resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in biofilm formation as compared to the parental control strain je <dig>  in the other usa <dig> strains, uas <dig> and tch <dig>  the faka::tn mutations also led to increased biofilm formation, and further complementation experiments confirmed the role of faka in the regulation of biofilm formation.

running the protein sequence of sausa300_ <dig> in simple modular architecture research tool  identified two domains within the protein sequence: dak <dig> encoding the predicted phosphatase domain of the dihydroxyacetone kinase family , and dak1_ <dig> encoding the kinase domain of the dihydroxyacetone kinase family . the glutamic acid to glycine change is located at position  <dig> of the protein corresponding to its kinase domain. these proteins, collectively called dak <dig> domain proteins have homologues in a wide variety of bacteria. transposon insertions in faka were first isolated in a large s. aureus transposon  insertion mutants library screen based on an increased resistance to an antimicrobial peptide  <cit> . importantly, this faka  mutant exhibited an altered membrane phospholipid composition compared to its wild-type parent  <cit> . recent studies have further delineated the multiple functions of faka as an important regulator of virulence factors  <cit>  and as a fatty acid kinase responsible for host fatty acid incorporation by s. aureus  <cit> . interestingly, in the present study, complementation by the faka allele of tch <dig>  which is the consensus allele, in the faka::tn ne <dig> and in the uas <dig> strains decreased the amount of biofilm formation by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, to the level observed in the je <dig> wild-type strain. however, similar complementation by the uas <dig> faka allele, which harbours the glutamic acid to glycine change, did not affect biofilm formation in faka::tn ne <dig>  taken together, these results imply that the mutation in the uas <dig> faka might have impacted the catalytic activity of the kinase, and whether uas <dig> exhibits an altered membrane phospholipid composition due to this amino acid change, which increased its biofilm forming ability, remains to be studied.

interestingly, microarray-based gene expression data from a usa <dig> faka::tn mutant showed significant up-regulation of  <dig> and down-regulation of  <dig> genes  <cit> . the down-regulated genes included saep and saeq that are part of the saers two-component regulatory system and are known to regulate the activity of the saes-encoded sensor histidine kinase  <cit> . the saers system was also recently shown to be a negative regulator of biofilm formation in s. aureus  <cit> . this study showed that a s. aureus newman ∆saers strain exhibited an enhanced biofilm phenotype, similar to the faka::tn je2-ne <dig> mutant and the uas <dig> wild-type strains in our study. taken together, these phenotypic and gene expression data strongly suggest a potential interaction between faka and saers in negatively regulating biofilm formation in s. aureus. finally, mice infected with vfrb::tn  s. aureus have been shown to develop significantly larger abscess areas and dermonecrosis  <cit> , which also reflects the increased biofilm abundance observed for the faka::tn mutant in our study.

thus utilizing a combination of functional assays and genomics, we identified faka, a known virulence factor regulator and a fatty acid kinase, as an important negative regulator of biofilm formation in s. aureus usa <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the sequential approach used here, starting from comparing clonally related  clinical isolates with different clinically relevant phenotypes, then comparing the respective total genome information allowed to pinpoint a gene locus, that is clearly of relevance for biofilm formation in s. aureus.
