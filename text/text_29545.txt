BACKGROUND
corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that belongs to the so-called cmn  group, a distinct subgroup of the actinobacteria that also includes other highly important bacterial pathogens, such as corynebacterium diphtheriae and mycobacterium tuberculosis. the most distinctive feature of these gram-positive bacteria is the unique composition of the cell envelope, characterized by the presence of long chain fatty acids, known as mycolic acids, on the surface of the cell  <cit> .

the main recognizable disease caused by c. pseudotuberculosis is caseous lymphadenitis  in sheep and goats, though this bacterium can also infect several other hosts, including humans  <cit> . typical manifestations of cla in small ruminants include formation of abscesses in superficial and internal lymph nodes, and in visceral organs  <cit> . despite the important economic losses caused by this disease to sheep and goat husbandry worldwide, no effective treatment exists, and the efficacy of the currently available vaccines and diagnostic methods is still controversial  <cit> .

the search for c. pseudotuberculosis molecular determinants that contribute to cla pathogenesis lead to the recognition of two exported proteins as the major virulence-associated factors of this bacterium known to date: a secreted phospholipase d   <cit> ; and an abc-type transporter component of an iron uptake system   <cit> . in fact, one might expect that the majority of the virulence determinants of c. pseudotuberculosis would be present in the exoproteome, i.e. the entire set of bacterial proteins found in the extracellular milieu  <cit> . this is because exported proteins participate in essential steps of the host-pathogen interplay, including:  adhesion to host cells;  invasion;  damage to host tissues;  resistance to environmental stresses during infection; and  subversion of the host's immune response mechanisms  <cit> .

in two previous attempts to characterize the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome, our group optimized a protocol of salting out of proteins using sulfate and butanol, known as three-phase partitioning , for isolation of the extracellular proteins of this bacterium  <cit> , and generated a library of c. pseudotuberculosis mutant strains possessing transposon insertions in genes coding for probable exported proteins  <cit> . in the former study, we were able to determine the optimal conditions for obtaining the best recovery of immunoreactive extracellular proteins of c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . the second study in turn, enabled us to identify various previously uncharacterized c. pseudotuberculosis exported proteins, being that at least two of them are apparently involved in virulence  <cit> . now, the very recent conclusion of the c. pseudotuberculosis genome project by our group, associated to the current availability of high-throughput proteomic technologies, permitted us to perform a much more comprehensive analysis of this bacterium's exoproteome.

in this study, we sought to implement a combined approach for comparative exoproteome analysis of different c. pseudotuberculosis strains. the strategy included:  the previously optimized tpp protocol for isolation of the extracellular proteins  <cit> ;  a newly introduced method of data-independent lc-ms acquisition  for protein identification and quantification  <cit> ; and  the recently developed tool surfg+ for in silico prediction of protein sub-cellular localization in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . we believe that the experimental approach used is very suitable for profiling bacterial exoproteomes, as it shown to be easily applicable to different strains with very good reproducibility. this is an advantage over what is commonly observed for proteomic approaches based on two-dimensional  gel electrophoresis, where there is more variability, but is apparently the method of choice for most of the bacterial exoproteome studies published recently  <cit> . furthermore, the lc-mse method provides high subproteome coverage, due to enhanced sensitivity, and allows for label-free analysis of differentially expressed proteins  <cit> ; this latter possibility enables the detection of variations in the exoproteomes of different strains that could be missed by simply profiling the exoproteins, and meets the growing interest in performing physiological proteomic studies of bacteria  <cit> .

we were able to identify  <dig> different c. pseudotuberculosis extracellular proteins with high confidence by analyzing the exoproteomes of two strains isolated from different hosts that presented distinct virulence phenotypes under laboratory conditions  <cit> . most of the identified proteins were predicted in silico to have an extracytoplasmic localization. to the best of our knowledge, these results compose the largest inventory of experimentally confirmed exoproteins of a single corynebacterial species to date. importantly, the comparative exoproteome analyses permitted us to speculate on the probable contributions of different c. pseudotuberculosis extracellular proteins to the virulence of this bacterium.

RESULTS
exoproteome analysis of corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis
the extracellular proteins of two c. pseudotuberculosis strains, one isolated from a goat  the other from a sheep , cultivated in a chemically-defined medium, were extracted/concentrated by the tpp technique. the trypsinized protein samples were then submitted to lc-mse analysis.

seventy soluble extracellular proteins of the  <dig> strain could be confidentially identified by this methodology, whereas the number of proteins identified in the exoproteome of the c <dig> strain was sixty-seven. altogether,  <dig> different c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteins were identified in this study . these findings agree with the results of previous experiments by our group, in which we have used a 2d-page based strategy for a preliminary appraisal of the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome . eighty protein spots, mostly concentrated in the pi range between  <dig>  and  <dig> , could be reproducibly visible in the 2d gels generated from tpp-extracted extracellular proteins of the  <dig> strain . the fact that we have found  <dig> proteins in the exoproteome of this strain with high confidence when using the lc-mse method  indicates that this novel methodology allowed us to identify virtually the complete set of extracellular proteins that are commonly observed in the gel based methodologies . moreover, the expected existence of protein isoforms among the eighty protein spots observed in the 2d gels, and the identification by lc-mse of many proteins out of the pi range  <dig> - <dig> , suggests that the latter methodology is much more suitable for obtaining a comprehensive coverage of the bacterial exoproteome. noteworthy, is the use of lc-mse for exoproteome profiling which required  much less time and labor than the gel based proteomic strategy, and  much less protein sample necessary for each experimental replicate, with only  <dig>  μg per replicate used in the lc-mse compared to  <dig> μg for the 2d gels .

the performance of the combined methodology used in the present study  for mapping the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome was very similar for both strains analyzed, as can be seen by the average numbers of peptides observed per protein in the two proteomes  and by the average sequence coverage of the proteins identified  . consistent with this, the majority of the proteins detected in each extracellular proteome were shared by the goat and sheep isolates; this permitted us to define a core c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome composed of  <dig> proteins out of the  <dig> different extracellular proteins identified. additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> list all the proteins identified in the exoproteomes of the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains, along with molecular weights, isoelectric points, main orthologs, predicted sub-cellular localizations, number of peptides experimentally observed, and sequence coverage.

searches of similarity against publicly available protein databases using the blast-p tool  <cit>  showed that ortholog proteins can be found in the pathogenic corynebacterium diphtheriae for most of the identified c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteins , as would be expected due to the close phylogenetic relationship of these species  <cit> . nevertheless, no significant orthologs could be found for six proteins of the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome, even when using the position-specific iterated blast  algorithm  <cit> , namely the proteins , , , , , and  . with the exception of , all these proteins were predicted by different tools as being truly exported proteins. this means they are the only five exoproteins identified in this study which are probably unique for c. pseudotuberculosis.

prediction of sub-cellular localization of the identified proteins
most of the proteins identified in the exoproteomes of the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains were also predicted to have a probable extracytoplasmic localization after in silico analysis of the sequences of these proteins with different bioinformatics tools, thereby corroborating our in vitro findings . it is important to note here that we are considering the exoproteome as the entire set of proteins released by the bacteria into the extracellular milieu. that means we are looking to:  proteins possessing classical signals for active exportation by the different known mechanisms, which are directly secreted into the cell supernatant or that remain exposed in the bacterial cell surface and are eventually released in the growth medium  <cit> ; and  proteins exported by non-classical pathways, without recognizable signal peptides  <cit> . besides, one might also expect to observe in the extracellular proteome a small number of proteins primarily known to have cytoplasmic localization; although some of these proteins are believed to be originated from cell lysis or leakage, like in the extreme situation reported by mastronunzio et al.  <cit> , a growing body of evidence suggests that moonlighting proteins  may be commonly found in the bacterial exoproteomes  <cit> .

by using the recently developed tool surfg+ we were able to classify the identified c. pseudotuberculosis proteins into four different categories:  secreted,  potentially surface exposed ,  membrane and  cytoplasmic . basically, this software brings together the predictions of global protein localizations performed by a series of well-known algorithms, and innovates by allowing for an accurate prediction of pse proteins  <cit> . this possibility of classification provides us with valuable information on the proteins identified, as bacterial surface exposed proteins are believed to play important roles in the host-pathogen interactions during infection and many of these proteins have been shown to be highly protective when used in vaccine preparations  <cit> .

from a total of  <dig> different c. pseudotuberculosis proteins identified in this study, 75%  could be predicted as containing signals for active exportation  following surfg+ analysis . taken together, these proteins represent roughly 50% of all predicted secreted proteins in the recently sequenced genome of c. pseudotuberculosis, and around 15% of all predicted pse proteins of this bacterium .

the concordance of our in vitro identification of exoproteins with the in silico predictions of protein exportation is higher than what has normally been observed in recent exoproteome analyses of different bacteria  <cit> . for comparison, hansmeier et al.  <cit>  reported that exportation signals could be predicted in only  <dig>  out of  <dig> different proteins identified in the extracellular and cell surface proteomes of corynebacterium diphtheriae. the authors of this study are not the only to speculate on a probably important contribution of cross-contamination of the protein sample during preparation procedures for the observation of high numbers of proteins not predicted as having extracellular location in the bacterial exoproteomes  <cit> . we believe that the proportionally higher identification of proteins possessing exportation signals in the present study could have happened due to a series of different factors, including:  our methodology for isolation of the bacterial extracellular proteins might have extracted less "contaminant" cytoplasmic proteins than did other methodologies reported in previous studies;  the combined strategy used by surfg+ to predict protein sub-cellular localization might have performed better in the identification of exported proteins than happened with other strategies, sometimes based in only one prediction tool;  the fact that we have included in the final exoproteome lists only proteins identified with high confidence, in at least two experimental replicates, reduced significantly the possibilities of false-positive identifications that might account for some of the unexpected proteins; and finally  the lower proportion of proteins primarily regarded as cytoplasmic might be actually a typical characteristic of the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome.

non-classically secreted proteins
intriguingly, a much higher proportion  of the exoproteome of the  <dig> strain of c. pseudotuberculosis was composed by proteins predicted by surfg+ as not having an extracytoplasmic location, when compared to only  <dig> % in the exoproteome of the strain c <dig> . the possibility of these proteins being non-classically secreted has been evaluated using the secretomep algorithm  <cit> . we have also reviewed the literature for evidence of other bacterial exoproteomes that could support the extracellular localization found for these proteins in our study.

high secp scores  could be predicted for  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins in the exoproteome of the  <dig> strain considered by surfg+ as having a cytoplasmic location ; this could be an indicative that they are actually being secreted by non-classical mechanisms  <cit> . nonetheless,  <dig> of these  <dig> proteins  were also detected in the exoproteome of the c <dig> strain, in which they were predicted by surfg+ as possessing an extracytoplasmic location . a comparative analysis of the sequences encoding these proteins in the genomes of the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains showed that the disparate results were generated due to the existence of nonsense mutations in the genome sequence of the  <dig> strain, which impaired the identification of signal peptides for the two proteins at the time of surfg+ analysis . we believe that it is unlikely that these differences represent true polymorphisms, as the proteins were identified in the extracellular proteome, indicating the real existence of exportation signals. this indeed demonstrates the obvious vulnerability of the prediction tools to the proper annotation of the bacterial genomes. on the other hand, the assignment of high secp scores to these two proteins, even though they are not believed to be secreted by non-classical mechanisms, would be totally expected, as the secretomep is a predictor based on a neural network trained to identify general features of extracellular proteins; this means the prediction tool will attribute secp scores higher than  <dig>  to most of the secreted proteins, regardless the route of export  <cit> .

we have found reports in the literature that strongly support the extracellular localization observed for  <dig> of the  <dig> remaining proteins considered as non-secretory by surfg+ and secretomep in the exoproteome of the  <dig> strain, and without any detectable signal peptide . among these proteins there are the elongation factors tu and ts  <cit> ; the glycolytic enzymes triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglycerate mutase  <cit> ; the chaperonin groes  <cit> ; a putative peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase  <cit> ; and a hydroperoxide reductase enzyme  <cit> .

proteins primarily regarded as cytoplasmic have consistently been identified in the exoproteomes of different bacterial species, and moonlighting roles in the extracellular environment have already been demonstrated for some of them  <cit> , including evasion of host's immune system  <cit> , adhesion to host cells  <cit> , folding of extracytoplasmic proteins  <cit> , and interaction between microorganisms  <cit> . noteworthy, specific evidences for active secretion of such cytoplasmic proteins have been demonstrated for only a few examples to date, and demonstration of an extracellular function is still missing for many of these proteins  <cit> .

the variant exoproteome may account for differential virulence of the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains
a considerable number  of the extracellular proteins identified in this work was observed in only one of the two strains studied, then composing a variant experimental c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome . highly variant exoproteomes have also been reported recently for other gram+ bacterial pathogens  <cit> , and such a variation may be considered an important factor leading to the observable phenotypic dissimilarities and ultimately to differential virulence of the various strains  <cit> . hecker et al.  <cit>  reported on how the composition of the exoproteome can vary extremely within a single species, staphylococcus aureus, being that only  <dig> out of  <dig> identified extracellular proteins were found in all the twenty-five clinical isolates studied.

one of the most intriguing results in the present study was the detection of the phospholipase d  protein only in the extracellular proteome of the strain c <dig> . as the regulation of pld expression was demonstrated to be complex and highly affected by multiple environmental factors  <cit> , we sought to detect this protein in the culture supernatant of the c. pseudotuberculosis  <dig> strain grown in a rich medium  instead of only chemically-defined medium , but these attempts were also unfruitful . besides, we were not able to detect secretion of pld following total exoproteome analysis of the  <dig> strain grown under specific stress generating conditions . the results strongly indicate that this protein is actually not being secreted by the  <dig> strain in culture.

pld is an exotoxin considered as the major virulence factor of c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . it possesses sphingomyelinase activity that contributes to endothelial permeability and then to spreading of the bacteria within the host  <cit> . mutation of the pld gene in c. pseudotuberculosis rendered strains no longer capable of causing caseous lymphadenitis  in sheep and goats; the potential of these strains to be used as live attenuated vaccines was already evaluated  <cit> . similarly, the strain  <dig> of c. pseudotuberculosis was already tested as a possible live attenuated vaccine against cla due to its natural low virulent status, and administration of this bacterium to goats did not cause lesions formation  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms leading to the low virulence of the  <dig> strain however remain undetermined so far. we believe that non-secretion of pld might be one of the main factors responsible for the lowered virulence of the strain. importantly, we currently cannot affirm that the  <dig> strain does not produce this protein while infecting a mammalian host. besides, this strain still retains the capability of causing localized abscesses and disease in susceptible mice .

other proteins believed to be associated with the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis were also identified exclusively in the exoproteome of the c <dig> strain, namely fagd and cp <dig> . the former protein is a component of an iron uptake system, whose coding sequences are clustered immediately downstream of the pld gene in the c. pseudotuberculosis genome  <cit> . the latter protein is a secreted serine protease shown to be protective against cla when used to vaccinate sheep  <cit> .

‡ the inclusion criteria followed three main requisites:  experimental detection of the proteins in the exoproteomes of the pathogenic c. diphtheriae and c. jeikeium;  non-detection of the proteins in the exoproteomes of the non-pathogenic c. glutamicum and c. efficiens; and  in silico detection of ortholog proteins in pathogenic, but not in non-pathogenic, corynebacteria through search of similarity against public protein repositories.

a this protein list is not meant to be all-inclusive. rather, it wants to give an overview of the exported proteins identified in this study for which it was possible to speculate on a probable involvement in c. pseudotuberculosis virulence after comparative proteomic analyses.

strikingly, one variant protein of the c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteome, a conserved hypothetical exported protein with a cutinase domain , has its coding sequence present in the genome of the c <dig> strain but absent from the genome of the  <dig> strain . the genomic structure of the gene's surroundings is indicative of a region prone to recombination events, such as horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . in fact, it seems that gene gain and loss are frequent events leading to variations observed in the bacterial exoproteomes  <cit> .

variation of the core exoproteome: differential expression analysis of the common proteins by lc-mse
in addition to identifying qualitative variations in the exoproteomes of the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains, we were also able to detect relative differences in expression of the proteins common to the two proteomes through label-free protein quantification by the lc-mse method. relative protein quantification by this method can be obtained with basis on the accurate precursor ion mass and electrospray intensity data, acquired during the low energy scan step of the alternating scan mode of ms acquisition  <cit> . importantly, this quantitative attribute of the technique opens up new possibilities of utilization, as grows the interest on the so-called physiological proteomics  <cit> .

thirty-four out of  <dig> proteins commonly identified in the exoproteomes of the strains  <dig> and c <dig> of c. pseudotuberculosis were considered by the plgs quantification algorithm as having significantly variable expression  . if we further filter these results for the proteins presenting differential expression higher than 2-fold between the strains, we end up with only four proteins up-regulated in the  <dig> strain and sixteen in the c <dig> strain .

among the group of proteins not presenting considerable variations in expression between the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains, proteins probably participating in basic bacterial physiological processes could be easily identified, as would be expected, including cell shape maintenance and cell division   <cit> ; and iron uptake and utilization   <cit>  . in this sense, one might also speculate that the hypothetical proteins identified as non variant in the two strains may have functions associated to the general physiology of c. pseudotuberculosis, when grown in minimal medium.

the most up-regulated proteins were observed in the extracellular proteome of the c <dig> strain, including two cell envelope-associated proteins  <cit> , namely the major secreted  protein ps <dig> , and the s-layer protein a  . this may be indicative of differences on cell envelope-related activities in the two c. pseudotuberculosis strains, such as nutrient acquisition, protein export, adherence and interaction with the host  <cit> . dumas et al.  <cit>  compared the exoproteomes of listeria monocytogenes strains of different virulence groups, and found that altered expression  of a protein related to the bacterial cell wall could be a marker of specific virulence phenotypes. additionally, surface associated proteins have been shown to undergo phase and antigenic variation in some bacterial pathogens, and ultimately affect the infectivity potential of different strains  <cit> .

comparative analyses of corynebacterial exoproteomes
recent studies attempted to characterize the extracellular proteomes of other pathogenic  and non-pathogenic  corynebacterial species  <cit> . all these studies used 2d-page to resolve the extracellular proteins of the different corynebacteria, and pmf by maldi-tof-ms was the method of choice in most of them for protein identification  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the numbers of proteins identified in the exoproteomes of all strains studied, in comparison to the numbers obtained in the present study for c. pseudotuberculosis. despite one study with the strain r of c. glutamicum, which reports identification of only two secreted proteins  <cit> , all the corynebacterial strains had somehow similar numbers of extracellular proteins identified, ranging from forty-seven in c. jeikeium k <dig> to seventy-four in c. diphtheriae c7stox-. importantly, the fact that we have identified in this study  <dig> different exoproteins of c. pseudotuberculosis, through the analysis of two different strains, means that our dataset represents the most comprehensive exoproteome analysis of a corynebacterial species so far.

regardless the different methodologies employed to characterize the exoproteomes of the various corynebacteria, we sought to identify extracellular proteins commonly identified in most of the studies, taking the catalogue of c. pseudotuberculosis exoproteins generated in this work as the comparison dataset. besides corroborating our findings, the objective here was to identify extracellular proteins that could be associated exclusively to pathogenic corynebacterial species.

in total,  <dig> proteins identified in the exoproteome of the strain  <dig> of c. pseudotuberculosis were found to be present in the experimentally determined extracellular proteomes of other corynebacteria, whereas the number of common corynebacterial exoproteins in the c <dig> strain was  <dig> . only  <dig> proteins were consistently identified in all the corynebacterial exoproteomes, including pathogenic and non-pathogenic species:  s-layer protein a  <cit> ;  resuscitation-promoting factor rpfb  <cit> ;  cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii  <cit> ;  a putative esterase;  a nlp/p <dig> family protein   <cit> ; and  a trehalose corynomycolyl transferase . interestingly, three of these six proteins are predicted to be regulated by the same transcription factor , a member of the camp receptor protein  family of transcription regulators which are found controlling a diversity of physiological functions in various bacteria  <cit> .

twelve proteins of the exoproteome of the  <dig> strain and fifteen of the c <dig> strain were also detected experimentally only in the exoproteomes of other pathogenic corynebacteria, namely c. diphtheriae and c. jeikeium . altogether, this represents  <dig> different c. pseudotuberculosis proteins . a search of similarity using the sequences of these proteins against publicly available databases, believed to contain the predicted proteomes of all corynebacteria with completely sequenced genomes, showed that  <dig> of these  <dig> proteins are apparently absent from non-pathogenic corynebacterial species . moreover,  <dig> of these proteins are predicted to be part of regulatory networks already shown to be involved in virulence functions, including those regulated by the diphtheria toxin repressor -like protein  <cit>  and the camp-binding transcription regulator glxr  <cit> .

two proteins presented orthologs highly distributed in various bacterial pathogens:  a putative iron transport system binding  protein ; and  a putative glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase . interestingly, an ortholog of this latter protein was included recently in a list of seventeen proteins found to be very common in pathogenic bacteria and absent or very uncommon in non-pathogens, representing then probable virulence-associated factors  <cit> . in fact, reports in the literature can be found that associate orthologs of the two aforementioned proteins with virulence phenotypes  <cit> . noteworthy, both proteins were detected in this study only in the exoproteome of the c <dig> strain of c. pseudotuberculosis, the more virulent one.

CONCLUSIONS
there seems to be a growing interest in profiling the exoproteomes of bacterial pathogens, due to the distinguished roles played by exported proteins on host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . classical proteomic profiling strategies, normally involving two-dimensional  gel electrophoresis, have been extensively used for this purpose  <cit> . nevertheless, the introduction of more high-throughput proteomic technologies brings new perspectives to the study of bacterial exoproteomes, as it makes it easier to analyze multiple phenotypically distinct strains, yielding better subproteome coverage with fewer concerns regarding technical sensitivity and reproducibility  <cit> . besides, the currently available methods for label-free quantification of proteins  <cit>  allow us to compare the "dynamic behavior" of the exoproteome across different bacterial strains, and this in turn will help us to better identify alterations of the exoproteome that may contribute to the various virulence phenotypes.

by using a high-throughput proteomic strategy, based on a recently introduced method of lc-ms acquisition   <cit> , we were able to perform a very comprehensive analysis of the exoproteome of an important veterinary pathogen, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. comparative exoproteome analysis of two strains presenting different virulence status allowed us to detect considerable variations of the core c. pseudotuberculosis extracellular proteome, and thereby the number of exoproteins identified increased significantly. most importantly, it was helpful to gain new insights into the probable participation of c. pseudotuberculosis exported proteins, other than the well-known pld and fagb, in the virulence of this bacterium. several novel targets for future work on c. pseudotuberculosis molecular determinants of virulence can be identified from the catalogue of exoproteins generated in this study. interestingly, around 30% of the proteins identified were predicted by the surfg+ software  <cit>  as being probably surface exposed in c. pseudotuberculosis. such proteins may represent promising new candidates for composing a cla vaccine more effective than the ones currently available  <cit> , as has been demonstrated for a series of other bacterial pathogens  <cit> . therefore, it will be critical to further study the role of this protein set in virulence and vaccine design.
