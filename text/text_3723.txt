BACKGROUND
during early mammalian development, the zygote cleaves several times and gives rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages before implantation occurs. after compaction in the mouse embryo, the outer cells of the morula are epithelialized and become trophectoderm , while the inner cells generate the pluripotent inner cell mass . the surface of the icm adjacent to the blastocyst cavity differentiates into primitive endoderm , precursor cells of the extraembryonic endoderm  lineage. pre subsequently differentiates into visceral endoderm  and parietal endoderm   <cit> . ve forms layers of columnar epithelial cells covering the epiblast and contributes to the visceral yolk sac, while pe migrates along the surface of the inner te, secreting extracellular matrix to form the reichert's membrane and contributes to parietal yolk sac as well  <cit> . these exen lineage cells are important in embryonic development, as nutritive supports and as a determinant of the anterior-posterior axis.

in early mouse development, the gata family zinc-finger transcription factors gata <dig> and gata <dig> are specifically expressed in exen  <cit> . expression of gata <dig> starts at  <dig>  dpc in icm in a salt-and-pepper pattern, which is restricted to parietal endoderm at  <dig>  dpc  <cit> . gata <dig> knockout mice are embryonically lethal at  <dig>  –  <dig>  dpc due to defects in pre formation and subsequent exen development  <cit> . gata6-null embryonic stem  cells fail to undergo ve differentiation in vivo and in vitro  <cit> , and differentiation into exen does not occur, although gata4-null es cells can be induced to undergo epithelial differentiation by retinoic acid.  <cit> . this suggests that gata <dig> function is required for early exen, including pre, as well as for the development of both ve and pe.

leukemia inhibitory factor  is required to maintain the pluripotency of mouse es cells in conventional culture conditions; withdrawal of lif causes es cells to differentiate into pre-like cells  <cit> . overexpression of the pou family transcription factor oct3/ <dig> induced pre-like differentiation with up-regulation of gata <dig>  <cit> , similar to the withdrawal of lif, and overexpression of either gata <dig> or gata <dig> is sufficient to trigger the differentiation of es cells into exen, which are similar to pe in morphology and gene expression pattern  <cit> . this indicates that es cells possess the ability to differentiate into cells of the exen lineage, although they merely contribute to exen after injection into blastocysts <cit> .

extra-embryonic endoderm  cells derived from blastocysts continuously propagate in vitro, while maintaining their ability to contribute to exen lineage cells after injection into blastocysts  <cit> . the morphology and expression of marker genes of xen cells is similar to that of es-derived pe cells induced by gata <dig> or gata <dig>  suggesting that gata-transfected es cells may acquire xen-like exen characteristics in vitro, although this has yet been confirmed.

here, we report that an exen cell lines derived from mouse es cells by the artificial activation of gata factors acquire xen-like properties. we characterized these cell lines, which we have designated gexen cells, in comparison with embryo-derived xen cells. gexen cells express specific marker genes for exen and differentiate into both pe and ve in vitro. moreover, their contribution in vivo is restricted to the exen lineage, as is that of xen cells. although gata activation is continuously required for the propagation of gexen cells during early passages, these cells can propagate without artificial activation of gata in later passages, at which time endogenous gata factors expression is induced and maintained. we show that gata factors play a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining gexen cells.

RESULTS
continuous propagation of exen cells induced from es cells by ectopic expression of gata <dig> or gata6
by functional screening of transcription factors whose expression is upregulated after induction of differentiation in es cells, we found that the gata-family transcription factors gata <dig> and gata <dig> could induce differentiation toward the exen lineage  <cit> . upon ectopic expression of gata <dig> or gata <dig>  es cells differentiated into dispersed refractive cells that resembled pe cells and expressed pe marker genes such as sparc  and plat , indicating that activation of gata <dig> and gata <dig> is sufficient for inducing pe-like exen differentiation in es cells.

xen cells derived from blastocysts were recently reported to show very similar morphology to gata <dig> or gata <dig> induced pe cells derived from es cells  <cit> . xen cells were robust on mouse embryonic fibroblast  feeder layer or 70% conditioned medium  from mef for several passages. however, the ability of exen cells derived from es cells to propagate following ectopic expression of gata <dig> or gata <dig> had not been determined. we therefore assessed the ability of gata <dig> and gata <dig> episomal transfectants with pe-like morphology to propagate in prolonged culture. we found, however, that these cells could be passaged fewer than three times in the culture conditions used for xen cells . since the episomal expression system tends to become destabilized after induction of differentiation , we tested skg <dig>  <cit>  and ebrtc-g <dig>  <cit>  es cells, both of which carry integrated copies of tetracycline -inducible gata <dig> transgenes and differentiate into pe-like cells after induction of ectopic gata <dig> expression following withdrawal of tc . we found that, although skg612-derived exen cells  could be passaged fewer than three times , ebrtc-g6-derived exen cells  propagated continuously for more than  <dig> passages on mef , suggesting that these pe-like cells acquire xen cell-like ability of proliferation.

pe-like cells were derived from 5g6gr, ebrtc-g <dig> and skg <dig> cells and grown with or without mef, and in the presence or absence of dex  or tc . passage numbers: +++, more than 10; +, 3-10; ±, less than 3; - impossible to grow.

to further investigate the role of the gata factors on exen differentiation and their xen cell-like characteristics, we established another inducible activation system for the gata factors in es cells by introducing a chimeric transgene composed of full-length gata <dig> or gata <dig> and the human glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain . introduction of pcag-g4gr-ip or -g6gr-ip into eb <dig> es cells resulted in the establishment of the es cell lines, 5g6gr  and 5g4gr , respectively. gfp-tagged g6gr showed that, in the absence of dexamethasone , the chimeric transgene products were kept inactive in the cytoplasm , whereas, in the presence of dex, they translocated into the nucleus , indicating that these chimeric molecules were properly regulated. although parental eb <dig> es cells had no morphological changes by the administration of dex , treatment with dex altered the morphology of these 5g6gr or 5g4gr es cells into dispersed, refractive and satellite type, reminiscent of pe cells. these cells, designated g6exen  and g4exen  as found in episomal transfectants of gata <dig> and gata <dig>  respectively, and were not similar to pre induced by the withdrawal of lif . thus, these results indicated that the hormone-inducible gata factors mimic the function of native gata factors in es cells.

g4exen and g6exen cells each had two distinct morphologies, depending on the culture conditions on gelatinized dishes. dispersed refractive cells were observed in gata <dig> or gata <dig> transfectants under low-density culture conditions , whereas an epithelial sheet-type morphology was observed under high-density conditions . in the presence of dex, these cells could be expanded on mef for more than  <dig> passages , similar to results for ebrtc-g6-derived exen cells . these data suggested that gexen cells acquire an ability to proliferate similar to that of xen cells.

high level of constitutive activation of gata factors can substitute for the mef requirement
withdrawal of mef was found to induce differentiation of xen cells by reduction of gata <dig> or induction of afp , a marker for ve in early embryos  <cit> . both skg <dig> and ebrtc-g6-derived exen cells showed limited capacity to propagate on gelatin-coated dishes in the absence of tc, indicating an absolute requirement for mef, as observed in xen cells . in contrast, gexen cells, derived from g4gr or g6gr es cells induced by treatment with dex, could be serially passaged on gelatinized dishes at about 1: <dig> dilution every  <dig> or  <dig> days . the culture period reached at least  <dig> passages for  <dig> g6exen lines , and at least  <dig> passages for  <dig> g4exen lines  on gelatinized dishes with no apparent senescence or reduction in viability , indicating that they had lost their requirement for mef for continuous propagation.

what is the molecular basis of the requirement of mef for xen cells? according to the original report by kunath et al., mef feeder layers can be substituted by the mef-cm, indicating that one or more soluble factors secreted by mef is required for xen cells. if this signal is required for the transcriptional activation of gata <dig> and/or gata <dig>  a constitutive supply of gata factors from the transgenes beyond the threshold level may override the mef dependency. since we applied different chimeric transgenes in different inducible systems for activation of gata factors and it was suggested that gata <dig> and gata <dig> possess cross- and auto-activation systems, simple measurement of the amount of transcripts for these transgenes, as well as the endogenous gene, was not a suitable indicator of the net gata activity achieved in these transgenic es cells. to achieve this, we used two different approaches;  transcriptional quantification of the endogenous gata target genes, and  measurement of the activity of gata-dependent reporters. when the luciferase  reporter carrying the gata <dig> promoter and the first intron , where the auto-regulatory elements are found in other gata family genes  <cit> , was introduced in 5g6gr and 5g4gr es cells, it was significantly activated within  <dig> hours in the presence of dex in both cell lines, strongly suggesting the direct activation of this reporter by gata <dig> and gata <dig> ' '. we quantified endogenous gata <dig> in es cells carrying various types of inducible gata <dig> transgenes and found that the expression levels of gata <dig> in g6gr and g4gr cells with dex were high, that of ebrtc-g <dig> with tc was moderate, and that of skg <dig> with tc was low, but still significantly higher than that of pre cells induced by withdrawal of lif . the expression levels of gata <dig> were varied in two xen cell lines established from blastocysts , but the ranges of the expression levels were comparable to those of es-derived exen cells . similar results were obtained for gata <dig> expression, suggesting the presence of its auto-and cross-regulation by gata factors. as the additional indicator, we chose fibroblast growth factor - <dig> because the direct regulation of its promoter by gata <dig> has been reported  <cit> . we confirmed that the activation of the pfgf3-luc and pfgf3-tk-luc reporter was comparable to that of pgata6-luc at  <dig> hours after induction of exogenous gata activities  and found that either the activities of pfgf3-luc/pfgf3-tk-luc or the transcription levels of endogenous fgf <dig> at  <dig> days after induction of exogenous gata activities were consistent with the hierarchy of the gata <dig> expression levels in these exen cells , indicating that the induced gata activity is highest in 5g6gr and 5g4gr, moderate in ebrtc-g <dig> and lowest in skg <dig>  this indicates a tight relationship between the ability to self-renew in the absence of mef and the induced activity of constitutive gata factors independent to exogenous signal, suggesting a role for the maintenance of gata activity at a high level in the propagation of xen cells under feeder-free conditions.

expression of exen marker genes in gexen cells
to investigate the detailed characteristics of g4exen and g6exen cells, we analyzed marker gene expression in passage  <dig> cells by quantitative pcr . we chose gata <dig>  <cit> , gata <dig>  <cit> , sox <dig> and sox <dig>  <cit> , and disabled homolog  <dig>  as exen markers, which are markers for exen, and found that all were induced in gexen cells at much higher levels than in pre from es cells induced by the withdrawal of lif . the expression levels of these markers were about 2-fold higher in g6exen than in g4exen cells, which might reflect functional differences between gata <dig> and gata <dig> as previously reported, in which gata <dig> is an upstream regulator of gata <dig> while gata <dig> is a negative regulator of gata <dig>  <cit> .

the level of expression of the pe markers plat  <cit> , snail  <cit> , and sparc  <cit>  in g6exen and g4exen cells was similar to that in pre cells , whereas expression of follistatin  and parathyroid hormone receptor  <dig>  was much higher in g6exen and g4exen cells than in pre cells .

the ve markers afp  <cit> , foxa <dig> , indian hedgehog , transthyretin , retinol-binding protein , apolipoprotein e , and cbp/p300-interacting transactivator with glu/asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain  <dig>  were also induced to an equivalent or higher extent in g6exen and g4exen cells than in pre cells . in contrast, the pluripotent cell markers oct3/ <dig> , nanog and zfp42/rex <dig>  as well as the trophectoderm markers cdx <dig>  hand <dig> and psx <dig> were hardly detected in gexen cells . these data fit the marker gene expression profile of xen cells reported previously.

immunohistochemical analysis showed that virtually all g4exen4- <dig> express gata <dig> in the nucleus  and dab <dig> in the cytoplasm , similar to embryo-derived xen cells , indicating that gene expression profile of gexen cells is homogeneous, as judged by their morphology.

g4exen and g6exen cells contribute to the parietal endoderm lineage in vivo
to determine the in vivo differentiation potential of gexen cells, we performed chimera analysis with cell lines carrying pcag-egfp-iz, 5g4gr-gfp and 5g6gr-gfp. these cell lines differentiated into gexen and showed strong egfp expression, with or without dex treatment, which was sufficient for the detection of their progeny cells at the single-cell level in chimeric embryos.

when 5g6gr-gfp es cells, without dex treatment, were injected into wild-type c57bl6/6j blastocysts and transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant mice, they generated  <dig> chimeric embryos, in which the egfp-positive cells contributed only to the embryonic portion and were never found in the extra-embryonic lineage . in contrast, when g4exen-gfp and g6exen-gfp cells derived from the dex-treated es cell lines 5g6gfp-gr and 5g4gfp-gr, respectively, were injected after several passages, they contributed exclusively to the extra-embryonic yolk sac, with a scattered pattern, a feature of pe in vivo, in the chimeric embryos : this result was previously observed for embryo-derived xen cells  <cit> . however, in all chimeras, the contribution of the gexen cells was restricted to the parietal yolk sac. a similar tendency was found for xen cell chimeras, in which xen cells in ve were observed in only  <dig> in  <dig> chimeras  <cit> . these findings indicate that g4exen and g6exen cells derived from es cells by artificial activation of gata <dig> or gata <dig> have the potential to contribute to only pe in vivo.

 <dig> g6exen cell clones  and  <dig> g4exen cell clones  were used to generate chimeras by blastocyst injection.

activation of exogenous gata factors is required for propagation of gexen cells in the early passage period
although in the presence of dex g4exen and g6exen cells are robust, even in the absence of mef , these cells gradually ceased to propagate and their morphology became flatter after withdrawal of dex . similar changes were observed in gexen cells cultured on mef, suggesting that continuous activation of gata-gr is absolutely required for the propagation of gexen cells.

to confirm the status of gexen cells with or without exogenous gata activity, we assayed expression of several ve and pe marker genes by q-pcr. expression of endogenous gata <dig> and gata <dig> was reduced by inactivation of gata6-gr in g6exen cells following withdrawal of dex . in addition, expression of the exen marker genes sox <dig> and sox <dig>  and the pe marker genes plat, snail and pthr <dig> were decreased after withdrawal of dex, whereas the ve marker genes afp hnf3b, ihh, ttr, rbp, apoe and cited <dig> were increased in parallel . these findings are similar to the gene expression profile in differentiated xen cells induced by the withdrawal of mef, in which decreasing expression of gata <dig>  and gata <dig> and several pe marker genes, and increasing expression of ve markers including afp, was observed  <cit> . therefore, withdrawal of exogenous gata <dig> activity induces differentiation of gexen cells, indicating that maintenance of gata <dig> activity is required for propagation of gexen cells.

establishment of endogenous gata expression restores dependency on exogenous gata activity
interestingly, over about  <dig> passages, the dependency of gexen cells on exogenous gata activity was gradually lost and they became able to propagate without dex. analyses of marker gene expression in these late passage gexen cells revealed that the expression levels of endogenous gata <dig> and gata <dig> were slightly higher than in early passage gexen cells . in contrast to early passage gexen cells , the expression levels of endogenous gata <dig> and gata <dig> were maintained after removal of gataf6-gr activity by withdrawal of dex . these data indicated that the positive auto-regulatory loop that maintains expression of endogenous gata factors was gradually established during cell culture.

to further determine whether gata <dig> activity is required to maintain propagation of late passage gexen cells, we performed a loss-of-function assay by silencing gata <dig> expression using a short-hairpin rna-mediated knockdown strategy. psil-h1puro expresses short hairpin rna under the control of the mouse h1-rna gene promoter. a vector targeting gata <dig>  psil-shg <dig>  was transfected into dex-independent puromycin sensitive g6exen cell line, 1d <dig>  and the transfectants were cultured for  <dig> hr under puromycin selection and then analyzed for exen marker expression by quantitative pcr. transfection efficiency in 1d <dig> cells was monitored by transient expression of egfp using pcag-egfp-ip vector transfected by the same protocol . facs analysis showed that about 95% of the cells were egfp-positive .

the level of expression of endogenous gata <dig> in the 1d <dig> cells transfected with psil-shg <dig> was about 50% of that in control cells transfected with psil-h1puro . after puromycin selection, the control cells exhibited no morphological changes , whereas the 1d <dig> cells stopped propagating and showed altered morphology, similar to that observed during ve-like differentiation induced by withdrawal of dex during the early passage period , including a 3-fold upregulation of afp relative to control cells . these data suggested that gata <dig> is absolutely essential for the propagation of gexen cells.

discussion
the systematic in vitro differentiation of es cells represents a powerful tool for analyzing the molecular mechanisms controlling pre-implantation development  <cit> . however, careful comparison of events observed in vitro and in vivo is required to use this model system properly. we have characterized gexen cells generated in vitro from es cells by the artificial activation of gata factors and confirmed that they mimic the characteristics of xen cells. gexen cells can be propagated continuously on gelatinized dishes by constitutive activation of exogenous gata activity, independent of the mef-derived signal, and contribute to exen in chimeric embryos, as do xen cells. although the in vivo contribution of gexen cells is limited to pe, these cells differentiate in vitro into cells morphologically and genetically similar to ve cells. in addition, we confirmed that gata <dig> is important for the propagation of gexen cells. these data clearly indicate that ectopic and continuous activation of gata <dig> or gata <dig> is sufficient to trigger proper differentiation of es cells into the exen lineage.

lineage specification by tissue-specific transcription factors is a key step in development. in mouse blastocysts, there are three cell lineages, icm, te and exen, with various cell lines derived from each. to date, several exen cell lines have been described, including the rat yolk sac carcinoma line l <dig>  <cit> , the re <dig> line from a rat blastocyst  <cit> , parietal endoderm cells  and xen cells  <cit>  from mouse blastocysts. of these, xen cells are regarded as the best model of exen development in vitro because of their origin and characteristics in vivo after injection into blastocysts. however, the molecular mechanisms of derivation and propagation of xen cells have not yet been analyzed, although the functions of gata factors in xen cells were suggested by both gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo, showing that gata <dig> and gata <dig> were necessary and sufficient to commit cells to the exen lineage  <cit> .

we have clearly shown here that gata factors play a central role in the induction and maintenance of gexen cells. although transient induction of ectopic gata <dig> or gata <dig> activity is sufficient to induce differentiation of es into gexen cells , inactivation of the exogenous gata activity in the early passage period prevented their propagation and the induction of terminal differentiation. in the late passage period, gexen cells were freed from their dependency on exogenous gata activity, but still had a tight requirement for endogenous gata expression. these findings indicate that gexen cell propagation is dependent on gata factors, and that this may also be applicable to embryo-derived xen cells.

although xen cells derived from blastocysts grow robustly on mef or in medium supplemented with 70% mef-cm, which contains many unknown factors, we found that gexen cell propagation is dependent only on the high level of the induced activation of gata <dig> or gata <dig>  without any exogenous factors. in contrast, ebrtc-g6-derived exen cells, which showed weaker expression of endogenous gata <dig> following induction of exogenous gata <dig> than gexen cells, mimic the mef-dependency of xen cells. since the requirement for mef can be satisfied by high-levels of gata factors, the soluble factors contained in mef-cm may activate the expression of endogenous gata factors, as we hypothesized. to date, we have tested the activity of several candidate soluble factors to substitute the role of mef feeders, but neither fgf <dig>  <cit> , a soluble factor abundantly expressed in pe, nor parathyroid hormone-like peptide  secreted from te, the ligand of the pthrp receptor expressed in pe, can substitute for activation of gata-gr fusion protein by dex to maintain the propagation of gexen cells under feeder-free conditions . in contrast, as suggested for the possible involvement of the lif signal for xen cell maintenance  <cit> , the addition of lif in the culture of gexen cells enhanced their propagation . the relationship between the activities of gata factors and the soluble factor in mef-cm will be tested using the in vitro model system with gexen cells and xen cells.

the role of mef-derived soluble factor might not be restricted in the transcriptional activation of endogenous gata <dig> and gata <dig>  it has been reported the post-translational modification of gata <dig> is important to acquire full transcriptional activity  <cit> . according to this report, acetylation of gata <dig>  which might be mediated by p <dig>  increases its dna-binding, resulting enhancement of its transcriptional activity. it is also possible that this pathway is regulated by mef-derived factor. efficient maintenance of exen cells without mef by activation of gata4gr or gata6gr might reflect their ability to compensate for both signal dependencies on transcription and post-translational modification by an unexpected effect of the fusion to the gr ligand binding domain.

gexen cells express many exen marker genes, including those specific for ve and pe. gexen cells have the potential to contribute to pe in vivo in chimeras, as do xen cells, indicating that activation of gata <dig> or gata <dig> is sufficient to induce proper differentiation of xen-like cells from es cells. however, as is the case for xen cells, gexen cells exhibit a strong bias to contribute to pe in chimeric embryos. indeed, gata <dig> is required for ve formation; gata6-null es cells fail to differentiate into ve on the surface of embryoid body  <cit> . during dex withdrawal-induced differentiation of early passage gexen cells in vitro, their morphology became flattened with ruffled membranes, reminiscent of ve following upregulation of ve markers, as found in xen cells. blastocyst injection showed, however, that pre and nascent ve cells directly isolated from embryos contributed mostly to pe, indicating that pre or ve dissected from icm or epiblast tends to become pe  <cit> . interestingly, casanova and grabel  <cit>  reported that ve-like cells derived from the embryoid bodies of f <dig> embryonal carcinoma cells maintain the ve phenotype on the surface of eb or gelatin-coated dextran beads but lose it rapidly under monolayer conditions, with repression of the ve marker afp and activation of the pe marker plat. therefore, the bias of gexen and xen cells to the pe phenotype may be due to 2-dimensional culture conditions, which are not permissive for maintenance of the ve phenotype.

as previously shown, we found that artificially-expressed gata <dig> or gata <dig> activated both endogenous gata <dig> and gata <dig>  <cit>  to maintain the propagation of gexen cells. after  <dig> passages, however, gexen cells gradually acquire the ability to propagate without activation of exogenous gata factors. such weaning from exogenous gata activity may be achieved by locking the auto-regulatory positive feedback loop between endogenous gata <dig> and gata <dig>  this may mimic the situation in vivo, where transient exogenous signals activating the expression of gata factors are required to generate the mature exen cell population that propagates continuously as it expands along the yolk sac. it is also possible to regard this phenomenon as an artificial condition generated by continuous activation of gata factors at high levels. in any case, since the embryo-derived xen cells never proliferate without mef, the balance of the transcription factors in these cell lines should be different, and a global comparison of their transcriptomes will provide a cue to solve the structure of the transcription factor network including gata <dig> and gata <dig> in exen cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have succeeded in the establishment of exen cell lines, that have the same character of xen cells derived from embryos, from es cells by the constitutive activation of exen specific transcription factor, gata <dig> and gata <dig> 

establishment of gexen cells, as with ts cells  <cit> , from es cells confirmed that the two differentiation events in mouse pre-implantation development could be mimicked by the in vitro activation of lineage-specific transcription factors. this model can be regarded as a powerful tool for investigating the transcriptional network transition from pluripotent stem cells to lineage-restricted cells.
