BACKGROUND
l-glutamate  has been proposed to play a role in neurotransmission in the peripheral taste system  <cit> . evidence supporting a role for glutamate as a transmitter includes the expression of glutamate receptors in taste cells  <cit>  as well as the presence of the glutamate transporter glast  <cit> . however, the origin of glutamate and its sites of action in the taste bud are not well understood. for example, glutamate could be released from taste cells to activate glutamate receptors on adjacent taste cells or afferent nerve fibers. alternatively, glutamate could be released from either gustatory or somatosensory nerve fibers to modulate the activity of taste cells. studies examining the function of glutamate as a transmitter in the taste system are complicated by the fact that glutamate is also a taste stimulus that elicits the umami taste  than those typically needed to activate neurotransmitter receptors   <cit> .

glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of vertebrates, acts on both ionotropic  and metabotropic  receptors. three pharmacological subtypes of iglurs are activated by glutamate: n-methyl-d-aspartate , -2-amino-3- propionic acid  and kainate receptors. of these, taste receptor cells express both nmda and kainate receptors, which are believed to respond to glutamate as a transmitter rather than a taste stimulus  <cit> , although the receptor subtypes and their expression patterns are not clear. in addition to iglurs, the peripheral taste system contains several mglurs, including mglur <dig>  <cit> , mglur <dig> and mglur <dig>  <cit> , and mglur <dig>  <cit> . these receptors, as well as the heterodimeric umami taste receptor t1r <dig> + t1r <dig> likely play a role in the detection of l-glutamate as a tastant, while the mglurs could also potentially play a role in taste modulation by glutamate released as a transmitter by taste cells or nerve fibers.

taste cells are aggregated in taste buds, which contain approximately 50- <dig> individual cells. generally,  <dig> types of taste cells are recognized based on functional and morphological markers. type i cells  share many features of glial cells in the nervous system  <cit> . these cells express enzymes for inactivation and uptake of transmitters  <cit> , including the glutamate transporter glast  <cit> . type ii cells, also called "receptor cells"  possess the g protein-coupled taste receptors and machinery for the transduction of sweet, bitter and umami compounds. these cells express downstream signalling effectors such as gα-gustducin, plcβ <dig>  ip3r <dig> and trpm <dig>  <cit> . although they do not form classical synaptic contacts with gustatory nerve fibers, type ii cells release atp via hemichannels to communicate with nerve endings and adjacent taste cells  <cit> . finally, type iii cells, also called "synaptic cells"  form conventional synapses with afferent gustatory nerve fibers  <cit> , although the identity of the transmitter at the synapse is not known. type iii cells contain and release serotonin  <cit>  and norepinephrine  <cit> , but also express gad <dig>  an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gaba  <cit> . in this study, we sought evidence for release and function of glutamate as a transmitter in the taste bud.

the participation of glutamate as a neurotransmitter would imply the presence of vesicular transporters for glutamate , which are responsible for the transport of glutamate from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles. vgluts comprise  <dig> isoforms, vglut <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are highly expressed in all glutamatergic neurons in the central nervous system . in addition, vglut <dig> is expressed in inner hair cells of the cochlea, where it is necessary for activation of auditory afferent neurons  <cit> . vgluts would also imply the presence of glutamate receptors on either nerve fibers or taste cells that are activated by concentrations of glutamate similar to those in the central nervous system. to address these questions, we used a combination of physiological, molecular and immunohistological techniques to show that vgluts are not detected in taste cells, but vglut <dig> and  <dig> are expressed in the afferent nerve fibers surrounding taste cells. further, we show that the kainate receptor glur <dig> is selectively expressed in type iii taste cells, where it may respond to glutamate released from afferent nerve terminals. portions of these results were recently presented in abstract form  <cit> 

RESULTS
expression of vesicular glutamate transporters  in taste tissue
glutamate is usually released via a vesicular mechanism, with the uptake of glutamate into vesicles regulated by vesicular glutamate transporters   <cit> . we extracted mrna from pooled taste buds isolated from circumvallate  and fungiform  papillae and used rt-pcr to determine if vgluts are expressed in taste cells. no rt-pcr products were detected for vgluts  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> in the isolated taste buds, although products of the correct size were expressed in brain . moreover, immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies against the vgluts did not label any taste cells . however, sections of circumvallate and fungiform papillae show that both vglut <dig> and vglut <dig> immunoreactivity are heavily expressed on nerve fibers innervating taste buds . no specific immunoreactivity for vglut <dig> was observed in taste cells or nerve fibers . since taste cells are surrounded by somatosensory as well as gustatory nerve fibers, we used an antibody against p2x <dig>  a specific marker of gustatory nerve fibers  <cit>  to determine whether the vglut <dig> antibody specifically labels gustatory nerve fibers. the double labeling showed that vglut <dig> is co-expressed with p2x2; i.e., all p2x <dig> fibers were immunoreactive for vglut <dig>  but a few vglut <dig> positive fibers did not label with the p2x <dig> antibody . this result suggests that the majority of vglut2-labeled fibers are gustatory fibers. to confirm this, we isolated mrna from the geniculate ganglion, which contains the cell bodies of the chorda tympani nerve fibers that innervate the fungiform taste buds. rt-pcr showed the expected expression of vglut <dig> and  <dig> in the ganglion . in addition, the ganglion was also sectioned and stained with antibodies against vglut <dig> and  <dig>  as well as p2x <dig>  the results confirmed that the majority of ganglion cells were immunoreactive for both vglut <dig> and  <dig> and that vglut2-immunoreactive cells also co-expressed p2x <dig> . we also examined co-localization of vgluts  <dig> and  <dig> in the ganglion, since in most systems these two vgluts are expressed in mutually exclusive neuronal populations  <cit> ). however, we found that nearly all geniculate ganglion cells co-expressed vglut <dig> and  <dig>  taken together, these results indicate that gustatory ganglion cells express vgluts and that these vgluts are targeted to the distal end of the fibers within taste buds.

taste cells respond to glutamate stimulation
vglut-labeled nerve fibers were present throughout the taste bud. labeled fibers appeared to associate with both trpm5-gfp labelled type ii cells  and gad67-gfp labelled type iii cells . to further investigate which cell type might be the target of glutamate released from nerve fibers, we used calcium imaging to test whether type ii and/or type iii taste cells respond to glutamate  applied at concentrations expected for a neurotransmitter. since taste cells may also respond to glutamate as a taste stimulus, we chose concentrations that would allow us to differentiate taste responses from putative neurotransmitter responses. for these experiments,  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm glutamate were used to elicit neurotransmitter responses, and  <dig> mm was used to activate glutamate taste receptors responsible for transducing umami taste  <cit> . transgenic mice expressing gfp from the t1r <dig> promoter were used to identify a subset of type ii taste cells  <cit> , those responding to umami and sweet taste stimuli, and mice expressing gfp from the gad <dig> promoter to identify type iii cells, since gad <dig> is expressed in a large subset of them  <cit> . in addition, cells were also stimulated with a  <dig> mm kcl solution. only type iii cells express voltage-gated calcium channels and respond to the application of kcl with an increase of intracellular calcium  <cit> . t1r3-gfp cells responded primarily to  <dig> mm glutamate. a total of  <dig> fungiform t1r3-gfp cells ,  <dig> circumvallate t1r3-gfp cells  and  <dig> palate t1r3-gfp cells  responded to glutamate at  <dig> mm . only  <dig> of these responding cells also responded to glutamate at  <dig> mm. in gad67-gfp cells, out of  <dig> circumvallate cells tested,  <dig> responded to  <dig> mm glutamate while  <dig> additional cells responded to  <dig> mm glutamate . all the gad67-gfp cells showed a response to the high k+ stimulation as expected. these results demonstrate a difference in the sensitivity of taste cells to glutamate, with type iii cells responding to concentrations likely to activate neurotransmitter receptors and type ii cells requiring a higher concentration of glutamate usually detected as a tastant.

glutamate receptors involved in the glutamate response
we used an ampa/kainate glutamate receptor antagonist, nbqx, to identify ampa/kainate ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in the response elicited by glutamate in type iii cells, since these cells responded to glutamate at concentrations expected for a neurotransmitter receptor. nbqx partially blocked the response to  <dig> mm glutamate  as shown in figure 6c, d. since previous studies have shown that taste cells fail to respond to ampa agonists  <cit> , we assumed that the receptor must be a member of the kainate family, and we designed primers against glur5- <dig> , ka <dig> , and ka <dig> . we used rt-pcr assays on mrna isolated from pooled circumvallate taste buds, fungiform taste buds and non taste tissue. glur <dig>  and ka <dig> and ka <dig> were present in circumvallate and fungiform papillae . non taste tissue was devoid of pcr products for these receptors. we used immunohistochemistry to identify the taste cells expressing glur <dig>  since ka <dig> and ka <dig> are usually associated with glur <dig> to form functional receptors  <cit> . an antibody against glur6/ <dig> labeled subsets of taste cells in circumvallate, but not fungiform papillae. in all circumvallate taste buds examined, glur <dig> co-localizes with a subset of gad67-gfp cells but not with trpm <dig> -gfp cells . these data demonstrate that glur <dig> is expressed specifically in type iii taste cells, which supports our results from calcium imaging studies.

discussion
our results suggest that the glutamate vesicular transporters, vglut <dig> and  <dig> are expressed in nerve fibers innervating taste buds but not in taste cells themselves. these data imply that afferent nerve fibers, rather than taste cells have the machinery to release glutamate into the taste bud to potentially modulate the activity of taste cells. further, we report physiological, molecular, and immunohistochemical evidence that one likely target of the glutamate is the kainate receptor glur <dig>  which is localized in type iii cells.

somatosensory nerve fibers originating from the trigeminal ganglion also penetrate taste buds, and their cell bodies express vglut <dig> and  <dig> isoforms e.g, figure.  <dig> <cit> . to differentiate the origin of the vglut-positive fibers , the p2x <dig> antibody was used as a marker for gustatory fibers, since cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion lack p2x <dig> expression  <cit> . our results show that the majority of vglut <dig> immunoreactive nerve fibers in taste buds also express p2x <dig>  suggesting a gustatory origin. we confirmed this by examining expression of vgluts in the geniculate ganglion, where the majority of the cells innervate taste buds on the tongue and palate. most vglut2-expressing geniculate cell bodies also expressed p2x <dig>  confirming that gustatory fibers express vglut <dig>  our data confirm those of a preliminary study showing expression of vglut <dig> and  <dig> but not  <dig> in nerve fibers associated with taste buds in mice  <cit> . however, another study recently reported immunohistochemical evidence for vglut expression in the taste tissue of rats, but only vglut <dig> was detected  <cit> . further studies will be required to determine if this is a species difference.

to determine which cell types would respond to glutamate at concentrations expected for a neurotransmitter, we performed calcium imaging studies on gfp-labeled type ii and type iii taste cells. gad67-gfp type iii cells showed responses to glutamate at concentrations of  <dig> mm  or  <dig> mm . in contrast, t1r3-gfp type ii cells failed to respond to  <dig> mm glutamate and only  <dig> out of  <dig> cells responded to  <dig> mm glutamate. however, several type ii cells responded to  <dig> mm glutamate, which is the appropriate concentration to activate the umami taste receptor, t1r1-t1r <dig> . these results strongly suggest that the neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate likely reside in the type iii cells rather than the type ii cells. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other type ii cells that do not express t1r <dig> may respond to low concentrations of glutamate. caicedo et al.  <cit>  showed that the responses to  <dig> mm glutamate are blocked by cnqx, a specific ampa/kainate antagonist. when injected into the lingual artery, cnqx also decreased taste responses of the chorda tympani  <cit> . our physiological experiments using nbqx, another ampa/kainate antagonist, confirm a role for ampa/kainate receptors in type iii mouse taste cells. however, the nbqx block was not complete, suggesting other receptors may participate in the glutamate response of type iii cells, as suggested by other investigators  <cit> .one possibility is the nmda receptor, previously identified in physiological studies of rat taste cells  <cit> . although our data suggest that the neurotransmitter receptors are restricted to type iii taste cells, we cannot rule out the possible role of mglurs in type ii taste cells that signal through the camp signaling cascade. metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to class ii  and class iii  elicit decreases in camp  <cit> , which would not be detected in a ca2+ imaging assay, since type ii taste cells lack voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit> . in addition, we would not be able to detect the presence of ionotropic glurs that are not calcium permeable. however, nmda receptors and kainate receptors are all ca2+ permeable, as are ampa receptors lacking glur <dig>  <cit> . we were not able to identify glur <dig> in pooled rna from circumvallate papillae , although some immunoreactivity was found for glur2/ <dig> in rat circumvallate taste buds  <cit> .

using rt-pcr performed on pooled taste buds from fungiform and circumvallate papillae, and immunohistochemistry on sections of circumvallate taste tissue, we have now identified specific kainate receptors involved in the glutamate response of type iii cells. rt-pcr products for glur <dig>  ka <dig> and ka <dig> were detected only in taste papillae and immunohistochemistry showed that an antibody directed against glur6/ <dig> specifically labels a subset of type iii taste cells. since glur <dig> was not detected in taste buds by rt-pcr, glur <dig> is the likely glur expressed in these taste cells. in the kainate family of iglurs, the glur5- <dig> subunits constitute the low-affinity subunits and the ka <dig> and ka <dig> subunits constitute the high affinity subunits. the ka <dig> and ka <dig> subunits fail to form a functional homomeric receptor but create a functional channel when they form heteromeric receptors with glur5- <dig> . interestingly, in hek cells transfected with homomeric glur <dig> or heteromeric glur7/ka <dig> or glur7/ka <dig>  the ec <dig> value in response to glutamate application is in the  <dig> mm range  <cit> , which is consistent with the levels of glutamate required to activate type iii cells in our physiological experiments. glur <dig> has been studied in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses where it forms heteromeric receptors with glur <dig> and ka <dig> and ka <dig>  as in taste cells, it forms a low affinity, ca2+ permeable channel where, when activated, it modulates the release of the presynaptic transmitter  <cit> .

the presence of vgluts in gustatory nerve fibers innervating taste cells clearly indicates that glutamate is stored in vesicles in the close vicinity of taste cells, where it could modulate the activity of type iii taste cells via activation of glur <dig>  interestingly, omega shaped images of clear vesicles, likely representing exocytotic release of transmitter, have been observed in nerve fibers abutting taste buds  <cit> . type ii "receptor" cells respond to taste stimulation by release of atp, which activates purinergic receptors on afferent nerve fibers  <cit>  and adjacent taste cells  <cit> . in response, type iii cells release 5-ht, norepinephrine and possibly additional transmitters  <cit>  to modulate type ii cells and activate nerve fibers, although the identity of the transmitter at the afferent synapse between type iii taste cells and nerve fibers is not known. these transmitters may activate the vglut-expressing afferent nerve fibers, which in turn would release glutamate to selectively modulate type iii taste cells. excess glutamate and atp would then be removed from the taste bud via transporters  <cit>  and degradative enzymes  <cit>  expressed in type i taste cells. the role of the glutamate modulation is unclear, but type iii cells are the only taste cells that are responsive to multiple taste stimuli  <cit> . we speculate that if glutamate is released from nerve fibers, this vglut-mediated circuit may participate in the broad tuning of the type iii taste cells as well as to modulate the release of the type iii cell transmitters.

CONCLUSIONS
the principal finding in this study is that gustatory afferent nerve fibers, rather than taste receptor cells, possess the machinery for vesicular release of glutamate in taste buds. further, we show that a potential target of glutamate released from nerve fibers is the kainate receptor glur <dig>  expressed selectively in a subset of type iii taste cells. we speculate that glutamate may be involved in a signalling circuit in taste buds to modulate transmitter release from type iii taste cells.
