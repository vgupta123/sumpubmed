BACKGROUND
glucocorticoids  have been widely used as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. they also play an important role in anti-cancer therapy. the potent capacity to kill lymphoid cells has led to their inclusion in all chemotherapy protocols for lymphoid malignancies  <cit> , e.g., prednisone combined with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine  acts as the standard first-line therapy for diffuse large b-cell lymphoma . besides, gcs are widely used as co-medication in cancer therapy of solid malignant tumors to prevent chemotherapy-related hypersensitivity reactions and other adverse effects such as nausea, emesis and toxic reactions  <cit> . before, during and after chemotherapy of solid malignant tumors, gcs are given at varying doses to reduce acute toxicity or to protect normal tissue  <cit> .

however, accumulating evidences show that the application of gcs may interfere with the therapeutic efficacy in anti-cancer therapy. it renders the majority of malignant tumor cells resistant to apoptosis and promotes proliferation in several established and primary carcinoma cancer cells  <cit> . dexamethasone , an important member of glucocorticoid family, has been approved to antagonize the efficacy of some anti-cancer drugs such as cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, actinomycin d, doxorubicin and gemcitabine  <cit> . in addition, m. xia found that dex could enhance the expression of cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated antigen - <dig> during t cell activation  <cit> , indicating that dex might suppress antitumor immune responses and facilitate tumor progression.

similar to ctla- <dig>  programmed cell death  <dig>  is a key cell-surface receptor of cd <dig> superfamily that triggers inhibitory pathways and dampens t-cell activity when bound by its ligands, pd-l <dig> or pd-l <dig>  <cit> . studies have shown that pd- <dig> is highly expressed on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and pd-l <dig> is commonly up-regulated on many different tumor types, resulting in the inhibition of local anti-tumor t cell responses  <cit> . cancers can elude immune surveillance through pd-1/pd-l <dig> pathway and pre-clinical studies demonstrated that high levels of expression of pd-l <dig> correlates with poor prognosis of cancer . however, it still remains unclear how the expression of pd- <dig> and its ligands are spatially and temporally regulated and what are the molecular mechanisms of signaling through pd- <dig> and its ligands. based on the evidence that dex could enhance ctla- <dig> expression  <cit> , we explored whether dex could enhance pd- <dig> expression as well. our results demonstrated that dex could also enhance the expression of pd- <dig> both in mouse and human activated t cells dose-dependently, which was mediated by glucocorticoid receptor .

RESULTS
kinetics of cell surface pd- <dig> expression during t cell activation
pd- <dig> is an inducible costimulatory molecule expressed on t cells, b cells, natural killer  cells, dendritic cells  and monocytes upon activation . previous study has examined that pd- <dig> is not expressed on resting t cells but is inducibly expressed within 24 h after stimulation  <cit> . as an initial step to understand the basis for the effect of dex on pd- <dig>  we first analyzed the dynamic changes of pd- <dig> expression on activated t cells. freshly isolated mouse splenocytes without stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. data showed there is almost no expression on resting cd3-positive t cells . then cells were stimulated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> beads at 1: <dig> bead-to-cell ratio for 1-7d. as shown in fig.  <dig>  both the mean fluorescence intensity  and proportion of pd-1+ t cells were up-regulated within 24 h and reached a peak at 48 h, followed by reduction in the next days. it returned to background levels by day  <dig>  on the basis of these findings, we chose 48 h as our next observation time point.fig.  <dig> kinetics of surface pd- <dig> expression of t lymphocytes during activation. cells were double-stained with percp-cy <dig>  labeled anti-cd <dig> antibody and either pe-labeled isotype control or anti-pd- <dig> antibody. a dynamic variation of mfi of pd- <dig> expression on mouse cd3+ t cells after activation. b dynamic variation of ratio of pd- <dig> expression on mouse cd3+ t cells after activation. c representative flow cytometry histograms of pd- <dig> expression  and isotype control  gated on cd3+ t cells from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after activated . d representative dot plots showing the percentage of t cells expressing pd- <dig> from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after activated . data shown are representative of three independent experiments



dex enhances pd- <dig> expression both in mouse and human activated t cells
to investigate the effects of dex on pd- <dig> expression in mouse t cells after activation, dex at different doses  were added to culture medium at the same time with activation. forty-eight hours later, cells were collected for flow cytometry. results suggest that dex dose-dependently enhanced the expression of pd- <dig> at 48 h with ec <dig> values of 10−7 m . though data showed dex at 10−9 m slightly reduced the expression than control, this difference has no significance  . to further explore whether this effect exists during whole activation, mouse t cells were incubated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> beads in the absence or presence of 1 × 10−7 m dex from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  we found dex enhanced pd- <dig> expression at each time point, with difference more significantly from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  . these results confirmed our hypothesis that dex could enhance pd- <dig> expression during t cell activation. we also observed that surface expression of pd- <dig> was upregulated in both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells . besides, our results revealed that dex did not induce pd- <dig> expression in unstimulated t cells .fig.  <dig> effects of dex on pd- <dig> expression on activated t cells. a mouse t cells were incubated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> beads for 48 h in the absence or presence of various doses of dex . b mouse t cells were incubated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> beads in the absence or presence of 1 × 10−7 m dex for  <dig> to 7 days. dex significantly increased pd- <dig> expression. c dex increased pd- <dig> expression in both cd4+ and cd8+ subsets of mouse t cells. d dex increased pd- <dig> expression in both cd4+ and cd8+ subsets of human t cells. e analysis of pd- <dig> mrna level in dex-treated and untreated t cells by real-time pcr analysis. data are presented as the mean fold change in pd- <dig> mrna level normalized to the β-actin mrna. f western blot analyses confirming higher expression of pd- <dig> protein in dex-treated t cells. data represents mean ± sem of three experiments. *p <  <dig> . **p <  <dig> 



to ascertain whether dex exerts similar effect on human t cells, we treated activated human t cells with dex . the flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that following 48 h treatment, dex also increases surface pd-1expression significantly in both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells .

effect of dex on pd- <dig> mrna and protein level
to determine whether dex affected pd- <dig> expression at the mrna level, mouse t cells were stimulated for 2 days with or without dex . as shown in fig. 2e, quantitative rt-pcr determined that pd- <dig> mrna was increased significantly by dex. the mean augmentation of pd- <dig> mrna by dex-treated group was determined to be more than fourfold over that of dex-untreated group.

western blot analysis showed that addition of dex to activated t cells resulted in a significant increase of pd- <dig> protein . these data showed that dex-induced augmentation of pd- <dig> expression by flow cytometry analysis correlates with an augmentation of both pd- <dig> mrna and pd- <dig> protein.

ru <dig> overcomes dex-induced upregulation of pd- <dig> expression
gcs mediate their well-defined transcriptional effects via a cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor  which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. in the cytoplasm, gcs interact with gr, leading to nuclear translocation of the activated receptor and subsequent binding to negative or positive gr responsive elements  in the promoter regions of target genes  <cit> . ru <dig> has been described as a gr antagonist and was used to block activities of gcs mediated through gr.

in order to determine if the dex-induced increase in pd- <dig> expression is due to specific glucocorticoid-gr interaction, the ability of ru <dig> to block the hormone effect was studied. splenocytes were stimulated in the presence of dex  alone or dex plus various doses ru <dig> . the results showed that the augmentation of pd- <dig> expression by dex was dose-dependently inhibited by ru <dig> , indicating that the effect of dex on pd- <dig> is mediated through the gr.fig.  <dig> ru <dig> inhibits dex-mediated increase of pd- <dig> expression. a cells were cultured for 48 h in  medium  with 1 × 10−7 m dex or  1 × 10−7 m dex plus 1 × 10−5 m ru <dig> for 48 h. cells were stained with isotype control  or pe-labeled anti-pd- <dig> antibody . b cells were cultured for 48 h with 1 × 10−7 m dex or 1 × 10−7 m dex plus different doses of ru <dig> or 1 × 10−7 m ru <dig> alone. data is presented as the mean ± sem of three experiments. *p <  <dig> . **p <  <dig> 



different t cell subsets show different sensitivity to dex-induced upregulation of pd- <dig> expression
t cells can be divided into several different subsets according to their functional and phenotypic features. according to the expression of the differentiation markers cd <dig> and cd62l, t cells can be divided into three subsets. a naïve phenotype  is characterized by expression of low levels of cd <dig> and high levels of cd62l . when naïve t cells react to antigen during the immune response, a small proportion of the responding cells survives to form antigen-specific memory t cells ; these cells are typically cd44hi, with some of the cells being cd62lhi  and others being cd62llo   <cit> . flow cytometry results showed that the expression of pd- <dig> had a significant difference between them, with tem expressing the highest level and tn the lowest . interestingly, these three subsets we gated are differentially modulated by dex in terms of pd- <dig> expression. dex induced a strong upregulation of pd- <dig> on tcm and tem, but a weaker upregulation on tn .fig.  <dig> different t cell subsets differ in their expression of pd- <dig> and sensitivity to dex. cells were incubated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> beads for 48 h in the absence or presence of 1 × 10−7 m dex. a based on the expression of cd <dig> and cd62l, four subsets were gated: cd44−cd62l+ , cd44+cd62l+ , cd44+cd62l−  and cd44−cd62l− . b representative flow cytometry histograms show pd-1expression differs in tn, tcm and tem, with tem expressing the highest level and tn the lowest. c tcm, tem are more susceptible to dex-induced upregulation of pd- <dig>  data is presented as mean ± sem of three experiments. **p <  <dig> 



effect of hydrocortisone  on pd- <dig> expression in mouse t cells
in order to assess whether less potent gcs have the same effect, we treated activated mouse t cells with hydrocortisone  for 48 h. similar to dex, results showed that hc also increases surface pd- <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was inhibited by ru <dig> . since hc is less potent than dex, we noted that only at high dose with a concentration of 10−5 m can hc induce this effect significantly. lower concentrations of hc caused weak effect of this kind. thus we concluded that the effect of gcs on pd- <dig> expression depends on their potency and dose. at the same dose, more potent gcs such as prednisone and dex could exert greater effect than less potent gcs like cortisol. besides, we observed that the effect of hc on different subsets in terms of pd- <dig> were all in line with dex .fig.  <dig> effects of hc on pd- <dig> expression in mouse t cells. a activated mouse t cells were cultured in medium, hc  or hc  plus ru <dig>  for 48 h. surface pd- <dig> expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was inhibited by ru <dig>  b pd- <dig> expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner both in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. c tem are more susceptible to hc-induced upregulation of pd- <dig>  data is presented as mean ± sem of three experiments. **p <  <dig> 



effects of dex on the function and apoptosis of activated t cells
gcs are potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. their immunosuppressive effects have been ascribed to their modulation of gene transcription, whereby they inhibit the production of a number of cytokines , such as interleukin- <dig> , interferon-γ , and tumor necrosis factor-α   <cit> . in vitro studies have also shown that the engagement of pd- <dig> by pd-l <dig> or pd-l <dig> inhibited tcr-mediated t cell proliferation and cytokine production including il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α  <cit> .

to validate the effect of dex on the function of activated t cells, culture supernatants of mouse t cells activated for 48 h with dex  or not were assayed for the production of cytokines il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α by elisa. results shown in fig. 6a displayed significantly  decreased levels of il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α in dex-treated group compared to dex-untreated group, suggest that dex suppressed the production of cytokines and inhibited the function of activated t cells.fig.  <dig> effects of dex on the function and apoptosis of activated t cells. activated mouse t cells were cultured with dex  or medium for 48 h. a culture supernatants were collected and assayed for il- <dig>  tnf-α and ifr-γ. data are shown as the mean values  for triplicate cultures for each experiment. the results are from two independent experiments. statistically significant differences between medium alone and dex-treated groups was evaluated at *p <  <dig>  or **p <  <dig> . b following 48 h incubation, cells were analyzed for apoptosis by fitc-annexin v and pi staining by flow cytometric analysis. annexin-v-, pi- cells were live cells, annexin-v+, pi- cells were early apoptotic cells, annexin-v+, pi+ cells were late apoptotic and dead cells were pi positive. c the percentages of apoptotic cells were labeled as annexin v+ cells. data is presented as mean ± sem of three experiments. **p <  <dig> 



since dex is known to be an apoptotic agent, we also evaluated the apoptosis at different times  of treatment. results showed significant higher levels of apoptosis in dex-treated cells .

discussion
activation of the immune system is recognized as an important treatment strategy against cancer. however, gcs suppress the immune system and many studies have shown that immunosuppression can exacerbate the metastatic process and accelerate tumor growth  <cit> . the present study was designed to examine the effects of gcs on pd- <dig> expression during the course of t cell activation. to explore the possible effects, we first address the biological features of pd- <dig>  using flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrated that surface expression of pd- <dig> on activated t cells peaked on day  <dig> and returned to background levels after 6 days. this dynamic expression was in agreement with previous studies  <cit> .

next we used dex as a model glucocorticoid. our data demonstrate for the first time that dex could enhance the expression of pd- <dig> during activation of t cells. this finding is of great importance for the widespread use of dex in anti-cancer therapy as well as the crucial role of pd- <dig> in tumor immunity. as an immune checkpoint, pd- <dig> serve to suppress the activity of t cells and dampen the immune response. tumors can exploit this checkpoint and facilitate tumor progression. this significance sheds light on the development of monoclonal antibody targeting pd- <dig> against many cancers. two antibodies that block pd- <dig>  pembrolizumab  and nivolumab , have been approved to treat advanced or inoperable melanoma and the clinical responses are encouraging  <cit> . therefore, the upregulation of pd- <dig> induced by dex very likely protects cancer cells from being detected and eradicated by immune system, resulting in faster tumor growth and poor prognosis in anti-cancer therapy. we also validated that dex could suppress t cell functions via inhibition of cytokines production such as il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α and induction of apoptosis of t cells. in this respect, administration of dex to cancer patients may do harm to cancer patients.

besides, we found that both dex and hc enhances pd- <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the dose of gcs administered to patients is of great importance. widely used in high doses in the therapy of leukemia and lymphomas, gcs are highly suspicious to impair the effect of chemotherapy in the clinical setting of such cancers. for example, in the r-chop regimen for dlbcl, high dose of prednisone may suppress the activity of nk cells and t cells as well as the specific antitumor immune response triggered by rituximab, thus unfavorable to the protective immunity. in this way we suggest that alternative drugs should be applied instead of gcs or use low dose of gcs in anti-cancer therapy. we should minimize our application of glucocorticoids, especially high dose of glucocorticoids. our data also showed the effects induced by dex were completely inhibited by ru <dig>  indicating that the effect of dex on pd- <dig> is mediated through gr. a better understanding of the mechanism elucidating these effects is needed and will require further research into the downstream signals.

it should be noted that memory t cells were the subpopulation more susceptible to dex-induced upregulation of pd- <dig>  the higher sensitivity on memory t cells detected in this study may result in their faster apoptosis via pd- <dig>  which helps explain why treatment with dex could induce a significant decrease of memory t cells accompanied by a relative increase of naïve t cells . in fact, memory t cells have more powerful potent to recognize tumor antigens and to exert immune response against cancers than naïve t cells. in this sense, the selective effect on memory t cells of dex further validate its immunosuppressive role.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide evidence that dexamethasone could suppress immune response by enhancing pd- <dig> which may result in faster tumor growth and poor prognosis in the clinical setting of anti-cancer therapy. we strongly suggest that gcs have negative influence on anti-cancer therapy despite their benefits for patients. it is necessary to minimize our application of glucocorticoids, especially high dose of glucocorticoids in anti-cancer therapy. further studies on the dual role of gcs are needed.
