BACKGROUND
it is estimated that more than  <dig> bacteria per gram of dental plaque colonize the human oral cavity. more than half of them still remain uncultivable. their existence is only known because a fingerprint in form of a sequence from a gene fragment, most often from 16s rdna, could be traced in a clinical sample  <cit> . all oral microorganisms form biofilms on surfaces such as the oral mucosa, the tongue, or the surface of the teeth. many supragingivally predominant bacteria belong to the firmicutes phylum  with the lactic acid producing bacteria  as the largest and clinically important subgroup  <cit> . comprising streptococci, lactobacilli, and granulicatella/abiotrophia species , lab are main constituents of the commensal microbiota of the human oral cavity, but form also part of the biofilms colonizing the upper respiratory, intestinal and urinary tracts. in the oral cavity, they are thought to play major roles in dental plaque formation and oral biofilm homeostasis. however, under conditions of prolonged shifts of biofilm composition, lab may induce dental caries through excessive lactic acid formation  <cit> , and upon penetration into the blood stream lab may cause in susceptible individuals a variety of life-threatening conditions such as endocarditis, septicemia, or meningitis  <cit> .

in situ techniques that allow monitoring individual cells and cell populations within biofilms are important tools to investigate natural biofilm ecologies  <cit> . however, few probes for the detection and quantification by fluorescent in situ hybridization  of oral lab species have been described so far  <cit> . here we report the design, characterization and pilot evaluation of probes recognizing major phylogenetic clusters or species of oral lactobacilli, the abiotrophia/granulicatella group, and a few taxa of oral streptococci. applied for validation to in situ formed supragingival biofilms, the probes detected high levels of both mitis group streptococci and abiotrophia/granulicatella species, and identified strains of lactobacillus fermentum and the lactobacillus casei group.



RESULTS
probe design
in this study we relied for probe design on the species and phylotype description provided by the human oral microbiome database   <cit> , which comprises a collection of 16s rrna sequences of both cultivable and so far non-cultivable taxa representing the currently known width of bacterial diversity found in the human oral cavity  <cit> . oligonucleotide probes were designed with specificity for phylogenetic groups or species of lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, granulicatella and abiotrophia. table  <dig> lists all probes with their sequence and optimum formamide concentration. the latter was determined by systematic optimization in experiments with both reference strains and clinical plaque samples.

permeabilization of lactobacilli for fish
uniform permeabilization for fish of fixed lactobacilli  is a known problem  <cit> , in particular with certain 'notorious' strains. like other authors before, we have evaluated several permeabilization protocols that precede hybridization and obtained the best results with a modification of a procedure proposed by harmsen et al.  <cit>  . it was applied selectively to all lactobacillus probes and consists of a  <dig> min exposure to lysozyme and achromopeptidase, followed by a  <dig> min incubation with lipase.

fluorescence intensity and probe specificity
lactobacillus probes were tested with  <dig> reference strains representing the different oral lactobacilli clusters as described by the homd  and, with the exceptions of probe lab <dig> and lfer <dig>  displayed the anticipated reactivity profile. as an example figure 2a shows the staining of lactobacillus rhamnosus ac  <dig> with lcas467-cy <dig>  pointing at one of the strengths of single cell analyses with fish, strain lactobacillus crispatus atcc  <dig> was found contaminated with l. fermentum and required recloning . with several probes the fluorescence intensity was weak but could be significantly improved by adding non-fluorescent helper probes to the hybridization solution  <cit> , or by employing probes containing locked-nucleic-acids   <cit> . the former bind to regions of the 16s rrna that are adjacent to the target sequence thereby contributing to the opening of the rrna's 3-d structure and improving probe accessibility, whereas the latter contain one or two derivative nucleotide analogs with their ribose locked in a c3'-endo conformation which leads to a higher target selectivity of the probe. unexpected from in silico data, lab <dig> labeled the l. salivarius reference strain atcc  <dig> and lfer <dig> bound to the lactobacillus reuteri type strain ccug 33624t. the reasons for these exceptional hybridizations remain to be determined. generally, the lna-probes yielded high fluorescence intensity but also required high formamide concentrations to display the predicted specificity. in particular, l-lbre <dig> was cross-reactive with lactobacillus colehominis and l-lbuc <dig> was cross-reactive with some strains of both the l. casei and l. reuteri clusters if the formamide concentration was kept below 45%. similarly, the l-lcol <dig> probe was false positive with strains from the lactobacillus buchneri cluster at < 40% formamide. of the other probes listed in table  <dig>  abi <dig> was strongly positive with all four abiotrophia/granulicatella reference strains tested , whereas abi <dig> labeled only the granulicatella strains. probe lcc <dig> was positive with lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis reference strain ncc <dig>  <cit> , and the s. mutans and s. sobrinus probes smut <dig> and l-lsob <dig> stained reference strains ua159t and omz  <dig>  respectively, while none of the probes was positive with strains from other streptococcal species. probe l-ssob440- <dig> yielded better fluorescence intensity than the previously described probe sob <dig>  <cit> , but had to be used at high stringency. all these findings were as expected from in silico data.

enumeration of lactic acid bacteria from in situ formed biofilms
the applicability of the probes was tested with three in situ formed biofilm samples. the samples were harvested from bovine enamel discs carried in acrylic appliances on the buccal side of the mandibular premolar/molar regions  <cit>  by three volunteers whose discs differed greatly in the extent of demineralization  generated during the  <dig> days of intermittent extraoral exposure to a 5% glucose/5% sucrose solution. all samples were positive for lactobacilli as detected by the two broadly reactive lactobacillus probes lgc358a and lab <dig> . total cell numbers and numbers of lactobacilli were very similar to findings from an earlier study investigating the microbiota associated with the in situ development of caries  <cit> . both probes had to be used imperatively together with their respective competitor probes, since, without them, large numbers of cocci and other morphotypes were positive. in the biofilm from disc  <dig>  lgc358a stained clearly two populations of rods that differed in length, whereas lab <dig> identified only the shorter of the two morphotypes. the longer and predominant cell type had the probe reactivity profile lgc358a+/lab759-/lfer466+/lreu986+/lcas467- , whereas the smaller one was lgc358a+/lab759+/lfer466-/lreu986-/lcas467+, indicating that the larger rods are l. fermentum and the smaller ones lactobacilli from the casei group. while the total number of l. casei, streptococci or abiotrophia/granulicatella seemed not to correlate with the extent of disc demineralization, the high concentration of l. fermentum in the biofilm of the extremely demineralized disc  <dig> was quite remarkable.

all other lactobacillus probes gave negative results. concerning lsal <dig> and lvag <dig> we found that both these probes had to be used at much higher stringency conditions  than expected from the in vitro experiments with reference strains to prevent cross-reactivity with other biofilm bacteria. in particular cells with the characteristic morphology of selenomonas were often cross-reactive at conditions of insufficient stringency. abiotrophia and granulicatella could be detected in high numbers in all three samples. both abi <dig> and abi <dig> recognized cocci, which in double-labeling experiments stained always negative with the streptococcal probes lgc358c and mit <dig> . finally, all samples contained high numbers of streptococci, mostly from the mitis group. s. mutans, however, was found with mut <dig> in only one sample at low concentration, and the probes for s. sobrinus and s. constellatus/s. intermedius gave negative results. identification by fish of streptococci, in particular of the mitis group, is hindered severely by high conservation of the 16s rrna gene sequence among these taxa  <cit>  and therefore fish detection of oral streptococci still relies mostly on phylogenic group-specific probes. a surprise finding, confirmed with supragingival plaque samples and scrapings from the dorsum of the tongue, was that both lactococcus probe lcc <dig> and s. constellatus/intermedius probe l-sco/int172- <dig> triggered rather strong fluorescence of long filaments with blunted ends , which could only be suppressed by applying formamide concentrations exceeding 40%. the results were confirmed when probes with exchanged fluorescence labels were used . potential specificity problems associated with phylogenetic group-specific probes are a known phenomenon  <cit> . however, screening of the rdp <dig> database for oral bacteria with this type of morphology and ≤  <dig> sequence mismatches within the gene fragments complementary to these probes, failed to reveal any hints about the possible identity of these filaments. experiments aiming at their isolation by fluorescence activated cell sorting are ongoing.

typing of lactobacillus isolates from in situ grown oral biofilms
with the aim to verify the identification by fish of the lactobacilli present in the three in situ grown biofilm samples , aliquots were cultured on lbs agar. five strains , representing the various colony types observed, were isolated and characterized by both fish and partial sequencing of the 16s rdna . sequence analysis identified two strains as l. fermentum   and two as l. casei/l. paracasei  , based on 100% sequence similarity with respective reference strains. the fifth strain was typed as l. vaginalis   with a sequence match score of  <dig>  to reference strain dox g <dig>  l. vaginalis had not been detected by direct fish analysis of the biofilms , presumably because the cell number was below the detection limit of approximately  <dig> bacteria per ml of sample suspension. tested by fish with the whole set of probes all five isolates showed the anticipated profile . the two l. fermentum isolates were negative to weakly positive with lab <dig> in repeated experiments. this is explained by l. fermentum strains having an adenine at position  <dig> of their 16s rrna, as opposed to a cytosine at the corresponding position of probe lab <dig>  this peripheral mismatch may result sometimes in weak cross-reactivity . in summary, typing by gene sequencing corroborated the data obtained from the direct fish analysis of the in situ grown biofilms.

b scoring of fluorescence intensity is described in a footnote to table  <dig> 

c species identification was based on ≥  <dig> % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with reference strains listed in rdp <dig> . the respective partial 16s rrna gene sequences of omz  <dig> and  <dig> , and of omz  <dig> and  <dig>  were identical. omz  <dig> was identified as l. vaginalis .

critical importance of several assay parameters
lactobacilli are difficult targets for fish because of their cell wall's resistance to probe penetration. the protocol used successfully in the present study to increase cell permeability evolved from the method of harmsen et al.  <cit> , which we supplemented with achromopeptidase, previously described to open cell walls of actinomyces strains  <cit> . systematic evaluation of this three-enzyme-pretreatment with  <dig> reference strains from seven lactobacillus species showed its indispensability. however, a minority of strains proved to be particularly resistant, as up to 20% of the cells recognizable by phase contrast could not be stained. of course this raised concerns that such false-negative results could also affect analyses of clinical samples. we cannot completely rule out this possibility, but after comprehensive analysis of many plaque samples we would like to hypothesize that there are differences in cell wall permeability between cultured and native lactobacilli and that false-negative cells are primarily seen after fish with cultured lactobacilli.

with cell wall permeability remaining a potential reason for concern, maximum fluorescence intensity from penetrated probes is essential. fluorescence intensity depends on cellular ribosome content, in situ probe accessibility to the probe target region, and rrna stability  <cit> . several procedures to maximize the performance of fish probes have been described  <cit> . they alter the 3-dimensional structure of the target region by using helper probes, optimize probe length and hybridization conditions, improve binding affinity by modifying the probes' backbone with lna substitutions, or inhibit enzymatic rrna degradation. in this study we used all four procedures to improve fluorescence intensity of certain probes. for lfer <dig>  lreu <dig>  and lpla <dig> one or two helper probes binding directly adjacent to the target site were added to the hybridization solution and in each case a clear-cut improvement of fluorescence intensity was observed. the same was the case when the lna-substituted probe l-ssob440- <dig> was compared to ssob <dig>  for five other probes the decision to opt for lna insertions was taken solely based on own and published experience  <cit> , suggesting limited accessibility of the probes' target site. all these lna/dna-probes displayed intensive fluorescence, but required strict adherence of very stringent hybridization conditions for sufficient specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have described the application of  <dig> new phylogenetic group- or species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the single-cell detection of oral lab in various clinical or experimental biofilms. the results show that the probes can be used for the rapid identification and quantification of a broad range of lab for both research and diagnostic purposes, provided that restrictions concerning cell permeabilization , hybridization stringency, fluorescence intensity optimization, and use of competitor probes are considered. although designed to cover the diversity of oral lactobacilli, these probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance to gastroenterology, gynecology, heart diseases, food industry, etc. gene sequence typing of isolated strains confirmed the results obtained by analyzing biofilm samples directly by fish. on a speculative note, the apparent correlation between the l. fermentum cell number and the extent of demineralization seen with the three samples from the in situ study could indicate that these bacteria have played a significant role in the carious process. the abundance of l. fermentum might be explained by high resistance to low ph giving these bacteria a selective ecological advantage during the formation of the biofilm.
