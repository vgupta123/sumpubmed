BACKGROUND
one goal of genetic epidemiology is to identify polymorphisms associated with common, complex multifactorial diseases. success in achieving this goal will depend on a research strategy that recognizes and addresses the importance of interactions among multiple genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of diseases such as essential hypertension  <cit> . one traditional approach to modeling the relationship between discrete predictors such as genotypes and discrete clinical outcomes is logistic regression  <cit> . logistic regression is a parametric statistical approach for relating one or more independent or explanatory variables  to a dependent or outcome variable  that follows a binomial distribution. however, as reviewed by moore and williams  <cit> , the number of possible interaction terms grows exponentially as each additional main effect is included in the logistic regression model. thus, logistic regression is limited in its ability to deal with interactions involving many factors. having too many independent variables in relation to the number of observed outcome events is a well-recognized problem  <cit>  and is an example of the curse of dimensionality  <cit> . in response to this limitation, ritchie et al.  <cit>  developed a genetic programming optimized neural network . neural networks are a class of pattern recognition methods developed in the 1940's to model the neuron, the basic functional unit of the brain  <cit> . a major advantage of neural networks in comparison to traditional analysis approaches is their ability to take what is learned on a given dataset about the relationship between independent variables and an outcome variable and make predictions on data where the outcome variable is unknown  <cit> . one disadvantage of neural networks is that the network architecture must be pre-specified and there is no rule of thumb for generating this architecture. thus, trial and error processes often take place  <cit> . gpnn was developed in an attempt to improve upon the trial-and-error process of choosing an optimal architecture for a pure feed-forward back propagation neural network. the gpnn optimizes the inputs from a larger pool of variables, the weights, and the connectivity of the network including the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in the hidden layer. thus, the algorithm attempts to generate optimal neural network architecture for a given data set. this is an advantage over the traditional back propagation nn in which the inputs and architecture are pre-specified and only the weights are optimized.

parkinson's disease  is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by progressive rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia , and postural instability  <cit> . pd affects approximately 2% of the population over the age of  <dig>  increasing to approximately 5% of the population by the age of  <dig>  <cit> . pd is characterized pathologically by widespread neurodegeneration, especially of the dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta. the cause of this neurodegeneration is unknown, but is hypothesized to result from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors affecting energy metabolism and protein turnover. mellick and colleagues previously investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the mitochondrial complex i as potential genetic susceptibility factors for pd. they investigated  <dig> snps in  <dig> nuclear complex i genes in  <dig> pd patients and  <dig> controls. no evidence for a single locus association was identified  <cit> , but a two-factor gene-environment interaction between the dlst gene and sex was detected using multifactor dimensionality reduction   <cit> , another methodology for detecting epistatic interactions.

although previous empirical studies suggest gpnn is a useful method for identifying gene-gene interactions  <cit> , the power of gpnn for high-order gene-gene interaction models is not known and its application to real datasets has not been reported. the goal of the present study was to evaluate the power of gpnn for identifying gene-gene interactions using simulated data representing a variety of epistasis models, and to test this methodology on an actual dataset of snps in mitochondrial complex i nuclear encoded genes in parkinson's disease cases and controls.

RESULTS
the results of the simulation study are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  here, we list the  <dig> epistasis models sorted by allele frequency and number of loci along the vertical axis and heritability across the horizontal axis. table  <dig> shows the results for a sample size of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. table  <dig> shows the results for a sample size of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. table  <dig> shows the results for a sample size of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. for the sample size of  <dig> total individuals, in the two locus models, gpnn had greater than 94% power for all heritability values greater than  <dig> %, greater than 77% for heritability of 1%, and much lower power for the very small genetic effect of  <dig> %. in the three locus models the power of gpnn was greater than 94% in the  <dig> / <dig>  allele frequency models with greater than 2% heritability. however, it was much lower in the  <dig> / <dig>  allele frequency models as well as all heritability values of  <dig> % and lower. in the four and five locus models, the power of gpnn was very low for all heritability values. for the sample size of  <dig> total individuals, in the two locus models, gpnn had greater than 65% power for the epistasis models evaluated at all heritability levels. in the three, four and five locus models, the trend is similar to the smaller sample size. in the total sample size of  <dig> individuals, gpnn has greater than 86% power in the two locus models. again, the three, four, and five locus models showed similar trends. however, in general, the larger number of individuals did increase the power to detect the functional loci.

the results of the real data analysis are shown in table  <dig>  here, we show the gpnn model selected from each cross-validation interval. this includes the factors included in the final model for each interval, as well as the classification error and prediction error of the model. as can be seen in the distribution of factors in the model, dlst_ <dig> and sex are the most commonly detected factors. this two-factor model was selected and used to fit a final gpnn model. this model correctly predicts pd status  <dig> % of the time . the gpnn model that describes this interaction is shown in figure  <dig> 

the results of the stepwise logistic regression  analysis of the pd data are shown in table  <dig>  these results are similar to the gpnn results however, lr selected additional loci. the final lr model included sex, dlst_ <dig>  fa1_ <dig>  and fa10_ <dig>  because the results included additional loci, we implemented a forward selection lr using only the variables identified by gpnn including the interaction term . the results of the forward selection logistic regression using sex, dlst_ <dig>  and the interaction term yielded similar results for dlst and sex, shown in table  <dig>  the interaction term of sex and dlst_ <dig> was not statistically significant.

discussion
identifying disease susceptibility genes associated with common complex, multifactorial diseases is a major challenge for genetic epidemiology. one of the dominating factors in this challenge is the difficulty of detecting gene-gene interactions with currently available statistical approaches. to deal with this issue, new statistical approaches have been developed such as gpnn. gpnn has been shown to have higher power than a back propagation nn using simulated data generated under five two-locus epistasis models  <cit> .

the goal of the current study was to evaluate the power of gpnn for detecting high-order gene-gene interactions using simulated data representing a variety of epistasis models. based on the results shown in table  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  there is an obvious trend in the power to detect the gene-gene interactions in these simulated data. with a sample size of  <dig> individuals , gpnn has high power to detect interactions in two locus models for all heritability values tested with the exception of  <dig> % . as the number of interacting loci increases or the heritability decreases, there is a decrease in the power of gpnn. with a sample size of  <dig> or  <dig> individuals , gpnn has high power to detect interactions in all two locus models evaluated. similar to the trend seen in the sample size of  <dig> individuals, there is a decrease in power as the number of interacting loci increases. there is, however, an increase in power in the data with the larger sample size. we explored the limits of gpnn in terms of genetic effect , sample size, and number of interacting loci. using simulated data models involving two and three locus interactions, we show that gpnn has high power to detect gene-gene interactions in models with very small heritability values  that are well within the range of most common complex diseases in simulated data models. the limits of detection were reached under conditions with very small heritability  or when interactions involved more than three loci. for example, alzheimer's disease is estimated to have heritability between 60â€“75%  <cit>  while breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers are 27%, 35%, and 42% respectively  <cit> . effects as small as those simulated would be very difficult to detect using any method.

secondly, the sample size was held constant at either  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> individuals. these sample sizes may be too small for detection of high-order interaction models. if you consider a two-locus interaction model, there are nine two-locus genotype combinations for the cases and controls to be distributed. when you extend this to a three-locus model, there are  <dig> genotype combinations. this sample of individuals continues to be distributed in the four and five locus models with  <dig> and  <dig> genotype combinations respectively. this demonstrates that the  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> individuals are then distributed much more sparsely across the genotype combinations. this is an example of the curse of dimensionality  <cit> . therefore, to detect gene-gene interactions composed of greater than three loci, the sample size may need to be substantially larger than  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. this is an active area of further study to determine if there is a direct relationship between sample size and number of interacting loci. if a direct relationship exists, this can be used for performing sample size and power calculations for real data analyses rather than performing empirical power studies in the future.

our analysis has revealed an interesting mitochondrial gene-sex interaction leading to altered risk for pd. substantial evidence directly links mitochondrial dysfunction to parkinsonism. for example, mutations in the pink <dig> gene  lead to rare autosomal recessive forms of pd  <cit> . moreover, mitochondrial toxins such as mptp and rotenone can induce parkinsonism in animals and humans  <cit> . in addition, mtdna polymorphisms have also been suggested to influence risk for sporadic pd. the recent study of van der walt and colleagues  <cit>  revealed an association between a non-conservative amino acid changing mtdna snp in the nd <dig> gene and reduced risk for pd. interestingly, this decreased risk appeared to be stronger in women than men. gender differences in the incidence of pd are well documented with men at  <dig>  times greater risk  <cit> . there are many possible reasons for this, including gender specific gene-environment interactions.

our model correctly predicts pd status  <dig> % of the time . because we can only predict ~60% of the individuals' disease status, it is clear that many additional etiological factors are involved. it is important to note that the nature of the effect detected cannot be fully elucidated from this analysis. based on the logistic regression analyses, we confirm that dlst_ <dig> and sex are statistically significant however, the interaction term is not. this could indicate that the effect is not a multiplicative interaction. it could also indicate that logistic regression is underpowered for detecting an interaction of this magnitude in a sample size of approximately  <dig> individuals. biologically, it remains uncertain how the dlst_ <dig> snp-gender interaction, uncovered in the current analysis, might influence risk for pd. the dihydrolipoyl succinyl transferase  gene codes for one of three components of the thiamine-dependent mitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate complex. the dlst_ <dig> snp is located in an intron at the 3' end of the dlst gene and is unlikely to have a biological impact on the function of this gene. because snps across the dlst locus have been shown to exhibit strong linkage disequilibrium however, it is more likely that the dlst_ <dig> snp represents other genetic variability within this locus. further work is required to determine how genetic variation in this locus may influence pd. as is the case for all initial case-control associations, it is important to consider the possibility that this finding is a result of idiosyncrasies in one isolated data set. interestingly, this finding was detected despite a relatively small sample size of approximately  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls. moreover, this interaction was detected using mdr, an independent approach for detecting gene-gene interactions  <cit> . it will be important to replicate this study using other datasets with larger sample sizes or consisting of different populations. nonetheless, our results clearly demonstrate the application of this innovative method to probe for interactive effects in real data sets.

while these results demonstrate the lower limits of gpnn's power to detect gene-gene interactions, there are still many more questions to be addressed. first, it will be important to extend the simulation studies to include larger sample sizes and a larger range of higher heritability values. secondly, while gpnn has good power to detect gene-gene interactions, the robustness of the method in the presence of error has not been evaluated. thus, a simulation study including data with genotyping error, phenocopy, genetic heterogeneity, and missing data may provide more insight into the robustness. finally, a larger set of epistasis models including those with a small degree of main effect as well as a significantly higher number of snps in the study would provide further evidence of the power of gpnn.

since most common diseases have heritability greater than 20%, and gpnn was shown to have 100% power for heritability of 5%  <cit> , gpnn should have high power for detecting interactions in most common diseases. gpnn is likely to be a powerful pattern recognition approach for the detection of gene-gene interactions in future studies of common human disease.

CONCLUSIONS
a genetic programming neural network  is a novel pattern recognition approach for detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in studies of human disease. gpnn has high power to detect two and three-locus interactions in moderate sample sizes. higher order interactions will require larger sample sizes. in addition, gpnn detected a gene-sex interaction associated with parkinson's disease. gpnn, and similar methods, will be useful in dissecting the genetic architecture of common, complex disease.
