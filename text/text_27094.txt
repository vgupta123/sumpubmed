BACKGROUND
social insects  are the exemplars of social life. they are characterized by a reproductive division of labour in which only a few individuals within a colony reproduce , while the large majority helps in raising offspring . this caste system is a result of phenotypic plasticity; i.e. different castes generally arise from environmentally induced differential gene expression  <cit> .

in termites, caste polymorphism is the result of a highly flexible postembryonic development which is especially pronounced in wood-nesting species. here, workers  to become winged sexuals  that disperse from the nest and found their own colony as primary reproductives;  to reproduce in the natal nest as neotenic replacement reproductives when the same-sex reproductive of the colony dies, or  to develop into sterile soldiers that defend the colony . the development into each of these castes requires different numbers of moults; several for alates, one for neotenics and two for soldiers. as an alternative, individuals can remain as workers in the nest by moulting stationarily  or regressively . research in termites so far concentrated on the development of soldiers  <cit> . termite soldiers are a unique caste with no equivalent in other social insects  <cit> . a comparison of differential gene expression between reproductives and workers may, however, allow the identification of common principles and differences in the regulation of reproductive division of labour between social insect taxa.

we specifically addressed the question of what characterizes a queen by comparing gene expression profiles between workers and female reproductives in the drywood termite cryptotermes secundus. in termites, neotenic replacement reproductives are especially suited for this purpose because they differ from workers only by traits linked to reproduction, while confounding traits that are developed by winged sexuals for the dispersal process  are not expressed. our analysis revealed a number of interesting genes that are primarily expressed in neotenic replacement reproductives and may be involved in processes controlling or maintaining the reproductive division of labour.

RESULTS
identification of caste-specific transcripts in female neotenics
the limited publicly available information on genome or cdna sequences of the drywood termite cryptotermes secundus  restricts the number of possible screening techniques for differential gene expression analysis. we chose to compare termite castes using the representational difference analyses of cdna  approach because it is independent of sequence knowledge and requires relatively small amounts of mrna. to identify genes that are specifically expressed in female neotenics, we initially performed a cdna-rda using female neotenics as tester cdna and workers of both sexes as driver cdna. the difference product of the third round was shotgun cloned and  <dig> randomly picked clones were validated using reverse dot blot hybridization with labelled tester and driver cdnas. a representative dot blot hybridisation of representational difference products is shown in figure  <dig>  thirty five out of  <dig> sequenced fragments with highly specific signals in reverse dot blot hybridization were derived from termites and most likely belonged to three independent genes that were named neofem <dig> – neofem <dig>  to identify additional fragments we performed a second rda where we suppressed the seven initially identified, highly overrepresented fragments by adding them in excess to the driver population. additional  <dig> randomly selected clones were picked and analysed as above. sequencing of  <dig> clones revealed  <dig> novel fragments including five fragments that most likely belonged to three different genes . seven sequences were most likely of non-termite origin. mapping of individual fragments was done by a series of inter-fragment pcrs and by 3'- and 5'-race-pcrs, confirming the initial assignment of the identified fragments to six genes. complete transcripts were obtained for two genes , partial 3'- or 5'-sequences were obtained for all other genes. overrepresentation of the putative transferrin cdna  could not be validated by quantitative real-time pcr . physical maps of the remaining five genes indicating the location and number of cloned rda fragments are shown in figure  <dig>  the neofem <dig> gene encodes a putative polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids. its n-terminus comprises a signal peptide suggesting that the neofem <dig> gene product is secreted. a comparative sequence analysis using the blast-x algorithm suggests similarity to genes of the esterase-lipase family, in particular to genes of tribolium castaneum and apis mellifera that are similar to an uncharacterised drosophila gene ortholog. the putative  <dig> amino acid gene product of the neofem <dig> gene also contained a signal peptide. similarity searches identified homologies of the neofem <dig> gene product to members of the glycosyl hydrolase family <dig>  in particular for a beta-glucosidase gene of the termite neotermes koshuensis  <cit>  and a male-specific β-glycosidase of the madeira cockroach leucophaea maderae  <cit> . the partial sequence of neofem <dig> showed the highest sequence similarity to the vitellogenin  <dig> precursor  sequence of the american cockroach periplaneta americana  <cit>  which serves as a precursor of egg-yolk proteins. the putative neofem <dig> gene product is closely related to family  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> enzymes  from arthropods, with highest similarities to cyp4u <dig> from the australian termite coptotermes acinaciformis  and to cyp4c <dig> of blaberus discoidalis  <cit> . no homologies were found for the neofem <dig> gene fragment. table  <dig> summarizes the sequence analysis of all these genes. complete nucleotide sequences were submitted to genbank .

quantitative expression analysis of the neofem1– <dig> genes
to validate and further analyse the expression of neofem1– <dig> genes, we performed qrt-pcr using rna-samples derived from different termite castes . to be able to normalize the expression data, we initially cloned gene fragments of putative house keeping genes  and designed primers for qrt-pcr. the suitability of putative reference genes was evaluated by using the bestkeeper software  <cit> . the comparison revealed that 18s rrna was the most stable reference gene . figure  <dig> shows relative expression levels of the five neofem genes that met the selection criteria of the initial rda – their expression was generally much higher in female neotenics as compared with workers. in line with the order of appearance and the fragment abundance in the initial rdas, expression levels of the neofem <dig> – neofem <dig> genes in female neotenics were up to four orders of magnitude higher in female neotenics than in workers. as expected, the difference in gene expression was less pronounced in the two genes identified exclusively in the second rda . while neofem <dig>  and neofem <dig>  genes were almost exclusively expressed in female reproductives , the gene homologous to vitellogenin  was expressed in all reproductives. expression of the p <dig> homolog  was highest in female neotenics. the unknown transcript  was detected in all castes and showed highest expression in females.

to determine, where the five neotenic-specific genes are expressed in female neotenics, total rna was prepared from different body parts  and was analysed by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  four of the five genes were expressed primarily in the termite head. the gene neofem <dig> was detected almost equally in all three body parts.

discussion
the ability of cryptotermes secundus workers to develop into neotenic replacement reproductives after a single moult offers the unique possibility to study differential gene expression during caste differentiation. in this study, we compared the transcriptomes from female neotenics and workers of both gender using rda to identify novel neotenics-specific transcripts.

we were able to identify five genes that were highly overrepresented in female neotenics of the drywood termite c. secundus. four of these five genes were overexpressed in the head. expression of the genes neofem <dig> and neofem <dig> of c. secundus was highly specific for female reproductives. both genes are predicted to encode secretory proteins that are specifically expressed in the heads of female neotenics. the open reading frame of neofem <dig> encodes a putative esterase-lipase which shows the highest similarity to yet uncharacterized proteins of the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum and the honey bee apis mellifera which are putative orthologs of the drosophila protein cg4382-pa. in addition, two juvenile hormone esterases  of the mosquito aedes aegypti are closely related to the neofem <dig> protein sequence. most interestingly, the apis mellifera homolog  was found in the brain of adult female worker honey bees  <cit>  and is closely related to a moth integumental carboxyl/cholinesterase which is implicated in pheromone processing  <cit> .

neofem <dig> showed highest similarity to a digestive β-glycosidase from the salivary glands of the termite neotermes koshuensis  <cit> . insect glycosidases are known to include, amongst others, digestive and pheromone degrading enzymes  <cit> . however, the lack of expression in males suggests a sex specific function. thus neofem <dig> is presumably not a digestive enzyme. rather the close match to lma-p <dig> protein of the madeiran cockroach  <cit> , which is sex specifically expressed in the abdominal glands of male cockroaches to attract females, may indicate a pheromonal function.

the c. secundus neofem <dig> protein is closely related to family  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> enzymes  from arthropods, with highest similarities to an uncharacterized termite cyp <dig> from coptotermes acinaciformes and to cypivc <dig> from blaberus discoidalis . cytochrome p <dig> enzymes of insects are generally associated with the metabolism of endogenous substrates or hormones, and with detoxification . in termites and social hymenoptera, some cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are expressed in a caste specific manner  <cit> . contrary to these studies on hymenoptera and on coptotermes acinaciformes that all revealed highest expression levels in non-reproducing castes, neofem <dig> of c. secundus was overexpressed specifically in female neotenics. in termites, cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are involved in metabolic pathways  or insecticide resistance   <cit> . however, the specific expression of neofem <dig> in the head of female neotenics suggests that neofem <dig> is involved in the metabolism of endogenous substrates like ecdysteroids or jh rather than insecticide resistance.

the gene neofem <dig> is the only gene that is distributed almost equally in all body parts of female neotenics. it showed highest similarities to insect vitellogenins , specifically to vg <dig> of the american cockroach periplaneta americana and a vg of the turnip sawfly athalia rosae. in most insect species vitellogenins are synthesized extraovarially in female fat body cells as large precursor proteins of vitellin . vgs are secreted into the haemolymph and then incorporated into developing oocytes  <cit> . high expression levels of vg in female reproductives  were expected because of their ovarian activity. the elevated vg expression in male reproductives may be explained by the function of vgs as storage proteins  <cit> . recently it was shown that functionally sterile nursing honey bee workers utilize vitellogenin to produce royal jelly to feed larvae  <cit> . the above findings suggest that an ancestral reproductive protein, vg, was repeatedly co-opted in different social species to serve different functions in different castes. thus, vg seems to function as an important developmental protein.

CONCLUSIONS
we isolated and characterized five genes that were up-regulated in female replacement reproductives compared to non-reproducing workers of the drywood termite cryptotermes secundus . interestingly, potential homologues of some of these genes appear to be expressed in different insect species, hemimetabolous as well as holometabolous, in a caste- and species-specific manner. especially, pheromone-processing genes and vg emerge as major players that were repeatedly exploited in social evolution of insect societies.
