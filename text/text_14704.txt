BACKGROUND
plants adapted for pollination by hummingbirds possess a syndrome of correlated traits, namely abundant sucrose-rich nectar, scentless, often brightly colored flowers, no landing platform, and stigmas and stamens placed such that foraging hummingbirds effect cross-pollination . at least 84 % of hummingbird nectar flowers are red  <cit> . the required correlated trait changes have originated many times, and from alaska to tierra del fuego, some  <dig> species in  <dig> genera from  <dig> families now depend on one or more of the  <dig> species of hummingbirds for their pollination  <cit> . in western north america alone, bird pollination is thought to have arisen over  <dig> times  <cit> , although the basis for this estimate is unclear. inferring how fast and how often plant lineages became specialized for hummingbird pollination by acquiring ‘pro bird’ and ‘anti bee’ traits  <cit> , requires clock-dated phylogenies for hummingbirds and the plant lineages adapted to them. two studies have taken this approach. the first focused on the neotropical acanthaceae genus ruellia, which has  <dig> species, half of them adapted for pollination by hummingbirds  <cit> . hummingbirds evolved in the late oligocene  <cit>  long before new world ruellia, which originated  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya. this mismatch led tripp and mcdade  <cit>  to suggest that ruellia diversification was facilitated by a pre-existing diversity of hummingbirds. the second study focused on a section of passiflora with 62– <dig> species, ~90 % of them pollinated by hummingbirds, especially the sword-billed hummingbird, ensifera ensifera  <cit> . the passiflora clade has a similar age as e. ensifera, namely ca.  <dig> my, and its diversification apparently resulted from rapid evolution in small isolated populations in the high andes  <cit> .

here, we compare the diversity build-up in hummingbird/plant assemblages in north america  and temperate south america , focusing on plants morphologically adapted for hummingbird pollination. we chose these two regions because of the tractable numbers of bird and plant species involved, available data on which bird species pollinate which plant species, and their ecological comparability, yet evolutionary independence. as the basis for our study, we compiled lists of both the bird-adapted plant species and the hummingbird species in both regions. north america has  <dig> species of hummingbirds  of which eight belong to the bee hummingbirds and are almost endemic in north america. temperate south america has six species of hummingbirds, one  barely extending its range from the tropics into the temperate climate . there is no overlap in the native hummingbirds or the native plant species or genera between north america and temperate south america.fig.  <dig> tanglegrams for north american hummingbird species with plant species adapted for bird pollination ; a: map of north america , central america , and the caribbean ; b: schematic depiction of  <dig> of the  <dig> dated north american hummingbird-pollinated clades . red lines indicate hummingbird-pollinated species, red triangles hummingbird-pollinated plant clades . stem ages and crown ages except for campsis  for which no stem age is provided in the original publication; c: selasphorus rufas at ipomopsis aggregata , photo by m. manske, oregon department of transportation, www.wikipedia.org; d: dated phylogeny and ancestral area reconstruction for bee hummingbirds and mountain gems. north american species and lineages are indicated with blue lines, central american species/lineages with orange, caribbean species with lilac, and hummingbird lineages from other regions with black lines. orange-blue dashed lines for calothorax lucifer, eugenes fulgens, and selasphorus platycercus indicate that these species occur in central and north america. error margins on plant time estimates are shown in table  <dig>  those for birds in tables s <dig>  time scales below figures are in million years before present

we expected the oldest north american bird/plant pollination mutualisms to be younger than the oldest south american ones because the north american birds appear to be younger. this is apparent from a molecular clock-dated hummingbird phylogeny that includes  <dig> species  <cit>  and which indicates that the crown age of the bee hummingbird clade to which most of the north american hummingbirds belong is just  <dig>  ma old. the temperate south american bird species, by contrast, have older divergence times, up to  <dig>  my  <cit> . nevertheless, old pollinator groups can pollinate young plant groups, and old plant clades can have young pollinators . our comparative investigation at the species or  genus level differs from previous analyses, such as the above-mentioned study by tripp and mcdade  <cit>  because we consider specific interacting plant and hummingbird species, using tanglegrams.

the main questions we wanted to answer were:  in each of the two biogeographic regions, are the oldest hummingbird species or clades and the oldest plant species or clades that depend on bird pollination of the same age?  if so, is the entire north american bird/plant assemblage indeed younger than the temperate south american assemblage as expected from the younger ages of the north american birds or is there a temporal disconnect between bird and plant crown ages as in the case of ruellia? and  was the build-up of bird/plant mutualisms in the two regions gradual or instead temporarily clustered?

material and methods
plant taxon sampling and sequence alignment
we compiled all temperate north and south american plant species reported as pollinated by hummingbirds and/or showing morphological and physiological adaptations to hummingbird pollination, such as:  brightly colored, scentless flowers, with  long, often quite stiff corolla tubes,  exposed stigmas and stamens,  large amounts of sucrose-rich nectar, and  semi-pendent exposed position, and  no landing platform  <cit> . plant species occasionally visited by hummingbirds, but mainly pollinated by insects were not included.

for three clades , we used published divergence time estimates , while for  <dig> others we downloaded and modified or newly compiled alignments from genbank  or treebase . for north america, we used alignments that included bird-pollinated species of castilleja  from  <cit> ; keckiella , modified from  <cit> ; monarda , newly built; ipomopsis and collomia  from  <cit> ; and ribes  from  <cit> . for temperate south america, we used alignments that included species of campsidium  modified from  <cit> ; vestia  from  <cit> ; dendroseris  from  <cit> ; puya  from  <cit> ; rhaphithamnus  modified from  <cit> ; schizanthus  modified from  <cit> ; latua  modified from  <cit> ; and tristerix  from  <cit> . the taxonomic composition of each alignment, gene regions used, and alignment lengths are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig>  which also shows the genbank accession numbers of species added to some of the alignments.

plant clock models, their calibration and cross validation
molecular clock dating of the  <dig> matrices relied on beast version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , with strict and relaxed clock models applied to each matrix. relaxed clock models were preferred if the ucld.stdev value in tracer version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was ≥ <dig>  . all markov chain monte carlo  runs employed a yule tree prior and the gtr + g substitution model with four rate categories . mcmc chains were run for  <dig> million generations, sampling every  <dig> th generation, unless stated otherwise in table s <dig>  of the posterior trees, we dropped the first 20 % as burn-in and then checked convergence, using tracer, making sure that all effective sample sizes  were > <dig>  ess values indicate the number of effectively independent draws from the posterior in the sample, and this statistic can help to identify autocorrelation and poor mixing. tree annotator  was then used to create maximum clade credibility trees. trees were visualized, edited and rooted in fig tree  <cit> . error bars  are only shown for nodes having a posterior probability ≥ 98 %.

for calibration we used a range of published nuclear or plastid substitution rates or  secondary calibrations from other studies with taxonomically overlapping nodes as listed for each matrix in table s <dig>  we validated each calibration by comparing the age of at least one node in each of our chronograms with the age of the same node in published fossil-calibrated chronograms, such as the angiosperm-wide study of bell et al.  <cit>  or other studies as listed in table s <dig> 

bird taxon sampling and sequence alignment
our alignment comprised five species of swifts and  <dig> species of hummingbirds of which  <dig> came from the alignment of mcguire et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> were downloaded from genbank ,  <dig> were provided by mcguire , and three  came from  <cit> . the  <dig> hummingbird species that occur in north america  are all in the matrix, but of the temperate south american species we lack oreotrochilus leucopleurus, one of six species in this genus, three of them included in the matrix. the mitochondrial and nuclear regions used in the bird alignment are listed in table s <dig>  which also gives the genbank accession numbers of the downloaded sequences added to the alignment using the mesquite software  <cit> . the concatenated final matrix had  <dig> aligned positions and  <dig>  % empty cells. the matrix and a maximum likelihood tree have been submitted to treebase .

bird clock models, their calibration and cross validation
molecular clock dating of the hummingbird matrix relied on beast with the same basic strategy as used for the plant dating. modeltest  gave the gtr + g substitution model, followed by the hky + g model, as best fitting the mitochondrial data . the best-fitting model for the nuclear matrix of  <dig> aligned nucleotides, excluding empty cells , was the k2p + g model. for the combined matrix  we chose a substitution model of intermediate complexity, namely the hky + g model. a relaxed clock model fit the combined data less well than a strict clock . we therefore used a strict clock model, and calibrated it with a hummingbird stem group fossil from the oil shale of messel in southern germany that provides a minimum age for the divergence between hummingbirds and swifts  <cit> . argon dating of igneous rocks underlying the messel pit indicates a lower lutetian age of approximately  <dig>  my  <cit> , which has been used for fossils from this pit. we used a gamma distribution with an off-set at  <dig>  my, a shape parameter of  <dig> , and a median of  <dig> , allowing 95 % of the ages to fall between  <dig>  and  <dig>  my, and  <dig>  % to be older than  <dig>  my . this encompasses the stem age of  <dig>  my obtained by bleiweiss  <cit> .

as an alternative to the fossil calibration, we used an uncorrelated lognormal  relaxed clock  and calibrated it using a mean mitochondrial substitution rate of  <dig>  substitutions/site/year x 10− <dig>  which has been calculated for hummingbirds using geographic and habitat-age calibrations  <cit> . this rate is in line with the general bird mitochondrial substitution rate of 2 % . for the nuclear sequences, beast calculated a rate of  <dig>  substitutions/site/year x 10− <dig> . this fits with nuclear rates in animals being considerably slower than mitochondrial rates  <cit> .

pollinator state reconstructions
species were coded as hummingbird pollinated based on the data cited in our own lists  or as pollinated by bees, flies, butterflies or moths based on relevant studies e.g.,  <cit> . in a few cases, pollination mode was inferred from flower color, flower size and orientation, corolla tube length, and the time when flowers are open . we then used the plant chronograms to infer the origin of hummingbird pollination using ancestral state reconstruction under maximum likelihood optimization in bayestraits  <dig>   <cit>  or under parsimony optimization in mesquite  <dig>   <cit> . most nodes that we accepted as hummingbird pollinated had probabilities of >70 % for that state; aquilegia and lonicera had values between  <dig> and 70 %.

biogeographic analyses
this study focuses on hummingbirds and plants in north america north of 24°n  and in temperate south america south of the atacama desert . these latitudes represent the border between the temperate and the subtropical habitats where many tropical species reach their northern- or southernmost distribution. after excluding four of the five swift outgroup species, each hummingbird species was assigned to one of the following biogeographic regions: north america, temperate south america, central america, west indies, tropical south american lowlands, and northern andes, based on schuchmann  <cit>  and williamson  <cit> . ancestral area reconstruction relied on bayesian binary mcmc analysis as implemented in rasp  <dig> beta  <cit> . as input trees, we used  <dig>  trees from the fossil-calibrated beast run and deleted all outgroup species except for streptoprocne zonalis. we used  <dig>  iterations, sampling every 100th, with the jukes-cantor + g model of state transitions. streptoprocne zonalis was assigned as outgroup using the “custom” option. all switches between areas and area combinations were allowed except that we permitted maximally two areas for the root node because a larger ancestral range seemed implausible. we only report inferred ancestral areas for north america and temperate south america and only those that had likelihoods ≥75 %.

RESULTS

we were able to infer divergence times for  <dig> of the c.  <dig> independent north american hummingbird-adapted species/clades, and together they include  <dig> of the  <dig> hummingbird-adapted species . for temperate south america, we were able to infer divergence times for  <dig> of the c.  <dig> independent origins of bird pollination, and together they include  <dig> of the  <dig> hummingbird-adapted species . figures  <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the temporal build-up for  <dig> of the  <dig> north american species/clades and for the  <dig> temperate south american species/clades, along with the divergence times of the birds that pollinate them. for six of the north american plants we had no information on the specific hummingbird species pollinating them , and they could therefore not be included in the tanglegram.

the oldest north american hummingbird-adapted plants in our sample are the lonicera clade  and the lithospermum notatum species group . the oldest temperate south american hummingbird-adapted group in our sample is a chilean gesneriaceae clade of three species . the youngest north american hummingbird-pollinated species in our sample is monarda didyma , and the youngest temperate south american hummingbird adapted clade is puya venusta .

our hummingbird chronogram  is similar to a chronogram from largely overlapping dna data  <cit> . the ages inferred with the two calibrations differ little even for the hummingbird crown age , which is  <dig>  my using the fossil calibration or  <dig>  my using the rate calibration. outside evidence supporting these dating efforts comes from several sources .

in the fossil-calibrated chronogram, the north american bee hummingbird radiation has a stem age of  <dig>  my and a crown group age of  <dig>  my . the emeralds and mountain gems whose ranges extend from central america into northern mexico, arizona and texas  have similar ages as the north american bee hummingbirds. however, the mountain gem, eugenes fulgens, ranging from costa rica to southern arizona, is older, dating to about  <dig>  my . the temperate south american species, sephanoides sephaniodes and s. fernandensis form a clade that has a stem age of  <dig>  my and a crown age of  <dig>  my . the other three species in temperate south america, patagona gigas, sappho sparganura and oreotrochilus leucopleurus, are not closely related to each other. they are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  my old , is  <dig>  my old .

the  <dig> my crown age and  <dig>  my stem age of the oldest north american food-plant clade, lonicera, more or less matches the age of eugenes fulgens  and the stem age of the north american bee hummingbird clade,  <dig>  my. similarly, the  <dig>  my crown age of the oldest temperate south american food-plant clade more or less matches the stem ages of the genera sephanoides,  <dig>  my, and patagona,  <dig>  my .

the origin of the diversity asymmetry between bird species and bird-pollinated plant species
in north america, eight of the ~ <dig> transitions to hummingbirds as pollinators  comprise five or more species . we here dated  <dig> of these  <dig> transitions with together  <dig> species , with our sampling including the largest bird-pollinated genus, castilleja, as well as some of single-species transitions to bird pollination. in temperate south america, none of the ~ <dig> transitions to hummingbird pollination has resulted in a clade with > <dig> species; the three genera with at least four hummingbird-pollinated species are greigia, lobelia, and tristerix . we dated  <dig> of the  <dig> transitions to hummingbird pollination with together  <dig> species . as shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  the diversity build-up appears to have been gradual. species numbers in  <dig> sister taxon pairs, with one member pollinated by hummingbirds, the other not , do not suggest a consistent positive effect of hummingbird pollination on diversification.

discussion
the main questions we wanted to answer concerned the timeframe of the bird/plant pollination mutualisms in north america and temperate south america, namely do the oldest plant species/clades and bird species/clades match in age? and was the build-up of bird/plant mutualisms in the two regions gradual or did it instead involve temporarily clustered radiations. our results reveal that in each of the two regions, the oldest interacting clades are indeed of matching age, at least within the error of molecular clock dating and given our incomplete species sampling, but the north american bird/plant assemblage is roughly half as old as the temperate south american one, yet has more than 3x as many bird-pollinated plant species. the diversity build-up in both regions was gradual, rather than occurring in clustered radiations . the oldest temperate south american species are patagona gigas and the genus sephanoides, both perhaps  <dig> my old and thus much older than the bee hummingbird clade in north america . other species that pollinate north american plants, such as a few emeralds and mountain gems have low abundances in north america, and several of them have only extended their ranges northwards during the last 100 years  <cit> . the younger age of the north american assemblage may be the footprint of more pronounced pleistocene extinctions in that region.

our study provides the fourth independent molecular-clock dating of hummingbird divergence times, and we used both fossil calibration and rate calibration. the crown group age we inferred with either calibration  is slightly older than the  <dig> my inferred by bleiweiss  <cit>  from dna melting temperatures and a  <dig> species matrix, the  <dig> my inferred by jetz et al.  <cit>  from a phylogenetic tree that included  <dig>  bird species,  <dig> of them hummingbirds, or the  <dig>  my  from a tree that included  <dig> hummingbird taxa  calibrated with substitution rates of hawaiian honeycreepers  <cit> . tripp and mcdade  <cit> , similar to us, calibrated the mcguire et al.  <cit>  matrix with a fossil-based constraint at the swift/hummingbird split, but assigned the stem-group hummingbird fossil used for calibration to the crown node of hummingbirds. in our fossil-calibrated chronogram, the divergence between sephanoides fernandensis, the only hummingbird endemic to the juan fernandez islands , and its southern andean sister species sephanoides sephaniodes  <cit>  is dated to  <dig>  my, which agrees well with the age of  <dig>  my of oldest island of the juan fernandez archipelago  <cit> , the archipelago in which sephanoides fernandensis is endemic.

the list of north american hummingbird-adapted species compiled for this study  includes 50– <dig> more species than previous compilations, namely grant’s  <cit>  list of  <dig> hummingbird-adapted species in western north america and williamson’s  <cit>  list of  <dig> species for all of north america. we estimate some  <dig> transitions to hummingbird pollination, including ten in penstemon alone  <cit> , while a previous estimate was  <dig> independent transitions  <cit> . the latter number implies  <dig> more gains and losses of hummingbird pollination, perhaps mostly in poorly sampled groups, such as castilleja or penstemon. from our species lists , it can be seen that the north american bird-pollinated flora is dominated by temperate herbaceous lineages, such as aquilegia, castilleja, penstemon, and silene, while the south america bird-pollinated flora is dominated by species from semi-woody tropical andean clades . in both regions, however, the diversity build-up on the plant side appears to have been gradual, with individual species adapting to hummingbirds in < < <dig>  ma and many co-occurring species ‘serviced’ by the same bird species .

our study provides an absolute time frame for these two asymmetric build-ups of animal/plant assemblages . in each region, some hummingbird species co-occur and feed on the same plant species, which is the situation described by janzen as diffuse coevolution, defined as an array of interacting populations or species generating “a selective pressure as a group” . one-to-one interactions, however, also exist in both regions, for example, between castilleja coccinea  and archilochus colubris, the only hummingbird species occurring in eastern north america  <cit>  and between the chilean gesneriaceae asteranthera ovata, mitraria coccinea, sarmienta repens) and sephanoides sephaniodes in central and southern patagonia .

for north america, we inferred  <dig> instances of hummingbird pollination evolving within clades with bee pollination , but only in castilleja did this switch lead to subsequent diversification of a hummingbird-pollinated clade. usually, related hummingbird-pollinated species, such as silene virginica, s. regia, and s. rotundifolia , occur in different habitats but share the same pollinator . in temperate south america, switching from insects to birds happened at least  <dig> times. these results show that while hummingbirds have contributed to plant diversification, once a species is hummingbird-pollinated, further speciation is rare, perhaps because of the extensive gene flow mediated by these strong-flying pollinations. that hummingbird pollination per se is not a diversifying factor is also implied by our tabulation of  <dig> sister clades with and without hummingbird pollination . grant and grant  <cit>  hypothesized that the reason for the limited diversification in hummingbird-adapted plants in north america might be the young age of these mutualisms. however, this is unlikely to be the sole explanation since the much older temperate south american hummingbird-dependent plants are similarly species-poor. instead, hummingbird pollination in temperate regions may slow down population fragmentation and geographically small-scale speciation because these vertebrate pollinators maintain across-population gene flow.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides absolute time frames for the build-up of hummingbird/plant mutualisms in north america and temperate south america, and these time frames turn out to differ greatly. in both regions, plant groups successively entered the new adaptive zone ‘hummingbird pollination,’ but this mode of pollination then did not lead to rapid further speciation . temperate-region mutualisms involving nectar-feeding and migrating vertebrates are unlikely to involve one-to-one coevolution because no temperate zone hummingbird species can afford to completely rely on a single plant species for their nectar. this is also implied by our tanglegrams, incomplete as they are.
