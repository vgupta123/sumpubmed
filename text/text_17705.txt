BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is a non-motile, rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium belonging to the enterobacteriaceae family. it occupies diverse ecological niches ranging from soil to water, but from an anthropocentric perspective it represents one of the most important human pathogens  <cit> . k. pneumoniae are commonly reported as etiologic agents of either community-acquired urinary tract infections or bacterial pneumonia. however, it can cause any type of infection in hospital settings, including outbreaks in newborns and adults under intensive care, which is likely associated to its ability to spread rapidly in the hospital environment  <cit> .

a wide repertoire of virulence and resistance factors is present in k. pneumoniae genomes, allowing for the expression of capsule, siderophores, adhesins and antimicrobial resistance determinants  <cit> .

at present, six complete k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae genomes are available on the public databases, namely k. pneumoniae strains mgh  <dig> , ntuh-k <dig> -positive isolate obtained from a patient with liver abscess and meningitis  <cit> ),  <dig> , hs <dig> , kctc  <dig>  and  <dig> . other  <dig> on-going k. pneumoniae sequencing projects are available as scaffolds/contigs at the ncbi genome database . the availability of closed genomes is important towards understanding the k. pneumoniae genome plasticity and the evolutionary forces that drive their genetic differentiation and occupation of distinct ecological niches. for instance, wu et al.  <cit>  showed that the methionine salvage pathway, which might have a role in pathogenesis via oxidative stress, is present in all klebsiella genomes but not in escherichia, salmonella or shigella, thus providing diversity in virulence mechanisms in pathogenic enterobacteria. moreover, from the comparative genomic analyses between strains  <dig> and mgh  <dig>  fouts et al.  <cit>  identified variations in the distribution of genes related to surface attachment, regulation and signaling, secretion and transport, all of which may have important implications concerning their preferred lifestyle and host ranges .

among the antimicrobial resistance repertoire of k. pneumoniae, the production of carbapenemase is particularly worrisome since it confers resistance to all beta-lactams. kpc  is the main ambler’s class a carbapenemase found in this species, representing an emerging public health issue in many countries like usa, greece, israel, and brazil  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown that the worldwide dissemination of kpc-producing k.pneumoniae occurred due to the expansion of ancestrally-related isolates comprising the clonal complex  <dig> . even though representatives of kpc producing cc <dig> have also successfully disseminated in brazil, many kpc- <dig> producers reported in that country are not related to this epidemic lineage  <cit> .

in may  <dig>  k. pneumoniae isolate kp <dig>  was obtained from the blood culture of a patient admitted to the intensive care unit  of a teaching hospital located in the city of londrina, southern brazil. kp <dig> was one of the representative strains of a clone that caused a nosocomial outbreak in that hospital that involved  <dig> icu patients. it was the first time kpc producers were identified in that healthcare institution. of notice, nearly 60% of cases died in average within  <dig> days after kpc-producing k. pneumoniae isolate was recovered. although this outbreak was due to the clonal dissemination of kpc-producing isolates, kp <dig> showed a distinguished antimicrobial susceptibility profile, expressively more resistant than the other isolates .

in addition, it was previously reported that kp <dig> possesses a unique capsular gene cluster, cpskp <dig>  among the approximately  <dig> capsular serotypes described to date  <cit> . the genome of kp <dig> was fully sequenced and showed to be constituted by one chromosome and six plasmids. to our best knowledge, it represents the first available complete and closed genome of a k. pneumoniae isolated from latin america, as well as the first one of a k. pneumoniae responsible for causing a large nosocomial outbreak.

in this report, we perform a genomic comparison between kp <dig> and three k. pneumoniae genomes , to gain insights into the resistance and virulence repertoire of this strain, its unique/shared gene content relative to the compared strains and plasticity regions that may be circulating in other clinically relevant bacteria.

RESULTS
general genomic features of k. pneumoniae isolate kp13
mlst analysis classified kp <dig> under the st  <dig>  sharing a single alelle with both st  <dig> and st  <dig>  the main clusters associated with the worldwide dissemination of kpc-producing k. pneumoniae. of notice, clinical isolates belonging to st  <dig> have been only identified in brazil so far  <cit> .

the complete genome of k. pneumoniae isolate kp <dig> consists of  <dig> ,888 bp of which  <dig> ,003 bp form a single, circular chromosome  and  <dig>  bp are split into six plasmids which range in size from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp  . all the replicons were completely closed and the putative coding sequences  were manually validated. the reported sequence data can be obtained from the ncbi  under project accession id prjna <dig>

kp <dig> genome compared to related bacteria

‡number of cdss according to the submitted genbank flatfile downloaded from ncbi for each studied genome.

the g + c content of the kp <dig> chromosome is  <dig> %, which is in agreement with values previously reported for ntuh-k <dig> , mgh  <dig>  and  <dig>  . however, the plasmidial sequences present a much lower g + c content of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  suggesting the existence of dna acquired during events of horizontal gene transfer , an observation that is corroborated by the number of mobile genetic elements  such as transposons and phage sequences found in these plasmids. the number of transfer rnas  identified in kp <dig> was  <dig>  which is identical to those of mgh  <dig> and ntuh-k <dig>  but different than that reported in the strain  <dig> that carries  <dig> trnas genes . regarding the chromosome size, kp <dig> lies between the human pathogens ntuh-k <dig> and mgh  <dig>  <cit> , while k. pneumoniae  <dig> presents the largest chromosome size . this is probably due to the accumulation of genes related to its adaptation to a different ecological niche since this strain is a n2-fixing bacterium  <cit> . however, when considering only plasmidial sequences, the dna content of kp <dig>  is markedly higher than other compared strains being followed by mgh  <dig> . in fact, as it will be further discussed in this paper, a number of kp13’s virulence- and resistance-related genes are plasmid-mediated and their respective proteins may contribute for evasion of host defenses and survival under antimicrobial selective pressure.

comparison of the chromosomal architecture between k. pneumoniae
the overall architecture of the chromosomes of k. pneumoniae kp <dig>  ntuh-k <dig>  mgh  <dig> and  <dig> were studied using the mauve tool  <cit> , and these multiple alignments are shown in additional file  <dig>  this analysis evidenced an overall structural conservation and colinearity among the chromosomes of the different k. pneumoniae strains compared. the multiple alignments showed the existence of nine large locally colinear blocks ; however, it was observed that strain-specific regions were also present within lcbs , which may harbor specific adaptations of each bacterium, as it will be further discussed in the plasticity segment section. these regions most likely represent dna acquired during events of hgt and may provide a greater metabolic versatility to kp <dig> strain  <cit> . for instance, the chromosome of n2-fixing strain  <dig> was the one that most accumulated differences relative to other human pathogens , such as the nif cluster located in a plasticity region unique to that strain   <cit> .

chromosomal inversions are thought to be one of the main events of genomic rearrangements in bacteria  <cit> . of notice, no recombination events leading to inversions of dna segments occurred within the larger lcbs . only lcb <dig> and lcb <dig>  were found inverted relative to the kp <dig> chromosome . this observation reinforces the conserved chromosomal architecture among the compared k. pneumoniae strains since these strains are not epidemiologycally related and, in the case of  <dig>  can be considered ecologically distinct from one another.

regions of genomic plasticity between kp <dig> and other k. pneumoniae
a total of  <dig> rgps were identified in kp13’s chromosome when compared to the chromosomes of  <dig>  mgh  <dig> and ntuh-k <dig> . most of these regions contain sequences related to transposable elements, and were flanked by genes coding for trnas or phage-structures , which can be regarded as evidences for their horizontal acquisition  <cit> . the amount of dna located in these regions accounts for at least  <dig>  kbp or  <dig> % of the kp <dig> chromosome. the main characteristics of these rgps are next discussed, but additional information is provided as supporting information .

kp <dig> chromosome

*blastn performed against the ‘nr’ database at the ncbi website; dgc%, deviation from mean chromosomal gc content; s.b., synteny break from at least one other compared k. pneumoniae; phage, probable bacteriophage region; trna, presence of flanking transfer rnas; transposases, presence of transposase-related sequences; t4ss/t6ss, presence of, respectively, types iv/vi secretion systems.

rgp <dig> carries an insertion sequence at its 5′-end  and harbors cdss with predicted catalytic domains at the protein level including two possible dioxygenases  and a dehydrogenase , which may be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds  <cit> , although further studies will be necessary to confirm this role. rgp <dig> contains genes for transposases and a possible phage integrase  as well as hypothetical genes which do not allow for any inference on a possible metabolic role. rgp <dig> is  <dig> kbp in length and represents a phage insertion in the kp <dig> chromosome, with the majority of its cdss sharing greater identity to those of salmonella phage spn1s . a second, large bacteriophage-related rgp was detected in the kp <dig> chromosome  and part of this region exhibits remarkable sequence similarity to that of k. oxytoca ϕko <dig> prophage  <cit> . apart from phage sequences, a possible antibiotic resistance cluster that contains genes coding for transcriptional regulators , an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase  and a glyoxalase/bleomicin dioxygenase  were found, but further experimental studies are warranted to establish the relevance of this region to the mdr phenotype displayed by kp <dig>  rgp <dig> is one of three plasticity segments containing genes responsible for type vi secretion system  formation. t6ss proteins are part of a recently described apparatus that secretes toxins using a needle-like mechanism  <cit> . they have been previously implicated in bacterial pathogenesis such as the hsi-i locus of pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with persistent infections by this bacteria  <cit> . a cds coding for the vgrg protein was identified in rgp <dig> . this protein may play both the role of an effector  as well as of structural component of the t6ss where it has been reported to form part of the puncturing needle  <cit> . two other t6ss-related rgps were detected in the kp <dig> chromosome inside of the rgp <dig> and rgp <dig>  rgp <dig> contains cdss coding for bacteriocins, proteins that target other bacteria and may provide competitive advantage to kp <dig>  in contrast, the third t6ss locus found in rgp <dig> harbors the hcp gene  whose product, hcp, is also part of the needle structure along with vgrg  <cit> . it has been shown that hcp inhibited phagocytosis by macrophages in aeromonas hydrophila, thus acting as an effector in modulating the host’s innate immune response  <cit> . a noteworthy plasticity region detected in the kp <dig> chromosome was located in rgp <dig> , which has been previously established in other bacteria as being an ice   <cit> . the integration of this region into the kp <dig> chromosome could have been facilitated by trnas  located at its flanking termini as has been shown for other k. pneumoniae <cit> . genes usually involved in plasmidial mobilization  as well as in t4ss  are also present and could have aided in the mobilization of this region . a great part of the gene composition of rgp <dig> is related to that of yersinia pestis high-pathogenicity island  which is present in many enterobacteriaceae genera  <cit> . the presence of genes coding for the yersiniabactin siderophores  are characteristic of this hpi, and their occurrence in more virulent k. pneumoniae strains has been previously reported  <cit> . the presence of this region is indicative that kp <dig> is well adapted as a pathogen, since iron scavenging is important during infection, as this nutrient is poorly available in the host in its free form. alternative siderophore systems were also found in the kp <dig> genome and will be further detailed. the ice region is absent in the clinical strain mgh  <dig> as well as in the n2-fixing strain  <dig> that harbors in this region a different  <dig> kbp insertion containing genes related to its symbiotic lifestyle. compared to ntuh-k <dig> each strain carries unique segments within this rgp: in kp <dig>  this unique region is  <dig> kbp-long and contains several uncharacterized genes  . since this ice is usually found in more virulent strains, the search for this region in other enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in brazil may help to estimate its frequency and importance in clinically relevant bacteria. rgp <dig> represents an insertion found only in the chromosomes of kp <dig> and mgh  <dig> and contains cdss with conserved domains at their predicted protein sequence such as glycosyltransferase , acyltransferase , two-component histidine kinase sensor  and peptidase . the presence of kexd  in this rgp called for special attention, since this gene codes for the recently characterized multidrug efflux pump kexd, an inner membrane protein belonging to the rnd family  <cit> . it was found to be overexpressed in a number of multidrug-resistant k. pneumoniae isolates, and confered resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, ethidium bromide and other drugs  <cit> . rgp <dig> contains kp13-specific fimbriae and adhesins genes  and this insertion occurs after a trna gene for threonine. the aco operon  involved in acetoin catabolism  <cit>  was also found in this region. it was detected in all compared strains, except for mgh  <dig> 

the large number of rgps detected in kp <dig> relative to the strains mgh  <dig>  ntuh-k <dig> and  <dig> indicate a complex pattern of gain and loss of genetic material segments that occurred during the shaping of each of the compared chromosomes throughout their evolutionary history. it is thought that such events occur more frequently in pathogenic than in non-pathogenic bacteria, the genomes of the first group being regarded as more unstable and rearrangement-prone  <cit> .

unique and shared genes between the compared k. pneumoniae
we have analyzed the group of shared and unique genes between kp <dig>  mgh  <dig>  ntuh-k <dig> and  <dig> to obtain insights that might explain their distinct virulence and pathogenic features.

the results from this analysis are shown in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  as expected, the majority of the coding sequences from the compared organisms are part of a conserved genomic ‘core’ comprising  <dig>  cdss . of these,  <dig> % are chromosomally located in kp <dig>  as the chromosomes are generally more stable replicons, it is not surprising that most of the conserved genes were detected in this genetic replicon. most of the so-called ‘accessory’ genes, which are present or not in bacterial strains, were found in plasmids of the compared k. pneumoniae. in kp <dig>  40% of its unique genes  were encoded in plasmids. the largest part of these unique genes  could not have any functional clues attributed and were annotated as ‘hypothetical’ , highlighting the need for follow-up studies focusing on whether these genes are in fact expressed and their possible roles.

among the shared genes found only in clinical isolates  we detected cdss whose products are related to phosphonate utilization . these were previously studied in klebsiella and may provide means to use alternative phosphorus sources such as aminoethylphosphonate, ethylphosphonate and methylphosphonate  <cit> . a cds coding for d-aminoacylase  was also detected, and shared 49% identity with the recently characterized protein from achromobacter xylosoxidans subsp. denitrificans . this enzyme is involved in the conversion of n-acyl-d-amino acids to d-amino acids and fatty acids  <cit> . cdss annotated as sulfatases were also found only in the clinical k. pneumoniae studied , and their products may play a role in sulphate utilization.

most of the unique genes found in kp <dig>  are related to mges such as transposases, insertion sequences and phage genes . there are also cdss whose products are involved in capsule formation  such as glycosyltransferases , which are unique to kp <dig>  the structure of this cluster was previously studied and belonged to a hitherto unreported capsular serotype  <cit> . cdss whose predicted proteins have similarity to fructosamine deglycase  and fructosamine kinase  were also unique to kp <dig>  these enzymes are usually involved in the utilization of amadori products, and fructosamine itself is produced via the condensation of glucose with amine compounds  <cit> . we formulated the hypothesis that, if indeed the products of these cdss play a role in fructosamine metabolism as energy source, they could provide the kp <dig> isolate with an adaptive advantage in the nosocomial setting, since amadori products are intimately related to advanced glycation end-products . in turn, ages are produced as result of poorly controlled chronic diseases such as diabetes  <cit> , and from this perspective these compounds could enter the bacterial cell through an adjacent transporter coded in cds kp <dig> and be converted into glucose by the aforecited enzymes, providing kp <dig> with an alternative energy source within the compromised host. in fact, kp <dig> was recovered from a blood culture of a diabetic patient. however, additional studies, using animal models, are required to establish the occurrence of increased frequency and/or exacerbation of kp13-infection in hyperglycemia. another set of unique genes found in kp <dig> included the cassettes sat , coding for streptothricin acetyltransferase involved in the resistance to streptothricin antibiotics in the context of a class  <dig> integron, and a cds whose product may be related to dihydrofolate reductase activity , which may confer resistance to trimethoprim. the latter will be further discussed in the context of blactx-m- <dig> 

virulence- and resistance-related ‘weapons’ identified in kp13
siderophores
iron scavenging is important within the mammalian host environment since its free form is usually found at very low concentrations under physiological conditions  <cit> . iron-acquisition systems were previously studied in other strains including ntuh-k <dig> and have been associated with increased virulence  <cit> . the list of siderophore systems found in kp <dig> is presented in additional file  <dig> 

we have identified genes coding for proteins responsible for the conversion of chorismic acid into enterobactin  as well as for the transport of this siderophore, which is ubiquitously found among enterobacteria . the fhuabcd system was also found in kp <dig>  and is involved in the uptake of ferrichrome, a fungal siderophore  <cit> . we have also found the genetic apparatus needed for yersiniabactin synthesis, which was previously discussed on the context of the plasticity region rgp <dig>  another siderophore receptor homolog  displaying 70% identity to the aerobactin receptor iuta  was found, and could also represent a way for kp <dig> to incorporate exogenous chelating compounds since the iucabcd cluster was not present in this strain, although it was found in the plasmid of ntuh-k <dig> . other siderophore-independent iron uptake systems in kp <dig> include the hmurstuv cluster , which probably code for an abc family heme transporter; the feo  cluster, which synthesizes three proteins  involved in fe2+ capture; and the sitabcd system, also from the abc family of proteins involved in the transport of divalent cation such as mn2+ and fe2+; found in cdss kp02550-kp <dig>  respectively. the diverse repertoire of iron uptake system detected in kp <dig> likely influence its ability to cause infection and survive within the human host.

adhesins
the expression of adhesins is important during the colonization stage when diverse mechanical forces such as peristalsis and salivary secretion all act to hamper bacterial invasion within the host  <cit> . the list of adhesins detected in k. pneumoniae kp <dig> and related bacteria is found in additional file  <dig>  most of the genes coding for these proteins were found in all k. pneumoniae strains compared, except for a fimbrial cluster present in a previously discussed plasticity region .

type  <dig> fimbriae coding genes were detected in kp <dig>  including the fim cluster . their products were previously reported as enhancing virulence during urinary tract infection caused by k. pneumoniae <cit> . the mrk cluster composed by five genes  that code for type  <dig> fimbriae is also present in kp <dig>  in k. pneumoniae, type  <dig> fimbriae have been identified as accessories mediating the formation of biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces such as catheters in the hospital environment  <cit> .

apart from type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  fimbrial adhesins, we also identified in kp <dig> six other clusters related to the expression of these virulence factors which were previously studied in strain ntuh-k <dig>  <cit> : kpa , kpb , kpd , kpe , kpf  and kpg . as has been previously observed  <cit> , strain  <dig> lacks the kpf cluster which was found in the clinical isolates and is composed by genes coding for a fimbrial subunit , a chaperone , an usher protein  and an adhesin . since strain  <dig> occupies a distinct ecological niche, further studies are warranted to determine the implications of kpf expression to the pathogenesis of clinical k. pneumoniae.

the identification of different adhesin clusters, including one previously unreported, should be important for the control of kp <dig> and related pathogenic bacteria, as these proteins have been already proposed as good vaccine candidates  <cit> .

enzymatic inactivation of antimicrobials
the resistance determinant blashv gene, which codes a narrow-spectrum class a beta-lactamase known to confer the intrinsic resistance to amoxicillin, ampicillin, ticarcillin and carbenicillin, was identified in kp <dig>  <cit> . indeed, both k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> and ntuh-k <dig> genomes contain a blashv- <dig> copy, encoding the narrow-spectrum shv variant. kp <dig> showed two copies of blashv genes: blashv- <dig>  encoding an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ; and a chromosomally-encoded blashv- <dig> gene coding for an enzyme whose spectrum of activity has not been characterized yet . the blashv- <dig> copy was located downstream an is <dig> element , while blashv- <dig> was found downstream the lac operon and was followed by an uncharacterized hth-type transcriptional regulator cds .

*,blastp against the ncbi database; chr, chromosome; nd, not determined; pkp <dig>  plasmid pkp13d/pkp13f.

several acquired beta-lactamase-encoding genes were identified in plasmids pkp13f and pkp13d of kp <dig>  namely blatem- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  blactx-m- <dig>  and blakpc- <dig> , genes that if properly expressed are enough to confer resistance to all beta-lactam agents. blatem- <dig> encodes a class-a beta-lactamase with limited spectrum of activity, that confers resistance against penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins and whose activity is inhibited by clavulanic acid  <cit> . the blaoxa- <dig> gene probably encodes a class-d beta-lactamase with narrow spectrum of activity, although its complete biochemical characterization remains to be determined. oxa- <dig> is inhibited by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin, but differently from most oxa enzymes is not inhibited by nacl, conferring a phenotype typical of class a enzymes production  <cit> . the blactx-m- <dig> gene encodes an esbl commonly observed in enterobacteriaceae isolates from humans, swine and poultry manure, although this gene has also been identified in p. aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae and acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates  <cit> . in kp <dig>  blactx-m- <dig> is found downstream a class  <dig> integrase cds  and adjacent to the orf513-coding gene , also named iscr <dig>  which possibly mediates the dissemination of this gene  <cit> . as previously described  <cit> , this integron contains a duplication of its 3′ segment where truncated qace  and sul <dig>  were found. the overall architecture of the blactx-m- <dig> region in kp <dig> is closer to that described for the class  <dig> integron harboring blactx-m- <dig>  recovered from patients in são paulo, brazil  <cit> , with which the kp <dig> sequence shares 99% identity , and the difference relies on the non-synonymous change in blactx-m- <dig>  this region also carries resistance determinants to other antimicrobial classes, including the genes dfrxvb , encoding an alternative dihydrofolate reductase that is associated with resistance to trimethoprim and a cmla-like , which codes for an efflux pump related to chloramphenicol resistance  <cit> . of special interest in kp <dig> was the detection of blakpc- <dig>  gene coding for the k. pneumoniae class a carbapenemase . the expression of kpc- <dig>  especially when associated with porin alterations, can give rise to resistance against all beta-lactams. the genetic context of blakpc- <dig> includes an upstream insertion sequence , as well as a resolvase cds . it is of notice that no inverted repeats related to tn <dig> were detected, since this transposon is frequently associated with the mobilization of the carbapenemase gene  <cit> . the absence of such signals can be regarded as evidence that the spread of blakpc- <dig> also occurs solely by recombination events involving iskpn <dig> and the flanking tn3-family sequences.

resistance by target alteration
mutations in specific sites in genes coding for proteins used as targets for antimicrobials, such as gyra and parc, can result in decreased drug sensitivity. kp <dig> showed the double substitutions ser83 → phe and asp87 → asn in gyra  which are known to confer ciprofloxacin resistance  <cit> . also, a single amino acid change, ser80 → ile, was detected in parc , and the combined effect of these mutations could have contributed to the high-level resistance to quinolones displayed by kp <dig> as has been shown for other pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . mgh  <dig> carries the ser83 → tyr mutation in gyra, while in ntuh-k <dig> no mutations in this gene were detected. no changes in the parc quinolone resistance-determining region were detected in these strains.

another well recognized resistance mechanism by target alteration is the expression of 16s rrna methyltransferases. these enzymes transfer methyl radicals to certain nitrogenous bases located at the a site of 16s rrna in the 30s portion of the ribosome and confers resistance to most clinically-relevant aminoglycosides  <cit> . kp <dig> harbored the rmtg gene  in plasmid pkp13f, which encodes a 16s rrna methyltransferase recently described from a k. pneumoniae clinical isolate from brazil  <cit> . immediately upstream this gene a putative trna ribosyltransferase cds  was found. a cds annotated as a transposase  is located close to the 3′-end of rmtg, and search against the isfinder database classified this sequence in the is <dig> family, although it is unclear whether this transposon is involved in the mobilization of rmtg.

efflux pumps, porin alterations and polymyxin resistance
we searched the genome of kp <dig> and related k. pneumoniae for known mdr efflux pumps. table  <dig> summarizes these results, which include pumps belonging to the five main families of efflux proteins. the tolc gene coding for accessory protein tolc used by many systems is found in cds kp <dig> in kp <dig>

one of the main efflux-related resistance mechanisms involves the expression of the acrab genes, coding for a periplasmic protein  and a transporter protein  which use the aforecited tolc channel. expression of these genes is regulated by the adjacent acrr gene , as well as by marr, ramr and soxr genes; mutations in these genes may result in acrab overexpression, thus contributing to the mdr phenotype  <cit> . however, we did not detect alterations in these genes, suggesting that other efflux systems in kp <dig> might be involved in the extrusion of antimicrobials . another well-studied efflux pump identified in kp <dig> and other compared k. pneumoniae strains is oqxab , which was first identified in e. coli plasmids. it has been widely reported in k. pneumoniae clinical isolates, where it is usually chromosomally located  <cit> . the expression of oqxab has been associated with resistance to quinolones  <cit> , and it remains to be investigated whether this system contributes to the high-level fluoroquinolones resistance displayed by kp <dig>  other efflux systems found in the compared k. pneumoniae include homologs of acrd , mdfa and mdth  , involved in the efflux of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones  <cit> , compounds to which kp <dig> displays resistance. the majority of the efflux pumps are conserved among the different strains and most of them can recognise more than one substrate . despite this qualitative conservation, we have identified several non-synonymous mutations in various genes coding efflux pumps in the kp <dig> genome when compared with ntuh-k <dig> and mgh  <dig> , although whether these alterations change the specificity profile of these systems remains an open question.

we studied the common porins present in k. pneumoniae bacteria, namely ompk <dig>  and ompk <dig> . in strain kp <dig>  the genes coding for these proteins are found in cdss kp <dig> and kp <dig>  respectively. while we observed an overall conservation at the gene sequence level between kp <dig> and the compared strains for both ompk35/ompk <dig>  a peculiarity in the chromosome of kp <dig> in the region upstream ompk <dig> was detected with the insertion of an is <dig> family transposase , which does not occur in the compared k. pneumoniae strains. multiple alignment of this region and in silico promoter search suggested that this recombination event disrupted the probable promoters needed for ompk <dig> expression . experimental evidence corroborating this hypothesis was obtained by the extraction and analysis of outer membrane  proteins using sds-page  <cit> , where ompk <dig> was not visualized . porin loss was previously studied in k. pneumoniae and the non-expression of ompk <dig> was associated with increased resistance to antibiotics such as cephalosporins and cephamycins  <cit> . thus, loss of ompk <dig> appears to be another mechanism employed by strain kp <dig> that contributed to its mdr profile.

polymyxin b is a rapid-acting bactericidal agent that interacts with the om lipopolysaccharide  in gram-negative bacteria. it was recently shown that the two-component systems phopq and pmrab together with the rcs system govern polymyxin-induced transcriptional changes, and that there is a cross talk between phopq and the rcs system  <cit> . in the genome of kp <dig>  we identified all these regulatory systems: phoqp , pmrab  and rcsbcd . transcriptional studies are ongoing to determine the regulons networks that govern polymyxin b-induced changes in kp <dig> 

interstrain variation at the nucleotide level may relate to lifestyle-specific adaptations
snps were determined for three comparisons using the complete chromosome sequence of kp <dig> as reference aligned against: i) the complete chromosome sequence of strain mgh  <dig>  ii) complete chromosome sequence of strain ntuh-k <dig> and iii) complete chromosome sequence of strain  <dig>  the number of snps falling within non-coding and coding regions  between each comparison are listed in figure 5a. it can be seen that strain  <dig> accumulated a total number of mutations much larger than the other two strains in comparison to kp <dig> . this result is in accordance with the proposed hypothesis that this strain should be reclassified as k. variicola <cit> . then, we investigated the common snps identified in all cdss of kp <dig>  against both pathogenic strains, mgh  <dig> and ntuh-k <dig> . these snps represented unique kp <dig> alleles relative to the latter two human pathogenic strains. disregarding uninformative categories such as general function prediction and unknown function, the ones which accumulated more snps were e  and g . also,  <dig> snps were identified within cdss related to category v . subsequently, in order to understand the significance of snps in relation to the kp <dig> lifestyle, we investigated all snps falling within cdss related to virulence and resistance. notably, most snps  were identified within cdss involved in drug resistance  . they are followed by cdss whose products function as om proteins, accounting for  <dig> mutations, such as the cds for an ompa domain-containing protein, which carries four non-synonymous mutations  . however, the role of non-synonymous mutations found among cdss involved in drug resistance in k. pneumoniae remains unknown.

the snps analysis performed in kp <dig> relative to the two other human pathogenic strains has shown that there are kp13-specific alleles occurring in many functional cogs, suggestive that these snps could result in a variety of diverse phenotypic effects. moreover, the amount of snps found in cdss associated with drug resistance may give additional clues on the distinctness of kp <dig> compared to mgh  <dig> and ntuh-k <dig>  an interesting follow-up for this study would be to analyze the relationship between the amino acid sequence substitutions in these proteins and their corresponding structural alterations, which could relate to the resistance phenotype of kp <dig>  as an example, non-synonymous mutations in possible mdr-related genes were detected, such as in mdtb  and an acrb homolog  .

finally, the results from the snps analysis shed light on the plasticity of the kp <dig> genome at the nucleotide level, which complement the observed plasticity at the broader level of genomic segments, discussed within the context of rgps.

CONCLUSIONS
we have thoroughly mined the genome of k. pneumoniae strain kp <dig>  which to our best knowledge is the first completely determined and closed genome of a k. pneumoniae representative involved in a large hospital outbreak. the kp <dig> genome is composed by one chromosome and six plasmids of variable sizes. they harbor multiple resistance and virulence loci, coding a diverse range of siderophores, efflux pumps, beta-lactamases and adhesins that might contribute to the succesfull adaptation of this strain to the hospital environment. we also identified alterations in the porin profile of kp <dig>  which were confirmed experimentally. multiple regions of genomic plasticity were detected in this strain including the yersiniabactin high pathogenicity island and t6ss-related loci, which could be propagating through hgt to related bacteria. although the compared genomes present an overall conserved architecture, we have demonstrated the singular characteristics of kp <dig> that differentiates this strain from previously studied k. pneumoniae and may have contributed to its fitness and succesfull spread on the hospital environment. within the context of chromossomal architecture and rgps analyses, we might also assume that the major force that models the genomes of the compared k. pneumoniae strains is hgt instead of genomic rearrangements. moreover, the genome plasticity of isolate kp <dig> was corroborated at multiple levels of analysis, from the broader, whole genome structure context, to the finer level of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
