BACKGROUND
the silkworm bombyx mori is the most economically important holometabolous lepidopteran and has recently became an experimental model for molecular entomology  <cit> . its silk gland is the most efficient protein synthesis machine among all organisms, which makes silkworm a desirable model for studying its mechanism. as the largest and most important part of the silk gland, the posterior compartment is most attractive since it synthesizes the silk core protein that determines the quality of silk cocoons. a recent proteomic study, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry , has identified  <dig> major proteins in the silk gland, of which there are several phosphorylated fibroin l-chain and p <dig> isoforms  <cit> . the posterior silk gland of the fifth instar has been further surveyed systematically for the understanding of molecular basis and regulatory mechanism of the posterior silk gland development and fibroin synthesis  <cit> . a recent transcriptomic survey has revealed a total of  <dig>  active genes differentially expressed in multiple silkworm tissues on the third day of the fifth-instar larva, of which  <dig> and  <dig> are up-regulated in the anterior-middle and the posterior silk glands, respectively  <cit> . these findings all provide basic data for studying the growth of the posterior silk gland and fibroin synthesis. however, micrornas -based study has not been done for the silk gland and its developing and functionally important compartments albeit justifiable for necessity .

as a large family of endogenous small non-coding rnas, mirnas are common regulatory rnas of eukaryotic organisms and play important roles in a wide range of biological processes under physiological and pathological conditions . despite lack of empirical data, computational approaches have made initial contributions to mirna study in b. mori, followed by next-generation sequencing efforts that profiled mirnas for different developmental stages and tissues . nevertheless, specifically focused study is still necessary since the expression of mirnas is largely temporal-spatial .

here, we report our mirna profiling of the fifth-instar posterior silk gland, using next-generation sequencing and microarray technologies. we show that  <dig> out of  <dig>  mirnas are novel and  <dig> of the total are identified in the third day of the posterior silk gland development. our go -based pathway assignment provides the first comprehensive categorization of b. mori mirnas in the posterior silk gland.

RESULTS
next-generation sequencing and data processing
rapid growth of the silk gland occurs at the fifth instar stage, and the gland is comprised of three distinct compartments: the anterior, the middle, and the posterior glands . compared with the other two parts, the anterior gland, albeit smaller, serves as a duct to transport  silk proteins that form the cocoon. the middle gland produces considerable quantities of sericins and the longest posterior gland grows rapidly, synthesizing a series of proteins including fibroin heavy and light chains plus fibroin p <dig> by exclusively ~ <dig> posterior gland cells of the fifth instar larva. as far as the biosynthesis of fibroin is concerned, the fifth instar stage can also be partitioned into two periods: the rapid formation and the massive secretion  <cit> . the third day of the fifth instar  completes a division during larval development and rapid cell growth occurs at this period of time. based on data from genome-scale expression profiling of the posterior silk gland, it has been concluded that gene expression profile from the fourth instar molting to the fifth instar day  <dig> before spinning forms two clusters that is divided at v <dig> from the fourth molting to wandering periods  <cit> . a large amount of genes encoding the fibroin light chain, fibrohexamerin p <dig>  transcription factors, structural proteins, glucose and other sugar transporters and proteins that aid in hormone signal transduction are up-regulated in the posterior silk gland from v <dig> to v <dig>  and are slightly down-regulated at the wandering stage  <cit> . therefore, changes of gene expression at the fifth instar may be responsible for growth and development of the posterior silk gland, especially various mirnas that play regulatory roles in post-transcriptional control  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the raw and processed data of all samples have been deposited in ncbi’s gene expression omnibus   <cit>  under accession number gse  <dig>  from  <dig>  million processed reads ranging from 18 ~ 30 nt in length , we first examined the length distribution of small rnas from ten libraries and found two extremely high peaks in most libraries; one was around 20 nt and the other around 28 nt . this result is consistent with the previous reports, where the first peak was proposed to represent mirnas and the other was interpreted as longer pirna-like small rnas  <cit> . we subsequently categorized non-coding small rnas and defined them according to rfam database  <dig> . the individual expression level of small rnas is very similar across the  <dig> libraries . we found that rrnas and trnas were the majority of all non-coding rna categories, as they are accounted for the most components of protein synthesis.table  <dig>

known and novel mirnas based on sequence data
after the removal of larger rnas, we mapped the remaining reads  to mirbase  <dig>   <cit>  using the deep-sequencing small rna analysis pipeline . dsap is a fast web server specially designed to analyze known mirnas generated from the illumina sequencing platform and yields satisfactory results  <cit> . our effort yielded  <dig> known mirnas , accounted for a large proportion of mirbase  <dig>  , which are 20–27 nt in size and have the highest abundance  in a range of 21–23 nt. we grouped them into  <dig> mirna families except for some undefined mirnas . based on cross-species analysis, these known mirnas are shared by ~ <dig> species. among them,  <dig> families are widely conserved in insects and  <dig> families are unique to b. mori. moreover,  <dig> families are distributed among  <dig> classes/phyla including both invertebrates and vertebrates .figure  <dig>

species analysis of known mirna families. all known mirnas are classified into  <dig> mirna families and one undefined group. the known mirnas are distributed over  <dig> species; among them  <dig> families are widely conserved in insects and  <dig> families are unique to b. mori.



the read count for different mirna is rather variable . for instance, the number of reads for bmo-mir-263a is extremely high as compared to other mirnas in all libraries; it may play a very important role in the posterior gland development and the result is in agreement with a previous report  <cit> . we also found  <dig> pairs of mirna/mirna* duplexes, in addition to  <dig> mirna*s without the corresponding mirnas. although most mirnas are more abundant than their corresponding mirna*s, there are exceptional cases, where bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir- <dig> are less abundant than their mirna* counterparts. similar findings have also been reported in other deep sequencing experiments and are suspected to be a result of incorrect annotations in mirbase .

having filtered the known non-coding rnas, we predicted novel candidate mirnas using the mireap package  <cit>  and classified  <dig>  candidate mirnas . given the fact that there are many random inverted repeats  in eukaryotic genomes and they can also fold into dysfunctional hairpins and undistinguished sequences, we took extra cautions to classify non-conserved mirnas. we used mirident classifier to identify the mirna candidates, which has been reported to achieves  <dig> % specificity and  <dig> % sensitivity on a human test data set  <cit> . we also evaluated two other svm-based prediction programs, triplet-svm and pmirp, together with mirident and using mirbase datasets that include data from  <dig> insect species . mirident classifier gave rise to better results for insect pre-mirna identification in our own hands  <cit> . using mirident classifier, we obtained  <dig> novel mirnas, corresponding to  <dig> unique sequences after filtering pseudo-pre-mirnas .

microarray-based mirna profiling
since the third day of fifth-instar larva  is a key time point for silk synthesis and rapid cell growth, we evaluated its mirna expression profile using  <dig>  custom-designed probes  that are classified into four group:   <dig>  known mirnas from mirbase, which consist of mirnas from several species, including silkworm  and  <dig> flies ;   <dig>  predicted novel mirnas;   <dig> probes based on data from four publications  <cit> ; and   <dig> control sequences. to ensure reproducibility, we double-gridded  <dig> sequences with read coverage of > <dig> from  <dig>  custom-designed probes for each chip.

we used  <dig> chips  for the study and normalized the data in log <dig> transformation. both technical  and biological repeats  showed consistent results . as mirna-based microarray experiments in general are reproducible , we readily identified  <dig> mature mirnas. among them,  <dig> are previously known and the remaining  <dig> include  <dig> conserved in drosophila and  <dig> novel ones . of the  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> are from a thorough collection from literature search and the remaining  <dig> are directly from the mirbase. these mirnas showed different expression patterns among the samples and did not exhibit any obvious correlation to information sources. for instance, bmo-bantam, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir-263a, bmo-mir-263b, bmo-mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir- <dig> are both literature-based and database collections but the mirbase-collected mirnas showed stronger signals. the contrary results were found among bmo-let- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir-279c, where the literature-based collections showed higher expression levels . we inferred that this non-uniformity might be a result of different technical platforms. one discussion point on this study is the validation rate: only  <dig> novel mirnas  from the sequencing data are confirmed in the microarray experiment. the reasons for such low confirmation are multifold. first,  <dig> mature mirnas are detected on the third day of fifth instar but not on the entire stage, where samples are collected and pooled from the fourth instar molting to the fifth instar day  <dig> before spinning. the false negative results for some of the mirnas are largely due to the dilution of the time-sensitive specific mirnas over pooling  <cit> . second, the marginal level of mirna expression is pushing the detection limit so that some of the signals may not be consistently detected even when the same experiments are repeated. third, sampling bias may be inherent from the sequencing approach, where sampling bias is obvious for low copy transcripts  <cit> .

there are  <dig> mirna genes whose expression patterns have been reported to correspond to  <dig> loci in the b. mori genome  <cit> . after the removal of redundant sequences, we found that the two datasets shared  <dig> mirnas . among these mirnas,  <dig> genes showed posterior gland expression in the current study but have not been detected in the previous study. conversely, from  <dig> mirnas identified previously in two public datasets for posterior-silk-gland expression,  <dig> were negative in our study. in addition, seven  out of  <dig> posterior-gland specific mirnas defined previously were not detected in our microarray experiment . these results suggest that our experiment covered most of the b mori mirnas but inconsistency does exist, attributable to the difference between technical platforms.

target gene prediction and pathway analysis
combining results from both deep sequencing and microarray, we identified  <dig>  mirnas expressed in the posterior silk gland in the period of the fourth-instar molting to the fifth-instar  spinning, and among which  <dig> are novel, named as bmo-mir-pxxx-xp series , and  <dig> are mirna/mirna* duplexes . we also profiled  <dig> mirnas for the third day of the fifth-instar larva . we subsequently predicted potential targets using miranda v <dig> a  <cit>  and the effort yielded  <dig>  targets in the entire stage, corresponding to  <dig>  mirnas. the rest  <dig> mirnas did not yield target genes due to low scores . we associated  <dig>  and  <dig>  target genes to  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas in the third day of the fifth instar, respectively .

we annotated all mirna target genes based on go analysis and found that they are largely involved in cell, cell part, binding, catalytic, cellular process, metallochaperone, proteasome regulator, and metabolic process, as opposed to the underrepresented synapse, synapse part, and viral reproduction . this result suggests that mirnas may regulate mostly the expression of structural protein genes in the posterior gland than those involved in the development of neural and immune systems. furthermore, our go analysis on the target genes of novel mirnas and those detected at the third day of the fifth instar showed a similar result to that of the total mirnas, except the absence of viral reproduction in biological process terms and metallochaperone in molecular function terms. finally, as the major silk protein secretary organ, the posterior silk gland has an increased ribosome content  <cit> , and it has been reported that ribosomal proteins are abundantly expressed in the final instar and play key roles in modulating activity of ribosome  <cit> . our result confirmed this observation.figure  <dig> 
go analyses of the target genes predicted by miranda in the posterior silk gland. we analyzed three groups of mirnas:  v <dig>   <dig> mirnas detected at the third day of fifth instar;  entire stage,  <dig>  mirnas discovered at the periods from the fourth instar molting to the fifth instar day  <dig> before spinning, and  novel,  <dig> mirnas first detected in this study.



based on further comparison of biological pathways among three datasets , we showed that  <dig>  out of  <dig>  predicted targets in the entire stage were involved in  <dig> kegg pathways . the other two sets of target genes shared a similar result, where  <dig>  and  <dig>  target genes from the novel mirnas and v <dig> group were mapped onto these pathways, respectively . furthermore, there were  <dig> target genes mapped to the ribosome pathway  and  <dig> target genes involved in protein processing of endoplasmic reticulum pathway in the entire stage . since translation-level regulation of ribosomal proteins is critical for fibroin synthesis  <cit> , most of the target genes  were mapped to ribosome pathway for all three datasets as compared to other pathways, and these target genes almost covered all the genes in this pathway . these results indicate that mirnas expressed in the fifth instar of posterior silk gland showed strong regulatory functions on the silk protein synthesis.figure  <dig>

other involved pathways are also informative. first,  <dig> target genes are related to rna transport pathway, and  <dig> target genes are mapped to rna degradation pathway . nearly  <dig> and  <dig> target genes are involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolisms, respectively . the results indicate active regulations of transcription and nucleotide metabolism. second,  <dig> target genes are found to be involved in oxidative phosphorylation pathway . the atp production pathway may coordinate with nucleotide metabolic pathways for energy generation. third,  <dig> and  <dig> target genes are related to ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and proteasome pathways, respectively . since ubiquitin proteolytic system plays an important role in a broad array of basic cellular processes including regulation of cell cycle, modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses, control of signal transduction pathways, development and differentiation, and these complex processes are controlled by specific degradation of a single or a subset of proteins  <cit> , the discovery of such a significant involvement is of importance. fourth, we observed  <dig> target genes mapped to cell cycle pathway  which suggests that these mirnas may be regulators of cell cycle. it has been well established that cell division only occurs during the embryonic development, and the number of cells in the posterior silk gland no longer increases throughout the larval life  <cit> . finally, pathway analysis results showed highly consistency between the three datasets: the entire stage, the novel mirnas, and the v <dig> group.

CONCLUSIONS
from  <dig> small rna libraries, we acquired ~ <dig> million processed reads ranging from 18–30 nt in length, identified  <dig>  mirnas , and profiled  <dig> mirnas at the third day of the fifth instar larva. we also found  <dig> novel mirnas  and reared them on fresh mulberry leaves under standard condition. we used three sets of samples according to genes expression cluster analysis  <cit> :  stage 1: fourth instar molting to day  <dig> of fifth instar from q, b, qb, and bq);  stage 2: fifth instar day  <dig> to day  <dig> before spinning; and  entire stage: stage 1 +  <dig> from r <dig> and j <dig>  the samples were collected daily and dissected and stored at low temperature in  <dig> % nacl. samples were subsequently rinsed and stored in liquid nitrogen.

small rna library construction and solexa sequencing
total rna was extracted from the posterior silk gland with trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for mirna-seq, total rna of the desired size range  was size-fractionated on a 15% page gel and ligated with to sequence adapters . after amplified for 15 cycles, the products were separated on agarose gels and the rt-pcr products were sequenced on the illumina platform   <cit> .

sequence analysis and microrna prediction
raw sequence reads of 35 nt in size were generated and unique reads of full-length small rna sequences  were analyzed with deep sequencing small rna analysis pipeline  . unique reads matching silkworm non-coding rna  deposited at the ncbi genbank database and rfam  <dig>  were removed. the clean reads from raw dataset were matched to the known mirna in mirbase  <dig>   to identify conserved mirnas and annotated stem-loop sequences. after strict screening, the remaining sequences were regarded as candidate mirnas for further analysis.

to determine potential novel mirnas, we identified candidate mirnas using the mireap program , which is an algorithm developed by bgi, which can be used to identify known mirnas and novel candidates with canonical hairpin structure and sufficiently supported by sequencing data. in the present study, mireap parameters were set to match the condition of animal mirnas identification as follows:  the length range of the mirna sequence: 20–24 nt;  the maximal free energy allowed for an mirna precursor: -18 kcal/mol;  the minimal common base pairs between mirna and mirna*:  <dig> with no more than four bulges; and  the maximal asymmetry of mirna/mirna* duplex: 5 nt. following mirna prediction, secondary structures were predicted by using the zuker algorithm that evaluates hairpin forming potential .

microarray analysis
to determine comprehensive mirna expression profiles on the third day of fifth instar larvae, we collaborated with lc bio co. ltd  developed and designed mirna probes. considering that mirna expression profiles may vary in different varieties and genders  <cit> , we collected both male and female silkworms from four stains  in duplicates. the small rna fraction was extracted with trizol reagent . to ensure the quality of the rna, we used checked rna quality and quantity with spectrophotometer and size-fractionated it using ym- <dig> microcon centrifugal filter . after adding poly-a tails, hybridization  was used was carried out on a μparaflo™ microfluidic chip   <cit> . after imagine acquisition  and background removal, we normalized the signals using a lowess  method  <cit> , classified the data using a hierarchical clustering method and average linkage and euclidean distance metric, and visualized the results with tigr mev .

target gene prediction analysis
due to lack of available 3’-utr database, we first estimated the unigenes from ncbi  and considered 1 kb as a suitable length for silkworm 3’-utr. then, according to the annotation of silkdb <dig>  , 1 kb sequences after the last exon of annotated genes were selected as target gene region. finally, we used miranda v <dig> a  to predict potential targets. the thresholds for candidate target sites were set at s ≥  <dig> and Δg < -20 kcal/mol  <cit> .

gene ontology and kegg pathways analysis
we analyzed the function of mirna targets based on gene ontology through searching against interpro and kegg databases , using interproscan, wego , and uniprotkb .
