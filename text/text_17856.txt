BACKGROUND
aluminum  toxicity is one of the major constraints for crop production on acidic soils, which comprise over 50% of the world’s potentially arable lands  <cit> . under low soil ph, al is solubilized into highly rhizotoxic ionic forms, primarily al3+, that inhibit root growth, reducing water and nutrient uptake  <cit> . although liming and other agronomic practices can ameliorate soil acidity, such technologies are not readily available for a large number of small-scale farmers particularly in the developing world, where agriculture is the main source of income and food. in addition to naturally occurring acid soils, soil acidification has been reported after 21 years of no-tillage crop system in the south of brazil  <cit> , an agricultural production method now largely adopted worldwide  <cit> . maize is the most produced cereal in the world and is widely used in animal feed, human food and industrial purposes. in addition, maize is a major staple food in africa and latin america where acid soils are common  <cit> . therefore, efforts to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying maize al tolerance are expected to accelerate the development of al-tolerant cultivars.

al tolerance has been shown to be controlled by major genes in wheat  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , and barley  <cit> . these plant species were used to clone the first al tolerance genes, which were involved in organic acid exudation to exclude al from the root apex. the al tolerance gene in wheat encodes an aluminum-activated malate transporter  responsible for malate release from root apices  <cit> . subsequently, almt <dig> homologs with a role in al tolerance were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> , rape  <cit> , and rye  <cit> . another gene family involved in al tolerance is the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  family that was originally associated with al-activated citrate release in sorghum   <cit>  and barley   <cit> . in addition, mate homologs confer al tolerance in arabidopsis   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , rye   <cit> , maize   <cit> , and rice   <cit> .

al tolerance is quantitatively inherited in arabidopsis  <cit> , maize , and rice . evidences for internal al detoxification as a complementary al tolerance mechanism have been supported by the identification of genes encoding atp binding cassette transporters in arabidopsis   <cit>  and rice . additionally, nramp aluminum transporter  <dig>  is an aluminum transporter localized on the plasma membrane, which is required in the initial steps of internal al detoxification in rice  <cit> . the expression of many genes involved in al tolerance is regulated by a cys2-his <dig> zinc finger transcription factor in arabidopsis   <cit>  and in rice   <cit> . in fact, art <dig>  star <dig> and nrat <dig> co-localized with al tolerance qtls in rice  <cit> , indicating that qtl mapping is a useful tool to help in the validation of candidate al tolerance genes.

al tolerance is a complex trait in maize , with possible involvement of multiple genes and physiological mechanisms. one such mechanism is root citrate release  <cit> , although other mechanisms are likely to contribute to maize al tolerance  <cit> . however, it is noteworthy that only a few qtls  and candidate genes  <cit>  have been reported for al tolerance on this crop. combining association and linkage mapping, four candidate genes were associated with al tolerance in maize, zea mays altsb-like , zmalmt <dig>  malic enzyme and s-adenosyl-l-homocysteinase  <cit> . however, functional characterization of zmalmt <dig> did not support a role in maize al tolerance  <cit> . two maize homologs of sorghum sbmate, zmmate <dig> and zmmate <dig>  co-localized with al tolerance qtls  <cit>  that were consistently detected in other qtl studies  <cit> . zmmate <dig> was not conclusively implicated in al tolerance, but zmmate <dig> is up-regulated by al and encodes a membrane transporter responsible for al-activated citrate exudation in root apices of al-tolerant maize lines  <cit> . recently, three copies of zmmate <dig> were associated with high expression of this gene, which was proposed to underlie a major al tolerance qtl mapped on maize chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

here we performed a marker-trait association study with unprecedented marker density generated by genotyping-by-sequencing   <cit>  to provide a detailed description of the genetic complexity underlying maize al tolerance. five qtls highly associated with al tolerance were identified with  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms . based on our results, zmnrat <dig>  which encodes a protein sharing high amino acid sequence identity with the rice al3+ transporter, nrat <dig>  is a candidate gene for further al tolerance studies in maize. we also validated a major al tolerance qtl, qalt <dig>  which was able to improve al tolerance in maize nils. finally, a novel al tolerance source in maize based on zmmate <dig> was identified, which does not rely on copy number variation to maintain high levels of zmmate <dig> expression.

RESULTS
multiple genomic regions are associated with al tolerance in maize
significant genotypic differences for relative net root growth  were detected in the ril population, which was used to assess al tolerance. net root growth in control conditions  was also assessed as a measurement of intrinsic differences in root growth that are not necessarily related to al tolerance . the heritability estimates based on family means were  <dig>  for rnrg and  <dig>  for nrg_c, with a coefficient of variation close to 10% for both traits .table  <dig>

aluminum tolerance has been traditionally phenotyped based on the degree of root growth inhibition in al-treated plants, relative to a -al control, to remove possible confounding effects caused by intrinsic differences in root growth. to confirm that al tolerance qtls were not artifacts caused by variation in root growth unrelated to al tolerance, qtls were also mapped for nrg_c. three genomic regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were associated with nrg_c, explaining approximately 57% of the total phenotypic variance . only the root growth qtl on chromosome  <dig>  was located near the al tolerance qtl qalt <dig>  but with opposite effects, indicating that for this qtl, selection to improve al tolerance may cause a reduction in root length. nevertheless, the other al tolerance qtls were not affected by root growth in the absence of al.table  <dig>

candidate genes on qalt5
qalt <dig> explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for rnrg and spanned a genomic region from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig>  based on the current annotation of the b <dig> refgen_v <dig> genome sequence ,  <dig> gene models are predicted in this region, of which  <dig> were covered by at least one snp significantly associated with al tolerance . among these genes, we selected zmmate <dig> predicted at  <dig>  mbp, which was previously characterized as a membrane transporter and putatively associated with al tolerance in maize  <cit> . maize nils on the al sensitive background belonging to l <dig> introgressed with zmmate <dig> were as al-sensitive as was l <dig> , and showed similar zmmate <dig> expression levels to the parents . zmmate <dig> was not differentially expressed between the parental lines , as reported by maron et al. <cit> . however, when the expression pattern of zmmate <dig> was investigated in the rils, one expression qtl  explaining  <dig> % of the variance for zmmate <dig> expression was revealed at  <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig> , a position different from the target gene on chromosome  <dig> figure  <dig>

interestingly, another peak was detected close to qalt <dig>  at  <dig>  mbp, but it was not significant in the multi-snp regression model . in the vicinity of this putative peak, we identified the predicted gene grmzm2g <dig> at  <dig>  mbp, sharing 83% of amino acid sequence identity to rice nrat <dig>  the tissue specificity of zmnrat <dig> was then evaluated after 6 hours of al exposure in both parental lines . the results demonstrate that zmnrat <dig> is highly induced by al in root tips, moderately expressed in basal root segments  and is not expressed in shoots. a detailed time course response to al treatment of root tips revealed that zmnrat <dig> was up-regulated by al at very early stages in the tolerant line, reaching the maximum level after 1 hour of al treatment, whereas in the al-sensitive line the highest expression was achieved 3 hours after exposure to al .figure  <dig>

candidate genes on qalt6
a highly significant qtl region was detected from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp , explaining a large proportion of the variation in al tolerance. this genomic region encompassed zmmate <dig> although none of the  <dig>  snps tagged this candidate gene. instead, a sequence-tagged site  marker generated within zmmate <dig> had the highest –log for rnrg . a single eqtl, explaining  <dig> % of the variance for zmmate <dig> expression, overlapped the qalt <dig> region where zmmate <dig> lies on chromosome  <dig> . this confirms previous results obtained at much lower snp density, i.e.  <dig>  snps on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

the cateto al <dig> introgression region in the qalt6-nils was estimated as  <dig> mbp, extending from positions  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig>  this region includes the sts marker for zmmate <dig> at position  <dig>  mbp, which showed the highest –log with rnrg within qalt <dig>  the qalt6-nil harboring the cateto al <dig> allele showed a two-fold increase in al tolerance when compared to the l <dig> counterpart . the former exhibited also high zmmate <dig> expression  and three copies of zmmate <dig>  similarly to the donor parent cateto al <dig> .figure  <dig>

phylogeny of mate members in maize
forty-three predicted mate members found in the maize genome were clustered in two major groups, one of them comprising citrate transporters associated with al tolerance in different plant species that included five maize mates . these five predicted maize mate proteins shared between  <dig> and 69% sequence identity to sbmate, including zmmate <dig> and zmasl, which was previously associated with al tolerance  <cit>  . of the five candidate mate members analyzed, only zmmate <dig> was co-localized with al tolerance qtls mapped in this study.

identification of high zmmate1expression in brazilian maize lines
high zmmate <dig> expression is associated with superior al tolerance in maize rils and nils harboring the cateto al <dig> allele at qalt <dig>  thus, zmmate <dig> expression pattern under al stress was investigated in  <dig> maize lines derived from the embrapa breeding program including the intermediately al-tolerant, temperate maize line b <dig>  the embrapa elite lines showed a wide range of al tolerance based on rnrg at {39} μm al3+, ranging from al-sensitive  to highly al-tolerant  . the broad sense heritability estimate for al tolerance was  <dig> , with an accuracy of  <dig> . in addition to the highly tolerant cateto al <dig>  seven lines in the panel showed high zmmate <dig> expression . these were l228- <dig> as well as six elite lines derived from l228- <dig>  all of which are intermediately al-tolerant. interestingly, l228- <dig> and its derived elite lines did not carry the three copies of zmmate <dig> reported for cateto al <dig> . the presence of a single copy of zmmate <dig> in these maize lines was indicated by two qpcr assays, cnv <dig> and cnv <dig>  amplifying a fragment of the second exon and the 3′utr region of zmmate <dig>  respectively  <cit> . thus, high expression of zmmate <dig> in these lines is likely mediated by a mechanism other than copy-number variation as proposed for cateto al <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
the genetic complexity of al tolerance in maize was dissected using a large number of markers provided by next-generation sequencing in a ril population derived from two highly contrasting maize lines. for qtl mapping, a procedure similar to multiple interval mapping was implemented, based on a multi-snp regression model, which accommodated multiple qtls simultaneously.

five genomic regions were found to be highly associated with al tolerance as measured by rnrg, including the novel qtl, qalt <dig>  we also mapped a large-effect qtl for root growth under control  condition that was relatively close to qalt <dig> . qtls associated with root length were also previously mapped to a region surrounding qalt <dig>   <cit> . moreover, this region was flanked by two consensus qtls, rt- <dig> and rt- <dig>  which have been implicated in the control of several root traits in different maize populations  <cit> . thus, although qalt <dig> does not overlap with qnrg_c <dig>  further use of this al-tolerance qtl in maize breeding programs may lead to the introgression of undesirable alleles for root length due to linkage drag.

the other four al tolerance qtls coincided with regions previously reported to be related to maize al tolerance. the rflp markers umc <dig> and umc <dig>  located at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig>  respectively, were associated with al tolerance in five different maize crosses  <cit> . also, an al tolerance qtl was mapped in a genomic region equivalent to  <dig>  -  <dig>  mbp on maize chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . despite the low saturation of markers used in these studies, it is plausible that these regions could be overlapping to qalt <dig> . similarly, the al tolerance qtl identified on chromosome  <dig> by ninamango-cárdenas et al. <cit>  is likely to correspond to qalt <dig> 

the qtl, qalt <dig>  reported here, was coincident with an al tolerance qtl mapped on maize chromosome  <dig>  which co-localized with zmmate <dig> <cit> . this candidate gene was previously characterized as a putative anion transporter that was however unable to mediate citrate efflux  <cit> . this is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis where zmmate <dig> was not included in the major group composed of all mates functionally identified as citrate transporters in other plants . to test the hypothesis raised by maron et al. <cit>  that the al-sensitive line, l <dig>  would carry positive regulatory factors for zmmate <dig> expression, we mapped a trans-eqtl controlling part of zmmate <dig> expression on chromosome  <dig>  our data confirmed that maize nils with the zmmate <dig> allele from cateto al <dig> in the genetic background of l <dig> showed the same zmmate <dig> expression level as the parental lines. additionally, these maize nils were as al-sensitive as the sensitive recurrent line, l <dig>  thus, zmmate <dig> was constitutively expressed, independently of the source of trans-acting factors, either l <dig> or cateto al <dig>  as zmmate <dig> amino acid sequences from cateto al <dig> and l <dig> were identical  <cit> , we can infer that zmmate <dig> is not the candidate gene controlling al tolerance on qalt <dig>  at least in our maize germplasm.

outside of the qalt <dig> confidence interval but near a putative qtl peak, we identified a maize homologue to rice nrat <dig>  named here as zmnrat <dig>  osnrat <dig> encodes an nramp aluminum transporter involved in intracellular al3+ uptake in rice  <cit> . in our study, zmnrat <dig> was up-regulated by al primarily in root tips, following an expression pattern similar to that observed for the rice osnrat <dig> <cit> . however, the main difference found between the contrasting maize lines for al tolerance was the early al-induction of zmnrat <dig> in the al-tolerant cateto al <dig>  a previous report based on microarray analysis indicated that zmnrat <dig> was also induced by al in root tips of the al-tolerant cateto 100– <dig> after  <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours of al treatment and only after  <dig> and 24 hours in the al-sensitive line   <cit> . thus, these studies consistently showed that zmnrat <dig> is rapidly induced by al in tolerant maize lines , whereas induction in the al-sensitive line, l <dig>  is delayed. functional evidence in rice knockout mutants supported a role for nrat <dig> in al tolerance  <cit> . in addition, genomic regions surrounding this candidate gene on rice chromosome  <dig> were also shown to contribute to natural variation for al tolerance in a bi-parental qtl mapping  <cit>  and in the aus subpopulation in a genome-wide association study  <cit> . nevertheless, the nrat <dig> qtl region explained a low percentage of al tolerance in a backcross introgression line population derived from temperate japonica x aus <cit>  and no qtl in this region was reported in a cross between tropical japonica and indica <cit> , suggesting that the effect of this qtl is dependent on the genetic background. the non-significance of the qtl peak spanning the zmnrat <dig> region may be explained by: i) the presence of a significant qtl  close to this candidate gene that may have retained the genetic variance of this surrounding region; and ii) the reduced population size, which limits the power to resolve two closely linked qtls. however, the evidence presented here warrants further investigation on the involvement of zmnrat <dig> on the internal al detoxification mechanism in maize.

the major al tolerance qtl on chromosome  <dig>  was also identified in other qtl studies  <cit> . within this qtl region, we mapped zmmate <dig> as well as a major eqtl controlling its expression. the overexpression of zmmate <dig> was shown previously to improve al tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis  <cit> . here we demonstrate that the high expression of zmmate <dig> almost doubled the al tolerance of maize nils when qalt <dig> was introgressed into an al-sensitive line. these nils harbored three copies of zmmate <dig>  confirming that the functional allele derived from cateto al <dig> was transferred. interestingly, the expression pattern of zmmate <dig> in maize nils was quite different from sbmate in sorghum nils, which was down-regulated when different alleles were introgressed into a common, al-sensitive background  <cit> . this reduction in sbmate expression was closely correlated with a decrease in al tolerance, suggesting an incomplete transfer of regulatory factors acting in trans on sbmate <cit> . marker-assisted introgression of sbmate would be dependent on the genetic background and may require additional genomic regions carrying accessory factors necessary for the full expression of sbmate. in maize, introgression of qalt <dig> seems to be enough for reaching full expression of zmmate <dig>  thus, our results, together with those presented in previous reports  <cit> , strongly support that zmmate <dig> is the gene underlying qalt <dig>  which enhances al tolerance through its up-regulation under al stress.

cateto is a group of maize landraces from south america that were extensively adopted by native indians and were also used as commercial varieties or in local hybrid programs  <cit> . cateto lines were identified as highly al-tolerant under field conditions  <cit>  and in nutrient solution  <cit>  in the early 1980’s. since then, cateto lines have been considered as major sources of al tolerance in maize. three cateto lines have been the subject of detailed genetic, physiological, and molecular studies of al tolerance: cateto al <dig>  <cit> , cat100- <dig>  <cit> , and cateto colombia  <cit> . the high al tolerance of these lines in nutrient solution was mainly associated with an al-exclusion mechanism mediated by al-activated citrate exudation in root tips  <cit> . among those, only the native brazilian lines, cateto al <dig> and cat100- <dig>  were confirmed to show high zmmate <dig> expression controlled by three-copies of this gene, which is considered to be the major molecular mechanism underlying citrate exudation in those lines  <cit> . as cateto landraces were widely cultivated by natives and early farmers in south america  <cit> , it is reasonable to expect that their extreme al tolerance accounts for their superior adaptation to acid soils. however, these landraces carry undesirable traits, reducing their potential for direct use in commercial maize breeding programs  <cit> . thus, the introgression of al tolerance alleles from native races into maize elite lines is an important target to improve maize stability in tropical soils.

a further characterization of tropical maize lines revealed that l228- <dig> and its derived elite lines also presented high zmmate <dig> expression. however, in contrast to cateto al <dig> and cat100- <dig> lines that carry this gene in triplicate  <cit> , only a single copy of zmmate <dig> was found in l228- <dig> and its derived lines. l228- <dig> is the main founder of the dent heterotic group from the embrapa maize breeding program  <cit> , which was derived from the open pollinated variety br <dig>  as a result of  <dig> selection cycles in the tuxpeño composite  <cit> . elite dent lines extracted from br <dig> were used to develop commercial hybrids widely cultivated in brazilian cerrado, including br <dig>  a double cross hybrid that occupied up to 14% of the brazilian seed market from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . we can infer that, in l228- <dig>  a different molecular mechanism to copy number variation  would enhance zmmate <dig> expression under al stress, conferring an important advantage to acid soils adaptation.

CONCLUSIONS
the high zmmate <dig> expression controlled either by cnv or by another molecular mechanism that underlies qalt <dig>  in addition to significantly improving al tolerance in maize, is rare and restricted to a few south american landraces, mainly from brazil and colombia. thus, we may expect that a large proportion of modern maize lines that range from al sensitive to intermediate in al tolerance could be improved for al tolerance via marker-assisted introgression of this genomic region.
