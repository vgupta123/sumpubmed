BACKGROUND
asparagus racemosus  is an important medicinal plant which has been used worldwide. the asparagus genus  has over  <dig> species which are widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions including india, china, korea and japan  <cit> . its medicinal properties are reported in traditional systems of medicine such as ayurveda, siddha and unani  <cit> . the plant is a spinous under shrub with tuberous short rootstock bearing numerous succulent tuberous roots  that are silvery white or ash-colored externally and white internally  <cit> .

the tuberous root of a. racemosus is used in traditional indian medicine for the treatment of diverse ailments, including dysentery, tumors, inflammations, neuropathy, nervous disorders, bronchitis, hyperacidity, certain infectious diseases  <cit> , conjunctivitis  <cit> , chronic fevers, and rheumatism  <cit> . pharmacological studies with animals have manifested the potency of a. racemosus extract as an antioxidant  <cit> , antianaphylactic  <cit> , adaptogen  <cit> , antistress  <cit> , antiulcer  <cit> , antidiarrhoeal  <cit> , antibacterial  <cit> , antitussive  <cit> , molluscicide  <cit> , radioprotective agent  <cit> , and as a substrate for inulinase production  <cit>  with the biggest focus being on its ability in modulating the immune system  <cit> . one human trial confirmed the herb’s potency in treating dyspepsia  <cit> . due to its vast medicinal properties it is well known as an antispasmodic, aphrodisiac, demulcent, diuretic, galactagogue and refrigerant in indian medicine   <cit> .

a limited number of steroidal saponins have been reported previously from the roots of a. racemosus, with the major ones being shatavarins i, iv, v  <cit>  and immunosides  <cit> . taxol, a steroidal saponin of taxus bravifolia bark is currently being used in cancer chemotherapy  <cit> . diosgenin, -spirost-5-en-3β-ol, is a steroidal sapogenin isolated from the plants  <cit> . it is very useful in pharmaceutical industries as a natural source of steroidal hormones. recent studies have found that steroidal sapogenin can be absorbed through the gut and plays an important role in the control of cholesterol metabolism  <cit> . other authors have reported that it has estrogenic effects  <cit>  and antitumor activity  <cit> . mcanuff et al.  reported that steroidal sapogenins were effective agents for the treatment of hypocholesterolemia, a disorder often associated with diabetes  <cit> .

the diverse structures of steroidal saponins make them valuable in commercial applications, as well as in drugs and medicines. it is thought that steroidal sapogenins are biosynthesized from cholesterol via a series of oxygenation and hydroxylation steps, and that they are then glycosylated to form steroidal saponins  <cit> . the mevalonate pathway or hmg-coa reductase pathway or mevalonate-dependent route or isoprenoid pathway, is an important cellular metabolic pathway present in all higher eukaryotes and many bacteria. the mevalonate pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of numerous essential molecules including prenyl groups, coenzyme q, dolichol, and sterols such as cholesterol  <cit> . the knowledge of steroidal biosynthesis is derived from studies of cholesterol production through acetate → mevalonate → isopentenyl pyrophosphate → squalene pathway. the biosynthesis of cholesterol involves cyclization of aliphatic triterpene-squalene  <cit> . cholesterol has been found to be an effective precursor for diosgenin  <cit> . however, the enzymes and genes involved in the biosynthesis of these complex molecules are largely uncharacterized. only a limited number of enzymes have been identified and characterized that play an important role in the modification of the saponin backbone structure. this includes enzymes like cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase, uridine diphosphate glycosyltransfearse  and other enzyme  <cit> . secondary metabolic pathway genes are more diverse in comparison with those involved in primary metabolism. the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has permitted new approaches to explore functional genomics, including the direct sequencing of complementary cdna generated from messenger and structural rnas . transcriptome analysis followed by identification of potential candidate genes involved in the secondary metabolic pathway will lead to a better understanding of biosynthesis, its regulation and chemical diversity of secondary metabolites.

a. racemosus is well known medicinal ayurvedic plant listed in the british pharmacopoeias. here we have performed the pair end transcriptome sequencing of root and leaf tissue of a. racemosus. paired end sequencing improves the efficiency of de novo assembly and also increases the depth of sequencing. using different assembly programs we have reported the most appropriate, assembled set of non redundant transcripts identified. the resulting assembled transcripts were functionally annotated, and the transcripts involved in secondary metabolic biosynthetic pathway were analyzed. the occurrence and fold induction of differentially expressed transcripts in leaf or root was further analyzed using digital gene expression analysis followed by their validation using q-rt pcr analysis. sixteen putative transcripts involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis were analyzed for their relative expression in response to methyl jasmonate treatment. this data will lead to the advancement in the understanding of saponin biosynthetic pathway. the enzyme/transcript identified will serve the purpose of engineering of steroidal saponin biosynthesis in other medicinal plants.

RESULTS
sequence quality control and de novoassembly
cdna libraries prepared from rna isolated from leaf and root tissues of a. racemosus were sequenced and a total of  <dig> and  <dig> raw reads were generated comprising  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide bases from illumina gaii analyzer/ <dig> gs flx/ <dig> solid system. sequencing accounts for approximately  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  gb of data for leaf and root samples of a. racemosus  respectively. raw reads were subjected to quality control by using seqqc-v <dig> . low quality reads which contain adapters or unknown or low quality bases were discarded. finally, in total  <dig> and  <dig> reads were generated from leaf and root samples respectively. the quality of a de novo assembly is dependent on many factors, such as the selection of an assembler followed by parameters like hash length, n <dig> value and coverage. the quality of the transcriptome assembly may also be determined by the assembly software that is employed to assemble the short read data. velvet assembler was used to produce a preliminary fragmented assembly, containing the mapping of the reads onto a set of contigs. after reading the contigs produced by velvet, oases proceeds to correct them again with a set of dynamic and static filters. a total of  <dig> reads from leaf  and  <dig>  reads from root  sample were selected for assembly by velvet programme and  <dig>  reads from leaf  and  <dig> reads from root sample  were selected for assembly by using oases program. the overall strategy is schematically represented in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> contigs for leaf and  <dig> contigs for root are generated by using velvet programme and  <dig> transcripts for leaf and 78684contigs for root are obtained by using oases programme. in both samples, the average length of contig range from  <dig> bases to more than  <dig> bases . average contig length by using oases programme was more  than the average contig length generated by using velvet programme . the sequences from both the libraries were deposited in the ncbis short read archive under the accession number sra <dig> figure  <dig>

functional annotation and classification
for the validation and annotation of the assembled unigenes, all the assembled unigenes were searched against the ncbi non-redundant  and swissprot protein databases using blastx program with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  among  <dig> unigenes  <dig>  were found similar with arabidopsis and  <dig>  unigenes were found similar with liliopsida. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were found in both databases, while  <dig>  unigenes were unidentified . based on nr annotations, we used the gene ontology  classification system to classify the possible functions of the unigenes. almost all the unigenes were successfully assigned to at least one go term annotation. the unigenes were then classified into three main categories, biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function .figure  <dig> 
histogram presentation of gene ontology classification. the results are summarized in three main categories, biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. the y-axis indicates the percentage of genes in a category, and the x-axis shows the number of genes. leaf and root tissue are marked with blue and red colour.



the category of biological processes  consisted of total  <dig> go terms, which were assigned to  <dig> unigenes. the cellular components  category consisted of total  <dig> go terms, which were assigned to  <dig> unigenes. the category of molecular functions  consisted of total  <dig> go terms, which were assigned to  <dig> unigenes. in leaf, for biological process, the top three largest categories were, “translation” , “response to cadmium ion” , and “response to salt stress” . for cellular components, the top three largest categories were, “integral to membrane” , “plasma membrane” , and “nucleus” . for molecular function, the top three largest categories were, “atp binding” , “structural constituents of ribosomes” , and “zinc ion binding” . in root, for biological process, the top three largest categories were, “transcription, dna dependent” , “proteolysis” , and “translation” . for cellular components, the top three largest categories were, “integral to membrane” , “nucleus” , and “plasma membrane” . for molecular function, the top three largest categories were, “atp binding” , “zinc ion binding” , and “dna binding”  .figure  <dig>

identification of simple sequence repeats  and their nature of repeat present in secondary metabolic pathway related genes
ssr markers are the most important molecular markers in plants and have proven to be a valuable tool for various applications in genetics and plant breeding. therefore, to develop a novel set of functional ssrs all of the  <dig> unigenes generated in this study were used to determine potential microsatellite motifs using microsatellite  software . total number of ssrs found in root tissues was more than ssrs found in leaf tissues.  <dig> ssrs in  <dig> sequences were recognized in leaf samples . root samples showed  <dig> ssrs in  <dig> sequences . number of sequences containing more than  <dig> ssr in leaf was  <dig> and in root was  <dig>  tri-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant ssr motif in leaf tissues followed by di-nucleotide, tetra-nucleotide, penta-nucleotide and hexa-nucleotide motifs  but in root tissues di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant ssr motif followed by tri-nucleotide, tetra-nucleotide, penta- nucleotide and hexa-nucleotide motifs . the number of compound ssrs presents in leaf and root samples were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. we have checked for the presence of these ssrs motifs in transcripts involved in steroidal sapogenin biosynthetic pathway. hmg co-a reductase shows both compound ssrs, mono and tri-nucleotide repeats at sequence level. in addition to this methylsterol monooxygenase and cycloartenol c- <dig> methyltransferases have mononucleotide repeats in its sequences on the other hand hmg-coa-synthase was found to have di-nucleotide repeat .

metabolic pathway analysis by kegg
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway database records the network of molecular interactions in the cells and variants of them specific to particular organisms. pathway-based analysis helps us to further understand the biological functions and interactions of genes. to further analyze the transcriptome of a. racemosus, all the unigenes were analyzed in kegg pathway database. first, based on a comparison against the kegg database using blastx with an e-value threshold of 10− <dig>   <dig> unigenes in leaf and  <dig> unigenes in roots were found to have significant matches in the database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways that are related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis . it was also observed that there were  <dig> unigenes in leaf sample and  <dig> unigenes in root sample, encoding enzymes that were involved in triterpenoid biosynthesis .

identification and upregulation of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes
precursor molecules for steroidal saponin biosynthesis belong to the terpenoid backbone, which utilizes isoprenoids synthesized via mevalonate as well as mep pathway. in our transcriptome data there were  <dig> unigenes in leaf and  <dig> unigenes in root, related to terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. almost all of the genes encoding the enzymes involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were present in our data. we have identified  <dig> enzymes  in root and  <dig> enzymes  in leaf related to mva pathway and  <dig> enzymes in root and  <dig> enzymes in leaf related to mevalonate pathway of terpenoid biosynthesis. in most cases, more than one unigenes were assigned to the same enzyme. such unigenes may represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both .

identification and expression analysis of transcripts related to steroidal sapogenin and their specific expression in root of asparagus racemosus
to identify genes with different expression levels in root as compared to leaf , initially we used the rpkm method  to calculate the expression levels of the unigenes. the log <dig> rpkm values were determined which range from less than  <dig>  to more than  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  for root and  <dig>  for leaf . fold change values were also given in addition to their rpkm values which indicated that most of the genes are expressed with a fold change value ranging between 2– <dig> . we used the ratio of rpkms to calculate the fold-change in the expression  of each gene in two samples simultaneously. we observed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts by digital gene expression analysis in which  <dig>  transcripts were up regulated in root with log  <dig> fold change value of more than  <dig> . after blast-x search of these root specific transcripts found to be up regulated in dge data, we obtained number of them to be functionally involved in steroidal saponin biosynthetic pathway, such as cytochrome p450s which showed a fold change value ranging between  <dig>  to  <dig> , methylsterol monooxygenases with a fold change value ranging between  <dig>  to  <dig>  and udp-glycosyltransferase with a fold change of  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> unigenes were identified to be involved in transcription, including dges  . these transcription factors were distributed to  <dig> families. some of the largest tf families identified in leaf and root tissues of a. racemosus were the ccaat-box binding transcription factors i.e. ccaat  <cit> , followed by the ap2-erebp family  <cit> , myb family  <cit> , wrky family  <cit> , c3h, hb  <cit> , snf <dig>  <cit> , orphans  <cit>  and nac  <cit>  transcription factor super family. digital gene expression of transcription factors in leaf and root tissues showed that  <dig> transcripts of myb superfamily followed by  <dig> transcripts of ap2-erebp and  <dig> transcripts of bhlh superfamily were highly upregulated in root .

to confirm that the unigenes from sequencing and computational analysis were indeed expressed and also to analyze the differential gene expression profile between leaf and root tissues, twenty seven unigenes from the above  <dig> root specific transcripts related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis were chosen for qrt-pcr analysis. all of these genes showed up regulation under control condition in root as compared to leaf control . among the highly expressed transcripts in our validation experiment are cytochrome p  <dig> 90b <dig> like protein , udp –glucosyltransferase , methylsterol monooxygenase , delta <dig> sterol c- <dig> desaturase  , cycloartenol-c-24-methyltransferase ,  <dig> hmg reductase , delta - sterol reductase  and cycloartenol synthase . the real time expression data further validated the presence of these twenty seven selected transcripts based on dge data for their specific expression in root tissue in comparison with leaf. out of above  <dig> transcript methylsterol monooxygenase, delta <dig> sterol c- <dig> desaturase, cycloartenol-c-24-methyltransferase,  <dig> hmg reductase, delta - sterol reductase, and cycloartenol synthase are involved in steroidal sapogenin biosynthetic pathway. modifications of saponins are shown to be important for their biological activity. we have also checked the level of identified udp glycosyltransferase which was found to be specifically present in root rather than leaf tissue .figure  <dig> 
validation of selected twenty seven up regulated transcripts in root as compared to leaf  by using qrt-pcr analysis. these all transcripts were related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. actin was used as the internal reference gene and the relative abundance of each gene transcript in roots and leaf tissue was compared. the data represents three independent biological and experimental replicates performed with standard deviations.



steroidal sapogenins are synthesized from cholesterol in several plants but not much information is available about biosynthetic pathways of steroid saponins and related metabolites apart from the knowledge that cholesterol and sitosterol are their cycloartenol-derived precursors. three pathways namely glycolytic pathway, mevalonate pathway and steroid biosynthesis pathway involved in steroidal saponin biosynthesis. integrating these three pathways we arrived at a conclusion that steroidal sapogenins may be formed from squalene  <dig>  3-oxide in two ways, either from lanosterol via the formation of cholesterol, or from cycloartenol via the formation of sitosterol. the enzymes involved in steroidal sapogenin biosynthesis that were found to be up regulated in root are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig> with their transcript id and ec numbers. in most cases, more than one unigenes were assigned to the same enzyme. such unigenes may represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both.

quantitative real-time pcr  analysis of saponin related gene transcripts in response to methyl jasmonate treatment
methyl jasmonate acts as an important elicitor, signaling molecule and also regulates the activity of various enzymes related to the secondary metabolic pathway. methyl jasmonate induces the saponin biosynthesis transcripts leading to increased accumulation of saponin. we have selected  <dig> transcripts from root, related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis specifically to saponin biosynthesis and checked their relative expression after  <dig>   <dig> and 12 hours of exogenous application of meja treatment in leaf and root tissues respectively . all the transcripts showed differential accumulation in response to meja at different time points. transcripts of thc-glucosyltransferase , udp- glycosyltransferase   <dig> a <dig> like and  <dig> glycosyltransferase  showed induced accumulation in root as well as in leaf while udp glycosyltransferase , 1- glucosyltransferase  and 47560- glucosyltransferase  showed induced accumulation only in leaf tissue after meja treatment . except cyp <dig> family transcript, rest of the transcript of cyp450s for example cyp <dig>  <dig> a1-like,  <dig> cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> 90-b <dig> like and cyp <dig>  <dig> d11-like transcripts showed increased accumulation in leaf only . anthocyanidin reductase showed induced accumulation in leaf tissue while in root there was no significant increase . delta  sterol reductase showed enhanced accumulation in leaf  while transcript of sterol 14-demethylase showed induced expression in leaf as well as in root but with a higher fold induction . the expression level of mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase in leaf is more than root  and the expression level of flavonol synthase is more in leaf than root .figure  <dig>

discussion
de novoassembly and functional annotation
a. racemosus is an important plant used for medicinal and ornamental purposes. despite pharmacological importance, the transcriptomic and genomic data of a. racemosus are very limited that are available in the national center of biotechnology information  database. in ncbi only  <dig> ests and  <dig> nucleotide sequences are available from a. racemosus
 <cit> . characterization of transcriptome is especially important for such a plant species which have a very large genome and present a great challenge for whole genome sequencing. due to the immense pharmacological importance of saponins found in roots of a. racemosus, de novo transcriptome analysis of leaf vs root tissue was done.

because of the development of an array of novel assembly methods, short read assembly has become cost-effective. with recent improvements in assembly programs that can effectively assemble relatively short reads, coupled with the great advantage of paired-end sequencing, the short read sequence data generated for transcriptomes or whole genomes have been assembled de novo very successfully for species such as maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , giant panda  <cit> , carrot  <cit> , rubber tree  <cit> , peanut  <cit>  safflower  <cit> , sweet potato  <cit> , etc. therefore, de novo sequencing and assembly of transcriptome or genome have been successfully used for model  <cit>  and non-model  <cit>  organisms. in this study, more than  <dig>  million high-quality reads were used to assemble the leaf and root transcriptome of a. racemosus. the assembly result indicated that the mean length of unigenes was 1200 bp, which was longer than the results shown in previous studies. we obtained more than 100% hq bases for both root and leaf samples which reflect the high quality sequencing run. low quality bases as well as the presence of adapters in reads could interfere with the assembly process resulting in misassemblies or truncated contigs. hence, low quality bases and adapter sequences were trimmed before proceeding with further analysis. these results suggested that the transcriptome sequencing data from a. racemosus were effectively assembled, which was further validated by the high proportion of unigenes matched with known proteins. the observed n <dig> value was higher which further suggests a better assembly.

the best hit for each unigene queried against the kegg and ncbi nr database was utilized to assign functional go annotation in terms of biological process, molecular function and cellular component groups. the large number of diverse go assignments to unigenes highlights the diversity of genes likely represented in asparagus leaf and root transcriptome data. mapping these unigenes on to kegg, we had identified large number of unigenes involved in biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites. the unigenes without hits probably belonged to untranslated regions, noncoding rna, short sequences not containing a protein domain or assembly mistakes. the functions of the identified genes cover various molecular function categories, and the well-represented categories included plasma membrane, integral membrane, nucleotide binding, structural component of ribosomes and nuclear proteins. the sequences encoded a broad set of transcripts represented within the cellular component category which indicates the need of a large number of transcripts for cellular structure and maintenance. on the basis of the annotation, we found the genes encoding all of the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of triterpenoid backbone, mostly in roots .

potential candidate genes involved in steroidal saponin biosynthesis
steroidal sapogenins are synthesized from cholesterol in several plants  <cit> , through isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. cytosolic isoprenoids are synthesized from acetyl coa through intermediate formations of mevalonate, isopentanyldiphosphate, dimethylallyldiphosphate, isopentenyl diphosphate, geranyldiphosphate, faresnyl diphospahte, squalene, cycloartenol and leads to steroidal sapogenin in broad view.

most of the known enzymes involved in the mva pathway for triterpene steroidal biosynthesis were found to be specifically expressing in root in comparision with leaf transcriptome of a. racemosus. previous studies reported that initial reactions of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway occur in the leaves, while later step modifications and storage of saponins occurs in the roots  <cit>  thus the amount of saponins is higher in roots. mevalonate is the key precursor for synthesis of cholesterol and related isoprenoid compounds. synthesis of mevalonate starts from acetyl coa. the conversion of acetyl coa to acetoacetyl coa and then to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa  by hmg co-a synthase  corresponds to the biosynthetic pathway for ketone bodies. in the next step, the 3-hmg group is cleaved from the coa and at the same time reduced to mevalonate with the help of , 3- hmg coa reductase which is the key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. a. racemosus transcriptome analysis has identified five different forms of 3-hmg coa reductase and it was found to be specifically expressing in root tissue. oxidosqualene which is formed by the action of the squalene epoxidase enzyme from squalene is the precursor in the biosynthesis of both triterpene and steroidal saponins in plant. we have identified two contigs showing homology with squalene epoxidase during transcriptome analysis, real time analysis further showed the specific expression of these two transcripts in root tissue only. from squalene upto steroidal sapogenin formation a total of  <dig> transcripts were identified from a. racemosus leaf and root transcriptome analysis .

methyl jasmonate treatment
methyl jasmonate plays critical roles in plant metabolism by up-regulating the expression of genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. we studied transcriptional changes in leaf and root tissues of a. racemosus after methyl jasmonate  treatment. in rt-pcr analysis transcripts of ugts and cyp <dig> involved in glycosylation and oxygenation steps respectively, have shown induced accumulation after the treatment. the upregulation of these enzymes in response to meja treatment may be due to the fact that mono-oxygenases that catalyze oxygenation reactions and glycosyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of sugar molecules to steroidal compounds may produce diverse saponins in different conditions  and control the activities of plants. similar stimulatory effects of meja on the biosynthetic pathway of other triterpenoid saponin compounds have already been reported  <cit> . it is also reported that transcripts encoding the key triterpene biosynthetic enzyme β-amyrin synthase increased up to 50-fold by introducing meja to cell suspension cultures of m. truncatula
 <cit> . it is known that jasmonic acid upregulates the expression of defense-related genes, so it may be possible that saponin biosynthesis is also related to plant defense responses  <cit> .

the increased expression of mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase, an important enzyme of mevalonate pathway of saponin biosynthesis, in leaf after meja treatment further supported the fact that initial reactions of isoprenoid biosynthesis occur in the leaves. the increased expression of these transcripts in response to meja showed that saponin biosynthesis may be increased when the plant recognizes certain signaling molecules  under stressed conditions. the identified transcripts involved in the steroidal biosynthetic pathway and their specific expression for root and leaf tissue in response to exogenous meja treatment is shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
schematic representation of the sapogenin biosynthetic pathway. enzymes were highlighted and marked according to their specific expression in root tissue along with their up regulation after exogenous meja application in a. racemosus. the relative expression of representative gene transcripts was represented in comparison to actin taken as an internal control.



CONCLUSIONS
the de novo transcriptome analysis of this very important indian medicinal ayurvedic herb brings out for the first time novel transcripts related to saponin biosynthesis which has anticancer and anti-oxidant properties. the knowledge of intermediate transcripts identified in this study their functional characterization at biochemical, cellular and molecular level will be useful to metabolically engineer and understand the saponin biosynthetic pathway and its regulation in plants.
