BACKGROUND
propionibacterium acnes is a gram positive rod normally found on human skin  <cit> , but has also been isolated from infections of orthopaedic implants  <cit> , and has been suggested to be involved in the development of acne vulgaris. recently, the first genome of a p. acnes strain was sequenced  <cit>  and several putative virulence factors were identified  <cit> . the sequenced p. acnes genome only contains one cryptic prophage, but it has earlier been shown that some p. acnes strains are carriers of inducible phages  <cit> . other groups have also studied propionibacterium phages both in order to establish a tool to differentiate between serotypes, but also to further characterize phages mainly infecting bacteria important for the dairy industry  <cit> .

recently, farrar et al, sequenced the first genome of a p. acnes phage, pa <dig>   <cit> . the genome consists of  <dig>  bp dsdna with  <dig> putative coding genes. the phage was determined to be a lytic phage since no integrase or repressor could be detected in the genome. eighteen of the genes were assigned predicted functions based on their similarities to other known phage genes. recently, we isolated and characterized inducible phages from p. acnes isolated from both deep infections and from skin of healthy individuals  <cit> . by comparing the genomes of these different phages, a better understanding of how the phage influences its host and an insight in the great genetic diversity seen among phages, as shown by other comparative studies on phage genomes can be achieved  <cit> .

phages can enter two principally different life cycles, e.g. a lytic life cycle or a lysogenic cycle. in the lysogenic cycle most phages integrate their genome into the host genome. this is most often regulated by a phage-borne integrase, but there is also a recent report of a filamentous phage, ctxÏ• from vibrio cholerae, that uses the host recombinases xerc and xerd to integrate into the host genome  <cit> . furthermore, there are a few phages known to form stable linear or circular plasmids as a part of their integration mechanism  <cit> , but most known temperate phages encode their own integrases.

other than those two well-defined phage life cycles, phages are also known to be able to interact with their host in other life cycles, termed as persistent infections, pseudolysogeny, carrier-state, and chronic infections  <cit> . those phage life cycles, even though common, are less defined compared to the lytic and lysogenic life cycles. common for all states, except the chronic infection, is that the bacteria carry the phage dna, but the dna is not integrated into the bacterial chromosome, but rather exists as a plasmid. the chronic infection is characterized by the release of phages from the bacteria without causing lysis  <cit> .

in this study, we have sequenced the genome of one phage induced from a p. acnes strain isolated from deep infection , and the genome of one phage induced from a p. acnes strain isolated from skin , and we have compared the two genomes with the reported lytic phage pa <dig>  <cit> . the phages have earlier been shown to have dissimilarities in the genes encoding a putative major head protein and an amidase  <cit> , but no other genes have been examined. this offers an opportunity to investigate if phages isolated from p. acnes contribute to the virulence seen in different strains of p. acnes, and to examine the genetic diversity seen among phages.

RESULTS
genomic organization and homology
the genomic organization of the three examined phages are very similar, even though some genes differ . both phages have a  <dig> bp ssdna extension at both ends of the genome, identical to that of phage pa <dig>  these extensions enable the formation of potential concatamers and circularization of the phage genome. the genome of pad <dig> is  <dig>  bp and has a gc content of  <dig> %, compared to the genome of pas <dig> that is  <dig>  bp and has a gc content of  <dig> %. pad <dig> has two larger deletions in the genome compared to pa <dig>  the first is a  <dig> bp deletion resulting in the deletion of the main part of gp <dig> and thereby in a frame shift giving rise to a combination of the gene products gp <dig> and gp <dig> . the second larger deletion is a  <dig> bp deletion of the entire gp <dig> gene. pas <dig> has two larger deletions and one insertion. the first deletion in pas <dig> is a  <dig> bp deletion resulting in the deletion of the gp <dig> gene, and a second deletion of almost  <dig> bp in a non-coding region, corresponding to bp  <dig> - <dig>  in pa <dig>  the insert in pas <dig> is an  <dig> bp insertion in gp <dig> resulting in a  <dig> amino acid larger exonuclease.

to further investigate the genomic organization of the different p. acnes phages, the genomes were screened for putative sigma70-dependent promoters and transcriptional terminators . several putative promoters were detected in all phages upstream of gp <dig>  gp <dig> and gp <dig>  as well as upstream of gp <dig> and gp <dig>  potentially enabling the phage to transcribe different parts of the genome at different stages of infection. one of the promoters with the highest score was upstream of a hitherto unannotated orf . however, the predicted gene product does not show any similarity to known sequences or domains.

the gp number represents the orf directly after the regulatory element. bold letters indicate the putative - <dig> and - <dig> site of the promoters, and the palindromes in the terminators. the score is given as -10/- <dig> for the promoters based on bprom as described in methods, and as minimal free energy  in kcal/mol for the terminators.

except for the six identified promoters in each genome, one putative transcriptional terminator was also identified . the putative terminators are placed immediately downstream of the amidase and the holin in the lysis gene cassette.

even though most of the genes are very similar in the examined phages, a certain pattern of similarity between gene clusters can be observed. packaging genes and putative head genes have a higher similarity between pad <dig> and pas <dig> than between the other examined p. acnes phage groups. other than the clusters mentioned above, gp27-gp <dig> also shows the highest similarity between pad <dig> and pas <dig>  except for gp <dig> and gp <dig>  this exception is mainly due to the deletion of gp <dig> in pad <dig>  furthermore, most tail genes and genes involved in the lysis of the host have the highest similarity between pa <dig> and pas <dig>  the overall genome nucleotide similarity is very high between all phages examined .

by searching for homologues corresponding to pad <dig> and pas <dig> proteins using blastp  <cit> , most hits were in the actinobacteria phylum, with streptomyces, mycobacterium and phages infecting mycobacterium, propionibacterium, nocardia, and bifidobacterium . this is not surprising since these species are closely related and thereby also might have similarities among their phages. most hits were on bacterial proteins, most likely indicating that these bacterial strains have prophages that have not yet been examined. more interestingly, several phage proteins showed similarity to phages isolated from low g+c bacteria as streptococcus and lactococcus . these species are not very closely related to p. acnes, but the results might indicate that their phages have had several possibilities to exchange genes. surprisingly, there were no hits on any other propionibacterium phages or prophages. if this merely reflects the lack of sequenced phages from propionibacteria and bacterial genomes in the propionibacterium genus, or indicate that phages isolated from p. acnes are distinct from those infecting other propionibacteria is unknown. furthermore, the putative cryptic prophage in p. acnes strain kpa <dig>  <cit>  does not show any similarity to pad <dig>  pas <dig> or pa <dig>  however, most recently, machuca et al  <cit>  isolated a phage infecting fusobacterium nucleatum. this phage was partially sequenced , and showed 90% sequence identity to parts of gp <dig>  and gp <dig> in pa <dig>  however, the whole phage genome of the fusobacterium phage needs to be sequenced to conclude how related this phage is to propionibacterium phages.

phage pad <dig> and pas <dig> protein sequences were screened for similar proteins using blast. all proteins showed the highest similarity to p. acnes phage pa <dig>  those hits were not further analyzed since they only indicate that the phages are most related to each other.

genes encoding packaging proteins and structural proteins
the packaging and structural proteins  are generally very well conserved, with high sequence similarities between all three phages, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % amino acid identity  with one exception - gp <dig>  gp <dig> has  <dig> % to  <dig> % amino acid identity and is predicted to function as a tail protein, with high similarity to collagen. this protein is likely to be involved in host specificity, so a more diverged gene would imply that the phages might have differences in host specificity. the difference in host specificity between pad <dig> and pas <dig> is however not very pronounced, since both pad <dig> and pas <dig> are equally potent to initiate lysis in most examined p. acnes isolates, even though some isolates can be used to differentiate the phages  <cit> . this does not rule out that a larger screen would detect more differences in host specificity and more clearly point out the genetic varieties that determine the host specificity.

another gene of particular interest is gp <dig> encoding a protein that has not yet been assigned a putative function. gp <dig> has a h-type lectin domain with e-values ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  in the phages examined. even though the e-values are rather low, they might still give an indication of the putative function. h-type lectins are known to interact with carbohydrates, and the genomic position of gp <dig>  close to genes encoding tail proteins, makes it possible that this protein is also a tail protein interacting with carbohydrates in order to bind to certain structures and potentially mediate a first binding site for the phage.

the lysis mechanism
all three phages encode an amidase, gp <dig>  with very high similarity to a p. acnes autolysin. they also encode a putative holin  with more pronounced sequence divergence. phage pa <dig> and pas <dig> have 94% amino acid identity in the holin protein, while pa <dig> and pad <dig> only have  <dig> % amino acid identity. interestingly, phage pad <dig> has a deletion in gp <dig> resulting in a mainly deleted gp <dig> and a new open reading frame encoding a protein with similarities to both gp <dig> and gp <dig> in pa <dig> . gp <dig> will not be fully translated in pas <dig> due to two internal stop codons.

identical proteins and putative virulence factors
several genes  encode identical amino acid sequences in pad <dig> and pas <dig>  but none of these proteins have predicted functions, nor any significant blastp hits, so these genes seem to be specific for p. acnes phages, and might, due to their sequence similarity be a good tool to use in phylogenetic analyses of phages isolated from p. acnes. gp <dig>  a gene in pa <dig>  is absent in both pad <dig> and pas <dig>  but another orf in the same region  exists in all three phages and might thereby be more likely to be a true coding gene. however, none of the putative gp <dig>  genes have similarities to other genes, neither has gp <dig> in pa <dig> 

some proteins did get blast hits indicating that the proteins could be putative virulence factors. among those are gp <dig> that is annotated as a dna helicase due to a dnab helicase domain . more interesting, this protein also has a multidrug resistance protein-like transporter domain . this domain is less pronounced in pas <dig>  and pa <dig> . pas <dig> also has a weak hit  in gp <dig> on a hyaluronidase. however, due to the low similarities to other proteins, and thereby the low e-values, we can not assign a function to the phage proteins based on the similarities to other domains, only determine which domains they are most similar to.

the phages might also be able to circularize and form concatamers due to the ssdna extensions on each side of the genome. when circularized, a new putative gene  can be transcribed. this gene encodes a protein with some similarity to different nucleoproteins from ebola virus, and has a topoisomerase ii-associated protein pat- <dig> domain . thus, this gene can only be transcribed when the phage has circularized and potentially integrated, or formed concatamers.

identification of phage proteins
to verify that some of the genes encoded proteins, pad <dig> was precipitated with peg  <dig>  the proteins were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, and then analyzed with ms/ms. all visible bands but band f were identified . one of the bands, band e, was identified as a p. acnes succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit, thus indicating that this protein exists as a large complex, thereby being eluted in the same fractions as the whole phage particles during the fplc gel filtration. other than the p. acnes flavoprotein, all proteins were identified as phage proteins. bands a-d were all identified as the major head protein of pad <dig> , which has a calculated molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda. however, the bands a-d have a much higher molecular weight, starting from approximately  <dig> kda for band d, reaching over  <dig> kda for band a. interestingly, we did not get any other hits on the major head protein with lower molecular mass proteins, indicating that these proteins tend to form complexes of 6- <dig> monomers, based on the apparent molecular weight, that are not disrupted even when boiling the samples with sds and reducing agents. a similar phenomenon has been described before with the enterobacteria phage hk <dig>  which has complexes of covalent linked major head proteins, and not a single major head protein exist as a monomer  <cit> . both the n-and c-terminal part of the major head protein were covered, showing that this protein is not processed after its translation, as some major head proteins require in order to establish their final conformation.

other proteins that were identified were gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig>  gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  is close to the theoretical molecular weight . thus, all phage proteins identified seem to be structural proteins, dominated by gp <dig>  and gp <dig> .

phage life cycle
the phages used in this study were originally isolated by mitomycin c treatment of p. acnes isolates. however, those phages were able to infect their host strains, and thus did not confer superinfection immunity  <cit> . this data made us conclude that the phages were lysogenic. a similar phenomenon has been reported for leuconostoc oenos phages, where more than 65% of the bacterial isolates could be induced with mitomycin c and where the phages were able to infect their host strains  <cit> .

to further investigate how stable the interaction between the p. acnes phages and the bacterium was, we performed ten serial single-colony isolations and then screened for phages using a pcr assay. all examined colonies had been cured from phages , indicating that the phages are not true lysogens. this ability to cure the bacterial isolates from phages suggests that the interaction between the phage and bacterium rather might be pseudolysogenic  <cit> . the inability to cure bacteria from phages was one of the criteria used to determine that phages from the p. acnes related bacterium nocardia erythropolis were lysogenic, due to that the spontaneous curing of phages was less than  <dig> % after  <dig> serial single-colony isolations  <cit> . these phages were also induced with mitomycin c, but they all showed superinfection immunity. it has also been shown in several experiments that the environment may influence the virus-host interaction. this is evident in the case of phages infecting the archeal species halobacterium, where the nacl concentration determines if the phages enter a lytic cycle, or cause a persisting infection. at low nacl concentration, the phages effectively kill the host, while at higher concentrations of nacl the lysis is delayed for several bacterial generations  <cit> , leading to a persistent infection.

to further investigate if p. acnes might harbour pseudolysogenic phages, single colonies from the p. acnes isolates ad <dig> and as <dig> were inoculated into bhi broth and different parameters such as od <dig> and pfu were measured two times a day . no free infectious phages were detected at any time point, indicating that if any phages were spontaneously induced, their number have not exceeded the detection limit of  <dig> pfu/ml. however, at time points corresponding to mid-log phase and late-log phase, both ad <dig> and as <dig> had 10-60% colonies harbouring phage dna, as judged by pcr amplification of the major head gene . however, this carriage of phages is lost during the stationary growth phase, thus indicating that the phage dna is not being replicated at this time point. furthermore, the cells at the various time points were sensitive to pad <dig> and pas <dig> infection, indicating that the loss of phages were not due to the development of resistance . this implies that the phages are not strictly lytic, neither strictly lysogenic.

much of the data indicates that the p. acnes phages might have a pseudolysogenic cycle, which is also supported by the genetic information. there are no genes on the phage genomes with similarities to known integrases or repressors. it is, however, known that certain filamentous phages can integrate their genomes using host recombinases  <cit> . however, when extracting p. acnes chromosomal dna, phage dna is lost, as judged by the absence of a positive pcr reaction for the phage major head gene , indicating that the phage indeed does not integrate. thus, it seems like p. acnes phages can persist as extra-chromosomal plasmids, however when in this state, they are not replicating, since they easily are cured after  <dig> serial single-colony isolations.

phage phylogenetic analysis
bacteriophages can be divided into different groups based on different criteria as host range, morphology and genetic material. earlier attempts to classify phages according to their proteome have been conducted by rohwer et al using  <dig> phage genomes  <cit> . we aligned  <dig> bacteriophage genomes, including pad <dig> and pas <dig>  using the progressive mauve algorithm  <cit>  in order to investigate how the p. acnes phages were related to other phages. mauve recognizes conserved nucleotide segments in the genomes, but has the advantage that it can rearrange the order of these segments, thereby also identifying genome rearrangements  <cit> . however, mauve has several limitations when it comes to comparing several diverged phage genomes, due to that mauve works best with related organisms, and can not identify conserved regions shared only by a fraction of the genomes. thus, aligning the genomes using mauve will not generate a reliable phylogenetic tree. instead, we used the progressive mauve algorithm, which is developed to be able to align more diverged genomes with less than 50% nucleotide identity. our results are in good agreement with the results obtained by rohwer et al, but some of the phages are placed differentially. the sk1-like siphoviruses with lactococcus phage sk <dig> and phage c <dig> form two closely related lineages, and also the lambda-like siphoviruses align in a similar way as rohwer et al. however, lactococcus phage r1t is more closely related to lactococcus phage tuc <dig> and tpp901- <dig> in our alignment than was showed previously. furthermore, acinetobacter phage ap <dig> is not as diverged from the other leviphages in our model as rohwer shows. other than that, most phages cluster in the same groups as was shown by rohwer et al, even though we have several more phages and subgroups of phages, resulting in not as distinct groupings as in rohwer's model. we found that the p. acnes phage genomes sequenced so far form a new phylogenetic lineage, well separated from other phages, with no close relatives . furthermore, the different families of phages are widely distributed over all classes of bacteria, with siphoviruses being the most abundant family reported in the database. remarkably, even though pad <dig> and pas <dig> have a morphology that classifies them as siphoviruses, some of their closest related phages are propionibacterium freudenreichii phage b <dig> , acinetobacter phage ap <dig>  and pseudomonas phage phi <dig> segment l . furthermore, a group of podoviruses including yersinia phage berlin seem to be closely related to a group of myoviruses with vibrio, aeromonas and enterobacteria phages. also of interest is that most phages infecting mycobacterium and streptomyces were rather closely related to phages from propionibacterium. this is not surprising, since the bacterial hosts also are related. of more interest is that proteobacteria such as pseudomonas, burkholderia and ralstonia phages also were related to phages infecting the actinobacteria phylum, while other proteobacteria as vibrio and salmonella were not. other than that, bacterial families tend to have closely related phages, even though the classification of the phage families can differ in a bacterial species, as the very closely related mycobacterium phage rizal and rosebush, that are classified as a myovirus and a siphovirus, respectively. thus, this clearly shows that classification of phages solely based on morphology is not sufficient to determine to which family a phage should be assigned, but that genomic data is also necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that phages isolated from p. acnes are highly similar and show high nucleotide sequence identity. several of the phage structural proteins were identified using maldi-tof ms/ms. the sequenced phages do not seem to encode any putative virulence factors. finally we could show that the phages seem to be able to cause pseudolysogeny in their hosts.
