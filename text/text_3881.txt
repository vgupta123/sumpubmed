BACKGROUND
site-selective adenosine to inosine  rna-editing is an essential post-transcriptional mechanism for expanding the proteomic repertoire. it is carried out by members of the double-stranded rna-specific adar family predominantly acting on precursor messenger rnas  <cit> . as inosines in mrna are recognized as guanosines  by the ribosome in the course of translation, rna-editing may lead to a codon exchange resulting in a modified protein. adar-mediated rna editing is essential for the development and normal life of both invertebrates and vertebrates  <cit> . additionally, altered editing patterns have been found to be associated with various diseases including inflammation  <cit> , sle  <cit> , epilepsy  <cit> , depression  <cit> , als  <cit>  and malignant brain tumors such as gliomas and astrocytomas  <cit> . a-to-i editing affects numerous sites in the human transcriptome, most of which are located in alu elements within untranslated regions  <cit> . alu is a retrotransposon, about  <dig> bp long, belonging to the class of short interspersed nuclear elements . more than one million copies, are present in the human genome, comprising 10% of the whole genome mass  <cit> . the precise role of rna editing in alu repeats is yet a mystery. however, it might affect gene expression through a number of mechanisms  <cit> : as inosine pairs with cytosine, editing influence the stability of rna molecules by creating and disrupting secondary structures. at another level, since inosine is recognized as guanosine by the splicing machinery a-i editing can lead to modification of splice sites in introns, inducing premature termination, frame-shift, or new exon formation  <cit> .

consistent levels of a-to-i rna-editing across human individuals were previously observed in a few recoding sites, mainly glutamate receptors  <cit> . however, the variability of the editing level among different human individuals has so far not been studied for neither most recoding editing targets nor the abundant alu editing. low variance of the editing level indicates a tight regulation and might attest to the functional importance of the specific editing event.

to test this, we studied the variability in editing levels across different human individuals and a variety of tissues, genes and sites.

RESULTS
editing levels are consistent among skin samples of human individuals both in coding and non-coding sequences
in healthy brain tissue, editing levels for the recoding sites within the glutamate receptor are highly uniform across individuals  <cit> . as a first step, we tested whether the same is true for other editing sites occurring within coding sequences expressed in other tissues.

first, we investigated  <dig> skin samples. although mice adar <dig> or adar <dig> knockout die in-utero or shortly after birth, rna editing is implicated as relevant to the skin in humans by the observation that mutations in adar <dig> lead to dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria  <cit> , a pigmenting genodermatosis with an autosomal dominant inheritance reported predominantly in japanese and chinese individuals  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the effect of these mutations on adar <dig> function or editing pattern has not been found.

we looked at a-to-i editing levels in three recently discovered, mouse-conserved, targets within coding sequences: flna, cyfip <dig> and blcap  <cit> . filamin a  displays an a→i editing site in its transcript , resulting in a q→r substitution at amino acid  <dig> in the human protein. the cyfip <dig>  transcript encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids, and undergoes a→i editing  at chromosome 5: <dig> , <dig>  resulting in k→e substitution at amino acid  <dig>  blcap , is highly conserved among species, having 91% and 100% identity at the dna  and protein levels, and is recoded by editing. here, we tested one editing site in the nucleotide encoding the second codon of blcap, located at chromosome 20: <dig> , <dig>  resulting in a y→c substitution. sequenome analysis for rna editing  <cit>  has shown an average editing level of  <dig>   <dig> and 14% for flna, cyfip <dig> and blcap, respectively, in the skin samples. remarkably, in all three genes, we observed a comparable level of editing for the  <dig> individuals, as mirrored by the low standard deviations - in all three sites the standard-deviation of the editing levels across individuals is about 1/ <dig> of their averaged editing level . these finding suggested that the protein diversity derived from editing is tightly regulated in these targets. editing levels of flna and cyfip <dig> in skin were lower than the values reported for normal brain tissue, while in blcap, the level was comparable to the one in normal brain tissue, oral cavity and lung  <cit> . this observation is consistent with previous reports suggesting that blcap is edited  only by adar <dig>  while the other two sites are edited by both adars or by adar <dig> alone  <cit> .

next, we tested the variability in editing levels of non-recoding sites. in particular, we focused on editing targets within the primate-specific alu repeats which constitute the vast majority of editing sites in the human genome. in this category we looked at a single editing site in  <dig> targets selected from the rna editing database  <cit> : fyn ), card <dig> , and klrd <dig> . using sequenom analysis of the above  <dig> skin samples, we found low average editing levels in these sites,  <dig>   <dig>  and 3%  for fyn, klrd <dig> and card <dig>  respectively . in order to quantify the degree of consistency among individuals, we compared the individual editing levels of the  <dig> different sites in the flna, cyfip <dig>  blcap, klrd <dig>  card <dig> and fyn genes. a statistically significant difference  between editing levels of the different sites was observed for  <dig> out of the  <dig> pairs of editing sites tested . we therefore conclude that the variation of results across individuals is significantly lower than the difference in editing efficiency between different sites .

most editing sites in the human transcriptome occur in clusters where a number of nearby sites undergo editing. therefore, the question arises whether editing regulation occurs at the cluster level or at the site level. that is, whether regulation is able to distinct editing sites residing in the same highly-edited region. to answer this question, we direct sequenced an alu repeat within the last intron of the fyn gene for  <dig> different human skin samples and analyzed  <dig> different editing sites in this region . twenty two of the samples resulted in high-quality sequence data. distinct editing levels were found for the  <dig> sites . mann-whitney analysis showed the editing levels of different sites to be distinct:  <dig> out of  <dig> comparisons resulted in a significant  difference. anova analysis resulted in f-ratio  <dig>  , demonstrating that the difference in editing efficiency among various sites in the same alu repeat is an order of magnitude larger than variability in editing efficiency of specific sites across individuals.

comparison of editing levels in different tissues
it is established that editing levels are particularly high in some tissues, including the brain  <cit> . this can be attributed to the elevated level of adar <dig> in the brain. here we aim at comparing the editing levels in a number of non-brain tissues. for this purpose we analyzed editing data  <cit>  for clusters of editing sites in the 3'utr alu sequences of  <dig> different genes: mdm <dig>  nrip <dig> and thoc <dig>  in the following tissues: lung, kidney, prostate, uterus, liver and glioma tumor . we found low variability among different tissues and a clear distinction between different editing sites of the  <dig> genes. that is, given the six values of editing levels in the six non-brain tissues, for two different sites within the same alu repeat, the tissue-to-tissue variance is low enough to allow one to tell  that the two sets of six measurements describe two sites differing in their editing efficiency. the tissue-to-tissue similarity is high enough to allow pair-wise distinction between different sites in a cluster in 51/ <dig>  148/ <dig> and 50/ <dig> of the pairs, in mdm <dig>  nrip <dig> and thoc <dig>  respectively . anova analysis yielded f-ratios  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   for mdm <dig>  nrip <dig> and thoc <dig>  respectively, again showing that the tissue-to-tissue variability is an order of magnitude lower than the site-to-site variability within the same cluster. the standard-deviation to mean ratio is  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mdm <dig>  nrip <dig> and thoc <dig> .

regulated editing events might be recruited for functional processes. as an example, we studied the alu editing in the narf gene. in this gene, insertion of alu retrotransposon pair into an intron led to editing of the alu repeats, which in turn created a novel primate-specific alternatively spliced exon  <cit> . we looked at the tissue-to-tissue consistency of the editing levels in  <dig> different sites within this alu using the data published by lev-maor et al  <cit> . in concordance with our previous data, the editing levels of narf were highly consistent among different human tissues including transformed and cancerous human cell lines : statistically significant difference  was observed in 9/ <dig> comparisons . anova analysis yields an f-ratio  <dig>  , demonstrating once more the individual to individual scatter to be much lower than editing-efficiency variability.

discussion
our findings demonstrate that editing levels display low variability among different human individuals not only in coding but also in the non-coding, non-conserved, alu sequences.

rna editing of several evolutionary-conserved recoding sites is known to be of critical importance to proper cell development and function. altered editing patterns in these sites are associated with severe phenotypes  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising to find that editing levels in these sites are uniform among individuals, suggesting tight regulation as one would expect. the three newly discovered recoding sites considered in this work are also extremely well evolutionary conserved, and it is thus reasonable to believe that they also have a critical role, yet to be explored. consistently, we found that they also all have low variability of editing levels.

virtually all a-to-i editing events in primates occur in the primate-specific alu repeats, and are therefore not conserved among many species. the biological importance of these sites, if any, is yet to be shown. we therefore tested the consistency of editing levels in these sites in order to obtain a hint as to their potential role. editing events of sites with highly variable levels among individuals are unlikely to serve as an important link in a chain of events being part of a biological pathway. the other side of the coin is that sites whose editing exhibit a consistent pattern in terms of editing levels might have been recruited in the course of evolution to serve a functional role. surprisingly, we found that editing levels in sites with alu repeats do present us with such consistent patterns. the variability among sites, including neighboring ones, is very high: where some sites show an extremely low level of a few percent, neighboring sites could be edited up to 60-80%. yet, these seemingly fluctuating patterns are actually consistent among individuals - strong sites are strong in all samples and weak site are weak in all samples.

as all sites are edited by the same adar enzymes, what could be the mechanism providing the wide range of efficiencies on one hand, together with significant consistency on the other? we propose that a to i editing is subjected to two levels of control - adar expression and structural patterns of the dsrna. the essential adars enzymes are expected to be tightly regulated to have consistent levels among different individuals. indeed, it was found that editing enzymes are tightly regulated during development  <cit> . here too, we found adar <dig> levels to be consistent, in most cases, between different individuals, supporting this assumption . therefore, although the relation between editing levels and adars expression is probably not a simple linear one  <cit> , it is likely that adar expression controls editing level. however, given a certain level of the adar enzymes, it seems likely that sequence and structural differences between sites determine their editing efficiency relative to other sites. the sequence and the resulting dsrna structure formed by alu, vary significantly from site to site, but are shared by all samples. sequence analysis  <cit> of editing sites revealed a number of weak motifs. however, these alone cannot account for the observed tightly-regulated editing profiles. it is therefore plausible that structural motifs may take a role and should be analyzed as well.

the massive expansion of the alu repeats in the primate genome has increased by order of magnitudes the amount of a-to-i editing in their transcriptome. the above analysis suggests that this phenomenon provided the primates with thousands of well-controlled and consistent transcriptomic "switches" that can be utilized for biological functions. it is not clear how many of these were actually adopted. one distinct example is the adoption of editing site in the narf gene to create a new editing-assisted splicing event, resulting in a whole-new primate-specific alternatively-spliced exon  <cit> . the surprising consistency shown in editing of arbitrarily chosen sites within alu's tantalizes us to wonder whether this mechanism of increasing diversification by creating new editing-assisted splicing events, could be more widespread. of particular interest are mirna target sites within alu repeats  <cit> , where one can clearly see how regulated control over single nucleotides might result in an efficient mechanism affecting the translation rate of the harboring gene.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we show that editing events within alu sequences exhibit a consistent pattern of editing levels across individuals. this might be attributed to sequence and structural motifs controlling the editing efficiency. therefore, alu intervention in the genome provides the primates with thousands of well controlled binary transcriptomic switches  <cit> , available for use as additional regulatory mechanisms. evidence for sporadic use of these switches already exists, but it is yet unclear how widespread this phenomenon is. as a-to-i editing is most abundant in the brain, the fascinating question than arises whether the above-mentioned mechanism might have played a role in primates' brain evolution.
