BACKGROUND
calmodulin  is a multisite and multifunctional protein that contains four ef-hand ca2+ binding sites  <cit> , and is involved in a wide variety of cellular functions  <cit> . for example, it regulates the concentration of intracellular camp concentration in a very complex manner by regulating activities of camp producing adenylate cyclases  and camp hydrolysing enzyme phosphodiesterase . cam also regulates a large number of kinases and phosphatases as well as other enzymes with opposing cellular effects. despite a large number of experimental studies  <cit> , the detailed mechanisms underlying cam-dependent intracellular regulation of such a large variety of target proteins are still not fully understood.

previous investigations of cam structures in complexes with target protein peptides have led to the view that the specificity in cam-dependent target activation arises from the diversity of interaction interfaces between cam and its target proteins  <cit> . there are two globular domains in cam, each containing a pair of helix-loop-helix ca2+-binding motifs called ef-hands . ca2+ binding alters cam conformation  and changes its affinity to target proteins. the four helix-loop-helix ef-hand ca2+-binding sites  are also capable of binding intracellular calcium's physiologically inactive competitor mg2+   <cit> . the best known canonical binding mode of cam interaction with a target is the "wrap-around" in which both n- and c-terminal domains of cam bind to the same target protein region. this interaction is exemplified by a cam structure in complex with the protein kinase kinase peptide  <cit>  shown in figure 1e. a variation of the wrap-around cam binding interaction has been shown to occur with the brain specific pkc substrate cap-23/nap- <dig>  <cit> . examples of the so-called "extended" mode of interaction include anthrax exotoxin, edema factor  <cit>  and ca2+ pump  <cit> . the extended mode of interaction is proposed to occur in target binding to apo-cam via the iq motif  <cit>  . cam-induced target dimerization has been reported as having another distinctly different binding mode. the dimerization of ca2+-dependent k+ channels is achieved by adopting the extended conformation of the ef-hand domains of cam protein  <cit> . two other reported examples of cam target proteins dimerizing upon interaction are the glutamate decarboxylase   <cit>  and transcription factor sef2-1/e2- <dig>  <cit> .

recent experimental studies have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ca2+/cam-dependent target regulation by measuring the kinetics and steady-state levels of cam-target binding  <cit>  as well as by analysing the mechanisms of ca2+-cam interactions  <cit> . ca2+ ion binding to ef-hand sites was shown to lead to cam conformational alterations  <cit> . in the modified conformational state, cam is likely to alter its affinity to different targets by increasing and decreasing its affinity to certain proteins. ca2+ ion binding to cam is also argued to positively modulate the affinity of other ca2+ binding sites of the molecule. there is still, however, an ongoing debate about the existence, the mechanisms and the degree of cooperativity in ca2+-cam interactions. in some studies, ca2+ binding to cam has been reported to be independent  <cit> . on the other hand, other studies have reported cooperative interactions between the neighbouring ef-hand binding sites  <cit>  or cooperativity linking all sites of the cam molecule  <cit> .

a number of previous studies have attempted to use mathematical modelling to obtain a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms involved in ca2+-cam interactions. different mathematical models, including the well known hill  <cit> , adair  <cit>  and monod-wyman-changeux   <cit>  models, have been used in the literature to describe the cooperativity of ligand binding to a multisite protein. the hill equation is frequently used to qualitatively measure the degree of cooperativity in multisite binding. it describes the simultaneous binding of n ligand molecules to a protein where the parameter n can be interpreted as the number of bound molecules. the adair model represents ligand-protein interactions in terms of successive binding steps. the mwc model is based on two conformations that are in equilibrium and have different affinities for a ligand. to date, the hill and adair models have been most frequently used to investigate ca2+ binding to cam  <cit> . while these studies have provided much useful information, the use of the classical models mentioned above also introduces some limitations in the analysis â€“ see  <cit>  for a full discussion of this issue. in particular, the detailed analysis of ligand-protein interactions which are unique to cam requires the development of a model that captures multiple functionally important intermediate conformations of the protein. a steady-state solution to the cooperativity problem for ca2+ binding has been analysed in  <cit> . in this paper, we develop a new model, based on the assumption that the specificity in cam target regulation arises from the ca2+-cam complex specific target interactions with variable numbers of bound ca2+ ions. in this approach, ca2+ binding to each ef-hand sites causes conformational transitions in the cam molecule leading to a model that has multiple conformational states in complex with variable numbers of ca2+ ions. in the proposed model, cam may regulate its targets with one, two or three ca2+ ions as well as in the apo- or fully bound states. in particular, we address the ca2+-cam interaction in significant detail, although we do not incorporate detailed ca2+-cam species interactions with target proteins. this approach is in agreement with recent experimental evidence that the concentration-dependent profiles for several ca2+-cam-dependent protein targets exhibit quite a diverse range of behaviour. pmca and pde protein concentrations in the active state, for example, reveal "hill-shape"-like curves, whereas the acii isoform is inhibited by increasing ca2+ concentration. the acvi isoform exhibits inhibition with an interesting plateau feature on the ca2+-dependent profile. yet aci isoforms have bell-shaped concentration-dependent profiles  <cit> . it has also been shown that campkii  <cit>  as well as the k+ channel from paramecium  <cit>  are activated by cam with two bound ca2+ ions.

the structural systems biology approach,  <cit> , employed in this paper provides new insights into the ca2+-cam-target binding dose-response curves which have been derived experimentally, and allows us to advance testable hypotheses about the nature of cooperative mechanisms unique to calcium-cam interactions. the resulting analysis further bridges the gap between our understanding of cam structural properties and intracellular ca2+-cam-dependent target regulation.

RESULTS
multisite binding of cooperatively linked binding centres
perhaps one of the most intriguing questions about the intracellular function of cam is the mechanism and consequences of ef-hand ca2+ binding site influences leading to cooperative effects. the structure of the cam molecule  has a "dumbbell" shape with two globular domains, each containing two ef-hand ca2+ binding sites located in the vicinity of each other. these neighboring sites are very likely to structurally influence each other upon ca2+ binding to one of them. on the other hand, there does not seem to be a direct mechanism to "transfer" the structural alterations between the n- and c-terminal binding sites upon ion binding. it is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the ef-hand ca2+ binding sites on cam are subject to pairwise influence. in order to explore how cooperative mechanisms and cam-target protein interactions influence ca2+ binding to cam, we developed three models with increasing levels of complexity  that are illustrated schematically in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. model  <dig> disregards the cooperativity between the ca2+ binding sites . model  <dig> is an intermediate model which extends the previous representation by introducing the cooperative dependence of one site on another in each domain. a comparison of the concentration profiles generated by model  <dig> and model  <dig> clearly reveals the impact of cooperativity on ca2+ binding to cam. however, model  <dig> is still incomplete as it does not capture the reverse or symmetrical cooperative dependence, when one ca2+ binding site cooperatively influences another, and another site can in the same way influence the first site, within both terminals. to address this issue, a third model, model  <dig>  is developed to incorporate described cooperative influence of ef-hand ca2+ binding sites .

in order to investigate the dependence of one ca2+ binding site on another in both the n- and c-terminal domains, we assumed the alteration of a dissociation constant when a neighboring site is occupied as illustrated schematically in figure  <dig> . this approximation allows the derivation of a model that has an analytical solution in the form of conditional probabilities . it provides a quantitative comparison of the concentration of ca2+ bound to cam in the presence and absence of ca2+ binding site cooperative interactions . figure 5a shows the model predictions in the case where cam is assumed to have two pairs of independent ef-hand globular domains. within these domains, one ca2+ binding site influences the other. in the n-terminal domain, the affinity of the second site depends on the state of the first and changes from k <dig> =  <dig>  to k2coop =  <dig>   when a ca2+ ion occupies the first centre. in the c-terminal, the affinity of the fourth site depends on the state of the third and changes from k <dig> =  <dig>  to k4coop =  <dig>   when a ca2+ ion occupies the third centre. the model  predicts that such changes will mainly influence the "amplitudes" of the intermediate conformations of the concentration-dependent profiles while leaving the ligand concentrations that produce their maximum values largely unchanged. figure 5b shows the difference in the total amount of bound ligand with and without the type of cooperativity described above. since the amount of bound ca2+ is frequently measured in ca2+-cam or other ligand-multisite protein interaction experiments, these results allow a direct quantitative comparison to be made of the binding reactions with and without the presence of cooperative binding.

n- and c-terminal domains reveal unique cooperative properties
a more realistic description for ef-hand ca2+ binding sites would involve the incorporation of the influence of both ca2+ binding sites on each other within the cam globular domains as schematically illustrated on figure  <dig> . the resulting system of differential equations describing the ca2+-cam interactions is given by  in materials and methods. the model based on these assumptions leads to some interesting predictions regarding ca2+-dependent cam interactions with various cam target protein peptides  <cit>  and reveals a complex story of specificity in cam regulation. while it is well established that ca2+ ions are required to modulate the cam-target protein interactions, the mechanism of ca2+-induced cam conformational transitions that allow selective interactions with a particular target protein is still unclear. the presented model for ca2+ binding to cam provides new insights into how the cooperative interactions between ef-hand binding sites contribute to the mechanism of selective target regulation by cam, as described below.

to analyse the pairwise cooperativity between the ef-hand binding sites of the n- and c- terminals of cam, our model has been applied to the experiments on ca2+ binding to tryptic fragments of cam. here, the conditional probabilities for ef-hand ca2+ binding sites to be free or occupied corresponding to detailed pairwise cooperative mechanisms in the n- and c-terminal domain of cam are used. two dissociation constants are introduced for the ef-hand binding sites, k <dig> and kc <dig>  the dissociation constant for the binding centres changes from k <dig> to kc <dig> when a neighbouring ca2+ binding loop becomes occupied by a ca2+ ion in either the n- or c- terminal domain of the cam molecule. the comparison of the model predictions with the experimental results  reveals that the ca2+ binding sites of both n-  and c- terminals  have similar dissociation constants k <dig>  however, the c- terminal exhibited much higher affinity for a cooperatively influenced binding site . figure 6d shows the amount of ca2+ bound to full length cam while figure 6e shows the corresponding the scatchard plot. the dissociation constants shown are the pre- and post-occupied k <dig> and k <dig> dissociation constants for the ca2+ binding sites in n- and c-terminal domains. it, therefore, appears possible that the n- and c- terminals of cam can be distinguished based on the unique sets of cooperativity-dependent dissociation constants rather than by the absolute dissociation constants. it is important to notice that this analysis concentrated on differences in the ca2+-cam dissociation constants and did not consider the differences in dissociation constants between intermediate ca2+-cam complexes and target proteins. the incorporation of this additional important parameter would serve to further improve the description of the ca2+-cam-dependent regulation.

calmodulin-target interactions reveal target-specific cooperativity in ca2+ binding
a critical aspect of ca2+-cam-target complex formation is the order of the assembly and the alterations of macroscopic dissociation constants for ca2+ at individual sites, depending on whether cam is bound to the target protein. the current model has been applied to the dose-response curves for ca2+-cam-target peptide complexes in an attempt to distinguish the following details: i) the sets of cooperative dissociation constants for the n- and c-terminal domains of cam, ii) the sequence of ca2+-cam-target  complex assembly, iii) the contribution of ca2+ unsaturated cam conformation species. to obtain insights into these questions, the model predictions for the dose-response curves of these peptides were compared with the experimentally established ca2+ concentration-dependent profiles from  <cit>  and  <cit> . while fitting the model predictions to the experimental data from  <cit>  we assumed that cam may bind target proteins with different numbers of bound ca2+ ions or even in the ca2+ free state. figure  <dig> shows the ca2+-dependent profiles of ca2+-cam and ca2+-cam in complex with peptides derived from phosphorylase kinase , erythrocyte ca2+-atpase and skeletal myosin light chain kinase  , ca2+-cam bound to half length peptides sk-c <dig> and sk-n <dig> of skmlck , ca2+-cam bound to half length peptides n <dig> and n <dig> of caatpase , and camkii and campii-cbp peptide . the model predictions in comparison with the experimental data suggest that it is possible that all conformations may have their own k <dig> and k <dig> dissociation constants. the target proteins may interact with a specific ca2+-cam complex or with a combination of cam conformations with a unique number of ca2+ ions. it also appears plausible that ca2+ binding sites on cam have different affinities for ca2+ ions, depending on whether cam-target or ca2+-cam binding occurs first, in addition to pairwise cooperativity between ca2+ binding sites.

the results of the present study, when combined with previous experimental data from the literature, suggest that cam interacts with phosphorylase kinase, caatpase and skmlck in the apo state, but activates these proteins only when ca2+ ions bind to a cam-target protein complex. camkii kinase, on the other hand, binds to the ca2+-cam complex rather than apo-cam. each kinase has a unique combination of k <dig> and k <dig> dissociation constants. the half length peptides of caatpase and skmlck appear to have an even more complex mechanism of binding. as mentioned earlier, each ca2+-cam complex  may have a unique set of k <dig> and k <dig> constants for a target protein or peptide. for simplicity, all possible cam species were divided into two groups: i) those with less than  <dig> ca2+ ions bound and ii) those with three and four ca2+ ions bound to cam. a comparison of the model predictions with the ca2+-cam-parts of skmlck and caatpase peptide binding data  suggests that both the k <dig> and the cooperatively influenced k <dig> dissociation constants are different when peptides are bound to cam species with less than  <dig> ca2+ ions or to cam species with  <dig> or  <dig> ions. the conclusion from this observation is that the specificity in ca2+-cam-dependent regulation arises from a combination of the target specific affinity between ca2+ and cam, target specific cooperative constants, the order of the ca2+-cam-target complex assembly, as well as the number of ca2+ ions bound to cam. all these factors contribute to the mechanism of selective ca2+-cam dependent regulation in addition to the diversity of cam-target interfaces  <cit> .

ph dependence of cooperative ca2+ binding to cam
ca2+ binding to cam has been reported to be dependent on the acidity of the solution  <cit> . the detailed cam model comprising symmetrical pairwise influence of ca2+ binding sites in n- and c- terminal domains has been employed to investigate the impact of ph on the cooperative ca2+ binding. it is established that the macroscopic dissociation constants at the n- and c- terminal differ by an order of magnitude. the two ef-hand globular domains of cam appear to play separate roles in intracellular signalling by selectively modulating various effectors  <cit> . the model predictions in comparison with the experimental data for ca2+ binding to cam published in  <cit>  reveal that protonation decreases ca2+ affinity to cam. this result exemplifies the advantages of the proposed detailed ca2+ binding model to cam over the hill and adair equations in allowing enhanced interpretation of the same experimental dose-response curves. interestingly, in this case it suggests the complete elimination of cooperativity between ca2+ binding sites  in both n- and c- terminals under increased ph conditions. finally, table  <dig> compares the dissociation constants derived in those studies cited above where the experimental results were fitted by the hill and adair equations, with those produced by the proposed model. the significant differences in the values of the resulting dissociation constants reflect the different assumptions made about the mechanism of ca2+-cam interactions, and highlight the importance of developing detailed mathematical models which specifically reflect the structure of the molecular interactions being considered.

k <dig> is the dissociation constant for a ca2+ binding site in the n-terminal, kc <dig> is a cooperatively modified dissociation constant for a ca2+ binding site in the n-terminal when a neighbouring site is occupied, k <dig> is a dissociation constant for a ca2+ binding site in the c-terminal, and kc <dig> is a cooperatively influenced dissociation constant for a ca2+ binding site in the c-terminal when a neighbouring site is occupied. all constants shown are in Î¼m.

discussion
in this paper a structural model of cam interactions with and without cooperativity has been used to elucidate the mechanisms of ca2+-cam-target complex assembly. the differences seen in dose-response curves for proteins activated by ca2+-cam pairs were explained in terms of cooperative interactions between the ef-hand pairs  <cit>  in both cam domains. this study predicts that the specific interaction interface between cam and cam-regulated proteins  <cit>  is complemented by a number of additional factors influencing the ca2+-cam-target complex assembly. by comparing our model predictions with experimentally measured dose-response curves from the literature, we propose that some proteins bind cam without ca2+ ions and only become activated when ca2+ ions interact with the cam-target complex, whereas others are activated by cam molecules with already bound ca2+ ions. the ca2+-cam interaction properties are tuned by the target proteins and characterized not only by the macroscopic dissociation constant set for ca2+ sites, but also by the macroscopic cooperatively altered dissociation constants that are also unique to the cam binding proteins. in other words, the order of ca2+-cam-target complex assembly, the number of bound ca2+ ions, target specific ca2+-cam cooperative affinities, in addition to unique cam-target interaction interfaces, all allow cam to achieve its highly versatile intracellular multifunctionality. this proposition also explains the effects of ph on the considered dose-response curves by allowing for the modulation of the cooperatively effected dissociation constants. we would also like to point out that while we addressed the ca2+-cam interactions in great detail, the model could still be developed further by incorporating detailed dissociation constants between the intermediate ca2+-cam complexes and target proteins in a similar way to how it has been done for the ca2+-cam interactions.

although the presented model predicts similar curves to the ones already used to approximate the experimental ca2+-cam-target dose-response data using the hill and adair models, it allows a far more detailed interpretation of the ca2+-cam dependent interactions involved. in particular, it distinguishes the structure-dependent properties of cam molecules and suggests potential scenarios for ca2+-cam-target complex assembly. importantly, it reveals the cam specific type of cooperativity involved in this process and helps to explain the contribution of cooperativity in the specificity of cam-dependent regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a number of conclusions from this study which, we believe, contribute to improving our understanding of intracellular cam regulation and provide useful hypotheses for further experimental validation.

 mathematical models for protein interactions are usually derived according to a number of assumptions which will inevitably be more or less applicable to each particular protein. the structure of cam suggests that this molecule is very likely to have non-sequential ca2+ access to ef-hand binding sites. the results of our analysis support the theory of non-sequential cooperative access of ca2+ to cam binding sites, and also allow the derivation of cooperatively effected dissociation constants, thus providing a more realistic tool for fitting experimental dose-response curves.

 our model suggests that the structural data alone cannot provide the required level of information and comparisons with the dose-response data are required. predictions from the mathematical model used in this study were compared with the dose-response curves for ca2+ binding to cam and ca2+-cam-target peptides. this analysis allowed us to distinguish between  proteins that form a complex with cam in its ca2+ free state and then interact with ca2+ ions and  other proteins which interact with ca2+ bound cam with variable numbers of ca2+ ions. however, the transient kinetics has not been addressed in this study.

 in addition to the diversity of interaction interfaces, the specificity and selectivity of cam target activation may be achieved by variations in the target-specific dissociation and cooperatively effected dissociation constants, the order of ca2+-cam-target complex assembly and the number of ca2+ ions required to bind cam for target activation.
