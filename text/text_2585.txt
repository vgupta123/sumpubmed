BACKGROUND
gambierdiscus species  can produce maitotoxins , ladder-like polycyclic ether compounds  <cit> , a structure principally reported from dinoflagellates. mtx- <dig> is the largest and the most toxic natural non-biopolymer known  <cit> , and is similar to other polyether compounds such as okadaic acid  and brevetoxins  produced by prorocentrum spp and karenia brevis, respectively . a plethora of stable isotope feeding studies conducted on dinoflagellates producing btxs, oa and dinophysistoxins  provide substantial evidence to support the polyketide origin of these polyether ladder compounds . despite this, gene clusters associated with the biosynthesis of polyether ladders have not been elucidated, and little is known about the genes involved in this process. gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of the non-ladder polyether compounds, monensin and nanchangmycin, have been elucidated in bacteria  <cit> . the putative alkene precursor of these compounds are synthesised via type i polyketide synthases . it is proposed that the alkene undergoes epoxidation and polyepoxide cyclisation to form ether linkages  <cit> . in monensin biosynthesis, these steps could be performed by putative epoxidases and epoxide hydrolases, which are also found in the gene cluster responsible for monensin biosynthesis in addition to a full type i pks assembly  <cit> . in the case of monensin, the deletion of either of these genes ceases the production of the polyether, supporting this hypothesis  <cit> . in the case of btxs, it is also proposed that the carbon backbone is mostly trans-polyene, and it undergoes epoxidation and polyepoxide cyclisation to form btx  <cit> . very little evidence has been determined to support this hypothesis for btxs, however, there is evidence suggesting the presence of beta epoxidation intermediate, shown by 18o incorporation from molecular oxygen into c, d and e rings of oa  <cit>  and yessotoxins  <cit> . similar to the proposed biosynthetic pathway for btxs  <cit> , we propose a possible biosynthetic pathway for mtx- <dig> synthesis , in which the carbon backbone is synthesised via polyketide biosynthesis followed by epoxidation, polyepoxide cyclisation and sulphonation carried out by pkss, epoxidases, epoxide hydrolases and sulfotransferases.fig.  <dig> proposed mechanism for maitotoxin- <dig> production. polyene  produced by polyketide biosynthesis undergoes epoxidation, epoxide cyclisation and sulfonation to form maitotoxin-1



there are three major functional groups of pkss. type i pks are large multifunctional proteins, comprising several essential domains: acyltransferase domain , β-ketosynthase domain  and acyl carrier protein ; they can also include β-ketoacyl reductase , enoyl reductase , methyl transferases , thioesterases  and dehydrogenase  domains  <cit> . in iterative type i polyketide synthesis the same set of catalytic domains are present in one protein and used in a cyclic fashion for chain elongation, analogous to fatty acid synthesis   <cit> . in contrast, modular type i pks catalytic domains are organised in modules comprising all required domains for each step and each module is only used once during polyketide assembly  <cit> . type ii pks consist of mono-functional proteins with each catalytic domain on a separate peptide that form complexes for polyketide assembly  <cit> .

dinoflagellates possess some of the largest genomes known from eukaryotes, from  <dig>  to  <dig> gbp  <cit> . their gene content has been estimated to be much smaller than would be anticipated based on their genome size, at  <dig>  –  <dig>  protein coding genes  <cit> . the copy number of individual genes can vary significantly, between  <dig> copies   <cit>  to  <dig> copies   <cit> , and up to  <dig>  copies of common genes such as rrna  <cit> . such huge genome sizes and high gene copy numbers have made entire genome sequencing for these organisms unfeasible. recent advancement of high throughput sequencing technologies has now made it feasible to study the gene content of these organisms at the genomic and transcriptomic level. recently, a partial draft assembly of symbiodinium minutum genome, which has amongst the smallest genomes of a dinoflagellate, has been achieved  <cit> . in dinoflagellates, the lack of axenic cultures, as well as the difficulty in constructing genetic mutations and screening mutants, has meant that confirming the roles of genes in biosynthetic pathways is currently not possible. despite the challenges, type i modular pks genes have been identified in karenia brevis  <cit> , heterocapsa circularisquama  <cit> , heterocapsa triquetra  <cit> , alexandrium ostenfeldii  <cit> , azadinium sp.  <cit>  and several amphidinium species  <cit>  via transcriptomics. in dinoflagellates mrna undergoes trans-splicing with an addition of a 22-nt conserved spliced leader  to the 5’ end of the sequence  <cit> . sequencing of full-length mature mrna transcripts containing the sl sequence and phylogenetic analysis is necessary to distinguish these sequences from bacterial pks genes, originating from non-axenic cultures. interestingly, in most of the previous studies, full-length transcripts only encoded one catalytic domain, but were homologous to type i pkss, suggesting a novel mono-functional type i pks in dinoflagellates  <cit> . however, if polyether ladders are produced by modular type i pks enzymes, based on the structure of these compounds, the pks sequences discovered so far likely represent only a fraction of the pks genes present.

here we present comprehensive transcriptomic libraries of two species of gonyaulacaleaen and mtx producing dinoflagellates, gambierdiscus australes and g. belizeanus. a large number of genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of polyether ladder compounds were found. in addition, genes involved in other regulatory pathways were also mapped. genome sizes and the number of genes were estimated using flow cytometry and statistical analysis. the toxin profiles of the species were generated via liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry  against toxin standards, and the toxicity was determined using mouse bioassay.

RESULTS
genome size analysis
we determined a dna content of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg cell- <dig> for gambierdiscus australes and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg cell- <dig> for g. belizeanus via flow cytometry , which equates to a genome size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gbp and 35 ±  <dig>  gbp, respectively . while very large compared to other eukaryotes, both genomes were comparatively smaller than expected, given the large cell sizes of gambierdiscus species based on a comparison of  <dig> dinoflagellate species . genome sequencing has been used to elucidate pks gene clusters from many organisms, however, instead of sequencing such large genomes, comparative transcriptomic studies may be an efficient method for finding novel dinoflagellate genes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> genome sizes obtained via flow cytometry, chemical analyses via lc-ms, mouse bioassays and bioinformatic analysis of gene catalogues of g. australes and g. belizeanus




toxin analysis
cell extracts of g. australes cawd <dig> contained mtx- <dig> and putative mtx- <dig>  whereas g. belizeanus ccmp <dig> extract contained only putative mtx- <dig> . no ciguatoxins were detected in extracts of either species. while the toxicity of mtx- <dig> to mice by ip injection is well documented  <cit> , the toxicity of mtx- <dig> had not been previously determined. the cell extract of g. belizeanus had an ld <dig> of  <dig>  mg kg- <dig> in mouse bioassays using ip injection, causing abdominal breathing, decreased respiration rates and ultimately death through respiratory paralysis. the ld <dig> of this extract is higher than that for pure mtx- <dig>   <cit> , but lower than the ld <dig> of other toxins such as saxitoxin   <cit> . the structure of mtx- <dig> is not yet fully elucidated, however, it probably has a polyether ladder structure similar to mtx- <dig>  <cit> .

transcriptomic analysis
we generated comprehensive transcriptomic libraries of two species of mtx-producing and non-ciguatoxins  producing dinoflagellates, gambierdiscus australes and g. belizeanus, with an aim to investigate the evolution of pks enzyme complexes . here, we report gene catalogues of  <dig>   and  <dig>   unique contigs, that are amongst the most comprehensive yet reported from dinoflagellates . based on the genome size, gene number was estimated as  <dig>  ±  <dig> protein-coding and  <dig>  ±  <dig> total genes per genome in g. australes, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> protein-coding and  <dig>  ±  <dig> total genes per genome in g. belizeanus using the empirical regression equation of hou & lin  <cit> . sequences encoding all the essential enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxalic acid cycle, c- <dig> carbon cycle, pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative phosphorylation were found and could be fully annotated among the  <dig>  and  <dig>  fully annotated sequences in g. australes and g. belizeanus transcriptomes respectively .

the presence of  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of  <dig> highly conserved proteins included in the core eukaryotic genes mapping approach  software, served as an additional test of the comprehensiveness of the catalogues . the other published protist gene catalogues investigated via cegma analysis to date, toxoplasma gondii, had  <dig>  %  <cit> , karenia brevis had 84 % , 82 %  and 81 %   <cit>  and karlodinium micrum had 74 %  <cit>  of the  <dig> highly conserved protein datasets. however, some protein orthologues may not have been recognised using cegma analysis due to the high degree of sequence divergence of protists from other eukaryotes.

a full suite of histone encoding genes  was also found in both the gene catalogues  as previously reported in various symbiodinium species  <cit>  and lingulodinium polyedrum  <cit> . a phylogeny of the h2a histone proteins revealed the presence of h2a.x variants of the histone proteins. dinoflagellate h2a.x sequences form a distinct well-supported clade and were clearly distinguished from other major groups of h2a.x and h2a.z variants .

in dinoflagellates, the presence of sl sequence provides a means to distinguish full-length mature dinoflagellate transcripts from transcripts derived from bacteria associated with non-axenic cultures. our gene catalogue consisted of one of the largest collection of full-length transcripts  reported for any dinoflagellate transcriptome library . the fact that only 63 % and 54 % of full-length transcripts, respectively, could be annotated is intriguing, suggesting that many transcripts might be involved in novel processes. this was also the case for total transcripts in the gene catalogues, with more than 50 % having no blastx match, similar to recently published catalogues from l. polyedrum  and k.brevis .

our gambierdiscus gene catalogues contained a large number and diversity of genes putatively involved in polyketide biosynthesis, including a total of  <dig> unique transcripts  encoding complete ks domains . the presence of dinoflagellate-specific sl in five ks transcripts, their similarity  to ks domains from other dinoflagellates  and the monophyletic clustering of all dinoflagellate ks transcripts within a protistan ks domain cluster in the phylogenies, provides consistent and substantial evidence of the dinoflagellate origin of these transcripts . the  <dig> dinoflagellate ks transcripts included in the phylogenetic analysis grouped with type i pks with strong support and could be resolved in  <dig> well-supported clades within the dinoflagellate clade . as ks domains are used by pkss and fatty acid synthases , the transcripts in these clades might be involved in either or both of these processes. the clades also consisted of ks transcripts found only in btx-producing karenia brevis  <cit> , including four ks transcripts found in both btx-producing and non-producing k. brevis  <cit> , three ks transcripts from spirolide producing alexandrium ostenfeldii  <cit> , five ks transcripts from azaspiracid producing azadinium spinosum  <cit> , two ks transcripts from ctx producing g. polynesiensis  <cit> , two ks transcripts from toxic heterocapsa triquetra  <cit> and three ks transcripts from non-toxic h. circularisquama  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of polyketide synthases  genes. a phylogenetic analysis of type i and type ii ketoacyl synthase  domains from prokaryotic and eukaryotic pks and fatty acid synthases . two hundred and twenty nine ks domains representing  <dig> taxa were analysed via a maximum likelihood approach in phyml using the le gascuel substitution model and  <dig> bootstrap replicates. b phylogenetic analysis of type i and type ii ketoreductase  domains. the sequences include prokaryotic and eukaryotic pkss and fass. fifty-six kr domains representing  <dig> taxa were analysed via maximum likelihood approach using the le gascuel substitution model and  <dig> bootstrap replicates



we suggest that clades c, d and e, which contain ks sequences from almost all dinoflagellates included in the analyses, are more likely to be involved in a common synthesis pathway, such as fas. however, clade a contained only ks sequences from polyether ladder-producing dinoflagellates while clade b contained only ks sequences from g. belizeanus and g. australes , suggesting these sequences may be involved in the synthesis of mtxs or other unique pks products from this genus. most previous studies of ks diversity in dinoflagellate transcriptomes had much lower sequence depth and coverage, therefore similar sequences may be present in other species, but have not been detected. this includes the recently published g. polynesiensis transcriptome  <cit>  in which  <dig> transcripts encoding ks domains were detected, however, only two transcripts had full-length ks domains encoded. in-depth transcriptomic analysis of cultures of other dinoflagellates with comprehensive toxin profiles are required to be more certain of the role of the sequences in these three clades.

both gambierdiscus transcriptomes examined here also contained numerous other putative polyketide domains , including a transcript resembling a type ii kr domain . kr domains have been found previously in k. brevis  <cit> , a. carterae  <cit>  and a. spinosum  <cit> . this is the first study to show that the majority form a strongly supported cluster with type i pks .

as demonstrated previously  <cit> , a surprising feature of the dinoflagellate transcripts encoding ks and kr domains is that they contain only one domain per transcript. previously this feature has been characteristic of type ii pkss, yet our phylogenetic analyses show that they formed strongly supported clades with other type i pks sequences , except for the single type ii related kr domain described above . other protists such as species of apicomplexans and haptophytes display classic type i pks modules, containing several domains, encoded on a single transcript  <cit>  and it appears that the monofunctional expression of type i pks transcripts is unique to dinoflagellates  <cit> .

some pks at domain transcripts also encoded ankyrin proteins , which are known to mediate the attachment of integral membrane proteins in mammals  <cit> . ats with ankyrin proteins are generally involved in many other pathways  <cit>  and often are not embedded into pk megasynthases, but instead operating as individual trans proteins  <cit> . their variable genomic clustering therefore makes it difficult to identify, which ats may be involved in polyketide synthesis  <cit> .

if mtx- <dig> is produced by type i modular pks it would likely contain  <dig> modules, given the monofunctional role of these enzymes. if each ks domain in each module was encoded by a separate transcript then this accounts for the large number of transcripts recovered from these two gambierdiscus species. early theoretical pathways for polyether ladder synthesis predict epoxidation and cyclisation of polyether ladders during polyketide synthesis  <cit> , however, the pathway proposed here involves modification of the carbon backbone after polyketide synthesis  as in the case of monensin biosynthesis, which is a non-ladder polyether compound  <cit> . we also detected transcripts encoding for enzymes epoxidases, epoxy hydrolases and sulfotransferases that could perform expoxidation, cyclisation and sulfonation of polyether compounds, respectively , supporting the proposed biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in dinoflagellates, the difficulty of generating and subsequent poor survival of axenic cultures, combined with the difficulty of genetic transformation and screening, means that confirming the role of genes in toxin biosynthesis pathways is currently very difficult. linking genes to polyketide production in dinoflagellates requires comparative transcriptomic studies of species with contrasting polyketide production profiles. the results presented here are a major contribution towards eventually recognising the genes that encode a critical step in each type of polyketide biosynthesis.
