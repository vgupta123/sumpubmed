BACKGROUND
the presence of several paralogous gene regions, forming so-called paralogons
 <cit>  with gene family members on two
to four chromosomes in mammals, has been taken as evidence for two rounds of whole
genome duplication "2r", deduced to have taken place in the ancestor of vertebrates
 <cit> . the
hox gene clusters  have been used as
the prime example of quadruplicate paralogy in vertebrate genomes, reviewed by hoegg
and meyer  <cit> , as compared to the single
hox cluster in the cephalochordate lineage  <cit> . until recently the number of hox clusters in cartilaginous
fishes has been unclear. the sequencing of the elephant shark genome
 established that four hox-clusters were already
present in the ancestor of jawed vertebrates  <cit> . the hox clusters are also known to be special in many
ways, particularly in the way they are transcriptionally regulated  <cit> . tunicate species like ciona intestinalis
and oikopleura dioika, which have broken hox clusters  <cit> , are considered to be exceptions from the linear
organization of vertebrate and cephalochordate hox clusters, because the linear
cluster of hox genes was present in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians and
possibly before the origin of cnidarians  <cit> .

in ray-finned fishes, an additional tetraploidization  has been inferred based on
the occurrence additional hox clusters not present in other vertebrate lineages
 <cit> . this has been confirmed using
whole genome data from fully sequenced teleosts  <cit> . the study of hox genes as
well as other gene families in several species of actinopterygians has further
indicated that the duplication event took place early in the evolution of
actinopterygians  <cit> . it has also been proposed that the high number of
duplicate genes created in 3r was in part involved in the radiation of teleost
fishes  <cit> . the great number of species within the euteleostei as
compared to more basal actinopterygians supports the idea that genome duplication
and speciation are linked  <cit>  even though there seem to be a large time span between
the duplication event and the actual radiation of euteleosts  <cit> . several teleost
lineages, for example cyprinidae, salmonidae, and catostomidae  <cit>  are known polyploids of relatively recent
origin. the relation between polyploidy and speciation is not yet fully clear but it
is worth noting that several species-rich fish clades are polyploids  <cit> . both the existence of tetraploids and
evidence of independent gene duplications indicate that fish genomes are in some
sense more "plastic" than genomes in other vertebrates  <cit> .

after duplication, the genes can undergo nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization
or neofunctionalization. it has been calculated that a duplicated gene in general
has an average half-life of approximately  <dig> million years before it will be silenced
 <cit> . but there are also examples of
genes that have recently become pseudogenes even if the duplication took place a
long time ago. some of those examples are the hoxb <dig> gene in takifugu rubripes
 <cit>  and many of the olfactory
genes in hominids  <cit> . another example is
the neuropeptide y receptor y <dig> that arose very early in vertebrate evolution and
later has been mutated to become a pseudogene seemingly independently in many
mammalian lineages  <cit> . the rate of
retention of genes after duplication has been investigated in several lineages. the
obtained values vary considerably depending on species and time since
tetraploidization, for example 8–16% in yeast  <cit> ,
15–24% for teleosts after 3r  <cit> , 30% in arabidopsis
after its last tetraploidization  <cit> 
and about 50% after the salmonid tetraploidization  <cit> . it also seems like there is  a connection between "survival" after the first and any
subsequent genome duplications. genes that have been preserved after the first
tetraploidization are more likely to be retained after subsequent tetraploidization
 <cit> . however, several factors
obscure analyses of old duplication events, such as the frequent loss of genes after
duplication, gene conversion and unequal evolutionary rates of paralogs. because of
this the use of the topology of phylogenetic trees as the only criterion for
inferring block duplications is not sufficient and the symmetrical , 
topology expected by two duplication events is rarely seen  <cit> . we believe that a combination
of phylogenetic and map-based approaches using several species is much more useful
to resolve the evolutionary history of gene families as has been pointed out earlier
 <cit> .
although there is evidence for at least one tetraploidization in early vertebrate
evolution the concept of two basal vertebrate tetraploidizations has been difficult
to establish until recent studies that used both phylogenetic and positional
information  <cit>  or only the latter
 <cit>  from several sequenced
vertebrate genomes. the recent publication of the amphioxus genome confirmed
quadruplication of gene regions in gnathostomes  <cit> .

because each hox cluster is located in a rather limited part of its chromosome,
studies of more gene families are needed to fully understand the evolutionary
history of the hox-bearing chromosomes. in this work we have performed phylogenetic
analyses of gene families located near the hox clusters in several vertebrates in
order to see if there are additional gene families with an evolutionary history
similar to that of the hox clusters. our starting point in this work was the
position of the genes coding for neuropeptide y  family peptides in the
pufferfish takifugu rubripes and the zebrafish danio rerio
compared to the positions in the human genome.

RESULTS
in total,  <dig> protein families predicted by the ensembl database were studied in
detail . some of these families
were further divided into subfamilies based on positions of invertebrate sequences
in the initial phylogenetic analysis. species included in the initial analysis were
chosen in order to achieve relative dating of the duplications, thus avoiding
analyses of duplication events that occurred before the emergence of chordates .

three families in addition to the  <dig> analyzed families fulfilled the selection
criteria  but had to be excluded for technical reasons, namely because
repeated domains made the sequences difficult to align, thereby precluding reliable
phylogenetic analyses. these families were asb , hdac  and mgat .

for some of the fish sequences no clear human orthologs are found in the phylogenetic
trees . however, when chromosome position information is

gene families represented on four human hox chromosomes
igfbp, insulin like growth factor binding proteins, are part of a
loosely defined superfamily  <cit> . the
igfbp family studied here is comprised by the six members with high-affinity
binding to insulin and is represented on all four of the human hox-bearing
chromosomes. on both hsa  <dig> and  <dig> they appear as gene pairs resulting from a
duplication before the separation of the branch leading to the mammals and the
branch leading to the teleosts . both of these pairs display
retained 3r copies in at least one fish species for each gene . one takifugu rubripes gene, called tru.sc <dig> a
in fig. 1a, appears in an unexpected position in the tree.
however, this sequence has a deviating segment compared to all other igfbp
sequences, probably due to difficulties with exon-intron prediction in the
database. in our quartet puzzling maximum likelihood analysis , this gene product clusters with the
tetraodon nigroviridis sequence tni. <dig>  favoring orthology in
agreement with the chromosomal position . this
family has recently been studied by others  <cit>  giving a similar topology but with a different
interpretation of the evolutionary history of this gene family .

nfe <dig>  family members are involved in gene
transcription and due to the presence of four genes located in the vicinity of
all four hox clusters, this family has previously been suggested to have had a
similar evolutionary history as the hox clusters  <cit> . our results are
compatible with such a scenario but the topology in our tree is somewhat
difficult to interpret , especially regarding
identification of fish orthologs. this is probably due to problems with
obtaining a reliable alignment for this family because the paralogs only have a
short conserved domain in otherwise divergent sequences. nevertheless, all genes
display conserved synteny and have evolved in a time frame consistent with
2r.

gene families represented on three human hox chromosomes
dlx genes form gene pairs on three of the chromosomes  in
the hox paralogon. three of these human genes  cluster
in the phylogenetic trees with genes that were duplicated in fishes . the dlx
family is a widely studied family with important functions in vertebrate
development  <cit> . our results confirm an
early local duplication followed by chromosome duplication for this family as
previously suggested  <cit> .

igf2bp, igf-2-mrna binding proteins, also called imps, are part of an
mrna localization and transport system. the family has members on three of the
human chromosomes analyzed in the study. it has previously been suggested that
the family originated by duplications before the vertebrate radiation
 <cit> .
our phylogenetic analyses support an origin in 2r and also an expansion in the
zebrafish in 3r .

slc4a is a family that is part of the solute carrier superfamily and
catalyzes transmembrane bicarbonate transport in the anion exchanger 
subfamily  <cit> . others have recently
analyzed a larger part of this superfamily resulting in a similar tree topology
 <cit> . the family has members on
hsa  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and as in many of the other gene families, only one case where
both copies resulting from 3r have been retained .

smarcd, swi/snf-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulators
of chromatin  is a family involved in chromatin remodeling complexes
 <cit> . we have studied one
subfamily with three human members . it
seems like a lineage-specific duplication has occurred in ciona, but
the rest of the family has expanded in a time window in agreement with 2r
.

osbpl, oxysterol-binding proteins are a large family involved in diverse
cellular processes with an oxysterol binding domain as common feature
 <cit> 
and we have studied one subfamily with the human members located on chromosomes
 <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in one case 3r is clearly visible in
the tree .
illustrating the human paralogon analyzed in this study. gene order as
on chromosome  <dig>  observe that figure is not drawn to scale.

rar, retinoic acid receptors, a gene family belonging to the nuclear
receptor superfamily .

gene families represented on two human hox chromosomes
nuclear receptors
the gene families belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, rar, thr and
nr1d, have been studied previously  <cit>  with similar results as obtained in
this study. the nr1d and thr families have members on hsa  <dig> and  <dig>  and the
rar family also includes a member on hsa  <dig>  some duplicates from 3r are
also retained  and these display conserved synteny with their
mammalian orthologs . it should be noted that the timing for the
duplications is uncertain in the nr1d family with one branchiostoma
floridae sequence clustering together with orthologs of the
vertebrate nr1d <dig> sequences, however with low bootstrap support .

aoc,  gene family 
belongs to the copper-binding amino oxidase superfamily. the human members
in this study include one on chromosome  <dig> and two on chromosome  <dig>  the
chromosomal locations are as expected by block duplication in early
vertebrate evolution .

g6pc   is
an enzyme involved in both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and has two
members on hsa  <dig> and one on hsa  <dig>  <cit> . due to lack of sequences from ciona and
branchiostoma floridae, the time window when the expansion of
this family took place is wide. the duplication on hsa  <dig> is present also in
the fishes, indicating origin before the divergence of sarcopterygians and
actinopterygians. in addition, the teleost fishes have a local duplication
of one of these orthologs resulting in three members of this family located
on the same chromosome . for one of these
genes it seems like the zebrafish has retained both of the copies formed in
3r . furthermore, the dre3
gene has undergone a recent duplication in the zebrafish , although this could also be a result of an assembly
error in the database.

mpp, is a subfamily of the membrane-associated guanylase kinase
homologs superfamily, an old family involved in cell signaling
 <cit> . our subfamily has
members on hsa  <dig> and  <dig>  the tree displays a topology consistent with 3r
.

upp, uridine phosphorylate is a small family that catalyzes the
reversible phosphorylitic cleavage of uridine, deoxyuridine and thymidine
 <cit> . it consists of only
two human members that seem to have evolved in the same time frame as the
proposed 2r events .

discussion
extending our previous observation that the two npy-family genes npy and pyy are
located near the hox clusters  <cit> , we
recently reported that these syntenies exist also in the pufferfishes takifugu
rubripes and tetraodon nigroviridis, the medaka oryzias
latipes, the stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus and the zebrafish
danio rerio  <cit> . thus, these
syntenies are likely to have existed in the common ancestor of tetrapods  and actinopterygians. these chromosome regions have undergone
further duplications in the teleost fish tetraploidization, 3r, resulting in
duplicates of both the hox clusters and the npy and pyy genes. several other gene
families have been suggested to have been duplicated together with the hox clusters
 <cit> . to our knowledge the
evolutionary histories of only a few families have been investigated in the hox
paralogon using both sequence phylogenies and synteny comparisons, for example the
dlx family  <cit> ,
the nuclear receptor family  <cit>  and the
voltage-gated sodium channels  <cit> . in the present study, we have investigated in detail
several additional gene families that are represented on multiple chromosomes in the
hox paralogon. with the npy-family genes as starting points in takifugu
rubripes, danio rerio and human, we identified  <dig> gene families
that are present on two, three, or all four of the human hox chromosomes. we have
studied the phylogenies of these gene families initially with the neighbor-joining
method and subsequently with quartet puzzling maximum likelihood, and report here
that  <dig> of the  <dig> families have members that seem to have been duplicated in the
early stages of vertebrate evolution . the
remaining family, g6pc, also has a topology consistent with 2r but due to lack of
urochordate or cephalochordate sequences the time window is wider when these
expansions could have occurred. the inclusion of human chromosome  <dig> as part of this
paralogon has been suggested earlier  <cit> . however, it is not clear if paralogs on hsa <dig> were
ancestrally linked to genes on hsa <dig>  or hsa  <dig>  <cit>  before the duplication events. the current
analysis is not able to resolve this ambiguity.
information

* duplicates in one fish species for one of the mammalian sequences have been
considered to be support for 3r.

two gene families that have members on all four of the human hox chromosomes were
identified, namely igfbp and nfe <dig>  the nfe <dig> family sequences are difficult to align
as explained in results and thus the phylogenetic analysis must be interpreted with
caution, suffice to conclude that the tree topology 
is consistent with a quadruplication in early vertebrate evolution. from our
analysis it is not possible to deduce if the igfbp family had one or two members at
the time of divergence of the common ancestor of actinopterygians and
sarcopterygians from the tunicate lineage . the local
duplication event could have occurred in early vertebrate evolution, whereupon the
gene pair was duplicated as a unit, most likely concomitantly with hox .
two of the igfbp duplicates seem to have been lost before the divergence of
actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. this scenario is one plausible explanation of
the present situation in the human genome with igfbp gene pairs on hsa  <dig> and  <dig> and
single genes on hsa  <dig> and  <dig> . the most
parsimonious explanation for the observed topology is that loss of genes took place
between 1r and 2r. abbasi et al.  <cit> 
interpreted this tree differently, stating that the most parsimonious explanation is
two genome duplications followed by two local duplications on chromosome  <dig> and 7
respectively. in our opinion it is not possible to interpret the tree topology this
way. if the local duplications occurred after the whole genome duplications one
would expect a different topology, with the locally duplicated genes on hsa7
clustering together and the ones on hsa <dig> clustering together. this is not the case
. their alternative hypothesis includes three
whole genome duplications and two losses. in order for this scenario to be
compatible with the topology and localization two translocations must have occurred.
this involves two additional steps and it also suggests that three whole genome
duplications have occurred, but this is not observed for any of the other families
in their study.

six gene families were found to be represented on three of the human hox chromosomes,
i.e., dlx, igf2bp, slc4a, smarcd, osbpl and rar. note that the dlx family underwent
a local duplication before the chromosome duplications, in analogy with the igfbp
family described above, as shown by the phylogenetic tree in fig. 1c and the chromosome maps in figs.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  this family has previously been difficult to resolve using
sequence analyses in mammals, but thanks to the many fish sequences it can be
established that dlx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> form one series of paralogs and that dlx  <dig>   <dig> and 5
form another  <cit> .

representation on two of the mammalian hox chromosomes was found for six gene
families, namely two of the three nuclear receptor families thr and nr1d, as well as
aoc, g6pc, mpp, and upp. the aoc family , for
instance, is represented on hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> with orthologs located in the
corresponding regions in the mouse genome. a local duplication has occurred in
mammals, resulting in aoc <dig> and aoc <dig> on hsa <dig>  with loss of aoc <dig> in mouse. there is
also a third member located on chromosome  <dig> – a pseudogene that was not
present in version  <dig> of the ensembl database  <cit> . a series of duplications has occurred in the mouse genome
resulting in four copies on mmu <dig>  <cit> . in
contrast, no additional duplications have occurred among the fish species, not even
in 3r.

the g6pc family  is also represented on two
chromosomes in human .
the local duplication observed on hsa <dig> is present also in the three teleosts
studied, showing that it happened before the sarcopterygian-actinopterygian split
. interestingly, the three teleosts have an additional
local duplication of one of these genes, not present in the mammals. in this case,
zebrafish seems to have retained a 3r duplicate of one of these genes  which
has a copy on dre <dig> 

these gene families show that local duplications occur frequently and thereby
complicate delineation of gene family histories that involve both local and
chromosome duplications. to distinguish between locally duplicated genes and gene
duplicates resulting from large-scale events such as 2r, the use of several species
is crucial. it has recently been suggested that gene families located on the
hox-bearing chromosomes were not duplicated together with hox based on the observed
differences in the topologies  <cit> . instead
the gene families were proposed to have duplicated in several independent
small-scale events and later translocated to the same chromosomes  <cit> . this suggests independent translocation
events before the divergence of actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. in the light
of the results from large-scale studies describing duplicated regions in the genomes
of extant vertebrates and the reconstruction of ancestral chromosomes  <cit>  it seems unlikely
that the observed pattern arose by many independent duplications followed by
translocations to the same chromosomes. furthermore, the strict demand for -topologies as the only criteria to support 2r is to restrictive due to
complications such as unequal evolutionary rates, gene conversion and loss of genes
after duplication. thus, trees not showing the perfect -topology are
still compatible with large-scale duplication events if the relative dating of these
events agrees with positional information from several species.

it was expected that several of the gene families would display fewer than four
members in mammals, and likewise fewer than eight members in the teleosts . as has been described on numerous previous occasions, gene
losses are common after duplications why at least one member is often missing.
striking examples of gene loss are seen in the hox clusters, where the ancestral set
of  <dig> genes should have resulted in  <dig> genes after the block quadruplication.
however, one of the ancestral hox genes  has lost all four paralogs in
mammals after the duplications  <cit> , and several other hox genes
have lost 1– <dig> of the duplicates, resulting in the present number of  <dig> hox
genes in mammalian genomes. furthermore, both the pufferfishes and zebrafish seem to
have lost a whole hox cluster, albeit different ones in these two lineages
 <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  information from families with only two members still gives
important information when they are interpreted together to define regions that have
been duplicated. if loss of genes from duplicated chromosomal segments occurs
independently, positional information from families with two members taken together
still gives valuable information.

in some of the gene families the teleost-specific duplicates are only represented in
one species . this made it difficult to distinguish
lineage-specific duplications from 3r duplications followed by loss of the duplicate
in some lineages. we believe the poor representation of 3r duplicates in our trees
is partly a reflection of the strict criteria we used when editing the alignments of
sequences from incomplete or poorly annotated genome databases. because sequences
lacking the analyzed domains were excluded, our dataset probably underestimates the
real number of family members in the included fish species. some of the genes
lacking domains could be on their way to become pseudogenes, but there could also be
problems in the prediction of coding regions in the fish genomes, for example due to
short introns in tetraodon nigroviridis  <cit> . even though we started our analysis in the fish genomes
and therefore should not be biased towards any of the human chromosomes, one of them
stands out as more poorly represented than the other three with regard to the number
of gene families, namely human chromosome  <dig>  uneven retention of gene duplicates on
different chromosomes resulting from a quadruplication has been observed previously
for the paralogon comprised by the human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  as well as for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 19
 <cit> . this could be the result of
more extensive rearrangements on some chromosomes, causing loss of genes for
instance by affecting gene regulatory elements.

in studies of gene duplications the dating of the duplication events is of course an
important factor. this can be done using molecular clocks  <cit> , ideally calibrated against known speciation events.
dating of duplication events can also be obtained by using information from several
species, thereby making it possible to relatively date the origin of genes in
relation to speciation events. the 2r tetraploidizations have been proposed to have
occurred after the split of urochordates and vertebrates but before the origin of
gnathostomes  <cit> . we used sequences from the
tunicates ciona intestinalis or ciona savignyi or the
cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae as outgroup to see if the
duplications we investigated took place in the vertebrate lineage, as the question
we wanted to address was whether the syntenic gene families expanded in the same
time window. so far it has not been possible to determine unambiguously whether both
of the 2r tetraploidizations took place before the origin of cyclostomes, or if the
second tetraploidization occurred on the gnathostome branch after it had separated
from the cyclostomes mainly due to lack of sequence information.

many types of genetic events complicate efforts to reconstruct the evolutionary
history of individual gene families, not only frequent duplications and losses, but
also differences in the rate of change between members in a gene family or in the
same gene over time. another source of difficulties that we have experienced, as
mentioned above, is uncertainties in protein alignments due to duplication of
domains in some family members. because sequence-based phylogenetic analyses and
chromosome positions  constitute two quite different types of
information, they can be combined to deduce evolutionary schemes in a more reliable
way. the combined use of synteny and phylogenetic information makes it possible to
delineate old and new duplications, identify translocations of genes and also allows
investigation of gene families with only two members. mechanisms like crossing-over
and gene conversion may still obscure relationships, but at least the latter is
expected to decrease with time as the family members accumulate differences that
reduce the likelihood of such events. particularly gene families with very short
sequences, and/or highly conserved or rapidly diverging sequences, can be resolved
by considering chromosomal position, as has been shown for the insulin/relaxin
family of peptides  <cit> , the npy family of
peptides as mentioned above  <cit> , and some
of the npy-family receptors  <cit>  as well as
for example the nfe <dig> family in this study. all of these families were found to have
expanded in the early vertebrate tetraploidizations.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study shows that the previously well-studied hox cluster was
certainly not the only gene family in this chromosomal segment that was quadrupled
in early vertebrate evolution: the duplicated regions extend quite far in both
directions from the hox clusters and involve a larger number of gene families that
are totally unrelated to the hox-gene sequences. many genes have been lost in these
families after the quadruplication, like in the hox clusters, thereby obscuring the
duplication events. nevertheless, the overall pattern of genes in the regions
flanking the four hox clusters clearly shows that the quadruplication encompasses a
major chromosomal segment, probably a complete ancestral chromosome.
