BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of short  non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. their regulatory potential relies heavily on the recognition of binding sites that are located mainly in the 3'-untranslated regions  of target messenger rnas   <cit> . currently, numerous mirnas with diverse sequences are being characterized in a wide range of species  <cit> , suggesting that this small rna molecule has a major effect on phylogeny. the importance of mirnas is also suggested from recent research demonstrating that mirna-guided gene regulation is involved in diverse biological functions, such as cell differentiation, development, carcinogenesis, and tumour suppression  <cit> . for example, phylogenetically conserved mirnas  are involved in cell differentiation and development  <cit> . in this case, let- <dig> regulates the expression of ras proteins known as critical oncogene products  <cit> . moreover, mir- <dig>  another evolutionarily conserved mirna, is a direct downregulator of p <dig> and is involved in a genetic pathway that promotes cell-cycle progression  <cit> .


in this study, we hypothesized that the core regulatory relationship between mirnas and their target genes were conserved throughout the evolution of bilaterian animals. in addition, by predicting these relationships, we sought to elucidate the core function of mirnas in the primitive gene-regulatory network of the common bilaterian ancestor. accordingly, we focused on five mirnas  that are conserved among bilaterian species , mus musculus , gallus gallus , drosophila melanogaster , and caenorhabditis elegans ) and designed a procedure to extract conserved mirna/target-gene pairs. we extracted evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs based on hybridization patterns and orthologous information. in addition, we experimentally verified several candidate pairs to support our methodology. our results suggest a functional role of three major mirnas  that regulated genes related to development, muscle formation, and cell adhesion. these results suggest a new role for the core function of mirnas in the primitive gene-regulatory network of the common bilaterian ancestor.

RESULTS
extraction of evolutionarily conserved mirnas among five bilaterian animals
to extract conserved mirna/target-gene pairs, we chose five model species  among bilaterian animals, for which there exists a vast array of data on both mirnas and mrnas  <cit> . previously, several important features were described to classify mirnas into families. it is well known that the seed sequence  is important for interaction with the target mrnas  <cit> . many mirna target prediction software programs were developed using the features of seed sequences  <cit> . moreover, several features have been proposed to identify conserved mirna families, such as conservation of the mature mirna sequence   <cit>  and information on the phylogenetic relationship among mirnas  <cit> . by focusing on these features, we proposed the following criteria for extracting well-conserved mirna families among five species:  complete seed sequence matching,  mature mirna sequence identity exceeding 75%, and  high conservation among mirna families, considering the phylogenetic relationship among mirnas   <cit> . consequently, from  <dig>  mature mirna sequences, we extracted five mirna families  conserved evolutionarily among the five bilaterian animals . the sequence identity among most of the conserved mirna families was over 80%. in particular, the sequences of let- <dig> and mir- <dig> family members showed very high mature mirna sequence identity  among all five bilaterian species, which suggests that a strong selective pressure exists for the nucleotide sequence. huang et al. described the extraction of  <dig> conserved mirna families among six bilaterian animals  based on their original classification method  <cit> , which included our five mirna families. in this manuscript, we devised more stringent criteria based on nucleotide conservation to extract highly conserved mirna families. nematostella vectensis and amphimedon queenslandica, which diverged before the emergence of bilaterian animals, reportedly express various types of mirnas  <cit> ; however, none of these mirnas are sequentially similar to the five evolutionarily conserved mirna families found in the current study , which suggests that these evolutionarily conserved mirnas appeared after the divergence of bilaterian animals or were lost in n. vectensis and a. queenslandica.

filtering and enrichment of the evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs
to extract genes targeted through evolution by the five conserved mirnas, we designed a procedure that comprised three screening steps . in step  <dig>  we extracted potential target genes based on optimal free-energy information with a requirement of complete seed-sequence-matching using the rnahybrid software  <cit> , which predicts potential binding sites of short rnas among target sequences. for this purpose, the optimal free energy was determined beforehand to efficiently cover experimentally validated mirna/target-gene pairs. we calculated the free energy of  <dig> experimentally validated mirna/target-gene pairs with a complete match of seed sequence, as assessed using rnahybrid; subsequently, we defined the optimal free energy as < - <dig> kcal/mole of potential mirna/target-gene pairs . the evaluation of target-gene extraction during each step was carried out using an index termed "enrichment" . as a result, in step  <dig>  the number of potential target-gene candidates decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an enrichment index of  <dig> . this prediction set contained  <dig> of the  <dig> experimentally validated target-gene pairs.

the total number of possible target genes for the five mirnas  is represented for the five model species at each screening step . asterisks indicate the number of orthologous genes conserved among at least four species. enrichment was calculated as the "ratio of experimentally verified mirna/target-gene pairs" divided by the "ratio of predicted mirna/target-gene pairs".

in step  <dig>  we considered the 3'-utr binding pattern of the mirna/target mrna. we defined four binding parameters  of the hybridization pattern  for optimisation of the thresholds for each of the features used to predict reliable mirna/mrna pairs. the ranges of the four binding parameters were determined by calculating the coverage of  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs verified experimentally and of  <dig>  mirna-mrna pairs predicted for each binding feature . five hundred parameter combinations were plotted on a 2d graph, using "enrichment" on the x-axis and "ratio of experimentally verified mirna/mrna" on the y-axis . from these parameter combinations, we defined the optimal combination of binding parameters for efficient screening based on a maximum ec value of  <dig>  . accordingly, the number of potential target-gene candidates was reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and the experimentally validated target genes decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> after introduction of the criterion of optimal hybridization pattern  .

finally, in step  <dig>  we incorporated orthologous gene information and extracted genes that were evolutionarily conserved among more than four diverse bilaterian animals, including h. sapiens. as a result, the number of predicted mirna/target-gene pairs was minimized substantially, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  using a significantly high enrichment index of  <dig>  . the number of predicted mirna/target-gene pairs was especially high for the three mirnas let- <dig> , mir- <dig> , and mir- <dig>  compared with mir-125/lin- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  . this suggests that let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> may have played a major role in primordial mirna gene regulation in the common bilaterian ancestor. to verify the significance of conserved mirna-target gene pairs, we performed same sequence analysis  against total  <dig> species-specific mirnas  as a control experiment supposing that these mirnas are also conserved in other bilaterians. for example, target prediction of hsa-mir- <dig>  a species-specific mirna in human was performed in all  <dig> species  and conserved targets were extracted . as a result,  <dig> out of  <dig> non-conserved mirnas did not show any conserved mirna-target gene pair. furthermore, average number of the mirna-target gene pairs of the negative control was  <dig> , which is statistically lower than that of conserved mirna-target gene pairs  <dig>  based on the welch's t-test . these results support that number of genes achieved from the prediction of conserved mirnas target genes in this study is indeed significant. in summary, we developed a new filtering method for extracting evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs, which was used to extract  <dig> reliable mirna/target-gene pairs among the five families of mirnas.

we discovered that only one orthologous target gene, calponin- <dig> , was conserved completely among the five bilaterian animals . as for target genes conserved in four species, we found, for example, the la-related protein  <dig> , ets domain-containing protein elk- <dig> , argonaute- <dig> , transgelin- <dig> , and v-type proton atpase subunit b brain isoform  genes . of note, the same approximate position of the predicted target site was observed in the orthologous 3'-utr of cnn <dig> ), larp <dig> , eif2c <dig> , and tagln <dig>  among vertebrates . according to bartel et al., the distribution of mirna target sites within the 3'-utr is biased near the mrna stop codon or poly-a tail compared with the middle portion of 3'-utr  <cit> . our results show that target site distribution varied according to the type of mirna target gene. the target sites on 3'-utr of cnn <dig> and tagln <dig> were biased near the stop codon, from h. sapiens to c. elegans . regarding the other candidates, we observed all types of target site distribution on 3'-utr. a future statistical analysis of mirna target-site distribution among conserved mirna/target-gene pairs is required to substantiate this view. with the exception of 3'-utr of the larp <dig> gene, most of the binding patterns of evolutionarily conserved target sites were sequentially different, without taking the seed region into consideration. the target-site binding patterns within 3'-utr of the larp <dig> gene were identical between h. sapiens and m. musculus , although the similarity of the two 3'-utr sequences was ~70% . a recent study reported on cooperative regulation by multiple mirnas  <cit> . likewise, the band  <dig> -like protein 4b  gene was an orthologous target of two different types of mirnas: mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . our analysis suggests that multiple mirna regulation may have already existed in the era of ancestral bilaterian species.

experimental validation of mirna target genes
to validate the evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene candidates, we performed transfection and luciferase assays on  <dig> of the  <dig> identified evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene candidates. four of the six candidates  were predicted to be regulated by mir- <dig>  while one candidate  was predicted to be targeted by mir- <dig>  and the final candidate  was predicted to be the target of let- <dig>  we used the well-established downregulation of the delta-like protein  <dig> precursor  gene by mir- <dig> as a positive control  <cit> , and the larp4/let- <dig> pair, which was extracted up to step  <dig> in our analysis, was chosen as a non-evolutionarily conserved pair. we subcloned the 3'-utr sequence downstream from the renilla luciferase gene  and co-transfected  <dig> ng of the 3'-utr reporter construct into hela cells using  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> pmol of mirna mimics  . we observed the downregulation of six out of six candidates and of the positive control compared with the negative controls . typical results of the reporter gene assay are shown in figure 4b for the indicated amounts of mirnas . the downregulation of these candidates was significant , although some of these pairs represented an inhibition of only 30% under the current conditions. among these candidates, tagln <dig> was previously suggested to be downregulated by mir- <dig>  as assessed by microarray analysis  <cit> . this feature was recently confirmed using the "pulsed stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture"  method and a reporter gene assay  <cit> . regarding the let-7/larp <dig> combination, the expression of larp <dig> was not downregulated after let- <dig> transfection, which was supported statistically . these experimental results suggest that our new method has the potential for efficiently extracting reliable mirna/target-gene pairs and may be effective in the elucidation of the primordial regulatory relationships between mirnas and their target genes during the early stage of bilaterian evolution.

possible regulation of evolutionarily conserved mirna targets in bilaterian animals
to provide further insight into the primary functions of evolutionarily conserved mirnas , we next focused on the functions of the target genes and found that evolutionarily conserved mirna/target genes could be largely classified into four functional categories: development, differentiation, muscle movement, and gene regulation. first, we describe the function of evolutionarily conserved genes involved in development and differentiation. the laminin subunit gamma- <dig> precursor  gene, which was possibly regulated by mir- <dig>  is one of the major components of the basement membrane. according to smyth et al.  <cit> , null mutation of lamc <dig> causes embryonic lethality because of the absence of the basement membrane and failure to differentiate the endoderm. among other candidates regulated by mir- <dig>  the expression of the leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein  <dig>  gene induces an extra axis in xenopus laevis embryos  <cit> . moreover, the semaphorin-6d precursor  gene, plays an important role in cardiac morphogenesis during chick embryonic dev which was predicted as a candidate of mir- <dig> targeting, elopment  <cit> . the lin- <dig> gene, which regulates developmental timing in c. elegans, is reportedly controlled by lin- <dig>  as assessed using in vivo experiments  <cit> . subsequently, the lin- <dig> gene was also found to be regulated by mir- <dig>  which is an orthologous mirna of lin- <dig>  in h. sapiens and m. musculus  <cit> . our prediction confirmed the regulation of orthologous lin- <dig> genes by lin-4/mir- <dig> mirna in h. sapiens, m. musculus, and c. elegans and further suggested that a similar regulatory relationship was conserved in g. gallus. interestingly, our prediction showed that the orthologous let-7/lin- <dig> pair was also evolutionarily conserved among bilaterians. this feature had been validated experimentally in h. sapiens  <cit> ; however, in c. elegans, lin- <dig> is expressed in an early stage of development, while let- <dig> is expressed in a later stage of development, suggesting that regulation of lin- <dig> by let- <dig> is subtle in c. elegans  <cit> . it would be of interest to analyse the interaction of the let-7/lin- <dig> pair in other species, such as m. musculus and g. gallus, to understand whether stage-specific expression of let- <dig> was present in the common ancestor of bilaterian animals or if it is a trait acquired later during evolution, as many of the evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs were related to an essential function involved in differentiation and development.

next, we focused on the tissue-specific mirna/target genes. among the  <dig> evolutionarily conserved target candidates, approximately one-third were expressed in a tissue-specific manner in humans, according to the biogps portal http://biogps.gnf.org. mir- <dig> is highly expressed in muscle tissues  <cit> . here, three candidate genes regulated by mir- <dig>  are also expressed in muscle tissues, according to biogps. tagln <dig> is a homolog of tagln, which encodes an actin-binding protein and is a diagnostic marker of breast and colon carcinoma in humans  <cit> . the cnn <dig> gene also encodes an actin-binding protein that represses bone morphogenetic protein  signalling in chondrocytes, which is important for bone formation  <cit> . moreover, the tpm <dig> gene encodes yet another actin-binding protein that modulates muscle contraction. the other mirna, mir- <dig>  is expressed in the nervous system  <cit> . similarly, one of the evolutionarily conserved target candidates, the glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase  <dig>  gene, is expressed in the central nervous system  <cit> . in addition, the annexin a <dig>  gene, which is another candidate target of mir- <dig>  is involved in the development of the murine brain  <cit> . the striking overlap between the tissue specificity of evolutionarily conserved mirna and that of their target genes suggests that one of the main functions of primordial mirnas may have been the regulation of genes implicated in the temporary control of the development of muscle and of the nervous system, in a tissue-specific manner.

finally, we found two interesting candidate genes, eif2c <dig> and larp <dig>  which encode translation-related proteins. it is well accepted that mirnas are regulators of gene expression, mostly at the translational level  <cit> . eif2c <dig> is also known as argonaute  <dig> . although the function of ago <dig> is unknown, other argonaute protein family members are involved in the rna-induced silencing complex , which is essential for the mirna or sirna pathways. a previous microarray analysis performed in hepg <dig> cells revealed that the eif2c <dig> gene was affected by let- <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated for the first time the direct downregulation of eif2c <dig> by let- <dig>  as assessed using a reporter gene assay in hela cells ; therefore, we speculate that negative-feedback regulation of eif2c <dig> by let- <dig> exists in the mirna pathway. it has been reported that regulation of the ago <dig> mrna, which is a major component of the risc complex, in the mirna pathway by mir- <dig> controls plant development in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . another candidate, larp <dig>  encodes a member of la-motif protein family that controls translational efficiency  <cit> . we also demonstrated the downregulation of the larp <dig> gene via mir- <dig> using a reporter gene assay , which further supports our contention that some of the evolutionarily conserved mirnas may play an important role in the regulation of translation by controlling the expression levels of translation factors and by negatively regulating their own mirna pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a procedure to extract potential evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs based on orthologous gene information from five bilaterian animals, and efficiently extracted  <dig> evolutionarily conserved mirna/target-gene pairs from  <dig>  pairs. we experimentally validated the downregulation of six candidate pairs  in hela cells, which suggests that our method using orthologous information was efficient in extracting evolutionarily conserved mirna target-gene candidates. our findings reveal that mirna target sites were conserved among various species, and demonstrate that especially let-7-, mir-1-, and mir-124-mediated gene regulation may have played an important role throughout evolution, in processes such as development, differentiation, and muscle movement. moreover, our results indicate that mirna-mediated translational regulation as well as tissue-specific expression of mirna/target-gene pairs may have already existed in the common bilaterian ancestor. in conclusion, our study will provide new insights into the early stages of mirna function.
