BACKGROUND
the causative agent of lyme disease, borrelia burgdorferi, is introduced into a mammalian host via tick bite, whereupon the organisms enter the skin, disseminate hematogenously, and persist in the presence of a strong host immune response  <cit> . the dissemination and persistence of b. burgdorferi within a mammalian host is thought to be predicated, at least in part, on the organism's ability to bind molecules of the extracellular matrix   <cit> , inasmuch as these interactions have been shown to be important for other bacterial pathogens  <cit> . among various ecm components, b. burgdorferi binds to type i collagen  <cit> , fibronectin  <cit> , integrins  <cit> , the proteoglycan decorin  <cit> , and glycosaminoglycans   <cit> . the b. burgdorferi proteins described as ecm-binding proteins include bbk <dig>  <cit> , bgp   <cit> , p <dig>   <cit> , decorin-binding protein  a, and dbpb  <cit> . these proteins, and perhaps other as yet unidentified molecules, may play a significant role in the infectivity and pathogenesis phenotypes of b. burgdorferi.

our laboratory has been interested in dbpa as a vaccine candidate for the prevention of lyme disease and the contribution of dbpa and dbpb to b. burgdorferi pathogenesis and infectivity  <cit> . since their in vitro characterization as decorin-binding proteins  <cit> , the dbpa and dbpb lipoproteins have been implicated as potential contributors to adhesion and colonization of b. burgdorferi within mammalian hosts  <cit> . the genes that encode dbpa and dbpb reside in an operon, dbpba, on linear plasmid  <dig>  and are found within many b. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates  <cit> . neither protein is expressed by b. burgdorferi within the tick vector  <cit> , however, expression of dbpa  is upregulated in the mammalian host after ticks deposit spirochetes into the skin  <cit> . dbpa and dbpb expression likely remains high for the duration of mammalian infection, as inferred by the presence of antibodies against both antigens in the serum of mice as late as one year after infection . the presence of antibodies against dbpa in the serum of patients with late-stage, disseminated lyme disease also is well-documented  <cit> , providing added support for dbpa expression by b. burgdorferi during chronic infection.

although the combined data to date suggest an important role for the decorin-binding proteins of b. burgdorferi during mammalian infectivity, virtually all data inferring the importance of dbpa and dbpb thus far have been indirect. the first direct investigation into the role of the dbpba operon in the infectious lifecycle of b. burgdorferi was carried out by shi et al  <cit> . in this study, mutational analysis of dbpba in b. burgdorferi strain b <dig> indicated that neither dbpa, nor dbpb was essential in the murine needle-challenge infection model of borreliosis. however, there was evidence suggesting that these mutants exhibited a modest level of attenuation in immunocompetent mice. unfortunately, a comprehensive 50% infectious dose  was not included in this report to further investigate this possible defect, nor was genetic complementation of the mutation performed. this latter point is of particular importance given the genetic plasticity of b. burgdorferi and the possibility that spontaneous loss of an endogenous borrelial plasmid might account for the apparent defect in this mutant. to more directly examine the role of both dbpa and dbpb in the murine/tick model of lyme disease, a dbpba-deficient mutant and a dbpa genetic complement of the mutant were generated in the infectious strain  <dig> of b. burgdorferi. phenotypic assessment of mouse needle infectivity by id <dig> analysis and ixodes scapularis tick colonization and tick-transmission capacity by the bb <dig> dbpba-mutant also were performed.

RESULTS
construction and characterization of a dbpba-deficient mutant
to assess the roles that dbpa or dbpb play in the infectivity and pathogenesis of b. burgdorferi, we created a dbpba-deficient mutant by allelic exchange of a pflgb-kan cassette for the majority of the dbpba operon . infectious bb <dig> was chosen for construction of the dbpba mutant because it is a human isolate  <cit>  and prior infectious mutants of this strain have been readily created  <cit> .

bb <dig> was electroporated with the suicide vector, pkhdbpako, containing a pflgb-kan cassette flanked by  <dig>  kb of dna on the left side of the dbpba operon and  <dig> bp of dna on the right side of the dbpba operon . this allelic exchange strategy relies on a double crossover, homologous recombination event to replace the dbpba operon with the pflgb-kan cassette. several kanamycin-resistant transformants were obtained, and the presence  and orientation  of the pflgb-kan cassette within the dbpba operon was confirmed by pcr analysis.

during genetic manipulation and in vitro cultivation, b. burgdorferi may spontaneously lose endogenous plasmids that are not required for growth in vitro, but are essential for mammalian infection. at least two plasmid-encoded genes, vlse  <cit>  and pnca   <cit> , fit this criteria. one kanamycin-resistant transformant, bbkh <dig>  retained both vlse and pnca  and was analyzed by immunoblotting to confirm the loss of dbpa and dbpb. as expected, dbpa and dbpb were absent from bbkh <dig> . bbkh <dig> exhibited identical doubling times when compared to wild-type bb <dig>  and pcr-based plasmid profiling revealed that the endogenous plasmid profile of bbkh <dig> matched that of the parent bb <dig> .

loss of dbpba significantly reduces the infectivity of b. burgdorferi in mice when introduced via needle inoculation
to determine the contribution of dbpa and dbpb to the infectivity of b. burgdorferi in mice, c3h/hej mice were challenged intradermally via needle inoculation with increasing numbers of bbkh <dig> . as a positive control, an additional five mice were inoculated with wild-type bb <dig> at a dose of  <dig> spirochetes . the results are shown in table  <dig>  whereas the mice infected with  <dig> of bb <dig> showed culture positive ear punch biopsies at two weeks post-infection, needle challenge of naïve mice with  <dig> bbkh <dig> did not produce an infection in any mouse , even when the infection was allowed to progress for  <dig> weeks. seventeen mice challenged with  <dig> and ten mice challenged with  <dig> bbkh <dig> also did not show signs of infection  at four weeks post-challenge . however, after  <dig> weeks, three mice from the group infected with  <dig> bbkh <dig> and two mice from the group challenged with  <dig> bbkh <dig> were shown to be infected by positive ear-punch biopsy cultures. additionally, mice were challenged with either  <dig> or  <dig> bbkh <dig> and ear-punch biopsies were harvested  <dig> weeks after infection . from the group that received  <dig> spirochetes, two mice were infected , and from the group that received 106spirochetes, four mice were infected . all of the mice challenged with  <dig> of bbkh <dig> had positive ear-punch cultures as early as five-weeks post-challenge, and as late as  <dig> weeks post-infection . these spirochetes from ear punch-positive cultures were analyzed by diagnostic pcr as described above, and confirmed to be bb <dig> or bbkh <dig> . aliquots of these cultures also were passed to media containing kanamycin to confirm resistance and sensitivity of bbkh <dig> and bb <dig>  respectively. seroconversion analyses performed on a subset of mice also revealed that none of the mice infected with bbkh <dig> showed antibody reactivity against dbpa or dbpb . furthermore, only mice that exhibited culture-positive ear punch cultures showed significant serum antibody reactivity with p <dig> . analysis of all infection results yielded an id <dig> for bbkh <dig> of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  compared with id <dig> of approximately  <dig> bacteria for wild-type bb <dig>  <cit> .

a mice were needle infected with varying concentrations of bacteria. infection rates were assessed at the noted timepoints by culturing bbkh <dig> from ear-punch biopsies.

b mice from  <dig> week timepoint represent groups distinct from the 5- and 10-week groups.

complementation of the dbpba-deletion mutant with dbpa restores infectivity in needle-challenged mice
the results above suggested that the dbpba operon is required for full infectivity of b. burgdorferi when mice are infected via needle inoculation. however, during genetic manipulation of b. burgdorferi, it is not uncommon to lose one or more plasmid which potentially contribute to infection, therefore genetic complementation is necessary to definitely ascribe the attenuated phenotype in bbkh <dig> to the dbpba lesion. although bbkh <dig> carries a mutation in both dbpa and dbpb, we chose to complement with only dbpa because i) dbpa is better characterized that dbpb  <cit>  and ii) experimentation suggests that dbpa is the prominent dbp in b. burgdorferi  <cit> . to restore dbpa expression in bbkh <dig>  a shuttle plasmid carrying a copy of dbpa driven by its native promoter was constructed . since dbpa is the second gene in the dbpba operon, we chose to clone the promoter for this operon upstream of the dbpa gene and then insert the fusion product in the multiple-cloning site of pjd <dig>  bbkh <dig> cells were transformed with this shuttle plasmid , yielding clones resistance to both kanamycin and streptomycin. these transformants were screened by pcr to verify the presence of the complementing plasmid . clones shown to contain the complementing plasmid were checked for vlse and pnca , as described above. pcr-based plasmid profiling, performed on one of the transformants that contained both pnca and vlse, revealed a profile identical to the parent strain, bbkh <dig> . this clone, designated bbkh <dig>  was selected for further analysis and dbpa expression was confirmed by both sds-page  and immunoblot analysis . proteinase k digestion of bbkh <dig> and bb <dig>  under conditions that left flab intact, demonstrated surface exposure of dbpa in both strains . three groups of five c3h/hej mice were needle inoculated  with bbkh <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> borreliae per mouse. ear punch biopsies were harvested at either two weeks  or three weeks ; all  <dig> mice became infected, as confirmed by positive ear-punch biopsy cultures. although a precise determination of the id <dig> of bbkh <dig> could not be calculated, the fact the 100% of the mice were infected with  <dig> bacteria suggests that the id <dig> is less than  <dig> spirochetes . aliquots of these cultures were passed to media containing streptomycin and kanamycin selection to confirm resistance. diagnostic pcr also confirmed that the spirochetes growing out of the ear punch biopsy were bbkh <dig> . seroconversion analyses carried out on a subset of mice also revealed that the mice infected with bbkh <dig> showed antibody reactivity against dbpa, but not dbpb . these data confirm that dbpa is necessary for wild-type levels of b. burgdorferi infectivity in mice when introduced via needle inoculation, and that dbpb is dispensable for this aspect of the infectious process.

neither dbpa nor dbpb is required for acquisition of b. burgdorferi by ticks or infection of mice via tick bite
to determine whether i. scapularis ticks could acquire borreliae lacking dbpa and dbpb, naïve larvae were allowed to feed to repletion on mice infected with bbkh <dig> or on mice infected with bb <dig>  larvae were collected after feeding, allowed to molt, and the unfed nymphs were examined for the presence of b. burgdorferi by ifa; approximately  <dig> weeks had elapsed since these ticks had fed to repletion as larvae. microscopic examination of multiple fields revealed approximately one spirochete per field in the bbkh500-infected ticks , as opposed to 20– <dig> spirochetes per field in the bb297-infected ticks . all bb297-infected ticks examined were positive for b. burgdorferi. of the ticks that had fed on bbkh500-infected mice, 80% were positive for spirochetes.

because the ticks maintained strain bbkh <dig> through their molt, it was important to assess whether the loss of dbpa and dbpb affected b. burgdorferi transmission to mice via tick bite. to test this, five bbkh500-infected nymphs were placed on each of two naïve mice and ten bbkh500-infected nymphs were placed on each of six naïve mice. an additional two naïve mice received five bb297-infected ticks each. the ticks were allowed to feed to repletion, and at three weeks post-infestation, ear-punch biopsies were harvested from all mice. the ear-punch biopsies were cultured in bsk medium and the cultures examined by dark-field microscopy for the presence of b. burgdorferi. these results are shown in table  <dig>  one of the two mice infested with five ticks harboring bbkh <dig> was infected as demonstrated by a positive ear-punch culture, and four of the six mice infested with ten ticks harboring bbkh <dig> were infected. both of the mice on which the bb297-infected ticks fed had positive ear-punch biopsy cultures. these spirochetes were analyzed by diagnostic pcr as described above, and confirmed to be bb <dig> or bbkh <dig> . seroconversion analyses performed on a subset of the bbkh500-infected mice also revealed that none of the mice infected with bbkh <dig> showed antibody reactivity against dbpa or dbpb . furthermore, only mice that exhibited culture-positive ear punch cultures showed significant antibody reactivity against p <dig> . taken together, these data indicate that dbpa and dbpb are not essential for the transmission of b. burgdorferi from ticks to mice.

a varying number of ticks infected with bbkh <dig> were allowed to feed to repletion on naïve mice.

b infection rates were assessed at three weeks post-infestation by culturing bbkh <dig> from ear-punch biopsies

discussion
the importance of ecm-binding proteins to the pathogenic strategy of b. burgdorferi is not currently known. it is presumed that borreliae bind mammalian host cells during infection because binding to various ecm molecules and to tissue culture cells has been demonstrated in vitro  <cit> . of the known ecm-binding proteins of b. burgdorferi, bgp  <cit>  and bbk <dig>  <cit>  have been deleted from infectious strains n <dig> and b <dig>  respectively, and shown to be dispensable for infectivity in the mouse model of lyme disease. a deletion of integrin-binding protein, p <dig>  in a noninfectious strain of b. burgdorferi, hb <dig>  <cit> , caused the spirochetes to lose their ability to bind b3-chain integrins  <cit>  but the phenotype of a p <dig> mutant in an infectious strain of b. burgdorferi is currently unknown. the remaining two known ecm-binding proteins, dbpa and dbpb, were the focus of this work due to multiple lines of evidence suggesting a role for one or both proteins during infection of mammalian hosts  <cit> . to directly address the contribution of both dbpa and dbpb to b. burgdorferi infectivity, we created bbkh <dig>  a dbpba-deletion mutant of the human isolate bb <dig>  and used this strain to challenge mice with increasing numbers of spirochetes. we observed a 4-log reduction in infectivity of the mutant strain when the spirochetes were needle inoculated into mice. complementation of the dbpba-mutant with dbpa alone in the dbpba-mutant restored infectivity of b. burgdorferi to wild-type levels.

prior to this work, fischer et al.  <cit>  had restored dbpa and dbpb expression  to b. burgdorferi strain b <dig>  a non-adherent, noninfectious derivative of strain b <dig> that has lost several plasmids, including lp <dig>  <cit> . although expression of the dbp molecules restored binding of the spirochetes to purified decorin, dermatan sulphate, and human epithelial cells  <cit> , experiments to test the infectivity of b <dig> expressing dbpa and dbpb in the murine model of lyme disease were implausible due to the loss of plasmids that are required for mammalian infection  <cit> . a recent study by shi et al.  <cit>  assessed the infectivity of a dbpa,b mutant of b. burgdorferi strain 5a18np <dig>  a b <dig> derivative that lacks the bbe <dig> gene  <cit> . based on needle-challenge results obtained from a single inoculation dose of  <dig> bacteria , shi et al.  <cit>  ascertained that the dbpba locus was not required for infectivity. however, in the present study, we observed a 4-log increase in the id <dig> of bbkh <dig>  and a 19% infection rate with a dose of  <dig> bbhk <dig> when mice were infected by needle inoculation. the reason for the difference in infectivity levels of the dbpba-deficient mutants reported by shi et al. and bbkh <dig> created in our laboratory is unknown at this time. one possible explanation for this disparity could be due to our use of bb <dig> as the parental strain for the present mutational analysis, whereas shi et al.  <cit>  utilized a clonal derivative of b <dig> that is a bbe02-mutant. this variability also could be explained by spirochete enumeration differences prior to needle challenge. as mentioned in the methods, significant attention was given to the enumeration of bbkh <dig> prior to needle inoculation of mice.

it should be noted that during the course of the study described herein, a subsequent report on the role of dbpba was published by shi et al.  <cit> , which, unlike their previous study, included genetic complementation experiments. our current findings agree with those of this most recent report in that shi et al. also observed a 4-log increase in id <dig> values with their dbpba mutant  <cit> . in addition, shi et al. observed a defect in the ability of the dbpba mutant to colonize heart, joint and skin tissues, suggesting an overall deficiency in dissemination  <cit> . the observation that mice infected with bbkh <dig> showed a delay in infectivity  also suggests that bbkh <dig> might be attenuated with respect to its capacity to disseminate through the host. however, whereas we were able to compensate fully for the loss infectivity in the dbpba mutant by complementing with dbpa alone , shi et al. reported that both dbpa and dbpb were required to restore the infectivity of their dbpba mutant  <cit> . although the precise reason for this disparity is unknown at this time, there are several differences between the experimental approaches of these studies that might account for these differing results. first, it is possible that some intrinsic differences in the bacterial strains utilized might account for the variation observed between these two studies. specifically, as noted above, strain  <dig> was the parental strain used in the current study, and shi et al. utilized a highly-transformable clone  of strain b <dig> that lacks both lp <dig> and the virulence-associated plasmid lp <dig> as the background for their mutagenesis experiments  <cit> . second, the disparity in our results might be due to the use of different strains of mice in these two studies; c3h/hej mice were used in our study, whereas shi et al used balb/c  <cit> . this may be relevant because numerous studies have reported that experimental infection of c3h strains of mice with b. burgdorferi results in significantly different disease pathologies  <cit> , higher spirochetal loads in multiple tissues  <cit> , and different cytokine responses  <cit>  by comparison to similarly infected balb/c mice. although, it is difficult to precisely predict how the reported differences in pathogenesis observed in these two distinct murine backgrounds might be impacted by dbpa and/or dbpb during infection, it is reasonable to suspect that these differences might account for some of the disparity in the results of complementation experiments obtained in the aforementioned studies.

even though dbpa was required for full infectivity by bb <dig> in mice when introduced by needle inoculation , neither dbpa, nor dbpb, was required for infection of larval i. scapularis ticks or for transmission of bbkh <dig> from infected ticks to naïve mice. that dbpa was not required for uptake of the spirochetes by larval ticks was not surprising due to our earlier work demonstrating that dbpa is not expressed by b. burgdorferi harbored within the tick vector  <cit> . however, based on the data we obtained from needle inoculation of mice with bbkh <dig>  it was surprising that as few as five nymphal ticks could transmit bbkh <dig>  this is especially surprising because semi-quantitative analysis of the total number of spirochetes observed in the midguts of unfed ticks infected with bbkh <dig> showed a lower spirochete density  by comparison to number of bacteria present in the dissected midguts of the bb297-infected ticks . while these data might suggest a possible defect in either the efficiency of acquisition of the dbpba mutant or the capacity of this mutant to persist in the tick midgut, there were still sufficient numbers of the mutant spirochetes in these ticks to infect naïve mice. since it is not known precisely how many spirochetes are transmitted by ticks during the feeding process  <cit> , it was impossible to directly compare the number of b. burgdorferi transmitted by tick bite to our needle-challenge experiments. spirochete numbers within salivary glands during tick feeding have been estimated between  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> spirochetes  <cit>  per salivary gland pair. these data suggest that an individual tick deposits far fewer than  <dig> spirochetes during the feeding process, and our results have shown that by the needle-inoculation route,  <dig> bbkh <dig> are not infectious.

in addition to the data presented by fischer et al.  <cit> , additional reports have attempted to address the role of dbpa, dbpb, and the ecm proteoglycan, decorin, with respect to the infectivity and pathogenesis of b. burgdorferi. brown et al. described b. burgdorferi infection of decorin-deficient mice   <cit> . brown et al.  <cit>  found that, by comparison to dcn+/+ mice, dcn-/- mice challenged with a higher dose of b. burgdorferi  had i) fewer infected joints, ii) a reduction in the severity of arthritis, but iii) no significant defect in colonization of the other tissues. whereas  <dig> wild-type b. burgdorferi were infectious for dcn-/- mice in the studies by brown et al.  <cit> , the bb <dig> dbpba-mutant was unable to infect mice at this dose. when considered together, these data support the hypothesis that dbpa, in addition to binding decorin, may have an additional ligand or has another function critical for infectivity. at the present time, the only other known ligand recognized by dbpa is the gag dermatan sulfate  <cit> , but the contribution of this interaction to the pathogenesis of b. burgdorferi remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the disparities between the results of the complementation experiments described in the current study and those obtained by shi et al.  <cit> , the overall results of our needle-inoculation experiments are in agreement with the most recent conclusion of shi et al. that mutation of dbpba results in significant attenuation of b. burgdorferi in the murine model of lyme borreliosis. however, the observation that the dbpba mutant showed a significant reduction in infectivity when the mice were needle inoculated is overshadowed by the finding that this same mutant was capable of infecting mice via tick challenge. the fact that dbpa and dbpb are dispensable for infection via the tick-mediated route of infection suggests that b. burgdorferi transmitted via tick bite are in some way phenotypically different than their in vitro-cultivated counterparts, and/or that tick-derived salivary components, such as salp <dig>  may assist b. burgdorferi during the early infection process  <cit> . taken together, these results emphasize the importance of characterizing the impact of a given gene in the infectious lifecycle of b. burgdorferi using the natural tick vector, as opposed to using only the artificial needle-challenge model.
