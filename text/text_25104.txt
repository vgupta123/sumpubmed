BACKGROUND
plants inevitably interact with climatic factors and are often subjected to different types of biotic and abiotic stresses. environmental stress conditions, such as those related to drought, flooding, salinity, cold, heat, chemical substances derived from human activities and pathogens, have adverse effects on plant growth and crop yields  <cit> .

temperature is one type of stress that greatly affects crop production around the world; however, additional stress factors may also act either separately or simultaneously and ultimately place the plant under combined stresses, causing cell damage and the production of secondary stresses, such as osmotic or oxidative stress  <cit> . as part of a biological system, plants are also attacked by different pests and pathogens. the diseases caused by root nematode parasites belonging to different genera, such as meloidogyne spp., and the fungus phakopsora pachyrhizi, which causes asian soybean rust disease  <cit> , have been contributing to decreases in soybean yields, especially in tropical and subtropical regions.

plants are sessile organisms that are not able to avoid exposure to adverse effects. however, they can supplant such exposure through the evolution of different morphological, molecular and physiological mechanisms or adaptations  <cit> . heat shock proteins are often associated with plant responses to cold stress, heavy metals and reactive oxygen species   <cit> . heat shock proteins  have also recently been found to be associated with the plant response to infection by pathogens such as nematodes  <cit> , bacteria  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . the signals or specific factors that trigger the expression of hsps genes during biotic stress are currently unknown, but the metabolic changes resulting from pathogen attack can generate similar signals or stimuli as those observed under abiotic stress activation  <cit> .

the hsps were first identified in drosophila melanogaster in the response to heat shock stress  <cit> . these proteins are grouped into high molecular weight protein families, comprising the hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp70/dnak and hsp60/groe, and low molecular weight families, including heat shock protein  <dig>  or small heat shock proteins  of 15– <dig> kda  <cit> .

the hsp <dig> proteins are atp-independent molecular chaperones that usually form oligomeric protein complexes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> subunits  and act by avoiding protein denaturation in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells  <cit> . these chaperones can also assist other chaperones in helping to maintain the native conformation of nascent polypeptide chains and in reorganizing denatured proteins to their native conformation. the main characteristic of hsp <dig> proteins is a highly conserved 80– <dig> amino acid sequence referred to as the alpha crystallin domain  located in the protein’s c-terminal region. this domain is divided into two regions, n-terminal consensus i  and c-terminal consensus ii , which are separated by a hydrophobic region of variable length. moreover, the region upstream of the hsp <dig> coding sequence generally contains several repetitions of the 5′-ngaannttcnngaan-3′ ) sequence, which is recognized and activated by specific transcription factors, designated heat shock factors   <cit> .

plants have approximately four times more hsp <dig> genes than animals  <cit> . this genic and functional diversification could be a consequence of their sessile biology. these proteins are encoded by nuclear multigenic families and are located in different cellular compartments  <cit> . arabidopsis has  <dig> genes encoding hsp <dig>  grouped into  <dig> subfamilies based on their subcellular localization and homology, while  <dig> hsp <dig> genes have been described in populus trichocarpa and  <dig> in oryza sativa <cit> . other subfamilies have previously been described in other species, totaling  <dig> subfamilies in plants  <cit> .

recently, genetic evidence has revealed that chaperones play a fundamental role in plant immunity  <cit> . the chaperone activity of heat shock proteins during biotic stress has been shown to be important for the stability and accumulation of resistance proteins  and for the coordination of the entire defense signaling cascade  <cit> . thus, hsp <dig> activity is especially important in crops such as soybean, which are cultivated in large areas around the world and constantly subjected to severe and variable stress conditions. moreover, soybean is one of the most important crops for providing both animal feed protein and human cooking oil  <cit>  and has an important impact on the brazilian economy  <cit> . however, nothing is currently known about the glycine max heat shock protein  <dig>  family, and only one hsp <dig> gene that is responsive to biotic stress has been identified in soybean. this gene was mapped to a quantitative trait locus  responsible for meloidogyne javanica resistance and found to be differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes  <cit> .

given the evidence regarding plant hsp20s and their functional diversification, these proteins are considered ideal targets for improving the development of new varieties of soybean that are tolerant to a wide range of stress conditions or combinations of these stresses. thus, the main objectives of this study were to identify gmhsp <dig> gene family members and carry out their molecular characterization, focusing on the regulation of their expression under different biotic and abiotic conditions, genome distribution and putative promoter structure.

RESULTS
identification and classification of the soybean hsp <dig> gene family
hidden markov model  analysis and name search resulted in the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> gene models from the superfamily  <dig>  and phytozome v <dig>  soybean databases, respectively. after removing overlapping hits,  <dig> putative gmhsp <dig> were retrieved. prosite and meme scans of these sequences confirmed the presence of an acd in  <dig> of the  <dig> gene models. however, these acd were identified in the c-terminal region of only  <dig> of the putative gmhsp <dig> gene models .

three of the putative gmhsp <dig> with an irregular acd disposition  were also considered potential gmhsp <dig> members because their induction under hs has been previously observed   <cit> . the other  <dig> candidates eliminated from the analysis due to the position of the acd and their absence in previous expression studies available in the expression databases. besides, the blastp analyses to these first  <dig> excluded genes also showed that seven genes were similar to unknown or not characterized proteins. one gene showed similarity to a predicted tropinone reductase from soybean. the remaining genes showed a low identity to plant hsp <dig> genes.

using the set of  <dig> gmhsp <dig> candidates, we searched for those candidates that had been detected in previous general gene expression experiments . this search resulted in a total of  <dig> likely candidates . all  <dig> gmhsp <dig> candidates showed at least one repetition of the putative hse in the 500bp, or  <dig>  bp its applied, promoter region . thus, all of these potential candidates were considered in silico-predicted gmhsp <dig> genes.

complexity and organellar localization of the soybean hsp <dig> genes
a phylogenetic tree constructed via alignment of the acd amino acid sequence of the  <dig> in silico-identified gmhsp <dig> candidates made it possible to divide them into  <dig> of the  <dig> described hsp <dig> subfamilies . based on the phylogenetic tree and in silico subcellular localization analysis, we identified soybean hsp <dig> members related to the previously defined ci, cii, ciii, civ, mi, p, er and px subfamilies as well as to the recently identified cv, cvi, cix, cxi and mii subfamilies  <cit> . in addition, we identified three orphan genes, two of which  clustered with the arabidopsis athsp14- <dig> cvii subfamily and were found to be heat responsive in our in vivo analysis; however, the cluster bootstrap value was low . the third orphan gene was gmhsp <dig> a .

thus, the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> genes were distributed among a total of  <dig> subfamilies as follows:  <dig> were nucleo-cytoplasmic  hsp <dig> genes ; three were mitochondrial  hsp <dig> genes ; four were endoplasmic reticulum  hsp <dig> genes, five were plastidial  hsp <dig> genes and two were peroxisomal  hsp <dig> genes.

in addition to phylogenetic analysis and prediction of subcellular localization, the prediction of protein secondary structure models for gmhsp <dig> subfamilies is important for determining the subfamily distribution . subfamilies ci and cii contain amino terminal α-helices and a variable number of β-sheet segments, seven segments in ci members and six in cii members . subfamily ciii is very similar to cii, except that all members of the ciii subfamily exhibit one intron in the acd and another in the third β-sheet segment. in addition, the ciii gmhsp <dig> genes present an intron in the 5′utr region. cytoplasmic subfamily civ contains seven β-sheet segments and two α-helices in the acd. subfamily cv exhibits a conserved pattern in relation to the secondary structure observed in rice and arabidopsis, where the presence of an intronic region just after the second β-sheet in the acd is a peculiar feature.

the most important characteristic of the secondary structure of the er gmhsp <dig> subfamily is the presence of two large β-sheets and an α-helices in the n-terminal region, where a signal peptide was also predicted. the two mitochondrial subfamilies contain four to five α-helices and one β-sheet in a small segment of the n-terminal region. in mi subfamily members, seven small β-sheet segments were identified, while only five segments were identified in the mii subfamily members. the profiles of mi and mii regarding the position of the acd in the c-terminal region and the occurrence of an intron in the center of the protein are unique among the gmhsp <dig> families. a diagrammatic representation of the hsp <dig> subfamilies showing the acd region, intron positions, transit peptides and secondary structures is presented in figure  <dig> 

an amino acid sequence alignment of the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> proteins showed that the identity among the sequences varies from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the highest values were detected in the c-terminal region corresponding to the acd, while the lowest values were observed between members of different subfamilies.

the motive analysis of the hsp candidates reveled that among the  <dig> possible gmhsp <dig> genes,  <dig> were intronless, while  <dig> contain only one intron, and seven showed exhibit two introns or more. the intron occurrences were validated in two gene models using conventional pcr. dna amplification of gmacd <dig>  and gmacd <dig>  confirmed the presence of intron fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, because cdna amplification produced the expected amplicon as predicted via genome annotation using the phytozome database .

the predicted molecular weights of the gmhsp <dig> candidates were distributed in a range from  <dig>  kda  to  <dig>  kda . the predicted isoelectric points of the gmhsp <dig> candidates were between  <dig>   and  <dig>  . interestingly, the predicted instability indices showed that only  <dig> of the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> candidates could be considered stable proteins  .

genome organization and gene duplication
the  <dig> putative hsp <dig> gene candidates are distributed across  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes in the soybean genome. no gmhsp <dig> genes were detected on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  interestingly, closely related sequences of the ci subfamily clustered together in the phylogenetic tree and are mainly located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that the expansion of this gene family may have occurred via localized or intra-chromosomal duplication.

four hsp <dig> paralog gene groups were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, duplication with a high similarity  was detected between gmhsp <dig>  in the terminal region of chromosome  <dig> and gmhsp <dig>  at the same region of chromosome  <dig>  gmhsp <dig>  also shared a similarity of 80% with gmhsp <dig>  . gmhsp <dig> e on chromosome  <dig> also showed a likely  duplicated region shared with gmhsp <dig> a on chromosome  <dig>  both of which are located on the upper arm of chromosomes. finally, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contain three putative duplications, one presenting 82% similarity, involving two of the four genes classified in subfamily p. the duplication prediction analysis indicated that the evolution of the hsp <dig> gene family in the soybean genome resulted from a total of  <dig> gene duplications, five of which were segmental among four chromosomes .

gmhsp <dig> expression under heat shock and cold treatments
to validate the  <dig> putative gmhsp <dig> candidates under stress, we investigated their in vivo expression profiles in heat shock and cold experiments. out of the  <dig> primers designed for these individual gmhsp <dig> genes,  <dig> produced only one amplicon and were used in this analysis. in addition, two gene models resulting from the database exploration analyses that showed a high homology with rice acd genes were also analyzed.

among the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> candidates analyzed in vivo,  <dig> showed strong induction under heat shock, which was easily visualized using conventional pcr . the expression of all candidates under heat shock treatment was quantified via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  . based on the obtained results, four of the gmhsp <dig> candidates  and two acd genes  were not induced significantly in stressed soybean roots compared with the control conditions. to check whether these gene models were induced in another part of the plant exposed to heat shock, we also performed a qrt-pcr analysis using foliar samples, but no induction was detected.

as expected, cold stress showed a weaker influence on gmhsp <dig> expression compared with the heat treatment. under cold conditions, only five genes were responsive. gmhsp <dig> a, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> c and gmhsp <dig>  were induced, while gmhsp <dig>  was down regulated; the first two genes belong to ciii and the others to the ci, er and p subfamilies, respectively. all five genes were also induced under the heat stress treatment.

gmhsp <dig> expression under m. javanica infection and differences in resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes
the expression of the  <dig> putative gmhsp <dig> candidates was also monitored in soybean plants inoculated with m. javanica as a biotic stress model. the qrt-pcr analysis following the biotic stress treatments resulted in the identification of six responsive gmhsp <dig> genes and one gmacd gene . five of the six gmhsp <dig> genes induced by heat shock stress, gmhsp <dig> , gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b and gmhsp <dig> b, were also significantly induced in at least one of the biotic stress treatments tested, while the other hsp <dig> gene, gmhsp <dig> , exhibited induction that was detectable only at  <dig> days post-inoculation  and was not responsive to heat shock stress. gmhsp <dig>  was induced at  <dig> dpi and repressed at  <dig> dpi in brs  <dig>  while gmhsp <dig> b was repressed at  <dig> dpi . four genes, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> , gmhsp <dig> b and gmacd <dig> , were induced only at  <dig> dpi in brs  <dig>  while gmhsp <dig> b was induced at both  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi.

when the nematode-induced gmhsp <dig> genes were compared between the two soybean genotypes, four gene models showed a differential expression profile: gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b and gmhsp <dig> . gmhsp <dig> b and gmhsp <dig> b were induced in the susceptible genotype : the former at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and the latter only at  <dig> dpi. interestingly, both gmhsp <dig>  and gmhsp <dig> b were down-regulated in brs  <dig> at  <dig> dpi and up-regulated in the resistant genotype  at  <dig> dpi . the complete arrangement of the genes according to their expression profiles after the treatments can be seen in the venn diagram provided as additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the analysis of disease resistance qtl locations in the soybean genome using data on corresponding molecular markers  confirmed a strong bond between these sites and the hsp <dig> genes. at least, one qtl appears to be related to  <dig> of the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> gene candidates . among the qtls reported in soybase that are related to nematode and fungal disease resistance,  <dig> qtls were found to be physically located near to, in approximately  <dig> mb flanking regions, at least one gmhsp <dig>  the gmhsp <dig> a gene, reported by kandoth et al.  <cit>  to be related to heterodera glycines infection, was identified as being located near a qtl for resistance to such infection . the gmhsp <dig> a, gmhsp <dig>  and gmhsp <dig> b genes are also situated near qtls involved in biotic stress.

characterization of putative cis-elements in gmhsp <dig> promoters induced by abiotic and biotic stresses
the  <dig> hsp <dig> candidates were also evaluated regarding the occurrence and distribution of putative cis-elements in their promoter regions. for this analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> in silico-predicted candidates, plus two gmacd genes, were considered based on the availability of promoter regions in phytozome . the promoter regions exhibit a characteristic consensus tata box, which was identified in  <dig> members, followed by putative hses that are present in all  <dig> genes, ranging from one to four repeats . the putative hses are mostly concentrated approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site. exceptions to this pattern were found  in which a single putative hse was identified, occurring approximately  <dig> bp or more upstream .

the ccaat, tata box, w-box and ta-rich positions identified  <dig> bp upstream of the gmhsp <dig> candidates are estimated in relation to the transcription start site. a the results are presented according to meme, matinspector and place software. the ta-rich elements were obtained using the program plantcare. the abbreviation “n/a” means that the upstream region is not available on phytozome.

other elements known to function as cis-elements in hsp <dig> genes, such as caat box, w-box and ta-rich regions, were also predicted at variable positions  <cit> . a putative caat box was detected in  <dig> genes and a putative w-box in  <dig>  among the gmhsp <dig> genes identified in this study as being responsive to nematode infection, four showed at least one putative w-box site: gmhsp <dig> , gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b and gmhsp <dig> b. all four of these genes were induced by high temperature .

a putative ta-rich region was present at different positions, especially in the promoters of the hsp <dig> genes induced by biotic stress. these regions were found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site of the genes gmhsp <dig> a 12), gmhsp <dig> b 9), gmhsp <dig>  13), gmhsp <dig> b 6) and gmacd <dig>  8), respectively. three of these genes, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig>  and gmhsp <dig> b, were induced in soybean roots after heat stress or infection with m. javanica in our experiments based on qrt-pcr analysis. gmhsp <dig> a was not induced in our biotic experiments but has previously been described as being responsive to h. glycines <cit> .

overall, it was possible to identify an organization pattern of the putative cis-elements in the promoters of the six gmhsp <dig> candidates that were responsive to nematode infection. caat boxes presented a heterogeneous distribution ranging from two to five repetitions within the region containing putative hses or immediately upstream, while putative w-boxes were located more distantly, upstream of the putative hses. in all six gmhsp <dig> genes, the first putative hse is located within the first − <dig> bp upstream of the start site, while the putative hse was followed by at least one putative caat box. at least one putative w-box was identified in four of the six gmhsp <dig> genes  induced by nematodes, but they were all at different positions  .

gmhsp <dig> putative operational promoter models
the results of the in silico analysis and in vivo expression profiling of the gmhsp <dig> candidates under biotic and abiotic stress conditions were used to determine a putative transcription factor binding site  combinatorial models for their promoters. comparative analysis of the promoters of the five gmhsp <dig> genes responsive to cold stress  resulted in five putative operational models containing the mandatory heat element. other putative common elements were l1bx, ahbp, gtbx, vtbp, mybs, mycl, mybl and abre .

analysis of the promoters of the six gene candidates induced by biotic stress , gmhsp <dig> , gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> b and gmhsp <dig> , resulted in the identification of three putative models, all of which included the mandatory putative heat element and the putative elements ahbp, gtbx, vtbp, mybs, wbxf and caat.

discussion
based on a genome-wide analysis, we propose that the soybean genome is enriched in small heat shock genes, presenting  <dig> hsp <dig> genes, compared with the  <dig> and  <dig> hsp <dig> genes observed in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . this greater expansion of the hsp <dig> gene family in soybean was expected because the soybean genome has experienced successive duplications throughout its evolution  <cit> . according to our analysis, a total of  <dig> gene duplications of the hsp <dig> family can be predicted to have occurred in the soybean genome. as reported above, the vast majority of the gmhsp <dig> genes  were strongly induced by heat treatment , which suggests that our in silico pipeline for predicting gmhsp <dig> candidates was efficient. three of the gmhsp <dig> candidates were expressed only under non-stressed conditions, while gmhsp <dig>  was exclusively induced after m. javanica inoculation. these results indicate that some gmhsp <dig> genes exhibit functions that are unrelated to heat shock under normal growth conditions, for example, specific housekeeping activities, in addition to more specialized activities, such as in the response to biotic stress. this functional diversification of the hsp <dig> gene family has also been reported in sunflower and rice  <cit> .

in earlier attempts to categorize the subfamilies of arabidopsis hsp <dig> genes, it was proposed that the majority of the athsp <dig> could be divided into seven subfamilies  and that five other genes do not fall into any subfamily  <cit> . in a more recent analysis, the athsp <dig> gene family was extended to include  <dig> subfamilies based on placing the five uncategorized hsp <dig> genes into four new nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies  and adding a new mitochondrial subfamily, mii  <cit> . a recent categorization of the rice hsp <dig> gene family proposed a distribution of oshsp <dig> genes into  <dig> subfamilies: four nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies  plus  <dig> subfamilies already identified in arabidopsis <cit> ). gmhsp <dig> clustering with arabidopsis subfamily cvii and rice subfamilies cviii and cx was not observed in the present study when bootstrap values were considered. however, in the  <dig> remaining subfamilies, we were able to identify at least  <dig> members, two of which subfamilies have not yet been described in the literature. our results suggest that there are  <dig> nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies in soybean, the largest of which is subfamily ci, with  <dig> members .

the large number of gmhsp <dig> proteins classified into nucleocytoplasmic subfamilies is a feature shared with other species, such as arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , and indicates that the cytoplasm may be the primary site of action for hsp <dig> proteins. in the cytoplasm, where protein assembly occurs, a higher concentration of hsp <dig> proteins could prevent in appropriate folding or interactions that could lead to the formation of prejudicial aggregates.

notably, in the phylogenetic analysis, the hsp <dig> genes from different species that are classified in the same subfamily were observed to be more closely related than the members of the same species that belong to different subfamilies. this finding gave us an indication that synteny might exist among soybean, rice and arabidopsis hsp <dig> proteins. the hsp <dig> genes most likely had a common ancestor that gave rise to the different subfamilies before the diversification within these species  <cit> .

three soybean genes  were not grouped into any of the known hsp <dig> subfamilies . among these so-called orphan genes, gmhsp <dig> a was not responsive to heat shock stress, despite its high similarity with rice hsp <dig> -er, which is ht responsive .

regarding gene organization, 64%  of the soybean hsp <dig> genes are intronless based on genome prediction and qrt-pcr data, which is similar to the percentage reported for rice hsp20s   <cit> . few of the gmhsp <dig> genes contain introns, and their lengths are highly variable. the relationship between the occurrence of introns and the expression level of a gene is controversial  <cit> . in some studies, the absence of an intron, or a short intron length, has been found to enhance the level of gene expression in plants  <cit> . in addition, there are indications that during evolution, genes must be rapidly activated in response to stress tend to show a decreased intron density  <cit> . this may be the mechanism that has led to more rapid induction of the expression of plant hsp <dig> genes, which occurs within a few minutes after the initiation of heat shock  <cit> .

among the gmhsp <dig> genes containing introns,  <dig>  contain only one intron, and two  contain an intron in the 5′utr region; these two genes were induced by cold stress. according to kamo et al.  <cit> , the presence of an intron in the 5′utr region can potentiate the translation process.

furthermore, our results indicate that the gmhsp20s can be classified as unstable proteins, since  <dig> % of aminoacid sequence showed an unstable profile  . an unstable profile is believed to be a common feature among stress-induced proteins  <cit> . considering that hsp <dig> proteins are synthesized at a specific time in the cell, their instability indicates a rapid turnover that should allow transcriptional regulation of these proteins in the cellular environment  <cit> .

as expected, the gmhsp <dig> genes were preferentially located in terminal regions of the soybean chromosomes, which have been demonstrated to be enriched in genes in the soybean genome  <cit> . this localization might contribute to the occurrence of segmental duplications in the soybean hsp <dig> family. similarly, the genome duplications experienced by the soybean genome during its evolution and the high recombination rates between segmental regions of homologous chromosomes might have increased the occurrence of gene duplications  <cit>  and, consequently, favored the expansion and functional diversification of the gmhsp <dig> family. based on our analysis and the findings of schmutz et al.  <cit> , particularly their conclusions about soybean genome evolution and organization, we suggest that the evolution of the soybean hsp <dig> family has involved a total of  <dig> gene duplications, five of which were segmental on four different chromosomes . the same number of duplications has been reported for the rice genome, in which  <dig> oshsp <dig> genes were originated via duplication events  <cit> . these segmental duplications appear to have contributed significantly to increasing the number of members of the soybean ci subclass, located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in rice, the ci members are also distributed in clusters of segmental duplications  <cit> .

considering the concept of parsimony, the conservation of this pattern of hsp <dig> gene duplication within the same chromosome observed in the genomes of rice, arabidopsis and soybean most likely originated through segmental duplication events that occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots, in the ancestral species, followed by chromosomal duplications in both the ancestral species and within each species  <cit> . still, it is notable that three of the six gmhsp <dig> genes that are responsive to m. javanica and h. glycines infection  are organized in blocks of segmental duplications in the genome. in soybean, expansion of the segmental gene families associated with the basal resistance response is common and has been observed in families including nbs-lrr, f-box and auxin-responsive genes  <cit> . such duplications may contribute to the diversification of relevant alleles during plant-pathogen interactions or to the maintenance of similar levels of gene expression within the block, as observed in rice  <cit> . however, unlike the results reported by ouyang et al.  <cit> , the expression pattern of the tandem duplicated genes, under the stress conditions tested here, was observed to be highly heterogeneous for gmhsp <dig> 

based on the organization of the soybean genome, the number of hsp <dig> paralog gene groups observed between chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> corroborates their high synteny, as described by schmutz et al.  <cit> . furthermore, this organizational characteristic was observed between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> as well as between  <dig> and  <dig>  but  <dig> % of the length of chromosome  <dig> is still homologous to fragments of four other chromosomes  <cit> . the putative interchromosomal duplication observed between gmhsp <dig>  and gmhsp <dig> , located at the ends of the lower arms of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, is an example of the high rate of recombination between homologous chromatids in chromosome arm end regions.

our expression analysis showed that the regulation of soybean hsp <dig> genes is generally associated more with heat stress than with the other tested stresses. a total of  <dig> gmhsp <dig> candidates, including all of the organellar genes, were highly induced under heat shock stress in the roots and leaves, showing variation that ranged from four up to  <dig>  times higher expression at 42°c compared with the control condition. the hsp <dig> chaperone function under heat shock has been elucidated, but the functional roles of these proteins under other stresses or non-stress conditions have not been extensively worked out. the fact that these genes can be induced not only by heat shock but also under other stress conditions, as demonstrated in this study, reflects an interconnected mechanism of induction involving the hsfs. hsp <dig> genes are known to be specifically controlled by different hsfs, which is interesting considering that there are  <dig> soybean hsf genes, while other species have closer to  <dig> hsfs  <cit> .

the expression profiles of subfamily civ and gmhsp <dig> a differed from all of the other clustered nucleocytoplasmic gmhsp <dig> genes, mainly because they were not altered by ht, even when the leaves were tested. the tissue-specific expression patterns of hsp <dig> genes have been reported in different species. in arabidopsis, the expression profile of some athsp <dig> genes under heat shock shows great variation depending on the tissue tested  <cit> , while in rice, the expression profiles of the oshsp <dig> -cv and oshsp <dig> -cii genes were shown to be regulated differently in flowers and pistils, respectively  <cit> . in contrast, our results demonstrate very similar expression profiles of the gmhsp <dig> genes among the tissues analyzed under heat shock treatment .

the gmhsp <dig> , gmhsp <dig> b, gmhsp <dig> a and gmhsp <dig>  genes were induced by m. javanica in the susceptible genotype and have been described by kandoth et al.  <cit>  as also being responsive to h. glycines infection . similarly, four oshsp <dig> genes were found to be induced under the biotic stress of infection with m. grisea fungus  <cit> . similarity analysis revealed that the rice gene hsp <dig> a-ci is homologous to gmhsp <dig> b, suggesting that a functional role of this gene, being activated under pathogen infection, might be conserved. furthermore, two other genes  are clearly involved in biotic responses. in earlier attempts, gmhsp <dig> b was mapped to a qtl responsible for meloidogyne javanica resistance and displaying a differential expression profile in resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes  <cit> . in our analyses, gmhsp <dig>  was shown to be highly induced in the resistant genotype compared with the susceptible genotype; this gene has been described as being associated with the response to h. glycines infection in soybean  <cit>  and as being located near a biotic resistance qtl  .

in silico analysis of the gmhsp <dig> promoter were in line with previous results that reported the occurrence of putative hses within − <dig> bp from the transcription start site in hsp <dig> genes that are responsive to nematodes. five gmhsp <dig> genes induced by m. javanica followed this pattern described by barcala et al.  <cit>  . only gmacd <dig>  and gmhsp <dig> , which were induced by nematodes, did not exhibit this pattern.

in arabidopsis mutants for hsp <dig> genes involved in the responses to nematode infection, the tatabox element should be preferentially located between  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site, followed by an hse at around − <dig> bp and a ccaat box between  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site  <cit> . the promoter of one hsp <dig>  a caat box element was previously reported in the promoter region of hs <dig> pro- <dig>  a gene conferring complete resistance to h. glycines, and appears to be essential for site-specific regulation  <cit> . the promoters of all hsp <dig>  which are responsive to nematode infection, also show putative caat elements. moreover, the gmhsp <dig> biotic stress-responsive genes followed the same pattern observed in arabidopsis and sunflower and not observed in the others gmhsp <dig>  where the caat box always occurs either between the hses or immediately upstream of them, while the w-box, when present, is further upstream of the hse. however, previous studies have shown the function of these cis-elements in the hsp <dig> regulation in arabidopsis and sunflower, the involvement of them in soybean responses to nematodes need to be checked by in vivo experiments  <cit> .

ta-rich elements have been described as being directly involved in the regulation of the expression level of an hsp <dig> gene in response to nematode infection in soybean  <cit> , and they appear to act by altering the distances between other cis-elements, interfering with the strength of the promoter  <cit> . the number of ta repetitions in the promoter region of a soybean genotype resistant to m. javanica appears to be correlated, in a significantly higher level, with gmhsp <dig> b expression observed in response to this stress. the resistant plants contain  <dig> ta repetitions in the gmhsp <dig> b promoter region, while the susceptible plants have only nine  <cit> . our in silico analysis showed the occurrence of a putative ta region in the promoter regions of gmhsp <dig> responsive to m. javanica infection . it will be now interesting to investigate if these ta rich regions are really gmhsp <dig> cis-elements i.e., if the number of ta repetitions can be correlated to nematode resistance for these genes and if the deletion of ta region can interfere in gene expression.

two acd genes, gmacd <dig>  and gmacd <dig> , were not induced by heat shock in our analyses, and a sequence comparison showed that these genes exhibit high homology to the rice genes osacd <dig>  and osacd <dig> , respectively. the cellular roles of the acd genes are not very well established, but their homologs in rice and arabidopsis have been shown not to be involved inheat shock responsive   <cit> . these findings, combined with the irregular localization of acd at the n-terminal ends of the proteins, might suggest that these genes are not real hsp <dig> genes  <cit> . interestingly, however, both genes present a normal hse distribution in their promoters, and one of them, gmacd <dig> , was induced under biotic stress in the susceptible genotype. thus, it appears that the acd genes might play roles similar to the constitutive hsp <dig> genes or could be proteins that are involved in specialized functions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study makes a relevant contribution by identifying  <dig> potential genes that we suggest compose the soybean hsp <dig> gene family. the combination of in silico prediction strategies and in vivo expression analyses showed that the applied bioinformatic tools were very efficient in precisely identifying gmhsp <dig> family members. in addition, the gmhsp <dig> genes were divided among  <dig> of the  <dig> known plant hsp <dig> subfamilies and two additional unknown subfamilies that showed unique secondary structures and phylogenetic relationships between the soybean subfamily members and with members of the hsp <dig> gene families identified in other species. we have presented evidence of the genomic complexity and diversity of the expression of the soybean hsp <dig> gene family. the soybean hsp <dig> genes are distributed across  <dig> chromosomes, where gene duplication events have most likely resulted in expansion of the family, most notably for the ci subfamily. the vast majority of the hsp <dig> genes analyzed in vivo  were found to be strongly induced under heat shock, but other members of this family could be involved in normal cellular functions, which are unrelated to heat shock. among the gmhsp <dig> genes that were hsr, five were also identified as being involved in the soybean response to cold, and five others were responsive to meloidogyne javanica infection. furthermore, one predicted gmhsp <dig> was shown to be responsive to nematode infection, while no change in expression was observed under other conditions. these genes showed a divergent expression pattern between the examined resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes. the promoter region of the gmhsp <dig> members is minimally defined by the presence of a putative tatabox and one to three putative hses, but results obtained elsewhere suggest that other regulatory elements found in this study are also likely to be important, such as w-box, ccaat box sequences and ta-rich regions. the promoters that were responsive to biotic stress followed the same in silico predicted cis-element composition and distribution patterns that have been described for other species following nematode infection. moreover, further investigation is required to obtain clues regarding the functions of the individual genes identified in this study. the results presented here can be further analyzed to reveal candidate genes and promoter structures that will be useful in developing technologies that generate genotypes that are more resistant to the various stresses that affect soybean crops.
