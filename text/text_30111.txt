BACKGROUND
flavonoids and stilbenes are plant-specific natural products with a wide range of biological activities, such as uv protection, as signals of bacterial root nodulation, coloration and defense against herbivory and microbial pathogens <cit> . the uncovering of an increasing number of health benefits associated with these compounds has resulted in an explosion of research on their medicinal properties during the last few years <cit> . in particular, the stilbene compound resveratrol has received considerable attention for its potential medicinal properties  <cit> , and has been identified as a compound promoting increased lifespan through activation of sirtuin deacetylases <cit> , although the exact effect of resveratrol on sir <dig> family proteins remains controversial <cit> . less controversial is the effect of stilbenes on protein-tyrosine kinases, with piceatannol having been shown as a selective inhibitor of the human tyrosine kinase syk <cit> .

flavonoids and stilbenes are synthesized from a coenzyme a  activated phenylpropanoid starter unit and three malonyl-coa extender units . the first step in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is the deamination of l-phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid, catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase  . cinnamic acid is hydroxylated by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase   to make 4-coumaric acid, which is then activated by 4-coumaroyl:coa ligase   to make 4-coumaroyl-coa. a type iii polyketide synthase then sequentially adds three acetate extender units, derived from malonyl-coa, to a single activated 4-coumaroyl-coa starter unit. depending on the polyketide synthase activity, chalcone synthase  or stilbene synthase , subsequent folding and cyclization of the generated tetraketide intermediate results either in the production of a chalcone or stilbene ring structure.

expression of plant secondary metabolic pathways, including those for flavonoid and stilbene biosynthesis, are typically under tight temporal and spatial control  <cit> , which limits the availability of many medicinally important plant natural products. as an alternative biosynthetic host, microbial cells may be engineered for the production of plant derived natural products. in an attempt to access plant-derived flavonoid compounds in engineered microbial cells, we have previously shown that the arabidopsis thaliana flavonoid biosynthetic pathway can be functionally assembled in recombinant e. coli for the biosynthesis of flavonoids <cit> . here we describe the cloning of a stilbene synthase from arachis hypogaea  and its functional co-expression with two 4cl enzymes for the biotransformation of phenylpropionic acid precursors to modified stilbene compounds in e. coli. biotransformation of structurally diverse phenylpropionic acids using recombinant e. coli opens up the possibility to produce functionalized stilbene compounds without the need of additional biosynthetic enzymes that may be difficult to express functionally in e. coli, such as plant cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases. we observe for the first time production of two stilbene compounds by e. coli, with the stilbene resveratrol produced at a level of over  <dig> mg/l.

RESULTS
cloning and expression of a. hypogaea stilbene synthase 
stilbene synthases have been characterized from several plant species, including pinus sylvestris and a. hypogaea, both of which have structural data reported <cit> . for the purpose of synthesizing structurally diverse stilbene compounds in e. coli, we chose to use the sts from a. hypogaea because of its reported broad substrate specificity <cit> . peanut seeds were purchased from a commercial supplier and grown for approximately two weeks before preparation of cdna. two preparations of cdna were made, one from fully opened leaves and one from a combination of roots and root hairs together. the cdna's were probed with gene specific  primers, and a pcr product of the expected size  was only obtained from root cdna, whereas the leaf cdna gave no detectable amplification product . the root cdna pcr product was then cloned into the expression vector pucmod. this plasmid was constructed by deletion of the puc <dig> operator sequence, which results in constitutive expression from the lac promoter <cit> . the sequence obtained for puc-sts was found to match the published sequences of sts from peanut <cit> , but with several nucleotide changes. these changes were conserved in three clones sequenced, suggesting that the observed differences are the result of strain variation. these nucleotide changes caused a few silent mutations and nine changes in amino acid sequence .

expression of recombinant sts was determined by sds-page, and the protein showed the expected molecular weight of near  <dig> kda . when total cellular protein was separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by high-speed centrifugation, sts appeared to be almost entirely in the soluble fraction of the e. coli cell lysate, with a small amount found in the insoluble fraction . the high level of expressed soluble sts is surprising as many plant derived genes are not well expressed in e. coli without codon optimization to remove rare or unusual plant codons. a reduced growth temperature of 30°c may have increased the solubility of the recombinant protein <cit> . previous work on flavonoid biosynthesis in e. coli also revealed a significant decrease in product titers when cells were cultivated in media containing glucose due to decreased enzyme expression levels . to investigate whether this phenomenon was also important for recombinant stilbene biosynthesis, we cultivated e. coli puc-sts in modified m <dig> containing glucose instead of glycerol. expression of sts in glucose containing media was significantly lower , and was found exclusively in the soluble protein fraction .

biosynthesis of resveratrol in e. coli
during our previous studies on flavonoid biosynthesis in e. coli, we observed that e. coli expressing a partial flavonoid pathway, consisting of 4cl <dig> and chs, was able to take up exogenous 4-coumaric acid and synthesize naringenin <cit> . to identify conditions for the biotransformation of phenylpropionic acids to stilbenes in an analogous reaction with 4cl <dig> and sts, e. coli was grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of 4-coumaric acid. strain bw <dig> with empty plasmids  was used to mimic the culture conditions to be used later for stilbene biosynthesis. as shown in fig.  <dig>  no apparent growth inhibition was observed at  <dig> mm of added 4-coumaric acid as the growth curve closely follows that of the control culture without 4-coumaric acid at both  <dig> and  <dig> hrs of growth. however, inhibition of growth was observed at  <dig> mm, and at  <dig> mm of added 4-coumaric acid, the optical density  is reduced by approximately 38% after  <dig> hrs and 35% after  <dig> hrs. this effect is most likely due to 4-coumaric acid itself, rather than a drop in culture ph caused by the added phenylpropionic acid, as the ph of the cultures after  <dig> hrs did not change more than  <dig>  ph unit compared to the control culture. concentrations of 4-coumaric acid higher than  <dig> mm could not be easily reproduced due to precipitation of substrate in the culture media and on solid surfaces. based upon these results,  <dig> mm was chosen as the phenylpropionic acid concentration for all subsequent biotransformation experiments.

to examine the function of the peanut sts in e. coli, puc-sts was transformed, along with pac-4cl <dig>  into e. coli strain bw <dig> and grown in modified m <dig> media with glycerol. when the culture had grown to an od of  <dig> ,  <dig> mm 4-coumaric acid was added. after  <dig> hrs growth at 30°c, the culture was extracted and analyzed for the expected stilbene compound resveratrol. the hplc profile of the extract showed a peak with a retention time and uv spectrum identical to authentic resveratrol . control cultures of e. coli cells containing only pac-4cl <dig> without sts, and supplemented with  <dig> mm 4-coumaric acid, did not show the same peak. similarly, no resveratrol peak was detected in cultures of e. coli pac-4cl <dig> + puc-sts without added 4-coumaric acid. liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  analysis of this new compound showed a parent ion  mass matching an authentic resveratrol standard . this result demonstrates the first production of a stilbene compound in a bacterial host. flavonoid biosynthesis has previously been reported in e. coli <cit> , but engineered stilbene biosynthesis has not been reported in this organism. this work therefore extends the range of plant polyketides that can be produced in e. coli to include stilbenes. the production of resveratrol in e. coli also opens up the possibility of engineering pathways for modified stilbene biosynthesis. rational extension of the pathway with additional enzymes for methylation, glycosylation or prenylation will greatly expand the range of compounds that can be produced.

kinetics of resveratrol biosynthesis
e. coli pac-4cl <dig> + puc-sts was grown in shake flasks to determine growth and stilbene biosynthesis over time. cultures were grown in modified m <dig> with glycerol to an od of  <dig>  when  <dig> mm 4-coumaric acid was added. growth and product formation were subsequently followed for an additional  <dig> hours at 30°c. resveratrol biosynthesis began almost immediately after addition of 4-coumaric acid and proceeded very quickly until all 4-coumaric acid present in the culture was consumed after approximately  <dig> hrs . after  <dig> hrs of growth,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l resveratrol was detected in the culture media along with less than  <dig> mg/l 4-coumaric acid . while 4-coumaric acid appeared to be completely consumed in the reaction after  <dig> hrs, the maximum amount of resveratrol detected corresponds to  <dig> μm, equal to a 46% conversion yield . resveratrol levels decreased after reaching the maximum of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l at  <dig> hrs to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l after  <dig> hours, representing a 22% loss of extractable product over the course of  <dig> hours. the fate of the remainder of the 4-coumaric acid and the loss of extractable resveratrol are currently under investigation.

when this same experiment was repeated with modified m <dig> medium containing glucose, resveratrol production was substantially decreased. resveratrol levels again reached a maximum value after approximately  <dig> hrs, but the amount was reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l obtained with glycerol. this drop in resveratrol production is likely a consequence of reduced sts expression in glucose containing m <dig> medium , but could also be due in part to a transport phenomenon. phenylpropionic acids are known to induce expression of enzymes responsible for transport and catabolism  of these compounds in e. coli <cit> . additionally, expression of a regulatory protein  controlling hydroxycinnamate transport and catabolism  is subject to catabolite repression <cit> , suggesting that transport of phenylpropanoids into e. coli during growth in media containing glucose would be inhibited. this possibility is currently under investigation.

probing the biotransformation of diverse phenylpropionic acids by sts
to determine the range of compounds that could be produced in recombinant e. coli co-expressing 4cl <dig> and sts, two additional phenylpropionic acid compounds were tested as substrates: caffeic acid or ferulic acid . when e. coli pac-4cl <dig> + puc-sts was grown in medium containing  <dig> mm caffeic acid, a new peak was detected in a hplc chromatogram of the extract that was not present in an unsupplemented control culture. hplc retention time, uv spectrum and parent ion mass  of this new compound matched that of the stilbene piceatannol . detectable levels of piceatannol reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l after  <dig> hrs and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/l after  <dig> hrs of growth.

this result marks the first production of a dihydroxylated stilbene in a recombinant host. the production of a stilbene from a dihydroxylated precursor  is an important step in the further development of e. coli for stilbene biosynthesis as it circumvents the presumed cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase mediated hydroxylation of resveratrol. while the enzyme catalyzing this reaction has not been described in plants, in humans the reaction is catalyzed by a cytochrome p <dig>  cyp1b <dig> <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> enzymes have traditionally been difficult to functionally express in e. coli due to a lack of a compatible p <dig> reductase <cit> . while functional plant p <dig> expression in e. coli may ultimately be accomplished, as it has in yeast <cit> , it will most likely require extensive protein engineering efforts, such as translational fusions to compatible reductases <cit> . this finding also agrees with what has been seen in vitro with peanut sts and this substrate. while 4-coumaric acid was reported to be the preferred substrate for this enzyme , caffeic acid was also utilized to a small extent <cit> . the relative amount of piceatannol produced in vitro from caffeoyl-coa was approximately  <dig> fold lower than resveratrol produced from an equivalent amount of 4-coumaroyl-coa <cit> , and this is in close proximity to what is seen in vivo with our e. coli system.

the bulkier phenylpropionic acid substrate ferulic acid, which has one of the two hydroxyl groups present in caffeic acid methylated, did not yield the corresponding fully cyclized stilbene compound isorhapontigenin. instead, extracts from e. coli pac-4cl <dig> + puc-sts cultures supplemented with ferulic acid yielded two new peaks on hplc which were identified by mass spectrometry as the corresponding triketide  and tetraketide  lactone intermediates . the major peak observed in the ferulic acid supplemented culture extract, however, always corresponded to unconverted ferulic acid, indicating that either substrate utilization by 4cl <dig> in e. coli may be limiting or that the reaction of sts with feruloyl-coa is inefficient. in vitro, feruloyl-coa was reported to be converted to the corresponding stilbene, albeit at low levels <cit> . this suggested that the concentration of feruloyl-coa was limiting in e. coli due to the coa ligase 4cl <dig> 

substitution of 4cl <dig> with the feruloyl-coa ligase 4cl4
ferulic acid is known to be a poor substrate for the 4cl <dig> enzyme from a. thaliana used in our studies <cit> . however, a new 4cl <dig> homolog, 4cl <dig> from a. thaliana, was recently shown to preferentially use ferulic acid and sinapic acid as substrates <cit> . therefore, to investigate whether the substrate specificity of 4cl <dig> was a limiting step in stilbene biosynthesis from ferulic acid, 4cl <dig> was cloned and co-expressed with sts. when e. coli pac-4cl <dig> + puc-sts was grown in the presence of  <dig> mm ferulic acid, no detectable isorhapontigenin was found by hplc or lc-ms analysis . as with previous cultures expressing 4cl <dig> and sts, similar amounts of triketide and tetraketide lactones, and unconsumed ferulic acid, were detected. the presence of high levels of residual ferulic acid could indicate that the reaction of sts with feruloyl-coa is slow, causing an accumulation of feruloyl-coa, which can be converted back to ferulic acid by the action of a soluble thioesterase, as has been observed during attempts to purify aromatic coa thioesters from e. coli <cit> .

the result with 4cl <dig>  along with the previous result with 4cl <dig>  suggests that sts can use ferulic acid as a starter unit in vivo, but it is unable to properly extend and fold the intermediates formed, resulting in lactone derailment products. these triketide and tetraketide lactones are typically found with unnatural substrates in chs and sts in vitro assays. the presence of lactone derailment products demonstrates the ability of these enzymes to accept a wide range of starter units, but due to limitations in the size of the active site, they are not properly extended and/or folded, and the resulting intermediates are released <cit> . we have observed in vivo that chs can also use ferulic acid as a starter unit, and like sts, it does not properly fold the intermediates, producing only the lactone derailment products. mutants of chs designed to expand the active site cavity, expressed together with 4cl <dig> in e. coli, produce differing ratios of triketide and tetraketide lactones in vivo . this suggests that expansion of the sts active site cavity may similarly lead to mutants that can more readily accommodate the larger size of ferulic acid derived polyketide intermediates, and eventually produce the properly folded stilbene structure.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, biosynthesis of stilbene compounds by engineered e. coli was demonstrated. the medicinally important compound resveratrol was produced at a level of over  <dig> mg/l in about  <dig> hrs of growth, at which time 4-coumaric acid was no longer detectable. this is a significantly higher yield of resveratrol than the 1– <dig> μg/l levels previously reported for engineered saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . analysis of protein expression data suggests that the high level of soluble sts appears to be one likely reason for this observation. the quantity of the stilbene piceatannol produced from caffeic acid was also relatively high, around  <dig> mg/l. while the amount of resveratrol produced is quite high, the conversion yield is less than 50% from the added substrate 4-coumaric acid. this may be partially explained by the capability of e. coli to degrade aromatic acids, including phenylpropanoids <cit> . efforts are currently underway to elucidate the mechanisms of substrate disappearance in order to gain insight into phenylpropanoid transport and metabolism in e. coli.

ferulic acid was not converted to the corresponding stilbene structure, isorhapontigenin, by e. coli expressing 4cl <dig>  or a ferulic acid specific coa ligase, 4cl <dig>  in conjunction with sts. the use of 4cl <dig> was meant to overcome the poor utilization of ferulic acid by 4cl <dig>  but use of 4cl <dig> had no apparent effect on product formation. it would appear then that feruloyl-coa utilization by sts is the limiting step in the pathway. chs likewise does not produce a flavanone product from ferulic acid, but produces tri- and tetraketide lactones. restricting the active site cavity of chs with this substrate produces increased triketide lactone <cit> , suggesting that expansion of the active site may have the opposite effect. indeed, simple mutations in chs, and closely related enzymes, have resulted in dramatic changes in substrate specificity and product formation <cit> . since sts has been postulated to have evolved from chs <cit> , the ability to expand and modify the active site of chs may as well be possible in sts.

this work opens up alternative routes for the production of additional stilbene structures from phenylpropionic acid precursors using recombinant e. coli cells. through manipulation of the biosynthetic enzymes controlling product formation, and eliminating unwanted reactions within the host, improvements may be seen that result in efficient utilization of an expanded range of substrates.
