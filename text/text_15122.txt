BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  causes johne's disease in sheep, cattle, goats and other ruminant animals. this disease is chronic in nature with multiple years separating the initial infection from clinical stages of disease  <cit> . the details of the pathogenic mechanisms occurring during this long incubation period still need further study, but it has been demonstrated that map colonizes the small intestine through invasion of both m cells and epithelial cells  <cit> . the disease is of considerable economic significance to livestock industries, particularly the dairy industry.

generally, map is a genetically homogenous subspecies, especially among bovine, human and wildlife isolates  <cit> . however, three lineages of map have emerged following extensive molecular strain typing and comparative genomic studies-type i and type iii strains  and type ii  strains. the type iii strains were originally called intermediate strains and are highly similar genetically, and thus, difficult to distinguish from type i strains. early on, the type i  and type ii  strains were distinguished based on their molecular fingerprints using is <dig> polymorphism  <cit> , representational difference analysis  <cit> , mlssr typing  <cit>  and hsp <dig> sequencing  <cit> . on the other hand, type iii  was genotyped based on gyra and gyrb genes  <cit> .

in addition to these recently published genotypic distinctions between "s" and "c" strains of map, phenotypic differences have been noted since the middle of the last century  <cit> . more recently, motiwala et al.  <cit>  have shown transcriptional changes in human macrophages infected with map-c, human and bison isolates induce an anti-inflammatory gene expression pattern, while the map-s isolates showed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. furthermore, some of the ovine strains are pigmented  <cit> . the ovine and bovine strains likewise are distinct in their growth characteristics. the map-s strains are more fastidious and slower in their growth rate than the map-c counterpart. in contrast to map-c strains, the map-s strains do not grow readily on herold's egg yolk media or middlebrook 7h <dig> media that is not supplemented with egg yolk  <cit> . nutrient limitation will kill map-s strains but it is only bacteriostatic for map-c strains  <cit> . on the transcriptional level, rna extracted in low iron and heat stressed environments is divergent between map-s and map-c strains  <cit> . recently, iron storage in low iron conditions was only observed in the map-c strains but not map-s strains  <cit> . because of these well-documented phenotypic differences, we hypothesized that sequencing of the genomes of ovine isolates and comparing them to other genomes in the mac group could provide some clues for these host-specific variations.

the map-c strain k- <dig> was sequenced in  <dig> to obtain a complete genome  <dig>  mb in size  <cit> . it was subsequently found to possess an inversion due to misalignment that was resolved by optical mapping  <cit> . very recently, draft sequences of ten map isolates have been reported with the presence of two large duplications, especially among human isolates  <cit> . finally, another m. avium subspecies  has also been sequenced but not published as yet. this genome of subspecies hominissuis is  <dig>  mb in size and greater than 95% homologous to the map k- <dig> genome  <cit> . both of these genomes have served as reference genomes in the current project to assist in assembly, open reading frame  predictions, and annotation. with the help of next-generation sequencing and optical mapping, we were able to assemble a draft of the standard sheep strain of map s <dig> and compare its sequence to other clinical isolates from sheep or the k- <dig> strain. interestingly, several inversion regions and single nucleotide polymorphisms distinguished the map-s strains from their map-c counterpart. insights into the evolution of map strains have been gained through this analysis.

RESULTS
genome general features
pyrosequencing indicated that the map strain s <dig> has a circular chromosome with at least  <dig> , <dig> bp, a g + c content of  <dig> % and contains  <dig>  predicted open reading frames . the majority of these genes  were predicted  <cit>  to encode cytoplasmic proteins  involved in various cellular functions and a minority of extracellular proteins . the number of annotated genes in s <dig> was more than the bovine k- <dig> strain  due to the different annotation methods used on each genome  <cit> . however, like map k- <dig>  the s <dig> genome contains one rrna operon and  <dig> trna genes representing all  <dig> amino acids. a detailed comparison between map strains k- <dig> and s <dig> as well as the human, mah  <dig> is shown in table  <dig>  the de novo assembly of the compiled s <dig> genome had an average sequencing depth of  <dig> × in  <dig> scaffolds . when aligned to the k- <dig> sequence, over  <dig> of these scaffolds are separated by a sequence gap of less than  <dig> bp suggesting the small size of most gaps. furthermore, when gaps of  <dig>  kb or less were ignored, we were able to assemble the whole genome into  <dig> scaffolds. the two largest sequence gaps are between contig00150c and contig00149c, which is estimated at  <dig>  kb and the contig00082-contig00041c gap, which is estimated at  <dig>  kb. additional file 3: table s <dig> gives an overview of the ordered scaffolds.

analysis of the two additional genomes sequenced in this study  revealed more than 99% identity to the s <dig> genome sequence . a de novo assembly of these genomes sequenced using illumina platform produced an average sequence depth of  <dig> ×. as expected, no significant differences were found between the common features of the  <dig> sequenced sheep isolate genomes. in fact, there were no gene differences; hence all three genomes were identically annotated. similar to other sequenced mycobacterial genomes, dnaa was assigned the first locus tag .

ahomology% was calculated as: consensus length divided by reference length and then multiplied by 100

baverage coverage is the average of all the reads in each area in the consensus sequence

cnon-specific match read counts are those reads that can be matched more than one place in the reference genome and such reads were randomly placed in one of the matched spots

the is elements usually play a role in the genomic diversity among strains of mycobacteria  <cit>  and could act as a good target for molecular diagnostics  <cit> . similar to k- <dig>  the s <dig> genome has all the well-studied insertion sequences . is <dig> is generally considered a map specific element that was originally discovered in  <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig> copies of is <dig> were found in the s <dig> genome, which is identical to the k- <dig> strain. another element, is_map <dig>  is a map specific insertion sequence that was discovered by sequencing the k- <dig> genome. a total of  <dig> copies of is_map <dig> are present in both s <dig> and k- <dig>  likewise, is <dig> is present  <dig> times in each genome. no is elements were found to be unique to one or the other genome.

organization of the map s <dig> genome
sequence analysis alone was not sufficient to decipher the synteny of the genome. previously, we used an optical mapping protocol to confirm the organization of the map k- <dig> genome  <cit> . a similar strategy was used to analyze the genome of s <dig>  the raw optical map dataset comprised  <dig>  single molecule maps with a total mass of  <dig>  mb, and an average molecule size of  <dig>  kb . after assembly, the compiled optical map contained  <dig> single molecule optical maps , which covers the genome  <dig> ×. after a g + c content adjustment by a factor of  <dig> , the estimated size of map s <dig> optical map is  <dig>  mb, which is slightly higher than the sequence data suggested. however, if the estimated sequence gaps are added in, the estimated sizes are very similar.

to our surprise, there were  <dig> inversions that are larger than  <dig> kb when the s <dig> genome was compared to the sequenced genome of k- <dig> compiled by wynne  <cit> . the total size of these inversions spanned  <dig>  mb of the s <dig> genome. individual sizes of those inversions range from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb. as shown in figure 2b, homologous segments between map k- <dig> and s <dig> are represented by color boxes and to each segment a number was assigned. detail information of each segment is shown in table  <dig>  thirteen out of the  <dig> segments have at least one is element on the flanking regions .

similar to our analysis of inversions discovered in the k- <dig> strain, we used a pcr-based approach to examine two of the inversion breakpoints in the s <dig> genome , which are the right end of segment id # <dig> and the left end of segment id# <dig> . as expected, our pcr analysis confirmed the inversion predicted in the genome of k- <dig> and s <dig> strains. because these inversions were readily identified from the optical map and sequence alignment data, we did not attempt to confirm all of the inverted fragments by pcr. despite these inversions, there is strong synteny between these genomes, underscoring their close relatedness. both genomes share a number of large-scale clusters of homology where gene order is highly conserved .

genomic insertions
further comparative sequence analysis identified several regions that are present in map s <dig> and mah  <dig>  but not in map k- <dig> . the largest of these is a 9-kb gene cluster encompassing  <dig> orfs . this region was partially identified by representation difference analysis and termed pig-rda <dig> for pigmented strain representational difference analysis- <dig>  as detailed before  <cit> . it was also mapped to the mah  <dig> genome by dohmann and coworkers  <cit>  and was subsequently described by semret and coworkers as large sequence polymorphism , lspa4-ii  <cit> . this region contains a copy of the is <dig> insertion sequence and within the mah  <dig> genome is flanked by an additional copy of is <dig>  another previously described lsp included  <dig> orfs  and totals  <dig>  kb. this region was partially identified as the pig-rda <dig> sequence and was mapped to a  <dig> kb segment of the mah  <dig> genome  <cit> . the full sequence was later identified as lspa <dig>  <cit> , which is equivalent to mav island  <dig>  <cit> . an interesting feature of lspa <dig> is that it begins and ends with a transcriptional regulator. eight other lsps containing  <dig> or more orfs not present in k- <dig> were also observed . overall, a total of  <dig> orfs were present in map s <dig> but absent in the map k- <dig> genome .

lsp large sequence polymorphism as identified before  <cit> 

size is in kilobases

several new or only partially described lsps common to map s <dig> and mah  <dig> strains were also identified. a good example here is the novel lsp found in map sheep and mah  <dig> genomes is comprised of  <dig> orfs , predicted to encode proteins involved in the biosynthesis of glycopeptidolipids  <cit> . this region in map s <dig> revealed the presence of four additional orfs  with homology to glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis genes immediately downstream. the additional  <dig> orfs were also not present in the mah  <dig> sequence. finally, a putative transcriptional regular labeled as maps_ <dig> is present in map s <dig>  the protein encoded by this orf has homology to the gntr-family of transcriptional regulators, which are widely distributed across bacterial species and regulate a variety of cellular processes  <cit> .

genomic deletions
a second subset of sequence polymorphism was represented by  <dig> orfs that were present in the map k- <dig> genome but absent from the genome of map s <dig> . several of these deletions have already been described earlier. the deletion encompassing map1485c-map <dig> was previously identified by marsh and coworkers as s strain deletion # <dig> in an australian map sheep isolate  <cit>  and by semret and coworkers as lspa <dig>  <cit> . an additional larger deletion in the map s <dig> included the cluster of orfs between map1728c and map <dig>  this deletion was partially identified by marsh and coworkers as rda <dig>  <cit> , and later fully described as s deletion # <dig>  <cit> .

a novel deletion comprising the orfs map1432-map1438c  was identified in the current study as absent from map s <dig>  this deletion, termed sΔ- <dig>  was originally discovered by comparative genomic analysis and subsequently confirmed by pcr analysis. this gene cluster is predicted to encode four energy metabolism enzymes as well as a lipase . map <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein with homology to the rep13e <dig>  a family of repetitive elements that were originally described in m. tuberculosis and have been shown to be targets of phage integration  <cit> . there is a homolog to map <dig> that is present in s <dig> . the region around maps_ <dig> is not near the end of a contig and is nearly identical to an inverted stretch in k- <dig>  thus leading to the conclusion that maps_ <dig> is only a homolog of map <dig>  but that the gene itself is not present in the s <dig> genome.

interestingly, map <dig> was initially identified as absent via microarray analysis  <cit>  but sequencing of map s <dig> identified a homologue with 100% identity . likewise, map <dig> was identified as being absent from australian sheep isolates of map  <cit> . this orf was not identified as missing from map s <dig> as sequencing confirmed the presence of an orf  with 100% identity to map <dig>  these discrepancies may represent a geographic difference between map isolates recovered from sheep in australia and the united states or it may be an error from the microarray experiment. these were the only observed differences between the microarray and sequence data. overall, genomic alignments indicated the presence of a significant number of insertions and deletions between ovine and bovine strains of map that are suggested to be associated with their respective host.

evolutionary analysis of the map s <dig> genome
genomic insertions and deletions have been previously used to determine evolutionary relationships among mac strains  <cit> . with the genome sequence of these ovine isolates of map, we can now add comprehensive snp and inversion data to strengthen evolutionary hypotheses. earlier genotyping of the map s <dig> utilizing snp of recf, gyra and gyrb genes indicated that this strain belong to the map type iii, a sublineage of the map-s cluster of isolates  <cit> . to examine the evolutionary history of map, we analyzed the genome sequence of s <dig> compared to other clinical isolates circulating in sheep as well as the standard cattle strain, k- <dig>  our first level of analysis included the alignment of the s <dig> genome to that of the jtc <dig> and jtc <dig>  this alignment resulted in identical genome organization of all three ovine isolates, as expected. additionally, we examined the relationship among s <dig>  with both k- <dig>  and mah  <dig> . such analysis identified several events of inversions and potential insertions/deletions between genomes belonging to the ovine isolates and other isolates of bovine and human origins . the optical map of s <dig> confirmed these inversions as well. moreover, when the draft genome sequence of m. intracellulare was added to the comparison, the whole contig <dig>  aligns to the region spanning the right breakpoint  of mah  <dig> and map ovine strains, an indication of a conserved genome synteny among m. intracellulare, mah and map sheep strains, but distinct from map bovine strains.

in the second level of analysis on the nucleotide level, a core of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were present in both jtc isolates compared to s <dig>  in addition, a very small number of unique snps in jtc <dig>  and jtc <dig>  were not present in any other genome in this study. collectively, this small level of polymorphism indicates the clonal nature of ovine isolates, which contrasts sharply with the  <dig>  snps between the ovine s <dig> and the bovine k- <dig> strains . additionally, when analyzing genome-wide snps, it appears that map s <dig> and k- <dig> split off recently from the hominissuis progenitor strain . a similar result is obtained when snps are restricted to coding sequences .

discussion
comparative genomic hybridizations using dna microarrays have revealed large sequence polymorphisms  between map-s and map-c strains  <cit> . two large deletions of an australian sheep isolate were found by genomic hybridization to the map k- <dig> array  <cit> . one deletion encompassed  <dig> orfs  and a second deletion encompassed  <dig> orfs extending from map1728c to map <dig>  these deletions relative to the bovine strains were later observed in u.s. ovine map isolates  <cit> . construction of a map array containing mah sequences revealed lsps in the ovine strains that were missing in the bovine k- <dig> strain  <cit> . these documented differences formed the basis for whole-genome sequencing of a sheep isolate to enable comprehensive description of all genetic differences from map-s and map-c strains. we took advantage of next-generation sequencing technology combined with optical mapping  <cit>  to decipher the complete genome of map isolates from sheep flocks raised in the usa. our analysis confirmed earlier polymorphisms among map-s and map-c strains and revealed novel regions of difference. surprisingly, both genome sequencing and optical mapping showed remarkable differences between map-s and map-c strains despite the overall similarity in the clinical signs of johne's disease in sheep and cattle. recently, a study using a large number of map isolates provided an example of such a genomic polymorphism including  <dig> large regions of duplication, termed vgi- <dig>  and vgi- <dig> , observed in most map-c strains but not map-s isolates  <cit> . both of these duplications were also missing in our sequenced map-s genomes as determined by pcr amplification using outward facing primers reported by wynne et al. .

there are  <dig> genes present in all three ovine isolates that are absent from the k- <dig> strain, an indication for map adaptation to specific hosts . analysis of additional ovine and bovine isolates is needed to strengthen any linkage between these genes with host association. within this subset, we identified a surprising number of genes annotated as hypothetical proteins . six transcriptional regulators were also present among these genes with the remaining genes showing weak homology to sequences in the genbank database. we hypothesize that these genes could be responsible for the observed phenotypic differences between ovine and bovine strains and warrant future studies to address this hypothesis.

based on extensive genomic rearrangements between map bovine and ovine strains, we were able to provide a possible evolutionary scenario for members of the mac group. a genomic region spanning the inversion of map bovine strains, map ovine strains and mah  <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  to diverge into these three subspecies, the common ancestor appears to have undergone two independent genomic inversion events . specifically, it would take one inversion event to diverge between mah  <dig> and map sheep strains followed by a second inversion event between map sheep strains and the map cattle strain . therefore, assuming that one strain diverges into another strain by taking the shortest evolutionary path, it would be least likely that mah directly evolved from map cattle strains or vice versa. this strongly suggests that map sheep strains are the intermediate taxon of the three. data from behr and coworkers suggest mah  <dig> is the ancestor strain  <cit> . moreover, when the genome of m. intracellulare is added to the comparison, the genome synteny was conserved among m. intracellulare, mah and map sheep strains, but not in map cattle strains. thus, it is possible that the common ancestor of the mac must resemble either mah  <dig> or m. intracellulare, and map bovine strains are the latest diverged strains among them with map s <dig> as an intermediary strain . this model partially agrees with a hypothesis that suggests mah differentiated into two lineages, map ovine and bovine strains, by delineating chronological genomic insertion/deletion events without considering other genomic rearrangement events  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes in s <dig> that are absent in k- <dig>   <dig> are present in mah  <dig> and only  <dig> are absent from mah  <dig>  further genotyping of the s <dig> clustered this isolate with the group of map-s type iii  <cit> , a sub-lineage of the sheep strains. however, we prefer to maintain the map-s designation since the type iii genotype was based on  <dig> snps present in a subgroup of sheep isolates with no distinctive clinical or pathological features. finally, a recent study analyzing the sequence polymorphisms of is <dig> among the mac also supports the hypothesis that map ovine strains are the intermediary taxa between mah and map bovine strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
genome sequencing of map-s strains have revealed extensive genome inversions and previously characterized deletions when compared to the k- <dig> strain. furthermore, there appears to be a high degree of homology within us map-s strains as suggested by the remarkably low number of snps present in the three isolates sequenced. evolutionary analysis based on whole genome sequencing suggests mah is the progenitor strain, followed by map-s, followed by map-c strains.

overall, next-generation sequencing combined with optical mapping provided us with a high resolution tool to decipher the evolution of important pathogenic mycobacteria. comparative sequence analysis of the map isolates from sheep has improved our understanding of the evolutionary history of members of mac and provided the foundation for novel insights into the pathogenesis of this important pathogen. similar approaches can be used to examine other closely related pathogens.
