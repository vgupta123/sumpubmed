BACKGROUND
development of new functional genes is central to the evolution of species-specific traits  <cit> . two major mechanisms allow for creation of new genes based on existing templates: duplication of chromosomal regions containing gene loci and retrotransposition of mrna transcripts into the genome - a process which in mammals is facilitated by active line- <dig> retrotransposons   <cit> . novel functions for processed genes, termed retrogenes, may come from the acquirement of new spatio-temporal expression patterns, dictated by the genomic context of cdna insertion  <cit> . furthermore, functional evolution of their regulatory sequences and coding sequences, driven by natural selection, could result in new functions within signaling networks  <cit> .

evidence for the latter mode of gene evolution is scarce. first of all, expression of retrogenes has only recently begun to be explored. although expression of processed genes seems to be more common than previously anticipated, surveys are frequently limited to a single species  <cit> . in addition, the physiological consequences of altered gene expression patterns  <cit>  and/or the biochemical consequences of amino acid substitutions are rarely investigated  <cit> .

in the present study, we provide evidence for the functional evolution of retrogenes derived from the ras-like gtpase, rap <dig>  the activity of rap <dig> is dynamically controlled by many different receptor proteins, including tyrosine receptor kinases and g-protein coupled receptors  <cit> . these receptors regulate the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factors , resulting in gtp-binding of rap <dig>  or gtpase activating proteins  that strongly increase the hydrolyzing capacity of rap <dig> and thereby inactivate rap <dig>  <cit> . rap <dig> is involved in many different morphogenetic processes e.g. by affecting the activity of cell-matrix or cell-cell adhesion receptors. in addition, rap <dig> plays important physiological roles in established structures like for example the vertebrate blood vessel system. here, an acute rise in camp results in immediate enhancement of the level of gtp-bound rap <dig> that is crucial for an increase in vascular permeability  <cit> .

rap1a and rap1b are paralogs and differ only by  <dig> amino acids, that are mostly located at the very c-terminal part  <cit> . rap <dig> proteins are highly conserved in evolution and in fact identical rap1a as well as rap1b proteins are found in human, chimp, macaque, cow and mouse. while both proteins are ubiquitously expressed in tissues, a differential distribution of isoforms has been observed, e.g. rap1b protein is predominant in platelets  <cit> . possibly, the high level of sequence conservation and differential gene expression reflects specific functions for each of these gtpases. this would be consistent with the outcome of studies in mice with targeted disruption of rap <dig> genes. loss of rap1b impairs platelet aggregation due to a diminished activation of αiibβ <dig> integrins. in addition, defects in endothelial cells may cause bleedings, resulting in a high percentage of embryonic lethality  <cit> . rap1a knockout mice are fully viable and fertile, but haematopoietic cells from the spleen and thymus adhere less efficiently to fibronectin or collagen as compared to wild type cells  <cit> . in agreement with earlier in vitro observations  <cit> , a recent work reported a reduced superoxide production in rap1a -/- neutrophils  <cit> . double rap1a/rap1b knockout mice die during early embryogenesis suggesting functional overlap between the two rap <dig> isoforms  <cit> .

our current study suggests that additional complexity resides within the rap <dig> signaling network. we characterize here two murine-specific rap1a retrogenes and one human-specific rap1b retrogene that acquired limited substitutions in amino acids, including the residues g <dig> and a <dig> that were found to be mutated in oncogenic ras isoforms. by using computational and experimental approaches we collected evidence that the species-specific events of retrotransposition and mutation created new rap <dig> isoforms whose signaling capacity differs from that of their parental isoforms. we discuss potential roles for rap <dig> retrogenes in cell physiology.

RESULTS
identification of rap1a and rap1b retrogenes with limited mutations
we have recently generated a rap1a-deficient mouse strain  <cit> . unexpectedly, pcr on cdna derived from tissues of rap1a -/- mice with a 5' primer recognizing the targeted second exon sequence and a 3' primer located in the last exon yielded products, thus suggesting the existence of another mrna homologous to rap1a. indeed, we cloned two cdnas that showed high homology to mouse rap1a , yet encoded proteins with either a single or triple amino acid substitution as indicated in figure 1a and 1b. we named these genes mrap1a-retro <dig>  and mrap1a-retro <dig> . based on mutational and structural analysis of ras-like gtpases, it seemed likely that mrap1a-retro <dig> and mrap1a-retro <dig> would encode for activated  versions of rap1a.

remarkably, database searches did not identify any mouse ests corresponding to either of the mrap1a-retro transcripts. to establish that the cloned mrap1a-retro <dig> and mrap1a-retro <dig> were not derived from amplification of genomic dna, two control experiments were done. first, reverse transcriptase was left out of the rt-pcr reaction, which abolished amplification of the cdnas. secondly, the cdnas were amplified using the gene racer kit, which relies on removal of the cap from mrna and subsequent ligation of a pcr primer to the now available phosphate group at the 5' end of the mrna . the rna expression of both retrogenes was analysed in wt and rap1a -/- organs by rt-pcr. using pcr primers , which allow for simultaneous amplification of mrap1a-retro <dig>  -retro <dig> and mrap1a mrnas, a single pcr product of  <dig> bp comprising the complete coding sequence and a large part of 3'utr, was amplified . we identified a nlaiv restriction site unique for the mrap1a cdna and used it to distinguish between transcripts of mrap1a-retro <dig>  -retro <dig> and that of mrap1a. digestion of the  <dig> bp pcr fragment of mrap1a yielded two fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. by means of this approach we could detect expression of mrap1a-retro <dig> and mrap1a-retro <dig> in multiple tissues like thymus, lungs, testis and brain . importantly, when rt-pcr was done on rap1a -/- tissue with one primer placed in the deleted second exon  cdnas of both retrogenes were amplified . the same was observed, when primers specific for rap1a retrogenes were used  .

importantly, we previously pointed out that also in human there is evidence for expression of a rap1b retrogene , named hrap1b-retro  <cit> . more specifically, database searches revealed expression of this retrogene in ramos burkitt's lymphoma, neuroblastoma cell lines and placental tissue, while a study by gyan et al. detected expression in a bone marrow sample from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome   <cit> . as indicated above for rap1a retrogenes, also the hrap1b-retro may encode for a rap <dig> protein with elevated gtp content because of a mutation at position twelve , but no functional characterization of the encoded protein was so far undertaken.

genomic localization and origin of rap1a and rap1b retrogenes
blast searches with the mrap1a-retro <dig> cdna sequence against the mouse genome sequence  revealed that the gene is located on the antisense strand of the 14th intron of general transcription factor ii h, polypeptide  <dig>  gene on chromosome  <dig> . the mrap1a-retro <dig> cdna sequence mapped to a single exon - a typical feature of retrogenes. a sequence identical to that of mrap1a-retro <dig> was found on an rzpd cosmid  that overlapped with a celera contig, also derived from chromosome  <dig> and containing exons of gtf <dig> h <dig> , . . importantly, the gtf <dig> h <dig> sequences flanking mrap1a-retro <dig> were not identical to those flanking mrap1a-retro <dig> and appeared to represent a second copy of the gtf <dig> h <dig> gene. both gtf <dig> h <dig> genes appear to be transcriptionally active as is evident from two different cdnas having intact orfs and corresponding to gtf <dig> h1a, gtf <dig> h1b . importantly, mrap1a-retro <dig> and -retro <dig> retrogenes were not present in other mammalian genomes . likewise, the duplicated gtf <dig> h <dig> loci were only found in the mouse genome.

moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the group of the two rap1a retrogenes and the mouse rap1a gene form a monophyletic group in the tree with other mammalian rap1a genes . thus, rap1a retrogenes likely split off the mouse lineage. together, this strongly implies that an event of insertion of a rap1a retrogene into the 14th intron of gtf <dig> h <dig> was followed by a duplication event and that the both events date back to times after rodent speciation. after the duplication, both rap1a retrogenes diverged by non-synonymous mutations  in their orf regions .

we resolved the location of the hrap1b-retro retrogene to the region within the antisense strand of the 2nd intron of sv2c  on chromosome  <dig> . this rap1b retrogene was only identified in the human genome sequence , as revealed by genomic blast searches .

interestingly, hrap1b-retro's mrna sequence maps to  <dig> exons that are separated by an intron, which was created by l1-mediated insertion of the sva element into a preferred target site sequence   <cit>  present in human rap1b mrna . we could reconstruct the insertion site for the human rap1b retrogene based on the comparison with the chimp genome . the 2nd intron of sv2c gene in the chimp genome bears the insertion site 5'-tttt/a-3', typical of the site recognized by l1's endonuclease. presence of target site duplications  flanking rap1a and rap1b retrogenes provides further evidence for involvement of the line- <dig> retrotransposition machinery . phylogenetic analysis established that hrap1-retro and the rap1b in human and chimp form a monophyletic group . this implies that hrap1b-retro arose after divergence of macaca from the ancestor of chimp and human.

functional evolution scenario
could yang's codon evolution model provide evidence for the functionality of the retrogenes? if the retrogenes are functional, we expect that there are selective constraints on amino acid changing substitutions. as a consequence, the ratio ω of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates should be significantly smaller than one for the retrogenes. to check that, we analyzed multiple alignments of the rap1a and rap1b genes with orthologs in human, chimp, macaca, dog, cow, rat, and mouse. all computational analysis described below were performed by means of the codeml program of the paml software package   <cit> . codeml assumes a time-continuous markov process of codon evolution  <cit>  and ω-ratios were computed as maximum-likelihood-estimates that maximize the probability to observe the multiple alignment under the assumptions specified below as outcome of the markov process. we also computed standard deviations of the ω-ratios by means of codeml. the assumed stationary distribution of codons was set to the one that reflects the empirical nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions in the multiple alignment. further, since the gene tree did not fully resolve relations between the rap <dig> genes , we assumed that orthologs in the alignment have evolved along the branches of the established species phylogeny  <cit>  . because the mouse retrogenes are most similar to the mouse ortholog, as supported by the well-resolved parts of the gene tree , we assume the retrogenes split off the mouse lineage. for example, figure 4a shows the phylogenetic tree with orthologs of rap1a and the two retrogenes in mouse. the right hand part of the tree depicts the evolution of the two retrogenes in mouse that emerged by a retrotransposition and a duplication event. we assume the so called clades model , i.e. the codon evolution model where the mammalian orthologs have evolved in accordance to one ω-ratio ω <dig>  whereas the evolution of the retrogenes was governed by a different ω-ratio ω <dig>  the multiple alignment of rap1b genes and the respective human retrogene was modelled analogously under the clades-model. amino acid sequences of mammalian rap1a and rap1b proteins are highly conserved, which is reflected in the small ω1-values indicating strong negative selection on rap1a and rap1b genes. we find that, ω2-values are much larger than the ω1-values.

we tested whether it is appropriate to assume two different ω-ratios in the tree within the clades model by computing the likelihood under the simpler m0-model of codeml and performing a likelihood ratio test . the simpler m0-model, which assumes only one ω-ratio for the whole tree, is a special case of the clades model. because the m <dig> model is nested in the clades model, the likelihood under the clades model is by definition larger or equal than the likelihood under the m0-model for every alignment. the test statistic Δ of the lrt is two times the difference in log likelihoods, Δ =  <dig> ln l - ln l. the null assumption h <dig> of the lrt corresponds to the assumption that sequences in the multiple alignment had evolved according to the simpler m0-model. then, under the null assumption h <dig>  the expected distribution of Δ is a χ <dig> distribution with one degree of freedom. the lrt reveals for both alignments that the clades model with two ω-ratios performs significantly better than the m0-model of codeml, computed p-values were prap1a < 10- <dig> and prap1b =  <dig> .

the fact that ω-ratios are larger for retrogenes suggests that the selective pressure on the replacement of amino acids was relaxed during the evolution of the retrogenes. however, ω <dig> estimates are at least two standard deviations smaller than one for both, for the alignment of rap1a genes as well as for the alignment of rap1b genes. thus, synonymous substitutions, which are assumed to be neutral in yang's codon substitution model, occurred significantly more often than non-synonymous substitutions and we argue that the evolution of retrogenes was subject to moderate selective constraints.

interestingly, lynch et al.  <cit>  compared measures of ω in paralogous genes of several eukaryotic genomes. the authors demonstrated that ω systematically decreases in time and concluded that "early in their evolutionary history, duplicated genes tend to be under moderate selective constraints" where the range for ω lies between values of  <dig>  and  <dig> . we thus argue, that the values of ω <dig> =  <dig>  and ω <dig> =  <dig>  indicate that the evolution of mrap1a-retro <dig>  -retro <dig> genes and hrap1b-retro is constrained by a regime of at least "moderate selection".

the tree dendrogram of figure 4b shows the evolution of the two mouse rap1a retrogenes after a retrotransposition event and a subsequent duplication event. if we assume the expected number of neutral synonymous substitutions under the 2-clades codon evolution model  to be proportional to the elapse of time, then it can be speculated that the duplication event occurred only shortly after the retrotransposition event. moreover, we found evidence for a scenario according to which the mutations at codon  <dig> resulting in synonymous and non-synonymous  substitutions in mrap1a-retro <dig> and mrap1a-retro <dig>  respectively, were generated by deamination of methylated cpg .

we further employed structural analysis and functional assays to uncover evidence for the molecular basis of evolutionary pressure to conserve these genes.

structure-related functional analysis
in order to functionally characterize the rap <dig> retrogene encoded proteins, we first tested for their ability to bind guanine nucleotides. mrap1a-retro <dig> and hrap1b-retro contain mutations in 59th  and 12th  amino acid, respectively, that are involved in the control of interactions with the gtp ligand . since mutations at position  <dig> and  <dig> are transforming mutations in ras  <cit> , it is expected that human rap1b-retro and mouse mrap1a-retro <dig> are more gtp-bound than wild type rap <dig> 

cos- <dig> cells were transfected with ha-tagged versions of wild type rap1a, human rap1b-retro, mouse mrap1a-retro <dig>  mouse mrap1a-retro <dig> or rap1a-v <dig> and labeled with . ha-tagged proteins were isolated by immuno-precipitation and their gtp/gdp content was determined by thin layer chromatography . as we and others reported previously, the percentage of gtp bound to wild type rap1a is around twenty percent, while rap1a-v <dig> is highly gtp-bound  <cit> . indeed, more than ninety percent of human rap1b-retro and about forty percent of mrap1a-retro <dig> was gtp-bound. mrap1a-retro <dig> was also almost exclusively gtp-bound. the latter is most likely explained by the mutation in the t <dig> located in the switch i region corresponding to the general recognition motif in the effector domain . importantly, t <dig> is conserved in ras-like proteins  <cit> . inspection of the crystal structure of the complex between the rap1a and the ras-binding domain of c-raf <dig> shows that t <dig> helps in coordinating the gamma-phosphate of gtp and the attacking water molecule required for hydrolysis .

previously, it has been reported that v <dig> mutations in rap <dig> are still sensitive to rap1gap  <cit> .

gaps  are proteins that mediate negative regulation of ras-like gtpases by catalyzing the hydrolysis of gtp. co-transfection of rap1gap with any of the retrogenes caused a strong decrease in the gtp/gdp ratio. however, this decrease was clearly less pronounced for mrap1a-retro <dig>  underlining the importance of t <dig> for gtp hydrolysis but also its involvement in control of interactions with target proteins. it was shown that mutations in t <dig> residue perturb a dynamic behavior of the switch i region  <cit>  and this can affect interactions with effector proteins but also regulatory factors like gap which bind to this region  <cit> .

the result above indicates that the conformations of the proteins encoded by retrogenes resemble that of active gtp-bound rap <dig>  gtp-bound rap <dig> and rap1-v <dig> are known to strongly interact with the ras-binding domain  of ralgds  <cit> . therefore, we compared the binding of the retrogene-encoded isoforms to gst-rbd with that of rap1a-v <dig> using a pull down assay . the binding of hrap1b-retro and mrap1a-retro <dig> to ralgds rbd was comparable to that of rap1a-v <dig>  in contrast, mouse mrap1a-retro <dig> did not significantly bind to this rbd. as discussed above, this is most likely caused by the t <dig> m mutation in the effector domain region that mediates the interaction with the rbd .

one of the best-documented functions of rap <dig> is to enhance integrin-dependent adhesion to extra-cellular matrices  <cit> . we assayed the ability of retrogene isoforms to increase adhesion of hb <dig> cells .

normally, these cells remain in suspension when plated on fibronectin-coated surfaces, but when activated rap1a is introduced into these cells they adhere in a vla- <dig>  dependent manner. we electroporated expression vectors for the various rap <dig> isoforms into hb <dig> cells and the next day allowed them to adhere to fibronectin-coated dishes . both human rap1a-v <dig> and human rap1b-retro clearly increased adhesion . as reported previously, expression of the rbd of ralgds decreased adhesion by preventing endogenous rap <dig> effectors to interact with rap <dig>  strikingly, expression of mouse retrogenes did not affect adhesion positively or negatively. from this result we conclude that whereas human rap1b-retro has dominant-active properties in terms of regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion, the mouse retrogenes are inactive in this respect.

cell spreading is a second function of rap <dig>  which is independent of the control of integrin-mediated adhesion  <cit> . to test for this function, retrogenes were co-transfected with histon2b-gfp into a <dig> cells, grown on glass coverslips, followed by staining with the anti-ha antibody 12ca <dig> or phalloidin. first we confirmed that virtually all cells expressing gfp also co-expressed ha-tagged rap <dig> . next, we used the phalloidin staining to measure the surface area of gfp-positive cells. untransfected and empty vector-transfected cells mostly have a round morphology under these conditions. expression of ha-rap1v <dig>  ha-hrap1b-retro and ha-mrap1a-retro <dig> induced a clear increase in the fraction of spread cells . in contrast, ha-rap1a-retro <dig> did not significantly alter cell spreading.

together these results demonstrate that the proteins encoded by the three rap <dig> retrogenes differ in their biological activities.

discussion
reverse transcription of mrnas followed by insertion into the genome is an event, which in germ cells can yield additional copies of genes for future generations. in most cases they will develop into transcriptionally silent pseudogenes, which harbor mutations in their coding regions, preventing the production of functional proteins. however, if retrotransposition yields processed genes that have a distinct tempero-spatial expression pattern and/or have acquired neomorphic functions as a consequence of mutation, their presence may be advantageous to the organism and expression may be maintained  <cit> .

indeed, a number of reports have recently appeared, suggesting that expression of processed genes  might be more common than previously anticipated. for example, the dppa <dig> gene, which has been used as a marker for pluripotency, was found to have a number of related retrogenes, of which at least one was found to be expressed in adult tissues  <cit> . expressed retrogenes are not simple evolutionary relics, but can obtain essential functions as was shown for the utp14b protein. mutation of this autosomal gene results in juvenile spermatogonial depletion  <cit> .

in the course of analysis of our rap1a knockout mice, we isolated cdnas from various tissues, corresponding to two distinct rap1a retrogenes. the existence of rap1-like retrogenes appears not to be unique to mice. recently, we and others reported the existence of hrap1b-retro retrogene in human, whose expression might be linked to development of myelodysplastic syndromes and other types of leukemia  <cit> . genomic comparisons indicated that the rap1a and rap1b retrogenes are species-specific and that the rap1a retrogenes are paralogs. interestingly, the recently emerged rap <dig> retrogenes acquired limited amino acid-changing substitutions and our statistical analysis favors a scenario whereby they evolved under selective constraints on coding sequence. in this respect, hrap1b-retro  and mrap1a-retro <dig>  were of special interest since they had substitutions at positions  <dig> and  <dig> , which resembled those found in constitutively active oncogenic ras proteins. both retrogene-encoded isoforms had an increased gtp/gdp binding ratio and interacted strongly with the ras-binding domain of ralgds in pull-down assays. strikingly, only hrap1b-retro increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion, whereas mrap1a-retro <dig> was practically inactive in this assay. cell spreading on the other hand was increased upon over-expression of both hrap1b-retro and mrap1-retro <dig>  these results are reminiscent of those obtained with various rap <dig> mutants, generated via site directed mutagenesis  <cit> . in that study, rap1a g12v appeared to be more powerful in suppressing growth of tumorigenic ht <dig> cells than wild type rap <dig>  but its capacity to induce a flat revertant phenotype of in ras-transformed dt cells was not strongly increased. in contrast, a rap1a a59t mutant showed opposite characteristics with a mild effect on ht <dig> proliferation but a clearly enhanced effect in the flat revertant assay. together, these results indicate that the proteins encoded by the rap <dig> retrogenes have different biological activities, and uncouple cell adhesion and cell spreading, possibly by activating distinct  rap <dig> effectors. indeed, rap <dig> effectors have been described, which preferentially increase cell spreading like vav  <cit>  or both cell spreading and cell-matrix interaction like riam  <cit> . it will be interesting to see if the rap <dig> retrogene products indeed selectively interact with such effectors. the fact that rap <dig> retrogene encoded proteins are in a gtp-bound state suggest that retrogene expression would allow for activation of rap1-dependent processes in a stimulus-independent way. this phenomenon is well known in the case of ras, where somatic mutations result in oncogenic proteins, which stimulate the erk and pi-3k pathways in the absence of growth factors. likewise, expression of rap <dig> retrogenes may activate the above-mentioned effectors vav or riam or any of the other rap1-effectors that include diverse proteins like phospholipase cε or the scaffold protein af <dig> . the precise mode by which retrogene encoded rap <dig> isoforms interact with known rap <dig> effectors or perhaps additional proteins will determine the physiological consequences. these may include effects on cell adhesion, important for neural pathfinding and immune surveillance or cell-cell adhesion, contributing e.g. to vascular permeability.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data above strongly indicate that mouse mrap1a-retro <dig> and human hrap1b-retro retrogenes represent recent examples of functional evolution. however, it has to be taken into consideration that not all of the described retrogenes will be selectively maintained and neo-functionalized. indeed, we have not been able to detect a biological effect of mrap1a-retro <dig> over-expression. this may lend support for the scenario where mrap1a-retro <dig> is unlikely to escape non-functionalization.

although it is hard to rule out that the other two retrogenes are on their way to non-functionalization, the fact that mrap1a-retro <dig> solely stimulates cell spreading but not adhesion, points to a unique property of this isoform. in addition, the fact that it like hrap1b-retro encodes for constitutively active protein, indicates that it can function largely independently of gefs. although one could argue that our current study does not reveal truly novel functions to warrant the term neo-functionalization, future studies that should try to identify downstream effectors for e.g. mrap1a-retro <dig> should shed further light on this issue.

it is of note that the ras-like protein family contains at least two other members of retrogenic origin, a h-ras retrogene named eras, and a representative of rap subfamily, rap2b. interestingly, mouse and human eras, acquired mutations at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> that render constitutively active proteins  <cit> . eras is absent from genomes of fish and amphibians and appears to be exclusively present in mammalian genomes. its primary function was linked to its highly specific domain of expression in mouse es cells  <cit> , yet expression of eras was not detected in human es cells  <cit> . on the other hand, the rap2b retrogene, originally discovered in human platelets  <cit> , is vastly conserved in vertebrate genomes. by contrast, rap <dig> retrogenes are products of recent evolutionary events that created species-specific isoforms with differential signaling capacity. although their physiological significance remains to be established, the fact that all of them are gtp-loaded, yet have distinct signaling capacities, shows how limited amino acid substitutions may turn recently emerged retrogenes into functionally novel genetic entities.
