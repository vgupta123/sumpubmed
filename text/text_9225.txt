BACKGROUND
to date, the majority of experimental pain studies using quantitative sensory testing  methodology have relied on very short duration stimuli, which do not vary in intensity, but can be adjusted to different intensities per trial . other qst procedures that allow for prolonged exposures may have changes in stimulus intensity that are out of the control of the experimenter . pain intensity clamping using the response-dependent stimulation  methodology was recently introduced as a new psychophysical approach to assess pain sensitivity in human subjects using prolonged thermal stimulation  <cit> . redstim automatically adjusts stimulus intensity to maintain a desired pain rating set-point by continuously monitoring the subject’s real-time pain ratings. redstim allows the maintenance of sustained but tolerable pain levels by varying stimulus intensity, which permits long trials of continuous stimulation even in the most pain-sensitive subjects. redstim allows researchers to challenge the pain system with longer stimulation exposure times, testing slowly responding pain modulatory mechanisms. all redstim stimuli are administered with subjects blinded to stimulus parameters while avoiding direct subject-experimenter interactions. redstim also overcomes the drawback of administering a predetermined stimulus magnitude when the subject populations include individuals with vastly different pain sensitivities. the redstim paradigm significantly overcomes important confounds in human pain experimentation, which are currently unavoidable with conventional qst methods  <cit> .

during prolonged sequences of redstim, pain intensity ratings oscillate around the desired set-point with similar temperature oscillations  <cit> . previous work revealed that redstim oscillations during ascending and descending series of stimuli yielded highly significant bidirectional sensitization and desensitization trends in healthy individuals  <cit> . once the pain ratings exceed the set-point, the stimulator algorithm starts a descending stimulus series  which reveals a sensitizing trend . conversely, once the pain ratings go below the set-point, the algorithm starts an increasing stimulus series  revealing a desensitizing trend . in previous work we have used the sensitizing/desensitizing trend terminology because the pain ratings are trending in the opposite direction of the stimulus temperature. this is not to be confused with the definitions of sensitization and desensitization, as we have also shown that the average running temperature does not change across redstim trials, suggesting that individuals do not experience prolonged sensitization or desensitization  <cit> . although the exact mechanisms underlying these trend effects are not clear, previous work has shown that a desensitizing trend effect can be established robustly by a one-step decrease in thermal stimulation, termed offset analgesia  <cit> . additionally, expectation-mediated mechanisms, such as those involved in placebo and nocebo effects, may also contribute. thus, the patterns of these sensitizing and desensitizing trends likely reflect modulation of somatosensory input, which may provide novel insights into human pain mechanisms.

an important feature of an outcome measure, for both research and clinical purposes, is its reliable reproduction under the same conditions. a recent review points to the considerable variability in reliability estimates of currently used thermal qst measures with reliability coefficients ranging from fair to excellent  <cit> . to date, there are a limited number of studies using redstim methodology in healthy  <cit>  and diseased human subjects  <cit> , with no studies examining its psychometric properties including reliability. only when appropriate psychometric studies including reliability are conducted on a measure, can it be utilized as a behavioral marker to quantify therapeutic response to treatment  <cit> . redstim could be specifically useful in drug trials where subject blinding to changes in pain sensitivity are critical for the study’s internal validity. therefore, the present investigation was designed to examine the test-retest reliability of the redstim measures across three different days at two different pain rating set-points.

RESULTS
sixteen healthy individuals  ranging in age from  <dig> to  <dig> years of age  participated in three different sessions two days apart. as previously reported  <cit> , all subjects experienced temperature oscillations during redstim stimulation on all three days . across the three days, the average pain rating was not significantly different from the preset pain ratings of  <dig> and  <dig> out  <dig> . to assess the reliability of the redstim measures, several variables were extracted from the output during the 120-second maintenance phase of stimulation. results are presented by the individual variables obtained from the redstim output.figure  <dig> measures obtained from the redstim cycles.

discussion
this is the first study designed to assess the test-retest reliability of redstim tested at the thenar eminence of the palm over  <dig> seconds across three different days. the reliability coefficients were in the moderate to excellent range supporting its inter-session or test-retest repeatability. the only redstim measure that had “fair” test-retest reliability occurred when using the 20/ <dig> set-point. this may be due to floor effects . given the importance of assessing pain sensitivity in a controlled and unbiased fashion for therapeutic efficacy trials, as well as the ability to measure effects of prolonged painful stimulation on the nociceptive system, redstim has enormous potential for advancing the current state of clinical pain research and treatment. self-report visual analog scales have previously shown excellent psychometric properties including reliability  <cit> . quiton & greenspan  <cit>  also found that the variability of pain ratings in response to heat pain was stable within- and across- experimental sessions with the greatest variability at lower pain levels. however, previous studies have used conventional qst methodology without the ability to blind the participants, avoid direct subject-experimenter interactions and the inability to continuously adjust thermode temperature from the real-time evas ratings of the subjects like in this study’s redstim methodology. although it can be seen from figure  <dig> the large between-subject variability in the temperature oscillations, these oscillations appear to be stable across three days.

the painful stimulation obtained with redstim may better model clinical pain conditions where the pain experience remains at suprathreshold levels for extended periods of time. a stimulus that lasts for a few seconds may not reveal pain modulatory effects including sensitization and desensitization. traditional methods of assessing sensitization have used short series of brief thermal stimuli of constant magnitude while measuring pain intensity changes  <cit> . these methods do not provide insight into slowly responding pain modulatory mechanisms because the stimulation series is short in order to keep the pain ratings from escalating to intolerable levels. the mechanisms underlying redstim are not currently understood. our previous work with redstim also shows that even  <dig> minutes of very low pain may not be enough to address sensitization and desensitization  <cit> . future studies elucidating the underlying mechanisms involved in the redstim paradigm are needed including studies using higher temperature set-points and longer stimulation periods. however, the present study serves as a first step to address the reproducibility of this method in clinical and translational pain research.

there are several limitations in the present study that should be taken into consideration. first, the degree to which expectations impact the measures obtained from redstim is not known. continuous pain ratings require an increased focus on pain compared to conventional pain application, which may lead to a higher pain perception than unattented pain application. however, we provided standardized instructions to continuously rate sensation magnitude. therefore, the subjects were not intentionally biased toward the ascending or descending series of stimulation. future studies should be designed to examine whether sensitization and desensitization trends have common mechanisms with placebo and nocebo manipulations. second, the current findings are only relevant to heat stimuli and other stimuli modalities may yield different findings. third, the current study tested only mild to moderate pain intensity set-points, thus the stability of patterns at moderate to severe pain intensity set-points is not known. finally, the present study was carried out in healthy young participants. it will be important to examine the stability of the redstim paradigm in older individuals and those with clinical pain conditions where the chronic pain may vary considerably over time.

CONCLUSIONS
despite its limitations, our study supports the repeatability and stability of redstim measures, which has important implications for clinical pain research studies. the redstim paradigm may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying chronic pain, which often fluctuates at various intensity levels. unlike conventional methods, redstim blinds the subject regarding the pain intensity set-point, supporting the future use of redstim for assessing intervention efficacy. by maintaining the pain intensity at a constant level with the redstim paradigm, a potential decrease in pain sensitivity can be detected by an increase in thermode temperature  and not by the pain ratings alone. finally, the prolonged stimulation in redstim may provide a novel insight into human pain mechanisms while overcoming common shortcomings of conventional qst methods.
