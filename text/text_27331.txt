BACKGROUND
the different types of interactions among proteins are essential to various biological functions in a living cell. information about these interactions provides a basis to construct protein interaction networks and improves our understanding of the general principles of the functioning of biological systems  <cit> . recent years have seen the development of various experimental techniques for systematic protein-protein interaction  analysis  <cit> . at present, however, experimentally detected interactions represent only a small fraction of the real interaction network  <cit> . therefore, a number of computational approaches have been proposed to expedite the ppi detection process based on only experimental techniques  <cit> .

computational methods that depend on not only sequence information but also some prior knowledge of, for example, localization data  <cit> , structural data  <cit> , expression data  <cit>  or information on the interactions of orthologs  <cit>  cannot be applied on some essential proteins that are observed in most organisms  <cit> . to solve this problem, several sequence-based algorithms have been developed to detect potentially interacting protein pairs when no auxiliary information is available  <cit> .

this work presents a novel sequence-based method which involves a mechanism for identifying the protein surface to help ppi prediction. this method employs the conjoint triad feature  <cit>  for describing protein sequences and the relaxed variable kernel density estimator   <cit>  for classification. conjoint triads, which treat three continuous amino acids as a single unit, have been shown to be a useful set of features in predicting protein-protein interactions  <cit> . this work improves this feature set by focusing on conjoint triads at the protein surface. this improvement is based on the assumption that protein-protein interactions are more related to amino acids at the surface than those at the core. to maintain the advantage of depending on only sequence information, this method employs an accurate accessible surface area  predictor, recently proposed by the authors  <cit> , to determine the protein surface.

in this study, a collection of  <dig> ppis is used to evaluate the prediction performance with and without the proposed mechanism for identifying the protein surface. the experimental results show that the surface information promotes ppi prediction based on feature encoding with conjoint triads. furthermore, the quality of the predicted surface is analyzed using a number of protein structures collected from the protein data bank   <cit> . the experimental results demonstrate that the performance of ppi prediction achieved using the predicted surface is close to that achieved using the surface obtained from protein structures.

RESULTS
this section first describes the workflow of the proposed method. next, the measurements and datasets for performance evaluation are presented. the proposed method is evaluated and compared with another sequence-based ppi predictor. at the end of the section, the predicted surface is compared to those obtained from protein structures.

proposed ppi prediction scheme
measurements
determining whether two proteins have interactions is a binary classification problem. table  <dig> lists five measurements that are applied widely on evaluating binary classification problems. the accuracy is the most commonly used measurement, which represents an overall performance of a predictor. the f-measure is designed for problems where a class of instances attracts most attention, which is appropriate for ppi prediction  <cit> . the precision is the fraction of predicted interacting protein pairs that truly have interactions. the sensitivity is the fraction of interacting protein pairs correctly predicted to have interactions, while the specificity is the fraction of non-interacting protein pairs correctly predicted to have no interaction.

the definitions of the abbreviations used: tp is the number of interacting protein pairs correctly classified; fn is the number of interacting protein pairs incorrectly classified as non-interacting; tn is the number of non-interacting protein pairs correctly classified; and fn is the number of non-interacting protein pairs incorrectly classified as interacting.

datasets
a challenge in preparing protein-protein interaction datasets is the presence of some interactions that are observed in the laboratory experimentation but do not occur physiologically  <cit> . to ensure the quality of ppi data, an interaction should be consistent with other types of information  <cit> , such as metabolomic  <cit>  and gene-gene relationship data  <cit> . though these types of data are often incomplete in most organisms at present, the interaction network of transcription factors  of saccharomyces cerevisiae is an extensively studied system in which all of such information are currently available  <cit> . therefore, this study collects  <dig> interactions of  <dig> yeast tfs from several studies and databases  <cit>  to generate a ppi dataset, sc <dig>  in this dataset, the  <dig> interactions are used as positive instances, while other protein pairs created by coupling the  <dig> tfs are used as negative instances.

evaluation of ppi prediction
in the experiment, the sc <dig> dataset is randomly split into three subsets of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> interacting pairs. these subsets also contain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> non-interacting pairs obtained by arbitrarily sampling of the negative instances in the sc <dig> dataset. care is taken to ensure that different subsets will not share identical instances. in this experiment, the first subset is used as the training set to predict the other two subsets. the predicted results of the second subset are used for parameter selection, while the predicted results of the third subset indicate the prediction performance of a ppi predictor. therefore, an evaluation process is performed by first using the first subset to predict the second subset. then the parameters that maximize the f-measure are used to predict the third subset. since the procedure for generating these subsets involves randomness, the evaluation process is performed ten times to eliminate the evaluation bias in a single evaluation process.

parameter o restricts the minimum number of surface residues in a surface sequence segment.

as a result, the average acc., fm., prec., sens. and spec. of the developed method are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. all five measurements are superior to those delivered by the predictor without surface information. these results show that the proposed mechanism for identifying the protein surface helps to predict protein-protein interactions based on feature encoding with conjoint triads.

evaluation of predicted surface
as shown in figure  <dig>  the 'asa prediction' and 'surface identification' steps are the major differences between this work and others. to evaluate the added components, this subsection reports the experiment for answering two questions: a) how the predicted surface overlap with the surface obtained from protein structures and b) how the ppi prediction performs when using the predicted surface compared to those using the surface obtained from protein structures. the ten tfs from the sc <dig> dataset that have structures in pdb  are used to generate a smaller dataset. this dataset, called sc <dig>  includes  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative instances from the sc <dig> dataset. each pair of the sc <dig> dataset contains at least one of the ten tfs. in this experiment, a prediction is made by five-fold cross validation of the sc <dig> dataset, in which each fold includes  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative instances. the cross validation is performed ten times to eliminate the evaluation bias. the surface condition is set to consider surface segments that include at least three surface residues.

the equation of each measurement is identical to table  <dig>  while the definitions of the abbreviations used are different: tp is the number of residues within the structural surface and are correctly included in the predicted surface; fn is the number of residues within the structural surface but are incorrectly excluded from the predicted surface; tn is the number of residues outside the structural surface and are correctly excluded from the predicted surface; and fn is the number of residues outside the structural surface but are incorrectly included in the predicted surface.

the next analysis aims to elaborate how much does the difference between predicted and structural surface affect the results of ppi prediction. table  <dig> presents the performance of ppi prediction using the predicted and structural surface. though the predicted surface performs worse than the structural surface, the differences in all evaluation measures are less than the standard deviations of using the structural surface. these results reveal that the added components of this work can achieve comparable performance of dealing yeast tfs to that delivered using structure information.

asa values of predicted surface are obtained from the adopted asa predictor. asa values of structural surface are obtained using the dssp program.

in the end of this section, a protein pair from the collected  <dig> ppis of which both the proteins appear in the same complex structure in pdb is used to plot the overlap between the predicted surface and the interface. this complex  includes the two subunits  of the rna ploymerase ii, which is central to eukaryotic gene expression and has been studied extensively  <cit> . figure  <dig> presents the interface residues of med <dig>  and med <dig> . interface residues are defined as those that have at least one heavy atom within  <dig> Ã… distance of the interacting partner. this definition is similar to those used in many studies  <cit> .

for med <dig>  the present method successfully excludes  <dig>  from total  <dig> residues while preserving  <dig>  interface residues. as shown in figure  <dig>  most interface residues, specified in yellow, are included. however, for med <dig>  the proposed method misses  <dig>  interface residues in the predicted surface in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> reveals that the predicted surface misses the segment  of med <dig> that acts like an arm stretching to med <dig>  a comparison with the interface shown in figure  <dig> suggests that the present method may perform better at handling flatter interfaces. since protein subunits may interact and form relatively flat or twisted surfaces  <cit> , the good performance of the present method probably results from the fact that most of the collected s. cerevisiae tfs have relatively flat surfaces.

these results also reveal that the proposed mechanism for identifying the surfaces of proteins with relatively twisted surfaces must be improved.

CONCLUSIONS
an enormous gap exists between the number of protein structures and the huge number of protein sequences. hence, predicting protein functions directly from amino acid sequences remains one of the most important problems in life science. this work presents a computational approach for ppi prediction based on only sequence information. notably, a mechanism of extracting surface information is proposed to refine the feature vector for representing a protein sequence. this method is analyzed in terms of a) the performance in predicting ppis and b) the quality of the predicted surface. the experimental results show that the present method improves on the prediction performance of ppi with an f-measure of  <dig> %. furthermore, the predicted surface of yeast tfs is consistent with that obtained from structures, which encourages applying the present steps of surface identification in other biomedical problems that require similar information.
