BACKGROUND
avian reoviruses  are members of the genus orthoreovirus, which belongs to the reoviridae family  <cit> . arvs are non-enveloped viruses that contain  <dig> double-stranded rna genomic segments and several encoded proteins, including at least  <dig> structural proteins and  <dig> nonstructural proteins  <cit> . arvs cause many poultry diseases, including malabsorption syndrome, chronic respiratory disease and arthritis. in contrast to mammalian reoviruses, arvs cause massive fusion of host cells but are deficient in hemagglutination activity  <cit> . the pathogenesis of arv-induced apoptosis has been studied in arv-infected chicken tissues, including the intestine, tendon, liver, and bursa  <cit> . we previously reported that arv s <dig> induces apoptosis by modulating src, p <dig>  mitogen-activated protein kinase , and protein kinase c δ, and also elicits cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol  <cit> . arv s <dig> encodes nonstructural protein p <dig>  which mediates cell syncytium formation through the activation of the small gtpase, rhoa, and rac <dig> signaling  <cit> . autophagy is a basic bulk degradation mechanism that controls the recycling and clearance of intracellular constituents into double-membrane vesicles, and traffic of these vesicles to the lysosomes for continued cell survival  <cit> . formation of autophagosomes requires over  <dig> autophagy-related proteins, including microtubule associated protein  <dig> light-chain  <dig>  the unc53-like kinase <dig>  complex, and pi3ks  <cit> . autophagy is tightly regulated by several cellular signaling pathways, and the major negative regulator is the serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin ; however, the class iii pi3k/beclin- <dig> pathway positively regulates autophagy  <cit> . autophagy has been recognized as a stress response to enable eukaryotic organisms to survive during severe conditions, such as nutrient starvation, oxidative stress, chemicals and infection by intracellular pathogens  <cit> .

previous studies on intestinal epithelial cells, demonstrated that oncogenic ras increases rhoa activity and promotes the degradation of beclin- <dig>  leading to the subsequent inhibition of autophagy  <cit> .under nutrient deprivation conditions, the activation of rock <dig>  promotes autophagy by binding to and phosphorylating beclin- <dig> at threonine  <dig>  this threonine phosphorylation inhibits the rock <dig> activity and promotes the association of beclin- <dig> with bcl- <dig>  thus, rock <dig> is one of the upstream regulators of beclin-1-mediated autophagy and controls the homeostasis between autophagy and apoptosis  <cit> . arv s <dig> induces autophagy in both primary chicken embryonic fibroblast cells  and african green monkey kidney cells , and infection with this virus increases the number of double-membrane vesicles in these cells through the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway  <cit> . arv nonstructural protein p <dig> is an activator of autophagy and regulates the expression of beclin- <dig> and lc <dig>  <cit> . thus, arv s <dig> seems to modulate autophagy and apoptosis via specific host cell signaling mechanisms. we hypothesized the existence of a switch between the kinetic control of these two kinds of programmed cell death during the arv s <dig> replication cycle. autophagic cell death could occur in condition which without the involvement of apoptosis or necrosis  <cit> . additionally, apoptosis and autophagy can simultaneously occur or exert synergistic effects under the same stress conditions, whereas in certain situations autophagy triggered only when apoptosis is inhibited  <cit> . some studies have linked these two different types of programmed cell death; however, there exist intricate relationships between them, the significance and precise regulation are controversial  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis in arv s1133-infected cells. we aimed to determine whether a molecular association exists between autophagy and apoptosis, and to elucidate the relationship between these cell death modes.

RESULTS
kinetics of autophagy and apoptosis in arv s1133-infected df <dig> and vero cells
to identify the kinetic differences between autophagy and apoptosis, the autophagic and apoptotic cell percentages were first examined simultaneously in arv s1133-infected cultured cells. the percentages of mdc- and hoechst 33258-positive df <dig> cells infected with arv s <dig> were evaluated by direct counting. figure 1a shows the changes in the level of cell death during 42 hr of incubation. autophagic cell death appeared at  <dig> hpi, increased at 12– <dig> hpi, decreased at  <dig> hpi, and disappeared at  <dig> hpi. however, a large number of apoptotic cells emerged at  <dig> hpi and continued to accumulate until the end of the observation period. a similar cell death trend was observed in arv s1133-infected vero cells . at the molecular level, we analyzed the expression of microtubule-associated protein <dig> light chain  <dig>  and caspase- <dig>  lc3-i conversion to lc3-ii is a reliable marker of autophagosome formation  <cit> , and caspase- <dig> cleavage is a well-established apoptotic index. the fluorescent staining shown in figure 1c indicates the presence of autophagosomes and apoptotic nuclei. significant numbers of mdc-labeled fluorescent particles accumulated between  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi; however this level decreased at  <dig> hpi. apoptotic cells with condensed dna appeared at the middle to late stages of arv s <dig> infection; from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi. figure 2a and b show that lc <dig> conversion and induced expression of beclin- <dig> occurred in the early to middle infectious stages then disappeared gradually in both vero and df <dig> cells; whereas cleaved caspase- <dig> appeared in the middle of the infectious stage and continued to accumulate in the late stage.figure  <dig> arv s <dig> induces autophagy and subsequent apoptosis in cultured cells.  df <dig> cells infected with arv s <dig> at an moi of  <dig>   vero cells infected with arv s <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for 0–42 hr. at the indicated time points, cells were stained with monodansylcadaverine  or hoechst  <dig>  the percentage of positive cells was calculated for  <dig> independent fields at a magnification of 200×.  vero cells infected with arv s <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for 0–36 hr. in hoechst 33258-stained cells , arrows indicate apoptotic nuclei with condensed chromatin. in mdc stained cells, arrows indicate the autophagic vacuoles .



in addition, we investigated whether arv s <dig> affects the expression of beclin- <dig>  a protein that participates in the regulation of autophagy, by analyzing the transcription of the 5′-flanking regions, from nucleotides − <dig> to + <dig>  − <dig> to + <dig>  and − <dig> to + <dig>  of the beclin- <dig> gene. our results demonstrated that these 5′-flanking regions constructed with a luciferase reporter were regulated by arv s <dig>  upon arv s <dig> infection, the − <dig> to + <dig> regulatory region of the beclin- <dig> gene showed a higher luciferase activity than the − <dig> to + <dig> control region reporter, and the − <dig> to + <dig> region revealed a negligible luciferase response .

activation of rhoa signaling by arv s1133
we next investigated whether the autophagic pathway is regulated by small gtpase by analyzing the possible roles of rhoa signaling in arv s1133-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. our results showed that the levels of gtp-bound rhoa and phosphorylated rock <dig>  a downstream effector of rhoa, were significantly increased  <dig> hpi, and this continued until the end of the middle stage . to confirm the activation of rock <dig>  the elisa method was used to quantify the level of active rock. the results shown in figure 3b indicate that the arv s1133-elicited rock activity increased between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. additionally, the activity of rock was fully suppressed in the presence of rock inhibitor y- <dig>  which further confirmed that the rhoa/rock pathway was involved and was active as arv s1133-infected cells were undergoing autophagy.figure  <dig> arv s <dig> activates rhoa and rock <dig> vero cells infected with arv s <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for different time periods.  cell lysates reacted with gst-tagged rhotekin rho binding domain fusion protein. active gtp-bound rho was eluted and subsequent detection was performed by immunoblot analysis using anti-rhoa. equal amounts of total cell lysates were subjected to sds-page and the protein levels were detected using the indicated antibodies.  200 μg total cell lysates were added to the plates and incubated, and a detection antibody and substrate were then applied. the amount of phosphorylated substrate was measured at an absorbance of 450 nm. each experiment was performed three times, each in duplicate. the data are presented as the mean ± sd.



rhoa and rock <dig> are required for arv s1133-induced autophagy and subsequent apoptosis
dominant negative rhoa-t19n, inhibitors and sirna techniques were used to elucidate the relationships between previously identified molecules involved in arv s1133-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. the overexpression of dominant negative rhoa and the inhibition of rock by y- <dig> or rock <dig> sirna led to a remarkable reduction in mdc positive and lc3-gfp punctuate cells: importantly, pan-caspase inhibitor, z-vad-fmk, did not affect the percentage of autophagic cells. autophagy inhibitor beclin- <dig> sirna, 3-methyladenine , and bafilomycin a <dig> also reduced the number of cells undergoing autophagy .figure  <dig> rhoa and rock <dig> are essential for arv s1133-induced autophagy, apoptosis, and the conversion of autophagy to apoptosis.  vero cells transfected with rhoa-t19n and incubated for 24 hr, before being transfected with sirna for 72 hr, pre-treated with 5 μm y- <dig>  10 μm z-vad-fmk, 50 μm 3-ma and  <dig>  μm bafilomycin a <dig> at non-toxic concentrations for 4 hr, and then infected with arv s <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for an additional 18-hr incubation. autophagic vacuoles were stained with mdc, and the percentage of positive cells was calculated in  <dig> independent fields at a magnification of 200× . vero cells transfected with lc3-gfp, together with rhoa-t19n, and incubated for 24 hr, or transfected with sirna for 48 hr then transfected with lc3-gfp, or pretreated with inhibitor for 4 hr then transfected with lc3-gfp. 24 hr after lc3-gfp transfection, arv s <dig> was added for an additional 18-hr incubation period. gfp-positive cells containing more than  <dig> dots were counted as positive lc3-gfp cells. the percentage of positive cells was calculated in  <dig> independent fields at a magnification of 200× .  arv s <dig> infected cells at an moi of  <dig> with an incubation period of 36 hr with identical treatment timings to those described in . three apoptosis assays were performed. the left y-axis represents the percentage of hoechst  <dig> positive cells and the caspase- <dig> activity in relative light units . the right y-axis represents the od 405 nm values from an apoptotic elisa assay. all experiments were performed three times, each in duplicate. the data are presented as the mean ± sd.  punctate dots of gfp indicating autophagosomes are shown by the white arrows .



next, the apoptotic characteristics of the cells were analyzed by hoechst  <dig> staining, the caspase- <dig> activity was assessed by chemiluminescence elisa, and apoptotic dna was measured by elisa following inhibition of rhoa/rock <dig> signaling, inhibition of autophagy by beclin- <dig> sirna, and blocking of autophagosome formation by 3-ma and bafilomycin a <dig>  which is a known inhibitor of the late phase of autophagy. the results of these three experiments showed that the level of apoptosis was also inhibited when the autophagic process was blocked . figure 4c shows the lc3-gfp punctate pattern of arv s1133-infected vero cells in the presence of various inhibitors or sirna. the level of lc3-gfp dots significantly increased in arv s1133-infected cells ), as well as in cells in the presence of caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-vad-fmk ). upon inhibition of the rhoa/rock <dig> pathway, the lc3-gfp positive signals dramatically reduced ). inhibition of autophagy mediators by beclin- <dig> sirna, 3-ma, and bafilomycin a <dig>  and inhibition of the rhoa/rock <dig> pathway also significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells, as evidenced by hoechst  <dig> staining and the immunofluorescence assay using an antibody against cleaved caspase- <dig> . the efficiency of sirna inhibition and overexpression of dominant negative rhoa were demonstrated by western blotting analysis . taken together, these experiments clearly demonstrate that rhoa/rock <dig> signaling plays an important role in the processes of autophagy and apoptosis that occur in the early and late stages of arv s <dig> infection of cultured vero cells.figure  <dig> beclin- <dig> is essential for arv s1133-mediated apoptosis. caspase- <dig> and hoechst  <dig> stained cells that have undergone the treatment described in figure 4b and indicated in the left. apoptotic cells showing condensed and fragmented dna  and cleaved caspase- <dig> are indicated by arrows . merge image of identical field upon hoechst  <dig> and cleaved caspase- <dig> were shown.



functional interaction of rhoa, rock <dig> and beclin- <dig> upon arv s <dig> infection
to further understand the molecular mechanisms of arv s1133-induced autophagy and apoptosis, co-immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting analysis was utilized to detect the protein complex formation. cell lysates from arv s1133-infected cells with or without y- <dig> treatment were immunoprecipitated with anti-rock <dig>  or anti-beclin- <dig> , then subjected to western blotting analysis using the indicated various antibodies. rock <dig>  beclin- <dig> and rhoa formed a complex at 6– <dig> hpi, which corresponded to autophagy induction. in the presence of the rock <dig> inhibitor, y- <dig>  the protein complex was disrupted. thus, rock <dig> activity is essential for arv s1133-mediated functional interactions between rhoa, rock <dig> and beclin- <dig>  it is known that the antiapoptotic protein, bcl- <dig>  interacts with beclin- <dig> in non-stressed, resting cells and prevents autophagosome formation. the bcl-2-beclin- <dig> complex plays a potentially important role in the convergence of the cellular autophagic and apoptotic responses  <cit> . in non-stimulated vero cells, bcl- <dig> formed a complex with beclin- <dig> . 6 h after arv s <dig> infection, this complex was disrupted and beclin- <dig> was released, allowing it to participate in autophagy .figure  <dig> functional interaction between rhoa, rock and beclin- <dig> in arv s1133-infected cells . vero cells pretreated with dmso  or y- <dig>  for 4 hr then infected with arv s <dig> at an moi of  <dig> for various incubation periods. 500 μg soluble cell lysates were precleared and immunoprecipitated with ip antibodies as indicated. the immunocomplexes were purified by protein a beads and loaded onto an sds-page gel. the interacting proteins were detected using the western blotting technique.



discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that arv s <dig> caused autophagy and apoptosis in vero and df <dig> cells, which was accompanied by the activation of the beclin- <dig> promoter in the early to middle stages, and induction of caspase- <dig> expression in the middle to late stages of infection. inhibition of autophagy by beclin- <dig> knockdown or autophagy inhibitors reduced autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously. in addition, we showed that inhibition of apoptosis did not affect autophagy in arv-infected vero cells, and the rhoa/rock <dig> signaling pathway played an important role in the process of switching the cell from autophagy to apoptosis.

autophagy is a dynamic process by which infected host cells clear invading viruses. a previous study by chi and colleagues showed that inhibition of autophagy through knockdown of beclin- <dig> and lc <dig> significantly reduced arv replication  <cit> . this suggests that in the early stage of viral infection, the induction of autophagy may trigger host cells to avoid apoptotic cell death. in addition to participating in the regulation of autophagy, beclin- <dig> has been demonstrated to play important roles in tumor suppression, cell death and development. moreover, beclin- <dig> also interacts with vps <dig>  the class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  that mediates autophagy and endocytosis  <cit> . many studies have reported that several small gtpases are involved in, and regulate, the formation of autophagosomes  <cit>  and apoptotic morphological changes  <cit> . for example, several rab proteins have been found to be involved in different stages of autophagy  <cit> . in the current study, we showed the kinetics of autophagy and apoptosis in arv s1133-infected df <dig> and vero cells, which are in agreement with those found in previous studies  <cit> . we further identified that arv s <dig> infection induces autophagy and apoptosis sequentially. rock <dig> is an effector of rhoa-gtpase and can be activated by rhoa-gtp under certain conditions  <cit> . a recent study by gurkar and coworkers demonstrated that activated rock <dig> induced by stress increases the binding and phosphorylation of beclin- <dig>  <cit> . the results of our study indicated that the expression of rhoa-gtp is dramatically increased from  <dig> to 30 hr post-arv s <dig> infection, and the up-regulation of phosphorylated rock <dig> also showed a similar trend. thus, the results suggest that arv s <dig> activation of rhoa and its downstream effector rock <dig> are closely correlated with lc <dig> and beclin- <dig> activation, as well as with cells undergoing autophagy.

we also investigated whether the autophagy process is able to regulate apoptosis in vero cells after arv s <dig> infection. overexpression of dominant negative rhoa or inhibition of rock by a specific inhibitor or sirna, significantly reduced the number of autophagic cells; while, pre-treating cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor, z-vad-fmk, did not have an effect on the inhibition of autophagic activity. the expression of beclin- <dig> was downregulated with beclin- <dig> sirna, blocked autophagosome formation with 3-ma, and inhibited the late phase of autophagy with bafilomycin a <dig>  inhibition of beclin- <dig> dramatically reduced the level of apoptosis and the caspase- <dig> activity; suggesting that apoptosis was inhibited when the autophagic process was blocked . this phenomenon suggests that arv induces autophagy and apoptosis sequentially, confirming the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis proposed by previous researchers  <cit> . one of the unique aspects of our study was that multiple tools were used, from protein to cell level, to validate the autophagic and apoptotic processes. this helps to reduce bias when analyzing cell death markers after viral infection.

beclin- <dig> knockdown or autophagy inhibitor 3-ma and bafilomycin a <dig> treatment suppressed arv s1133-induced autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously, suggesting a switch in cell activity from autophagy to apoptosis.

this indicates that crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is present in arv s1133-infected cells. several recent studies have also shown that crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis may occur in cells infected with other viruses, such as the chikungunya virus  <cit> , enterovirus  <dig>  <cit> , and ectromelia virus  <cit> . although infection with different viruses may share some mechanisms, the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis is complex, as different signaling pathways are involved in these systems. for example, knockdown of autophagy genes caused enhanced apoptosis and increased viral propagation in vitro  <cit> . however, on enterovirus  <dig> infection, inhibition of autophagy leads to inhibit the apoptosis that is dependent on the autophagosome processing stage  <cit> .

our co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that rhoa, rock <dig>  and beclin- <dig> formed a complex at a time point coinciding with that of autophagy induction. taken together, these experiments clearly demonstrate that rhoa/rock <dig> signaling plays an important role in the processes of autophagy and apoptosis that occur in the early and late stages of arv s1133-infection of vero cells.

previous studies have begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which cells switch from autophagy to apoptosis. one key factor is bcl- <dig>  bcl- <dig> has been demonstrated to play a key role in the regulation of both apoptosis and autophagy, by binding to the pro-autophagic protein, beclin- <dig>  and pro-apoptotic proteins such as bax  <cit> . the translocation of bcl- <dig> from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria is an important event that regulates the switch between autophagy and apoptosis  <cit> . autophagy-regulating protein  <dig>  also participates in the switch from autophagy to apoptosis. in addition, to initiate autophagosome formation, atg <dig> was cleaved by calpain, a calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine protease. the cleaved atg <dig> fragment then translocates to mitochondria and binds to mitochondria-localized anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-xl, and subsequently induces apoptosis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that rhoa/rock <dig> signaling plays critical roles in the transition from autophagy to apoptosis induced by arv s <dig>  the findings indicate that the important signaling molecule, rhoa, and downstream rock <dig> could be linked to the autophagy observed during arv infection. arv infection causes economic losses and an effectively to control the disease is required. however, the mechanisms behind arv-induced cell death are still largely unknown. in the present study, the mechanisms involved in the arv-mediated switch between two different types of cell death were investigated for the first time. several critical molecules undergoing transcriptional, translational and post-translational modifications following arv infection were identified through molecular and cellular research approaches. whether these proposed mechanisms occur in chickens requires further study. thus, these molecules could be considered as valuable targets for new preventive or therapeutic drugs.
