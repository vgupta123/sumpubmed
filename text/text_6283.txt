BACKGROUND
potassium channels play fundamental roles in physiology by controlling the electrical activity of excitable cells  <cit> . the pore-forming subunit of k+ channels is formed by four identical or homologous domains symmetrically arranged around the pore axis. each domain contains a transmembrane outer helix, a membrane-diving p-loop, and a transmembrane inner helix. the p-loop comprises a pore helix, a selectivity-filter region with the potassium channel signature sequence tvgyg, and an extracellular linker to the inner helix. voltage-gated k+ channels  also contain large voltage-sensing domains linked to the n-termini of the outer helices. in the x-ray structures of bacterial k+ channels, kcsa  <cit>  and kirbac  <cit> , the cytoplasmic ends of the pore-lining inner helices converge to form a closed activation gate. kcsa co-crystallized with tetrabutylammonium  trapped in the closed pore shows the ligand's ammonium group near thr residues of the selectivity filter  <cit> . in the open channels, mthk  <cit> , kvap  <cit> , and kv <dig>   <cit> , the inner helices are kinked at a conserved gly residue and the diverging c-termini form a wide entrance to the inner vestibule. the wide-open pore region of p-loop channels is a target for various open-channel blockers  <cit> .

numerous naturally occurring and synthetic compounds block kv channels  <cit> . classical low molecular weight blockers such as hydrophobic cations tetraethylammonium and tba are non-selective drugs, which bind to various subtypes of k+ channels. low molecular weight blockers that selectively target kv channels have great potential as pharmaceuticals. one of such drugs is correolide, a nortriterpene alkaloid isolated from the costa rican tree spachea correa. correolide blocks channels of the kv <dig> family with higher affinity than other kv channels  <cit> . within the kv <dig> family, the fastest kinetics of correolide binding is observed for kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  channels  <cit> . correolide prevents the activation of t-cells by selectively blocking the open or c-type inactivated kv <dig>  channels  <cit> . correolide and its derivatives are candidates for the development of novel immunosuppressant drugs for the treatment of graft rejection and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . mapping of correolide receptor in kv <dig>  channel may help design these drugs.

mutational and ligand-binding studies predicted that dihydrocorreolide  binds in the central pore of kv <dig>   <cit> . earlier we have built the kvap-based model of the shaker channel, which explained cd2+-binding experiments  <cit>  and seemingly paradoxical observations that large correolide and small cd2+ ions block the open channel at the same level of the pore  <cit> . structure of kv <dig>   <cit>  confirmed major predictions of the model  <cit> , but demonstrated that the open pore of kv <dig>  is ~ <dig> Å narrower than that in kvap. the  <dig> Å-wide pore of kv <dig>  is consistent with the correolide dimensions predicted to be  <dig> –  <dig> Å  <cit> . a recent study shows that another semirigid bulky ligand, d-tubocurarine binds in the open pore of kv <dig>   <cit> . mapping of the correolide receptor in the kv <dig> -based model of kv <dig>  is now warranted to rationalize mutational studies  <cit>  and provide information for possible design of simpler drugs targeting kv <dig>  channels.

several theoretical and experimental studies predicted the involvement of metal ions in ligand-receptor interactions in ion channels  <cit> . however, no direct experimental data on the ternary complex formation is yet available. in this regard, the complex of kv <dig>  with correolide seems to be a promising object to further address this problem computationally. indeed, the large semirigid and nucleophilic ligand  should adopt a limited number of binding modes in the pore, while the x-ray structures of k+ channels show that the k+ ion bound to thr residues in the four tvgyg motifs  may be accessible from the cytoplasmic side by ligands. a metal ion in the focus of macrodipoles of the pore helices  also may interact with nucleophilic ligands  <cit> .

in this work, we have built kv <dig> -based models of the open kv <dig>  with potassium binding sites 2/ <dig> or 1/3/ <dig> loaded by k+ ions. the respective models are named 2/ <dig> and 1/3/ <dig>  we further searched for the energetically optimal positions and orientations of correolide in models 2/ <dig> and 1/3/ <dig> by launching monte carlo-energy minimization  trajectories from a large number of random starting points. to explore whether the bulky correolide can reach the selectivity filter from the cytoplasm, we also computed profiles of mc-minimized energy of the drug pulled through the inner pore of model 2/ <dig>  calculations predict that correolide can bind inside the pore in both models 2/ <dig> and 1/3/ <dig> and chelate a k+ ion in position  <dig> or  <dig>  respectively. in both 2/ <dig> and 1/3/ <dig> models, most of the experimentally detected correolide-sensing residues directly interact with the drug. a large contribution to the ligand binding energy provided by a potassium ion suggests that it is an indispensable part of the correolide receptor.

RESULTS
correolide structure
the semirigid molecule of correolide seen in the x-ray structure  <cit>  has the shape of a flattened ellipsoid with epoxide oxygen at one pole and carbonyl oxygen in the seven-membered ring at another. let us define the long axis of correolide as a line drawn between the poles, which are ~ <dig> Å apart. the length of correolide is ~ <dig> Å, which is defined as the distance between the most remote points at the van der waals surfaces of the opposite poles. the length significantly exceeds the width of the open pore, which is ~ <dig> Å in kv <dig> . this rules out the orientation of correolide with its long axis normal to the pore axis. the molecule contains an epoxide, ester, hydroxyl, acetyl, and five acetoxy groups with a total of  <dig> oxygen atoms. these groups can accept up to  <dig> h-bonds and donate only one h-bond. this makes correolide a nucleophilic molecule. however, the nucleophilic potential of the ligand is not matched by the inner vestibule of the channel, which is predominantly lined with hydrophobic residues in the inner helices. thr <dig> and thr <dig> in the pore helices could provide h-bond donors to few oxygen atoms at the poles of correolide but not to other oxygens. the lack of chemical complementarity between correolide and the inner vestibule rules out the application of ligand-receptor constraints to bias specific orientations of the drug. therefore, no constraints were used during the random search for the optimal binding modes of the ligand.

correolide in the kv <dig> -based model of the open kv <dig> 
the kv <dig> -based homology model of the pore domain of kv <dig>  contains outer helices, p-loops, and inner helices . the voltage-sensing domains were not modeled. to predict the energetically optimal binding modes of correolide inside the 2/ <dig> model of kv <dig> ,  <dig>  positions and orientations of the ligand were randomly generated within a cylinder of  <dig> ×  <dig> Å . from each starting point, the energy was minimized. a thousand of the lowest-energy conformations found at this stage were further mc-minimized. six structures within  <dig> kcal/mol from the apparent global minimum show that correolide can adopt various positions and orientations inside the pore . the random search did not predict any low-energy complexes with the ligand in the interface between domains. in the lowest-energy complexes found, correolide interacts with the k+ ion in position  <dig>  which is coordinated between the side chains and backbone oxygens of thr <dig> . energy characteristics of the representative complexes in which correolide chelates the k+ ion by either the ether group in the seven-membered ring or the epoxy group are given in table  <dig>  the complexes are stabilized by van der waals and electrostatic interactions, but do not contain intermolecular h-bonds. table  <dig> highlights nine inner-helix residues, whose mutations affect correolide binding  <cit> . seven of these residues provide contributions to the ligand-receptor energy ≥ | <dig> | kcal/mol . in addition, thr <dig> and thr <dig> at the selectivity filter also interact with the drug, but the threonines from different domains provide either favorable or unfavorable contributions, which counterbalance each other. in the optimal complexes, oxygen atoms at the poles of the ellipsoid-shaped correolide form direct contacts with the k+ ion in position  <dig>  which contributes up to - <dig>  kcal/mol to the ligand-receptor energy. several other oxygen atoms of correolide also contribute stabilizing electrostatic energy by interacting with k+ ions.

d three acetoxy groups .

e ile <dig> contributes to correolide binding in our models, but is not categorized as a correolide-sensing residue because its mutation results in poor expression of the channels  <cit> .

while docking correolide from many randomly generated starting points predicts energetically preferable binding modes, it does not allow concluding whether the binding site is reachable for correolide from the cytoplasm. indeed, a priori, we could not rule out that a large energy barrier may preclude access of the bulky correolide molecule to the selectivity-filter region of kv <dig> . to address this problem, we pulled the ligand through the pore in two different orientations: with either the epoxy group or the seven-membered ring oriented towards the selectivity filter. the translational trajectories were  <dig> Å long to ensure a thorough sampling of the space between the cytoplasmic entry to the pore and the selectivity filter. during this search, a flat-bottom atom-plane constraint was imposed on the k+ ion in position  <dig> to allow its penalty-free displacement up to  <dig> Å from the level defined in the x-ray structure. further displacements were restrained by the penalty of  <dig> kcal mol- <dig> Å - <dig>  figure 3a shows the correolide-channel energy, which was partitioned from the mc-minimized structures. as correolide moves inside the channel and makes an increasing number of favorable contacts, the ligand-receptor energy decreases . the energy reaches the minimum as the ligand binds to the k+ ion in position  <dig>  which is coordinated by residues thr <dig> in the selectivity filter. further advancement of correolide results in the energy increase due to repulsion from thr <dig>  the plots of ligand-receptor energy against correolide position in the pore do not show large energy barriers with both orientations of the drug  indicating that the binding site at the selectivity filter is reachable by correolide from the cytoplasm.

as correolide approaches a residue, the stabilizing contribution of the residue to the ligand-receptor energy increases . no inner-helix residue contributes positive energy to ligand-receptor interactions, indicating that unfavorable contacts, which are unavoidable in the starting conformations, have been relaxed in mc-minimizations. the plot of partitioned ligand-receptor energy  shows that k+ ion in position  <dig> contributes ~- <dig>  kcal/mol to ligand-receptor energy. this energy is weaker than the contribution of - <dig>  kcal/mol found during the random search. this is because the ligand, which is constrained to the plane normal to the pore axis at each point of the profile, cannot establish optimal interactions with the ion. as correolide approaches the selectivity filter, the total contribution of the k+ ion and the pore-facing correolide-sensing residues identified in mutational experiments  <cit>  is close to the entire ligand-receptor energy . leu <dig> and val <dig> stabilize correolide at the entry to the inner pore. interestingly, leu <dig> was detected as a correolide-sensing residue in mutational experiments  <cit> .

a metal ion in the focus of macrodipoles of the pore helices  was recently proposed to play a crucial role in the binding of benzocaine to sodium channels  <cit> . to explore a similar possibility in kv <dig> , we performed a random search of correolide binding modes in model 1/3/ <dig>  representative low-energy structures are shown in figure  <dig> and their energy characteristics are given in table  <dig>  since k+ ion in position  <dig> does not interact directly with the channel residues, a large part of its surface is available for chelation by the ligand. indeed, an interesting binding mode was found with three acetoxy groups chelating the k+ ion . in this mode, neither epoxy group nor seven-membered ring interacts with k+. such a binding mode may explain why elimination of the epoxy group and removal of the carbonyl oxygen from the seven-membered ring does not abolish the channel-blocking activity of correolide  <cit> . the same correolide-sensing residues that contribute to correolide binding in model 2/ <dig> also contribute to the ligand binding in model 1/3/ <dig> . the ligand-receptor energies in model 1/3/ <dig> are only  <dig> –  <dig> kcal/mol more preferable than in model 2/ <dig> . the small energy difference does not allow us to favor model 1/3/ <dig> over model 2/ <dig>  furthermore, we cannot rule out that both binding modes may coexist.

thus, our calculations predict several binding modes of correolide in kv <dig> . the population of these modes would depend on the pattern in which k+ binding sites are occupied by k+ ions and water molecules. when position  <dig> is occupied by k+, both the random and systematic mcm search predict the selectivity-filter region to be an important structural determinant of the correolide receptor . when position  <dig> is occupied by the k+ ion, correolide would readily bind it, providing up to three oxygens to the k+ coordination sphere .

sensitivity of results to the chosen computational methodology
the goals of this study were to predict the binding site for correolide and to explore whether the k+ ion could contribute to the correolide receptor. to perform the extensive search for the lowest-energy complexes between kv <dig>  and correolide, we used several approximations: rather small cutoff of  <dig> Å, implicit solvent, simple treatment of the electrostatic interactions, and neutral forms of ionizable residues. such approximations are hardly acceptable in computational studies aimed to predict the free energy of ligand binding or simulate ion permeation. however, results of the correolide receptor mapping are less critical to the method of energy calculation. indeed, in the best complexes, correolide appears to fit in the inner pore. the geometry of the tight ligand-channel complex is defined primarily by the van der waals energy, which is reliably predicted with different force fields. nevertheless, to assess the sensitivity of our results to variations in methodological setup, we reevaluated the geometry and energy of the correolide complex with model 2/ <dig> by submitting additional mcm trajectories starting from the optimal structure predicted in the random search . the additional mcm trajectories were run with a larger cutoff, ionized titrable residues, weaker electrostatics, and k+ ion removed from position  <dig> 

results show that the geometry of the mc-minimized structures remains practically unchanged under different methodological setups . among the different methodological settings that could potentially affect the ligand-receptor energy, only reduced electrostatic interactions weakened the ligand-receptor energy, which nevertheless remained preferable . the involvement of a k+ ion in correolide binding is the most important prediction, which is insensitive to the variations of methodology. indeed, correolide does not bring charged or ionizable groups to the selectivity filter, but just replaces one to three water molecules from the cytoplasmic face of a k+ ion at the pore axis.

a calculations were performed in the kv <dig> -based model 2/ <dig> with correolide bound with the epoxy group towards the selectivity filter. each value of the ligand-receptor energy was obtained in an mcm trajectory that started from the best structure found by the random search  and terminated when the last  <dig> energy minimizations did not decrease the energy of the apparent global minimum found.

b only deviations from the standard protocol are indicated.

discussion
various naturally occurring and synthetic compounds targeting kv channels have been characterized  <cit> . classical blockers of k+ channels such as tetraethylammonium and peptidyl toxins lack selectivity to different subtypes of k+ channels. small-molecule blockers selectively targeting specific kv channels are valuable tools for basic studies and have large potential as pharmaceuticals. shaker-type kv <dig>  channels that control membrane potential and calcium influx are important targets for drug discovery. correolide is the first small-molecule ligand isolated from a natural product, which blocks kv <dig>  channels in t cells. understanding the mechanism of correolide block could help develop other immunosuppressants as well as selective blockers of various kv channels.

little structural information is available on the complexes of small-molecule ligands with p-loop channels. the crystallographic structure of a ligand-bound kcsa  <cit>  shows tba trapped in the water-lake cavity with the center of the ammonium group being near to the focus of four macrodipoles of the pore helices. unlike tba, correolide is an electrically neutral ligand with numerous nucleophilic groups. mutational studies  <cit>  revealed correolide-sensing residues in the inner and outer helices of kv <dig> , but did not explain the causes of high-affinity binding of the drug. furthermore, all correolide-sensing residues revealed in study  <cit>  cannot bind simultaneously to the drug in any reasonable model of the ion channel. therefore, the three-dimensional mapping of the correolide receptor was one of the aims of our study.

correolide-sensing residues
hanner et al.  <cit>  revealed nine residues in the inner helices, whose mutation changes correolide binding energy by more than  <dig> kcal/mol . five of these residues face the inner pore  and provide noticeable energy to correolide binding in both 2/ <dig> and 1/3/ <dig> models of kv <dig>  . why the remaining four residues in the inner helices affect correolide binding in experiments but not in the model? one of these residues is ala <dig> whose substitution with cys affects correolide binding in mutational experiments  <cit> . however, ala <dig> does not contribute to correolide-binding energy . the cause may be that ala <dig> approaches val <dig> in the selectivity filter. the substitution of ala <dig> with a larger cys may affect the selectivity filter structure and interaction of correolide with a k+ ion at the selectivity filter. ogielska and aldrich  <cit>  found that the ala413cys mutation in kv <dig>  decreases the affinity for k+ ions, possibly due to conformational changes at the selectivity filter. in view of our model, these data support the notion that a k+ ion at the selectivity filter can stabilize correolide binding.

the mutation of pro <dig> in the pvp motif of the inner helix affects correolide binding, however pro <dig> does not provide noticeable contribution to the ligand-receptor energy in three ligand-binding modes characterized in table  <dig>  the substitution of pro <dig> could decrease the flexibility of the inner helix by enabling the backbone nh group in this position to form an h-bond with carbonyl oxygens in positions 419– <dig>  this may change the orientation of val <dig> and pro <dig> residues that affect correolide binding in both experiments and computational models .

according to our model, ile <dig> contributes to correolide binding . however, experimental data on the involvement of ile <dig> in correolide binding are not available. the mutation ile420ala results in the low expression of kv <dig>   <cit>  indicating that large hydrophobic ile <dig> is involved in the stabilization of the channel structure. such stabilization is more likely if the side chains of ile <dig> interact with other transmembrane helices rather than face the pore. indeed, in the kv <dig> -based model, ile <dig> is exposed to the inter-segment interface .

possible involvement of k+ in correolide binding
several models of ca2+ and na+ channels with the pore-bound nucleophilic ligands suggest that the permeable metal ions may contribute to ligand-receptor complexes  <cit> . recent experiments addressing the mechanism of action of batrachotoxin in the nav <dig>  channel  <cit>  confirmed important predictions of the ternary-complex model. however, the direct experimental validation of the ternary-complex concept is still difficult. the major problems are the uncertain location of the metal ions, relatively low stability of their complexes with the channels, conformational flexibility of drugs, and unknown location of their binding sites. correolide seems to be an appropriate ligand to investigate the possibility of its ternary association with the receptor and k+ ion because of four reasons. first, the drug has a semirigid conformation that would not change significantly upon the binding to the channel and/or to the ion. second, the size of correolide is compatible with the size of the open pore  <cit> , thus decreasing the uncertainty of the binding-site location. third, correolide has an ellipsoidal shape with an epoxy group at one pole and ester group at another pole . these groups can accept but not donate h-bonds and they can interact with metal ions. the nucleophilic character of correolide and the predominantly hydrophobic character of the inner helices in kv <dig>  suggest that a k+ ion in position  <dig> or  <dig> may provide an electrostatic component for the drug-receptor energy. fourth, approximate locations of k+ ions in potassium channels are known from experiments. importantly, in this study multiple positions and orientations of correolide in the channel were intensively sampled to avoid any bias on the ternary association of the drug with the channel and k+. the results suggest that the ternary complexes can explain peculiarities of correolide structure, results of mutational analysis of correolide binding, as well as coupling of correolide- and k+ binding sites  <cit> .

possible role of c-type inactivation in correolide binding
correolide binds to kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  channels with a higher affinity than to other channels of the kv <dig> family  <cit> . since the inner and outer helices are conserved in kv <dig> channels, correolide-sensing residues in these helices are unlikely to determine correolide selectivity to kv <dig>  and kv <dig> . what distinguishes the latter channels is c-type inactivation, which is less pronounced in other members of the kv <dig> family. how could c-type inactivation enhance correolide binding? a recent study suggested that c-type inactivation might be caused by the rearrangement of the selectivity filter in a way that the k+ in position  <dig> remains the only cation in the selectivity-filter region  <cit> . our models 2/ <dig> and 1/3/ <dig> predict the strong involvement of a k+ ion in correolide binding. in c-type inactivated channels, a deficiency of k+ ions in positions  <dig> –  <dig> would stabilize the k+-bound correolide. some analogy may be found in a ligand containing an ionizable amino group. when a proton binds to the group, the proton-ligand complex is considered as a protonated ligand, even when the proton is shared with a nucleophilic group of the receptor. similarly, when a ligand binds k+, the complex may be considered as a k+-containing ligand that would bind stronger to the channels, in which potassium-binding sites  <dig> –  <dig> are not occupied by k+ ions. this can explain the intriguing observations that the c-type inactivation enhances binding of both cationic and nucleophilic ligands in the inner pore of k+ channels.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we predicted the ternary complex between k+, correolide, and k+ channel and suggested a mechanism by which c-type inactivation could enhance correolide binding. the analysis of structure-activity relationships of open-channel blockers of k+ channels shows that many blockers have nucleophilic groups whose role seems unclear given the rather hydrophobic structure of the open pore. our study suggests that such groups can bind to the channel-bound k+ ions, which may be important determinants of corresponding receptors.
