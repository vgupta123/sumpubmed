BACKGROUND
vascular endothelial growth factor a  is a critical pro-angiogenic factor secreted as numerous splice isoforms that together regulate the phenotype and efficacy of growing vascular networks  <cit> . while the specific mechanism of this control is not fully understood, both isoform-specific receptor binding at the endothelial cell surface  <cit>  and differences in the isoforms' spatial patterning  <cit>  are thought to be key. we have previously published studies of the impact of isoform-specific receptor binding  <cit> , and here we focus on the spatial patterning. the spatial distribution of vegf isoforms is thought to be mediated by their interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans  in the extracellular matrix , and by proteases such as the matrix metalloproteinases , which can cleave both vegf  <cit>  and the ecm  <cit> . proteases have been shown to have important roles in inducing vegf-mediated angiogenesis and tumorigenesis  <cit> . while it may seem intuitive that ecm binding regulates vegf diffusion, computational studies suggest that at steady state, simple sequestration by hspgs may have little effect on the soluble vegf distribution. the specific mechanisms by which hspg binding and proteolytic release regulate vegf diffusion in vivo are therefore not yet fully understood, and we explore this here.

in mice, vegf is primarily secreted as vegf <dig>  vegf <dig>  and vegf <dig>   <cit> ; longer isoforms include c-terminal motifs that increase binding to heparin and hspgs in the ecm  <cit> . this increased matrix affinity can reduce the effective diffusivity of the isoform, altering the spatial gradient. for example, transgenic mice expressing only vegf <dig>  an isoform lacking hspg affinity  <cit> , show a shallow vegf gradient in the developing hindbrain  <cit>  and retina  <cit> , whereas wildtype mice, which predominantly express the heparin-binding vegf <dig>  have a vegf spatial distribution that is markedly more localized . systems secreting vegf <dig> show the greatest levels of ecm and basement membrane vegf deposition  <cit> .

as noted above, vegf sensed by endothelial vegf receptors has two isoform-specific components: the spatial differences between vegf isoforms; and the isoform specificity of binding to the receptors themselves as discussed below. these give rise to a spectrum of isoform-dependent vascular phenotypes . vegf regulates sprouting angiogenesis at the level of tip cell filopodial guidance and migration and stalk cell proliferation  <cit> . systems  secreting only the diffusible vegf <dig> usually develop wide, tortuous, malformed vessels with infrequent branching   <cit> . this phenotype suggests excessive proliferation and an insufficiency in sprout guidance. on the other hand, vegf <dig> alone gives rise to vessels that are thin and numerous and have high branching density  <cit> . vegf <dig>  similar to wild type mice, displays intermediate behaviour  <cit> . while these behaviours are thought to be primarily dependent upon the receptor tyrosine kinases vegfr <dig>   <cit> , vegfr <dig>  also seems to play an important but not yet fully understood role, in part by modulating vegfr <dig> signaling  <cit> . vegf isoforms also differentially bind to neuropilin- <dig> and - <dig> , a class of semaphorin coreceptors that function as coreceptors for vegfr <dig>  neuropilin- <dig>  for example, can greatly enhance the signaling of vegf <dig> relative to vegf <dig>  <cit> .

proteolytic release of vegf from the matrix seems to biologically mimic secretion of shorter isoforms . for example, vegf <dig> elicits vascular effects at greater distances away from the source of secretion than vegf <dig>  <cit> ; similarly, vegf release by the protease mmp <dig> enhances vegfr <dig> binding in quiescent vasculature by increasing soluble  vegf levels  <cit> , activating tumorigenesis through the angiogenic switch  <cit> . tumor xenografts expressing only the cleaved isoform vegf <dig> have large dilated vessels  <cit> . inhibiting mmp <dig> results in markedly localized vegf distributions reminiscent of vegf <dig> or vegf <dig>  with higher levels of matrix-bound vegf  <cit> . secretion of a synthetic vegf <dig> that is resistant to proteolysis  induces vascular patterning phenotypes similar to that of vegf <dig> alone, specifically high vascular densities  <cit>  . while the direct cleavage of vegf's c-terminal heparin-binding and nrp1-binding domain is the most accepted mechanism of release , cleavage of hspgs and ecm by proteases or heparinases is also a potent release mechanism  <cit> , but one that liberates intact vegf. recently, degradation of soluble vegf inhibitors such as connective tissue growth factor and soluble vegfr <dig>  has also been suggested to regulate vegf  <cit> .

the effects of protease-mediated vegf release are not fully understood. vegf164Δ108-118- and vegf188-expressing tumors show similar intratumoral vessel architectures; however, paradoxically, their ability to enhance tumor growth are vastly different: vegf <dig> either significantly delays tumor growth  <cit>  or cannot support it at all  <cit> , while vegf164Δ108- <dig> results in tumor hyperproliferation  <cit> . similarly, while most studies implicate mmps, e.g. mmp <dig>  in pro-angiogenic and carcinogenic behaviors through vegf  <cit> , in others, vegf proteolysis results in an angiogenic response that is uncoordinated and ineffective  <cit> , leading to lower vessel density and decreased tumor growth  <cit> .

it is not fully understood how the spatial patterning of different vegf isoforms and the processing of vegf by proteases control endothelial behavior, however several possibilities have been suggested by experiments  <cit> . for example, increased matrix-bound vegf in tissues  may increase branching behavior and decrease vessel diameters by increasing p38/mapk signaling  <cit> . alternatively, low levels of soluble vegf may independently increase sprouting behavior  <cit> . on the other hand, vascular patterning might arise due to neuropilin-1-dependent activation of p38/mapk signaling  <cit> , supported by the high affinity of vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> for nrp <dig>  <cit> . finally, steep vegf isoform gradients may improve tip cell filopodial stability while mitigating stalk cell proliferation  <cit> .

whatever the dominant signaling modality that guides vascular patterning, it appears from experimental data to have two particular properties. first, the seemingly monotonic increase in vascular density and decrease in vessel diameter with vegf isoform length  suggests that the critical feature of the vegf distribution that controls vascular behavior also varies in a monotonic fashion. monotonicity is also evident in the similar vascular phenotypes arising from mice dually expressing vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  and those only expressing vegf <dig>  at the same total rate  <cit> . second, increased vegf cleavage has the opposite effect to increased hspg binding  <cit>  . all of the above modalities seem to support both conditions; for example, among the isoforms, vegf <dig> would be expected to have the highest levels of matrix-bound vegf  <cit> , lowest levels of soluble vegf  <cit> , most directional gradients  <cit> , and possibly greatest nrp <dig> affinity  <cit> . similarly, vegf cleavage prevents vegf binding to hspgs and nrp <dig>  <cit> , and by solubilizing vegf should lead to greater diffusion.

to separate out the above effects, we seek to develop a precise understanding of the effects of hspg binding and vegf proteolysis on the vegf distribution by creating a computational model. the model should replicate key experimental observations regarding the vegf distribution : longer isoforms with stronger heparin binding affinity have higher degrees of localization    <cit> ; increased heparin binding affinity results in greater levels of matrix deposition and decreased levels of soluble-phase vegf  <cit> ; and vegf-cleaving proteases should reverse these patterns  <cit> . the inverse relationship between soluble and matrix-bound vegf gives rise to the question of whether total vegf is conserved in vivo. while this is expected in vitro  <cit> , and was also seen by certain studies in vivo  <cit> , other studies found significantly higher total vegf levels for vegf165-expressing systems  <cit> .

note the concordance of the outcomes of decreased isoform length and vegf cleavage.

* hypothesized, or some supporting evidence, but no definitive experimental confirmation

the current study extends our work on understanding the nature of vegf transport in angiogenesis  <cit> . among the numerous mechanisms of proteases modulating vegf, we focus on vegf cleavage, which we have previously studied  <cit> . our model describes a sprout situated in a vegf concentration gradient, to represent a range of biological systems, e.g. the hypoxic front of the hindbrain, tumor, or retina.

we use the computational model  to understand mechanisms that might allow isoform-dependent vegf localization and proteolytic redistribution to arise. using a vegf-vegfr kinetic binding model, we investigate how vegf signals may be detected by endothelial cells, e.g. soluble or matrix-bound vegf, and the impact of nrp <dig>  the results suggest that the system must exhibit isoform specificity in vegf clearance or degradation: along with longer isoforms binding to the ecm with greater affinity, the longer isoforms must also be cleared or degraded from the soluble fraction at faster rates.

methods
model formulation
to study the role of different isoforms and vegf proteolysis on the vegf distribution, we constructed a 3d reaction-diffusion-based computational model of vegf transport. the model is centered on a capillary sprout containing a single endothelial tip cell followed by stalk cells , to study the vegf concentration profile and gradients in the vicinity of the sprout, and to understand the receptor signaling and gradients detected by vegf receptors  on the endothelial tip cell. to dissect the behavior of individual isoforms, we consider separate systems expressing a single isoform in isolation, similar to those tested experimentally in developmental and tumor models.

a schematic of the vegf transport and reaction is presented in figure 2b. in our model, we label our vegf using the human isoforms nomenclature and represent cleaved vegf by vegf <dig>  which is the predicted mmp-cleavage product of human vegf  <cit> . while figure  <dig> primarily details the interactions of secreted vegf <dig>  we also separately consider vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  and hypothetical isoforms of intermediate lengths and properties. these intermediate isoforms are generated by smoothly varying the relevant parameters: hspg affinity, nrp <dig> affinity, and ability to bind the vegfr1-nrp <dig> complex. while vegf <dig> has weak affinity to nrp <dig>  <cit> , we assume it does not bind nrp <dig>  and this does not change our results  <cit> . intact  vegf <dig> may be unable to bind vegfr <dig>  <cit> , but binding of long isoforms of vegf to vegfr <dig> is predicted to be low in our model due to degradation and cleavage; cleaved vegf represents the majority of vegfr <dig> binding in this case.

we assume that vegf is secreted from the leading face of the cylindrical domain and is cleared by two mechanisms: internalization by the sprout's vegf receptors; and clearance at the trailing edge of the domain . as a base model , we consider that the sprout expresses all three vegf receptors, in a combination where excess nrp <dig> plays a potentiating role for vegf <dig> binding to vegfr <dig>  <cit> . the sprout is situated in a cylindrical domain consisting of an acellular extracellular matrix  that contains uniform hspg binding sites for vegf. for vegf proteolysis, we assume a uniform, single-step irreversible first-order mmp-mediated cleavage of vegf to vegf <dig> . the dynamics of protease activation and inhibition have been studied in the past  <cit> , but are neglected here because of uncertainties in the transport of the protease itself.

we have previously shown that the thin basement membrane layer does not significantly affect vegf diffusion near the sprout  <cit> , and thus do not consider the basement membrane here. as in previous models  <cit> , receptors are considered pre-dimerized and binding of the ligand is a reversible single-step reaction; in addition, internalization and receptor insertion are balanced to keep plasma membrane receptor levels constant. finally, though matrix-bound vegf may be relevant to vegfr <dig> activation  <cit> , our model only considers receptors binding to soluble vegf.

we study several specific models with increasing complexity, to understand the mechanisms behind gradient formation. the model components as described above - diffusion, receptor binding, proteolytic processing - comprise the "hspg-binding-only" model. this is so named to contrast with other models that add additional processes relevant to vegf patterning in vivo: patterned hspg gradients  and vegf degradation. vegf degradation is defined here as any interstitial process that destroys vegf activity, without generating an active cleavage fragment as proteolysis does. as with proteolysis, degradation was characterized by a first-order rate constant, kdeg. the study of degradation was done with two models: one assuming that degradation affects only soluble vegf ; and one in which both soluble and matrix-bound vegf are degraded . we will see later that the soluble vegf degradation model, in which hspg-bound vegf is protected from degradation, is effectively isoform-independent degradation; while degradation of hspg-bound vegf results in isoform-dependent degradation. longer isoforms have higher degradation  due to longer retention times.

in studying receptor binding, we incorporate a sprout expressing vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and nrp <dig>  this sprout can itself influence vegf transport , and to study the patterning of vegf that would arise only by diffusion, matrix binding, proteolysis and degradation, we also considered a variant of the model that contains no sprout.

vegf/protease transport and reactions
vegf biochemical reactions and transport processes are described by partial differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions. the computational domain consists of two components: the interstitium, into which vegf is secreted, and a sprout surface layer, on which vegf capture by the receptors is modeled. upon secretion from the leading edge of the domain , vegf transport within the domain is governed by the mass balance :   

here  describes the volumetric "bulk" concentration of the soluble fraction of vegf <dig>  assuming an isotropic porous matrix with available volume fraction kecm. d <dig> is the effective diffusion coefficient for vegf <dig> in the matrix;  is the density of vegf-binding sites, with reaction rate constants, konv,h and koffv,h. kp describes first-order net rate of proteolysis, and kdeg describes first-order degradation of soluble vegf. we assume that kp and kdeg are spatially uniform. the values of these parameters are given in table  <dig> and described further below.

cleaved vegf  is generated from the proteolysis of free vegf or matrix-bound vegf .   

vegf proteolysis also produces an hspg-binding c-terminal fragment  <cit>  that maintains heparin affinity, but we do not include it explicitly as hspgs are not saturated . the matrix components, hspg and vegf-hspg do not diffuse:      

boundary conditions for vegf reaction at the cell surface
vegf and cleaved vegf are coupled to the cell-surface vegf receptor population through the specification of boundary conditions. these boundary conditions equate the flux of vegf perpendicular to the cell surface, j = -d·∂v/∂n, with the rate of reaction at the cell surface. for vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  these reactions include binding to vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and nrp <dig>  while for vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  binding occurs to vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and the vegfr1-nrp <dig> complex .      

equations describing the vegf receptors are given as a system of ordinary differential equations over the sprout surface. in addition to describing vegf binding to the receptors, they describe the continual balance between secretion of unligated vegf receptors  and internalization , vegf <dig> bridging of vegfr <dig> and nrp <dig>  vegfr1/nrp <dig> coupling  and uncoupling , and vegf <dig> binding to the vegfr1-nrp <dig> complex. note that vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> terms are omitted for clarity. we assume that receptors do not diffuse along the cell surface.                                 

external boundary conditions for vegf secretion and clearance
the computational domain is assumed to be representative of its surrounding tissue in the radial direction. thus, we use a no-flux condition, ∂v/∂r =  <dig> at r = redge. the vegf gradient was specified by secretion of uncleaved vegf at z = +l using the neumann bc, -dv·∂/∂z = -q, and a first-order vegf clearance at z = -l, -dv·∂/∂z = -kclear. the secretion rate q and kclear were pre-calculated to generate the desired vegf distribution in the absence of proteases, i.e. a concentration v <dig> at z =  <dig> and a vegf gradient, g <dig> over the domain length. for cleaved vegf, there was no secretion, but there was clearance. protease activity and degradation were assumed to be uniform.

the volume-averaged clearance rate of soluble vegf in our model, kclear/ ~  <dig> ·10- <dig> s- <dig>  is similar in magnitude to clearance times in vivo  <cit>  and represents internalization by downstream cells and transvascular permeability.

steady-state assumption and consequences
the steady-state approximation assumed in our simulations is justified because vegf diffusion and reaction, which our model considers, occur much more rapidly than the structural changes in vessels and parenchymal cells, which may take days to weeks. transients in the vegf distribution are limited by the residence time of vegf in tissue, which has been experimentally  <cit>  and theoretically  <cit>  shown to be ~ <dig> h or less. the steady nature of the vegf distribution has been experimentally confirmed in the hindbrain, where the vegf distribution is relatively unchanged over an  <dig> h window  <cit>  and still maintains isoform specificity. if transient diffusion does contribute to the specificity of vegf gradients, we would expect vascular patterning to lose its isoform-dependence over long periods, which is not seen either in the retina  or in tumors . the same may be true for in vitro and ex vivo systems .

the vegf transport equations can be simplified at steady state. we perform the analysis for vegf <dig>  but the analysis is applicable to any isoform. in the absence of proteases, vegf is in equilibrium with hspg  thus the vegf diffusion equation reduces to:   

this equation states that vegf transport is not influenced by hspg binding. in the presence of proteases, vegf <dig> can be converted to vegf <dig>  and summation of the vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> equations and neglecting minor variations in the intrinsic diffusivity of the two isoforms, leads to:   

thus, the total soluble vegf is specified by the same equation regardless of the presence or distribution of vegf-cleaving proteases. if receptor-mediated internalization is identical between the isoforms , total soluble vegf should not be altered by proteases.

another important quantity, matrix-bound vegf, can be calculated using the relation,  = total - . assuming a uniform protease distribution, with proteolysis rate kp, we obtain   

note that for typical parameters used in this study, koff >> kp >> kon, we can approximate vegf/hspg binding by  ~ total/kd . the steady-state distribution of the soluble fraction of vegf can thus be described by:   

thus, vegf proteolysis is enhanced not only by the rate of proteolysis, kp, but also by matrix binding, which decreases vegf's effective diffusivity, deff = d/. as a result, matrix binding potentiates vegf proteolysis.

numerical methods for vegf calculations
the transport of vegf and the dynamics of hspg were solved using the finite volume method in cylindrical coordinates , figure  <dig>  the control volume spacing in the z direction was  <dig> μm. in the r direction, one voxel was used to represent the sprout radius, from r =  <dig> to r = rsprout; for r ≥ rsprout , spacing was 4- <dig> μm. a finer grid produces consistent results different by less than 5% and does not alter qualitative conclusions. heterogeneous reactions at the cell surface were approximated as homogenous reactions, using a basement membrane layer formulation given previously  <cit> .

the steady-state solution was obtained by solving the transient solution from the initial conditions until a relative convergence of 10- <dig> was achieved at each node. first-order temporal derivatives were discretized using a first order fully-implicit scheme, while the second-order spatial derivatives were discretized using a second order central difference method. nonlinear solution of the equations was found by iteration using the successive over-relaxation  update formulation and a red-black node ordering  <cit> . simulations were run on a personal computer using custom code written for matlab  <dig> . <dig> 

model implementation and initial conditions
because the cellular internalization of vegf creates a region of vegf depletion near the sprout, to be consistent we ran each simulation with an initial vegf gradient in the absence of proteases or degradation. we first imposed dirchelet bcs satisfying the overall domain gradient of vegf, g <dig>  and mean vegf concentration v <dig> at z =  <dig> : at z = +l,  = v0·, at z = -l,  = v0·), setting any degradation and proteolysis rates to be zero. this simulation can be done in the absence of hspgs to reach convergence more quickly since hspgs have no influence on steady-state soluble vegf under these conditions . after equilibration of diffusion and the vegf receptors, dirichlet bcs were converted into neumann bcs specified by q and kclear, defined using the following formulas:      

due to averaging over the respective boundaries, these equations only approximately specify the conditions, g <dig> and v0; however this is sufficient for our study. after this step, we incorporated hspgs and vegf-hspg complexes at equilibrium, any degradation terms and proteolytic reactions to arrive at the predicted steady-state spatial distribution.

geometrical and transport parameters
the tissue  is  <dig> μm long  and  <dig> μm in diameter  . the sprout is a cylinder from z = - <dig> μm to z =  <dig> with a radius of rsprout =  <dig> μm. these dimensions were chosen to reflect the average sprout size and sprout-to-sprout distance based on micrographs of sprouting vasculature  <cit> .

the matrix composition affects both the diffusivity and the available volume for vegf transport. we estimate the available volume fraction of the ecm as  <dig>  consistent with experimental data on transport studies of dextran in cellularized agarose gels  <cit> . diffusivity was calculated by estimation of the aqueous diffusivity, daq, at 37°c using data from berk et al. and the stokes-einstein relation  <cit> . the hindrance of the matrix was then approximated using ogston's relation, assuming a matrix composition of 14% v/v collagen fibrils ,  <dig> % v/v gag chains  as in  <cit> . finally, we corrected for the increased viscosity due to proteinacious interstitial solution   <cit> , resulting in d <dig> =  <dig>  μm2/s. despite a slight error, we standardized the results of the different vegf isoforms by assuming d <dig> for also vegf <dig>  vegf <dig>  and vegf <dig>  receptor movement is neglected as diffusivity along the cell surface, d ~  <dig>  μm2/s  <cit>  is much slower than reactions at the cell surface; the damköhler number is da = koff·ltip2/d =  <dig> 

kinetic parameters for reactions
to estimate the binding of vegf <dig> to hspgs, we used binding rates of bfgf to hspgs   <cit>  and adjusted kon to match kd estimates of vegf <dig> binding to heparin, kd ~  <dig> nm  <cit> . vegf <dig> binds to heparin and hspgs more strongly than does vegf <dig>  however no estimate for its kd had been made. based on extrapolation of vegf <dig> heparin elution data , we estimated a lower limit for kd of  <dig>  nm. vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> do not bind to hspg  <cit> . the overall rate of vegf cleavage by proteases in tissues is not known; but we assumed a rate that produces significant effects for our model parameters, kp =  <dig> ·10- <dig> s- <dig> , which is similar to vegf clearance rates in vivo.

we previously characterized kinetic parameters for the binding of vegf to vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and nrp <dig>  and for the coupling of the receptors   <cit> . while vegf <dig> has several fold greater affinity for vegfr <dig>  than vegf <dig>  <cit>  and vegf <dig> may bind nrp <dig> with low affinity  <cit> , we assume that the differences in the isoform binding to receptors are due to differences in nrp <dig> binding: no binding for vegf121; affinity for vegf <dig> higher than that of vegf <dig> in proportion to the isoforms' hspg affinity. the behavior of cleaved vegf <dig>  has been shown to be identical to that of vegf <dig>  <cit>  indicating similar receptor kinetics to vegf <dig>  finally, we assume receptors are internalized at a rate, kint, independent of vegf binding  <cit>  and that each vegfr is maintained at a constant level, i.e. sr <dig> = kint·total.

as described above, we studied a hypothetical continuum of vegf isoforms with properties intermediate between the three isoforms: we varied vegf receptor binding parameters along this continuum proportionally to the isoforms' affinity for hspgs. two opposing effects needed to be accounted for: the ability of vegf to couple vegfr <dig> and nrp <dig> and the ability of vegf to bind to the vegfr1-nrp <dig> complex. thus the vegf-nrp <dig> binding rate was konv,n <dig> = kon <dig> n1·. the coupling rate, kc, between vegf-vegfr <dig> and nrp <dig> was also increased by the same factor to preserve equilibrium. in contrast, vegf binding to the vegfr1-nrp <dig> complex and nrp <dig> coupling to the vegf-vegfr <dig> complex was higher for shorter isoforms, with k'forward = kforward·/kd <dig> h and kreverse unchanged, for isoform hspg binding affinities greater than kd <dig> h =  <dig> nm .

a degradation rate constant of kdeg = 10- <dig> s- <dig> was used to estimate the impact of significant degradation. as we will see, total degradation is independent of the isoform if the hspg-bound isoforms are protected against degradation. conversely, degradation is isoform-specific when the heavier isoforms can be degraded when bound to hspgs as well as in solution. the heavier isoforms will be degraded more due to their longer residence time.

concentrations of receptors and hspg
concentrations of vegf, abluminal vegf receptors, and ecm hspg were estimated previously  <cit>  . vegf levels were taken to be v <dig> =  <dig> pm as previously determined from the literature  <cit> . we assume that each endothelial cell has a fixed population of vegfr maintained by a balance of receptor insertion into the plasma membrane and internalization. we assumed a base condition of total =  <dig> and total =  <dig> per vascular surface corresponding to the area of a tip cell . to account for the excess of nrp <dig>  we use total = 3· <dig> molecules/ <dig> μm <dig>  the binding site density of hspg in the ecm was  <dig> nm  <cit> .

definition of gradient metrics for vegf isoforms and vegf receptors
endothelial cells may sense absolute or relative gradients of vegf  <cit> . for initiation of vascular sprouting, the gradient across one cell is likely to be sensed. for sprout extension and maintenance of the tip cell/stalk cell differentiation, the signaling difference between two cells  may be more relevant.

in the present study we consider gradients only between the front and back of the surface of the tip cell, with mean concentrations  defined over the tip cell's entire surface. the absolute gradient, denoted by agv or Δtip is the difference in vegf concentration between the tip cell front and back. note that the absolute gradient is additive over all isoforms, e.g. agv = ag <dig> + ag <dig> for a two isoform distribution. the steepness of the vegf distribution  is the absolute gradient normalized to either the mean tip total soluble vegf, i.e. fractional gradient or fg <dig>  or to the mean tip concentration of the isoform under consideration, e.g. ifg165:      

note that the above metrics differ only in the presence of multiple vegf isoforms.

we use similar definitions to find gradients of cell-surface vegf-bound receptor complexes. in this case, the gradient is limited to the axial  direction due to rotational symmetry in our model. we normalize the absolute gradient of receptor complexes to the total amount of a particular receptor, e.g.:   

where total, tip is the sum of all forms of vegfr <dig> on the tip cell surface. using the fractional occupancy  of a vegf isoform to a vegf receptor, the fractional gradient of vegf <dig> bound to vegfr <dig> in a system consisting of isoforms vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> can be expressed as:   

we introduce the concept of sensitivity, s, to define the multiplicative relation between a metric in vegfr <dig> binding and a similar metric in the vegf distribution, e.g. sifg- <dig> = ifg165-r2/ifg <dig>  note that sifg also describes the factor increase in the fractional occupancy  given a factor increase in , strictly valid only in the differential limit:   

for a single receptor detecting a single ligand, sifg is always less than  <dig>  .

additional assumptions
we assume that degradation and proteolysis is uniformly distributed. our model does not also fully reflect the contribution of vasculature to vegf transport. while vasculature-mediated internalization is thought to represent the primary clearance for vegf in tissue  <cit> , our model only implicitly represents such effects , neglecting isoform-specific variation. we also assume constant internalization and insertion rates for the vegf receptors, resulting in constant total receptor population on the sprout. this is justified because we are primarily interested in the sensory role of the sprout and not in its internalization capacity, however ligand-induced shifts in nrp <dig> and vegfr <dig> may also alter sensory function. mechanistic models of these processes have not been developed and thus we did not incorporate them in the current study.

RESULTS
the computational model predicts that the steady-state distribution of soluble vegf is isoform-independent when considering only diffusion and matrix binding
when vegf is secreted, extracellular hspgs are predicted not to influence the distribution of the soluble fraction of vegf ; nor do they influence receptor signaling , assuming vegf-hspg complexes in the ecm cannot directly ligate vegf receptors. at steady state, each molecule of vegf that binds to the matrix is matched by a molecule that unbinds. note that using physiological parameters, vegf concentration is significantly below the kd for matrix binding  resulting in hspg binding sites remaining unsaturated; in this regime, matrix-bound vegf concentration is linearly proportional to soluble  vegf concentration at all spatial positions.

at the tip cell, the absolute gradient of unbound vegf is ~ <dig>  pm/ <dig> μm. the direction of the gradient of receptor signaling  is the same, with magnitude ~ <dig> vegf-vegfr2/ <dig> μm. the relative steepness  of both the vegf and vegf-vegfr <dig> distributions are similar, ifgvegf =  <dig> %/ <dig> μm and ifgvegf-vegfr <dig> =  <dig> %/ <dig> μm. thus, the sensitivity of vegfr <dig> binding to vegf gradients  is high . note that vegf receptors also locally deplete vegf and thereby influence the diffusion of vegf ; in the case shown, receptors capture ~39% of the secreted vegf.

differences in vegf gradients can arise from differences in vegf degradation
the lack of influence of hspgs on vegf gradients at steady state suggests that different isoforms secreted at the same rate , and differing only in hspg binding, will have similar soluble vegf distributions . matrix-bound vegf increases with hspg affinity of the isoform , as does the total amount of extracellular vegf . however, because bound vegf is proportional to soluble vegf, the relative gradients of matrix-bound vegf are the same for each isoform. over the simulated length scales, total vegf concentration gradients of different isoforms would not intersect , regardless of hspg concentration . thus, differential hspg binding of isoforms is not sufficient to account for observed vegf patterning in vivo .

we simulated whether a patterned ecm  could cause the observed gradients, but this scenario also did not lead to isoform-specific differences in soluble vegf; however, it did lead to larger isoforms having steeper distributions in bound and total vegf . still, vegf levels between different isoforms are not predicted to intersect within the spatial frame of reference.

we first considered whether the steady-state assumption was accurate, since transient diffusion of isoforms having different hspg affinities can momentarily lead to differential isoform patterning. however, experimental evidence points to vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> having rapid kinetics in vivo   <cit> , which likely indicates that vegf patterning operates close to steady state. we will consider the ability of vegf-cleaving proteases to create these spatial distributions; however, it is of note that vegf fragments have not yet been observed in developing tissues  <cit> .

next, we considered vegf degradation . in vivo, vegf diffuses in an environment filled with cells, which may selectively uptake vegf isoforms, e.g. through cell surface receptors, possibly in conjunction with nrp <dig> or cell-surface hs  <cit> : these effects are incorporated into the vegf degradation term of our model. degradation may also result from vegf inactivation by isoform-selective vegf inhibitors, e.g. connective tissue growth factor, svegfr <dig>  thrombospondin- <dig>  or by proteases that can cleave vegf to fragments that are not recognized by commonly employed antibodies.

as described in the methods section, we considered two specific cases for degradation: first, the "soluble vegf degradation model" in which hspg-bound vegf is protected from degradation ; and the "matrix-sequestered vegf degradation" model, in which hspg-bound vegf can be degraded . the former is similar to heparin-bound bfgf being protected against plasmin cleavage  <cit> .

computational simulations suggest that when hspgs protect vegf , the soluble vegf distribution is independent of hspg binding, as if the hspgs were not even present. the relative gradients of the vegf isoforms are equal  and thus cannot recapitulate isoform-dependent localization. in addition, total vegf in the system is approximately proportional to the hspg binding affinity.

in contrast, when hspg-bound vegf is vulnerable to degradation , the different grading of vegf isoforms seen in vivo  is recapitulated  <cit> . specifically, the strongly heparin-binding vegf <dig> produces a very steep distribution . as a consequence of this, close to the source of secretion, increased ecm-binding affinity  corresponds to increased levels of bound vegf; but at sufficiently far distances, this trend is reversed and the highly diffusible isoform is more abundant . despite different spatial localization, the total amount of vegf in the system is similar for each isoform , and may be consistent with data from  <cit> .

proteolytic cleavage of bound vegf increases soluble vegf only in a model of isoform-specific degradation
vegf cleavage  is also an important modulator of vascular patterning and experimentally, increased cleavage seems to mimic the effects of reduced hspg binding affinity: increase in soluble vegf, increase in range of the vegf signal with a simultaneous decrease in the magnitude of the vegf gradient, decrease in matrix-bound vegf, and possibly, preservation of the total tissue vegf levels  <cit> . here we consider the role of vegf-cleaving proteases on the vegf distribution of the different isoforms for two different scenarios: the hspg-binding-only model, which provides a reference case  and the model including matrix-sequestered vegf degradation , which we saw above can result in vegf isoform gradients similar to those observed experimentally. we assume vegf cleavage can act on both soluble and matrix-bound vegf.

surprisingly, inclusion of proteolytic cleavage did not affect total soluble vegf levels in the hspg-binding-only model, despite reducing levels of uncleaved  vegf and producing vegf <dig>  a non-hspg binding diffusible isoform . mathematical analysis indicates that this effect is similar to the hspg binding independence noted earlier. proteases are predicted to reduce matrix-bound vegf levels , due to a proportional decrease in uncleaved vegf, which is accompanied by a significant steepening of these distributions . comparing the different vegf isoforms, proteases cleave vegf <dig> much more thoroughly than vegf <dig>  while total vegf in the vegf <dig> system  is not affected by proteolysis because its cleavage produces an equivalent isoform. this potentiation of vegf proteolytic cleavage by hspg binding is due to increased residence time of the matrix-binding isoforms.

in contrast, with the inclusion of matrix-sequestered vegf degradation , proteolytic release of vegf resulted in increased soluble vegf levels, size of this increase was proportional to the matrix affinity of the uncleaved isoform . furthermore, both the soluble vegf and total vegf distributions have reduced gradients  indicating that vegf gradients can be disrupted by proteases in this model. matrix-bound vegf decreased due to the action of protease; however, its decrease was not as significant as in the hspg-binding-only model, due to the existence of vegf degradation processes. overall, the total vegf amount in each tissue is well preserved by the action of proteases .

we note that in each case, cleaved vegf has a nearly flat concentration profile, a consequence of it not being secreted at a single location. this contrasts with the uncleaved soluble and bound fractions, which are proportional to each other and are sharpened by proteases. another surprising finding is that in the presence of isoform-specific degradation, the concentration of cleaved vegf is similar in each isoform system . as described in more detail in additional file  <dig>  section s <dig>  this is a result of total vegf being preserved, indicating that the residence time of each isoform, and hence the time available for cleavage to occur, is similar.

correlating vegf patterning to vascular patterning suggests total soluble vegf may be an optimal vegf signal
using the vegf patterning in vivo as recapitulated in the model, we now ask whether there is a viable vegf-based guidance cue for cell sensing that is consistent with the twin observed properties: monotonic increase in vascular density with isoform length; and the opposite effect of vegf cleavage . we present results for vegf near the tip cell , with an extended range of vegf isoforms and mmp activity levels to compare, side-by-side, the isoform dependence and the mmp-based proteolytic dependence .

in the hspg-binding-only model , total soluble vegf is constant, and thus is unlikely to carry relevant information regarding vessel patterning. instead, such information could come from changes in: soluble uncleaved vegf; cleaved vegf; or matrix-bound vegf. in order for a signal to recapitulate the isoform and mmp dependence shown in figure 1b, it should behave in the same fashion to decreasing hspg affinity as it does to increasing mmp activity. in the context of figure  <dig>  that means that the behavior moving to the right along the x-axis should be the same on the hspg and mmp graphs. here however, levels of soluble uncleaved vegf increase monotonically as the hspg affinity of the secreted isoform decreases , but decrease as mmp activity increases. cleaved vegf  is also inconsistent. matrix-bound vegf, however, has a biphasic behavior; at the tip cell, isoforms with intermediate and lower affinity to hspgs satisfy the requirement that mmp effects oppose hspg binding effects, but above an affinity limit this is violated . this biphasic effect arises because greater matrix binding affinity results in greater accumulation close to the source of secretion, but also more rapid deterioration of the signal in space caused by proteolysis over a longer residence time. this effect was also seen in figure 5b, as total vegf <dig> levels fall below those of vegf <dig> at the tip cell. note that the closer the tip cell is to the source, the greater the likelihood that the monotonic behavior between isoforms is maintained, indicating that the distance from the vegf source, all other factors being equal, may be a major determinant of isoform-specific vascular patterning.

in the matrix-sequestered vegf degradation model , soluble uncleaved vegf, cleaved vegf, and matrix-bound vegf follow similar behavior as in the above hspg-binding-only model. however, total soluble vegf is not constant in this model. interestingly, while neither soluble uncleaved nor cleaved vegf are individually viable guidance cues, their sum , displays the desired behavior, increasing with decreased isoform affinity to the matrix and with increased mmp activity, though at sufficiently high affinities, the differences at hspg affinities larger than that of vegf <dig> are not large. in addition, this behavior is present over the entire range of parameters, indicating that it is robust in its ability reproduce vascular patterning.

in both models , total vegf and total uncleaved vegf  , display similar biphasic behaviors as does matrix-bound vegf and thus do not enhance the signal provided by the matrix-bound form. the model also predicts the magnitude of vegf gradients present near the tip cell. while fractional gradients appear to be significantly poorer candidates for guidance cues than are vegf concentrations, absolute gradients seem to be as effective as vegf concentrations . absolute gradients greatly extend the range of isoforms for which matrix-bound vegf in the hspg-binding-only model displays isoform monotonicity , however in the matrix-sequestered vegf degradation model, it seems to show little variation with respect to changes in mmp activity, indicating weak hspg/mmp antagonism .

effects of receptor binding on isoform monotonicity and hspg/mmp antagonism
endothelial cells respond not to vegf gradients directly but to vegf receptor activation. can vegf receptors accurately sense total soluble vegf, which we identified as a potential cue, or do other extracellular signals become relevant? note that in the absence of nrp <dig> expression, vegfr <dig> and vegfr <dig> binding will be similar to the soluble distributions given in figure  <dig>  because uncleaved and cleaved vegf isoforms bind similarly to the vegf receptors. the presence of nrp <dig> may compensate for the inability of longer isoforms to diffuse far in tissues.

we imposed the vegf distributions calculated in figure  <dig> onto our model of vegf receptor interactions . vegfr <dig> binding was similar for the matrix-sequestered vegf degradation model  and the hspg-binding-only model . vegfr <dig> binding shows greatest binding at isoform affinities between vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  violating isoform monotonicity , a result of the isoform-specific potentiation of the underlying uncleaved vegf by nrp <dig>  at high enough matrix affinities this is, however, unable to compensate for the low levels of uncleaved vegf seen for these isoforms. we note that uncleaved vegf <dig>  cannot bind vegfr <dig>  <cit> , though its cleavage product can; this does not significantly alter the shape of the curve , as most vegf <dig> is cleaved 

we note that when the uncleaved isoform exhibits strong hspg binding, total soluble vegf is due primarily to cleaved vegf, and when the uncleaved isoform has minimal ecm binding, then cleaved vegf is not significant . a similar feature was noted in vegfr <dig> binding in the presence of nrp <dig> . as a result, we also tested the potential role of vegfr <dig> signaling in recapitulating total soluble vegf signaling . total vegfr <dig> binding displays a greater range of isoform monotonic behavior than vegfr <dig> binding, however, it is limited only up to the vegf <dig> isoform, beyond which vegfr <dig> binding remains flat or may actually increase with increased matrix-binding affinity .

discussion
our study proposes an important reinterpretation of the role of hspgs and vegf-cleaving proteases in the control of vegf patterning in vivo. our central proposition is that differential isoform degradation , and not a difference in diffusion arising from hspg binding, controls the spatial localization of vegf in tissues .

in the developing hindbrain system, vegf <dig> distributes in a much more disperse manner  than vegf <dig>  <cit> . we find that while vegf <dig> may diffuse slower in tissues than vegf <dig>  differences in grading will only arise when vegf <dig> is also degraded more rapidly by the surrounding hindbrain parenchyma, possibly due to specific uptake by cell surface hspgs or nrp <dig>  preventing it from diffusing far . we propose that this difference in degradation rates between isoforms  also explains why secretion of non-heparin binding isoforms such as vegf <dig> or vegf <dig> leads to greater vegf levels in the solution phase of tissues than secretion of heavier isoforms, given identical secretion rates  <cit> . note that assuming a simpler mechanism of reversible hspg binding in an in vivo system is not able to explain this behavior at steady state . importantly, our mechanism of isoform-specific degradation also provides a general explanation for the phenomena of protease-mediated redistribution of vegf activity: proteases, by either cleaving vegf  <cit> , cleaving hspgs  <cit> , or by cleaving vegf inhibitors  <cit> , inhibit the degradation of vegf , thereby leading to the accumulation of vegf in tissues and an increased range of receptor activation on the vasculature. this hypothesis is distinct from what is commonly noted in the literature as vegf release, in which vegf is focally released from the matrix by the action of proteases and diffuses to activate vasculature.

the second thrust of our current work is the elucidation of how vegf isoforms and vegf-releasing proteases might regulate vascular morphology . we originally asked the question: which vegf metrics may be responsible for guiding vascular patterning, to recapitulate both isoform monotonicity  <cit>  and the protease dependence in vascular patterning  <cit> ? we identified several possibilities including the levels of matrix-bound vegf, soluble vegf levels, nrp <dig> dependent signaling, and even vegf gradient directionality. using the results of our model, we can now provide a more specific answer to this question.

for example, the model predicts as expected that vegf188-secreting tumors would have the greatest levels of peritumoral matrix-bound vegf  <cit> , however, farther away at the vascular front, matrix-bound vegf levels may actually be lower than if vegf <dig> were being secreted . thus, how a sprout experiences the ordering of the isoforms by sensing matrix-bound vegf may not always be monotonic with respect to the heparin binding affinity of the vegf isoform; it will be dependent on the distance between the sprout and the vegf source .  instead, the possibility that vegf189-secreting systems also have the lowest levels of soluble vegf of the different isoform-expressing systems seems to be consistent, even in the presence of proteases .

an important alternative to the concentration of matrix-bound vegf levels may however be its directionality, especially as vegf <dig> seems to have the sharpest distributions in the absence of proteases . while this holds true in the absence of proteases and can possibly explain observations in the mouse hindbrain  <cit> , this metric does not account for the effect of vegf-cleaving proteases, which further sharpen the distribution, instead of behaving in a hspg-antagonistic fashion . vegf <dig> also may have stronger nrp <dig> binding than vegf <dig>  <cit> , however our results show that soluble uncleaved vegf <dig> levels may be so low , that total nrp1-potentiated vegfr <dig> signaling may be weaker than that in vegf165-secreting systems. in fact, our model shows a surprising result: vegfr <dig> binding of total soluble vegf seems to better reconcile both isoform monotonicity and the antagonistic relationship between hspg affinity and mmp activity than vegfr <dig> binding does .

our results may provide insight into the nature of several experimental observations regarding vascular patterning. a comparison of our results to those of ruhrberg et al's hindbrain data suggest that while the overall vegf distribution is spatially non-monotonic   <cit> , the underlying soluble fraction of vegf is monotonic and is the basis for endothelial behavior. we note, however, that several important biological effects need to first be taken into account, for example the roles of filopodia  <cit>  and the direct receptor signaling of matrix-bound vegf  <cit> .

the loss of monotonicity for matrix-bound vegf  is a result of the isoform-dependent decrease of the soluble uncleaved vegf fraction in space. we now discuss how the tip cell filopodia can contribute to the process of isoform sensing. by projecting out in front of the tip cell, filopodia may be able to detect a region of space where matrix-bound vegf may in fact operate in an isoform-monotonic manner , effectively increasing the spatial range of the matrix-bound vegf fraction's isoform monotonicity. we conceptualize this to sprouting angiogenesis. in the initial stages of sprouting where the sprout is far away from the vegf source, only soluble vegf will exhibit isoform monotonicity. however, as a sprout continues to invade closer into the vegf secreting tissue, matrix-bound vegf signaling and vegf gradients will also exhibit the correct isoform monotonicity . these effects would be relevant in vivo as vegf gradients never seem to be more than  <dig> μm in front of the vascular front  <cit> , a range that can easily be sensed by filopodia  <cit> . thus, while total soluble vegf is theoretically the most isoform-monotonic signal, there may be no practical differences between it and matrix-bound vegf. in fact, the information provided in matrix-bound vegf may be even more relevant than that of soluble vegf as it can result in differential vegfr <dig> signaling that favors activation of p38/mapk compared to soluble vegf  <cit>  and may mediate increased interaction with cell-surface nrp <dig>  <cit> , both of which may play a direct role in branching and migration behaviors leading to increased vascular density. unlike the behavior of matrix-bound vegf, an isoform monotonic signal in nrp1-mediated vegfr <dig> signaling does not necessarily emerge as a sprout invades into the vegf secreting tissue  , indicating that nrp1-mediated vegfr <dig> signaling may be less capable of giving rise to isoform-specific increases in vascular branching complexity. however, this conclusion is based on assuming a model where receptors only bind soluble vegf; how the signaling of matrix-bound vegf changes these conclusions is not known.

our results indicated that vegfr <dig> signaling of soluble vegf may be able to also mediate isoform-specific differences in vascular patterning. however, this conclusion is at odds with the vegfr2-dependent nature of angiogenesis in the retina  <cit> , in in vitro patterning of porcine aortic endothelial cells  <cit> , and in mmp <dig> induced carcinogenesis  <cit> . in addition, vegfr <dig> signaling supports migratory behavior through p38/mapk  <cit> , however our results suggest an inhibitory role of vegfr <dig> signaling on vascular density . while our model cannot elucidate the importance of vegfr <dig> signaling, it is interesting to note that when vegfr <dig> signaling is monotonically increasing with the isoform length, vegfr <dig> signaling is decreasing, suggesting that a balance between the two receptors may be important.

the unique role of matrix-bound vegf in mediating the branching phenotype through filopodia may offer an interesting solution to the paradoxes of vegf-cleaving mmps in tumor growth. for example, both vegf <dig> tumors and vegf164Δ108- <dig> tumors are similar in that they have higher intratumoral vascular density and lower-diameter vessels compared to vegf <dig> tumors; however, whereas vegf164Δ108- <dig> tumors are markedly more proliferative than vegf <dig> tumors  <cit> , vegf <dig> tumors show negligible growth  <cit> . we may conclude that this discrepancy indicates that the resulting vascular beds in the two tumors are different in ways that the intratumoral vessel density cannot measure, for example, in their connectivity to peritumoral vasculature  <cit> , which may be a limiting factor for nutrient delivery; we propose that a separate aspect of vegf signaling controls this latter behavior. our model suggests a crucial difference between the two tumors: while vegf <dig> tumors show minimal vegfr <dig> activation, even less than that of vegf <dig> tumors, vegf164Δ108- <dig> tumors instead show even higher vegfr <dig> activation than vegf <dig> tumors . as a result, it may be possible that the ability of the vasculature to support tissue growth may be dictated by vegfr <dig> activation at the vessel itself, due to the receptor binding behavior of soluble vegf, as suggested in numerous studies  <cit> . furthermore, notice that peak vegfr <dig> activation occurs between the vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> isoforms . this may support the observation that vegf <dig> is at least as tumorigenic as vegf <dig> in some systems due to intrinsic differences between systems  <cit> . overall, we hypothesize that intratumoral vessel density and branching is determined by matrix-bound vegf detected by filopodia removed from the vessel surface, while vessel efficacy is dictated by vegfr <dig> activation at the vessel body. as a result, we thus posit that the tumorigenic behavior ultimately depends on the ability of vegf to keep its receptor and nrp <dig> binding domains intact. the inability of vegf <dig> tumors to elicit vegfr <dig> activation, despite it potentially having higher affinity to nrp <dig> than vegf <dig>  is a result of its degradation and cleavage .

this hypothesis may also explain the paradoxical roles of specific proteases in tumorigenesis. our mechanism of mmp-mediated vegf redistribution  shows that proteases will increase the functional soluble vegf concentration by inhibiting the process of vegf degradation. however, while several modes of vegf redistribution, such as through mmp <dig>  heparinases, or vegf inhibitor cleavage are implicated as pro-tumorigenic, mediating an angiogenic switch  <cit> , there are several notable exceptions where protease activity instead leads to diminished tumor growth  <cit> , an effect similar to the plasmin-mediated loss of wound healing due to a loss of angiogenesis  <cit> . we note an important trend: in studies where pro-tumorigenic behavior occurs from vegf release, vegf has not been shown to be directly cleaved. bergers et al have shown that mmp <dig> mediates vegf-release induced carcinogenesis in pancreatic islets  <cit>  without determining the mechanism of release. however, subsequent studies have shown that mmp <dig> does not necessarily cleave vegf  <cit> , as suggested by  <cit> , but instead acts to cleave hspgs directly  <cit> . in fact, joyce et al  <cit>  show that mmps and heparinases have similar effects in the pancreatic islet system, which strengthens the argument that the mmp <dig> induced angiogenic switch in  <cit>  may have been mediated by hspg cleavage. in contrast, studies where proteases reduce the angiogenic potential of vegf show direct evidence of vegf being cleaved and/or degraded  <cit> . we propose that vegf needs to maintain coreceptor domains for effective tumorigenesis. cleavage of vegf, while increasing the total soluble vegf concentration, may decrease overall vegfr <dig> activation due to a loss of nrp <dig> binding ; heparinases, mmp <dig>  and vegf inhibitor proteases also prevent vegf degradation but redistribute intact, coreceptor-binding vegf.

our results suggest that a central facet of vegf patterning in vivo is its degradation, which we show necessarily occurs in an isoform-specific manner. several mechanisms may underlie vegf's isoform-specific degradation, and it is not currently known what, if any, mechanisms operate in the different in vivo experimental systems used. interstitial cells and endothelial cells from nearby vessels may uptake vegf isoform in an hspg- or nrp1- dependent manner. this is supported by observations that nrp <dig> and vegf receptors are typically present in many types of parenchyma, e.g. hindbrain  <cit> , astrocytes  <cit> , tumor  <cit> , and skeletal muscle  <cit> . on the other hand, degradation may be due to the action of vegf-degrading proteases, possibly the same proteases that also initially cleave vegf; however, this possibility does not seem to be consistent with developmental systems where vegf cleavage has not been detected  <cit> . an interesting possibility that has recently been raised is that of vegf inhibition by soluble vegf inhibitors, e.g. svegfr <dig>  <cit>  or connective tissue growth factor  <cit> , operating in an isoform-dependent manner through either hspg complexation or through nrp <dig> complexation. interestingly, each of these mechanisms also supports the ability of proteases to allow vegf to escape degradation, through either hspg binding or nrp <dig> binding, mediating vegf redistribution. an important uncertainty in vegf catabolism is whether endothelial cells represent the primary source of vegf receptors and degradation in vivo or not. for example, while the background neural progenitor cells in the hindbrain may express nrp <dig>  <cit> , endothelial expression is typically thought to be very strong  <cit> . furthermore, immunochemical staining usually shows that vegf concentrations diminish precisely at the vascular front  <cit> .

besides being able to reproduce experimental observations of vegf patterning in vivo, is there evidence for isoform-specific degradation in tissues? vegf  has been shown to degrade in vitro under cell culture conditions  <cit>  and in fact, proteases that cleave vegf into shorter isoforms also seem to degrade it further  <cit> . in addition, while vegf degradation has not typically been studied as a cause of vegf patterning, this view is commonly accepted in numerous developmental systems   <cit> . evidence for isoform-specific degradation however may come from an indirect source. perlecan knockdown in zebrafish establishes a diffusible vegf phenotype  <cit> . surprisingly, it also increased total tissue vegf levels. relevant to the present study is the fact that total vegf levels did not decrease, supporting the view that hspgs may be important mediators of vegf degradation. however, there are other pieces of evidence that seem to contradict isoform-specific degradation: intravenously-injected bevacizumab shows significantly greater tumoral deposition in vegf189-expressing tumors compared to vegf <dig> tumors and vegf <dig> tumors  <cit> . preliminary computational results suggest that this observation supports the hspg-binding-only model on the basis of the total number of bevacizumab binding sites, i.e. vegf, increases proportionally to the vegf isoform matrix affinity.

an interesting prediction of the isoform-specific degradation model is that the extracellular residence times of different vegf isoforms are roughly equal. thus, a test of the model can be made by injecting labeled vegf isoforms into tissues and measuring their half-lives in the interstitial fluid or lymph. if this test shows that the longer isoforms have significantly greater residence times in tissues, it would disprove the isoform-specific degradation model. the residence time of vegf in tissues is a direct measure of the overall degradation and clearance rate, and its constancy is identical to the statement that the total levels of vegf in tissue are roughly constant against differences in patterns of isoform secretion and vegf proteolysis, a finding that is suggested by results in  <cit> . note that this statement, however, does not contradict isoform-specific degradation. in this model, the rate of degradation  of the soluble fraction of vegf is isoform specific, with heavier isoforms showing more rapid degradation; however, accounting for all phases of vegf , the average rate of degradation of any vegf isoform is nearly identical .

overall, our results form the basis for a different view of vegf patterning and endothelial behavior in response to vegf. the assumption behind how vegf patterning is intuitively interpreted is that of the transient: transiently, mmps elicit vegf release, which can increase vegf receptor signaling on endothelial cells  <cit> , and hspgs do hinder diffusion, forming isoform-specific differences in soluble vegf patterning. however, this assumption ignores what happens to the vegf distribution over much longer periods of time, which are likely just as important for slowly evolving processes such as vascular patterning. the transient assumption only seems valid in studying in vitro systems, systems where vegf is cleared very slowly  <cit> . on the other hand, in vivo systems seem to represent a major phenomenological difference due to their much more rapid vegf dynamics , necessitating a steady-state analysis. several additional assumptions have also been made in our analysis . for example, we assumed that the intrinsic proteolytic cleavage rate of all isoforms is identical. however, experimental studies indicate that vegf <dig> may be more resistant to mmps than vegf <dig>  <cit> . this point is interesting to note since another study,  <cit> , found that vegf <dig>  also results in angiogenesis with high vascular density  <cit> , similar to vegf164Δ108- <dig> formed vessels  <cit> . since the inability to be further cleaved/degraded may be the common theme, it may indicate that an inability to be cleaved/degraded alternately underlies higher vascular densities in those systems. finally, in the current study, we specifically tested hspg binding as the mechanism of isoform specificity in vegf degradation. however, our results do not change if the isoform-specific degradation occurs solely through soluble vegf being degraded in an isoform-specific manner , such as in a nrp1-dependent fashion.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have identified a general mechanism of vegf transport that explains experimental data regarding vegf isoform patterning and proteolytic release at steady state, that of isoform specific degradation. we have further highlighted possible mechanisms by which information in the vegf distribution can be used to guide vascular patterning in an attempt to explain vascular branching complexity and also the regulation of angiogenesis and tumor growth by proteases. a major limitation of our present study is that we were only able to broadly consider isoform ordering with respect to one or two features of the vegf distribution. instead, sprout formation and the subsequent patterning may be the result of a complex, temporal orchestration of multiple extracellular vegf fractions, receptor signaling states, and cell types. such an analysis is outside the scope of our study, however rule-based cell models and other modeling efforts are being developed to the sophistication required to address the multifactorial problem of vascular patterning, e.g.  <cit> . many studies implement vegf degradation and/or ecm binding and proteolysis  <cit>  however not in a form, that as we show, gives rise to differential vegf gradients seen in vivo  <cit> . we believe that the advances made in our study, specifically the necessity of a mechanism of isoform-specific degradation, would be useful to such studies to improve the predictions of the vegf distribution.

important biological questions remain to be addressed, especially regarding the existence and nature of isoform-specific vegf degradation, the nature of the mmp induced angiogenic switch, and the possible role of soluble inhibitors such as svegfr <dig> in sprout formation, isoform patterning, and in the protease-mediated angiogenic switch.
