BACKGROUND
mirnas are endogenous non-protein-coding rnas  of approximately  <dig> nt  <cit> . they have the potential to bind to 3' utrs of mrnas via sequence complementarity and, with the aid of other cofactors, down-regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . an increasing body of evidence has shown that mirnas function not only during development  <cit>  but also in disease progression   <cit> . viruses also use mirnas for host cell invasion and to maintain their parasitism  <cit> . hence, many scientists have undertaken studies to delineate the physiological functions of mirnas and such work will be potentiated by the discovery of novel mirnas.

direct cloning of mirnas in cells is often dominated by a few highly expressed mirnas. in some cases, novel mirnas have been difficult to detect in cells due to their small size and low abundance  <cit> . although many experimental or/and computational procedures have been developed to identify mirnas, these procedures still have some disadvantages. the traditional biological method, direct cloning, is limited by the need to acquire a large amount of rna starting material. in addition, a few highly expressed mirnas usually constitute the majority of the cloned products, and therefore most low-abundance mirnas are difficult to detect with direct cloning  <cit> . as an alternative, some investigators have developed bioinformatic algorithms that predict mirnas from genome sequences. several studies have reported serial pipelines to predict mirnas from caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila, arabidopsis and human  <cit> . in brief, these studies used various programs to predict [potential hairpin sequences within genomic sequences. these candidate hairpins were then examined by additional filters. although these procedures have predicted many candidates with the potential to form qualified hairpins, only a limited number of hairpins have been confirmed experimentally on the basis of expression due to the difficulty of large-scale expression validation and low prediction accuracy for expressed mirnas.

the difficulty in direct cloning of cellular mirnas may reflect either tissue- or stage-specific expression or may be a consequence of physiological stress in addition to problem of low abundance. therefore, it is difficult to choose the appropriate biological samples from which to extract mirnas. moreover, because mirnas are short and single-stranded, they are unstable and likely to be degraded soon after tissues or cells are lysed, thereby compounding the difficulties in isolating and detecting these rnas. on the other hand, bioinformatic discovery of expressed mirnas may be more successful if expressed transcripts are used for input rather than genomic dna sequences, because the majority of a genome sequence cannot be transcribed into rna. therefore, the use of expressed transcript information offers some advantages for bioinformatic detection of expressed mirnas.

our preliminary scan showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> known pre-mirnas are present in the est and intronic sequence dataset. lee and colleagues presented the first direct evidence that mirna genes can be transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . ying and lin demonstrated that some of the known mirnas are derived from introns of protein-coding genes  <cit> . rodriguez et al. found that mammalian mirnas overlap not only with introns of protein-coding genes but also introns and exons of mrna-like non-coding rnas. in addition, they found only a few mirnas located in protein-coding transcripts  <cit> . these studies indicate that it is beneficial to use expressed transcript information to extract potential mirna sequences.

based on the findings and conclusions of previous reports, we used human reference gene intronic sequences as raw data to predict human mirnas. in addition, we also analyzed human est sequences, excluding those encoding proteins, to predict mirnas originating from independent transcription units distinct from previously annotated genes.

RESULTS
predicting hairpins from human ests and intronic sequences using srnaloop
the most obvious feature of pre-mirna  is the hairpin structure, which is folded via intramolecular base pairing. we used the program srnaloop, developed by grad et al.  <cit> , to predict hairpins from raw sequence data. when operating srnaloop, we used the parameter "-lml 10" to confine possible hairpins to those having a terminal loop ≥  <dig> nt based on the report of zeng et al.  <cit> . we also adjusted many other parameters to optimize the operating results . according to our initial survey, there were originally  <dig> known human pre-mirnas in our raw data,  <dig> of them in intronic sequences and  <dig> in est sequences, and the combination of parameters we selected was lenient enough to acquire  <dig> %  of these pre-mirnas. subsequently, we acquired  <dig> , <dig> candidate hairpins from human ests  and intronic sequences  using srnaloop, and these hairpins were further processed by the sequence & structural features filter based on the features of the  <dig> known pre-mirnas  <cit> .

inferring the locations of mature mirnas
the hairpin finding procedure yielded candidate pre-mirnas in which the candidate mature mirnas are primarily located in one of the arms of the precursor hairpin. as shown in figure  <dig>  if dicer, an rnase iii involved in mirna maturation, precisely cuts the terminal loop at the loop/stem junction, we can infer that the mature mirnas located approximately at  or , where pfn and ptn represent the positions of the first and terminal nucleotides of the terminal loop, respectively. given the difficulty in precisely predicting pre-mirna secondary structure, the actual size of a terminal loop might be larger or smaller, complicating the mirna boundary prediction. to overcome this problem, we extended the length of each putative mirna stem sequence by two nucleotides at both ends . we thus acquired 26-nt putative mirnas, each of which distributed at  or  within each candidate hairpin, and was thus named using the suffix "5p" or "3p", respectively. we first tested this boundary prediction strategy by inferring mature mirnas from  <dig> known pre-mirnas containing a hairpin structure that were predicted by srnaloop from the original  <dig> mirna registry entries. as shown in figure 2a, in  <dig> of  <dig> known mature mirnas, more than 90% of the sequences were identical to the corresponding 26-nt mirna locations defined here. among these  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> mature mirnas were perfectly matched the corresponding putative 26-nt sequences. this information demonstrated that we could obtain useful mature mirna sequence regions within the candidate pre-mirnas for subsequent analysis by allowing such wobbling boundary determination, although our study here will not be able to precisely locate the true mature mirnas.

sequence & structural features filter
there were many fragments that could be predicted to fold into a hairpin structure, but only a few of them represented authentic pre-mirnas. therefore, we needed the sequence & structural features filter devised based on known mirna features, to distinguish authentic candidates from false positives. as presented in table  <dig>  the criteria of the sequence & structural features filter are composed of four indices, namely gc content, core minimum free energy , hairpin mfe and the ratio of core mfe to hairpin mfe . the definition of these quantifiable features and how to calculate them are discussed in the methods section.

we first calculated these features, and their distribution ranges are presented in table  <dig>  after checking the value distribution for each feature, we found that extreme values existed; this required us to widen our criteria, which undoubtedly resulted in an increased number of false positive candidates. therefore, we narrowed the distribution ranges into reference values and adopted these values as criteria for the sequence & structural features filter. as shown in table  <dig>  the coverage information shows that, even if we excluded these extreme values, the majority of pre-mirnas still satisfied the selected reference range values. in summary, a candidate for which the gc content, core mfe, hairpin mfe and ch_ratio values were within the individual reference range values was regarded as a positive candidate. such a combination of criteria resulted in  <dig> %  sensitivity. in brief,  <dig>  candidates predicted from the est and  <dig>  candidates predicted from intronic sequence dataset that survived this filter were further processed by refseq filter and conservation examination to find the evolutionarily conserved candidates.

refseq filter
candidates originating from singleton ests, which were without any overlapping with other ests, were also processed using the refseq filter. we downloaded the human refseq sequences  <cit>  with nm accession numbers and used the candidate hairpins to blast search against these protein-coding sequences. candidates matching protein-coding sequences were removed based on the est assembly criterion established by the institute for genomic research , in which the matching sequence was at least  <dig> nt in length and had at least 94% identity to be considered part of the identical transcript contig  <cit> . in brief,  <dig>  candidates from the est and  <dig>  candidates from intronic sequence survived this filter.

conservation examination and candidates in the human, mouse, dog and rat  dataset
mirnas have been conserved among phylogenetically close species during evolution. following the human pre-mirna discovery pipeline from human ests and introns, we searched putative pre-mirnas against other published mammalian genomic sequences, namely mouse , rat  and dog  downloaded from the university of california at santa cruz  <cit> . we defined a conserved hairpin as follows: either of the putative mirnas of a hairpin, 5p or 3p, has a contiguous ≧ 20-nt fragment that is identical to a subject sequence. both mature mirnas  and pre-mirnas  are highly conserved . after surveying the  <dig> known human pre-mirnas to test the reference filter value of this screening approach, we concluded that the entire hairpin must have at least 90% identity with the subject sequence and that the matched sequence must include the 5p, 3p and terminal loop portions in order to be validated.

using the above criteria, we obtained the human, mouse, dog and rat  conservation dataset, and its members represented conserved candidate hairpins having orthologs in human, mouse, dog and rat. originally, our raw data comprised  <dig>  human est entries and  <dig>  intronic sequences. after applying the final conservation filters, there were  <dig> qualified candidate hairpins in the hmdr set,  <dig> of which were known pre-mirnas, resulting in  <dig> %  sensitivity and  <dig> %  specificity . among the  <dig> qualified candidate hairpins,  <dig> were located in ests and  <dig> were found in intronic sequences. each candidate was assigned a unique id, such as ih <dig> or eh <dig>  in which "ih" and "eh" represent a candidate from an intron or est, respectively.

discovery pipeline authentication and specificity assessment
to learn about the efficiency of the pipeline filters used, we first processed the  <dig> known pre-mirna  using the identical parameters for all procedures in the discovery pipeline. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> % of the known mirnas passed the sequence and structural filter .  <dig> % of the known pre-mirna survival the conservation hmdr examination. not all  <dig> pre-mirnas were present among the input est and intron sequences; because some of the reported mirnas are transcribed by polymerase iii, they will not be represented in the polymerase ii mrna population. originally, there were  <dig> of  <dig> pre-mirnas contained in our input sequence data . after the refseq filter and conservation examination yielded the hmdr set,  <dig> and  <dig> pre-mirnas survived, respectively, implying respective sensitivities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for our pipeline. this authenticated our pipeline for discovering putative pre-mirna candidates from the original polymerase ii transcripts .

we used two different approaches to assess the prediction specificity for our pipeline. first, we used the updated mirna registry dataset  <cit>  containing  <dig> known human pre-mirna records. we extracted the  <dig> newly added pre-mirna sequences as our validation test dataset, excluding the  <dig> pre-mirnas in the release  <dig> dataset and some redundant entries. using the  <dig> new pre-mirnas as input query sequence data, we initially detected  <dig> of the  <dig> input pre-mirnas after the initial hairpin finding procedure. we calculated the distributions of quantifiable features, namely gc content, core mfe, hairpin mfe and the ratio of core mfe to hairpin mfe, using the optimized reference values in the discovery pipeline . this strategy led to the survival of  <dig> pre-mirna entry records. in summary, a sensitivity of  <dig> %  was obtained with the newly added  <dig> pre-mirnas in the registry, and this number is similar to the  <dig> % listed in table  <dig> using the training  <dig> pre-mirna dataset .

the second approach used to assess the pipeline was to use large numbers of randomly selected dna sequence fragments as negative entries and the  <dig> known pre-mirnas  as positive answers. the validation dataset generation procedure is similar to the one described by sewer et al.  <cit> . this procedure is based on the fact that the fraction of mirna-encoding sequences in the human genome is very small; therefore, randomly extracted sequences are extremely unlikely to code for mirna. in this test, we randomly extracted  <dig>  sequence fragments  from intronic sequences , ests  and genomic sequences . the  <dig> known pre-mirna sequences and the  <dig>   <dig> random sequences of  <dig> mbps were applied to our discovery pipeline under the same hairpin finding parameters, sequence and structural filter and conservation examination between four genomes. of the  <dig> known pre-mirnas,  <dig> survived the discovery pipeline; this serves as a true positive prediction value. as expected, the number of predicted qualified hairpin candidates from the randomly selected sequences was very small. we obtained  <dig> total false positives in three independent experiments , corresponding to an average of  <dig>  false positives in  <dig> mbps. thus, because the initial input est and intronic sequences are about  <dig>  mbps in length , we could theoretically generate  <dig> false positive candidates from similar size dataset. the specificity value of  <dig> % was obtained by calculating the percentage ratio of  <dig> / +  <dig> ) where tp denotes true positives and fp denotes false positives. however, the performance of the discovery pipeline is likely to be better than this value indicates because of the high stringent criteria used in the conservation examination in four genomes, which would reduce the number of randomly generated hairpin sequences.

expression levels of candidate mirnas
gene indices developed by tigr were created by assembling ests into virtual transcripts, which were named tentative consensus  records. for the candidates derived from ests, the number of ests assembled into the host tc records was proportional to the expression level and was therefore used to represent it. of course, the expression level of each candidate from a singleton est was assigned as  <dig>  finally, for candidates derived from introns, we queried the number of ests assembled into the unigene record  <cit> , in which their host genes are clustered. these numbers were used to represent the expression levels of these candidates.

information for some candidates, including host gene, sequence, genomic location, expression level and so on, is shown in figure 3a; information for all candidates is available at . the candidates derived from ests should be mapped back to the genome and processed to alleviate the redundancy problem .

using conserved motifs as a bridge to find target genes
mirnas function as downregulators of genes, and thus a candidate predicted to have target genes has a higher likelihood of being an authentic mirna. therefore, we searched for possible target genes of the  <dig> mirna candidates in the hmdr set using rnahybrid  <cit>  and by comparison with conserved motifs  <cit> .

because mirnas have been highly conserved in evolution, similar conservation is expected of their targets. mirnas bind their target sites based on perfect or near-perfect sequence complementarity. such pairing patterns constrain the variation of mirnas and their corresponding target sites. xie and colleagues  <cit>  searched for target sites recognized by mirnas and compiled  <dig> conserved and frequent 8-mer motifs by surveying 3' utrs from human, mouse, rat and dog. we downloaded the  <dig> conserved motifs and used them to screen our  <dig> candidate mirnas . we marked a candidate and its corresponding motif as related pairs when the candidate had a contiguous ≧ 6-bp match with a motif.

next, we identified the 3' utrs carrying these motifs. from the human reference gene transcript sequence file  <cit> , we retrieved the sequences of 3' utrs based on the coding sequence positions acquired from the human reference gene genome position file  <cit> . we then used these conserved motifs to compare to the 3' utrs and noted the motifs and their hosting 3' utrs in pairs. using the motifs as bridges, we further used rnahybrid program to align the candidates with the 3' utrs in pairs, where the target 3' utrs carried the same motifs matched by the query candidates.

using rnahybrid to find target sites in 3' utrs
krek et al. used the rnahybrid program to identify mirna target genes  <cit> . they first calculated the optimal free energy of an mirna when the entire mirna binds to a perfectly complementary target site. then they calculated the rna duplex mfe . we adopted rnahybrid and its prediction parameters; an alignment for which the rna duplex mfe was below 33% of its corresponding optimal free energy was regarded as a positive alignment as defined by krek et al.  <cit> . in addition, based on the conclusion of lewis  <cit> , the seed match rule was also obeyed under the parameter "-f  <dig> ", which enforced the criterion that the pairing pattern within the seed must be perfectly matched. due to our strategy that inferred putative mirnas, we could not precisely locate the seed within the putative mirna. therefore, we adopted an alternative seed match policy, in which a candidate meeting the demand of either "-f  <dig> ", "-f  <dig> ", "-f  <dig> ", "-f  <dig> " or "-f  <dig> " was considered. moreover, the matched fragment had to include a conserved motif rather than a random match. in total, we identified  <dig> potential targets in all five parameters. there is only a slight difference in the number of targets predicted in each set:  <dig> targets ,  <dig> targets ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the combined predicted targets were almost overlapping in all five sets, indicating that the prediction sensitivity was not affected by the 2-nt shift permitted at the hairpin ends. this might be attributable to the  <dig> conserved motifs that were used as the bridge for target prediction and to the fact that the prediction was confined within these highly conserved motifs.

ultimately, there were  <dig> candidates existed in the hmdr_target set, in which the candidates were from the hmdr set and were predicted to have specific human target genes . among them,  <dig> were known pre-mirnas. complete information for ih <dig> and a partial list of its target genes is presented in figure 3b, as an example; information on all other human pre-mirna candidates and their target genes is available at . as shown in figure 3c, from the "go information" column, users can access the go information of ih788's host gene, nm_ <dig>  and target gene, nm_ <dig>  in pairs. with this information, we hope to facilitate the study of the interaction between the host gene and target gene at the protein level.

in addition to the human pre-mirna target genes predicted from human ests, we retrieved the sequences of 3' utrs of mouse and rat genes from the mouse reference gene transcript sequences and rat reference gene transcript sequences  <cit> . because these putative pre-mirna candidates are conserved in mouse and rat, we also searched for their target genes in mouse and rat reference genes using the same procedures, and the results can be accessed at . in table  <dig>  hmdr_target represents the pre-mirna candidates found in the hmdr set and also found to have human target genes. hmdr_target represents the pre-mirna candidates found in hmdr set and also found to have mouse target genes. hmdr_target represents the pre-mirna candidates found in hmdr set and also found to have rat target genes. the identical numbers indicating the highly conserved nature of mirna and it targets.

verifying the conservation of target genes in mammals
because our candidate mirnas were conserved among human, mouse and rat, we investigated whether the corresponding target genes that were recognized according to sequence complementarity were also conserved in these species. from ensembl biomart <cit> , we first downloaded the reference tables in which the mouse or rat orthologs of human genes are recorded in pairs. using the reference tables as bridges, we fetched the target genes in human one by one, and we verified whether the mouse or rat orthologs also corresponded to the candidate pre-mirnas.

according to our results , there were  <dig> candidates in the hmdr_target set, in which the candidates were from the hmdr set and their target genes in human and mouse were orthologous genes. among them,  <dig> were known pre-mirnas. partial orthologous target gene pairs of ih <dig> are presented in figure 3d, and information for all other pre-mirnas is available at . moreover, the results for human and rat orthologs are available in table  <dig> and . to our knowledge, this is the first report that examines mirna target genes in orthologous pairs in addition to their host gene conservation.

discussion
advantages and disadvantages of using intronic and est sequences as raw data
our raw data consisted of ests and introns rather than genomic sequences. this strategy has some advantages. for instance, other studies have predicted mirnas using genomic sequences, but it was difficult to confirm their expression. by contrast, most of the ests and introns we studied are well annotated, making it easy to acquire information associated with their expression patterns and levels. for example, bx <dig> and cf <dig>  host ests containing predicted mirnas, are expressed in fetal brain and ovary, respectively. thus, to experimentally confirm these two predicted candidate mirnas, rna can be extracted from fetal brain and ovary  rather than from randomly selected tissue types or cell lines.

the disadvantage of this strategy is that the coverage is reduced when ests and introns, rather than genomic sequences, are used as raw data. theoretically, all of the  <dig> known pre-mirnas should have matches when searching against the human genome; in our data, however, only  <dig> and  <dig> pre-mirnas matched to introns and ests, respectively, implying only  <dig> %  coverage.

procedural differences from previous studies
most pipelines designed to predict mirnas involve procedures that search for evolutionarily conserved candidates. grad et al. claimed that a conserved candidate had a >20-nt match in subject species and that the matched fragments were located in either arm of the hairpin  <cit> . the match of only a single arm, however, may not yield sufficient specificity. besides the mirna-buried stem, the whole hairpin is also highly conserved. in addition, there are many low-complexity fragments in the genome that may fold into complex rna secondary structures, including hairpins. thus, shorter length leads to lower specificity.

in our system, in additon to having conserved mirnas, the precursor hairpins were required to have more than 90% identity with the subject sequence and that the matched hairpin fragment include the 5p, 3p and terminal loop portions. these criteria ensured that our candidates were phylogenetically conserved mirnas rather than low-complexity fragments. our data demonstrate that shorter known hairpins and longer raw sequences produce excellent results that offer an improvement over previous studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed our scanning method using criteria based on the features of  <dig> known pre-mirnas to predict mirnas from expressed sequences . the statistics demonstrate that our pipeline affords good sensitivity but excellent specificity compared with other published works. in addition to predicting pre-mirna hairpins, we searched for their target genes in human, mouse and rat. overall, our results indicate that both the host genes that carry the same putative mirnas and the target genes recognized by the same mirnas, are evolutionarily conserved. finally, we also supply a user-friendly interface to study mirnas as well as their physiological functions.
