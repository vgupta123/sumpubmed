BACKGROUND
mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose function and total number must be responsive to the energy demand of the cell. when cellular energy demand is high, expression of genes encoding mitochondrial factors must be up-regulated. although the mitochondrial genome encodes components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, the majority of the proteins required for mitochondrial biogenesis and function are encoded by the nuclear genome. while a number of transcription factors, including nrf <dig>  nrf <dig>  pparα and pparγ, are required for activation of many nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, little has been reported regarding repression of these same genes  <cit> .

mitochondria contain three important classes of proteins encoded by nuclear genes  <cit> . the first class includes the catalytic and auxiliary proteins of the numerous enzyme systems. these include enzyme systems involved in fatty acid oxidation, the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and the removal of reactive oxygen species . a second class of mitochondrial proteins includes components required for protein import of mitochondrial factors into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, the inner membrane, and the mitochondrial matrix. the third class is comprised of the enzymes and additional proteins required for replication and translation of the mitochondrial genome which are thus required for mitochondrial biogenesis. subsets of mitochondrial genes have been shown to increase or decrease in expression under a variety of tested conditions, suggesting that these groups of genes are co-regulated  <cit> . we previously determined that many nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes are subject to regulation by the sin <dig> transcriptional corepressor  <cit> . elimination of sin <dig> in drosophila s <dig> tissue culture cells by rna interference  led to an increase in the expression of a substantial number of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in all three classes  <cit> . the sin3-deficient cells were also found to have an increase in mitochondrial mass.

although drosophila sin <dig> is required for viability during both embryonic and larval stages of development, the exact nature of the essential requirement for sin <dig> is not understood  <cit> . sin <dig> is a component of the sin <dig> histone deacetylase complex, required for general repression of transcription  <cit> . rpd <dig> is the catalytic component of the sin <dig> complex  <cit> . similar to sin <dig>  loss of drosophila rpd <dig> leads to loss of viability as well as alterations in mitochondrial function and gene activity  <cit> . loss of either sin <dig> or rpd <dig> causes an increase in mitochondrial citrate synthase activity, indicating that mitochondrial oxidative capacity is affected following decreased expression of key sin <dig> complex components  <cit> .

given the finding that the sin <dig> corepressor affects expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, we decided to further investigate the relationship between sin <dig> and mitochondrial gene activity and function. we find that similar to the increase in expression of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, we see an increase in expression of genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome. this elevation is due to increased transcription as the number of mitochondrial dna genomes is unchanged in the sin3-deficient cells. additionally, we find that the increased expression of genes encoding proteins with mitochondrial function is accompanied by an alteration in atp levels. these results suggest that the changes in gene expression give rise to altered mitochondrial function. in support of these findings yeast sin <dig> null mutants grow very poorly on media containing only non-fermentable carbon sources. the sin <dig> null strain also exhibits lowered levels of atp and respiration rates relative to wild type. the data implicate sin <dig> as having a role in the control of cellular energy production.

RESULTS
sin <dig> regulates genes involved in mitochondrial physiology
previously published research from one of the authors  revealed that reduction of sin <dig> by rnai results in up-regulation of numerous genes involved in multiple aspects of mitochondrial biology, including activity and biogenesis  <cit> . using rnai methodology in cultured drosophila cells, we have a tractable system that enables us to induce a group of co-regulated genes by loss of the corepressor sin <dig>  this system allows us to monitor and compare molecular events that occur before and after induction of the different classes of mitochondrial genes including those of the enzyme systems, protein import, and biogenesis. because sin <dig> regulates many genes, we selected a representative set for analysis . genes encoding each mitochondrial protein class are represented in the up-regulated genes. we chose at least one gene from each class. a number of genes encoding proteins involved in the numerous enzyme systems were selected. we are thus able to compare the regulation of genes within and between distinct mitochondrial processes. we chose genes encoding proteins of the individual energy pathways of the enzyme systems including fatty acid oxidation, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and the removal of ros. expression of genes encoding proteins involved in glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm, but produces pyruvate used in mitochondria were also analyzed. a number of the selected genes are known to be regulated by trans-factors that have a putative link to either sin <dig> or histone deacetylation. for example, mrpl <dig>  eftum, ferrochelatase, and tim <dig> were all shown to be bound by one or more members of the max family network of transcription factors  <cit> . repression by the max family member mad is mediated through interactions with sin <dig>  <cit> . gapdh <dig> and pyruvate kinase are glycolytic genes regulated in part by hif- <dig>  <cit> . hif- <dig> associates with fih- <dig> which mediates repression of hif- <dig> through interaction with hdac- <dig>  <cit> . cytochrome c  and phgpx are regulated in part by sp <dig> that has been shown to interact with sin <dig>  <cit> . thiolase and acyl carnitine transporter  have been found to be regulated by pparα  <cit> . multiple pparα-regulated genes are induced by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors  <cit> . thioredoxin reductase is also activated following inhibition of histone deacetylation  <cit> .

to extend the previously published microarray data and to determine the relative difference in expression, we analyzed gene expression by quantitative rt-pcr analysis. to ensure that the changes in gene expression were due to loss of sin <dig> and not the result of an off target effect  <cit> , we generated double stranded rna  against two different regions of the sin <dig> gene. the amount of sin <dig> knockdown was monitored by western blot analysis of whole protein extracts prepared from the cells. sin <dig> expression was reduced to similar levels in cells incubated with dsrna targeting the two different sequences of the sin <dig> mrna . cdna made from rna isolated from each of the cell populations, control, sin3-deficient  <dig> , and sin3-deficient  <dig> , was analyzed by a quantitative real-time pcr  assay. the fold change in expression of the selected genes is given in figure 1b. the majority of the genes selected  were previously identified as sin <dig> targets by microarray analysis of rnai-induced sin3-deficient cells  <cit> . we also included two genes, phosphoglycerate kinase and aldolase, which did not show a change in expression by the microarray analysis, as well as two genes, microsomal glutathione transferase  <dig>  and cg <dig> , that showed down-regulation in the microarray study. the increases in gene expression following loss of sin <dig> using the same dsrna  as in the microrarray experiment ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold, consistent with the microarray data  <cit> . use of dsrna targeting a distinct sequence of sin <dig>  also resulted in up-regulation of the majority of genes tested, although for some of these, the amount of increase was less than  <dig>  fold. cg <dig> , one of the two down-regulated genes tested, showed a decrease following sin <dig> knockdown using either of the dsrnas. the other gene, mgst <dig>  that by microarray was found to be down-regulated, showed essentially no change in expression as measured by qpcr. the phosphoglycerate kinase and aldolase genes had similar levels of expression in the control and sin3-deficient cells, consistent with the microarray data. the results of this qpcr experiment confirm our previous findings that loss of sin <dig> results in the coordinated up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in multiple mitochondrial functions. we saw similar patterns of changes in gene expression with either of the sin <dig> targeting dsrnas, indicating that the observed effects are likely due to loss of sin <dig> and are not the result of an off target effect.

mitochondrial encoded genes are up-regulated following loss of sin3
because loss of sin <dig> resulted in increased expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, we next examined expression of genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome in sin3-deficient cells. we assayed rna levels using qpcr analysis with primers designed to individually amplify four distinct mitochondrial encoded genes. cdna made from rna isolated from control and sin3-deficient s <dig> cells was used as template for qpcr. loss of sin <dig> resulted in increased expression of the four mitochondrial genes tested, mt: atpase <dig>  mt: coi, mt: cyt-b and mt: nd <dig> . interestingly, the increase in expression of the mitochondrial encoded genes in the sin3-deficient cells was very similar to the level of increase in expression of the nuclear encoded genes. the changes were in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold. mitochondrial encoded genes are regulated by transcription factors that are encoded by the nuclear genome. we determined whether nuclear encoded transcription factors, including tfam, tfb <dig>  tfb <dig>  mitochondrial rna polymerase  and transcription termination factor dmttf, showed a change in expression following loss of sin <dig>  while the majority of the factors did not show a significant increase in expression in the sin3-deficient cells, mtrna-pol was up-regulated  <dig>  fold relative to control cells . taken together, the data suggest that the increase in the levels of the tested mitochondrial transcripts is possibly due to an increase in the level of mtrna-pol. the finding that the increases in expression of the nuclear and mitochondrial encoded genes are all in the same range is consistent with numerous reports outlining cross-talk between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> .

the up-regulation of mitochondrial ribosomal and translation elongation proteins suggests that mitochondrial biogenesis is increased in sin3-deficient cells. in addition, sin3-deficient cells have more mitochondrial mass compared to control cells  <cit> . given these findings, we decided to determine the relative mitochondrial dna copy number in control and sin3-deficient cells. dna extracted from each of the samples was subjected to qpcr analysis using primer pairs specific for mitochondrial dna. as a control, we also determined the relative levels of two nuclear encoded genes. based on relative levels of four mitochondrial genes, we found that mitochondrial dna copy number was unchanged following loss of sin <dig> . the finding that the transcripts of these mitochondrial encoded genes are increased while mitochondrial genome copy number is unchanged suggests that, in sin3-deficient cells, there is an increase in the amount of mitochondrial gene transcription from the equivalent number of genomes rather than similar levels of transcription from an increased number of mitochondrial genomic templates.

mitochondrial function is altered in sin3-deficient cells
following loss of sin <dig>  the expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding proteins important for glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation is increased . glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation produce nadh and fadh <dig> that feed into oxidative phosphorylation resulting in atp production. since transcription of mitochondrial encoded genes can be correlated with atp levels  <cit>  we asked whether atp levels are increased in sin3-deficient cells. the relative amount of atp present in extracts from control and sin3-deficient s <dig> cells was determined. we found that while atp levels were elevated in sin3-deficient cells relative to the control samples, the increase was not statistically significant . proliferating cells grown in culture often rely more heavily upon glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for atp production  <cit> . in some tissue culture cell lines, oxidative phosphorylation has been shown to be inhibited by excess glucose  <cit> . in an effort to promote oxidative phosphorylation in drosophila s <dig> cells, we grew the cells in media diluted 1: <dig> with pbs  for  <dig> hours prior to the atp assay. under these conditions, sin3-deficient cells exhibited a decrease in atp levels relative to the control cells . these data suggest that when cells are cultured under conditions that favor atp generation by oxidative phosphorylation rather than by glycolysis, loss of sin <dig> results in lowered atp production compared to that in wild type cells.

we also monitored respiration rate in the sin3-deficient cells relative to controls. grown under normal culture conditions, we observed little change in respiration using one dsrna target sequence and an increase using the other sequence . in the depleted condition, consistent with the lowered atp levels, both sets of sin3-depleted cells had lower respiration rates compared to control cells . taken together, the atp and respiration data suggest that loss of sin <dig> leads to changes in gene transcription that affects mitochondrial function.

yeast sin <dig> mutants exhibit defects in atp production and respiration
unlike in drosophila, saccharomyces cerevisiae sin <dig> is not an essential gene  <cit> . gene expression profiles of null mutants revealed that yeast sin <dig>  regulates genes involved in carbon metabolism  <cit> . we hypothesized that as ysin <dig> regulates expression of genes encoding proteins that function in the mitochondria, the sin <dig> mutant may display altered ability to grow in media prepared with non-fermentable carbon sources. to test our hypothesis, we monitored the growth rates of wild type and sin <dig> mutant cells in glucose-containing fermentable media  and in non-fermentable media. glucose is the preferred carbon source for yeast, which produce atp through glycolysis and fermentation. in the absence of glucose and in the presence of other carbon sources, including glycerol and ethanol, atp production can only occur through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation requiring functional mitochondria  <cit> . the sin <dig> mutant displayed a slightly delayed growth phenotype when cultured in ypd . this growth defect is possibly due to a cell cycle delay in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. sin <dig> was recently found to be important for cell cycle progression as the percentage of cells in g <dig> phase was elevated in the null mutant relative to the control strain  <cit> . in striking contrast to the data obtained on glucose-containing media, the sin <dig> mutant grew very poorly in each of the non-fermentable media tested .

as sin <dig> was not previously identified in global screens for factors required for respiratory activity  <cit> , we wished to verify our findings using a sin <dig> mutant having a different genetic background. two additional independent sin <dig> mutants grew very poorly on non-fermentable carbon sources as compared to their wild type counterpart strains . very poor growth of the mutants was also noted when the strains were spread onto solid agar plates containing the respective carbon sources  given the poor growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, it is important to verify that the sin <dig> mutant strains are not petite. to verify that the strains contain mitochondrial dna, the cells were stained with dapi. mitochondrial genomes were observed in all mutants indicating the defective growth on non-fermentable carbon is not due to the strains becoming rhoo .

we also tested whether a deletion in yrpd <dig>  the catalytic component of the sin <dig> histone deacetyase complex, would affect growth in non-fermentable carbon. like sin <dig>  rpd <dig> is a non-essential gene  <cit> . as expected, we determined that yrpd <dig> was dispensable for growth in glucose-containing ypd . similar to the sin <dig> mutants, the rpd <dig> mutant grew very poorly in liquid media and on solid agar plates containing non-fermentable carbon sources . staining of mitochondrial dna in the rpd <dig> mutant verified that the strain was not rhoo . taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that yeast sin <dig> and rpd <dig> are critical for mitochondrial function.

to further analyze the yeast sin <dig> mutant for mitochondrial activity, we monitored atp levels and respiration rates in wild type and sin <dig> strains. we performed these assays using cells grown in glucose and non-fermentable media. samples were collected from cells in both log and stationary phases of growth. during log phase, yeast produce atp primarily through fermentation. as glucose in the media becomes exhausted, cells become adapted to mitochondrial respiration, a metabolic process known as the diauxic shift  <cit> . the respiration rate of wild type cells isolated in stationary phase was higher relative to the rate in cells that were still in the log phase of growth, indicating the switch to aerobic respiration seen in the diauxic shift . in all media and in both phases of growth, the sin <dig> null mutant showed lower levels of atp . consistent with the lowered levels of atp, the respiration rates were also decreased in the sin <dig> mutants relative to wild type cells . the findings that yeast sin <dig> mutants are unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources and show lowered atp and reduced oxygen consumption indicate that ysin <dig> is important for mitochondrial function. the observations that both yeast and drosophila sin <dig> affect mitochondrial activity imply an evolutionarily conserved role for sin <dig> in the control of cellular energy production.

discussion
we previously established that the expression of numerous nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes was up-regulated in drosophila tissue culture cells following the loss of the corepressor sin <dig>  <cit> . in research described in this current work, we first determined that the changes in gene expression following loss of sin <dig> are unlikely due to off target effects of sin <dig> rnai. targeting two different regions of the sin <dig> mrna results in similar changes in gene expression, indicating that the changes are likely due to loss of sin <dig> and not to an effect of another gene that contains a short similar sequence. in addition to the changes in expression of the nuclear encoded genes, loss of sin <dig> results in an up-regulation of mitochondrial encoded genes. although we observe changes in gene expression, we find that mitochondrial genome copy number is unaltered. the changes in gene expression prompted us to examine mitochondrial function in sin3-deficient cells. sin3-deficient cells show changes in atp levels and respiration rates, suggesting that the increases in gene expression result in altered oxidative phosphorylation capacity. a necessary role of sin <dig> for normal mitochondrial function is supported by the finding that yeast sin <dig> mutants are unable to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, conditions which require active mitochondria for atp production.

consistent with numerous published reports, we have determined that loss of ysin <dig> is dispensable for fermentative growth  <cit> . in contrast, ysin <dig> is critical for growth when respiration is required . genome wide studies have been conducted to identify yeast mutant strains that have the ability to grow on ypd and exhibit reduced growth on non-fermentable carbon sources but failed to identify sin <dig>  <cit> . several possible explanations may account for false negatives in global screens, three of which are discussed by the authors of one of the global screen studies  <cit> . first, methods of analysis for growth and scoring differ. second, there may be phenotypic plasticity between mutants in different strain backgrounds. third, the yeast deletion collections are known to accumulate errors, and it is well-established that deletion strains must first be tested to ensure that the deletion is correct. obviously, this cannot be done when carrying out global screens. in addition, in the global study of steinmetz et al.  <cit> , the sin <dig> mutant did not grow well when cultured in any of the different carbon sources under the assay conditions tested, including ypd. pools of mutants were cultured in various media and growth of individual mutant strains of the pool was compared to average growth in the culture. it is possible that the sin <dig> strain was not able to grow in any of the assay conditions in such pools of mutants. all of the above are potential reasons as to why sin <dig> was not identified in a global screen for genes required for respiratory activity. in this study we demonstrate that, when assayed as an individual strain, the sin <dig> mutant grows very poorly in non-fermentable media, indicating that ysin <dig> is required when cells are forced to respire. consistent with this data, sin <dig> mutants have lower levels of atp and decreased respiration rates.

work from multiple laboratories has indicated that there are many similarities between yeast and metazoan sin <dig>  including the fact that sin <dig> acts as a global regulator of transcription and that it functions in the context of the sin <dig> histone deactylase complex  <cit> . one major reported difference between yeast and metazoan sin <dig> is the requirement of this gene for viability. ysin <dig> is dispensable for growth while metazoan sin <dig> is an essential gene  <cit> . analysis of conditional knockdown of drosophila sin <dig> mutants suggests that sin3-deficiency leads to death due to defects in cell cycle progression rather than due to alteration of a specific developmental pathway  <cit> . in this work, we have found that ysin <dig> is required for cell growth when mitochondrial function is necessary for atp production. it is thus possible that, rather than being essential for some specific process of development, the metazoan requirement for sin <dig> is due to its requirement for normal mitochondrial activity. we hypothesize that loss of sin <dig> leads to a defect in mitochondrial function that in turn leads to a defect in cell cycle progression. links between cell cycle control and mitochondrial activity are well established. myc: max heterodimers positively regulate the cell cycle while rb-e2f complexes repress genes necessary for cell cycle progression  <cit> . both sets of factors have been linked to regulation by nrf- <dig>  a key transcription activator of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes  <cit> . sin <dig> has been linked to both the max transcription network and to regulation by rb, supporting the hypothesis that sin <dig> regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and activity is linked to cell cycle control  <cit> . it was recently shown in mammalian cells that changes in mitochondrial morphology are crucial for cell cycle control. at the g1-s checkpoint mitochondria are organized as a large fused network with higher mitochondrial membrane potentials, increased atp levels and increased respiration rates, whereas in other stages of the cell cycle, mitochondria are predominantly in the fission state  <cit> . lower atp levels and respiration rates caused by sin <dig> knockdown  may thus interfere with cell cycle progression at the g1-s transition.

in addition to its role in gene regulation, sin <dig> might directly regulate energy metabolism as a participant in cell signaling. there is clear evidence that signaling pathways regulate mitochondrial respiration and energy levels, e.g., the camp and inflammatory pathways lead to phosphorylation of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, followed by changes in respiration and atp levels  <cit> . sin <dig> might exert a stimulatory signal required for normal mitochondrial function. the observation that reduction in sin <dig> results in decreased atp levels and respiration is perhaps surprising in light of the finding that expression of many genes encoding proteins with mitochondrial function are up-regulated. up-regulation of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes upon sin <dig> knockdown may therefore be a compensatory response to an increase in the mitochondrial component due to dysfunctional energy metabolism, as is seen when yeast must adapt to mitochondrial respiration in full dependence on glycolysis . alternatively, mis-coordination of mitochondrial gene expression in the sin3-deficient cells may result in the observed altered mitochondrial function because loss of sin <dig> leads to an increase in expression of many but not all genes involved in mitochondrial processes  <cit> . as has been previously suggested, an imbalance in the level of the proteins present in complexes important for energy production may result in mitochondrial malfunction  <cit> . finally, key links between regulation of acetylation and metabolism are highlighted in recently published data indicating that atp-citrate lyase is important for maintenance of histone acetylation levels in growing cells  <cit> . it is possible that sin <dig> knockdown affects acetylation resulting not only in changes in gene expression but also altered pools of key metabolites and an inappropriate response of the mitochondria to these abnormal signals. it will be of interest to further investigate the relationship between histone acetylation and mitochondrial function to better understand control of cellular metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, mitochondrial activity was affected following loss of sin <dig> in both drosophila cultured cells and in yeast. this abnormal mitochondrial function may lead to cell cycle defects and thus affect cell and organism viability.
