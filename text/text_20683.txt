BACKGROUND
high-throughput technologies have been shown to play an increasingly important role in clinical research and diagnostics . in whole genome sequencing data various causative variants for disease traits have been detected in human as well as other mammals including cattle, horse and dogs . it has been shown that disease causing mutations can be breed or population specific and are often linked or promoted by characteristic features or phenotypic traits supported in breeding programs  <cit> . in shar-pei dogs, the development of a characteristically strongly wrinkled skin stabilized by deposits of hyaluronic acid were suggested to be involved in inflammatory processes resulting in a periodic fever  <cit> . it was proposed that a  <dig>  kb duplication upstream of the hyaluronan synthase  <dig>  on chromosome   <dig>  which was detected in shar-pei with a padded muzzle , was associated with skin wrinkling and periodic fever in shar-pei dogs  <cit> . therefore, this variant was assumed to affect both fever and thick and folded skin  <cit> . however, a direct relation of specific copy numbers detected by real-time pcr to shar-pei fever as an individual phenotype with no regard to other inflammatory signs could not be confirmed  <cit> . further investigations of affected shar-pei showed that clinical manifestation was much more variable and recurrent bouts of fever were only one of various clinical signs designated now as a syndrome termed shar-pei autoinflammatory disease   <cit> . additional signs of inflammation could be shown to be arthritis, dermatitis, otitis and systemic amyloidosis  <cit> . it was proposed that genetic risk factors on cfa <dig> and cfa <dig> might trigger these inflammatory processes  <cit> . further droplet digital pcr  analysis of the  <dig>  kb copy number variation  upstream of has <dig> revealed stable cnv alleles in this region in contrast to continuous alleles previously detected by real-time pcr and subsequently suggested an association with spaid  <cit> . this breed specific cnv was suggested to be inherited in a bi-allelic way and proposed to explain  <dig> % of the genetic variance whereas the influence of further potential causative variants and triggers for spaid were still unclear  <cit> . the complexity of the disease and the variable onset of signs of inflammation showed a high similarity to human autoinflammatory diseases like the familial mediterranean fever  <cit> . various genes have been shown to be involved in human autoinflammatory processes and were also found to interact with each other in triggering recurrent episodes of inflammation .

in our study, we investigated genetic variants derived from next generation sequencing  data to identify potential causative mutations which might be involved in the development of autoinflammatory processes and thus play a significant role in triggering spaid in shar-pei.

RESULTS
phenotype
clinical investigations and patient histories recorded by a questionnaire resulted in  <dig> shar-pei with clinical signs consistent with spaid and  <dig> unaffected dogs. the study included shar-pei of different breed types including horse, brush and bear coats, modern types with a meatmouth and traditional types with a bonemouth as well as shar-pei with a strongly wrinkled skin and others with few wrinkles . in total,  <dig> of the spaid-affected and  <dig> spaid-unaffected shar-pei were older than six years and were therefore considered to be a reliable set for the spaid-phenotype. first signs of the disease could be observed in a range of one to twelve years in the individual dogs whereas the average onset of the disease was  <dig>  years . only three shar-pei developed first signs of inflammation at an age of older than six years. specific investigations of spaid signs revealed all combinations of the inflammatory types fever, arthritis, erythema, thickened and pasty skin, otitis, eye inflammation and recurrent intestinal inflammations .table  <dig> phenotypes of  <dig> shar-pei investigated for spaid

histopathologic examination
due to bad general condition and poor prognosis two severely spaid-affected shar-pei were euthanized and underwent histopathological examination. in addition, an spaid-unaffected dog with no signs of inflammation was used as control. that dog was euthanized because of poor prognosis due to metastasizing tumors. in both spaid-affected dogs, the skin revealed a perivascular and diffuse dermatitis with lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophilic granulocytes and mast cells . in addition, one spaid-case revealed a multifocal accumulation of amyloid in the salivary gland, liver, pancreas, kidneys , adrenal glands, thyroid glands, spleen and in the lamina propria mucosae of stomach, small and large intestine. in all three examined shar-pei a generalized cutaneous mucinosis was present .fig.  <dig> inflammatory processes in the skin. perivascular and diffuse infiltration with lymphocytes , plasma cells , eosinophilc granulocytes  and mast cells  in the skin of a spaid-affected shar-pei . normal skin of a spaid-unaffected shar-pei . he, magnification 400x

whole genome sequencing
the whole genome of the two severely spaid-affected shar-pei with recurrent bouts of fever and acute joint inflammations confirmed by careful examination of an accredited veterinarian was sequenced in order to compare genetic variants for an association with spaid using data from five reference dogs of different breeds from sequence read achieve . due to the high incidence of spaid-affected progeny and parents, these two investigated shar-pei were expected to be very likely homozygous carriers of a potential causative mutation for spaid. whole genome sequencing resulted in a coverage of 11x  and 12x shar-pei  <dig> . in total,  <dig> missense variants, two disruptive in-frame insertions and deletions, one noncoding transcript exon variant, two frameshift variants and one splice acceptor variant could be detected in filtering analysis for homozygous mutant genotypes exclusively present in spaid-affected shar-pei . six snvs that were predicted to be deleterious  as well as probably damaging  and three insertions/deletions  were chosen for further investigation of their association with spaid .table  <dig> results from filtering analysis for spaid-associated genotypes

in total  <dig> variants with predicted high or moderate effects  could be exclusively found homozygous for the mutant allele in spaid-affected shar-pei. sift and polyphen- <dig> variant effect estimations are shown for each position


spaid-associated variants with predicted high or moderate effects  were genotyped for  <dig> spaid-affected and  <dig> spaid-unaffected shar-pei




validation of genetic variants
validation of all nine potentially deleterious genetic variants detected in whole genome sequencing data in  <dig> spaid-affected and  <dig> spaid-unaffected shar-pei using kompetitive allele specific pcr  and gel electrophoresis revealed a borderline significant p-value for tgfbr3:g.57204844a > g located in tgfbr <dig> , but a highly significant p-value for mtbp:g.19383758g > a  located in mtbp . further validation of all nine variants in  <dig> dogs of  <dig> different breeds showed that none of the variants could be found in any other tested dog breed . the missense mutation mtbp:g.19383758g > a was predicted to result in a deleterious  as well as probably damaging  substitution of glutamic acid to lysine located in the mdn2-binding protein, c-terminal domain.

genotypic distribution of mtbp:g.19383758g > a in shar-pei of all age groups  revealed none of the investigated spaid-affected shar-pei harboring a homozygous wild type genotype. in total,  <dig> % showed the a/a genotype whereas  <dig> % had a heterozygous genotype . in the validated spaid-unaffected shar-pei we found the g/g genotype in  <dig> %, g/a in  <dig> % and a/a in  <dig> %. further investigation of the genotypes in a subgroup of shar-pei older than six years revealed the disease associated genotype a/a exclusively in spaid-affected dogs as well as the wild type genotype g/g only in spaid-unaffected shar-pei . in  <dig> shar-pei with a heterozygous genotype, 32% were not affected at the date of examination whereas 68% revealed signs of spaid and therefore showed a  <dig> -fold higher risk for disease development. the distribution of genotypes by phenotypes suggested an incomplete dominant mode of inheritance. complex segregation analysis supported this mode of inheritance because a significant difference based on a log-likelihood ratio test  among a model with arbitrary mendelian factors and a model accounting for environmental variation  could be found, whereas other models  did not result in significant differences. with regard to the breed specific types, the modern type with a meatmouth was found to be most frequent among spaid-affected shar-pei  although all three genotypes were detected in meatmouth as well as bonemouth shar-pei.table  <dig> genotypic distribution of spaid-associated missense mutation mtbp:g.19383758g > a

none of the affected shar-pei older than six years showed the wild type genotype g/g whereas none of the unaffected shar-pei of this group harboured the disease associated genotype a/a. regardless of the muzzle type both genotypes g/g or a/a could be found in meatmouth and bonemouth shar-pei types

candidate gene sequencing
sanger sequencing results of mtbp  in one spaid-affected shar-pei and two control dogs confirmed the candidate snv mtbp:g.19383758g > a  in the complementary dna in the affected shar-pei  and the mtbp gene model predicted by ensembl. in addition, we detected four snvs which could not be exclusively found in the affected shar-pei.

expression analysis
to investigate the potential functional effect of mtbp:g.19383758g > a variant on mtbp we studied tp <dig>  mrna expression as a bioindicator for mtbp. mtbp was shown to form a complex with mdm <dig> and thereby stabilizes this protein  <cit> . mdm <dig> is an inhibitor of p <dig>  encoded by tp <dig>  <cit> . thus, mtbp indirectly inhibits p <dig> by stabilizing mdm <dig> in the p53-mdm2-mtbp pathway  <cit> .

quantification of tp <dig> levels performed in skin and hair samples of all three mtbp:g.19383758g > a genotypes g/g, g/a and a/a revealed a significant decrease of relative tp <dig> expression in dogs with a heterozygous genotype  as well as in dogs with a homozygous mutant genotype  in relation to the wild type genotype . in-between g/a and a/a genotypes the differential expression was also significant . it could be observed that relative expression levels of g/a-samples showed the highest variation ranging from low 2-Δct , which could also be found in a/a samples, to higher 2-Δct  found in g/g samples. skin samples showed a similar distribution of relative expression levels and confirmed a significant decrease in g/a and an even higher decrease in a/a samples.fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of tp <dig>  relative expression of tp <dig> and its relation to mtbp:g.19383758g > a genotypes are shown. the ΔΔct method was used to compute expression levels  for skin and hair tissues. compared to samples with a homozygous wild type genotype , the relative expression levels of samples with a heterozygous genotype  or homozygous mutant genotype  were significantly decreased




runs of homozygosity 
analysis for roh regions was performed to investigate homozygosity in the region of mtbp and to identify further potential signatures of selection in the same spaid-affected shar-pei which were studied in whole genome sequencing analysis. in total,  <dig> shared roh regions could be detected in canine high density bead chip data of the two shar-pei, which could not be found in the investigated eight control dogs of different breeds . rohs were identified on cfa <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the largest roh region was found on cfa <dig> at  <dig> ,926- <dig> ,354 bp  including mtbp as well as enpp <dig> , taf <dig> , dscc <dig> , deptor , col14a <dig> , mrpl <dig> , sntb <dig> , syt <dig> , rna5sp <dig>  and seven novel genes. on cfa <dig> only one novel gene  could be identified in the roh region as well as the three genes cnn <dig> , tf  and abcd <dig>  in close proximity to this region.

functional annotation for human orthologue genes detected in all roh regions found exclusively in shar-pei showed a particularly high number of genes involved in cellular processes  and metabolic processes . in pathway analysis an inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signalling pathway  was detected for the gene col14a <dig>  nevertheless, no spaid-associated variant with predicted high or moderate effect could be found in this gene and further candidate genes from roh analysis. further pathways were transcription regulator , metabolic , ubiquitin proteasome  and integrin signalling pathways .

discussion
analysis of ngs data in two spaid-affected shar-pei and further validation revealed mtbp:g.19383758g > a on cfa <dig> to be highly associated with spaid in shar-pei. all  <dig> spaid-affected dogs harbored at least one mutant a-allele of the missense mutation predicted to have a damaging effect. in spaid-unaffected shar-pei  <dig> dogs were found to harbor the homozygous mutant genotype . these dogs were all younger than six years, whereas none of the older dogs showed the a/a genotype. we suppose that due to the variable onset of the disease spaid-unaffected shar-pei with homozygous mutant genotype, which are younger than six years, might still develop signs of the disease. shar-pei at an age of at least seven years with no signs of the disease were proposed to be most likely healthy with regard to spaid  <cit> .

under the assumption of a variable age of onset, the results propose an incomplete dominant mode of inheritance for mtbp:g.19383758g > a. this suggestion was supported by the high incidence of spaid-affected shar-pei as much as by the identification of a large roh region exclusively found in two spaid-affected shar-pei but not in control dogs. roh detection has been shown to be a successful method for the investigation of disease traits as well as other phenotypic traits . long rohs were reported to be frequent in genomic regions harboring genes associated with autosomal-dominant diseases  <cit> . analysis for signatures of selection specific for shar-pei gave evidence for a region on cfa <dig> harboring has <dig>  which was suggested to be associated with breed specific skin wrinkling  <cit> . further genome screening for signatures of selection in  <dig> us-shar-pei detected a potential signature of selective sweeps downstream of has <dig> and revealed further reduction of homozygosity on cfa <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x  <cit> . the results from present roh analysis in two spaid-affected shar-pei genotyped on the canine illumina high density bead chip identified a roh region proximal of the previously detected rohs harboring the candidate gene mtbp. possible reasons for this shift of roh regions might be the differences in marker density and investigated populations  in these studies but might also be the specific testing for spaid-affected shar-pei in our analysis. we assume that the gene locus for a thick and wrinkled skin responsible for the meatmouth shar-pei type might be close to the causative variant for spaid and could explain the assumption that cnv_ <dig>  near has <dig> is related to affected skin formation simultaneously to periodic fever  <cit> . despite the limitation of our analysis due to the low number of tested shar-pei, the detection of a highly spaid-associated variant in mtbp supports this assumption.

the main role of mtbp was shown to be the formation of a stable complex with mdm <dig> by preventing it from autoubiquitination  <cit> . mdm <dig> could be shown to have a pro-inflammatory as well as an epithelial regeneration effect  <cit> . a blockade of mdm <dig> investigated in postischemic kidneys resulted in a suppression of a sterile inflammatory response, an enhanced apoptosis and intrarenal expression of proapoptotic p <dig> target genes  <cit> . a similar suggestion was made for variants in mfev resulting in human mediterranean fever which did not only increase sensitivity for triggers of inflammatory responses but did also play a role in apoptotic processes  <cit> . in addition, mtbp was proposed to promote indirectly the degradation of p <dig> by mdm2-mediated ubiquitination  <cit> . due to this strong relationship in the mtbp-mdm2-p <dig> pathway, tp <dig> mrna was used a bioindicator for mtbp-mdm <dig> activity. it was shown that an increase of mdm <dig> leads to a decrease of p <dig> levels and finally also a decrease of mdm <dig> in a feedback loop  <cit> . in our analysis for spaid we detected this effect as well, showing a decrease of tp <dig> expression in shar-pei with a mutant g/a or a/a genotype due to the p53-inhibitory function of mdm <dig>  for this reason, we assume that a modification in the mdm2-binding domain of mtpb protein in spaid-affected dogs might affect the binding affinity to mdm <dig> and potentially result in a higher complex stability or reduced complex dissociation  <cit>  and consequently increase mdm <dig> activity. due to this functional relation and the distribution of the mutant allele in tested dogs, we assume that the missense mutation mtbp:g.19383758g > a induces proinflammatory effects via mtbp-mdm <dig> pathway in spaid-affected shar-pei.

this variant is located near cnv_ <dig>  which has previously been suggested to increase spaid-risk in shar-pei dogs  <cit> . in our analyses this cnv showed complete linkage with mtbp:g.19383758g > a. nevertheless, it was suggested that cnv_ <dig>  might alter the expression of has <dig> and thereby affect both the development of a meatmouth muzzle type and spaid  <cit> . the distribution of genotypes actually confirmed the high incidence of spaid in meatmouth shar-pei types but also detected spaid-affected bonemouth types. in addition, has <dig> mrna was further shown to be highly expressed in cells of severely folded skin and skin vesicles derived from vesicular hyaluronosis due to an accumulation of hyaluronic acid  <cit> . our pathohistologic examinations showed that both spaid-affected and spaid-unaffected dogs harboured signs of cutaneous mucinosis as a result of hyaluronic acid accumulation. for this reason we propose that hyaluronic acid levels are not related to spaid. thereby, the role of cnv_ <dig>  and the influence of has <dig> on spaid remain unclear. in contrast, mutant mtbp is not related to hyaluronic acid accumulation but to inflammatory and apoptotic processes via mdm <dig> and thus suggests an important role in spaid development. nevertheless, due to the complex nature of inflammatory processes we cannot exclude that further variants might play a role in disease development.

functional analysis of genes detected in potential signatures of selection in spaid-affected shar-pei revealed a high number of genes involved in signaling pathways that might be involved in inflammatory processes. investigations of inflammatory mediators in alveolar epithelial derived from inflamed lungs in mice proposed that especially genes involved in signal transduction were downregulated in cells affected by inflammation  <cit> . particularly col14a1n which could be found to be involved in the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway in our roh region analysis, was also reported to be downregulated in inflamed lung cells in mice  <cit> . the candidate gene deptor was identified as a further proinflammatory gene in this roh region on cfa <dig>  involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell activation and proinflammatory responses  <cit> . in addition, abcd <dig> encoding for a peroxisomeal membrane protein was detected close to a roh region on cfa <dig>  it was shown that abcd <dig> was involved in the protection of cortical neurons from inflammatory mediators  <cit> . although no spaid-associated variants with predicted high or moderate effects could be detected in these genes, it cannot be excluded that further functional variants might affect them and might therefore be involved in the autoinflammatory processes in spaid-affected shar-pei.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, in this study we showed a missense variant in mtbp acting via mdm <dig> for a proinflammatory reaction in spaid-affected shar-pei. these results represent an important advance in the efforts to elucidate genetic mechanisms involved in pre-inflammatory processes in dogs.
