BACKGROUND
the lg/j  and sm/j  strains of inbred mice were independently derived from selection experiments for large and small body size at 60 days, respectively  <cit> . lg/j was created from a pool of albino mice obtained from a commercial breeder over a nine-month period and selected for increased body size for over  <dig> generations  <cit> .

sm/j was created from a pool of mice derived from four crosses of seven inbred strains: dilute brown agouti , silver chocolate , black and tan , pink-eyed, short-eared dilute brown agouti , albino , cinnamon spotted , and agouti   <cit> . it is unclear whether any of these strains are related to current laboratory inbred strains. the sm/j strain is kept heterozygous at the agouti locus by mating black animals  with their white-bellied agouti  siblings. attempts to fix the sm/j strain or its recombinant inbred strain offspring for the sm/j allele at agouti have resulted in strain failure  <cit> .

subsequent to selection, the lg/j and sm/j strains are fully inbred and have been maintained at the jackson laboratory since the 1950s by brother-sister mating. they are at the extremes of the adult body size distribution among the common laboratory inbred strains and have been profitably studied for genetic variation in adult body size and growth  <cit> . early genetic studies of these two strains found the differences in body size are caused by many genes of individually small effects  <cit> . this result has been confirmed in many quantitative trait locus  mapping studies. the strains have remained phenotypically stable over time, except that the sm/j strain is now about 6g heavier than it was in chai’s studies  <cit> .

lg/j and sm/j differ in many complex traits in addition to size and growth. the parental strains and their crosses differ in skeletal morphology, including the size and shape of the skull  <cit> , mandible  <cit> , tooth morphology  <cit> , long-bone lengths  <cit> , and a variety of other skeletal elements as well as bone biomechanical and structural properties  <cit> .

they also differ for a variety of metabolic traits including obesity, diabetes, and serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids levels  <cit> . the sm/j strain responds more strongly than lg/j to a high-fat diet for these metabolic traits. the two strains also differ for maternal genetic effects on offspring growth and offspring adult metabolic traits  <cit>  and their cross has been useful in mapping parent-of-origin genetic effects on metabolic traits  <cit> .

in addition to these diverse metabolic and skeletal phenotypes, the lg/j strain shows the rare ability to regenerate tissues after injury. the lg/j strain regenerates ear pinna tissues after a 2mm hole-punch  <cit>  while the sm/j strain does not. the lg/j strain also can regenerate damaged articular cartilage  <cit>  and is protected from post-traumatic osteoarthritis  <cit> .

others have mapped a variety of behavioral phenotypes using a lg x sm cross, including prepulse inhibition  <cit>  and methamphetamine sensitivity and locomotor activity  <cit> . additional studies have investigated blood cell parameters  <cit>  and skeletal muscle weight and fiber types  <cit> .

here we describe the whole-genome sequences of the lg/j and sm/j inbred mouse strains, adding two more sequences to the collection of whole-genomes of laboratory mice  <cit> . we integrate these sequences with quantitative trait loci , and illustrate how top-down  and bottom-up  approaches can be used to identify candidate quantitative trait genes  and prioritize positional candidate quantitative trait nucleotides  for further mechanistic studies. results from qtl studies using crosses of lg/j and sm/j will be more interpretable given these whole-genome sequences.

RESULTS
lg/j and sm/j whole-genome sequences
sequence was generated from dna isolated from  <dig> lg/j female and  <dig> sm/j female as described below. variants  including single nucleotide polymorphisms  and small insertion-deletions  and structural variants  including deletions, insertions and inversions) were discovered based on whether they were the same as, or different from, the c57bl/6j reference sequence . greater than 90% of reads for each strain could be uniquely mapped to the reference genome and, based on a genome size of  <dig> g, our coverage is approximately 35x and 30x for lg/j and sm/j, respectively. overviews of annotated variants identified for each strain individually, as well as those that are polymorphic between lg/j and sm/j, are described in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  snvs identified for the lg/j strain are available in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> and for the sm/j strain in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  structural variant positions and classifications for each strain are available in additional file  <dig>  polymorphic variants and their genomic context are illustrated in figure  <dig>  quality was assessed by comparing our snp calls with snps in dbsnp that were called from unpublished low-coverage sequence generated independently via two separate library preparations for lg/j  and sm/j  .table  <dig>

we compared snps identified in lg/j and sm/j to those identified in other mouse strains sequenced at high coverage and identified novel variants . pairwise distances were calculated for lg/j and sm/j from each of these strains and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using all  <dig> mouse sequences . the lg/j and sm/j ancestries are expected given what we know about their origins and previous studies of inbred mouse phylogenies  <cit> . it has been suggested that the sm/j strain may be related to the current dba strains, dba/1j and dba/2j, as one of the seven strains contributing to the base population that was selected for smaller body weight was a dba strain named after its dilute brown agouti coat color  <cit> . comparison of snps between lg/j or sm/j and the sequenced dba/2j shows no specific relationship between sm/j and dba/2j. however, the percent shared snps between inbred mouse strains can be biased by the use of c57bl/6j as the reference genome since variants may be missed due to alignment quality favoring bases that match the reference.

functional predictions
deleterious amino acid mutations in lg/j and sm/j were predicted using three independent methods: lrt  <cit> , polyphen- <dig>  <cit>  and sift  <cit>  as implemented in vep  <cit> . the lrt compares the probability that a codon has evolved under a conserved model to the probability that a codon has evolved under a neutral model. the conserved model allows a codon to have evolved under negative selection and the neutral model assumes the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations are not significantly different. polyphen- <dig> uses both sequence- and structure-based predictive features to characterize the functional importance of a mutation, making use of non-redundant protein databases. sift is based on the principles of protein evolution and has been applied to a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. the algorithm is based on sequence homology and uses a median conservation score to measure protein conservation. the numbers of deleterious amino acid predictions for each strain are listed in table  <dig> and predicted scores are provided in additional file  <dig>  the intersections of these predictions for snps that are polymorphic between lg/j and sm/j are illustrated in figure  <dig>  it is worth noting that the three different methods give largely non-overlapping results, which is consistent with a similar analysis using human genomes  <cit> . this result implies that our ability to reliably annotate whole genome sequences is still somewhat lacking.table  <dig>

in addition to sift predictions, vep identifies variants falling in noncoding and potentially regulatory regions that may impact a gene’s expression. an overview of potentially functional regulatory variants is listed in table  <dig> and positions and scores are provided in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

lg/j, sm/j identical by descent regions
we identified genomic regions that are highly conserved between lg/j and sm/j using a hidden markov model . these regions are defined as stretches of sequenced dna ≥ 50kbp in length containing little to no polymorphism between the strains. these regions are likely to be identical by descent , and are non-randomly distributed throughout the genome, being more clustered than expected by chance . we classified 39% of the lg/j and sm/j sequenced genomes as ibd.

lg x sm qtl and whole-genome sequences
we integrated all of these data – ibd regions, polymorphisms and functional predictions – with  <dig> published qtl for metabolic traits  and for bone-growth traits  mapped in very advanced intercrosses of lgxsm  <cit> . lod scores range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and are significant for their respective study. additional file  <dig> describes these qtl, including their genomic coordinates, and their integration with various sequence characterizations. figure  <dig> illustrates these qtl in relation to the sequence parameters we have generated. we find that 27% of all qtl interrogated in this study are covered by ibd bases, whereas 39% would be expected if they were randomly distributed. we find that both trait-specific qtl peaks  and qtl-specific peaks  are over-represented in non-ibd regions . further, we find that qtl regions are more likely to harbor variants that are predicted to have a functional impact by comparing the number of amino-acid changing variants predicted to be damaging by at least one algorithm and the number of variants predicted to fall in high-impact positions of transcription factor binding sites to empirical distributions of numbers generated from  <dig> sets of randomly chosen non-qtl, non-ibd regions of similar size .

integrating these data provides an opportunity to examine variation between lg/j and sm/j from both bottom-up  and top-down  perspectives with the goal of identifying plausible quantitative trait nucleotides  for testing mechanistic hypotheses. to illustrate a bottom-up approach, we focus on a snp identified in the sm/j strain  falling in a cmyb tfbs  with a predicted high-impact . this position overlaps regulatory elements including h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> histone marks and a dnase <dig> hypersensitive site . the snp falls in an intronic region of the oligopeptidase neurolysin, nln . nln knockout mice have been shown to be more insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant and to have increased gluconeogenesis relative to littermate controls  <cit> . in mammals, the liver is the main site of gluconeogenesis. a microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression shows nln to be highly significantly differentially expressed between lg/j and sm/j, with the sm/j strain’s expression barely detectable  <cit> . this gene falls within the support intervals of a qtl associated with basal serum glucose levels in an f <dig> generation of an advanced intercross  between the lg/j and sm/j strains  <cit> . thus nln is an attractive candidate quantitative trait gene  and this snp is an attractive quantitative trait nucleotide  for further mechanistic studies of nln involvement in glucose metabolism.figure  <dig> connecting a putative quantitative trait nucleotide  with a candidate quantitative trait gene . a: a snp identified in the sm/j strain  falls in a highly informative position  of a predicted cmyb tfbs. b and c: this snp falls in an intron of nln, a protein-coding gene associated with gluconeogenesis. nln falls in a qtl associated with variation in basal glucose levels in an f <dig> generation of a lg x sm advanced intercross and is highly significantly differentially expressed between the lg/j and sm/j strains. c: this variant overlaps multiple regulatory elements and is a strong candidate for mechanistic studies of nln function in glucose metabolism.



to illustrate a top-down approach, we focus on a qtl mapped in an f <dig> generation of the lgxsm ai that is associated with variation in tibia length at chr6:  <dig> ,821- <dig> , <dig> . there are  <dig> protein coding genes and  <dig> rna genes falling within the qtl support interval  <cit> . two of these genes, wnt <dig>  and ptprz <dig> , are involved in limb development and/or bone formation  <cit> . variants in a third gene, cped <dig> , have recently been associated with variation in bone mineral density in a gwas  <cit> . 23% of this qtl is covered by bases falling in ibd regions, but these three genes are located in non-ibd portions of the qtl. three nonsynonymous snps fall in cped <dig> and are predicted to have functional consequences by at least one of the algorithms used: lrt, polyphen or sift. a fourth nonsynonymous snp is predicted to have functional consequences by all three algorithms making it a highly attractive qtn. the snp falls in exon  <dig> of ptprz <dig> . this exon is highly conserved. sanger sequencing confirmed the sm/j variant and the amino acid changing polymorphism between the strains. ptprz <dig> encodes the protein r-ptp-z, which is thought to modulate osteoblast metabolism through dephosphorylating src, which plays a key role in osteoblast activities such as adhesion and differentiation  <cit> . the amino acid change occurs in the sm/j strain, and the only other strain of sequenced mouse carrying this variant is nzo/hlltj. nzo/hlltj is a common laboratory strain used as a model of metabolic syndrome because of its extreme obesity and hyperglycemic phenotype  <cit> . it bears no special relationship with sm/j, despite sharing this particular variant and a similar metabolic phenotype on a high-fat diet.figure  <dig> connecting phenotypic variation  to a candidate quantitative trait gene  and putative quantitative trait nucleotide . a and b: variation in tibia length  between lg and sm mapped to a qtl on chromosome  <dig>  c: this qtl was localized to a genomic region and intersected with lg/j, sm/j snps and ibd regions. d: snps falling in non-ibd regions were interrogated and a snp falling in exon  <dig> of ptprz <dig>  which affects bone-growth, was identified. the snp changes the encoded amino acid from proline to histidine. e: this amino acid is 100% ibd and the amino acid variant occurs in sm/j and one other unrelated strain of laboratory mouse, nzo/hlltj. this snp is predicted to be functionally damaging by the lrt, polyphen- <dig> and sift algorithms, and represents a fruitful candidate qtn for further functional follow-up.



CONCLUSIONS
here we describe the whole-genome sequences for the lg/j and sm/j inbred mouse strains. lg/j and sm/j are frequently compared in qtl mapping studies because of their great phenotypic diversity, and because this diversity is normally distributed in intercrosses of these two strains. this makes lg x sm an ideal model system for studying the genetic architecture of normal variation in complex traits, because this most closely mimics that found in human populations, where most variation is the result of many interacting genes of individually small effects. comparison with previous imputation methods using snps called from low-coverage sequence for lg/j and sm/j indicated that there were many unreported variants in these strains  <cit> . our sequence provides higher resolution, which allows us to capture more of the genomic sequence variation found in these strains with greater certainty.

because we are interested in identifying candidate variants for functional follow-up, our first order of business was to identify regions of the lg/j and sm/j genomes that do not vary between the strains. identification of ibd genomic regions is a powerful way to narrow existing qtl support intervals, as the regions that do not vary between the strains are unlikely to cause variation in the mapped trait. further, identification of ibd and non-ibd regions between two strains is a powerful tool for testing mechanistic hypotheses and for planning focused candidate gene studies  <cit> . we classified 39% of the lg/j and sm/j sequenced genomes as ibd, and we are able to use this classification to narrow qtl support intervals by orders of magnitude when eliminating stretches of dna that contain little to no variation between the parental strains within qtl support intervals. eliminating these regions does not explicitly rule them out as harboring potentially causal variants, however focusing on the non-ibd sequence within qtl support intervals – especially on the variants predicted to have functional consequences – allows one to prioritize the so-called ‘low-hanging fruit’. other commonly used strain pairs, such as c57bl/6j and dba/2j, have been sequenced but have not been subject to such close evaluation of ibd genomic regions within qtl.

we integrated the rich source of qtl results generated by very advanced intercrosses of lg x sm for metabolic traits  mapped in the f <dig> and for bone-growth traits  mapped in the f <dig> generations with the lg/j and sm/j genomic sequences. the median qtl interval in the f <dig> data is ≈  <dig> mb and for the f <dig> it is ≈  <dig> mb . we find that ≈ 29% of f <dig> and ≈ 19% of f <dig> qtl intervals are covered by ibd regions. subtracting these ibd regions from qtl reduces the genomic search space for both generations, resulting in a comparable ≈  <dig> mb median number of per qtl bases for both f <dig> and f <dig> generations. we find that qtl from both generations have proportionally equivalent numbers of snvs, bases covered by svs, and bases predicted to have functional consequences . further, we find that qtl regions as a class are more likely to harbor variants predicted to have functional consequences relative to randomly selected non-qtl and non-ibd genomic regions of similar size .

the traits associated with the qtl interrogated here belong to different classes of quantitative phenotype, namely metabolic traits mapped in the f <dig> generation and developmental traits mapped in the f <dig> generation. having qtl for the same trait replicate in multiple generations of a mapping study increases the probability that the qtl is causal. however, given the high costs  of breeding and maintaining large populations of mice for many generations, incorporating whole-genome sequence parameters as we have illustrated here can be used to extract compelling information from qtl mapped in earlier generations of intercrosses, even when the support intervals span many mega-bases of sequence. thus whole-genome sequence data should be made part of the toolkit used to inform the design, execution and follow-up of qtl mapping studies.

we have highlighted variants falling in a qtl on chromosome  <dig> associated with basal glucose levels and a qtl on chromosome  <dig> associated with tibia length  to illustrate how all of these data – whole genome sequence variants, ibd regions, qtl, and functional predictions – can be integrated with each other and with other public datasets to identify and prioritize qtg and qtn. identifying such variants within qtl in mice can facilitate translational research for correlated traits in human studies, and potentially uncover genetic underpinnings of disease phenotypes  <cit> . our initial description and analysis of the lg/j and sm/j whole genomes offers new data that can be used to address fundamental questions about the molecular nature of quantitative phenotypic variation in an important model system.
