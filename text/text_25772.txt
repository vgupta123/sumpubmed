BACKGROUND
the neural crest  is a transient, multipotent and migratory population of cells present in early vertebrate development. nc cells arise from the lateral folds of the neural plate at neurulation and give rise to a multitude of cell types including pigment cells, neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, craniofacial skeleton and cartilage, and adrenal medullary cells  <cit> . defects in nc development underlie several human diseases such as waardenburg syndrome, hirschsrpung disease and digeorge syndrome, which present a spectrum of phenotypes including craniofacial defects, ocular, pigmentary and otic defects, enteric hypoganglionosis, and cardiac malformations  <cit> . despite significant recent progress in the identification of key signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in nc induction, the hierarchical relationships between these pathways and factors are not well understood.

one critical gene in this network is erbb <dig>  a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the epidermal growth factor  receptor family. other members of the family include receptors such as egfr <dig>  erbb <dig> and erbb <dig>  <cit> . the structure of erbb <dig> includes an extracellular domain, which interacts with ligands neuregulin <dig> and neuregulin <dig>  and a cytoplasmic domain. unlike other members of the egf receptor family, the cytoplasmic domain of erbb <dig> lacks tyrosine kinase activity  <cit> . erbb <dig> is therefore thought to heterodimerize with erbb <dig>  which lacks a cognate receptor but possesses tyrosine kinase activity, in order to activate downstream pathways  <cit> . upon activation, erbb <dig> triggers several downstream pathways such as pi3k, mapk, protein kinase c, jak-stat and plcÎ³  <cit> .

erbb <dig> plays important roles in the development of the nc and its derivative tissues. consistent with these observations, expression analyses in mouse and zebrafish have detected erbb3/erbb3b transcripts in pre-migratory and migratory nc, and various nc derivatives including, cranial ganglia, posterior lateral line ganglia and schwann cells  <cit> . expression has also been observed in non-nc derived populations including the brain, olfactory lobes and myotome  <cit> . furthermore, mice harbouring targeted mutant alleles of erbb <dig> exhibit defects in the formation of nc and its derivatives. homozygous null mice display a dramatic reduction in numbers of schwann cells, hypoplastic cardiac cushion mesenchyme and cardiac valves, defects in cranial ganglia formation and cerebellar hypoplasia  <cit> . erbb <dig> deficient mice also demonstrate a lack of chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla  <cit> . furthermore, targeted deletions of nrg <dig> and erbb <dig>  a ligand and a binding partner of erbb <dig> respectively, result in nc cell migration defects  <cit> . more recently, several in vitro and zebrafish studies have revealed a potential role for erbb <dig> in melanocyte development and in melanoma  <cit> . consistent with these data, erbb <dig> has been implicated in other neoplasias including breast cancer and lung cancer  <cit> . however, what factors act upstream of erbb <dig> to direct its expression and function in the variety of cell types derived from nc cells is not well understood. even less well understood is the genomic sequence basis of the transcriptional regulatory control that facilitates the cell fate decisions and homeostatic maintenance of these cells during development

one factor proposed to regulate erbb <dig> is sox <dig>  a member of the soxe family of transcription factors  <cit> . sox <dig> is indispensible for proper neural crest development and loss of sox <dig> leads to reductions of specific nc derivatives including peripheral neurons and melanocytes  <cit> . also, sox <dig> mutations have been discovered in several patients with waardenburg syndrome and syndromic hirschsprung disease  <cit> . however, data generated to date linking sox <dig> and erbb <dig> have been largely correlative. both sox <dig> and erbb <dig> share overlapping expressions patterns and deletions of sox <dig> and erbb <dig> affect overlapping cell populations such as schwann cells, cranial ganglia and sympathetic neurons. in mice where the endogenous sox <dig> locus has been replaced by a lacz cassette, erbb <dig> expression is initiated in premigratory nc but is lost once the cells begin migrating  <cit> , suggesting erbb <dig> regulation by sox <dig>  furthermore erbb <dig> transcript levels increase upon overexpression of sox <dig> in neuro2a neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . however, it is not known if this regulation is direct or indirect because the regulatory topography of erbb <dig> has not yet been uncovered, and nor have any sox <dig> responsive elements been demonstrated at the erbb <dig> locus.

in this study, we address the transcriptional regulation of erbb <dig> during neural crest development. we use sequence constraint as a metric predictive of function to identify putative regulatory elements at the human erbb <dig> locus. we test the regulatory potential of these elements in vitro in two cell lines representative of neural crest derived tissues. we also test each element for epigenetic marks consistent with enhancer activity. we verify enhancer activity of each element in vivo using zebrafish transgenesis, identifying three transcriptional enhancers of erbb <dig>  one intronic enhancer termed erbb3_mcs <dig> displays the strongest enhancer activity in vitro and high enrichment for h3k4me <dig>  we demonstrate that this enhancer is responsive to and dependent on sox <dig> for its regulatory behaviour. similarly, we demonstrate that sox <dig> is necessary and sufficient for activation of the endogenous erbb <dig>  furthermore, we also demonstrate that erbb3_mcs <dig> directs expression in nc cells and their derivative lineages in vivo in zebrafish, and that the requirement for sox <dig> for its regulation is maintained in vivo as well. therefore, we conclude that sox <dig> likely contributes to the transcriptional modulation of erbb <dig> acting at least in part directly via erbb3_mcs <dig> 

RESULTS
multi-species conserved sequences  at the erbb <dig> locus direct reporter expression in erbb <dig> expressing cell lines and show epigenetic marks consistent with enhancer activity
as in previous studies, we used sequence constraint to identify putative regulatory enhancers of erbb <dig>  <cit> . briefly, we identified evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences at the human erbb <dig> locus using phastcons   <cit> , selecting eight sequences for functional analyses . we amplified and cloned each of the sequences upstream of an e1b minimal promoter driving a luciferase reporter. we tested the regulatory potential of each of the sequences to drive transcription via luciferase assays in two nc derived cell lines, cultured mouse melanocytes  and cultured rat schwann cells , both of which express erbb <dig> . of the eight mcs elements amplified and tested, five  directed luciferase reporter expression at levels significantly higher than the promoter only luciferase construct in both cell lines  . furthermore, erbb3_mcs <dig> showed the greatest increase in luciferase activity- approximately 23-fold greater than the promoter only construct  in melan-a cells and approximately 150-fold greater than the promoter only construct in s <dig> cells. interestingly, although erbb3_mcs <dig> overlaps erbb3_mcs <dig>  it demonstrates lower luciferase activity than mcs <dig> in melan-a cells. this suggests that there may be transcriptional repressor elements in erbb3_mcs <dig> that are causing it to drive lower reporter expression in the luciferase assay. when the eight erbb3_mcs elements were tested in a cell line that does not express erbb <dig> , none directed higher luciferase activity than the promoter only construct . therefore, this suggests that erbb3_mcs  <dig>  mcs <dig>  mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> are potentially enhancers of erbb <dig> expression in the nc.

in order to determine whether these mcs elements were indeed enhancers within their genomic context, we assayed the presence of an epigenetic mark previously shown to be predictive of enhancer function. since h3k <dig> monomethylation  has been shown to be enriched at transcriptional enhancers, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation  to determine whether h3k4me <dig> marks were enriched at the mouse orthologs of erbb3_mcs elements within the genomic context of melan-a cells  <cit> . we used an antibody against h3k4me <dig> and an isotype control igg to immunoprecipitate sheared crosslinked chromatin from these cells. we analyzed immunoprecipitation using real-time pcr and calculated enrichment using the percent input method . erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> showed consistently low levels of enrichment upon immunoprecipitation with the h3k4me <dig> antibody as compared to the igg control samples, whereas erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig>  mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> showed consistently high levels of enrichment upon immunoprecipitation as compared to the igg samples. a control sequence  <dig> mb upstream of erbb <dig> was not enriched in h3k4me <dig> samples as compared to igg samples. erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> showed the highest levels of enrichment as compared to the igg samples. this contrasts with the low luciferase activity driven by these sequences in vitro, consistent with reports suggesting that h3k4me <dig> is not sufficient to distinguish between functionally active and inactive enhancers  <cit> . elements erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> however did show increased luciferase activity as well as h3k4me <dig> marks, suggesting that these sequences may be functional endogenous enhancers of erbb <dig> in nc-derived cell types.

erbb3_mcs <dig> harbours putative transcription factor binding sites for key neural crest transcription factors
since erbb3_mcs <dig> demonstrated the highest luciferase activity in vitro and showed enrichment for h3k4me <dig> consistent with a role for erbb3_mcs <dig> as an enhancer of erbb <dig>  we focused our subsequent analyses on this element. to determine what pathways or transcription factors may be acting upon this element and hence potentially modulating erbb <dig> expression, we queried three publicly available transcription factor identification databases  to identify putative transcription factor binding sites  within this sequence. to refine our search further we prioritized sites that were found by two or more tf databases, selecting those that corresponded to transcription factors with known roles in nc development . we identified two soxe sites  and one ap <dig> site . members of the soxe family, sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig>  bind to the soxe consensus site 5'-aacaat-3'. the identification of soxe family  motifs is consistent with the predicted role for sox <dig> in erbb <dig> modulation. soxe proteins typically bind the consensus site 5'-aacaat-3'. both soxe- <dig> and soxe- <dig> contain the 5'-acaat-3' core sequence but differ from the consensus in that the 5'-most adenine is replaced by a cytosine. ap <dig> is a retinoic acid inducible transcription factor that binds to the consensus sequence 5'-ccccaggc-3'  <cit> . it is expressed in the nc and its derivatives including cranial and sensory ganglia and facial mesenchyme and has a known role in the regulation of erbb <dig> expression  <cit> . the erbb <dig> promoter harbours potential ap <dig> binding sites, causing speculation of the role of ap <dig> as an erbb <dig> regulator  <cit> .

soxe <dig> is required for enhancer activity of erbb3_mcs6
we set out to determine the importance of the soxe and ap <dig> transcription factor families in modulating the activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> by mutating predicted binding sites in the context of a pe1b promoter driving a luciferase reporter. we then compared the luciferase activity of each mutant construct to that of the wild-type erbb3_mcs <dig> sequence in the melan-a cell line, which expresses sox <dig>  erbb <dig> and ap <dig> . mutation of the soxe <dig> but not the soxe <dig> motif significantly reduced enhancer activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> . this observation is consistent with a suggested role for sox <dig> in regulating erbb <dig> in nc-derived populations  <cit> . however, since mutation of the soxe- <dig> site does not completely abrogate erbb3_mcs <dig>  this suggests that additional factors may also be responsible for the activity of erbb3_mcs <dig>  by contrast, mutation of the ap <dig> site does not significantly reduce luciferase activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> across replicate experiments. however, we cannot exclude the presence of a non-canonical ap <dig> site that may be required for erbb3_mcs <dig> activity independent of or in addition to this site.

sox <dig> is necessary for erbb3_mcs <dig> enhancer activity and erbb <dig> expression
since mutation of the soxe- <dig> binding site caused a significant reduction in erbb3_mcs <dig> enhancer activity, we asked whether sox <dig> may be acting through erbb3_mcs <dig> to regulate erbb <dig> in nc populations. we used sirna  to transiently knock down sox <dig> gene product in melan-a cells and assayed the effect of the knockdown on erbb3_mcs <dig> activity via luciferase assays, as before. consistent with significantly reduced erbb3_mcs <dig> activity . sox <dig> knockdown was confirmed via western blot as shown in figure 2c. we also determined the effect of sox <dig> knockdown on endogenous erbb <dig> protein levels in melan-a cells. as shown in figure 2d, knockdown of sox <dig> causes a decrease of endogenous erbb <dig> protein levels. similarly, we interfered with sox <dig> protein function in s <dig> cells using a previously characterized construct expressing a dominant negative mutant form of sox <dig>  under the control of a cmv promoter  <cit> . the e189x mutant protein has an intact dna binding domain but lacks a transactivation domain. upon transfection of s <dig> cells with this mutant cdna of sox <dig>  there was a significant decrease in luciferase activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> . taken together, these experiments demonstrate that sox <dig> is necessary for the expression of erbb <dig> and for enhancer activity of erbb3_mcs <dig>  consistent with its predicted role in modulating erbb <dig>  knockdown of ap <dig> in melan-a cells also led to a significant reduction in erbb3_mcs <dig> transcriptional activity . furthermore, ap <dig> knockdown also reduced endogenous erbb <dig> protein levels , consistent with previous evidence for a role for ap <dig> in regulating erbb <dig>  <cit> .

sox <dig> is sufficient for erbb3_mcs <dig> enhancer activity and erbb <dig> expression
given that sox <dig> is necessary for erbb3_mcs <dig> enhancer activity, we next tested whether sox <dig> is also sufficient for erbb3_mcs <dig> activity. we transiently co-transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells  with the erbb3_mcs <dig> luciferase vector and with either a construct expressing wild-type sox <dig> cdna under the control of a cmv promoter  or with an empty expression vector. neuro2a cells were selected due to low expression levels of sox <dig> and erbb <dig> and because this cell line has been previously used to study the interaction between sox <dig> and erbb <dig>  <cit> . in the presence of sox <dig>  the transcriptional activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> increased almost 25-fold, compared to cells co-transfected with the empty vector . in the absence of sox <dig>  erbb3_mcs <dig> does not display significant transcriptional activity in neuro2a cells. further, consistent with a role for sox <dig> in directly regulating mcs <dig>  mutation of the soxe- <dig> site abrogates the increase in transcriptional activity. similar results were also seen when human sox <dig> cdna was used in co-transfection experiments in nih3t <dig> cells . on the other hand, ap <dig> was unable to significantly transactivate erbb3_mcs <dig> in nih3t <dig> cells . also, when added in combination with sox <dig>  it was unable to increase transcriptional activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> in a manner that is more than additive when compared to sox <dig> and ap <dig> independent transactivation, further suggesting that ap <dig> and sox <dig> do not interact to regulate erbb3_mcs <dig> 

to further investigate the role of sox <dig> in regulating erbb3_mcs <dig>  we next determined whether established disease causing mutations in sox <dig> might in part mediate their regulation of erbb <dig> via erbb3_mcs <dig>  to this end, we used a sox <dig> mutant cdna expression construct , hereby referred to as sox10-Îstp to transactivate erbb3_mcs <dig>  this mutant was first discovered in the dom mouse model of hirschsrpung disease  <cit>  and has a single nucleotide  insertion at nucleotide  <dig> of the coding sequence, leading to a translational frameshift. the resulting protein possesses an intact dna binding domain but  <dig> novel nucleotides replace the putative activation domain. the resulting protein inhibits the activity of wild-type sox <dig> in a dominant negative fashion. co-transfection of erbb3_mcs <dig> with sox10-Îstp does not result in erbb3_mcs <dig> activity . additionally, Îstp also compromises the transactivation of erbb3_mcs <dig> by wild-type sox <dig> as seen in cells co-transfected with both the wild-type and the mutant forms of sox <dig>  this implies that erbb3_mcs <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of erbb <dig> by sox <dig> 

if erbb3_mcs <dig> were indeed an important link in the regulation of erbb <dig> expression by sox <dig>  we would expect the overexpression of wild-type sox <dig>  but not the sox10-Îstp mutant, to increase endogenous transcript levels of erbb <dig>  in fact, when we examined the levels of erbb <dig> transcript in neuro2a cells upon sox <dig> overexpression, we found that it was seven-fold higher than erbb <dig> transcript levels in the absence of sox <dig> . furthermore, sox10-Îstp was unable to increase erbb <dig> transcript levels and it also impeded the ability of the wild-type protein to increase erbb <dig> transcript levels. an increase in total sox <dig> transcript levels upon overexpression was verified via real-time pcr . therefore, this implies that sox <dig> is sufficient for the transcriptional activation of erbb <dig> 

sox <dig> physically binds erbb3_mcs6
we next used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine if erbb3_mcs <dig> physically binds protein in a manner dependent on the soxe- <dig> motif. we generated  <dig> bp probes that span the soxe- <dig> binding site and labeled the probes with biotin. we then incubated the probes with nuclear extract derived from melan-a cells and subjected the reactions to gel electrophoresis. as seen in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  a factor in the melan-a nuclear extract bound the probe and retarded its migration in the gel, causing a shift. this binding was successfully competed away by using increasing amounts of unlabeled probe. to determine whether this binding was specific to the soxe- <dig> binding site, we next mutated the soxe- <dig> binding site and incubated unlabeled mutant probe with nuclear extract. as is seen in lane  <dig> of additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the mutant cold probe was unable to compete away the binding, thus indicating that the gel shift seen is specific to binding at the soxe- <dig> binding site. in order to assay whether sox <dig> directly binds to erbb3_mcs <dig>  we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative pcr using an antibody directed against sox <dig> in s <dig> cells. as shown in figure 2i, the rat ortholog of erbb3_mcs <dig> is enriched in sox <dig> immunoprecipitated samples but not in igg immunoprecipitated samples. this binding is specific to sox <dig> as knocking down sox <dig> protein levels in s <dig> via sirnas caused a loss of enrichment of erbb3_mcs <dig> upon sox <dig> immunoprecipitated in these cells. collectively, this implies that sox <dig> directly binds erbb3_mcs <dig> 

erbb3_mcs <dig> directs reporter expression in a neural crest specific manner reminiscent of erbb3b expression in zebrafish
in order to confirm that erbb3_mcs <dig> is an enhancer of erbb <dig> in vivo, we generated stable transgenic zebrafish lines of erbb3_mcs <dig> driving an egfp reporter using a tol <dig> based zebrafish transgenesis assay  <cit> . briefly, we cloned erbb3_mcs <dig> upstream of a cfos minimal promoter driving enhanced green fluorescent protein . we then injected this sequence into 1- <dig> cell zebrafish embryos, screened g <dig> embryos for vector integration, and evaluated their offspring for germ line reporter expression. reporter expression was assayed in four independent transgenic lines and compared to previously published patterns of endogenous erbb3/erbb3b expression  <cit> . consistent with its strong in vitro regulatory potential, erbb3_mcs <dig> drove reporter expression in nc populations as early as  <dig> hours post fertilization  in transgenic zebrafish in a manner reminiscent of erbb3b expression . expression was noted in cranial neural crest, migratory and pre-migratory crest, all regions where erbb3/erbb3b is known to be expressed   <cit> . at  <dig> hpf, expression was noted in the dorsal root ganglia, posterior lateral line ganglia and in schwann cell precursors, consistent with known erbb3/erbb3b expression   <cit> . finally, at  <dig> hpf expression was noted in cells that are consistent in shape and position with mature oligodendrocytes   <cit> . therefore, erbb3_mcs <dig> drives reporter expression in vivo in neural crest cells and its derivative tissues in a manner consistent with erbb3b expression. two other sequences, erbb3_mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> also drove consistent expression in multiple founders in nc-derived populations consistent with erbb3/erbb3b expression . although erbb3_mcs <dig> did not show significant enhancer activity in vitro, or h3k4me <dig> marks, it demonstrated expression in vivo in a manner consistent with erbb <dig> expression. this sequence directed reporter expression starting at  <dig> hpf in the mesencephalon, olfactory bulbs, cranial ganglia and pharyngeal arches, all regions of demonstrated erbb <dig> expression  <cit> . erbb3_mcs <dig> also directed expression in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and in the hindbrain, regions where erbb <dig> function has been shown to be essential  <cit>  . furthermore, this element directed expression in cells lining the anterior lateral line neurons and the epiphysis . consistent with its strong in vitro regulatory potential and h3k4me <dig> marks, erbb3_mcs <dig> directed reporter expression in vivo. erbb3_mcs <dig> drove egfp expression in vivo, beginning at  <dig> hpf in the mesencephalon, the hindbrain and the pharyngeal arches. it also directed expression in the myotome consistent with endogenous erbb <dig> expression  <cit>  . this suggests that erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> are all nc-directed enhancers of erbb <dig> 

soxe- <dig> motif is necessary for the activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> in vivo in zebrafish
to determine the contribution of the soxe- <dig> motif to the proper expression of erbb3_mcs <dig> in vivo, we generated stable transgenic zebrafish lines with erbb3_mcs <dig> harbouring a mutation in the soxe- <dig> motif. we identified three independent stable transgenic zebrafish lines with the soxe-2m erbb3_mcs <dig> construct directing egfp expression. egfp expression was inconsistent among these lines. this may either be a direct result of position effect based on the position of integration of the vector, or mutation of the soxe- <dig> motif may make the sequence more amenable to position effect due to loss of proper regulatory control. in one of the three lines, egfp expression was not seen at  <dig> hpf whereas in the remaining two lines egfp expression was qualitatively similar to expression directed by the wt erbb3_mcs <dig> construct at  <dig> hpf . additionally, mutation of this site may yield quantitative differences in egfp expression between the wt and mutant constructs. technical reasons such as variation in transgene copy number and position effect preclude the use of this assay to evaluate such differences. therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional elements within erbb3_mcs <dig> may be sufficient for its expression in nc in the early embryo. however, at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, expression driven by the mutant construct was qualitatively different across all founders as compared to expression directed by the wt construct. expression was lost from dorsal root ganglia cells and schwann cells in  <dig> hpf soxe-2m erbb3_mcs <dig> transgenic embryos. expression domains were gained within these mutants in the notochord and cells of the ventral spinal cord . furthermore, at  <dig> hpf expression was not seen in oligodendroglial cells in soxe-2m erbb3_mcs <dig> transgenic embryos . however, at both  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, expression in the ectomesenchymal derivatives of the nc such as in the pharyngeal arches was maintained in the mutant transgenic fish . this is in agreement with a known role for sox <dig> in non-ectomesenchymal but not in ectomesenchymal nc populations in the zebrafish  <cit> . this suggests that additional elements within erbb3_mcs <dig> are sufficient for the expression of this sequence in ectomesenchymal derivatives of the nc. therefore, the soxe- <dig> motif is important for the proper expression of erbb3_mcs <dig> in non-ectomesenchymal neural crest derivatives such as dorsal root ganglia and schwann cells, but not in premigratory and migratory crest cells or ectomesenchymal nc derivatives. however, based on the diminution and not complete abrogation of erbb3_mcs <dig> activity in vitro, we expect that mutation of this site may produce quantitative effects on the expression of erbb3_mcs <dig>  which cannot be assayed by zebrafish transgenesis. therefore, to address the role of sox <dig> in regulation erbb3_mcs <dig> in vivo, we used morpholinos analysis in zebrafish.

sox <dig> is necessary for the activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> in vivo in zebrafish
in order to determine whether sox <dig> is required for the enhancer activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> in vivo similar to its requirement in vitro, we used morpholinos against sox <dig> in the stable transgenic erbb3_mcs <dig> zebrafish to assay the effect of sox <dig> depletion on erbb3_mcs <dig> activity. using a previously published translation-blocking morpholino against the zebrafish sox <dig> gene product, we knocked down levels of sox <dig> in the erbb3_mcs <dig> transgenic zebrafish  <cit> . depletion of sox <dig> in zebrafish produces a phenocopy of the colourless  zebrafish mutant phenotype, which has been studied in detail  <cit> . although nc cells form upon sox <dig> depletion, they accumulate in the premigratory position and fail to migrate and differentiate appropriately into their subsequent lineages  <cit> . thus, if sox <dig> were necessary for erbb3_mcs <dig> expression, we would expect to see a loss of erbb3_mcs <dig> driven reporter expression in premigratory nc as well as a subsequent loss of expression in nc derived cell types such as schwann cells and drg due to the loss of these populations. consistent with our expectation, upon knocking down sox <dig>  we noted a complete loss of erbb3_mcs <dig> activity in the developing nc in one-day old embryos . this is in sharp contrast to the erbb3_mcs <dig> driven reporter expression seen in the premigratory and migratory nc of uninjected embryos . since the sox <dig> morpholino produces embryos with a range of phenotypes, in embryos that show a weaker phenotype, we noticed a reduced number of egfp expressing premigratory nc cells and highly reduced numbers of migrating crest at  <dig> hpf, consistent with a role for sox <dig> in regulation erbb3_mcs <dig> . egfp expression in the cranial nc was affected to a lesser degree in these embryos . however, egfp expression in  <dig> hpf embryos was noted in only 6/ <dig> injected embryos , which is in sharp contrast to the 27/ <dig> uninjected  embryos that showed egfp expression at  <dig> hpf. by  <dig> hpf, erbb3_mcs <dig> driven egfp expression was noted in morpholino injected embryos in cells that are consistent in position with premigratory nc . expression was also noted in some migratory nc, however, these cells are highly disorganized as compared to the egfp expressing cells seen in uninjected embryos consistent with migratory crest previously described for this model   <cit> . egfp expression persists in these non-migrating nc cells upto 96hpf  but is not seen in nc derived cells. therefore, this suggests that sox <dig> is necessary for the timely and proper expression of erbb3_mcs <dig> in neural crest cells and its derivative lineages in vivo in zebrafish.

discussion
although erbb <dig> is an important gene in the development and differentiation of a range of nc-derived populations, not much is known about the sequences and factors modulating its transcriptional output. sox <dig>  however, has been shown to influence erbb <dig> levels  <cit> , although, whether this regulation is direct or indirect was unknown. in this study, we identify novel regulatory enhancers of erbb <dig> that direct expression in nc derived cell lines and exhibit epigenetic marks consistent with enhancer activity. one of these enhancers, erbb3_mcs <dig> directs the strongest reporter expression in vitro and a broad overlap with endogenous erbb3b expression in vivo in zebrafish. we demonstrate that erbb3_mcs <dig> is dependent upon and is responsive to sox <dig> both in vitro and in vivo. furthermore, we also demonstrate that sox <dig> is both necessary and sufficient in vitro for endogenous erbb <dig> expression. finally, we demonstrate that sox <dig> physically binds to erbb3_mcs <dig>  suggesting that sox <dig> mediates its effect on erbb <dig>  at least in part, directly through erbb3_mcs <dig> 

using a combination of sequence constraint, in vitro luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and in vivo zebrafish transgenesis, we have identified three functional enhancers of erbb3- erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig>  although erbb3_mcs <dig> did not significantly drive luciferase activity in vitro or exhibit enrichment of h3k4me <dig> marks, it drove reporter expression in transgenic zebrafish embryos in a manner consistent with endogenous erbb3b expression. furthermore, although elements erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> showed increased luciferase activity in vitro, they did not exhibit nc-directed enhancer activity in vivo. this suggests that although in vitro assays are useful in assaying the regulatory potential of enhancer sequences, they represent a single stage and cell type in development as compared to the full spectrum of nc derivatives that can be assayed in vivo and can potentially overlook regulatory sequences, which may be active at different stages or cell types or may attribute activity to sequences that are not biologically functional. similarly, comparison of h3k4me <dig> marks and enhancer activity in the elements tested demonstrates that h3k4me <dig> is not sufficient to distinguish between active and inactive enhancers. erbb3_mcs <dig>  mcs <dig> and mcs <dig> showed very high levels of h3k4me <dig>  but did not direct transcriptional activity in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that additional epigenetic or transcriptional marks may be necessary to distinguish them from active enhancers. these data are consistent with recent reports that suggest that additional epigenetic marks such as h3k27ac may be necessary to distinguish between h3kem <dig> marked active and poised enhancers  <cit> .

the intronic enhancer erbb3_mcs <dig> demonstrated high transcriptional activity in vitro and also exhibited h3k4me <dig> marks. furthermore, it directed expression almost exclusively, and broadly, in developing nc populations. the role of ap <dig> in regulating erbb3_mcs <dig> remains unclear. mutation of the ap <dig> binding site does not significantly reduce transcriptional activity of erbb3_mcs <dig>  suggesting that it is not required for the activity of erbb3_mcs <dig>  furthermore, ectopic expression of ap <dig> does not increase transcriptional activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> . however, knockdown of ap <dig> caused a significant decrease in transcriptional activity of erbb3_mcs <dig> . therefore, although ap <dig> may be necessary for the activity of erbb3_mcs <dig>  it is not sufficient for transcriptional activity of erbb3_mcs <dig>  suggesting that it may act in concert with other transcription factors to mediate its effect on erbb3_mcs <dig>  based on the results of our assays, it does not seem that ap <dig> interacts with sox <dig> to regulate erbb3_mcs <dig>  although we cannot exclude the possibility that the contribution of ap <dig> to the regulation of erbb3_mcs <dig> may be rate limited by and secondary to regulation by sox <dig>  therefore, further examination will be required to determine how ap <dig> may regulate erbb3_mcs <dig> and what, if any, co-factors may mediate this regulation. since ap <dig> is known to regulate erbb <dig>  it is not surprising that we see a decrease in erbb <dig> protein levels upon ap <dig> knockdown in melan-a cells  <cit> , however whether this decrease is mediated in part via erbb3_mcs <dig> will require further investigation. similarly, it will also be interesting to determine what, if any, other tfs may be involved in regulating erbb <dig> via erbb3_mcs <dig> by expanding the search for functionally important sequence motifs therein.

however, by focusing our investigation on the role of sox <dig> in regulating erbb3_mcs <dig>  we show that it is directly responsive to sox <dig>  although there were two potential sox <dig> binding sites in erbb3_mcs <dig>  only one of them, soxe- <dig> was required in our in vitro assays. this site is perfectly conserved across mammals and mutation of the site causes a loss of sox <dig> responsiveness of erbb3_mcs <dig>  furthermore, mutation of the soxe- <dig> site affects the expression of erbb3_mcs <dig> in non-ectomesenchymal nc derivatives in zebrafish, but not in ectomesenchymal derivatives of nc or in early premigratory and migratory nc. although quantitative differences in expression of erbb3_mcs <dig> due to the soxe- <dig> mutation cannot be ruled out as they are below the threshold of detection by the zebrafish transgenesis assay, this data suggests that other motifs within erbb3_mcs <dig> may be sufficient for its expression in early nc and ectomesenchymal derivatives. however, using additional in vitro and in vivo assays, we established an important role for sox <dig> in regulating erbb3_mcs <dig> via the soxe- <dig> motif. knockdown of sox <dig> abrogates erbb3_mcs <dig> activity, whereas ectopic expression of sox <dig> induces erbb3_mcs <dig> response, demonstrating that sox <dig> is both necessary and sufficient for erbb3_mcs <dig> transcriptional activity. similarly, we also show that sox <dig> is both necessary and sufficient for erbb <dig> expression. this is consistent with previous data suggesting that erbb <dig> is under the control of sox <dig>  <cit> . using gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we also demonstrate direct binding of sox <dig> to erbb3_mcs <dig>  most likely mediated through the soxe- <dig> site. finally, we use morpholino analysis in erbb3_mcs <dig> transgenic zebrafish to demonstrate a requirement for sox <dig> in the proper expression of this enhancer. therefore, our data suggest that erbb3_mcs <dig> may play a critical role in mediating the regulation of erbb <dig> by sox <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified three transcriptional enhancers at the erbb <dig> locus, whose expression domains overlap nc-derived populations. we show that one such enhancer  directs reporter expression broadly in nc cells and, like erbb <dig>  is directly responsive to sox <dig>  implying that sox <dig> may act through this enhancer to regulate erbb <dig> transcription in the nc.
