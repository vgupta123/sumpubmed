BACKGROUND
sex determination refers to the developmental programme that commits the embryo to following either the male or the female pathway. recent years have seen a great amount of interest in the evolution of developmental mechanisms at the genetic and molecular levels, and in determining the evolutionary processes by which these mechanisms came into existence. given the great variety of sex determination mechanisms, this process is exceptionally suitable for comparative study. indeed, sex determination has long been of major interest not only as a developmental process but also because of the evolutionary problem it poses - a problem that can only be solved by identifying and comparing the genetic structures of sex determination pathways. molecular genetic technologies now allow such comparisons to be made. in addition, sex determination in the drosophila melanogaster reference system is known in fine detail, making truly informative comparisons possible.

the characterisation of the sex determination genes in d. melanogaster has shown that their control during development is governed by the sex-specific splicing of their products . the product of a gene controls the sex-specific splicing of the pre-mrna from the downstream gene in the genetic cascade. sex-lethal  is at the top of this cascade and acts as the memory device for female sexual development via its auto-regulatory function: its product controls the splicing of its own pre-mrna  <cit> . in addition, sxl controls the splicing of the pre-mrna from the downstream gene transformer   <cit> . the tra product and the product of the constitutive gene transformer- <dig>  control the sex-specific splicing of pre-mrna from the gene doublesex   <cit> , which is transcribed in both sexes but gives rise to two different proteins, dsxf and dsxm  <cit> . these are transcription factors that impose female and male sexual development respectively via the sex-specific regulation of the so-called sexual cytodifferentiation genes.

genes homologous to the sex determination genes of d. melanogaster have been sought in other insects . in the sciarid flies, which belong to the dipteran suborder nematocera, only the orthologues of gene sxl have been characterised in sciara ocellaris  <cit> , bradysia coprophila, rynchosciara americana and trichosia pubescens  <cit> . the sxl gene of these species is not regulated in a sex-specific fashion, and therefore the same sxl transcript encoding the functional sxl protein is found in both males and females. thus, in the sciarids, sxl does not appear to play the key discriminating role in sex determination that it plays in drosophila.

apart from in d. melanogaster, the gene tra- <dig> has been studied in d. virilis  <cit> , and has been characterised in the housefly musca domestica  <cit> , in the tephritid ceratitis capitata  <cit> , in twelve anastrepha species  <cit> , and in the calliphorid lucilia cuprina  <cit> . outside the dipterans, tra- <dig> has been isolated in the lepidopteron bombyx mori  <cit> . in all cases tra- <dig> is transcribed in both sexes during development, producing the same protein in males and females. the injection of musca tra- <dig> dsrna into musca embryos results in the complete transformation of genotypically female embryos into fertile adult males, highlighting the role of tra- <dig> in musca sex determination. this gene is required for the female-specific splicing of musca dsx pre-mrna. it also participates in the autocatalytic activity of gene f  <cit> , i.e., the musca tra orthologous gene  <cit> , the key sex-determining gene in the housefly  <cit> . the injection of the respective tra2-dsrna into ceratitis  <cit>  and anastrepha  <cit>  results in the destruction of endogenous tra- <dig> function in both species and the subsequent male-specific splicing of the endogenous tra and dsx pre-mrnas, leading to the transformation of genotypically female embryos into adult pseudomales. this highlights the role of tra- <dig> in ceratitis and anastrepha sex determination.

the present paper reports the isolation and characterisation of tra- <dig> of s. ocellaris and b. coprophila . their tra <dig> proteins were compared to other known insect tra <dig> proteins and the effect of sciara tra- <dig> on drosophila sex determination analysed.

RESULTS
molecular organisation of tra- <dig> in s. ocellaris and b. coprophila
the first step in the isolation of the s. ocellaris tra- <dig> gene  was to perform rt-pcr on total rna from adults. reverse transcription was performed using the primer oligo-dt, while two-nested pcr reactions were performed with three degenerated primers: mar <dig>  mar <dig> and tra <dig> b . the first pcr reaction was performed using the primer pair mar <dig> plus mar <dig>  the second using mar <dig> plus tra <dig> b. an amplicon of  <dig> bp was amplified, cloned and sequenced. the conceptual amino acid sequence of this amplicon showed a high degree of similarity with the 3' region of the rrm domain of the d. melanogaster tra <dig> protein, indicating that a fragment of the putative sotra <dig> protein had been isolated.

nested pcr reactions were then performed in 3' and 5' race analyses. the amplicons were then cloned and sequenced. a genomewalker library for s. ocellaris was then synthesised and used to perform pcr genome-walking on the genomic dna of s. ocellaris from the initial amplicon towards the 5' and 3' directions. the genomic amplicons were cloned and sequenced. the sequences of the genomic fragments thus generated were compared with the cdna sequences previously determined. in this way, the exon/intron junctions were unambiguously identified. figure 1a shows the molecular organisation of sotra <dig>  its transcription unit was made up of  <dig> bp and was composed of six exons and five introns . the transcription start site was located  <dig> bp upstream of the translation initiation codon.

overlapping pcr on total rna of s. ocellaris males and females showed that the gene sotra <dig> mainly produced the transcript sotra2- <dig>  formed by exons e1-e2-e3-e4b-e5-e <dig> . this encoded a full-length putative tra <dig> protein of  <dig> amino acids that included the rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rrm domains characteristic of the tra <dig> proteins. two other less abundant transcripts were also detected: sotra2- <dig> and sotra2- <dig>  . the sotra2- <dig> transcript differed from sotra2- <dig> in its lack of exon  <dig>  and it encoded a putative tra <dig> protein of  <dig> amino acids that differed from the full tra <dig> protein in its shorter rs <dig> domain. the sotra2- <dig> transcript differed from sotra2- <dig> by the inclusion of exon e4a. the latter carries translation stop codons causing the production of a truncated tra <dig> protein  <dig> amino acids long and lacking both the rrm and rs <dig> domains.

to isolate the gene tra- <dig> of b. coprophila , the same strategy used for the isolation of this gene in s. ocellaris was followed, except that the initial step involved pcr amplification of the genomic dna of adults using primers expsot <dig>  and expsot <dig> , corresponding to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of sotra <dig>  a genomic fragment of  <dig> bp was amplified, cloned and sequenced. its sequence showed 61% similarity to the corresponding region of sotra <dig>  suggesting that a genomic fragment of bctra <dig> had been cloned. as for sotra <dig>  5'race, 3'race and genome-walking methodologies were used to determine the molecular organisation of bctra <dig> . its transcription unit was made up of  <dig> bp and was composed of six exons and five introns.

overlapping pcr performed on total rna of males and females of b. coprophila showed that the gene bctra <dig> mainly produced the transcript bctra2- <dig>  formed by exons e1-e2-e3-e4b-e5-e <dig> . this encoded a full putative tra <dig> protein of  <dig> amino acids and included the rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rrm domains characteristic of tra <dig> proteins. three other less abundant transcripts were also detected: bctra2- <dig>  bctra2- <dig> and bctra2- <dig>  . the bctra2- <dig> transcript differed from bctra2- <dig> in its lack of exon 3; it encoded a putative tra <dig> protein of  <dig> amino acids. the bctra2- <dig> transcript varied from bctra2- <dig> by the inclusion of exon e4a, which carries translation stop codons. thus, it produced a truncated tra <dig> protein of  <dig> amino acids that lacked both the rrm and rs <dig> domains. finally, the bctra2- <dig> transcript, made up by exons e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  encoded a truncated tra <dig> protein with short rs <dig>  rrm and rs <dig> domains.

expression pattern of tra- <dig> in s. ocellaris and b. coprophila
the expression of tra <dig> in s. ocellaris was studied by performing rt-pcr on total rna from a mixture of male plus female embryos, from a mixture of male plus female larvae at different developmental stages, from the heads plus thoraces of male and female adults , from the abdomens of male and female adults , and from adult ovaries and testis . the expression of tra <dig> in b. coprophila was similarly analysed, although in this case it was possible to distinguish male from female embryos as well as male from female larvae . the primers used were expsot <dig>  from exon  <dig> and expsot <dig>  from exon  <dig> , which have the same sequence in both sciara species. the expression of the constitutive gene rpl <dig>  which encodes the ribosomal protein l <dig>  was used as a control in rt-pcr. in all cases, a fragment of  <dig> bp was amplified . this was cloned and sequenced, confirming that it corresponded to the expected sotra <dig> or bctra <dig> fragment. negative controls in all these pcr reactions produced no amplicons . these results indicate that the genes sotra <dig> and bctra <dig> are expressed at all developmental stages and during adult life in both sexes, including in the gonads of males and females.

comparison of the molecular organisation of sciara tra- <dig> gene with that of other insects
the gene tra- <dig> of d. melanogaster gives rise to three mrnas by alternative splicing pathways and alternative promoters, which encode three distinct isoforms of the tra <dig> protein  <cit> . in b. mori, tra- <dig> produces six different transcripts by alternative splicing pathways, which encode six distinct isoforms of the tra <dig> protein  <cit> . in the case of other dipterans such as c. capitata  <cit> , anastrepha species  <cit> , m. domestica  <cit>  and l. cuprina  <cit> , only a single tra- <dig> mrna was detected.

comparison of the tra <dig> protein of sciara with that of other insects
the conceptual translation of the sotra2- <dig> and bctra2- <dig> mrnas showed them to encode a polypeptide with the main structural features characteristic of the sr protein family, i.e., the rna-binding motif  and two rs-domains. these are rich in serine-arginine dipeptides and confer upon these proteins the capacity to interact with others.

the putative tra <dig> protein of the dipterans s. ocellaris and b. coprophila  were compared to those of the dipterans belonging to the suborder brachycera, i.e., d. melanogaster , c. capitata , m. domestica  and l. cuprina , and that of the lepidopteran b. mori. figure  <dig> shows their alignment. the number of amino acids in these tra <dig> proteins varied: s. ocellaris  <dig>  b. coprophila  <dig>  d. melanogaster  <dig>  c. capitata  <dig>  m. domestica  <dig>  l. cuprina  <dig>  and b. mori  <dig>  these differences are due to changes throughout the tra <dig> protein except in the rrm domain and the linker region  in all these species. the highest degree of similarity  to s. ocellaris was shown by b. coprophila  , followed by musca , bombyx , ceratitis , lucilia  and drosophila . the highest degree of similarity was observed in the rrm  and the linker region . in fact, the linker region is a signature motif of tra <dig> proteins  <cit> . this conservation agrees with the fundamental role of rrm in the function of the tra-tra <dig> complex, conferring upon the complex its capacity to interact with the tra and dsx pre-mrnas and thus regulate its sex-specific splicing. the similarity of the rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  domains was lower and a variable number of sr dipeptides were seen, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> for rs <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> for rs <dig>  variation in the content of rs dipeptides seems to be a feature of the sr proteins whenever they are maintained enough to preserve their function  <cit> .

effect of the gene tra- <dig> of sciara on the somatic sexual development of drosophila
outside drosophila, the function of tra- <dig> in sex determination has been unambiguously demonstrated in m. domestica  <cit> , in c. capitata  <cit>  and in anastrepha  <cit>  using the interference-rna technique, which permits functional studies of genes in genetically less amenable organisms. an imperative of this technique is to have markers that allow one to determine whether male survivors really do correspond to xx females that have been transformed into pseudomales by the destruction of the endogenous tra- <dig> gene function, or to normal xy males. in the case of the insects mentioned above, this distinction was possible thanks to the existence of molecular markers located on the y chromosome  <cit>  and to the different morphology of the x and y chromosomes  <cit> . however, the lack of molecular makers, plus the fact that sciara females are xx and males are x <dig>  together with the extreme fragility of their tiny eggs, makes this rnai procedure unfeasible for these insects at the present time. thus, direct proof of the role of tra- <dig> in sciara sex determination remains elusive.

notwithstanding, we were able to study whether the sciara tra <dig> protein shows conserved sex-determination function in drosophila. the rationale of the experiment was to express transgenic sotra <dig> protein in drosophila xx pseudomales lacking the tra- <dig> gene function and checked whether these pseudomales showed feminisation. the gal4-uas system was used to analyse the effect of the sciara tra- <dig> gene in drosophila.

the systemic expression of sotra <dig> with the ubiquitous-expression da-gal <dig> or hs-gal <dig> drivers was found to be lethal to both male and female flies. the same lethality has been observed in drosophila males and females that ectopically express their own tra <dig> protein  <cit> . therefore, the rn-gal <dig> local expression driver was used. this driver expresses gal <dig> in agreement with the expression domain of the gene rotund , which is expressed in the tarsal region of the foreleg imaginal disc  <cit> , a well-characterised sexually dimorphic region of drosophila. for details of the experimental design see methods.

this reversion of the male towards the female phenotype of the foreleg basitarsus in xx pseudomales mutant for tra- <dig> and expressing the sotra <dig> protein is probably caused by the presence of the endogenous drosophila dsxf protein. as mentioned in the introduction, the tra-tra <dig> complex controls the female-specific splicing of the dsx pre-mrna. if the sciara tra <dig> protein is capable of forming a complex with the endogenous drosophila tra protein, then this complex could bind to specific sequences in the female-specific exon of dsx pre-mrna. this would promote its inclusion in mature dsxf mrna, which encodes the dsxf protein that establishes female development. this expectation was confirmed at the molecular level.

the effect of sciara tra <dig> protein on the splicing control of drosophila dsx pre-mrna was studied in transgenic drosophila xx flies mutant for tra- <dig> and expressing the sciara tra <dig> protein . the inducible hs-gal <dig> driver was used to express the sotra <dig> transgene. xx pseudomales yw/w; dftrix,tra-2/tra-2b; sotra2/hs-gal <dig> were produced at 25°c . after the hatching of the adults the flies were divided into two populations; one was maintained at 25°c  and one subjected to heat-shock pulses  to induce the expression of the sotra <dig> transgene. total rna was extracted and used in rt-pcr to determine the splicing pattern of the endogenous dsx primary transcript. rp <dig>  which codes for the constitutive ribosomal protein  <dig>  <cit> , was used as an rt-pcr control. at 25°c, the four transgenic lines only expressed the male dsx mrna isoform ; this was to be expected since they lack the endogenous tra- <dig> function and do not express the sotra <dig> transgene. after the heat shocks, however, these transgenic lines expressed the female dsx mrna isoform . two amplicons were detected. the smaller one  corresponded to the female dsxf mrna. the larger amplicon  was to be expected if the intron  <dig> were retained . the cloning and sequencing of both fragments confirmed these suppositions. these results were not the consequence of the heat-shocks since their brothers trix,tra2/tra-2b; sotra2/hs-gal4) expressing the sotra <dig> transgene did not express the female dsx mrna isoform . negative controls for all these pcr reactions produced no amplicons . thus, the sciara tra <dig> protein is able to promote the female-specific splicing of the drosophila dsx pre-mrna.

whereas the expression of sciara tra <dig> protein in the xx pseudomales produced their feminisation, its expression in their xy normal brothers mutant for tra- <dig> did not affect their normal male development. this different effect is explained by the presence of tra protein in the xx pseudomales and its absence in xy normal males. the drosophila tra protein seems to lack an rna binding domain, thus its influence in female development is exerted at the level of its interaction  with other proteins carrying rna-binding domains, such as tra <dig> . therefore, the sciara tra <dig> protein would form a complex with the endogenous drosophila tra protein to promote the female-specific splicing of the drosophila dsx pre-mrna.

the feminisation produced by the sciara tra <dig> protein was, however, partial, indicating that the function of this protein in drosophila was incomplete. there are two possible explanations for this. it might be due to an insufficient quantity of sciara tra <dig> protein being produced in the drosophila transgenic flies; it was necessary to restrict the amount of sciara tra <dig> protein that was expressed since the production of any greater amount is lethal. however, although this possibility cannot be rejected outright it seems unlikely since drosophila xx flies with a single dose of tra- <dig> develop as normal females; i.e., a single dose of the endogenous tra- <dig> gene supplies enough drosophila tra <dig> protein for normal female development to be followed. alternatively, the interaction between the endogenous drosophila tra protein and the transgenic sciara tra <dig> protein might be affected such that the drosophilatra-sciaratra <dig> complex is less efficient than the drosophilatra-tra <dig> complex at inducing the female-specific splicing of the endogenous drosophila dsx pre-mrna. this explanation agrees with the presence of the aberrant spliced dsxf mrna isoform in xx pseudomales expressing the sciara tra <dig> protein in addition to the normally spliced dsxf mrna. note that this isoform contains intron  <dig>  the target where the tra-tra <dig> complex binds to promote its inclusion into mature dsxf mrna  <cit> . further, the retention of intron  <dig> does not appear to be the consequence of any general trouble in the splicing of dsx pre-mrna since intron  <dig>  is normally spliced.

this aberrant dsxf mrna isoform has been also found in drosophila xx pseudomales mutant for the endogenous tra gene and expressing the anastrepha tra protein, whereas drosophila xx flies with different doses of the endogenous tra and tra- <dig> genes do not show this abnormally spliced dsxf mrna isoform  <cit> . with respect to the proposed inefficient interaction between the endogenous drosophila tra protein and the transgenic sciara tra <dig> protein, the high degree of divergence between the sciara and the drosophila tra <dig> proteins should be noted. this divergence was mainly observed in the rs domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. hence, the interaction between the sciara tra <dig> protein and the drosophila tra protein might be impeded as a consequence of changes accumulated in these proteins after the sciara and drosophila phylogenetic lineages separated. these results suggest that tra and tra <dig> proteins co-evolved to exert their functions in sex determination. to this respect, it is worth mentioning that the d. virilis tra- <dig> gene can fully replace the endogenous tra- <dig> function of d. melanogaster for normal female sexual development  <cit> . the similarity between the d. melanogaster and d. virilis tra- <dig> proteins is  <dig> %  <cit> , whereas the similarity between the d. melanogaster and s. ocellaris tra- <dig> proteins is  <dig> % .

CONCLUSIONS
the transformer- <dig> genes of both sciaridae species encode a single protein in both sexes that shares the characteristics of the transformer- <dig> proteins of other insects. these proteins showed conserved sex-determination function in drosophila; i.e., they were able to form a complex with the endogenous drosophila transformer protein that controls the female-specific splicing of the drosophila doublesex pre-mrna. however, it appears that the complex formed between the drosophila transformer protein and the sciara transformer- <dig> protein is less effective at inducing the female-specific splicing of the endogenous drosophila doublesex pre-mrna than the drosophilatransformer-transformer <dig> complex. this suggests the existence of species-specific co-evolution of the transformer and transformer- <dig> proteins.
