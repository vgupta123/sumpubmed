BACKGROUND
typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by salmonella enterica serotype typhi with  <dig> million of new cases registered annually worldwide despite various vaccination programs  <cit> . the prevalence of hepatobiliar system involvement is considered in 1–26% of patients with typhoid fever  <cit> .

broad-spectrum fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice for the treatment of typhoid fever  <cit>  inhibiting even fastidious intracellular pathogens in therapeutic concentrations readily achievable in body fluids and tissues  <cit> . despite the antimicrobial treatment almost 1–6% of infected patients become chronic carriers  <cit>  shedding bacteria in their stools and urine for a varying period of time.

one possibility to devise new strategies in treatment of bacterial gastrointestinal infections seems to be the application of probiotics as an adjunct to chemotherapy. probiotic strains are defined as live microorganisms which, when consumed in appropriate amounts in the food, confer a health benefit on the host  <cit> . a number of clinical trials with controversial results have been performed with probiotics in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections, caused by rotavirus and clostridium difficile  <cit> . in the management of helicobacter pylori infection probiotics in combination with antibiotic treatment have been reported to be successful  <cit> .

we applied a new probiotic lactobacillus fermentum me- <dig>  dsm  <dig>   <cit>  with high antimicrobial activity, particularly against gram negative pathogens  <cit> . besides, me- <dig> has considerable resistance to several reactive oxygen species  and possesses substantial antioxidative activity demonstrated by expression of manganese superoxide dismutase  <cit> .

for experimental investigation of salmonella typhi infection a mouse model is reliable and it has been successfully applied also in earlier studies  <cit> . the infection due to s. enterica serotype typhimurium in mice resembles human typhoid fever with extra-intestinal granulomatous lesions in different organs  <cit> .

the aim of the current study was to detect whether in experimental s. typhimurium infection the probiotic me- <dig> in combination with fluoroquinolone therapy would eradicate s. typhimurium from host, prevent the development of liver and spleen granulomas and improve the indices of oxidative stress in the ileum mucosa.

RESULTS
in vitro tests
the mic values of ofloxacin  to s. typhimurium were  <dig>  μg/ml and to me- <dig>  <dig> μg/ml. when the s. typhimurium and me- <dig> were tested together a six-fold decrease in the mic of ofx from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg/ml was observed with both applied methods .

experimental infection
all but two animals from s. typhimurium group  survived up to the end of the experiment. the survival rate in gr <dig> was 91% and in other groups 100% on day  <dig>  as demonstrated in table  <dig> by day  <dig> in gr <dig> mice, challenged with s. typhimurium, the viable bacteria were isolated from the ileum, blood and the liver . the administration of ofx  and me- <dig>  significantly reduced the number of mice with viable s. typhimurium in the ileum . besides, s. typhimurium was still cultivated from blood and liver of some animals of gr <dig> and gr <dig>  while, viable s. typhimurium were not found in any of investigated sites applying the combination of ofx and me- <dig> .

 <dig> p =  <dig>  gr <dig> vs gr <dig> and gr <dig> vs gr <dig> spleen granulomas

the frequent histopathological findings were the granulomas in liver and spleen, detected in more than half of the untreated animals . in the spleen  the treatment with ofx as single and in combination with me- <dig> were superior to treatment by me- <dig> alone . the number of mice with liver granulomas was significantly reduced by application of the ofx and me- <dig> combination as compared to ofx alone .

lactobacilli were present in terminal ileum of all investigated animals . numerous colonies of l. fermentum as species were detected in animals of gr <dig> and gr <dig>  however, we could not distinguish the presence of the strain l. fermentum me- <dig>  a somewhat increased count and smaller variation of lactobacilli was detected in groups of animals treated with l. fermentum me- <dig> . no translocation of lactobacilli into blood and liver was detected. in all experimental groups the higher total counts of intestinal lactobacilli were associated with the absence of granulomas in the liver .

the indices of oxidative stress e.g. the level of lpo and gssg/gsh were higher in mice challenged with s. typhimurium as compared to control group  . the lpo values were reduced significantly  in both treatments: with me- <dig> alone  and in combination with ofx  as compared with that of ofx .

discussion
we have previously shown that me- <dig> has antagonistic activity against s. enterica serovar typhimurium as well as in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo mice model  <cit> .

in this experimental study we explored the influence of combined per oral treatment with ofx and l. fermentum me- <dig> to s. typhimurium infection. the infection mimics human typhoid fever characterised by specific granulomatous lesions in various organs  <cit> . in the current study the granulomas were detected in liver and spleen of s. typhimurium challenged mice.

although according to in vitro tests s. typhimurium strain was susceptible to ofx, the treatment did not eradicate s. typhimurium from ileum, blood and liver. by contrast, ofx combined with probiotic me- <dig> completely eradicated viable s. typhimurium from investigated sites and prevented the formation of spleen granulomas, at the same time significantly reducing the presence of liver granulomas. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a lactobacillus probiotic in combination with a fluoroquinolone has been shown to exert beneficial effect on the treatment of infectious granulomatous inflammation.

we observed an interesting difference between spleen and liver in the prevention of the granulomas during combinative therapy of s. typhimurium infection: the number of mice with liver granulomas was higher than the corresponding data of spleen. obviously, this is due to the more expressed immune-competence of spleen as compared to liver.

the limitation of our study was that we did not differentiate between the l. fermentum me- <dig> strain and any indigenous lactobacillus strains present in the mice gut during the experiment. however, under the combinative treatment with l. fermentum me- <dig> and ofloxacin besides the eradication of viable s. typhimurium the significant reduction of granulomas in liver and their total absence in spleen was found.

concerning the application of probiotics in gastrointestinal infections, the exact mechanism of action is not known yet. four possible mechanisms can be suggested. first, it has been shown that lactobacilli produce several substances like antimicrobials, lactic and non-lactic acids, hydrogen peroxide which enables to inhibit or kill pathogens  <cit> . second, in the gut lactobacilli seemingly compete with the pathogen for the adhesion sites and nutritional sources  <cit> . third, lactobacilli usually cause the immune-modulation of the host increasing the resistance against pathogens and fourth, they are able to inhibit the production of bacterial toxins  <cit> . all abovementioned factors seemingly might be involved in the eradication of salmonella typhimurium infection.

in the mice model the l. fermentum me- <dig> apparently suppressed salmonella typhimurium due to previously established high antimicrobial activity and production of both lactic and acetic acids and generation of h2o <dig>  <cit> . this was in accordance with the current in vitro tests, where mic values of ofx to s. typhimurium in combination with me- <dig> decreased even six-fold.

remarkably, in mice with high numbers of intestinal lactobacilli the granulomas of liver and spleen were not found. probably the increased counts of total lactobacilli inhibited the spread of s. typhimurium into organs and prevented the formation of granulomas. this could have been associated with hyperplasia of lymph nodes in ileum, found previously after administration of me- <dig>  <cit>  and involved also in the present study. 

the absence of translocation of s. typhimurium and intestinal lactobacilli as much as the reduced invasion of s. typhimurium into tested organs could be explained by improved anti-oxidative status of gut mucosa. during the intracellular infection phagocytes produce reactive oxygen species , important for killing the pathogen. though the formation of ros is reported to be induced also by fluoroquinolones, their role in the antibacterial action is not clearly understood  <cit> . the excessive amounts of ros damage the collateral intestinal epithelial cells and the superoxide compound was responsible for the generation of the granulomatous lesions limiting the spread of infection  <cit> . in the current study it was shown that the administration of this antioxidative probiotic to infected mice significantly reduced lpo values of ileum mucosa in comparison with the gut of the untreated and treated with ofx animals. thus, the application of l. fermentum me- <dig> suppressed the excessive oxidative stress indices and could have improved the oxidative state of the gut mucosal tissue. apparently, the neutralisation of the produced superoxides by superoxide dismutase of me- <dig> was one of the putative mechanisms in prevention of the granulomatous lesions  <cit> . recently, the concept of oxidative stress has been advanced as "a disruption of redox signalling and control"  <cit> . this emphasises the impact of glutathione and its redox ratio in intestinal cells during s. typhimurium infection  <cit> . in the current study the addition of me- <dig> to ofx reduced glutathione redox ratio by improving the oxidative status in ileum.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the antimicrobial and antioxidative probiotic l. fermentum me- <dig> combined with ofloxacin enhances the eradication of experimental s. typhimurium infection. these observations on probiotic and antimicrobial co-action could serve as basis to develop new strategies for treatment of invasive bacterial infections of the gut.
