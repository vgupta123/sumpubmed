BACKGROUND
only  <dig> - 2 % of angiosperm species are known to be halophytes, able to live and reproduce in saline soils  <cit> . the rarity of salt tolerance is unsurprising considering it is a costly and complex ecological strategy; halophytes may have modifications to many parts of their physiology and anatomy in order to combat the damaging effects of osmotic and metabolic stress, which can cause impaired growth and reproduction . however, halophytes are found in a wide range of angiosperm families and they occupy diverse habitats worldwide.

salt tolerance has also clearly evolved multiple times in angiosperms  <cit> . the evolutionary patterns of salt tolerance in plants have been studied in detail in only a few taxonomic groups, and these studies have revealed two very different patterns of salt tolerance evolution. in one well-studied group, the chenopods , salt tolerance appears to be phylogenetically conserved  <cit> , arising only once or twice in the history of the group, then being retained in a large proportion of species in the family. in contrast, a study on the grass family  estimated that there have been at least  <dig> origins of salt tolerance within the family  <cit> . most of these inferred origins were near the terminal taxa  of the phylogeny, suggesting multiple shallow origins, each giving rise to only one or a few salt tolerant species. the pattern of salt tolerance evolution inferred in the poaceae is interesting because it suggests that, at least in the grasses, salt tolerance has evolved repeatedly in a range of lineages, despite the complexity of salt tolerance adaptations. however, the observation that salt tolerance does not persist over long evolutionary timescales in the grasses may indicate that while salt tolerance is easy to gain, it is also frequently lost through trait reversal or extinction, implying that there are costs associated with the adoption of salt tolerance.

these two different phylogenetic patterns suggest very different macroevolutionary dynamics. salt tolerance is highly conserved in the chenopods, with a large number of salt tolerant species arising from only a few independent origins. but in the grasses, salt tolerance is highly labile, in the sense that it is gained and lost relatively frequently. which, if either, of these patterns is observed in other families of angiosperms? to answer this question, we use a phylogenetic comparative approach to investigate and characterize patterns of halophyte diversity and evolution among angiosperm families.

halophytes use a variety of physiological and anatomical traits to survive in saline habitats, and these traits can vary between species. some halophytes exhibit complex anatomical modifications like salt glands or hairs, but most halophytes rely on osmotic regulation, modifying existing physiological mechanisms to mitigate salinity levels within the plant  <cit> . these strategies can also vary amongst closely related halophytes and among halophytes that occupy similar habitats, for example the differential presence of succulence among closely related chenopods  <cit>  or salt glands among phylogenetically diverse mangrove species  <cit> . instead of identifying specific environmental or physiological differences between halophytes, we focus on the broad distribution of salt tolerance as an ecological strategy amongst angiosperms, at the family and species levels. we first examine how halophytes are distributed among the angiosperm families, identifying any families that have more or less halophytes than expected by chance. then we use a number of phylogenetic measures to analyze the observed evolutionary patterns of salt tolerance in a sample of  <dig> angiosperm families. this sample includes large families with many known halophytes, including families with both more and less halophytes than expected.

RESULTS
halophyte diversity
we found that the observed distribution of halophytes across angiosperm families was significantly nonrandom . of the  <dig> families included in the taxonomic analysis,  <dig> families have one or more known halophytes . we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> families have significantly more halophytes than expected by chance; examples include amaranthaceae, poaceae and rhizophoraceae .  <dig> families have significantly fewer halophytes than expected by chance, for example acanthaceae, lamiaceae and fabaceae.

evolutionary patterns
for each family analyzed, we created a family subtree that included all tips from a large angiosperm phylogeny  <cit>  belonging to each family according to genbank taxonomy . in the  <dig> family subtrees analyzed, we observed a range of evolutionary patterns of salt tolerance . in general, evolutionary gains of salt tolerance appeared close to the tips, across the family subtrees. one measure used to assess the evolutionary patterns of salt tolerance across families was the number of tips per origin , the average number of taxa descending from each inferred evolutionary origin of salt tolerance in a family. the median value of noto across all  <dig> families analyzed was  <dig>  and nineteen of the family subtrees had a noto value less than two. this observation indicates that the inferred gains of salt tolerance in these family subtrees typically give rise to less than two descendant halophyte tips. in contrast, a few families  had higher noto values than the other families, meaning that each gain of salt tolerance in these families is deeper in the subtrees and leads to comparatively larger clades of halophytes than observed in the other families analyzed. tamaricaceae was the only family in our sample with significantly fewer salt tolerance gains than expected given the number of known halophytes and halophytic taxa were significantly clustered.fig.  <dig> family subtrees for a sample of six of the families analyzed with significant noto and/or sscd values. inferred gains of salt tolerance  are marked on each family with black circles. tips in the subtrees identified as halophytes are marked in black in the ring around the subtree. the subtrees represent a) amaranthaceae, b) apiaceae, c) brassicaceae, d) cucurbitaceae, e) cyperaceae, and f) euphorbiaceae. all  <dig> subtrees included in the analysis are presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  subtree plots were created using the “diversitree” package  <cit> 



over half of the families analyzed had a similar phylogenetic distribution to the pattern found in the grasses  <cit> . in these families, given the observed number of halophytes in each of the family subtrees, either 1) salt tolerance has evolved more times than expected under a brownian motion model  and/or 2) clades of halophytes are less clustered than expected under brownian motion model of trait evolution , see methods) . when comparing with the results from the angiosperm diversity analysis, we found that this labile evolutionary pattern is found in families with varying proportions of halophytes, including those with more, fewer, and within the expected number of halophytes based on family size.table  <dig> results of taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses for a sample of  <dig> angiosperm families

family and order names are based on apg iii  <cit> . family size is the mean estimated number of species in the family reported on the apg iii website  <cit> . the halophytes column lists the number of known halophytes species in each family. family subtree size represents the number of taxa in the phylogenetic tree used for analysis, and halophytes in subtree is the number of known halophytes included in each family subtree. the halophytes sampled in subtree represents the percent of known halophytes that are present in each family subtree. the taxonomic pattern column identifies families with more or fewer halophytes than expected by chance based on the taxonomic analysis . the results of the metrics used to distinguish evolutionary patterns of salt tolerance are presented. for the number of tips per origin , p-values represent whether the average number of halophytes arising from each inferred gain of salt tolerance is smaller expected under brownian motion . for the sum of sister clade differences , p-values represent whether halophytes are less clustered than expected under brownian motion . test statistics that are significantly different to the null model are presented in bold. significant results for tamaricaceae are italicized to highlight that this is the only significantly conserved pattern of salt tolerance, where significantly more tips per gain and a significantly smaller sscd



correlation tests suggest that there is no significant association between taxon sampling proportion and estimates of sscd  or noto  estimates. the proportion of halophytic taxa in the subtrees is not correlated with sscd  or noto p-values .

discussion
using a list of known halophytes assembled from a range of published sources, we find that one-third of angiosperm families contain species reported as being able to live in saline conditions. we show that the distribution of salt tolerant species among angiosperm families is not consistent with a random distribution, and that some families have significantly more halophytes than expected given the family size, while others have significantly fewer salt tolerant species.

not only does the proportion of halophytes differ between families, but the phylogenetic distribution of salt tolerance within families also varies. specifically, we set out to test whether the pattern of salt tolerance in grasses  – with many, shallow, scattered gains – was also found in other families. a few families show the opposite pattern, where salt tolerance has been gained deep in the family and retained by a large proportion of descendants  <cit> ; examples include tamaricaceae which contains the highly salt tolerant salt cedars and many species with specialized anatomical traits like salt glands  <cit> ; amaranthaceae, which includes the halophyte-rich groups formerly classified under chenopodiaceae; and rhizophoraceae, which contains many mangrove species. however, over half of the families analyzed show a pattern like the grasses, consistent with many, shallow gains of salt tolerance. the fact that we find this labile pattern of salt tolerance evolution in a phylogenetically diverse set of families with different proportions of halophytes suggests that the observed pattern of many independent gains of salt tolerance is not simply explained by the proportion of halophytes in a group.

one limitation of broad comparative analyses like this one is that we can only gain information from data on known halophytes and sequenced angiosperm taxa. specifically, the limitations in data used in this study come from two main sources. one problem is the incidence of false negatives in the halophyte list. most published lists of halophytes are based on observational data, and there are likely to be other salt tolerant species that have not been described in the literature or included in published lists. for example, there are likely many species living in non-saline habitats that have the capacity for salt tolerance but have not yet been formally tested. one solution to improve future analyses is to move away from list-based methods drawn from single species experiments and observational data. for example, it may be possible for phylogenetic studies to contribute to the identification of salt tolerance lineages, for example by using use phyloprediction  <cit>  or geochemical modeling to identify lineages that are likely to be salt tolerant  <cit> .

a second potential source of error is incomplete phylogenetic sampling. the phylogeny used in this study includes about 20 % of known angiosperm species, so there are some known salt tolerant taxa that are not included in this tree . correlation tests did not indicate any consistent effect of the proportion of total species sampled in a family or of the proportion of halophytes in the subtrees on the results of noto and sscd, suggesting that sampling proportion does not significantly influence the results of our analysis. increased sampling is unlikely to change the overarching pattern because salt tolerant taxa in most family subtrees with significant noto and sscd are sparsely distributed and many of the inferred gains are distantly related on the trees . this pattern suggest that in most cases adding more salt tolerant taxa is likely to either increase the total number of inferred salt tolerance gains  or maintain the number of inferred gains . however, there are some clades, for example in cyperaceae and amaranthaceae, with denser groups of halophytes, where the number of inferred gains relative to the number of halophytes is more likely to be reduced by adding more halophytes . similarly, removing identified halophytes with only low or seasonal tolerance to salinity could in some cases increase phylogenetic clustering of halophytes, reducing the number of inferred gains , or break up some clades, possibly increasing the estimated number of gains. based on the extant pattern of halophytes, our analysis suggests that salt tolerance has been gained at least  <dig> times in the  <dig> families analyzed. and if we assume that each of the other angiosperm families that contain halophytes also represents at least one independent gain of salt tolerance, there are likely to be  <dig> additional gains or more across the angiosperms.

our results are consistent with the findings of two previous group-specific studies on phylogenetic patterns of salt tolerance  <cit> . we infer over  <dig> gains of salt tolerance within the grass family subtree, and confirm that halophytes are more phylogenetically dispersed than expected under brownian motion. we also demonstrate that the amaranthaceae has relatively high numbers of species per inferred gain, indicating a more conserved pattern of salt tolerance evolution compared to the other families in the analysis. while we estimate that salt tolerance is significantly less clustered than brownian motion in amaranthaceae, this result appears to be driven by about one-third of the family with notably fewer halophytes than the rest of the tree .

given that salt tolerance may involve many anatomical, physiological and life history modifications, it may seem surprising that it has evolved so many times in such a wide range of lineages. however, it has been suggested that other stress tolerance strategies involving complex sets of ecophysiological traits have also evolved multiple times . one explanation for how salt tolerance has evolved multiple times is that the required physiological or anatomical changes can build on precursor traits acquired earlier in the history of the lineages. a well-studied example of how complex physiological traits can build on precursor traits is c <dig> photosynthesis in the grasses  <cit> . in a few angiosperm families researchers have inferred many independent evolutionary origins of c <dig> photosynthesis, a specialized form of photosynthesis often associated with arid-adapted lineages  <cit> , which requires many biochemical and anatomical modifications. lineages with a higher proportion of vascular bundle sheath cells have a higher frequency of evolution of c <dig> photosynthesis, suggesting that some types of foliar anatomy facilitate the transition to c <dig>  <cit> . similarly, if salt tolerance builds on existing physiological or anatomical traits, then a lineage with these traits may have a higher likelihood of giving rise to halophytic species. for example, c <dig> grass lineages are more likely to contain halophytes than c <dig> lineages, possibly because c <dig> photosynthesis allows more efficient water use and therefore limits the impact of salinity by reducing the uptake of ions and limiting the effects of osmotic stress  <cit> .

although the idea of evolutionary precursors may explain why some lineages develop salinity tolerance more often than others, the question remains: why are salt tolerant lineages often found as singletons on the phylogeny or in small clades? there are several broad explanations for this pattern, which are not mutually exclusive. one explanation is that the observed distribution of halophytes could reflect patterns of change in land salinity over time. although some saline areas are long lived , in some areas salinity can vary over small spatial scales or shift on a seasonal basis  <cit> . if lineages are rapidly responding to changing salinity, this could partly explain why we infer mostly shallow gains of salt tolerance that give rise to only one or a few extant halophytes. however, recent origins of saline habitats is unlikely to provide a general explanation for the multiple recent gains of salt tolerance in many families, because some saline habitats are stable over long evolutionary time periods, so should provide persistent habitat for saline specialists.

another explanation for why there are so many small clades of halophytes is that salt tolerance may be a costly ecological strategy that is relatively easy to gain but difficult to maintain. for example, high plasticity could enable some lineages to transition into harsh or novel habitats over evolutionarily short time scales  <cit> . however, maintaining a strategy like salt tolerance could be physiologically costly, for example due to the cost of producing osmoprotectants or increasing investment in reactive oxygen species scavenging and antioxidant production . the high physiological cost of salt tolerance could lead to increased extinction rates in halophytes, or high reversal rates if lineages that invest less in salt tolerance mechanisms have a competitive advantage. this scenario could lead to an extant pattern of many shallow gains of salt tolerance dispersed across the phylogeny. some research suggests that the more salt tolerant a species, the less competitive it is in less saline or non-saline environment  <cit> , although the generality of these claims are disputed  <cit> . reduced competitive ability may threaten the persistence of halophytes if land salinity subsides, and halophytes may not be ecologically competitive when transitioning back into a non-saline environment  <cit> , which could lead to local extinction or the loss of salt tolerance. however, the lower competitive ability may not always be a direct result of salt tolerance  <cit> , and high salinity tolerance may even confer a competitive advantage for some species in non-saline habitats. for example, salt cedars  are highly salt tolerant, yet they are invasive in some non-saline and low-saline riparian habitats. salt cedar populations are capable of displacing natives by using more water and excreting salt into the soil, creating a toxic environment for non-salt tolerant native species  <cit> .

it is unlikely that either changes in land salinity patterns or the cost of salt tolerance can fully explain why salt tolerance has evolved many times and why halophytes are often found as singletons and in small clades. and it has been suggested that, in general, the transition into different habitats and the evolution of ecological traits may be highly context dependent  <cit> . identifying the phylogenetic patterns of salt tolerance represents an important step towards understanding salt tolerance evolution. we hope that reporting results in the context of angiosperm families will be useful for more detailed studies in future on the environmental and physiological aspects of salt tolerance evolution in different lineages. in future it would be interesting to explore the role that related traits, order of trait acquisition, and climatic history have played in the observed patterns of salt tolerance evolution, as has been examined for c <dig> photosynthesis  <cit>  and freezing tolerance  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
salt tolerance in plants is an interesting case study in macroevolution  <cit> . salt tolerance is an ecological strategy that often involves complex physiological features. halophytes are rare, yet they are found in a diverse set of taxonomic groups. our analysis shows that in a range of angiosperm families, salt tolerance has been gained a surprising number of times and that these transitions are shallow and spread out near the tips of the phylogeny. this suggests that while the evolutionary pattern of salt tolerance varies across angiosperm families, it seems that salt tolerance can evolve frequently in many different genetic backgrounds. this result is intriguing, given how difficult it has to been to manipulate the salt tolerance of commercial crop varieties  <cit> , but the frequent evolution of salt tolerance may give hope that many plant lineages can build on existing physiological and anatomical traits to develop increased tolerance of environmental salinity.
