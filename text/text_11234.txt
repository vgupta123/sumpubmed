BACKGROUND
although it has long been known that cellular memory, or epigenetic states, can be created by emergent properties of regulatory or metabolic networks , the full implications of this type of inheritance have only recently been understood. to date, pertinent studies focused mainly on phenomena related to chromatin structure and dna methylation, rnai and other post-transcriptional gene silencing processes, and prions. however, virtually any physiological process can adopt a bistable  behavior, as defined by the ability to adopt two  stable states rather than a range of intermediate states, provided that a positive feedback loop exists  within the system  <cit> . the bistability may sometimes be associated with hysteresis, i.e., the ability of the system to maintain, in a sustained manner, a particular state despite the fact that the stimulus initiating this state is no longer present or is below the level that initially activated the system  <cit> . in some cases, the hysteresis is sufficiently dominant to permit faithful transmission of the different states during mitosis and even meiosis, thus appearing as an epigenetic phenomenon  <cit> .

in the light of these concepts, alternative inheritable regulatory states were designated  based on previous descriptions of regulatory or metabolic networks, permitting the definition of new types of inheritance units, the 'toggle switch' and the 'positive feedback switch'. more recently, mathematical models defined the conditions in which a system endowed with positive autoregulation can present bistability  <cit> . however, most studies on bistable regulatory states are presently performed with a few well-known systems  <cit> , including the lactose operon, the lambda lysogenic/lytic decision switch, and the xenopus mos map kinase cascade. other relevant models are necessary for the comprehension of these phenomena.

fungi are an excellent source of well-defined bistable and multistable processes associated with hysteresis . in yeasts, such phenomena are quite common and are called phenotypic switches  <cit>  or prions  <cit> . in filamentous fungi, bistable phenomena seem to be particularly prevalent, as one-third of the species show at least one example of these  <cit> . in most cases investigated in filamentous fungi, bistability results from the appearance and subsequent spread of cytoplasmic and infectious factors. apart from the het-s and the crippled growth determinants of podospora anserina, their molecular nature and their roles remain unknown. het-s is a prion  <cit>  and the crippled growth determinant seems to result from a positive autoregulation of a signal transduction cascade  <cit> . the widespread recognition of these infectious factors in fungi is probably due to the ease with which they are detected. the syncytial structure of the mycelium facilitates the propagation of factors from cell to cell. usually, the presence of the infectious element results in a modification of thallic characteristics, such as fertility or morphology, and is thus easily scored visually as sectors in which the mycelium displays different properties.

in the filamentous ascomycete nectria haematoccoca, two bistable phenomena have been described  <cit> . n. haematoccoca is the teleomorph of fusarium solani, a fungus encountered throughout the world as both saprophyte and pathogen. n. haematoccoca produces naphthoquinones exhibiting biological activities. production of naphthoquinones is regulated by genetic and environmental but also epigenetic factors. the thallus of this species, observed just after ascospore germination, is a dense, grayish aerial mycelium, called normal. two kinds of morphological modification  frequently and randomly appear in the growth margin of the thallus as small brown areas in which hyphal elongation is reduced and secretion of pigments is drastically increased . once initiated, the modifications spread and progressively invade the margin of the culture, with a speed that dictates their form . the new growth forms can be perpetuated with large pieces of mycelium excised from the growing margin of affected mycelia. the resulting modified subcultures, called zis  and zia , grow slowly and are pigmented in brown. however, fragmentation of a modified culture permits the restoration of the normal morphology in a variable proportion of subcultures  <cit> , showing that zis and zia cultures are probably mosaics of infected and uninfected hyphae. each modification can be specifically transmitted to normal cultures by contamination experiments, as shown in figure 1c for secteurs. the tangential propagation of the new growth forms is thus due to the transmission through hyphal fusion  of specific infectious cytoplasmic determinants, called σ for the secteur and α for the anneau.

mutagenesis experiments of wild-type conidiospores demonstrated that both the secteur and the anneau are under the control of nuclear genes  <cit> . in these early mutageneses, several kinds of mutation were detected. five mutations prevent the expression of both the secteur and anneau, either spontaneously or after inoculation. they differed from wild type in producing more aerial mycelium, lacking pigmentation, and suppressing the sexual stage through self-fertilization. they mapped to at least four loci. since this type of mutation prevents the generation of both infectious factors, they are now designated nas mutants .

several mutations that specifically prevent the formation of anneaux were also selected  <cit> . the two different types of mutations recovered, a and a*, suggested that the anneau is under the control of a unique but complex locus. all a and a* mutations map to the same locus, ans . mutants carrying the a mutations are unable to generate the α factor, since they never present anneau morphology and cannot be infected by that factor. mutants carrying the a* mutations never show anneaux, spontaneously or after contamination, but display a red color. surprisingly, when used as donor in contamination with the wild type as recipient, these mutants are able to trigger anneaux in 100% of attempts, showing that these a* mutants carry the α factor constitutively. it is noteworthy that the phenotype of a* mutants suggests that the mere presence of this factor is sufficient to promote a red color but is insufficient to alter growth.

to date, only one mutation that specifically prevents secteur formation has been described  <cit> . this s* <dig>  mutant acts similarly to a* mutation in that it entails a red pigmentation  and specifically prevents the expression of the secteur, although it possesses the σ determinant throughout the thallus. this property is shown in figure 1c, by the ability of small inocula harvested in the red s* thallus to induce secteurs on growing recipient mycelia lacking the σ determinant.

because of the similar properties of anneaux and secteurs, we decided to screen for more mutations that specifically prevent secteur formation, to determine if s mutations  could be obtained. to this end, we developed novel mutagenesis procedures permitting the recovery of mutations that specifically prevent secteur development. most were nas mutations. however, a few s* alleles and two s alleles  were obtained. genetic analysis suggested that the σ factor, like the α factor, is under the specific control of a single complex genetic locus. molecular analysis of the s <dig> allele, obtained by insertional mutagenesis, permitted the cloning and characterization of the ses locus. as expected from the genetic data, the locus is complex and encompasses two linked genes, one of which has similarity with putative esterase/lipase/thioesterase enzymes. these data provide evidence that two linked genes could generate a bistable differentiation.

RESULTS
selection and genetic characterization of mutants affected in the expression of the secteur phenomenon
to increase the number of mutants affected in secteur expression, we decided to use a strategy based on the recovery of fast-growing sectors after mutagenesis of the slow-growing zis cultures . we recovered  <dig> independent mutants , with a large majority of nas mutants . eleven mutants were specifically affected in secteur expression. ten exhibited an s* phenotype identical to that of the s* <dig> strain. one mutant, s <dig>  had a wild-type phenotype, except that it was unable to express the secteur, spontaneously or after contamination tests .

genetic analysis of the mutants defines a complex locus involved in secteur expression
the s <dig> mutant and five s* mutants were initially crossed with the i4mod reference strain. all behaved as single mutants, with about 50% wild type and 50% mutant type in the progeny . in some progeny, the s* and s <dig> mutations were recombined with the i4mod markers. these strains were kept for further crosses. crossing s <dig> with s* <dig> or crossing the new s* mutants with s <dig> and with s* <dig> yielded progeny that were mostly segregants, with the parental phenotypes in a ratio 1: <dig> and few segregants with the wild-type phenotype. their frequency ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the progeny , indicating that mutations affecting the secteur were closely linked. in order to determine dominance/recessivity relationships of the mutated and wild-type alleles, forced heterokaryons were produced by pairing some mutants and wild-type strains marked with auxotrophic mutations . the s1/+, s*789/+, and s*84/+ prototrophic mycelia were grayish and able to differentiate secteurs, as did the control heterokaryon, which carried only the auxotrophic markers. thus, the wild-type allele was dominant over its mutated counterparts. combinations of s* mutants with s <dig> gave rise to heterokaryotic wild-type mycelia, indicating that complementation occurred. in contrast, no complementation was observed in pairings involving two different s* alleles.

the simplest interpretation of these results is that s <dig> and s* mutations could affect two different linked genes or two separate domains of a multifunctional protein encoded by a large gene. however, due to the low representation of heterokaryotic cells  determined in previous studies  <cit> , one must carefully interpret these data, deduced from the characteristics of the prototrophic heterokaryotic mycelium.

insertional mutagenesis identified the ses locus
since the s <dig> mutant allele appears recessive to the wild type in balanced heterokaryons, we tried to clone the ses locus by complementation using the sib selection strategy  <cit> . although two different cosmid banks, xsg and xn , were used, none of the tested transformants exhibited secteurs. as an alternative strategy, we therefore used insertional mutagenesis, which can rapidly lead to the cloning of the relevant gene. transformation with a plasmid that carries a hygromycin b resistance marker was performed to identify new mutants affected in ses. however, because the contamination tests necessary for this screen were labor-intensive and time-consuming, we preferred the 61a <dig> strain as a recipient for transformation, since it expressed secteurs very early, and at high frequency, and never expressed anneaux  <cit> . as illustrated in figure 3a, the majority of transformants grown for  <dig> days at 18°c differentiated secteurs, so that few transformants had to be tested by contamination experiments for their secteur expression. during the course of these experiments, we also screened transformants harboring a variation in colony morphology or pigmentation . these phenotypes could be maintained from conidia isolation, showing that the transformation procedure was an effective approach in the creation of mutants. ten transformants among the  <dig> recovered failed to express the secteur. nine exhibited a nas phenotype. one was probably affected in the ses locus, as it was unable to differentiate secteurs, either spontaneously or after contamination tests. this transformant, called s <dig>  had a wild-type morphology and behaved as did the s <dig> mutant previously isolated.

the s <dig> transformant carries a dna fragment integrated in the ses locus
in order to prove that s <dig> carries integration in the ses locus, we crossed it with the wild-type  and s <dig> strains. when crossed with wt, the  <dig> tested ascospores segregated 1: <dig> for ability:inability to differentiate secteurs. as expected, hygromycin b resistance always cosegregated with the inability to differentiate secteurs. when s <dig> was crossed with the s <dig> strain, only seven ascospores among  <dig> were unable to express the secteur , indicating that s <dig> also mapped at the ses locus. overall, the data strongly suggested that s <dig> resulted from a single insertion at the ses locus.

to establish the integration pattern in s <dig>  southern blotting analysis was performed after digestion by clai, which did not cut the plasmid, and by bamhi, which cut once in the vector. the probe was the pan7- <dig> vector used for insertional mutagenesis. as shown in figure 4a, the number and intensity of hybridizing bands in clai digest reflected a complex integration event, with at least two integrated copies. southern blot analysis of  <dig> s progeny from an s <dig> × wild-type cross did not show segregation of the two integration sites , suggesting that the two integrated copies were linked. the size of the larger clai-fragment, li, was compatible with an entire copy of the vector, whereas the smaller, si, could be interpreted as a truncated copy. further analyses with other restriction enzymes and probes  established the restriction map of this region . the sequence of a region flanking si revealed that both li and si occurred at the same genomic site and were separated by a dna fragment of unknown origin .

molecular cloning of the ses locus
the restriction enzyme bamhi was used to recover the genomic sequence flanking li  along with part of the integrated pan7- <dig> vector. a part of flank <dig> was then used as a probe to screen the xn cosmid library. one hybridizing cosmid, xn31e <dig>  was identified and used to transform the s* <dig>  s* <dig>  s* <dig>  and s* <dig> mutants. most of the transformants recovered the ability to express the secteur, showing that the s* mutations are probably recessive. however, different phenotypes were observed . the 'mild s' exhibited the secteur altered in its propagation and maintenance, and the 's → s*' showed an s* phenotype beyond the secteur. the mild s was interpreted as having a reduced amount of σ in the modified areas because of insufficient expression of the transgene, and the s → s* type was probably due to transgene sorting. indeed, wild-type and s* nuclei could be recovered through the isolation of microconidia in such transformants, before expression of a secteur, indicating that the s → s* thalli had a heterokaryotic structure. after the development of a secteur, only the s* cells that were not affected in their growth in the presence of σ could grow, as previously observed for balanced heterokaryons  <cit> . interestingly, we also observed several transformants displaying an s phenotype . these might have resulted from an abnormal integration inactivating the ses locus. molecular analysis of five hygromycin-resistant  transformants  revealed two patterns of integration . the pattern exhibited by the four wild-type transformants was wild type, except for an additional band corresponding to the pmocosx vector. these transformants were thus interpreted as having integrated one copy of xn31e <dig> at the resident ses locus. the mild-s transformant pattern was more complex, showing additional bands and a difference in fragment stoichiometry, suggesting a complex integration. this is consistent with a reduced amount of σ hypothesized for mild-s transformants.

it is noteworthy that despite several attempts, transformation experiments done with the s <dig> mutant as a recipient did not yield any transformants able to express the secteur. this suggests that, contrary to the observations in balanced heterokaryons, s <dig> is dominant in partial diploids. dominance of s <dig> was indeed established through transformation . this dominance in diploids explains the failure to clone ses by complementation.

in order to further define the dna fragment complementing the recessive s* mutation, cosmid xn31e <dig> was subcloned into pbluescript and the plasmids were assayed for complementation. this yielded psecx <dig>  a plasmid carrying a  <dig> -kb xhoi fragment sufficient to confer secteur expression  with the same efficiency as did xn31e <dig> 

gene organization of the ses locus
a 9-kb-long region surrounding the integration site in the s <dig> strain was sequenced . one interesting feature of the sequenced region concerned the presence of several inverted repeats ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and organized in a symmetrical fashion . inspection of the sequences revealed four open reading frames  that were either larger than  <dig> amino acids or showed significant similarity with proteins in the databases . to begin with, we found an orf encoding a putative large protein of unknown function that is also detected in the complete genome sequences available for the other filamentous ascomycetes . this protein, nhhet-e-like, has a weak similarity  to the het-e protein of p. anserina, which has been shown to be involved in heterokaryon incompatibility  <cit> . on the other side of the insertion site, a partial orf of  <dig> amino acids carrying a prosite , short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases family signature, was detected and designated adhs. two additional orfs, sesa and sesb, were also identified. functional analysis revealed that only these two orfs were part of ses, each having a different role.

sesa is a 210-codon orf  with no homologue in the genomes of n. crassa, m. grisea, a. nidulans, or a. fumigatus. however, it is significantly similar  to the n terminus of a large putative protein of p. anserina of unknown function but with 46% identity and 60% similarity with the het-e protein in its c terminus . it is also similar to two orfs, of  <dig> and  <dig> codons, present in the genome of f. graminearum, with 41% identity and 54% similarity over  <dig> amino acids and 32% identity and 49% similarity over  <dig> amino acids, respectively . sesa is interrupted by pan7- <dig> in the s <dig> transformant, and sequence analysis of sesa in the s <dig> mutant showed a mutation at the end of the coding sequence, which changes a glycine into a glutamic acid . sesa was expressed because a 480-bp-long rt-pcr product was obtained by using the 3' race  procedure. the sequence of this product revealed that a polyadenylation signal existed  <dig> bp downstream from the sesa stop codon.

sesb, a 386-codon orf , is located on the opposite strand from sesa. sesb shows significant similarity with several putative proteins from filamentous ascomycetes  and animals . it does not show similarity with hemiascomycetous yeast orfs , basidiomycete orfs , or arabidopsis thaliana orfs. all the proteins similar to sesb show a significant prosite  esterase/lipase/thioesterase active site serine domain. the sequence of sesb in s <dig> s* <dig> s* <dig> s* <dig>  and s* <dig> revealed that in the four s* mutant alleles, sesb contains a single point mutation , but no mutation in the s <dig> mutant. in s* <dig>  s* <dig>  and s* <dig>  the mutations are missense mutations, and in s* <dig>  the mutation corresponds to a one-base addition resulting in a frameshift  <dig> bp upstream of the stop codon. none affected highly conserved residues of the esterase/lipase/thioesterase domain, suggesting that a functional protein was expressed in the mutants. the expression of sesb was also investigated with the 3'-race procedure. a 370-bp-long rt-pcr product was obtained, confirming that sesb is expressed. sequencing showed that a polyadenylation signal is used  <dig> bp downstream from the sesb stop codon. downstream of sesb is another potential short orf , encoding a putative peptide of  <dig> amino acids with no homologue in the databanks. to show that orf-c is not an exon of sesb, we cloned into pbluescript the  <dig> -kb-long smai fragment carrying only sesb, i.e., without orf-c or sesa. this yielded plasmid psecsm <dig> . its transformation in four different s* mutants showed that the insert restored the expression of the secteur. the molecular analysis of transformants showed that the integration was ectopic , supporting the hypothesis that sesb alone is per se a functional gene involved in secteur development.

since homologues of both sesa and sesb are present in the genomes of f. graminearum and p. anserina, we investigated whether the gene arrangement was conserved in these two species. in p. anserina, for which a single sesa homologue is found, the gene arrangement is not conserved, since sesa and sesb homologues are on two different contigs. in f. graminearum, the putative 201-amino-acid homologue of sesa that displays the lowest percentage of identity is not associated with any of the sesb homologues. on the contrary, the 214-amino-acid homologue of sesa that displays the highest identity is associated with a sesb homologue in the same order . this homologue is highly conserved between n. haematococca and f. graminearum  whereas the other f. graminearum homologues are less conserved . in f. graminearum, the inverted repeats  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are absent but the inverted repeat  <dig> is present. overall, these data suggest an evolutionary conservation of ses between n. haematococca and f. graminearum, both of which are in the genus fusarium, but with a lack of conservation of the gene organization in more distant species, including the loss of sesa. there are no data concerning the potential development of secteur in the f. graminearum strain used by the fungal genome initiative for sequencing.

s <dig> is dominant in diploids
to investigate the dominance of s <dig>  we co-transformed the wild-type strain with psec3-s <dig> and pbc-hygro. psec3-s <dig> was obtained by cloning into 'pgem-t easy' , a pcr amplification product constructed with oligonucleotides im <dig> and ip2393c  using the s <dig> mutant genomic dna as template. thus, psec3-s <dig> contained the entire ses locus present in the s <dig> mutant strain. among  <dig> tested hygr transformants, seven could not differentiate secteurs. stui-restricted dna from five of these transformants was analyzed by southern blotting. two integration patterns were observed . for three transformants, the expected wild-type stui fragment was absent, suggesting that integration altered the ses locus, thus accounting for the lack of secteur formation. for the two other transformants, the wild-type stui fragment was present, as was an additional band larger than  <dig> kb. as this band hybridized with psec3-s <dig> and the hph hygromycin resistance marker , these transformants could be interpreted as bearing a co-integration of pbc-hygro and psecs <dig> at an ectopic position. sequencing of the ses locus in these two transformants that do not display secteurs confirmed the presence of both alleles, i.e., the wild-type allele at the resident locus and the mutated allele s <dig> at an ectopic position. this clearly demonstrated the dominance of the s <dig> mutation, in contrast to the s* mutations, which are recessive.

discussion
although the secteur and anneau phenomena were described about  <dig> years ago  <cit> , the molecular mechanisms able to generate these fascinating bistable differentiations are still mysterious. early studies suggested peculiar epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> . in this study, we have initiated the molecular characterization of ses, the primary locus controlling the development of secteurs.

the impact of mutagenesis procedures
the experimental design, based on the differences in the growth rate between modified and normal cells, was very efficient in finding mutations that block the propagation of secteurs after the action of both uv and ng . a vast collection of mutants affected in the secteur expression was easily obtained. one mutant with an s phenotype was isolated, along with  <dig> s* mutants. apparently, ng  mutagenesis was more efficient than uv mutagenesis in recovering these specific mutants . genetic analysis showed that the structure of the ses locus mirrors the structure of the ans locus, indicating that α and σ could be generated through similar mechanisms, in agreement with the fact that both factors require the same set of nas genes for propagation.

relationships between s <dig> and wt alleles: recessivity in heterokaryons versus dominance in partial diploids
dominance/recessivity tests using balanced heterokaryons showed that s1/wt heterokaryons were able to differentiate secteurs as wild type. the recessivity of s <dig>  deduced from the heterokaryon tests was the initial point of our cloning strategy, i.e., the use of cosmid libraries from wild type to restore the ability to express the secteur in an s <dig> recipient strain. the screening of two representative cosmid libraries failed, and we examined various hypotheses to explain this failure, especially the possibility of the dominance of s <dig>  in order to easily clone the ses locus, we used an insertional mutagenesis strategy, a powerful method for gene isolation in filamentous fungi  <cit> . with the pan7- <dig> vector,  <dig> hygr transformants were screened for defects in mycelium pigmentation, colony morphology, and the expression of the secteur and around 4% of mutant phenotypes were detected. this frequency is similar to the  <dig>  to  <dig> % reported for loss of pathogenicity in different fungal species  <cit> . among them,  <dig> nas mutants and  <dig> s mutant were obtained. given the proportion observed for classical mutagenesis , the recovery of the s <dig> mutant was an unexpected outcome. although we may have been lucky, the recovery of this transformant may reflect a preference for plasmid integration in the region of the ses locus, which is compatible with the high recombination frequency observed at ses. cloning of ses permitted the construction by transformation of a partial diploid containing both the wild-type and s <dig> mutant alleles. the fact that this partial diploid has a s phenotype indicates that s <dig> allele is indeed dominant over the wild-type allele in partial diploids. similar contradictions have been observed in a. nidulans by comparing diploids and heterokaryons for complementation between mutations in the regulatory and the cognate structural genes. these data were interpreted as being due to a limitation of regulatory gene products to the nucleus or by a stringent dose effect when combined with a nonrandom distribution of nuclei in heterokaryons  <cit> . in our study, a dose effect is also probable. in n. haematococca, as reported earlier  <cit> , only 1–10% of hyphal fragments containing 3– <dig> cells are heterokaryotic, the others corresponding to both homokaryons in similar proportions. in addition, phase-contrast microscopic observation of the prototrophic mycelia revealed the presence of rows of uninucleate cells disrupting the heterokaryotic association. this structure does not prevent the stability of balanced heterokaryons with regard to metabolic requirements , but might severely affect the dosage of the sesa products expressed from the wild-type and s <dig> nuclei in different portions of the thallus. because s <dig> is dominant and corresponds to a missense mutation, it is likely that the product expressed from sesa in s <dig> is a dominant negative. if its concentration is insufficient, especially in hyphae homokaryotic for wild-type sesa nuclei, the propagation of σ and secteur formation is favored. in contrast, in diploids an even ratio of the two products is always achieved, preventing propagation of σ and secteur formation.

integrated model of functional elements at the ses locus
the molecular characterization of ses shows that it is composed of two linked and expressed genes, sesa and sesb, both of which are necessary for secteur expression. each has a different role. the s <dig> and s <dig> mutants map to sesa. because s <dig> is an integration of a large segment of dna at the beginning of sesa, the phenotype of the s <dig> mutant probably results from a complete loss of function of sesa. the s <dig> mutant carries a dominant missense mutation and therefore synthesizes the sesa mrna, and probably a dominant negative protein. the sesap protein has no evident homologue in the databanks yielding a clue to its function. as s <dig> does not produce the σ determinant, cannot be contaminated by mycelia carrying σ, and never differentiates the secteur morphology, sesa is probably necessary for the production and transmission of σ.

all s* mutations map to sesb and determine a red-pigmented phenotype associated with the generation of the σ determinant throughout the thallus, but without any growth alteration. it is noteworthy that all the s* mutations are probably not simply preventing the production of a functional mrna, but are also not preventing the production of an active protein, as they map outside the evolutionarily conserved region of the protein. the function of sesb and its homologue remains unknown in fungi; however the inactivation by rna interference of the most similar gene in c. elegans is lethal during embryogenesis, suggesting that the protein produced by sesb could be essential . based on the analysis of the mutant phenotype triggered by s* mutation, the wild-type sesb product is involved in the repression of pigmentation and σ generation.

to date, this situation has not been described for any of the previously reported systems responsible for bistable or multistable switches in fungi. previous systems implicated prions  <cit> , chromatin silencing  <cit> , hysteresis in a map kinase cascade  <cit> , and possible membrane inheritance  <cit> . at present, it is premature to propose a molecular model to explain the secteur, because sesa and sesb display weak similarity only with proteins of unknown function. however, from our data we can infer that sesa most likely encodes a regulatory factor for sesb and that the regulation probably takes place at the protein level and probably not at the rna level, since s <dig> and all s* mutation are point mutations that are not likely to affect rna transcription and stability. two formal models could explain how the regulation might work.

firstly, the product of sesa  could exist in two states: one, an, characterizing the normal morphology and the other, as, determining the secteur morphology . the transition an to as may be initiated by a rare event in cells of the growing margin of the thallus. once formed, the as state becomes predominant by directing other an molecules to adopt the same state. this positive feedback loop allows as propagation from hyphae to hyphae through anastomoses. as alone would induce the hyperproduction of pigments . in addition, the product of sesb  can adopt the normal bn state, which can be transformed into a bs state in the presence of as. bs would be responsible for the growth alterations observed in the secteur and would follow the propagation of as .

in the second model, sesap may negatively regulate sesbp but also be negatively regulated by sesbp . in the normal mycelium, sesbp, which probably has a catalytic activity, would be active in promoting healthy growth. the appearance in some cells from the growing margin of a sufficient amount of sesap would displace the equilibrium, resulting in the inhibition of sesbp. in order for this to happen, the equilibrium constants must be in favor of sesap. this would result in growth impairment  and in a red pigmentation . in the s mutants, sesap would never be present, thus making the presence of sesbp constitutive . in the s* mutant, the interactions between the two proteins would be abolished, permitting the activity of both sesap and sesbp . this model could explain the dynamic equilibrium found in the zis area, as well as the dose effect for sesap, explaining the difference of heterokaryons and partial diploids.

CONCLUSIONS
secteur, one of the two bistable and hysteretic differentiations exhibited by the filamentous fungus n. haematococca, is controlled by a complex, two-gene locus. each gene has a distinct role in defining bistability, and atypical regulatory relations between the two proteins coded by the two genes may account for the hysteresis of secteur differentiation. the data exemplify the diversity of mechanisms that generate differentiation in fungi, and, more generally, in eukaryotes.
