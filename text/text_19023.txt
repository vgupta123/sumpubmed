BACKGROUND
genetic instabilities are characteristic of most human cancers. genome-wide detection of chromosomal changes, including loss of heterozygosity  and copy number alterations , either gain or loss, are the focus of substantial attention in cancer research. loh is frequently observed in a variety of human cancers, and regions with frequent loh may contain tumor suppressor genes. in addition, loh may associate with the regions affected by haplo-insufficiency of a group of genes. thus, detection of loh will likely remain a cornerstone for predicting tumor aggressiveness for many human tumors  <cit> . recently, the discovery of large-scale genome-wide copy number variation has stimulated interest in elucidating the role of cna in the development of malignancy. the  <dig> k single nucleotide polymorphism  array  offers a high-resolution genomic approach to screen chromosomal alterations systematically. several studies on allelic imbalance or loss in cancers and cancer cell lines using the  <dig> k snp array have been published  <cit> .

esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  is a common malignancy worldwide and one of the most common malignancies in the chinese population. there is great geographic variation in the occurrence of this tumor in china, including exceptionally high-risk areas such as shanxi province in north central china where some of the highest esophageal cancer rates in the world occur. the standardized incidence rate for esophageal cancer in shanxi province is above 100/ <dig>  person-years, although it appears that both incidence and mortality rates have begun to decline in the past  <dig> years  <cit> . within the high-risk regions in china, there is a strong tendency toward familial aggregation, suggesting that genetic susceptibility, in conjunction with environmental exposures, plays a role in the etiology of escc. in the past several years, we have tried to identify susceptibility genes and biomarkers that can be used to screen high-risk populations in north central china for escc  <cit> . a previous study examined  <dig> microsatellite markers in a  <dig> cm density genome-wide scan in  <dig> escc patients, and identified  <dig> chromosome arms with high-frequency loh  <cit> . however, we were unable to further narrow these loh regions using microsatellite markers due to their low density. higher density markers are necessary for positional cloning of tumor suppressor genes in loh regions.

in the present study we established a high-resolution chromosomal instability profile for escc by examining germ-line dna and matched micro-dissected tumor dna with a  <dig> k snp array to determine both loh and cna. we also evaluated whether a pool of normal control samples could be used as the normal referent in an loh study with the  <dig> k snp chip instead of matched germ-line dna.

RESULTS
loh by patient and chromosomal arms
in the present study,  <dig> escc patients with blood-derived germ-line dna and matched micro-dissected tumor dna were investigated using  <dig> k snp arrays. the characteristics of these patients are shown in table  <dig>  the average signal detection rate was higher in germ-line dna  than that in micro-dissected tumor dna . based on ncbi build  <dig> , we summarized characteristics of  <dig>  snps and mapped them to chromosomes and genes. we first generated a genotyping profile for each patient based on a comparison of the germ-line dna genotypes to those from the matched micro-dissected tumor dna. the patients' loh frequencies, shown in table  <dig>  ranged from 19% to 95%, and averaged 29%. loh in four cases  was performed using dna from micro-dissected adjacent normal tissue in addition to blood-derived germ-line dna to see if this affected results, but findings were very similar with both of these two sources of dna .

the frequencies of loh on each chromosomal arm are shown in table  <dig>  non-random loh was observed on  <dig> chromosomal arms, including 17p , 9p , 9q , 13q , 17q , 4q , 4p , 3p , 15q , and 5q . our previous microsatellite marker-based genome-wide loh scan in  <dig> escc patients with a positive family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer produced overall loh frequencies that were somewhat higher than the patients evaluated in the present study  <cit> . we can not explain this between-study loh frequency variation, but there are several noteworthy differences between the studies that likely influenced loh rates, including:  heterozygosity is higher for the microsatellite compared to the snp markers examined ;  the total number of markers was much higher in the snp study than the microsatellite study ; and  over twice as many cases were examined in the snp study . some results between studies differed . despite differences in study size, approach, and in some of the results, consistently high loh frequencies were reported for nine chromosomal arms in both studies . both studies taken together indicate that loh on these nine chromosomal arms are the major events associated with genome-wide instability in escc in this high-risk chinese population. these areas are rich in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, including vhl on 3p; npca <dig> on 4p; kit, gist, and pdgfra on 4q; apc and mcc on 5q; cdkn2a and cdkn2b on 9p; brca <dig> and rb <dig> on 13q; tp <dig> on 17p; and brca <dig>  toc, and nf <dig> on 17q.

loh regions
when we used the conservative, traditional approach to loh in loh/model a, we detected  <dig> loh regions encompassing a total of  <dig> snps. as shown in table  <dig>  these  <dig> loh regions are located on eight chromosome arms – 13q , 3p , 4q , 9p , 9q , 17p , 17q , and 4p . the size of these loh regions ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  mb ; genes involved in these deletion regions are shown in table  <dig>  among the  <dig> snps in these  <dig> loh regions,  <dig> are located in genes , and  <dig> are located in regions flanking genes . one snp  is located in the coding region of gene zzef <dig>  on chromosome 17p <dig> . allele a for this snp encodes an amino acid proline  and the allele b encodes amino acid leucine . eight of  <dig> heterozygous cases  showed loh , including five cases that lost allele b and three cases that lost allele a. the  <dig> snps that are located within genes map to  <dig> genes and include four snps in the introns of znf <dig>  and two snps each in the introns of itpr <dig>  flj <dig>  lhfp, itgae, myh <dig> and myocd. some of these  <dig> deletion regions have been previously identified by our lab and others  <cit> . however, the current study provides far greater precision in locating loh regions . as expected, using a less conservative definition for loh, loh/model b detected more regions  than our approach in loh/model a –  <dig> loh regions containing  <dig>  snps. the distribution of deletion regions and details from this model are shown in table  <dig> and additional table  <dig> .

our cloh data in cloh/model a identified only three significant cloh regions. these included one on 13q12-q <dig> and two on 13q <dig>  and encompassed a total of  <dig> snps. the sizes of these cloh regions are  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb, and  <dig>  mb, respectively  . the less conservative cloh/model b highlighted  <dig> cloh regions with  <dig>  snps; details are shown in table  <dig> and additional table  <dig> .

examples of the whole genome profiles for regions on chromosome arms 9p/q, 13q, and 17p are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

comparison of loh and cloh regions
our conservative loh/model a detected  <dig> loh regions including  <dig> snps, but our conservative cloh/model a detected only three loh regions containing  <dig> snps. the detection of only three loh regions by cloh/model a is not unexpected since identifying an loh region in a sample requires the presence of multiple homozygous snps in a large genomic area and the chance for multiple homozygous snps in more than 75% of the samples is low. the three cloh regions are all on chromosome 13q12-q <dig>  eleven snps were detected by both conservative loh and cloh models  . five snps detected by the conservative cloh/model a are located in two genes, flj <dig> and b3gtl. due to the relatively small number of loh regions defined by cloh/model a, as well as the different definitions of loh used in these two approaches, it was not possible to compare the concordance between these two methods.

our less conservative loh/model b and cloh/model b were identical except that loh/model b used the matched normal controls while cloh/model b used pooled normal control samples. snps in the loh regions from loh/model b totaled  <dig> ;  <dig>  snps were identified in the cloh regions from cloh/model b. the number of snps common to both loh and cloh models  was  <dig> , while a total of  <dig>  snps appeared only in loh/model b,  <dig> snps were found only in cloh/model b, and  <dig>  showed retention in both models. using loh/model b as a standard, sensitivity/specificity for cloh/model b were 64% and 97%, respectively. the overall pearson correlation coefficient between these two models was  <dig>  . taken together, we detected more snp loci in loh/model b than cloh/model b, but concordance between the two methods was generally good, suggesting that the use of pooled normal control samples may be acceptable for loh studies.

cna regions
comparisons between loh and cna
we obtain both cloh and cna data when we use the pooled normal control sample reference in the cnat software. thus we can ask the question of whether the cloh is associated with cna. our studies showed that among  <dig>  snps identified in our less conservative cloh/model b, only  <dig>  showed cna loss and just  <dig>  showed cna gain . this result suggests that cna accounts for small percent of loh events in escc. loh in cancers is commonly caused by one of three different mechanisms. the first and most common cause of loh is mitotic recombination  <cit> . this mechanism doesn't change chromosome copy number, and was responsible for 97% of the loh observed in our study. deletion, the second cause of loh, should result in copy number loss, and occurred in approximately two percent of loh in our study. finally, loh can result from amplification of one chromosome, which should show copy number gain. this mechanism accounted for less than one percent of loh in our study. although chromosomal amplification occurs often, only occasionally do amplification events result in loh, which correspond to unbalanced amplification of one chromosome. however, some studies have demonstrated concordance between loh and cna. for example, wong et al found loh associated with cna gain at 6q12- <dig> in osteosarcoma  <cit> , and zhao et al found a link between loh and cna gain at 1q22-q <dig>  and 1q <dig> - <dig> in oral squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . these differences might reflect genuine differences between tumor types, the lab analytic methods used, or different operative mechanisms at work.

the genome-wide loh and chromosome copy alteration studies described in this paper can also be applied to higher density snp chips, such as affymetrix  <dig> k and  <dig> k snp chips. the increased snp density will allow even finer mapping of these genetic changes.

in summary, we performed a genome-wide study of loh and cna in escc patients using the affymetrix  <dig> k snp chip by comparing matched germ-line and tumor dna. our approach allowed us to extensively map both loh and cnas in escc systematically in a manner that has not heretofore been done, and produced numerous regions, genes, and snps that merit future exploration. this report is the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of chromosomal imbalance  in escc, and the knowledge gained from this analysis will enable the development of improved strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat escc patients in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
the affymetrix  <dig> k snp chip is a valid platform to integrate analyses of loss of heterozygosity and copy number alterations. the comprehensive knowledge gained from this analysis will enable improved strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
