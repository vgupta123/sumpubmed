BACKGROUND
troponin t  is a class of skeletal muscle specific proteins that are an important component of the thin-filament. tnt proteins are essential for correct assembly of the sarcomeres  <cit>  and are responsible for anchoring of the troponin complex to tropomyosin  and correct assembly and function of troponin i and c  <cit> . in tetrapods, three tnt genes exist, fast, slow and cardiac, expressed respectively in white , red  and cardiac muscle. however, recent studies indicate that in teleosts a greater number of genes exist and at least two fast tnt  and two slow tnt  genes exist as well as an apparently teleost specific intronless tnt  gene  <cit> .

in terrestrial vertebrates, tnt genes are known to produce multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing mechanisms  <cit> . a number of factors, such as contractile properties  <cit> , intracellular ph  <cit>  in myofibres, calcium dependence modulation during cross-bridge cycling  <cit>  and innervation patterns during development  <cit> , are proposed to be associated with tnt isoform switching in cardiac and fast muscle of foetal and adult terrestrial vertebrates. in contrast, in terrestrial vertebrates, no developmental specific stnt protein isoform changes occur  <cit> , although in adults red-muscle-specific isoforms are detected  <cit> .

we recently reported the existence of three stage specific ftnt transcripts in a teleost, the sea bream, namely embryonic, larval and adult which are splice variants of a single gene  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to tetrapods, two paralogue stnt genes  that exhibit developmental specific expression were also identified in sea bream  <cit> . the teleost specific gene, stnt <dig>  is first detected in sea bream in late epiboly stages and is the only stnt gene expressed up until  <dig> days post-hatch  the time at which stnt <dig> expression starts  <cit> . throughout larval development and in early juvenile stages, stnt <dig> is the predominant stnt gene expressed in sea bream red muscle, although in adult red muscle stnt <dig> is the predominant isoform and stnt <dig> is virtually undetectable  <cit> .

studies in flatfish indicate that changes occur in muscle during the thyroid hormone driven metamorphosis in which a bilaterally symmetrical larvae changes to an asymmetric juvenile. in pre-metamorphic pelagic larvae of the flatfish paralichthys olivaceus  two ftnt immunoreactive proteins of  <dig>  and  <dig> kda were reported  <cit> . however, when the larvae enter metamorphosis to become a benthic flatfish, the  <dig>  kda protein is substituted by a new  <dig>  kda isoform. in post-metamorphosis juvenile fish only the  <dig> and  <dig>  kda isoforms of tnt are present  <cit> . similarly, during spontaneous metamorphosis larval  <dig> '-dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid  light chain  is replaced by an adult specific isoform  <cit> . although it is evident that changes which occur in muscle during metamorphosis are probably associated with changing functional requirements, surprisingly few molecular studies exist of this process. in the present study in order to analyse changes in skeletal muscle and in particular tnt gene expression during halibut  natural and t <dig> induced metamorphosis, cdnas for slow and fast tnt were cloned and their expression and tissue distribution was studied in relation to changing thyroid hormone concentrations and muscle development.

RESULTS
halibut tnt genes
five cdnas corresponding to different skeletal muscle tnt genes  were isolated from a cdna library of metamorphosing halibut larvae. in tblastx analysis  <cit>  against the genebank database, three cdnas gave a highly significant match with teleost, ftnt genes. from the analysis it was determined that the ftnthh cdnas isolated correspond to a putative embryonic/larval halibut ftnt  and two different adult isoforms . the eftnthh cdna is a full-length clone with  <dig> nucleotides  and encodes a  <dig> amino acids  protein from nt  <dig> to  <dig>  the size of the deduced protein is  <dig>  kda and the predicted pi is  <dig>   <cit> . the ftnthh- <dig> isoform is a  <dig> bp cdna which encodes a protein of  <dig> aa from nt  <dig> to  <dig> . the deduced ftnthh- <dig> protein has a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig>   <cit> . the cdna of the third isoform, denominated ftnthh- <dig>  is  <dig>  bp long and encodes a putative protein of  <dig> aa from nt  <dig> to  <dig> . the predicted molecular weight and pi for the ftnthh- <dig> protein isoform is respectively  <dig>  kda and  <dig>   <cit> .

in silico characterisation of the deduced halibut ftnt proteins using prodom  <cit>  and prints  <cit>  software confirmed that they possess all the characteristics of fully functional ftnt proteins. clustalx  <cit>  multiple alignment analysis of these putative halibut ftnt cdnas and their deduced protein sequence indicates that they are the products of alternative splicing of the halibut ftnt gene . isoform eftnthh shares 80% sequence identity with ftnthh- <dig> and - <dig> isoforms, whereas isoforms ftnthh- <dig> and - <dig> are 99% similar. the differences between the halibut tnt cdna isolated are due to the presence of an insert in eftnthh  and ftnthh- <dig>  which is lacking in the fththh- <dig> isoform .

a further  <dig>  bp cdna was also cloned and tblastx analysis  <cit>  suggests that it most closely resembles an ftnt gene and gave the most significant hit to d. rerio ftnta gene and it was tentatively designated an atypical fast tnt cdna  as a consequence of its tissue distribution. the predicted protein product encoded by aftnthh- <dig> cdna was  <dig> aa with a pi of  <dig>  and molecular weight of  <dig>  kda  <cit> .

a halibut cdna homologous to a previously reported teleost specific stnt <dig> gene was also cloned. this cdna, designated stnt2hh , is  <dig> bp long and encodes a deduced protein of  <dig> aa  with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig> kda and a pi of  <dig>   <cit> . it was not possible, despite extensive cdna library screening to isolate a cdna that was the product of a putative halibut stnt <dig> gene.

clustalx multiple sequence alignment  <cit>  of the deduced amino acid sequence of halibut tnt genes show that eftnthh shares 69% and 52% sequence identity, respectively, with aftnthh and stnt2hh. comparison of the other halibut ftnt- <dig> and - <dig> isoforms with aftnthh and stnt2hh reveal they share ~59% sequence identity while, aftnthh and stnt2hh share 50% identity.

putative genomic organization of halibut skeletal tnt genes
in silico tblastx analysis  <cit>  using halibut ftnt cdna sequences gave a highly significant hit to tetraodon nigroviridis genomic scaffold  <dig> . the putative tetraodon and deduced halibut ftnt gene is composed of  <dig> exons  as previously described for the sea bream  <cit> . the eftnthh isoform is composed of exons i to iii and v to xiv . isoform ftnthh- <dig> contains all exons except exon v, which codes for the highly acidic peptide containing a glutamic acid , proline  repeat . in the isoform ftnthh- <dig> mrna, exons iv and v are spliced out  which results in the loss of  <dig> nt in relation to ftnthh- <dig> . the atg transcription start signal is located in exon ii and exon i bears the beginning of the 5'utr . the 3'utr and the end of the protein coding region are located in exon xiv. overall coverage of the ftnthh cdna sequences was 97% and overall identity between it and the tetraodon ftnt gene sequence was 82%.

the halibut aftnthh gene used in tblastx analysis led to the identification of the putative tetraodon aftnt locus in scaffold  <dig>  as well as five different tetraodon aftnt cdna isoforms  which seem to be the product of alternative splicing . the tetraodon aftnt cdna and the aftnthh cdna were used to deduce the putative genomic organization of the aftnt gene in tetraodon scaffold  <dig> by aligning the cdnas and genomic sequences in spidey  <cit> . the analysis revealed that the tetraodon aftnt gene  is composed of  <dig> exons with conserved intron/exon boundaries spanning  <dig> bp in tetraodon scaffold  <dig> . tetraodon aftnttn cdnas had 100% coverage in the tetraodon genomic sequence of scaffold  <dig> and the majority of exons shared 100% nucleotide sequence conservation. the halibut aftnthh cdna had 100% coverage in the tetraodon genomic sequence of scaffold  <dig> and shared 79% overall sequence identity. exon i bears part of the 5'utr while exon ii contains the remainder and the atg translation start site. exon iii is composed of  <dig> nt and constitutes together with exons i and ii the n-terminal constitutive exons present in all tetraodon aftnt cdnas identified. exon ii and iii share 77% sequence identity between the tetraodon genomic sequence and halibut aftnthh cdna, while exon i shares only 58% identity. exon iv which codes for  <dig> acidic residues both in tetraodon and halibut is the first n-terminal alternatively spliced exon in tetraodon cdnas, and shares 75% sequence identity between tetraodon genomic and halibut aftnthh cdna sequence. exon v is the largest alternatively spliced n-terminal exon in tetraodon and is the most divergent between the tetraodon genomic sequence and halibut aftnt cdna. in this exon the sequence identity is only 52% and a  <dig> nt insertion in the third quarter of the tetraodon genomic sequence renders this exon bigger in tetraodon than in halibut. however, the 5' and 3' regions of the tetraodon sequence are well conserved with the corresponding halibut aftnt sequence. exons vi and vii are highly conserved  between the tetraodon genomic sequence and halibut aftnt cdna sequence and are alternatively spliced in tetraodon. exons viii to xvi encode the c-terminal constitutive region present in all vertebrate tnt genes and sequence conservation between the tetraodon and halibut was always greater than 85% and no splice variants of this region were observed in tetraodon. exon xvi codes for the last  <dig> amino acid residues of the protein and the entire 3'utr. although exon xvi shares only 47% sequence identity between tetraodon and halibut the sequence divergence is in the 3'utr rather than the coding region .

the genomic organization of halibut stnt <dig> gene in tetraodon was also determined . using the stnt2hh sequence in tblastx analysis  <cit>  of the tetraodon genome database  <cit>  a single hit with tetraodon scaffold  <dig>  was found. a single cdna transcript  arising from tetraodon stnt <dig> gene  was isolated and introduced in spidey aligning software  <cit>  along with the halibut stnt <dig> cdna sequence to determine the putative genomic organization of stnt <dig>  the putative tetraodon stnt locus is composed of  <dig> exons and spans  <dig> nt in the tetraodon genomic sequence . exon i bears the first three-quarters of the 5'utr and the beginning of the coding region is located in exon ii. exon xii contains the 3'-end of the coding region as well as the 3'utr . the halibut stnt2hh cdna sequence had 86% coverage in the tetraodon genomic sequence and shared 82% sequence identity.

tissue specificity of halibut tnt genes
northern blot and rt-pcr analysis were carried out in order to determine tissue specificity of the halibut tnt genes isolated. the northern blot results  show that ftnthh, as expected, is expressed in adult halibut white  muscle and is absent from red muscle, cardiac muscle and liver. however, the more sensitive rt-pcr technique revealed that ftnthh is also expressed in halibut adult red muscle . the tblastx and phylogenetic analysis of aftnthh classified this cdna as the product of a fast tnt gene, although its expression is red  muscle specific  and it is not detected in adult white  muscle, cardiac muscle or liver. the halibut stnt <dig> gene is exclusively expressed in halibut adult red muscle . the red muscle tissue specificity of aftnthh and stnt2hh was further confirmed by rt-pcr .

phylogenetic analysis of halibut tnt genes
clustalx multiple sequence alignment  <cit>  of the deduced protein of halibut tnt and other vertebrate tnt protein sequences and striated muscle tnt from c. elegans was performed and the resulting phylogenetic relationships were determined in paup* version  <dig> b software  <cit>  using the maximum-parsimony method with  <dig> bootstraps  <cit>  and c. elegans tnt as an outgroup.

the phylogenetic tree shows that the vertebrate ftnts form a single clade and that within it the tetrapod ftnts cluster apart from the fish ftnts . moreover, eftnthh, ftnthh- <dig> and ftnthh- <dig> cluster with highly significant bootstrap values with other teleost ftnt genes. within the main ftnt clade, aftnthh and tetraodon aftnttn isoforms clustered together and formed a separate group and this topology was supported by highly significant bootstrap values .

two principal clades were found for stnt which corresponded to stnt <dig> and stnt <dig> . the halibut stnt2hh clusters with other teleost specific stnt <dig> genes  and forms a group apart from tetrapod stnt and stnt <dig>  which clustered together.

tnt expression during halibut metamorphosis
the expression of the isolated halibut ftnt, aftnt and stnt <dig> genes was analysed by rt-pcr during halibut metamorphosis . the primers used in this analysis encompass the entire n-terminal hypervariable region which is known in vertebrates to generate alternative spliced isoforms  <cit> . three ftnthh isoforms were amplified by rt-pcr during halibut metamorphosis, the largest product corresponded to eftnthh  while the smaller products correspond to, ftnthh- <dig>  and ftnthh- <dig> . a further reaction product is observed between the eftnthh and the other two isoforms that does not represent an authentic isoform but a heteroduplex of eftnthh and the other two isoforms since isolation followed by pcr, subcloning and sequencing always yield either eftnthh or one of the other two isoforms.

the three halibut ftnt isoforms are all present in pre-metamorphic halibut larvae  and eftnthh is the predominant isoform expressed up until the beginning of climax and has approximately 2-fold higher expression than ftnthh- <dig> and - <dig> . at the beginning of climax ftnthh- <dig> expression starts to increase and at the climax of metamorphosis  the eftnthh isoform is downregulated and is almost undetectable in fully metamorphosed juveniles . in parallel ftnthh- <dig> becomes the most highly expressed ftnthh isoform and increases ~3-fold in juveniles . prior to, and after metamorphosis ftnthh- <dig> expression does not change significantly . analysis of ftnt isoform expression in adult halibut muscle by rt-pcr confirmed the general pattern encountered by northern blot . however, the more sensitive rt-pcr technique permitted detection of ftnthh isoforms in halibut adult red -muscle . in halibut adult white muscle low expression of eftnthh  is observed, ftnthh- <dig> continues to be the predominant isoform although ftnthh- <dig> expression has increased and is about half that of ftnthh- <dig> . the ratio of the different ftnthh mrna in red muscle differs from white muscle since ftnthh- <dig> is ~10-fold more expressed than eftnthh and ftnthh- <dig> which are almost undetectable .

in contrast to ftnthh, expression of halibut aftnthh  and stnt2hh  detected by rt-pcr does not change during metamorphosis . however,  <dig> alternatively spliced isoforms of aftnthh are detected . sequence analysis reveals that the aftnthh isoforms are a result of alternative splicing of exons iv, v and vii  and are designated aftnthh- <dig> to - <dig>  the largest product, aftnthh- <dig>  is identical to the aftnthh cdna isolated by library screening and includes all alternatively spliced exons ; aftnthh- <dig>  lacks exons iv and vii but exon v is maintained ; aftnthh- <dig>  is composed of exon iv and vii but exon v is spliced out ; and in aftnthh- <dig>  only exon iv is spliced in and all other alternatively spliced exons  are spliced out . all the halibut aftnthh isoforms detected contain exon vi  and neither the isoform expression pattern nor the ratio between these aftnthh isoforms is altered during metamorphosis . a small but statistically significant  decrease in expression of all the isoforms is observed in stg  <dig> juveniles; aftnthh- <dig> is the predominant isoform throughout the halibut's life. in turn, aftnthh- <dig> is the second most abundant isoform and its expression increases after climax . however, in adult red muscle the ratio of the two isoforms is identical to pre-metamorphic stg  <dig> animals . the aftnthh- <dig> and - <dig> isoforms have identical , very low expression  and their expression and ratio in relation to other isoforms does not change during metamorphosis . moreover, in adult red muscle these low molecular weight isoforms are not expressed .

spatial-temporal expression pattern of halibut tnt genes during metamorphosis
the spatial-temporal expression pattern of tnt mrna was determined in free- swimming halibut larvae which feed exogenously. in such larvae two distinct muscle layers are evident, an inner white and superficial red muscle layer . in stage  <dig> halibut the anatomical organisation of the white muscle is very simple with a "v" shaped myomere and it is composed of several block-like bilaterally symmetrical myotomes bounded by a septum. the extreme dorsal and ventral myotomes and the lateral region of the myotomes close to the red muscle is characterized by the presence of numerous small rounded fibres, characteristic of germinal zones, while in the deeper region of the larger myotomes, fibres are much larger, more block-like and are closely packed. in subsequent stages myotome number increases and in stage  <dig> halibut larvae they take on the typical "w" shaped myomer organisation.

no change in the bilateral symmetry of the muscle anatomy accompanies metamorphosis, although a significant increase in the volume of muscle occurs in stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . regions of hyperplastic growth persist in the most ventral and dorsal myotomes in all of the stages analysed. a rapid increase in myotome number is evident from stage  <dig> through  <dig> and in subsequent stages hypertrophic growth leads to a considerable increase in myotome and overall muscle volume. in stage  <dig> the red muscle layer is a monolayer of fibres at the outermost region of the myotomes, although proliferating red muscle fibres at the midline region of the myotome generate a small region with a double layer of fibres. in stage  <dig> larvae this double layer is much more evident and in successive larval stages all the red muscle layer is proliferating so that in stage  <dig> halibut it is composed of several layers of fibres of different sizes. notably during the entire metamorphic process the symmetry of the myotomes is maintained even though the skull becomes asymmetric with the right eye migrating to the left side of the head that at the end of metamorphosis constitutes the dorsal side of halibut body.

halibut embryonic/larval ftnt exon expression in pre-metamorphic halibut larvae  is restricted to white muscle, in the lateral and apical germinal zones of the myotome. as the halibut larvae approach metamorphic climax  the eftnthh expression is significantly downregulated and confined to very small fibres and to presumptive satellite cells . from climax of metamorphosis  onwards no eftnthh expression is detected. the 3'utr ftnt probe reveals the general ftnthh expression pattern in stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig> larvae  which is similar to that observed with the embryonic/larval ftnt exon probe. at stage  <dig>  ftnt is uniformly distributed in the white muscle. as the animals reach post-metamorphic juvenile stage  <dig>  ftnthh expression looses its uniformity and although still expressed in the entire myotome, the signal is more intense in cells close to the myosepta .

halibut aftnt and stnt <dig> gene expression is confined to red muscle fibres in all metamorphic stages analysed. expression of aftnt in pre-metamorphic stage  <dig> larvae  is highly abundant in the red muscle layer. at the end of larval life, just before the onset of metamorphosis,  in the myotome midline region two red muscle cell layers both expressing aftnt are present . in stage  <dig>  the expression of aftnthh is detected uniformly in all the fibres of the red muscle, while in post-metamorphic juveniles at stage  <dig>  it is mostly present in the smaller fibres . in the case of stnt <dig>  expression is restricted to the red muscle layer and is very similar to aftnt in stage  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  halibut. the spatial-temporal expression pattern of red muscle specific halibut tnt genes is symmetrical and does not change during halibut metamorphosis .

th levels in metamorphosing halibut
at the beginning of metamorphosis and up until the beginning of climax , t <dig> levels remain low with no significant differences observed between stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in fact in larvae at the beginning of metamorphosis  t <dig> levels are lower than in pre-metamorphic larvae . at the climax of metamorphosis , whole-body t <dig> content increases about 3-fold in relation to all the previous stages . in post-metamorphic juveniles  t <dig> levels continue high and, although not significantly different from stage  <dig>  they are significantly higher than all other preceding stages .

before metamorphosis and up until climax of metamorphosis  t <dig> levels are lower than t <dig> . in fact, t <dig> levels decrease from pre-metamorphic larvae  until the start of metamorphosis  . however, in halibut at climax  t <dig> levels increase more than 200-fold and are higher than t <dig> levels . however, after metamorphosis t <dig> levels are again higher than t <dig> levels . t <dig> levels at climax and in fully metamorphosed juveniles are significantly higher than all previous halibut stages .

t <dig> treatment and halibut tnt expression
treatment of pre-metamorphic halibut larvae for  <dig> days with t <dig> totally repressed eftnthh isoform expression  without affecting the expression of the other two ftnthh isoforms . neither aftnthh or stnt2hh expression or isoform profile is altered from that of control larvae by t <dig> treatment .

discussion
we have isolated cdnas from three different striated muscle tnt genes in the halibut one of which is white muscle specific while the other two are red muscle specific. alternative splicing of the ftnthh gene gives rise to three alternative splice variants which encode three proteins varying only in the n-terminal region . as observed for the ftnt gene of s. auratus  <cit> , halibut ftnt is also expressed in adult red muscle. in fact, the expression of teleost fast-specific genes in red muscle seems to be a common feature in teleost species  <cit> . in relation to ftnthh- <dig>  and ftnthh- <dig> , the putative eftnthh protein isoform is bigger  and more acidic  and the difference arises as a consequence of splicing in of exon v , in a way similar to that previously reported in s. auratus, a perciform and also in other vertebrates  <cit> ,  <cit> . in the halibut the number of alternatively spliced ftnt isoforms are the same as found in tetraodon and s. auratus  <cit> . in common with tetraodon eftnt, exon v is spliced in and exon iv is spliced out . this is in contrast to eftnt in s. auratus in which exon iv is also spliced in along with exon v  <cit>  suggesting that in the halibut and tetraodon exons iv and v are mutually exclusively expressed . although no data is available about the specific biochemical characteristics of muscle fibres in halibut, s. aurata or tetraodon larvae, the present study indicates that differences probably exist between teleost species and these differences are probably an adaptation to their differing ecologies and locomotive strategies.

in rat, human and mouse it has been reported that some ftnt isoforms predominate over others due to the specific biochemical characteristics of different fibres types  <cit> . in these mammals acidic, fetal ftnt isoforms predominate in mainly glycolytic fibres whereas more basic isoforms are predominant in mainly oxidative fibres  <cit> . however, there are clear differences between teleost and tetrapod ftnt genes. in tetrapods alternative splicing of the ftnt gene generates several n-terminal protein isoforms through the use of a greater number of alternatively spliced exons  <cit>  whereas in teleosts it seems that only two exons undergo alternative splicing . although the fetal/embryonic exon is bigger in teleosts than in tetrapods they have similar biochemical characteristics as it encodes an acidic peptide containing several glutamic acid residues . no ftnt cdna isoforms which give rise to 3' spliced variants and therefore proteins with differing c-terminal sequences are observed in halibut, tetraodon or s. auratus. curiously, the deduced c-terminal amino acid sequence of all halibut ftnt isoforms share greatest identity to tetrapod isoforms containing the embryonic specific exon  <dig>  <cit> . together with a previous study in teleosts  <cit>  the present data in halibut seem to reinforce the idea that the occurrence of alternatively spliced exons in the c-terminal region of the ftnt gene is a characteristic exclusive to terrestrial vertebrates. nonetheless, the genomic organization of ftnt genes in teleosts is identical to tetrapods  <cit>  and from an evolutionary perspective, it seems likely that alternative splicing to generate n-terminal protein variants of the ftnt gene in vertebrates already occurred before the divergence of actinoperigii and sarcopterigii vertebrate lineages.

an unexpected observation arising from the present study was the identification of a large , highly acidic  halibut skeletal muscle tnt  gene with high sequence identity to d. rerio ftnta gene  <cit> . a homologue of this tnt gene was found in tetraodon together with five splice variants and despite its unusual characteristics it had a similar organization to other vertebrate tnt genes  <cit> . the highly acidic nature of the protein isoforms encoded by this gene is a consequence of splicing in of exon v which encodes a very acidic stretch  of amino acids. regardless of the fact that both sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis categorise the putative aftnthh protein as a fast tnt the tissue expression analysis  indicates that the aftnt is a red muscle specific gene in halibut. this is the first time to our knowledge that a gene presumed to be fast muscle specific in vertebrates is exclusively expressed in red muscle. the observations of tnts in halibut and zebrafish  <cit>  indicate that despite the apparent anatomical simplicity of striated skeletal muscle in teleosts, at the molecular level they have novel adaptations that probably underline species-specific control mechanisms of muscle development.

halibut tnt genes expression during metamorphosis
the expression of aftnthh and stnt2hh transcripts does not appear to change at climax of metamorphosis, although changes in the expression of ftnt gene isoforms do coincide with this developmental stage in halibut. the transition in expression of ftnt isoforms is correlated with the increase in whole-body t <dig> and t <dig> levels and the downregulation of eftnthh  in turn, th levels correlate positively with the increase in expression of ftnthh- <dig> . a similar situation also occurs in other flatfish, paralichthys olivaceus  <cit> , solea solea and scophthalmus maximus  <cit>  and at the climax of metamorphosis an acidic eftnt isoform is downregulated and lower molecular weight and more basic isoforms are upregulated, and detected in juvenile and adult white muscle.

the changes in ftnt isoform expression in different teleost  are reminiscent of what occurs in tetrapods in which fetal acidic ftnt isoforms are downregulated immediately after birth and are substituted by basic adult isoforms  <cit> . moreover, a common mechanism of alternative splicing of 5' exons in the ftnt gene in teleosts, birds and mammals, implied by similar codon splitage combinations  <cit> , further reinforces the hypothesis that alternative splicing of the ftnt gene is conserved and occurs in order to cope with similar developmental demands on muscle in all vertebrates. the transition from acidic to a basic isoforms in ftnt genes seems to be a common trend in vertebrates and represents a physiological, mechanistic and functional adaptation of developing striated muscle  <cit> . this strong conservation suggests that the same factors responsible for ftnt isoform transition during development are common throughout vertebrates and may be a trait acquired long before the divergence of the actinoperigii and sarcopterigii vertebrate lineages. in fact, teleost muscle and tetrapod muscle face similar physiological and biochemical changes during development. foetal mammalian muscle grows by hyperplasia up until birth and muscle fibres are mainly glycolytic while the mainly oxidative adult muscle fibres, that differentiate after birth, express predominantly basic ftnt isoforms  <cit> . in teleosts, the muscle fibres also change their biochemical and physiological characteristics during development and up until metamorphosis white muscle is the major respiratory surface of the larvae and fibres are mainly aerobic and rich in mitochondria whereas the adult muscle fibres are mainly anaerobic  <cit> .

as shown by others, and in contrast to tetrapod post-embryonic muscle development, in teleost species of large size, like the halibut, post-embryonic muscle development takes place in two steps in which hyperplasia is the main mechanism of muscle growth  <cit> . the first hyperplasic phase of post-embryonic muscle development in large size teleost larvae is characterised by proliferative epaxial and lateral areas of the myotome and as animals reach the juvenile stage these regions are depleted and a second stage of hyperplasic growth continues in scattered myogenic cells throughout the myotome. notably, the eftnthh isoform is mainly found at the most epaxial and lateral zones of halibut pre-metamorphic larval white muscle myotome, especially in small diameter white muscle fibres . the early differentiated halibut larvae white-muscle myoblasts appear to first express predominantly eftnt and as they mature and are incorporated in the myotome expression is downregulated and other ftnt isoforms take their place. in vertebrates the embryonic to adult ftnt isoforms pattern of change is related to alterations in cellular ph, metabolic and physiological characteristics of maturing muscle fibres  <cit> . the transition from acid to basic pi ftnt isoforms in developing halibut muscle may be associated with the transition from proliferative small diameter muscle cells to more basic larger white muscle fibres. in fact, in s. auratus it was found that larval small diameter myoblast cells located in the hyperplasic lateral and epaxial region of the larval myotome contain acid matpase activity whereas mature large diameter muscle fibres have mild alkali matpase activity  <cit> . together with the downregulation of expression of eftnthh at halibut metamorphosis these hyperplasic proliferative areas of the myotome are gradually depleted just as metamorphosis starts and totally absent in animals entering climax . this resembles the situation in s. auratus where at the end of larval life the same lateral and apical hyperplasic white muscle germinative areas are depleted  <cit> . however, and in contrast to what occurs in s. auratus  <cit> , the treatment of pre-metamorphic halibut larvae with t <dig> shows that thyroid hormones control the expression profile of ftnt isoforms in the halibut and also in other flatfish  <cit> .

the relationship between ths and change in ftnt isoform expression has yet to be directly demonstrated in teleosts. it is notable that despite the accepted role of ths in driving flatfish metamorphosis and the change from a symmetrical larvae to an asymmetrical juvenile, the way in which muscle symmetry changes has been largely ignored. in the present study muscle development was found to be a bilaterally symmetrical process before, during and after metamorphosis as revealed by histology and in situ gene expression studies. nonetheless, the changes in tnt isoform expression in halibut, s. solea, s. maximus and p. olivaceus indicate muscle is th responsive  <cit>  as has been demonstrated in mammals. in rats t <dig> increased the expression of ca2+ atpase specifically in white muscle fibres and the increase in relaxation rate of post-embryonic white muscle was strictly dependent on ths  <cit> . moreover, in mammals ths are necessary to complete development of skeletal muscle  <cit> . the results from experiments in teleosts suggest that various post-embryonic muscle development mechanisms exist. for example, in s. auratus  <cit>  slow muscle seems to be more sensitive to ths than white muscle, whereas in halibut, expression of the slow-muscle specific genes stnt2hh and aftnthh does not alter during metamorphosis  or in response to exongenous t <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
together with previous studies in teleost tnt genes  <cit>  the present work shows that teleost muscle, although apparently simpler and having a smaller number of specialized muscles in comparison to tetrapods  <cit>  shows remarkable genetic heterogeneity and species-specific regulation. the diversity of tnt forms in teleost muscle arise from alternative splicing but also from a new teleost specific tnt gene and this heterogeneity probably contributes to better adapt the musculature to the specific functional demands of different teleost species. in common with other flatfish, but in contrast to the round fish, s. auratus  <cit> , the halibut ftnt gene isoform expression profile is regulated at metamorphosis by ths, although halibut red muscle specific genes seem to be insensitive. interestingly, the asymmetry arising during flatfish metamorphosis does not extend to the musculature and the temporal and spatial expression patterns of tnt genes and muscle fibre organization remains symmetrical before, during and after metamorphosis . clearly ths regulate muscle development but far more work is required to establish the specific molecular and cellular events during flatfish and round fish muscle development.
