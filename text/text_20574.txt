BACKGROUND
mammalian genomes encode 60– <dig> rho gdp/gtp exchange factors  and a similar number of rho gtpase activating proteins  to control the activation and inactivation of ~ <dig> rho-family gtpases  <cit> . the fact that mutations in individual rho-gefs are associated with specific disease phenotypes indicates that their functions are not redundant. for example, the kalrn gene, which encodes proteins with two rho-gef domains, has been associated with stroke  <cit> , early onset coronary artery disease  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit>  and adult attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder  <cit> .

the mouse kalrn gene includes multiple promoters and several 3′-untranslated regions which produce functionally distinct isoforms in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner  <cit> . while some rho-gefs consist of little more than the catalytic dbl-homology  domain followed by a pleckstrin homology  domain, kalirin is a complex protein with multiple catalytic, protein/protein and protein/lipid interaction domains. the longest isoform, kalirin <dig>  contains a lipid-binding sec <dig> domain, nine spectrin-like repeats, two active rho-gef domains, two sh <dig> domains, an ig/fniii domain, and a kinase domain  <cit>  . the most abundant isoform in the adult brain, kalirin <dig>  is almost exclusively localized to the postsynaptic density   <cit> , and plays an essential role in dendritic spine formation and function  <cit> . kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> are more highly expressed during nervous system development  <cit>  and are also expressed in heart, skeletal muscle and endocrine tissue  <cit> . the single kalrn orthologue in c.elegans  and drosophila  plays essential roles both within and outside of the nervous system  <cit> .

multiple promoters and 3′-terminal exons in the kalrn gene preclude elimination of all isoforms through deletion of any one region of the gene. a knockout mouse for the most prevalent form of kalirin in the adult brain, kalirin <dig>  was generated by eliminating its unique 3′-exon   <cit> . kal7ko/ko mice have fewer dendritic spines in selected brain regions and exhibit impaired passive avoidance behavior, decreased anxiety-like behavior and accentuated locomotor sensitization to repeated cocaine treatment  <cit> . cahill et al.  <cit>  replaced kalrn exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode part of the first gef domain, with the neomycin resistance gene, generating the kalgef1ko/ko mouse  <cit> .

in this study, we flanked exon  <dig> in the spectrin repeat region with lox-p sites ; excision of this region makes it impossible to regain an in-reading-frame protein until exon  <dig>  global excision yielded kalsrko/ko mice while breeding of kalsrcko/cko mice to mice expressing cre-recombinase under control of the nestin promoter largely limited excision to the nervous system . based on our identification of kalirin through its interaction with a secretory granule enzyme, the association of kalrn with cardiovascular and psychiatric disease and the roles of unc- <dig> in c.elegans, we searched for deficits caused by lack of kalrn within and outside of the nervous system.

methods
creation of global and nervous system specific kalrn knockout mice
the basic strategy for ablating exon  <dig> was the same as for the kalirin7-specific exon  <cit> . the Δ isoforms of kalirin start at exon 11; exon  <dig> was chosen because exon  <dig> would have to be spliced to exon  <dig>  in the middle of the gef domain , to remain in the correct reading frame. lox-p sites were introduced  <dig>  kb upstream  and  <dig>  kb downstream of exon  <dig>  . the strategy for removing the neomycin resistance cassette using flipper mice, breeding the conditional knockout mice into c57bl/ <dig>  and eliminating exon  <dig> using hprt-cre females was as described  <cit> . mice with lox-p sites flanking exon  <dig> are referred to as kalirin spectrin repeat conditional knockout  mice; after cre-mediated excision of exon  <dig>  mice are referred to as kalirin spectrin repeat knockout  mice. both strains have been bred more than  <dig> generations into the c57bl/ <dig> background. kalsrcko/cko and kalsr+/cko mice are of normal weight, reproduce well and have an unaltered distribution and level of kalirin isoforms. kalsr+/ko mice were bred to obtain kalsrko/ko mice. kalsrcko/cko mice were crossed with c57bl/ <dig> mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the nestin promoter , to yield kalsrnesko mice; expression of cre recombinase outside of the nervous and endocrine systems is minimal in this mouse, with restricted expression in the vasculature .

behavioral studies
animals were group housed in the center for comparative medicine at the university of connecticut health center  with a  <dig> h light/dark cycle . all behavioral experiments were done in the scoville neurobehavioral suite in accordance with uchc institutional animal care and use committee and national institutes of health guidelines. male and female littermates  <dig> to  <dig> months of age were tested during the light phase. all animals were handled daily for at least  <dig> d before behavioral testing to minimize experimenter-induced stress. in addition, animals were allowed to habituate to the testing room for  <dig> h before testing. animals were evaluated using several behavioral tests; the less stressful tests preceded those that were more stressful . tests were separated by  <dig> or more days, and the same set of mice was used for all behavioral experiments. open field, elevated zero maze, passive avoidance, and object recognition  tests were performed as described  <cit> . briefly, open field behavior was assessed by recording beam breaks for nine five-minute time bins using a san diego instruments clear plexiglas chamber . naÃ¯ve mice were placed onto the elevated zero maze facing into the closed area and the time spent in the open area  was monitored for  <dig> min. passive avoidance behavior was monitored using a san diego instruments 2-chamber box; a  <dig>  ma ×  <dig> s scrambled footshock was delivered at the end of the training period, when the mouse was in the dark chamber. novel object recognition was performed by placing the mouse into a clean rat cage containing two falcon tubes or two legor objects and recording the time spent exploring each object over a three minute trial; the test was repeated the next day using the same object plus a novel object. the elevated zero maze and novel object recognition tests were videotaped and scored by a blinded observer. data for male and female mice were analyzed separately; when no difference was observed, data were pooled.

tail suspension
after taping the tail to a bent coat hanger, mice were suspended  <dig> cm above the floor of the cage for  <dig> min. mice were videotaped and total time spent immobile  was scored manually.

rotarod
training sessions  were conducted to acclimate the mice to the rotarod apparatus . motor coordination was assessed by measuring the length of time each mouse remained on the rotating rod as it accelerated from  <dig> to  <dig> rpm over a period of five min. on the 4th day, mice were tested in the same way three more times and the mean was used as the measure of competence at this task.

wire hang
two parallel steel wires  <dig> cm long and separated by  <dig> cm were anchored to the middle of a cardboard ; a  <dig> cm space separated the wires from the cardboard enabling a mouse to grip the wires with all four feet but not to climb onto the wires. the cardboard was suspended  <dig> cm above a rat cage containing bedding to prevent injury. mice were trained for  <dig> days; on the fourth day, time spent suspended from the wires was measured. on the testing day, each mouse underwent  <dig> trials and the mean value was used to determine wire hang time.

acute restraint stress
when behavioral testing was finished, mice were returned to their home cages for a week. blood collected via submandibular puncture two days prior to restraint stress was used for measuring basal serum corticosterone levels. restraint stress was performed between 10: <dig> am and noon by placing mice into ventilated 50-ml plastic tubes for  <dig> minutes. mice were then sacrificed by decapitation; serum prepared from trunk blood was stored at −80°c until assayed for corticosterone  and peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monoxygenase   <cit> .

prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response
male mice were subjected to acoustic startle testing and measurement of prepulse inhibition  using two identical startle chambers  essentially as described for rats  <cit> . mice were placed into a clear acrylic cylindrical chamber enclosed in a sound- and vibration-attenuating cabinet equipped with a  <dig> w bulb and ventilation fan. the chamber containing the mouse sits on a base that contacts a piezoelectric accelerometer that detects the whole body startle response. output signals from the accelerometer are collected as  <dig> sequential  <dig> msec measurements starting at the onset of the startling stimulus . mice were allowed five min of acclimation prior to delivery of the stimuli over a  <dig> db white noise background. the first and last six trials of the session consisted of the startle stimulus alone . trials occurred in a random order and consisted of  <dig> startle alone trials to calculate % ppi and  <dig> prepulse + startle trials at each of  <dig> prepulse intensities , and  <dig> no stimulus trials. prepulse stimuli  preceded startle stimuli by  <dig> ms. accelerometer signals were rectified and digitized using sr-lab . chambers were calibrated daily and matched for sound intensity  <cit> .

cardiovascular measurements
blood pressure was measured using a non-invasive coda tail-cuff blood pressure occlusion system . measurements were taken in a quiet area away from other activity. conscious animals were introduced into restraining chambers that were placed onto a preheated pad maintained at 30°c; tail temperature was measured using an infrared sensor and blood pressure measurements were initiated when tail temperature reached 30°c. mice were trained for three days and on the fourth day bp recordings were made. each measurement consisted of  <dig> acclimatization cycles followed by  <dig> blood pressure measurement cycles.

biochemical analyses
analysis of dna and rna
dna prepared from ear or tail snips  <cit>  was used for genotyping with the primers shown in figure 2b: a, tgtatgccttggaaacaggc; b, tgttttgccatcgggaggat; c, tgcaaggaacatcgggcttt. the annealing temperature was 51°c , elongation was at 72°c for  <dig> sec, repeated  <dig> times. tissue rna was prepared using trizol as described  <cit> . preparation of cdna, quantitative polymerase chain reaction  primers and conditions were as described for gapdh, kal <dig>  kal <dig>  kal <dig>  delta, and kal-spectrin  <cit> . new primers used in this study are shown in table  <dig> 

western blot analysis
tissue fragments were solubilized in sds lysis buffer  <cit>  with protease inhibitors added at  <dig> μg/ml . after solubilization at 95°c, extracts were cleared of insoluble debris by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g. solubilized protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard . sds-page and immunoblotting with enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as described  <cit> . rabbit antiserum jh <dig>  and affinity-purified rabbit antiserum jh <dig>   <cit>  were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg.

secretion of growth hormone  and prolactin 
pools of adult male or female mouse pituitaries were used to prepare cultures as described  <cit> . cells were plated at a density of  <dig>  pituitaries per well in a protamine coated  <dig> well plate. primary cells that had been maintained in culture for 2– <dig> days were pre-rinsed 2– <dig> times  with secretion medium . to measure basal secretion cells were fed with secretion medium for  <dig> min and the fraction was collected. following the basal collection, secretagogue stimulated secretion was initiated by adding medium containing  <dig> mm bacl <dig> and/or  <dig> μm phorbol myristate acetate  for  <dig> min. cells were harvested at the end of the secretion paradigm. spent media  and cell lysates  were subjected to sds-page and western blot analysis using antibodies to gh   <cit>  or prl ; cell content of hormone was normalized to γ-adaptin .

visualization of neuromuscular junctions and muscle fine structure
light microscopy
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  were visualized in tibialis and diaphragm muscle using α-bungarotoxin-tetramethylrhodamine  as described  <cit> . images were coded and neuromuscular junctions in tibialis muscle were categorized as normal  or open . our categorization was based on the criteria used to distinguish mature neuromuscular junctions from immature  junctions  <cit> ; each neuromuscular junction photographed en face was categorized as “normal” or “open” based on the number of discontinuities observed in its pretzel-like structure; we did not observe immature junctions in the adult tissue examined.

electron microscopy
animals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde  under deep anesthesia with ketamine/xylazine. after fixation, the diaphragm was dissected out and placed into 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for one hour. diaphragm muscle was then incubated in pbs containing fluorescently-labeled α-bungarotoxin  at 4°c overnight. neuromuscular junctions  were identified under a fluorescence microscope and areas with nmj’s were dissected out as 2mm cubes and processed for electron microscopy. the small cubes were further fixed with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde in  <dig> m sodium cacodylate buffer, ph  <dig>  at 4°c. the following day, tissue was rinsed with cacodylate buffer and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide,  <dig> % potassium ferricyanide in  <dig> m cacodylate buffer for 1h at room temperature. following standard procedures for dehydration, the tissues were embedded in spurr resin. ultrasections contrasted with uranylacetate were viewed on a hitachi h- <dig> transmission electron microscope and photographed. coded images of neuromuscular junctions and muscle were scored by a blinded observer. neuromuscular junctions with well defined boundaries containing neurotransmitter vesicles were considered for analysis. the number of neuromuscular junction folds per length of junction was measured using metamorph. the length of the sarcomere, a-band, i-band and z-band was measured using metamorph. data were obtained from three mice of each genotype.

statistical analyses
data are presented as average ± sem. statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism  <dig>   or spss software. data were analyzed using a t-test or one-way anova with bonferrroni correction as appropriate. two-way repeated measures anova was used to analyze the interaction between genotype and time in the open field or genotype and prepulse inhibition in the ppi test.

RESULTS
kalirin is expressed within and outside of the nervous system
although most studies exploring kalirin function have focused on its roles in the nervous system, its expression in skeletal muscle, liver and pituitary has been well documented  <cit> . we used several primer sets to compare kalrn isoform expression in cortex, skeletal muscle, pituitary, liver and aorta in adult c57bl/ <dig> mice using qpcr . cortex exhibited the expected pattern, with high expression of kalrn isoforms that include all or part of the spectrin repeat region and the exon unique to kalirin <dig>  expression of kalirin <dig> was barely detectable outside of the nervous system.

expression of kalrn isoforms amplified by primers within the unique kalirin <dig> 3′-untranslated region  or the gef <dig> domain  was prominent in pituitary, liver and aorta, which also contained high levels of kalrn transcripts that included all or part of the spectrin repeat region. adult skeletal muscle expressed kalrn transcripts amplified by kalirin <dig> primers. transcripts encoding kalrn isoforms that could include the sec14p domain  were notably absent from skeletal muscle and liver. northern blot analysis using probes specific for gef <dig> and kalirin <dig> revealed the presence of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb transcripts that could encode Δkalirin <dig> and kal duet <dig>  in liver polya+ rna . the interaction of kalirin with a secretory granule enzyme and the locomotor role of the c.elegans orthologue of kalrn led us to include evaluations of pituitary and muscle function in our examination of the kalsrko/ko mouse.

generation and validation of kalsrko/ko mice
we targeted exon  <dig> of the kalrn gene for elimination because splicing of exon  <dig> to any of the subsequent fifteen exons would yield an out-of-reading frame product. the strategy for eliminating exon  <dig> is outlined in figure 2a  <cit> . as shown in figure 2b, pcr analysis enabled monitoring of all of the expected genotypes from ear punches gathered when identifying weanlings. all pcr products were verified by dna sequencing. kalsrcko/cko mice were indistinguishable from wildtype c57bl/ <dig> mice. exon  <dig> was removed by breeding kalsrcko/+ males with hprt-cre females; these mice lack  <dig>  kb of chromosome  <dig> and retain one lox-p sequence.

kalsrko/ko mice were generated by mating kalsr+/ko mice and were viable. western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the spectrin-repeat region of kalirin confirmed the loss of kalirin <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from homogenates of adult cortex . a cross-reactive protein slightly smaller than Δkalirin <dig> was detected in the kalsrko/ko sample . to determine its identity, transcripts initiated from the Δ-promoter were cloned and sequenced using cortical mrna from kalsr+/ko mice. based on this analysis, the band indicated by # could be encoded by transcripts initiated from the Δ-promoter and lacking exon  <dig>  stop codons follow the first  <dig> aug  codons in these transcripts but a  <dig> kda protein lacking the first  <dig> residues of Δkalirin <dig>  replaced by  <dig> residues in a different reading frame, could be produced by translation that started at the sixth aug. to test this hypothesis, a kalirin7-specific antibody was used to analyze psds prepared from wildtype and kalsrko/ko cortex ; proteins the size of kalirin <dig> and Δkalirin <dig> were absent from the kalsrko/ko samples and a single product of the predicted mass was apparent. use of an antibody specific for the region unique to kalirin <dig> confirmed its loss from both the soluble and psd-enriched fractions of adult cortex .

we used qpcr to verify the elimination of transcripts containing kalrn exon  <dig> and to evaluate expression of transcripts initiated at the kalrn duet promoter, which is located in the intron preceding exon  <dig> . as expected, exon 13-containing transcripts were eliminated in all tissues examined . transcripts initiated at the duet promoter were not eliminated and were present in cortex, skeletal muscle and pituitary. kalsrko/ko mice lack kalrn transcripts initiated at five of the six major kalrn promoters. the consensus for nonsense-mediated decay is that mrnas are targeted for destruction when translating ribosomes encounter a stop codon followed within a short distance by a downstream splice site  <cit> . for kalirin transcripts initiated at the full-length sec14-promoters, the first stop codon produced by splicing exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> is not followed closely by a splice site; since these transcripts might not be subject to nonsense-mediated decay, it was expected that qpcr for the kalirin spectrin region  could yield normal levels in kalsrko/ko mice.

kalsrko/ko mice show deficits at parturition
once bred more than  <dig> generations into the c57bl/ <dig> background, the yield of pups from kalsr+/ko matings matched the expected mendelian 1:2: <dig> ratio . earlier in the process of breeding from a mixed 129/c <dig> background, the yield of kalsrko/ko pups was lower, as also seen with the kalirin7ko/ko mice  <cit> . although female kalsrko/ko mice carried litters to term, most could not give birth and died during parturition, in spite of oxytocin administration. kalsrko/ko dams that gave birth showed deficits in nesting, pup rearing and milk letdown.

weight data for wt and kalsrko/ko littermates were collected from weaning up to  <dig> years of age . a repeated measures general linear mixed model  was used to analyze the growth curves using the mixed procedure in sas   <cit> . in these models the unit of analysis is the mouse and each mouse contributes a set of weights over time. a compound symmetry covariance structure was fit. we tested for equality of intercepts  and slopes  for the wt and kalsrko/ko mice. male kalsrko/ko mice were not significantly smaller than wt mice at weaning  but grew at a slower rate, never attaining the normal growth curve  . female kalsrko/ko mice were smaller than wt mice at weaning , grew at a similar rate  but never attained the normal growth curve   <cit> .

cultured pituitary cells reveal cell autonomous deficits in basal secretion in kalsrko/ko
kalirin is known to play a pivotal role in secretory granule maturation and storage  <cit> . given these previous findings and the deficits in growth  and lactation, we used primary cultures to examine pituitary hormone secretion in kalsrko/ko mice. although anterior pituitary somatotropes from kalsrko/ko mice synthesized and stored growth hormone normally, basal secretion of growth hormone  was elevated compared to wt . in contrast, stimulation of secretion over basal levels by bacl <dig> or phorbol myristate acetate was unaltered . normal growth depends on pulsatile release of growth hormone  <cit> , which reflects both hypothalamic input and nutrient feedback; any disruption in the normal pattern could contribute to deficient growth.

prolactin secretion showed a similar genotypic difference, with increased basal secretion by kalsrko/ko lactotropes; since lactotropes in vivo are subject to tonic inhibition by dopamine, basal secretion of prl in cell culture is substantially higher than basal secretion of gh. kalsrko/ko and wildtype lactotropes did not differ in their ability to increase prolactin secretion over basal levels in response to bacl <dig> or pma .

similarities in blood pressure, ability to respond to stress and basal locomotor activity in wt and kalsrko/ko mice
since kalirin has been implicated in early onset cardiovascular disease  <cit> , resting blood pressure was evaluated in wt and kalsrko/ko mice; no significant differences were observed in this parameter, but fanaroff et al.  <cit>  have reported a role for kalrn in smooth muscle cell migration/proliferation and atherogenesis .

our earlier work on the role of kalrn in pituitary cells, deficits in peptidergic secretion in c. elegans expressing unc- <dig> mutants and deficits in basal growth hormone and prolactin secretion by pituitary cells lacking kalrn suggested that there might be widespread alterations in peptidergic secretion in kalsrko/ko mice. to evaluate this possibility, serum levels of a widely expressed secretory granule enzyme were monitored ; serum phm activity was identical in wt and kalsrko/ko mice. as another test of peptidergic function, restraint stress was used to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in kalsrko/ko mice ; secretion of both hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone and pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone is required for a normal response. neither basal levels of corticosterone nor the ability to secrete corticosterone in response to stress was altered in male or female kalsrko/ko mice; as expected, corticosterone levels rose higher in female than in male mice after restraint stress   <cit> .

since many of the behavioral tests to be conducted rely on locomotor activity, we evaluated spontaneous locomotor activity in an open field chamber for  <dig> min; there were no significant differences between wt and kalsrko/ko mice .

behavioral analysis of kalsrko/ko mice
kalrn has been genetically associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders; therefore a battery of behavioral tests was carried out on wt and kalsrko/ko mice. since kalirin <dig> is also absent in kalsrko/ko mice, we first used the tests that revealed deficits in the kal7ko/ko mice. wt, kalsrko/+ and kalsrko/ko mice were evaluated in the elevated zero maze; there was a clear effect of genotype on time spent in the open area, indicating a decrease in anxiety-like behavior . kalsrko/ko mice spent a significantly longer time in the open area of the elevated zero maze than wt mice . kalsr+/ko mice did not differ significantly from wt or kalsrko/ko mice .

since kalrn transcript and kalirin protein levels were reduced in hippocampi collected from alzheimers patients  <cit> , we wanted to test kalsrko/ko mice in hippocampal dependent tasks. passive avoidance conditioning tests hippocampus-dependent memory  <cit> . during the training session, wt, kalsr+/ko and kalsrko/ko mice showed the same latency to cross to the dark side of the chamber . when tested  <dig> h after receiving a single foot shock, it was clear that genotype had a significant effect on the response. kalsrko/ko mice exhibited a significantly decreased latency to cross to the foot shock-paired side relative to wt mice. once again, the kalsr+/ko mice exhibited a response intermediate to that of wt and kalsrko/ko mice.

kal7ko/ko mice performed normally in the radial arm maze and in tests of novel object recognition  <cit> . kalsrko/ko mice spent significantly more time exploring both objects on the pretest day than did wt mice . the total time spent exploring objects was also significantly higher for kalsrko/ko mice on the test day, but kalsrko/ko mice recognized the novel object as well as wt mice . the increased object exploration observed in kalsrko/ko mice may reflect their decreased anxiety-like behavior or may reflect impaired response habituation  <cit>  .

additional tests were used to evaluate the behavior of the kalsrko/ko mice. depression-like behavior was evaluated using the tail suspension test . there was no difference in immobility time for wt and kalsrko/ko mice.

prepulse inhibition is the decrease in startle response to an intense auditory stimulus that is preceded by a smaller auditory prepulse  <cit> . decreased kalrn mrna levels were reported in the prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia  <cit> , and ppi deficits due to altered sensory motor gating have been reported in schizophrenic patients and psychosis-prone individuals  <cit> . the startle response to pulse-alone trials in kalsrko/ko mice was significantly lower than in wt mice . contrary to our expectations, there was no significant difference between wt and kalsrko/ko mice in the prepulse induced inhibition of acoustic startle. however, the diminished startle response observed in the kalsrko/ko suggested a role for altered neuromuscular function, which was examined directly.

kalsrko/ko and kalsr+/ko mice show deficits in neuromuscular function
motor coordination was first tested using a rotarod; mice trained for three days were tested on the fourth day. both the kalsr+/ko and kalsrko/ko mice showed a decreased ability to perform this task relative to wt mice ; kalsrko/ko mice were more affected than kalsrko/+ mice. skeletal muscle function was further probed using a wire hang test. kalsr+/ko and kalsrko/ko mice showed a drastic reduction in their ability to suspend themselves from a wire compared to wt mice .

since kalrn is expressed in both motor neurons and skeletal muscle, the phenotype observed could result from the loss of kalrn expression in either or both cell types. in order to direct elimination of kalrn expression to the nervous system, kalsrcko/cko mice were mated with nestin-cre mice  <cit> . in these mice cre is broadly expressed throughout the central nervous system from early embryonic development through adulthood; restricted expression is also observed in the vasculature and scattered cells in a wide variety of tissues . kalsrnesko/nesko and control kalsrcko/cko mice were evaluated in the rotarod and wire hang tests. since kal7ko/ko mice would be expected to mimic neuron-specific elimination of kalrn expression, they were evaluated using the same tests. compared to kalsrko/ko mice, kalsrnesko/nesko mice exhibited less of a decrease in their ability to remain on the rotarod ; the performance of kal7ko/ko mice did not differ from that of wt mice in this test. in the wire hang test, kalsrnesko/nesko mice were indistinguishable from the kalsrcko/cko controls and did not exhibit the profoundly impaired performance observed in kalsrko/ko mice ; kal7ko/ko mice remained suspended from the wire for a longer time than wt mice.

kalsrko/ko mice show deficits in neuromuscular junction and muscle structure
in order to evaluate the structure of the neuromuscular junction, tibialis muscles from kalsrko/ko and wt mice were visualized after binding fluorescently tagged bungarotoxin to the nicotinic aceylcholine receptor . the expected compact, pretzel-like structures were consistently observed in wt muscle while a more open, less well organized pattern was common in the kalsrko/ko muscle. categorization using established criteria  <cit>  suggested a significant difference in the organization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction in kalsrko/ko mice .

for a more detailed, quantitative analysis, we turned to the diaphragm muscle; neuromuscular junctions were localized in fixed tissue and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. in both wt and kalsrko/ko mice, muscle fibers were well organized , with peripheral nuclei and normal mitochondrial content. sarcomere length was increased in kalsrko/ko mice, reflecting an increase in i-band length; a-band length was unaltered . z-line thickness was decreased in kalsrko/ko muscle.

neuromuscular junctions were identified based on the apposition of specialized regions of muscle membrane and nerve endings filled with synaptic vesicles and mitochondria  <cit> . well organized junctional folds closely apposed to nerve terminals filled with synaptic vesicles were readily found in wt tissue . in contrast, both the nerve terminals and junctional folds were disturbed in kalsrko/ko mice . the number of junctional folds/μm of synaptic membrane was quantified by a blinded observer and was decreased in the kalsrko/ko mice . in addition, mitochondria often accumulated in the presynaptic endings of kalsrko/ko mice. differences in both neuronal and muscle tissue may contribute to the altered rotarod and wire hang performance.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
genetic linkage studies and analyses of post-mortem tissue have associated human kalrn with a wide array of neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . detailed studies of the actions of kalirin <dig>  the major isoform in the adult nervous system, identified several pathways through which kalirin <dig> can participate in spine formation and synaptic plasticity  <cit> , but have not provided insight into the roles played by other kalirin isoforms within or outside of the nervous system. analysis of the c. elegans and d. melanogaster ortholog of kalrn revealed essential roles for this gene both within and outside of the nervous system  <cit> ; neither species has an isoform similar to kalirin <dig> 

functions unique to kalirin <dig> and kalirin12
kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> are expressed in skeletal muscle, pituitary, liver and aorta, but very little kalirin <dig> is expressed outside of the nervous system. the second gef domain of kalrn, which is present in kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig>  but absent from kalirin <dig>  activates rhoa, not rac <dig> or rhog. the downstream effectors of rac <dig> and rhoa are distinctly different  <cit>  and many of the disease-associated mutations identified in human kalrn map near the second gef domain  <cit> . in the fly and worm orthologs of kalrn, the rac- and rho-specific gef domains play different but essential roles  <cit> . this strongly suggests unique roles for the kalrn isoforms that contain the rho-specific gef <dig> domain. the gef <dig> domain of unc- <dig> plays a role in muscle contraction triggered through g protein coupled receptors signaling through gαq <cit> . structural analysis of a gαq-p63rhogef-rhoa complex indicates that gαq relieves the autoinhibitory effect of the ph domain; gαq also activates the gef <dig> domain of kalrn <cit> . interactions unique to kalirin <dig> have also been identified  <cit> ; the binding of dynamin to the ig/fn domain is consistent with a role for kalrn in endocytosis  <cit> . the fly and worm orthologs of kalrn lack a kinase domain and offer no insight into its potential roles.

by comparing the phenotypes of the different kalrn knockout mouse lines, we identified deficits caused by the loss of all of the kalirin isoforms that were not observed in mice lacking only kalirin <dig>  deficits observed in the kalsrko/ko mice but not in the kal7ko/ko mice presumably reflect the functions of kalirin <dig> and − <dig> both within and outside of the nervous system. deficits common to kalsrko/ko and kal7ko/ko mice reflect sites at which kalirin <dig> is expressed and its unique localization to the psd, where it can interact with pdz domain containing proteins.

deficits unique to kalsrko/ko mice
one of the most striking deficits unique to kalsrko/ko mice was their inability to perform in the rotarod and wire hang tests. that kalsr+/ko heterozygote mice also failed to perform normally in either test suggests that motor deficits are a sensitive indicator of compromised kalrn function. examination of the neuromuscular junction in kalsrko/ko mice revealed deficits in both the muscle and the presynaptic ending. a role for kalrn in muscle is consistent with findings in c. elegans <cit> . splice variants of unc- <dig> that resemble kal duet  <dig>  a mammalian isoform generated from the duet promoter, play essential roles in pharynx and vulval muscle  <cit> . in mammals, the duet promoter also yields kal duet  <dig>  which contains both a gef domain and an active kinase domain  <cit> .

the extensive signaling that occurs between skeletal muscle and the innervating motor neuron means that further experiments will be required to distinguish the roles of the different kalrn isoforms in these two tissues. kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> are the most prevalent isoforms in the brain during embryonic development, and exogenous kalirin <dig> or kalirin <dig> in superior cervical ganglion neurons stimulated the initiation, growth and branching of axons  <cit> . kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> decline when kalirin <dig> expression increases during the burst of synaptogenesis that occurs after birth  <cit> . kalirin <dig>  but not kalirin <dig> or kalirin <dig>  binds p <dig> and regulates p75-nogo receptor-dependent rhoa activation in cerebellar granule neurons in culture, inhibiting myelin formation  <cit> . in drosophila, dtrio interacts with notch, affecting axon sprouting and guidance  <cit> ; the gef <dig> domain, but not the gef <dig> domain, is essential for this interaction  <cit> . dtrio expressed in neurons is also a key component of the bmp retrograde signaling pathway used to coordinate pre- and post-synaptic development of the neuromuscular junction  <cit> .

kalsrnesko/nesko mice, which lack all isoforms of kalrn in the nervous system, exhibited a deficit in rotarod behavior but were not impaired to the same extent as kalsrko/ko mice; kal7ko/ko mice behaved like wt mice. thus it is clear that isoforms of kalrn expressed outside of the nervous system play an essential role in rotarod performance. since kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> are expressed in skeletal muscle, the deficit may be a direct result of their absence from muscle cells. a better understanding of the role of kalirin in skeletal muscle requires identifying the sites at which it is located. the clustering of receptors, ion channels and signaling proteins that occurs at the neuromuscular junction involves proteins similar to those involved in the formation of the psd and skeletal muscle kalirin could play a role in this process. the effect of kalirin on the z-line could be direct or indirect; many of the same proteins essential to spine formation and function participate in z-line formation. the increase in sarcomere length observed in kalsrko/ko diaphragm muscle arose from an increase in the length of the i-band, which consists of actin filaments whose pointed ends extend between the myosin filaments. the barbed ends of the anti-parallel actin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres meet at the z-line, which showed a decrease in width in kalsrko/ko mice. z-line width is thought to correlate with the layers of α-actinin that cross-link the anti-parallel actin filaments  <cit> . α-actinin, which binds to nmda receptors, is enriched at the psd; when over-expressed in hippocampal neurons, α-actinin increases the formation of long dendritic protrusions  <cit> .

while loss of kalirin expression in skeletal muscle may contribute to the inability of kalsrko/ko mice to perform in the wire hang test, it is clear that expression of kalirin <dig> in the nervous system also plays an important role in this behavioral response. kal7ko/ko mice remained suspended from the wire for a far longer time than wt mice, suggesting that central control of skeletal muscle has been altered. the kalsrnesko/nesko mice exhibit a response intermediate to that of kalsrko/ko and kal7ko/ko mice and similar to that of kalsrcko/cko mice. the many pathways through which the cns controls skeletal muscle contraction make it impossible to identify the sites at which kalirin <dig> plays an essential role, but it is not uncommon for mouse mutants to show differential susceptibility to changes in performance in the wire hang and rotarod tests  <cit> .

the novel object recognition test revealed an intriguing difference between kalsrko/ko and kal7ko/ko mice; while kalsrko/ko mice spent more total time exploring the objects than wt mice, kal7ko/ko mice did not. this difference suggests that kalirin <dig> and/or kalirin <dig> contribute to this behavior. the age dependent hyperactive behavior reported in kalgef1ko/ko mice  <cit>  may be similar to the enhanced exploration of both familiar and novel objects seen with the kalsrko/ko mice, and may reflect the absence of kalirin <dig> and/or kalirin <dig>  due to the absence of kalirin isoforms that include the gef <dig> domain, the functioning of pathways that rely on gpcr signaling through gαq to rhoa may be impaired. both cholinergic signaling through m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> muscarinic receptors  <cit>  and serotonergic signaling through 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors involve gαq <cit> .

a role for kalirin in secretory granule release was expected from previous studies using pituitary cells in culture  <cit> , from the fact that kalirin was first identified through its interaction with a secretory granule membrane protein and from the altered neurotransmitter release observed in worms and flies  <cit> . the increased basal secretion of prl and gh observed in kalsrko/ko pituitary cells in culture may underlie the growth deficits in the animal, since elevated gh without the normal periodicity in its secretion contributes to stunted growth in experimental animals and across the human population  <cit> . altered basal secretion of peptides could be expected to contribute to other deficits observed in kalsrko/ko mice, especially at the neuromuscular junction.

deficits common to kalsrko/ko and kal7ko/ko mice
a similar decrease in baseline anxiety-like behavior was seen in both kalsrko/ko and kal7ko/ko mice. kalsrko/ko mice and kal7ko/ko mice also exhibited comparably impaired passive avoidance behavior. since kal7ko/ko mice produce slightly increased amounts of kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> compared to wt mice  <cit> , we think it likely that a lack of kalirin <dig> causes the changes observed in the affected pathways. it is clear that kalirin <dig> plays an essential role in the formation and function of excitatory synapses on dendritic spines. both nmda receptor dependent ltp and ltd are deficient in kal7ko/ko mice  <cit> . in the absence of kalirin <dig>  chronic cocaine treatment is unable to increase the size or the number of spines on the dendrites of medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens  <cit> . in hippocampal cultures, a decrease in kalirin <dig> expression both reduced the density of excitatory synapses and the ability of estadiol to increase synapse formation  <cit> .

expression of kalirin in the amygdala, one of the regions that plays a critical role in anxiety-like behavior and passive avoidance, is not notably different from expression levels elsewhere in the brain, but region or cell-type specific differences in the expression of key interactors may determine which pathways are most sensitive to a decrease in kalirin <dig> levels. many of proteins identified in a screen for kalirin <dig> pdz binding motif interactors are known to be involved in the clustering of nmda and ampa receptors   <cit> . other interactors link kalirin <dig> to filamentous actin , a key determinant of spine shape and thus of spine function. of special interest, given the role of serotoninergic transmission in anxiety and fear, is mupp <dig>  which binds to both kalirin <dig> and to the 5ht2a and 5ht2c receptors  <cit> .

kalirin <dig>  kalirin <dig> and kalirin <dig> share the ability to interact with a wide variety of proteins including peptidylglycine α-amidating monoxygenase   <cit> , disc- <dig>  <cit> , trkb  <cit> , inducible nos  <cit> , nr2b  <cit>  and phosphoinositides  <cit>  through their common sec <dig>  spectrin repeat and gef <dig> domains.

manipulating kalrn to study psychiatric/neurological disorders
kalrn has been linked to schizophrenia and adult adhd, and mouse models for these diseases would be of great use. patients suffering from a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and huntington’s disease often exhibit deficits in prepulse inhibition  <cit> . the linkage of kalrn to schizophrenia and the interaction of kalirin with disc- <dig> made prepulse inhibition, which can be modeled in rodents  <cit> , of particular interest. however, in a test of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, kalsrko/ko mice showed no sensorimotor deficits; kalsrko/ko mice evinced a decreased startle response in the pulse alone trials, demonstrating deficits in their baseline startle response. while kalgef1ko/ko mice showed reduced prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle relative to wt mice  <cit> , neither the wt nor the kalgef1ko/ko mice showed the expected intensity dependence of prepulse induced inhibition  <cit> . the fact that both wt and kalsrko/ko mice showed a graded increase in inhibition of acoustic startle with increasing prepulse intensity supports the conclusion that ablation of kalrn did not result in a hearing or response deficit. several studies have noted significant co-morbidity of neuromuscular deficits and schizophrenia  <cit> , which might be associated with deficits in kalrn.
