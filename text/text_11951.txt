BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas participate in a variety of processes from cell development and differentiation, stress responses to carcinogenesis by regulating gene expression  <cit> . regulatory non-coding rnas have been reported from almost all organisms from bacteria to mammals  <cit> . among the various classes of non-coding small rnas , the most conserved and prominent ones are the micrornas or mirnas . mature mirna sequences are single stranded, typically 18- <dig> nucleotides long and encoded as a precursor molecule of about 60- <dig> nucleotides   <cit> . these precursors are derived from processing pri-mirna  by a ribonuclease, such as drosha  <cit> . pre-mirnas are also further cleaved to generate active mature mirnas with the help of dicer  <cit> . so far more than  <dig> mirnas have been described in human  <cit> . mirnas interact with 3'utr of mrnas through base pairing and bring about their degradation, destabilization, or repression of translation through risc, a complex of multiple proteins and mirna-mrna adduct  <cit> . occasionally it can also up regulate gene expression  <cit> .

the expression profiles of mirnas have been determined in order to understand the role of mirnas in a specific biological process  <cit> . the profiles generated revealed altered levels of mirnas in different systems, such as oncogenesis and development  <cit> . these studies showed strong correlation between specific mirna expression and phenotype suggesting it can be used as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in human cancer  <cit> . several groups of mirnas have been identified that regulate the expression of tumor-associated genes while others seem to hold prognostic value in predicting patient survival. for example, mir- <dig> is frequently over expressed in various cancers  <cit> . it is now considered as an oncomir that acts by down regulating pten, a tumor suppressor gene  <cit> . similarly let- <dig> family of mirnas is frequently down regulated in lung cancers  <cit> . mir-15a and 16- <dig> are often deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> . these mirnas target ras, hmga <dig> and bcl <dig> oncogenes, respectively, thereby regulating tumorigenesis  <cit> . expression of let-7a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> clusters was demonstrated to be a strong prognostic marker for lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively  <cit> . many of the fundamental processes are regulated by mirnas, such as cell differentiation   <cit> , apoptosis   <cit> , body patterning   <cit> , nervous system and muscle development   <cit> .

a number of different approaches have been used for expression profiling, such as northern analysis  <cit> , cloning  <cit> , real time polymerase chain reaction  <cit> , microarray analysis  <cit>  and rnase protection assay  <cit> . these methods are not generally useful for discovery and expression profiling of low-abundance transcripts or yet unidentified novel mirnas. recently a number of different platforms have been developed for carrying out large scale parallel sequencing in order to generate genome wide sequences in a short time and reduced cost  <cit> . these have also been applied to analyze transcriptome including srna sequences  <cit> . generally sequences derived using these platforms can be processed to generate expression profiles of known genes and suitable computational methods can be employed to identify unknown genes. some of these platforms along with custom computation pipelines have been used to study srnas from different systems, such as plants, human embryonic cells and developing chicken embryo  <cit> . all these studies not only generated expression profiles of known mirnas but also identified a few novel mirnas. morin et al. used this strategy in combination with rnafold, mipred and an in house svm model to identify novel mirnas  <cit> . though the study identified  <dig> novel mirnas there was no attempt to verify these by other experiments. a software pipeline mirdeep has been developed to analyze large-scale srna sequencing data and identification of novel mirnas  <cit> . some of the filters used in this approach are highly stringent and it is likely that many novel mirnas may be missed. generation of expression profiles and identification of novel mirnas from deep sequencing is dependent on tools used for analysis. it appears from this discussion that there is a need for development of efficient automated pipelines for analysis of deep sequencing data and setting up validation pipeline for checking the results, as newer algorithms may allow improved profiling and identification of novel mirnas.

in this manuscript we have profiled srna expression from normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and two cancer cell lines using solexa technology and developed automated computation pipelines for analyzing quantitative expression. our pipelines use statistical analysis of the solexa sequences for generation of expression profiles and a number of different methods for prediction of novel mirnas. we believe that these pipelines are highly robust and can be useful for other studies.

RESULTS
sequencing and annotation of small rnas
srnas were size selected by gel electrophoresis and then sequenced using a solexa platform . the details of sequencing reads of the four samples are given in additional file  <dig>  the length of an average read was about 33- <dig> nucleotides. the processing of the raw sequences through computation pipeline is outlined in figure  <dig> and described in "methods". briefly, the adaptor sequences were first removed from the sequence reads. only those reads that were greater than  <dig> nucleotides were considered for further analysis. these sequences were clustered on the basis of sequence similarity and subjected to similarity searches using specific databases . the reads that did not match known rna sequences were checked to see if these were encoded by intergenic, intronic or exonic regions of the human genome .

sequencing reads derived from mrnas and rrnas made up about 2- <dig> and 2-13% of the total reads of all the samples, respectively except that from k <dig> cells. since mrnas and rrnas are likely to have been derived by degradation it appears that the degradation was minimal in these samples. the sequencing reads derived from mirnas were estimated to be about 60-80%, similar to some of the other studies on srnas  <cit> . the result from k <dig> was quite different. only about 18% of total srna population was found to be derived from mirna. low level of mirnas in k <dig> cells is unlikely to be due to artifact as we got similar values in two independent experiments . out of a total of  <dig> mirnas  present in mirbase version  <dig>   <dig> mirnas were detected in at least one of the four samples sequenced  <cit> . a total of  <dig> mirnas were not detected in any of the samples.

microrna expression patterns
absolute sequence reads were transformed into transcript abundance by first normalizing the data in 'transcripts per million ' for each library . the expression levels ranged from less than  <dig> to more than  <dig>  counts . thus the sequencing data revealed a wide range of expression levels spanning five orders of magnitude. several members of the let- <dig> family,  <dig>   <dig> and 320a were observed as some of the highly expressed mirnas . these mirnas were also reported as highly abundant mirnas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using "taqman microrna assay"  <cit> . while the members of let- <dig> family, let-7a, f and g represented about 77% of the total mirna counts, a number of mirnas with less than  <dig> counts including singletons were also noticed . it is not clear if the singletons represent true transcript or noise of the system. mir-219-5p was one of the singletons found in all the four samples suggesting that such sequences may not be due to experimental noise or a chance event. star sequences of many mirnas  were also observed mostly at low abundance level. some of the highly abundant star sequences observed by us were mir-106-b* ; mir-17* ; mir-92a-1* , mir- 25* , and mir-374a* . the results suggest that srna sequencing is a good approach for studying mirna* abundance.

expression patterns of mirna clusters
mirnas are often present in gene clusters and it is generally believed that individual mirnas are generated from common polycistronic transcript by post - transcriptional processing  <cit> . since the genes in clusters are co-regulated and co-transcribed it is expected that the levels of these mirnas are likely to be similar. this was investigated by checking the relative levels of individual mirnas present in clusters using the expression patterns derived from deep sequencing. a total of  <dig> mirna genes organized in  <dig> clusters were studied. as the sequencing reads represent mainly mature mirnas and not individual precursors, it was not possible to analyze some of the clusters, such as those containing mir-15a, 16- <dig> and 15b, 16- <dig> that encode different precursors but the same mature mirna. furthermore,  <dig> clusters were also excluded from analysis as the mirnas encoded in these clusters were either not expressed or expressed below  <dig> tpm based on our data. therefore in this study results from analysis of only  <dig> clusters are shown .

the level of expression of different mirnas in many clusters displayed variable expression as exemplified by the cluster containing mir- <dig> and 99b . in some cases the variation observed within a cluster was as much as  <dig> fold and the mirna that showed highest level of expression was not the one closest to the transcription start site. for example, mir- <dig> showed highest expression though it was farthest from the start site in mir-106b cluster . this is likely to be due to variation in processing mechanisms at post - transcriptional level as has been seen in case of p53-mediated alteration in processing some of the mirnas, such as mir-16- <dig>  <cit> . overall the results suggest that the levels of mirnas in any cell may be regulated by a number of different processes and mechanistic details of many of these are not yet known.

differentially regulated mirnas in k <dig> and hl60
microarray based methods have been used extensively to profile expression levels of annotated genes at genomic scale. these methods cannot be used satisfactorily for analyzing expression levels of unknown transcripts. deep sequencing of cellular rnas is an alternative approach for deciphering expression profiles of genes  <cit> . though a few reports describing analysis of differentially expressed mirnas deciphered by deep sequencing are available, there is no study yet on human pbmc. moreover, there is no standardized tool available for profiling mirna expression using deep sequencing of srna  <cit> . therefore we have studied normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two different individuals and cancer cells of myeloid lineage, k <dig>  and hl <dig>  by deep sequencing of srnas followed by analysis of the sequences using a custom designed computation pipeline. we used intersection of two methods for finding differentially expressed genes; a) sam  that allows for the control of false detection rate  and b) fold change, that is, mirnas that showed more than  <dig>  fold differences when compared to both normal samples. a list of differentially regulated mirnas is shown . interestingly, mir- <dig>   <dig>  106b, 146b-5p, 151-3p,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  27b, 30e and 361-3p displayed low expression in both the cell lines indicating a common role in leukemia genesis or progression . in k <dig> most of the mirnas were down regulated except mir-486-3p and mir- <dig>  the expression patterns derived from srna sequences were validated by rnase protection assay  which allowed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of rna levels  <cit> . down regulation of expression of some of the mirnas, such as mir- <dig>   <dig>  27a,  <dig> and let-7g in cml cell line k <dig> was observed using rpa assay . rnu6b was used as a loading control, for all the samples. we have also used quantitative rt-pcr for validating some of the results derived by deep sequencing and rpa. fold differences in the expression of some of the differentially expressed genes in normal and k <dig> cells  using all three methods were found to be comparable indicating quantitative nature of these approaches .

while mir- <dig> was found to be one of the down regulated mirnas in our study, it is expressed at high level in all the cancers tested till date indicating that mirna expression is likely to be cell type and context dependent  <cit> . reduced expression of some of the mirnas, such as mir- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was previously reported in cml  <cit> . up regulation of the polycistronic mir-17- <dig> cluster in cd34+ cells of cml patients was initially described by venturini et al.,  <dig> and later was challenged by agirre et al.,  <dig>  <cit> . according to the latter group there is no significant increase in the expression of this cluster in cml cells. we too did not observe any induction of this cluster in k <dig> cell line in agreement with the latter group.

a significant number of differentially expressed mirnas of hl <dig>  were mapped to chromosome  <dig> . differential expression of mir-181a family  was previously reported  <cit> . some of the differentially regulated mirnas of k <dig>  such as mir- <dig>  mir-27b and mir- <dig> were also encoded by chromosome  <dig>  the genomic locations of some of these mirnas were distant from the abl gene locus. alterations in chromosome  <dig> are associated with a large number of diseases, particularly cancer  <cit> . therefore, there may be a link between alterations in chromosome  <dig> and differential expression of mirnas.

predicted targets of differentially regulated mirnas
identification of putative targets may help to understand the biological role of the differentially regulated mirnas. in this study two different approaches were used for target identification. in the first approach a number of different software tools were employed for target prediction and in the second approach mrna expression profiles were generated and the genes that showed inverse correlation with mirna expression were identified. the second approach is based on a number of observations where target mrna degradation by mirnas were reported  <cit> . for computational prediction stringent criteria, that is, only those genes that are predicted to be target of specific mirnas by at least five of the eleven established target prediction programs  integrated by mirecords and also showed expression levels that are inversely correlated with the specific mirna levels were considered  <cit> . putative targets of differentially regulated mirnas are shown in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . genes targeted by three or more mirnas are shown in table  <dig>  genes that are targets of multiple mirnas are likely to be tightly regulated and may show graded response on the basis of expression of different mirnas  <cit> . meis <dig>  up regulated in k <dig>  was found to be the target of up to five different mirnas, down regulated in both k <dig> and hl <dig>  meis <dig> has been previously reported to be important for myeloid leukemogenesis  <cit> . similarly, smad <dig> a down regulated gene in hl <dig> is predicted to be a target of three mirnas, up regulated in hl <dig>  it is known that smad <dig> regulates smad and mitogen activated kinase  signaling and controls erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation of erythroleukemia cells  <cit> . trib <dig>  multiply targeted by three up regulated mirnas in hl <dig> has been reported to be present at low levels in aml  <cit> .

expression of intronic mirnas
many intron-encoded mirnas are processed in drosha independent way   <cit> . we have also analysed expression levels of differentially regulated intronic mirnas. in order to check if differential expression of intronic mirnas is due to transcriptional or post - transcriptional mechanisms, the levels of intronic mirnas were compared with that of the host transcripts. comparative analysis revealed positive correlations with respect to  <dig> out of  <dig> intronic mirna - mrna pairs . unlike mirnas in clusters, the expression of some of the intronic mirnas may be transcriptionally controlled.

mirna biogenesis machinery
the analysis of microarray data revealed induction in the expression of some of the mirna biogenesis genes  in k <dig> cell line . however, dicer <dig> was found to be down regulated . this would result in a likely increase in the pre-mirna population in cytosol but decrease in accumulation of mature mirnas. this is consistent with the observation that k <dig> cells contain relatively less amount of mirnas and that  <dig> out of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas are down regulated . this observation was not due to artifact as two independent sequencing of srnas from k <dig> cells gave similar results . low dicer and let- <dig> levels were also observed in lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . in contrast, a higher level of dicer <dig> in prostate adenocarcinoma accounted for up regulation of  <dig> of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas  <cit> . in hl <dig> some of the components of biogenesis machinery  were found to be up regulated.

identification of novel microrna genes
in principle deep sequencing of srnas should generate sequences from as yet unannotated regions of the genome. the analysis of the sequences through computational pipeline  showed a large number of unannotated sequences that are encoded by either intergenic or intronic regions. since mirnas are predominantly encoded by intergenic and intronic regions, these sequences were analyzed by a set of computational tools to identify putative novel mirnas. since predictions are based on identifying mirna precursors, genomic regions  surrounding the srna sequences were extracted . a total of  <dig>  novel mirnas were predicted using computational pipeline . the sequences and chromosomal locations of the predicted novel mirnas from intronic and intergenic regions are listed in the supplementary table . more than 95% of the novel mirnas showed frequency counts lower than  <dig>  many novel mirnas in our dataset showed presence of 1- <dig> isomirs with varying frequencies. for example, frequencies ranging from 1- <dig> were observed for eight isomirs of jnuhsa- <dig>  presence of isomirs certainly strengthens classification of these molecules as novel mirnas  <cit> . these datasets were also analyzed using mirdeep, a published tool for mirna analysis of deep sequencing data  <cit> . the number of novel mirnas predicted by mirdeep is much less than that using the pipeline described here . this may be due to stringent criteria used by mirdeep that quite often misses known mirnas. the expression of a few novel mirnas, missed by mirdeep but predicted by "in-house tools", was validated through real-time pcr  or rnase protection assay  as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly mirnas that were present as singleton  were also detected using rnase protection assay . we also mapped predicted novel mirnas to clusters based on the inter-mirna distance of less than  <dig> kb . some of the clusters contained only novel mirnas while many others were part of previously known clusters  <cit> . based on mirdeep prediction a total of  <dig> novel mirnas showed similarity in the seed region with the known mirnas indicating that these mirnas are likely to belong to the same family and thus may share common biology .

discussion
our effort to understand the micrornaome of human leukocytes through deep sequencing technology has given us several interesting observations. these include discovery of novel mirnas and a valuable list of differentially expressed mirnas in chronic and acute myelogenous leukemia. the diversity in the mirna wealth was realized through the detection of large number of novel mirnas. our major findings are a list of expressed mirnas  in leukocytes and the discovery that the expression of mirnas may be controlled by regulating post - transcriptional events, such as manipulating the level of dicer, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of mirnas in tumor cells . generally, singletons in the sequenced samples are not taken into consideration, as these are likely to occur due to potential sequencing error or transcription noise  <cit> . our experimental results show convincingly that such mirnas are likely to be real and not a result of artifact of sequencing.

the known mirnas found to be most abundant in all the four samples were members of the let- <dig> family,  <dig>   <dig> and 320a, which were also reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using "taqman microrna assay"  <cit> . therefore our results are in agreement with previous studies based on a different methodology. there are multiple mechanisms that are likely to regulate mirna levels similar to that of mrnas. these include both transcriptional and post - transcriptional processes. it is generally believed that levels of mirnas are regulated transcriptionally  <cit> . in this study an attempt was made to understand the role of different mechanisms in controlling mirna levels by studying levels of individual mirnas present in clusters and intronic mirnas. it is expected that all mirnas in a cluster belong to one transcription unit and are supposed to be synthesized as one long precursor  <cit> . since many mirnas of a cluster showed variable expression patterns it is likely that the levels are controlled using post - transcriptional mechanisms. therefore, regulation of post - transcriptional processing may be a preferred mechanism, instead of transcription control in case of mirnas present in clusters. studies describing the role of post - transcriptional mechanism in regulating levels of a number of mirnas have been recently published  <cit> . on the other hand our results regarding relative levels of intronic mirna and the host mrnas do indicate that the levels of many intronic mirnas are regulated at transcriptional level.

the isomirs of different mirnas were also frequently found suggesting that these do not arise due to rare events. as 5' and 3' ends of mature mirnas are defined by processing from drosha and dicer, respectively, it is likely that isomirs with extra nucleotides at the 5' end comes from variation in drosha processing while with extra bases at the 3' end comes from variation in dicer processing. another possibility is processing of mature mirna ends by yet an unidentified end-processing enzyme in the nucleus. whether the extra nucleotides of isomirs affect the target recognition needs to be evaluated.

a number of differentially expressed mirnas and their potential targets were identified by comparing mirna and mrna levels of normal pbmc versus that of two myeloid cancer cell lines k <dig> and hl <dig> along with computation approach. this strategy was used as degradation of many mrnas was observed as a result of mirna action  <cit> . both k <dig> and hl <dig> have been used as reference cell lines for studying the cellular and molecular events involved in the proliferation and differentiation of chronic myeloid or acute promyelocytic leukemia, respectively. many mirnas that were previously reported to be involved as tumor suppressors, such as let- <dig> g, mir- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to be down regulated in the leukemia cell lines. many of the differentially regulated mirnas, identified in this study have been reported to be involved in various cellular processes like cell cycle   <cit> , apoptosis   <cit>  differentiation   <cit>  dna repair   <cit>  metastasis  <cit> , erythroid maturation   <cit> , erythropoiesis   <cit>  and hematopoiesis   <cit> ; highlighting their putative role in leukemogenesis or progression. strikingly, majority of the differentially regulated mirnas were found to be down regulated in k <dig> cell line. it is possible that low level of dicer, as revealed by gene expression profiling, is responsible for an overall reduction in the mirna population. global down regulation of mirnas in mouse t cells using pcr and conventional sequencing approach was reported before  <cit> . however, the cause of the down regulation was not clear, as mrna profiling was not carried out. dicer has also been implicated in mouse t cell functions  <cit> . our studies strongly suggest that there may be a link between dicer and mirna levels. many of the genes, identified in this study as the potential targets of differentially regulated mirnas are known to be involved in cancer through their effects on cell differentiation , apoptosis  or hematopoiesis   <cit> . interestingly, majority of the targets of the cancer-associated mirnas, such as -arhgef, cdk <dig>  etv <dig>  gata <dig>  pim <dig>  lifr, tal <dig>  pparg, ranbp <dig>  tfrc foxp <dig> lpp, ncoa <dig> and nr4a <dig> have been previously shown to be associated with leukemogenesis.

one of the features of this study is the computation pipeline that identifies novel mirnas among srna sequences. this pipeline is different from other available pipelines as it has custom designed tools for identification of novel mirnas that involve pre-processing of the sequences, an exhaustive elimination pipeline, folding and filtering to get novel predictions. the evidences supporting the predictions are identification of potential precursors by specific precursor identification tools, presence of star sequences, presence of isomirs and in some cases experimental validation. the fact that even a single sequence read may not be a noise or error, has been validated by observing corresponding srna experimentally and indicates the power of our computation pipeline in identification of novel mirnas. the total number of novel mirnas identified from all the four samples is  <dig>  therefore, total number of mirnas encoded by the human genome may be much larger than current estimate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we list about  <dig> mirnas that are expressed in normal and cancerous leukocytes, nearly 41% of these are novel. our analysis shows that some of the novel mirnas are likely to be clustered in the genome similar to many known clusters of mirnas. moreover, we have also identified a number of mirnas that are differentially expressed in cancer cells studied by us. these are likely to be new markers/cause of carcinogenesis. in addition we show that mirna levels can be regulated at post - transcriptional processing stage. our results also show that singletons in deep sequencing reads are unlikely to be sequencing artifacts. in k <dig> cells low levels of mirnas is correlated with reduced level of the enzyme dicer. in addition we have developed an improved automated computation pipeline for analysis of deep sequencing data to obtain quantitative profiles of known and novel mirnas. based on our observations, it is now possible to generate leukocyte specific mirna arrays in order to study expression profiles of all mirnas relevant to leukocytes. similar approach can be used to generate other tissue specific mirnaome.
