BACKGROUND
exogenous sulfide, a common environmental toxin, harms organisms by reducing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen  <cit> , inhibiting the cytochrome c and succinate oxidase complexes  <cit> , depolarizing mitochondria  <cit> , inducing apoptosis  <cit> , and causing oxidative damage to rna and dna  <cit> . moreover, sulfide is produced by mammals in vivo  <cit>  and endogenous sulfide is involved in multiple physiological functions, including inflammation  <cit> , up-regulation of the antioxidant system  <cit> , and activation of katp channels  <cit> . thus, exploring the physiological effects of sulfide and organismal sulfide tolerance mechanisms is important.

responses to sulfide exposure are distinct in different organisms. the nematode caenorhabditis elegans survives in the presence 50 ppm sulfide, which increases its thermotolerance and lifespan  <cit> . mice exposed to 80 ppm sulfide enter a hibernation-like state to overcome the conditions inducing a low metabolic rate and decreased core body temperature without any apparent ill effects  <cit> . organisms living in sulfide-rich habitats adopt a variety of defensive responses to avoid prolonged toxic exposure to sulfide; for example, endosymbiotic bacteria sulfide metabolism and mitochondrial sulfide oxidation are two primary strategies for sulfide tolerance in invertebrates  <cit> . the hydrothermal vent tube worm riftia pachyptila and the clam solemya velum use hemoglobin to deliver sulfide to their endosymbiotic bacteria . metatranscriptome pyrosequencing of the endosymbiotic bacteria of the clam s. velum revealed  <dig> genes involved in diverse pathways associated with sulfide metabolism, including the dissimilatory sulfite reductase pathway, the adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate pathway and the sulfur oxidation pathway  <cit> . for some species that lack endosymbionts, such as echiuran worm urechis unicinctus, mitochondrial sulfide oxidation is important for their survival in sulfide-rich habitats, and several key enzymes, including sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase , sulfur dioxygenase , and sulfur transferase , play important roles in sulfide detoxification ; however, due to the lack of sufficient high-throughput molecular data, the full complement of genes and signalling pathways involved in sulfide tolerance and utilization and the mechanisms that regulate these pathways are unknown.

the echiuran worm, u. unicinctus, inhabiting “u-shaped” burrows in intertidal and subtidal mudflats, is widely distributed in russia, japan, the korean peninsula and china, which belongs to phylum echiura, a special group of invertebrate protostomes. preliminary studies have been presented that the worm u. unicinctus is able to metabolize exogenous sulfide and utilize it as energy . moreover, characterizations of the key genes for mitochondrial sulfide oxidation  have been revealed. here, a high-throughput methods—digital gene expression  technique was conducted to analyze the transcriptional response to sulfide in u. unicinctus. before the dge analysis, the transcriptome data of u. unicinctus is necessary, so we performed a large-scale transcriptome sequencing of u. unicinctus by illumina hiseqtm  <dig> platform  to obtain the first version of the u. unicinctus transcriptome.

the aims of the present study are to  characterize the u. unicinctus transcriptome;  identify the genes and signalling pathways responding to sulfide in u. unicinctus. the results will provide a comprehensive understanding for further exploring the molecular mechanism of sulfide metabolism in u. unicinctus.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis
a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw pe reads in the fastq format were generated with a length of 2 × 90 bp, which have been deposited in the ncbi database . after removing the low quality reads, we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality pe reads for optimizing the de novo assembly and analysis of the u. unicinctus transcriptome. the gc content, q <dig>  and unknown bases were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively . assembly of the  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads generated  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 337 bp, ranging from  <dig> to 5279 bp . approximately 75 %  of the high-quality reads contributed to the assembly of the contigs. among these contigs,  <dig>   were longer than 200 bp, and  <dig>   were longer than 500 bp. as expected for a randomly fragmented transcriptome, a positive relationship was determined between the length of a given contig and the number of reads mapped into it . furthermore, these contigs were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 738 bp and an n <dig> of 1131 bp, ranging from  <dig> to 7184 bp . an overview of the sequencing and assembly process is presented in table  <dig> table  <dig> output statistics of sequencing

in this study,  <dig>  gene sequences  returned an above cut-off blast result, and  <dig>  % of the assembled sequences could be matched to the known proteins. there were  <dig> mapped sequences  with high homology  in the nr database, whereas the others ranged from 10− <dig> to 10− <dig> . more than 21 % of the total sequences had a similarity that was higher than 60 %, while the rest ranged from  <dig> % to 60 % . moreover,  <dig>  % of the distinct sequences had top matches with those from branchiostoma floridae, which was followed by saccoglossus kowalevskii  and strongylocentrotus purpuratus  .fig.  <dig> characteristics of the homology search of illumina sequences against the nr database. a e-value distribution of blast hits for each unique sequence with a cut-off e-value of 10− <dig>  b similarity distribution of the top blast hits for each sequence. c the species distribution is shown as a percentage of the total homologous sequences with an e-value of at least 10− <dig>  we use the first hit of each sequence for analysis



cog  analysis showed that  <dig> unigenes were classified into  <dig> categories assigned by cog . in this classification, the largest group was involved in the general function, containing  <dig> unigenes , which was followed by translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis ; replication, recombination and repair ; transcription , carbohydrate transport and metabolism ; and posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones . only  <dig> unigenes  belong to the nuclear structure, which was the smallest group.fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of clusters of orthologous group  classification. out of  <dig>  annotated sequences,  <dig> sequences have a cog classification among the  <dig> categories



go  analysis showed that a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were assigned at least one go term. the transcripts were divided into  <dig> functional groups within the following three ontologies: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. for the biological process, the most representations were for cellular process  and metabolic process ; the cell , cell part  and organelle  for the cellular component; and the binding  and catalytic activity  for the molecular function, respectively. only  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were predicted to act in the functional group electron carrier and translation regulator activity, which were the smallest two parts .fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of the gene ontology classification. the results are summarized in the following three main categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. the right y-axis indicates the number of genes in a category. the left y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes in that main category



kegg  pathway analysis showed that  <dig>  unigenes  were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. of these, metabolic pathways contained  <dig> unigenes and were no doubt larger than other pathways, such as pathways in focal adhesion , cancer  and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . approximately 18 % of the unigenes were related to such pathways as immunity, stress, and growth.

dge library sequencing and tag mapping
to investigate the transcriptome profile of u. unicinctus in response to sulfide at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h, dge analysis was performed. there were a total of  <dig> – <dig>  million raw tags. after removing the adaptor tags and the low-quality tags, more than 95 % of the raw tags were retained, including  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean tags for the control, 6-h, 24-h and 48-h libraries, respectively . these results suggested that the sequencing data were of sufficient quality for subsequent analysis.table  <dig> dge sequencing statistics

the raw data are tags obtained from sequencing without processing. the clean tags are tags that remained after filtering out dirty  tags from the raw data. the distinct tags are tags that do not overlap. the unambiguous tags are the clean tags that remained after the removal of tags mapped to reference sequences from multiple genes



the distribution of the total clean tags and the distinct clean tags in each tag-abundance category was similar among the four dge libraries . sequencing saturation analysis of the four libraries revealed that the number of detected genes plateaued shortly after 1 m tags were sequenced, and no new genes were identified when the total sequence number approached 2 m, indicating that the approximately 4 m tags in each library represented complete coverage of the transcriptome .fig.  <dig> distribution of the total clean tags and distinct clean tags in urechis unicinctus exposed to 50 μm sulfide for different periods

to elucidate the molecular events underlying the dge profiles, the clean tags were mapped to the previous transcriptome. in the control, 6-h, 24-h and 48-h libraries,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the distinct clean tags uniquely mapped to the reference sequence, generating  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tag-mapped genes, respectively .

deg  identification, validation and pathway enrich analysis
compared to the control library,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tag-mapped genes were identified as degs  ≤  <dig>  and fold-change cut-off of  <dig> fold) in the 6-h, 24-h and 48-h libraries, respectively . in the 6-h library,  <dig> genes  were up-regulated, and  <dig>  were down-regulated. a majority of the dges in the 24-h and 48-h libraries were down-regulated  of the 24-h library degs and  <dig>  of the 48-h library degs) .fig.  <dig> deg transcriptome profiles of urechis unicinctus exposed to 50 μm sulfide for different periods. the values in the red and green regions represent the number of up-regulated and down-regulated degs, respectively



to validate the digital gene expression  results,  <dig> candidate unigenes representing different biological processes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis. the results of qrt-pcr were regressed against the dge analysis, with a correlation coefficient  and p-value reported for each of the  <dig> unigenes investigated . of the selected unigenes, eight returned a correlation coefficient with a p-value <  <dig>  or < <dig> , showing the consistence between dge and qrt-pcr. the left  <dig> unigenes did not show a significant correlation. however, all the candidate unigenes demonstrated a concordant trend of change for both dge and qrt-pcr results, indicating that our results were reliable.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr verification of the digital gene expression profiles of selected degs. a dge; b qrt-pcr results versus dge results. for each qrt-pcr validation, five technical replications were performed. the correlation coefficient  of the regression between qrt-pcr and dge for each of the  <dig> unigenes investigated was analyzed and shown. *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig> 



kegg pathway analysis of the degs revealed that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> metabolic pathways were affected in u. unicinctus exposed to 50 μm sulfide for  <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h, respectively and the pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, proteasome, complement and coagulation cascades, and metabolism were all significantly enriched in the 6-h, 24-h and 48-h library .

discussion
u. unicinctus, belonging to the phylum echiura, can tolerate high concentrations of sulfide living in the “u-shaped” burrows in intertidal and subtidal mudflats. in this study, we first demonstrated a de novo assembly of the u. unicinctus transcriptome using illumina hiseq <dig> platform. this is also the first transcriptome report in echiuran worms. in the obtained transcriptome of u. unicinctus, the assembly of the  <dig> , <dig> clean reads produced  <dig>  unique sequences with an average size of 738 bp which is comparable with other studies generating transcriptome data . the number of protein-coding genes in the u. unicinctus genome is unknown; however, if we assume general conservation based on estimates for the representative of the phylum annelida capitella teleta , ~83 % of protein-coding genes  were assembled in this study. all the transcriptome data obtained in u. unicinctus indicated that it is appropriate to conduct dge analysis to identify transcriptional response to sulfide in u. unicinctus.

in the dge analysis, a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tag-mapped degs were identified, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> metabolic pathways were affected when the worms were exposed to 50 μm sulfide for  <dig>   <dig> or 48 h, respectively. these degs displayed many biological functions, suggesting molecular mechanisms involved in the sulfide response. in mammals, several pathways—such as mapk, nf-κb and apoptosis—are affected by sulfide and might be important for the sulfide tolerance ; we also identified some degs in these pathways such as ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase  <dig> alpha  and phospholipase a <dig>  in the mapk pathway, toll-like receptor  <dig>  and myeloid differentiation primary response protein  <dig>  in the nf-κb pathway and caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> in the apoptosis pathway , which are consistent with the previous results. furthermore, in fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, it is revealed by microarray analysis that a large number of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were down regulated after sulfide treatment, such as nadh dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase , glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase complex subunit  <dig>  and cytochrome c oxidase subunit via , indicating that sulfide could affect the expressions of many mitochondrial proteins at transcriptional level  <cit> . in our dge results, the mrna expression levels of genes encoding mitochondrial complex i  and complex ii  were down-regulated , which was similar with the results of  <cit> . meanwhile the expression of genes such as sqr, sdo and st encoding mitochondrial sulfide oxidation enzymes increased with the sulfide exposure time , which agreed with our previous studies  <cit> . these results demonstrate that our databases are reliable.table  <dig> degs and their associated pathways in u. unicinctus exposed to sulfide



in this study, several unique pathways and more than 80 % of the identified pathway members are the first report, which are associated with sulfide stress in u. unicinctus exposed to sulfide. among these pathways, atp generated pathways  as well as the pidd  induced pathways involving in the dna damage response attracted our interests.

usually the anaerobic glycolytic pathway typically replaces oxidative phosphorylation for atp production and the maintenance of the intracellular atp balance when mouse or human cells are cultured in media containing 10 μm sulfide, and the expression of nearly all of the genes in the anaerobic glycolytic pathway are up-regulated  <cit> . in u. unicinctus, it is confirmed that activities of key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase become markedly high after fertilization in u. unicinctus eggs  <cit> , and enzymes associated with oxidative phosphorylation for atp production have also been elucidated in echiuran respiration . in this study, we identified a large number of genes related to glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, such as pyruvate kinase, phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, adp-dependent glucokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase . interestingly, the expressions of most unigenes involved in glycolysis such as adp-dependent glucokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase were significantly down-regulated when the worms were exposed to sulfide ; moreover, the mrna levels of both complex i and complex ii were also down-regulated . these results suggested unlike mammals, u. unicinctus may adopt a non-glycolytic pathway to produce atp when sulfide exposure. several sulfide-tolerant organisms—such as the ribbed mussel geukensia demissa, echiuran worm u. unicinctus and the lugworm arenicola marina—utilize sulfide to produce atp . hildebrandt  <cit>  suggested that a super-complex composed of sqr and complexes iii and iv initiates atp production using sulfide as a material resource when sulfide enters the respiratory chain of rat mitochondria. in this study, the genes encoding sqr and complexes iii and iv  were all up-regulated in u. unicinctus exposed to sulfide. therefore, we propose that the super-complex  catalytic activity by using sulfide as a material resource replaces the glycolysis to maintain the atp balance when these worms are exposed to sulfide. further studies are needed to confirm these suggestions.

it is known sulfide generates significant oxidative damage to genomic dna  <cit> . typically, pidd, a key member of the p <dig> dna damage response pathway, activates two distinct pathways in response to dna damage. one is to activate nf-κb via the ubiquitination of nemo to stimulate dna repair and promote organismal survival ; alternatively, pidd induces genotoxic stress-mediated apoptosis and activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway to protect genome integrity  <cit> . in this study, all the members involving in this pathway were all in up-regulated expression when u. unicinctus were exposed to sulfide . furthermore, it is suggested that pidd acts in response to sulfide-induced dna damage based on probably the increase of the pidd mrna level. further researches need to be conducted to verify the suggestions from the dge analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a transcriptome from the u. unicinctus adult tissues was sequenced. this database is currently the largest in echiuran worms, and  <dig>  unigenes are assembled. many unigenes have been identified and are involved in various fields. then based on the transcriptome, transcriptional profile of u. unicinctus exposed to 50 μm was revealed via dge analysis. approximately  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h after sulfide exposure, respectively. these degs are involved in many biological processes. in the dge database of u. unicinctus, the alterations in certain known sulfide-related pathways indicate similar changes in response to sulfide, whereas u. unicinctus exhibited differences from other species with respect to its modulation of glycolysis in response to sulfide. in addition, this is the first report on pidd in response to sulfide-induced dna damage in u. unicinctus. these data facilitates the identification of sulfide-related genes and elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which organisms tolerate sulfide stress. this study provides a framework for additional functional studies to examine sulfide toxicology in this system.
