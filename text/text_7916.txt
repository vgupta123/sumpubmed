BACKGROUND
aspergillus niger is a versatile filamentous fungus found in the environment all over the world in soil and on decaying plant material and it has been reported to grow on a large number of foods and feeds  <cit> . at the same time it is a popular production host for industrial fermentations and it is used for production of both organic acids and for indigenous and heterologous enzymes and proteins  <cit> . however, a. niger produces various secondary metabolites, and among those also the important mycotoxins fumonisin b <dig>  and ochratoxin a   <cit> . due to the ubiquity of a. niger, its production of secondary metabolites is important both from a biotechnological and a food-safety viewpoint.

secondary metabolites are small molecules that are not directly involved in metabolism and growth. both plants and fungi are known for producing a large number of chemically diverse secondary metabolites. while the role of some of these metabolites makes sense biologically as inferring an advantage to the producer, e.g. antibiotics, virulence factors, siderophores and pigments, the benefit of others is less obvious or unknown. the general belief is that the secondary metabolites must contribute to the survival of the producer in its environment where it competes with other organisms  <cit> . whereas the ability to produce individual secondary metabolites is species-specific, the actual production of secondary metabolites has, in broad terms, been reported to be affected by the developmental stage of the fungus  and intrinsic and extrinsic factors of the environment as substrate , temperature, light and oxygen availability  <cit> .

fumonisins are a group of secondary metabolites with a highly reduced polyketide-derived structure consisting of a hydrocarbon backbone with an amino group in one end, some methyl groups and two ester-bound side groups consisting of tricarballylic acid moieties. the fumonisin b-series group contains up to three hydroxyl groups and the degree of hydroxylation gives rise to the designations b1-b <dig> <cit> . these are classified as mycotoxins as they have been shown to be cytotoxic and carcinogenic  <cit>  and fumonisins have been suspected to be involved in oesophageal cancer in south africa and china  <cit> . fumonisin production in fusarium spp. has been known since the 1980's  <cit> , while the ability of a. niger to produce fb <dig> was just discovered in  <dig> based on indications from the genome sequencing projects of a. niger atcc  <dig> and cbs  <dig>   <cit> . the fumonisin biosynthesis pathway and the gene cluster are partly characterized in f. verticillioides and include a polyketide synthase , fatty acyl-coa synthetases , an aminotransferase , a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase , cytochome p <dig> monooxygenases  and a dioxygenase   <cit> . the expected fumonisin biosynthesis gene cluster in the a. niger cbs  <dig>  genome contains  <dig> open reading frames of which a number has similarity to the fumonisin biosynthesis cluster genes in f. verticillioides  <cit> . although the knowledge of the biosynthesis pathway is incomplete, the expected precursors and cofactors required for production of fumonisins are acetyl-coa, malonyl-coa, methionine, alanine, 2-ketoglutarate, o <dig> and nadph  <cit> .

due to the late discovery of fb <dig> production in a. niger, its ability to produce this metabolite has only been the subject of a few studies. a. niger was shown to be a relatively consistent producer of fb <dig> on media such as czapek yeast autolysate agar  with 5% nacl  <cit> , yet it was noted that the media that support fb <dig> production in a. niger were different from those who were supportive in f. verticillioides  <cit> .

to evaluate the potential risk of mycotoxin production in foods and feeds, we explored the influence of substrate on fb <dig> production by a. niger. during our screening of food-related carbon sources as glucose, sucrose, lactate, starch and fat we found that lactate, when added to a medium containing starch, could synergistically increase the fb <dig> production compared to either starch or lactate alone. to reveal a biological explanation for this interesting observation, we combined growth physiology studies including measurement of several secondary metabolites with a proteome study.

proteome studies give information about the capability for metabolic flow in the cell, for maintenance of the cell and for anabolic and catabolic processes. the proteome constitutes the cellular machinery, is energetically expensive to maintain and has a crucial influence on the fitness of the fungus. protein synthesis and degradation are thus carefully regulated at multiple levels. the use of proteome analysis within studies of filamentous fungi has attracted increasing interest in these years and has recently been reviewed by carberry and doyle  <cit> , kim et al.  <cit>  and andersen and nielsen  <cit> . the emergence of fungal genome sequences combined with continuously improved mass spectrometry technologies will further show proteomics as useful for studies in fungal biology.

we report on a 2d gel based proteome study conducted to relate differences in protein levels with differences in secondary metabolites especially fb <dig> production, and with the aim of elaborating on the reasons for an increased fb <dig> production on medium containing starch in combination with lactate.

RESULTS
growth and secondary metabolite production
for these experiments we used a wildtype a. niger isolate  that is able to carry out normal metabolism and synthesis essential for growth and survival in a natural habitat. additionally it was able to produce both of the two mycotoxins fb <dig> and ota. with the aim to explore factors that influence secondary metabolism, especially fb <dig> biosynthesis, we used this isolate, grown on the surface of a solid medium and with a moderately rich substrate containing amino acids, nitrate, vitamins, minerals, trace metals and the polysaccharide starch . a. niger ibt  <dig> grew vigorously under these conditions . mycelium was observed  <dig> hours after inoculation and biomass accumulated within  <dig> hours. aerial hyphae, the first sign of onset of conidiation, were observed already after  <dig> hours.

to measure the production of secondary metabolites we used a modified version of a micro-scale extraction procedure  <cit>  that is suitable for detection of a wide array of metabolites. using plug sampling, the amount of secondary metabolites was determined per surface area of the culture including both metabolites within the cells and metabolites diffusing into the medium. using this method we detected the following metabolites produced by a. niger on starch-containing medium; fumonisin b <dig>  fumonisin b <dig>  ochratoxin a, ochratoxin alpha, malformin a, malformin c, orlandin, desmethylkotanin, kotanin, aurasperone b, pyranonigrin a and tensidol b.

presence of lactate, which may be encountered in environments with fermenting microorganisms and especially in fermented food products, was found to increase fb <dig> production considerably when supplied in tandem with starch. the fb <dig> levels detected on media with 3% starch plus 3% lactate were 2- <dig> times higher than the levels on 3% starch. the differences were significant  at the samplings  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after inoculation . the stimulating effect of lactate on fb <dig> production seemed to be proportional to the concentration of lactate as 3% starch plus  <dig> % lactate resulted in levels intermediate of those containing 3% starch and either no lactate or 3% lactate. fumonisin b <dig>  orlandin, desmethylkotanin and pyranonigrin a were regulated like fb <dig> but only during the later growth phase . especially the level of the polyketide orlandin was increased synergistically by the combination of starch and lactate. orlandin, desmethylkotanin and kotanin have very similar polyketide structures and are expected to be part of the same biosynthesis pathway  <cit> , but kotanin was not influenced in the same way as orlandin and desmethylkotanin by presence of starch and lactate. the differential influence of starch and lactate on production of the  <dig> measured metabolites indicates that secondary metabolism of a. niger is not restricted to a common regulation under these conditions. presence of starch was important for both the growth and the production of secondary metabolites; all were lower on 3% lactate compared to 3% starch with the exception of the ochratoxins that were produced at similar amounts on lactate and starch.

we considered whether the effect of lactate in combination with starch could be due to a specific induction of secondary metabolite synthesis by lactate and if this could constitute some kind of antimicrobial defence. however we found that pyruvate, a product of l-lactate degradation , had a similar effect , which makes an effect of lactate itself unlikely and to a higher degree pointing to an effect of lactate degradation.

while it is well known that starch is degraded by extracellular enzymes to maltose and glucose, transported into the cell and then entering glycolysis, we may assume that lactate is transported into the cell by a lactate transporter and mainly metabolized further to pyruvate by a l-lactate dehydrogenase  or a l-lactate dehydrogenase  , both are predicted to be present in the genome. while the medium with 3% starch + 3% lactate contains approximately the double amount of added carbon source  compared to the media with 3% starch or 3% lactate alone, it is possible that this is partly counteracted by carbon catabolite repression of the lactate transporter, as the activity of the lactate transporter in yeast, jen1p, is inversely related to the concentration of repressing sugar  <cit> . the available energy contributed from 3% lactate is expected to be a bit lower than from 3% starch, as less atp is generated from  <dig> lactate  than from  <dig> glucose . but, this is based on the assumption that a full conversion of starch to glucose occurs and that glucose is not turned into energy storage metabolites as trehalose or polyols, as it does during liquid culture conditions  <cit> .   

in practice, we observed a low biomass production  on the medium with 3% lactate, while the produced biomass on media containing 3% starch with or without additional 3% lactate was not significantly different. although the presence of starch was important for both growth and fb <dig> production of a. niger, addition of either 3% maltose or 3% xylose to medium containing 3% starch did not further increase the fb <dig> production. the effect of added lactate can consequently not be a simple result of a double amount of carbon source.

exploring the proteome
proteome analysis was conducted in order to identify proteins for which expression levels were altered during growth of a. niger on media containing 3% starch , 3% starch + 3% lactate  and 3% lactate , and if possible relate the identified proteins to the influence on fb <dig> production. the samples for protein extraction were taken  <dig> hours after inoculation as the fb <dig> production rate was estimated to be highest at this time. in order to document fb <dig> synthesis, fb <dig> production was measured after  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours. the fb <dig> synthesis rate was calculated to be   <dig> ±  <dig> ng/cm2/h on s,  <dig> ±  <dig> ng/cm2/h on sl and  <dig> ±  <dig> ng/cm2/h on l. biomass  was measured after  <dig> hours and was   <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/cm <dig> on s,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/cm <dig> on sl and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/cm <dig> on l.

extracted proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . on  <dig> gels, representing  <dig> biological replicates and  <dig> technical replicates of a. niger cultures on each of the media s, sl and l, we detected 536- <dig> spots. with regard to the size of gels and amount of loaded protein, this was comparable to detected spots in other proteome studies of intracellular proteins in aspergillus  <cit> . one protein was present at very high levels on the media containing starch, which was identified as glucoamylase . jorgensen et al.  <cit>  did similarly find this protein to have the highest transcript level of all genes in a transcriptome analysis of a. niger on maltose. because of the volume and diffusion of this spot, the area containing this spot was excluded from the data analysis. about 80% of the spots were matched to spots on a reference gel containing a mixture of all samples. thus, the total dataset for further analysis consisted of  <dig> matched spots .

large differences in the proteome of a. niger when grown on s, sl and l were evident. a principal component analysis  clearly separated the gels with proteins from each media into three separate groups . the largest variance in relative spot volume was between samples from media with or without presence of starch , while the next-largest variance in relative spot volume separated samples from s and sl . statistically, 36% of the spots were present at significantly different levels between two or all three of the treatments . clustering of the  <dig> spots according to their relative spot volume by consensus clustering  <cit>  resulted in prediction of  <dig> clusters. more than half of the spots were in clusters with a clear influence of medium on the protein level  and  <dig> spots were in clusters with protein levels affected specifically on sl   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  38).

1) the graphs show the protein level profiles for selected clusters shown as transformed values between - <dig> and  <dig>  where  <dig> indicates the average protein level. the bars give the standard deviations within the clusters.

2) one spot, identified as glucoamylase , was excluded from the data analysis . thus the total number of identified spots was  <dig> 

the spots to be identified were selected within clusters with a profile with either distinct or tendency for higher  or lower  protein levels on sl compared to on s and l as these correlated positively or negatively with fb <dig> production. also some spots with levels influenced by presence of starch  or lactate  with either distinct or highly abundant presence on the gels were selected. spots present at significant different levels between the two or three treatments were preferred. a total of  <dig> spots were identified using in-gel trypsin digestion to peptides, maldi tof/tof and mascot searches of retrieved ms/ms spectra to sequences from the databases swiss-prot  <cit>  or ncbinr  <cit> . we did not use any taxonomic restrictions, however all except one protein were confidently identified as a. niger  proteins. one protein  that did not match an a. niger protein, probably because it was missed or truncated during sequencing, had a significant match to a protein from n. crassa . only  <dig> proteins  were identified as proteins in the swiss-prot database and thus regarded as fully characterised. otherwise, the proteins were registered in the ncbinr database as it contains the protein entries predicted from the sequencing of the a. niger cbs  <dig>  genome  <cit> . per primo march  <dig> the predicted proteome based on this sequencing project contained  <dig> predicted proteins of which  <dig> % had automatically assigned go annotations and only  <dig> proteins had been assigned as manually reviewed in the uniprotkb database  <cit> . to circumvent the limited number of annotated proteins, we assigned annotations based on sequence similarity to characterised swiss-prot proteins in other species using blastp  <cit> . a protein annotation was assigned to a protein if it had more than 80% sequence identity to a characterised swiss-prot protein and a "putative" annotation to proteins that had 50-80% sequence identity to a characterised protein. other proteins were assigned a "predicted" function if interpro domains were predicted using interproscan  <cit> . in this way, the identified proteins consisted of  <dig>  fully characterised,  <dig> with annotation based on sequence similarity,  <dig> with putative annotation,  <dig> with predicted function and  <dig>  uncharacterised proteins. the proteins with known functions were mainly involved in processes as: polysaccharide degradation; carbon-, nitrogen- and amino acid metabolism; energy production; protein synthesis, folding and degradation; redox balance and protection against oxidative stress. none of the characterised proteins were known to participate in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. a fatty acid synthase subunit alpha  was identified, which was present at higher levels on sl compared to on s and l . this protein may contribute to fatty acid biosynthesis to be incorporated in the cell membrane; however it may also be an unrecognised polyketide synthase. one gene coding for a predicted aldo/keto reductase  was located adjacent to the predicted fb <dig> biosynthesis cluster in the a. niger genome. but this protein was present at higher levels on starch-containing media  and therefore did not correlate with fb <dig> production. furthermore, proteins involved in secondary metabolite synthesis or processes associated with transport or self-protection are not necessarily located within the clusters. one example is a reductase found to participate in aflatoxin biosynthesis in a. parasiticus, although it is not located within the aflatoxin cluster and was regulated differently than the aflatoxin cluster genes  <cit> .

a throughout tendency was that many of the proteins influenced by the combination of starch and lactate in the medium were likely to affect either the acetyl-coa level or the nadph level as discussed below.

regulation of central metabolic enzymes
the identified proteins appeared to include several important enzymes in the primary metabolism . glucose 6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase  and a putative 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , the first  and third enzyme in the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway  were present at higher levels on sl . they both reduce nadp to nadph, and these enzymes are believed to be the main source of nadph regeneration in the cell  <cit> . additionally three enzymes in the non-oxidative part of the ppp were identified. a putative transketolase  and a putative transaldolase  had tendencies for higher levels on sl . a predicted ribose/galactose isomerase , presumably with ribose 5-phosphate isomerase activity, was present at lower levels on sl . lower level of this enzyme, responsible for synthesis of ribose 5-phosphate required for the biosynthesis of some amino acids, nucleotides, and coenzymes, indicates that the ppp was optimised to nadph regeneration rather than to nucleotide synthesis on sl. one glycolysis enzyme, fructose-biphosphate aldolase , had tendency for lower level on sl , which is in good agreement with a higher activity of the ppp. those enzymes identified downstream of pyruvate, the entry point of lactate into metabolism, were either clearly present at higher levels on sl or had the tendency for higher level. this included a putative pyruvate dehydrogenase    and the three enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid  cycle converting citrate to isocitrate, the irreversible step from isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate, and from 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-coa. the first and the third tca cycle enzyme, a putative aconitate hydratase  and a putative 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase , was clearly present at higher levels on sl , while nadp-dependant isocitrate dehydrogenase  had a tendency for higher level but with a noisy profile . one enzyme that occurred at higher level when lactate was present in the media  was a putative acetyl-coa hydrolase . this enzyme has been designated to catalyse the hydrolysis of acetyl-coa to acetate, but may rather posses coa transferase activity between succinyl-, propionyl- and acetyl-coa and the corresponding acids  <cit> . in yeast, acetyl-coa hydrolase is involved in trafficking of acetyl-coa across membranes in the form of acetate and thus is expected to be important for regulation of the acetyl-coa level  <cit> .

to summarize, higher levels of the enzymes in the ppp that generate nadph during growth on sl compared to on s and l indicate an increased ability to regenerate nadph when the nadp:nadph ratio is increased. the higher levels of the enzymes in the metabolism of pyruvate after pyruvate enters mitochondria on sl and the higher levels of putative acetyl-coa hydrolase in presence of lactate indicate an increased amount of carbon passing through acetyl-coa during growth on sl.

regulation of enzymes influencing the nadph level
a remarkable requirement for nadph on sl medium is pointed out by the simultaneous effect on several of the relatively few enzymes that contribute to nadph regeneration. we found glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, putative 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and putative ketol-acid reductoisomerase , an enzyme in isoleucine, leucine and valine biosynthesis, to be present at higher levels on sl. regulation of these enzymes is probably due to an increased nadp:nadph ratio. the activity of the first enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, is known to be regulated by nadp:nadph levels  <cit> . larochelle et al.  <cit>  showed in yeast that transcription of the corresponding gene was also affected by the nadph level and they attributed this to a transcription factor stb <dig>  the yeast cell regulates the metabolism to counteract a high nadp:nadph ratio by up-regulating the ppp and down-regulating glycolysis  <cit> , which neatly corresponds to the changes we have observed in these pathways.

a. niger needs a supply of nadph for several anabolic and biosynthetic processes as well as for protection against oxidative stress. a supply of nadph is for example required in order to utilize nitrate as nitrogen source, since the enzyme that converts nitrate to nitrite, nitrate reductase, uses nadph as cofactor  <cit> .

on sl, we observed higher levels of enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, ammonium assimilation and protection against oxidative stress, those activities may increase the nadp:nadph ratio  <cit> . as mentioned previously, we observed a higher level of a fatty acid synthase subunit alpha on sl  that requires nadph in order to catalyse the biosynthesis of fatty acids. we also identified nadp-dependant glutamate dehydrogenase  involved in ammonium assimilation and thioredoxin reductase  that utilises nadph to reduce thioredoxin during conditions with oxidative stress; both had tendencies for higher levels on sl . furthermore, the polyketide synthase involved in fb <dig> biosynthesis uses nadph as cofactor  <cit>  and that may also affect the nadp:nadph ratio.

these results show a clear tendency towards increased nadph turnover and regeneration during growth on sl.

relation between regulated proteins and fb <dig> biosynthesis
the identified proteins regulated on sl were mainly enzymes in the primary metabolism and other processes that likely affect the intracellular levels of acetyl-coa or nadph. the higher fb <dig> production on sl is thus most likely a result of changes in the metabolism due to lactate degradation. acetyl-coa is a precursor for production of fb <dig> as well as for other polyketide-derived metabolites  <cit> . high level of acetyl-coa during growth on sl may thus be what drives the high fb <dig> production. this is supported by the observation that pyruvate had a similar effect as lactate on fb <dig> production. a good ability to regenerate nadph when the nadp:nadph ratio is increased may be an important prerequisite for the high fb <dig> production on sl.

however, the effect of added lactate to a medium containing starch on fb <dig> production was dramatic and not expected to be solely precursor-driven. further, the  <dig> secondary metabolites measured in this study, which include polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides and polyketide-derived alkaloids, were affected differently by the presence of starch and lactate and a pattern reflecting the biosynthetic origin of the metabolites was not evident. this supports that the influence of lactate in combination with starch on fb <dig> production is regulatory rather than an effect solely driven by abundance of precursors. we hypothesise that the fb <dig> production, when induced, could be regulated globally according to the nutrient/energy state. as a central compound in metabolism, carefully regulated and compartmentalised, acetyl-coa may be a candidate for this  <cit> . acetyl-coa has been shown to be able to affect transcription in vitro  <cit> . in yeast, it has been suggested that transcription of the inositol 1-phosphate synthase gene, ino <dig>  is influenced by the acetyl-coa level during conditions with high levels of energy-rich metabolites  <cit> . in accordance, we identified a putative inositol-1-phosphate synthase  among the proteins with higher levels on sl medium . inositol-1-phosphate synthase is the first and rate-controlling enzyme in the inositol biosynthesis pathway and converts glucose 6-phosphate into inositol 1-phosphate. inositol is incorporated into phosphatidylinositol that in turn is a precursor of sphingolipids and inositol polyphosphates, required for a diverse set of processes that include glycolipid anchoring of proteins, signal transduction , mrnaexport and vesicle trafficking  <cit> . acetyl-coa is also a substrate for protein acetylation by protein acetylases, and acetylation can influence both gene expression and protein activity  <cit> . in a. parasiticus there has been observed a correlation between initiation and spread of histone acetylation in the aflatoxin gene promoters and the initiation of aflatoxin gene expression  <cit> . another study of a. nidulans has shown that genetic deletion of a histone deacetylase caused elevated gene expression and enhanced production of sterigmatocystin and penicillin  <cit> . the same study demonstrated that treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors could enhance production of some secondary metabolites by penicillium expansum and alternaria alternata, indicating that histone acetylation and deacetylation have a role in regulation of secondary metabolite production in a broad range of fungal genera.

secondary metabolite synthesis can be subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms. regulation of fumonisin b <dig> biosynthesis in f. verticillioides has been found to be complex with several positive and negative regulators and influenced by nitrogen, carbon and ph  <cit> . corresponding to our results, fumonisin b <dig> production in f. verticillioides has been shown to be induced by the presence of starch  <cit> . however, f. verticillioides and a. niger are widely different physiologically and genetically, thus production and regulation of fumonisin biosynthesis are not expected to be identical  <cit> .

during conditions where a. niger spends resources on producing extracellular enzymes for degradation of plant tissue and starch, protection against other microorganisms competing for nutrients would be beneficial. fumonisin b <dig> has been shown to have antifungal activity against species as alternaria alternata, penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and fusarium graminearum  <cit> , thus fb <dig> could be expected to have a similar effect. increased production of fb <dig> during conditions with high acetyl-coa level may thus have evolved because antifungal activity was advantageous to a. niger as a way to protect the nutrient sources in the environment.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that lactate, when supplemented in a rich substrate containing nitrate and starch, can increase the fb <dig> production in a. niger. based on the identified proteins within the central metabolism, we suggest this to be due to changes in the balance of intracellular metabolites towards a higher level of carbon passing through acetyl-coa and a high capacity to regenerate nadph. given that the fb <dig> biosynthesis genes are induced, the results indicate that the availability of precursors and nadph has a large influence on production of fb <dig>  the production of certain other secondary metabolites was affected in a similar fashion as fb <dig> by lactate , while other secondary metabolites were not . consequently, as these metabolites were affected differently by the presence of starch and lactate, they must be regulated differently in a. niger.

we find it likely that the influence of starch and lactate/pyruvate on fb <dig> production is part of a global regulation inferred by the nutrient/energy state and propose that this could be through the action of acetyl-coa. whether, if and how, acetyl-coa affects gene transcription or activity of enzymes in the fb <dig> biosynthesis pathway could be the scope of relevant, future studies.

it remains to be seen whether production of secondary metabolites in other species of filamentous fungi is increased by presence of starch and lactate. the effect of starch and lactate in combination may be relevant to be aware of for starch-containing foods and feeds where fungi occur concurrently with lactic acid fermentation, which could be the case in low-fat mould-fermented sausages, in fermented vegetable products and in silage. technologically, the obtained knowledge of substrate influence on production of specific secondary metabolites could be beneficial, as lactate or other carbon sources could be used to increase metabolite production during industrial fermentation.
