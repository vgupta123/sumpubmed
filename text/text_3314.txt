BACKGROUND
the post-translational modification by ubiquitin  plays an essential role for numerous cellular functions such as protein degradation, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, immune response, apoptosis, oncogenesis, pre-implantation, and intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> . conjugation of ubiquitin to a target protein is achieved by the sequential enzymatic actions via ubiquitin-activating enzymes , ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes , and ubiquitin ligases . a novel ubiquitination factor  required for efficient multiubiquitination has been identified in yeast  <cit> . proteins modified with a polyubiquitin chain are then unfolded and degraded by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . deubiquitination, a removal of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated protein substrates, is mediated by a number of deubiquitinating enzymes. most deubiquitinating  enzymes are cysteine proteases and consist of at least five families, the ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases , the ubiquitin specific processing proteases , jab1/pab1/mpn-domain-containing metallo-enzymes , otu-domain ubiquitin aldehyde-binding proteins , and ataxin-3/josephin  <cit> . the usp family members vary in size and structural complexity, but all contain  <dig> characteristic conserved homology domains  <cit> . the uch family members are relatively small molecules, which hydrolyze c-terminal amides and esters of ubiquitin  <cit> . the jamm isopeptidases are known to deneddylate cullin  and to release ubiquitin chains from proteins targeted for degradation   <cit> . the members of otu family have been reported as highly specific ub isopeptidases, but they have no sequence homology to known dubs  <cit> . lastly, ataxin- <dig> has a domain called the josephin domain, cleaves ubiquitin-amc, and binds to the dub inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde  <cit> .

hyaluronan is a kind of glycosaminoglycan, which is involved in the regulation of cell division  <cit> , angiogenesis  <cit> , and cell motility  <cit> . hyaluronan exists in extracellular and pericellular matrices and interacts with various kinds of proteins  <cit> . recent reports showed the existence of a few intracellular hyaluronan binding proteins  and one of them, receptor form hyaluronan-mediated motility  binds intracellular hyaluronan and plays multiple roles including cell cycle arrest  <cit>  and spindle pole stability  <cit> .

usp <dig> subfamily members have been previously identified  <cit>  and one of them, dub- <dig>  has shown that the constitutive expression of dub- <dig> blocks proliferation and can lead to apoptosis  <cit> . in this study, we have identified four novel members of usp <dig> subfamily which encode a deubiquitinating enzyme, from human chorionic villi tissues. our study demonstrates for the first time that usp <dig> subfamily members of the dub enzyme regulate apoptosis and cell death of cancerous cells and contain putative hyaluronan and rna binding domains.

RESULTS
cloning of usp <dig> subfamily members in human chorionic villi and embryonic carcinoma cell lines
to identify putative deubiquitinating enzymes that contain a conserved asp  domain in humans, the genbank database was accessed and searched using the blast algorithm at the ncbi, as described previously  <cit> . in this study, we obtained multiple cdnas including dub- <dig>  <cit>  and usp <dig>  <cit>  from human chorionic villi tissues and various cancer cell lines by rt-pcr. we performed rt-pcr, sequenced pcr products three times independently in order to exclude the possibility of pcr errors, and classified the genes as usp <dig> subfamily members  due to the high homology to known sequences  <cit> . to characterize the genetic properties of human usp <dig> genes, the complete nucleotide sequences of usp17k, usp17l, usp17m, and usp17n  were analyzed. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the seqed v <dig> . <dig> program and clustal method of the megalign program, a multiple alignment program of the dnastar package. the full-length cdnas for usp17k, usp17l and usp17m consist of  <dig> nucleotides in open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig> kda . the full-length cdna for usp17n consists of  <dig> nucleotides in open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence of  <dig> amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda . the conserved cys, his and asp domains, which are thought to form the active site of the deubiquitinating enzymes, are also found in the usp17k, usp17l, usp17m and usp17n ; these conserved domains have been previously shown in other deubiquitinating enzymes including usp <dig>  <cit> , dub- <dig>  <cit> , and dub- <dig>  <cit> . sequence analysis for amino acids of novel usp <dig> subfamily members indicates that usp17k, usp17l and usp17m have high degree of homology , and usp17n is identical with usp17c when compared with each other and usp <dig> family members . phylogenetic analysis for nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of novel genes revealed that all novel genes were grouped into the usp <dig> subfamily  and they were characterized in this report.

examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of these enzymes by pfam  <cit>  revealed that novel subfamily members of usp <dig> contain the putative conserved hyaluronan binding motifs  -x7-  <cit> . these putative motifs are located between amino acid residues arg  <dig> to lys  <dig>  and lys  <dig> to lys  <dig> . in addition, "rgg" amino acid sequences predicted for the novel rna binding motif are found at the c-terminus. interestingly, usp17n lacks of these binding motifs , suggesting the unique functional roles for these motifs. even though it has been suggested that human usp <dig> subfamily members are homologous to murine dub subfamily members due to the fact that they are cytokine-inducible and regulate cell growth and survival  <cit> , hyaluronan and rna binding motifs are not found in members of murine dub subfamily .

expression of transcripts for novel usp <dig> subfamily members in human tissues and cancerous cells
to investigate the expression pattern of transcripts for novel usp <dig> subfamily members in human tissues and cancerous cells, northern blot and rt-pcr analyses were performed. as shown in figure 4a, northern blot analysis revealed that transcripts for novel usp <dig> subfamily members were expressed in the heart, liver, and pancreas at a high level. interestingly, we obtained multiple bands having different sizes  using a 5'  <dig> bp probe of usp17l . we also detected  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb major bands of usp <dig> subfamily members using a probe designed for a 3'  <dig> kb probe of usp17l  . it is possible that other minor mrna transcripts around  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb, which have not been detected with dub- <dig> probe  <cit> , may be derived from alternative splicing, promoter usage, or poly  usage. the presence of a few different sizes of transcript indicates that novel genes belong to the usp <dig> subfamily and that there are at least several members of this family present. in addition to various human tissues, rt-pcr analysis showed that the expression of transcripts for novel usp <dig> subfamily members was detected in various human cancer cell lines including hela, hec-1a, nccit, and fibrosarcoma cells .

novel usp <dig> subfamily members as a deubiquitinating enzyme
to determine whether novel usp <dig> subfamily proteins have ubiquitin specific protease enzymatic activity, deubiquitinating enzyme assays were performed. for in vitro enzyme assay, novel usp <dig> subfamily members were expressed as a gst fusion protein. as shown by immunoblotting analysis , four gst fusion proteins demonstrated a strong efficient cleavage of ub-met-β-gal . we generated the cys conserved domain mutant for each of novel usp <dig> subfamily proteins  using a site-directed mutagenesis method. as expected, cells with the empty vector alone  and mutants  failed to cleave ub-met-β-gal.

for in vivo deubiquitinating enzyme assay, ha-tagged pmt123-ubiquitin was transiently expressed in human endometrial carcinoma cells  with or without pcdna3-myc-usp17l and pcdna3-myc-usp17l . then, we analyzed deubiquitinating enzyme activity by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-ha antibody. the expression bands of polyubiquitinated proteins were nearly invisible in cells expressing pcdna3-myc-usp17l , but not in cells expressing pcdna3-myc-usp17l  . the molecular weight for a mutant form of usp17l  is bigger than wild type usp17l, suggesting that there may be a conformational change due to the amino acid substitution. in addition, other usp <dig> subfamily members showed the deubiquitinating enzyme activity in vivo . taken together, we concluded that novel usp <dig> subfamily proteins have deubiquitinating enzyme activity.

hyaluronan/rna-binding properties of usp <dig> subfamily proteins
since it is not known whether hyaluronan-binding sites within usp <dig> subfamily proteins are indeed functional, we further examined whether usp <dig> subfamily proteins actually binds hyaluronan. the cetylpyridinium chloride -precipitation assay has been used for investigating binding affinity  <cit>  and the assay in our study demonstrated that usp <dig> subfamily proteins interact with hyaluronan based on the comparison of binding intensity between endogenous and exogenous hyaluronans . however, usp17n did not interact with hyaluronan , indicating that the c-terminal domain of usp <dig> subfamily proteins is required for binding with hyaluronan.

since it has been reported that the habp4_pai-rbp <dig> domain, which is involved in mrna stability  <cit> , interacts with both hyaluronan and rna  <cit> , we additionally investigated the activity of usp <dig> subfamily proteins for binding with rna. we performed the cpc-precipitation assay and found that usp <dig> subfamily proteins also bind to rna in a dose-dependent manner . interestingly, usp17n did not interact with rna as shown with hyaluronan , indicating that the c-terminal domain of usp <dig> subfamily proteins is also required for binding with rna.

localization study of usp17l
in order to investigate the intracellular localization of usp <dig> subfamily proteins, the gfp-tagged usp17l or rfp-tagged usp17n, or both were transfected into hela cells. intriguingly, usp17l proteins are found in the nucleus and are concentrated at the nucleoli  similar to intracellular hyaluronan  <cit> . however, usp17n proteins are localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm . a merged format shows that usp17l and usp17n are localized in different regions . after  <dig> hours of transfection, cells expressing gfp-tagged usp17l showed the onset of irregular nuclear division and irregular morphology of overall cell shape compared with controls . in contrast, cells expressing rfp-tagged usp17n did not show any sign of apoptosis, suggesting that hyaluronan binding ability and the localization of usp <dig> subfamily proteins may be critical for regulating apoptosis leading to cell death.

regulation of cell viability
since it has been suggested that intracellular hyaluronan binding proteins are involved in tumor formation  <cit> , we next investigated whether the usp <dig> subfamily proteins are involved in the regulation of cell viability and cell cycle for cancer cells. in order to investigate the cellular roles of usp <dig> subfamily proteins, myc-tagged usp17l was transfected into hec-1a and hela cells to establish stable cell lines. however, we observed transfected cells undergoing apoptosis  and approximately  <dig> weeks later, all cells died. however, the transfection of either usp17l  or usp17n into the same cell lines did not result in any sign of apoptosis . this indicates that usp <dig> subfamily proteins containing hyaluronan binding motifs and their substrate may regulate cell viability. based on the observation of cell death for usp17l-transfected cells, we performed quantitative real-time pcr to compare fold change for the expression of caspase  <dig> as an indicator of apoptosis. the expression of caspase  <dig> showed more than two fold increase in usp17l-transfected cells compared with controls . however, the expression of caspase  <dig> in usp17l -transfected cells and in usp17n-transfected cells was similar to one in controls . all reactions were performed triplicate.

in order to confirm the apoptosis induced by usp <dig> subfamily proteins, usp17l was stably expressed by the tet-on system. the morphology of cells undergoing apoptosis was similar to that of ones transfected with pcdna3-myc-usp17l . therefore, we harvested the usp17l-expressing cells at  <dig> week intervals for  <dig> weeks and analyzed through facs analysis. the rate of apoptosis for cells expressing either usp17l or usp17l  was analyzed by double-staining with annexin v and pi . the cell stages of apoptosis were differentiated depending on the location in the quadrant  and   <cit> . the usp17l-expressing cells by the tet-on system undergoing the early stage apoptosis showed about  <dig>  fold increase compared with control hela cells and those undergoing late stage apoptosis showed about  <dig>  fold increase . however, the significant change was not observed in cells expressing usp17l  or usp17n . this experiment was performed triplicate.

discussion
the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway has diverse functions involved in the regulation of protein activity, indicating the importance of the system in eukaryotic cells. specific modulation by diverse deubiquitinating enzyme is a key process controlling many proteins associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome system. in this study, we isolated four novel members of usp <dig> subfamily and showed through sequence analysis that they have high degree of homology when compared with each other and usp <dig> . phylogenetic analysis for nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of usp <dig> subfamily members revealed that all novel genes were grouped into the usp <dig> subfamily . it has been recently reported that there are multiple homologous genomic sequences of usp <dig> subfamily, and one of them, dub- <dig>  encodes a cytokine-inducible deubiquitinating enzyme  <cit> . this is similar to murine dub subfamily members including dub- <dig>  dub- <dig>  dub-2a, and dub-1a  <cit> . however, whether they have distinct functions or polymorphisms remains to be seen.

since usp <dig> transcripts were expressed in various cancer cell lines and it has been suggested that intracellular hyaluronan binding proteins, which usp <dig> subfamily members belong to, are involved in tumor formation  <cit> , we investigated whether usp <dig> subfamily proteins are involved in cell growth and proliferation. interestingly, we observed that cancer cells  overexpressing usp <dig> subfamily proteins except usp17n appeared morphologically abnormal. in addition, facs analysis showed that double-staining of usp17l-expressing, but not usp17n-expressing cells with annexin v and pi revealed increased apoptosis . these results suggest that usp <dig> subfamily proteins containing hyaluronan and rna binding motifs are involved in signaling pathway of death for tumorigenic cells.

besides the fact that the overexpression of usp <dig> subfamily proteins induces apoptosis in cancer cells, the ability to bind with hyaluronan is another important point used to elucidate the cellular functions of usp <dig> subfamily proteins. hyaluronan is one of glycosaminoglycans and is believed to play various roles both in extracellular and pericellular matrices  <cit> . since enriched hyaluronan is found in various tumor tissues  <cit> , it was thought to be important for cancer. several evidences have been proposed to prove the connection between hyaluronan and tumor growth. therefore, hyaluronan is used as a marker for various cancers these days  <cit> . in addition, hyaluronan has been suggested that it is involved in the fundamental regulation of cell cycle, because hyaluronan is enriched in the nucleus during the cell division  <cit> . since usp <dig> subfamily proteins except usp17n binds to hyaluronan and induces cell death, it is possible that hyaluronan and/or rna binding domains of usp <dig> subfamily proteins may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle or tumorigenesis. another possibility is that hyaluronan may serve as a bridge between the usp <dig> subfamily enzymes and their potential substrates, which are intracellular hyaluronan-binding proteins. moreover, usp <dig> subfamily proteins are condensed at the nucleoli like hyaluronan dose, suggesting that usp <dig> subfamily proteins are involved in mrna stability or chromatin remodeling similar to functions of pai-rbp <dig> and ki-1/ <dig>  which are hyaluronan/rna binding motif-containing proteins  <cit> . due to the fact that in vivo deubiquitinating enzyme assay for usp <dig> subfamily members showed the extensive reduction of ubiquitination for cellular proteins , it is possible that a number of proteins including apoptosis-related proteins can be regulated by usp <dig> subfamily members. important direction for future studies should include the isolation and characterization of substrates for usp <dig>  this will help us to understand the cellular roles of usp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report that four novel usp <dig> subfamily members which encode a deubiquitinating enzyme have been identified and that the overexpression of these proteins leads to cell death. our study demonstrates that usp <dig> subfamily members, which regulate apoptosis and cell death of cancerous cells, contain putative hyaluronan and rna binding motifs. despite of a decade of research since the discovery of dub enzymes as an important molecule responsible for regulating protein degradation, much remains to be defined regarding their cellular functions. a better understanding of relation between usp <dig> subfamily proteins and cell viability will facilitate therapeutic strategies for regulation of cell proliferation.
