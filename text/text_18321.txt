BACKGROUND
rhipicephalus  spp. ticks are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world with range expansion for some species due to changes in climatic conditions  <cit> . infestations with the cattle tick, rhipicephalus  microplus, economically impact cattle production by reducing weight gain and milk production, and by transmitting pathogens that cause babesiosis  and anaplasmosis   <cit> . r. annulatus and r. decoloratus also affect cattle production and vector pathogens in regions of latin america, africa or asia  <cit> .

control of tick infestations has been difficult because ticks have few natural enemies. integrated tick management strategies include the adaptation of different control methods to a geographic area. a major component of integrated tick control methods is the application of acaricides. however, use of acaricides has had limited efficacy in reducing tick infestations and is often accompanied by serious drawbacks, including the selection of acaricide-resistant ticks, environmental contamination and contamination of milk and meat products with drug residues  <cit> . furthermore, development of new acaricides is a long and expensive process. all of these issues reinforce the need for alternative approaches to control tick infestations  <cit> . other approaches proposed for tick control have included the use of hosts with natural resistance to ticks, pheromone-impregnated decoys for attracting and killing ticks, biological control agents and vaccines  <cit> .

in the early 1990s, vaccines were developed that induced immunological protection of vertebrate hosts against tick infestations. these vaccines contained the recombinant r. microplus bm <dig> gut antigen  <cit> . two vaccines using recombinant bm <dig> were subsequently registered in latin american countries  and australia  during 1993– <dig>  <cit> . these vaccines reduce the number of engorging female ticks, their weight and reproductive capacity. thus the greatest vaccine effect was the reduction of larval infestations in subsequent generations. vaccine controlled field trials in combination with acaricide treatments demonstrated that an integrated approach resulted in control of tick infestations while reducing the use of acaricides  <cit> . these trials demonstrated that control of ticks by vaccination has the advantages of being cost-effective, reducing environmental contamination and preventing the selection of drug resistant ticks that result from repeated acaricide application. in addition, these vaccines may also prevent or reduce transmission of pathogens by reducing tick populations and/or affecting tick vectorial capacity  <cit> .

controlled immunization trials have shown that r. microplus bm86-containing vaccines also protect against related tick species, r. annulatus and r. decoloratus  <cit> . however, r. microplus strain-to-strain variations in the susceptibility to bm <dig> vaccination have been reported, which suggests that bm <dig> sequence and/or tick physiological differences may influence the efficacy of the vaccine  <cit> . therefore, the cloning, expression and vaccine formulation with recombinant bm <dig> from local tick strains may be required for vaccine efficacy in some geographic regions  <cit> .

the recombinant bm <dig> has been expressed in escherichia coli  <cit> , aspergillus nidulans and a. niger  <cit>  and pichia pastoris  <cit> . of these expression systems, p. pastoris has been shown to be the more efficient for protein secretion  <cit> . furthermore, production of bm <dig> in p. pastoris may increase the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the recombinant antigen  <cit> . however, the process previously reported for the production of recombinant bm <dig> in p. pastoris is not based on protein secretion but on the expression of the antigen anchored to the yeast membrane, making necessary the purification under denaturing conditions followed by refolding of an antigen with high number of disulfide bonds  <cit> . recently, r. decoloratus bm <dig> orthologs were cloned, expressed in e. coli and partially characterized  <cit> . however, the cloning and expression of recombinant r. annulatus and r. decoloratus bm <dig> orthologs in p. pastoris have not been reported.

the objectives of this study were  to clone and express in p. pastoris the recombinant r. microplus, r. decoloratus and r. annulatus bm <dig> orthologs from african or asian tick strains and  to simplify the bm <dig> production process by secreting recombinant proteins encoded by bm <dig> orthologs in p. pastoris.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba86
the bm <dig> orthologs were cloned by rt-pcr from mozambique r. microplus , israeli r. annulatus  and south african r. decoloratus  tick strains. partial sequences were obtained and used to search the ncbi nr database for sequence identity. the first four blast hits  showed that cloned bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> sequences were identical  to previously reported bm <dig> , bm <dig>  and bd86- <dig> and bd86- <dig>  sequences. the only fragment of  <dig>  nucleotides previously reported for ba <dig>  had  <dig> % identity to the ba <dig> sequence reported here with a single a × g substitution at position  <dig>  . the bm <dig> sequence of the mozambique r. microplus strain reported here had a deletion of  <dig> nucleotides between positions  <dig> and  <dig> not found in other bm <dig> sequences, which suggested that this region encoding for  <dig> amino acids may not be important for protein function. the bd <dig> sequence of the south african r. decoloratus strain had an  <dig> nucleotides insertion between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , similar to bd86- <dig> and three nucleotides longer than in bd86- <dig>  <cit> .

pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were conducted between cloned bm <dig>  ba <dig> and bd <dig> sequences and those identified above to have identity to these sequences . the results showed that sequence identity was higher between bm <dig> and ba <dig> than with bd <dig> sequences.

percent identity among nucleotide  and percent similarity among deduced amino acid  sequences between bm <dig> orthologs were determined. sequences were aligned and percent identity/similarity was determined using the program alignx. abbreviations: rm, r. microplus; ra, r. annulatus; rd, r. decoloratus. genbank accession numbers are shown in parenthesis. the sequences reported in this study are identified wth an asterisk.

production and characterization of p. pastoris strains for the expression of recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba86
the plasmids ppamoz <dig>  ppadec <dig> and pbai were transformed into p. pastoris strains gs <dig>  km71h and x <dig> for expression of recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> proteins. single colonies of p. pastoris transformants for each gene were grown in an orbital shaker under induction conditions. culture supernatants were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane for dot-blot analysis of recombinant proteins. expression of bm <dig> and bd <dig> was obtained in gs <dig> and km71h strains while ba <dig> was expressed in strain x <dig> only . expression levels varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg·l- <dig>  representing  <dig> % to  <dig> % of total proteins in the supernatant . for recombinant bm <dig> and bd <dig>  differences in expression levels were not observed between gs <dig> and km71h strains. the highest expression levels were obtained for ba <dig> in strain x <dig> . the recombinant strains gs115moz9- <dig>  km71hdec8- <dig> and x33pbai- <dig> with highest expression levels of bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig>  respectively, were selected for fermentation scale up in a 5-l bioreactor.

the experiments were conducted twice with similar results.

*recombinant strains with highest bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> concentration in the culture supernatant were selected for fermentation and protein production.

the gs115moz9- <dig>  km71hdec8- <dig> and x33pbai- <dig> high expression strains had a muts phenotype . it has been demonstrated that transformation of p. pastoris with plasmids using the aox <dig> expression system may lead to three mutant phenotypes with regard to methanol utilization  <cit> . the mut+ phenotype grows on methanol at the wild-type rate and requires high feeding rates of methanol, the muts phenotype has a disruption in the aox <dig> gene and has a slower specific growth rate in methanol and the mut- is unable to grow in methanol. although transformation of x- <dig> and gs <dig> strains with linearized constructs favor single crossover recombination at the aox <dig> locus and generates a mut+ phenotype, double crossover recombination that results in the disruption of the wild-type aox <dig> gene and the generation of a muts phenotype is possible. the p. pastoris strains with a muts phenotype grow slower in methanol but may be better hosts for the secretion of recombinant proteins  <cit> .

expression of recombinant ba <dig>  bd <dig> and bm <dig> proteins in p. pastoris
the gs115moz9- <dig>  km71hdec8- <dig> and x33pbai- <dig> strains were used for bench-top fermentation exploiting the methanol utilization ability of p. pastoris strains in pm medium. this medium was previously used for p. pastoris fermentations to express high levels of recombinant bm <dig>  <cit> .

the initial phase of the fermentation process  ended after 20– <dig> hrs and induction of recombinant protein expression started at the onset of methanol-adoption and utilization phases. as expected, all strains behaved similarly when growing on glycerol as the sole carbon source . cell densities before induction and maximum growth rates on glycerol were very similar and similar to those previously reported in p. pastoris  <cit> .

the selected fed-batch strategy to feed methanol was identical for all strains. once glycerol used as carbon source in the initial batch and fed-batch phases was consumed, recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of methanol to the culture medium. an exponential growth phase was then observed during the next 20– <dig> hrs with maximum growth rates of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig> for the strains gs115moz9- <dig>  km71hdec8- <dig> and x33pbai- <dig>  respectively. however, after  <dig> hrs growth in methanol, cells stop growing and a steady increase in po <dig> levels revealed that a stationary growth phase was achieved. nevertheless, total protein production continued to increase gradually to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg·l- <dig> for the strains gs115moz9- <dig>  km71hdec8- <dig> and x33pbai- <dig>  respectively .

in this first approach to obtain recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> secreted to the culture medium, methanol was supplied at  <dig> ml·h-1·l of the initial fermentation volume for the first two hrs and then methanol supply was increased in 10% increments every  <dig> min to a rate of  <dig> ml·h-1·l. this strategy probably did not allow maintaining a steady concentration of methanol throughout the whole fermentation process and either starvation or accumulation of methanol could have occurred. this fact may explain lower growth rates and expression levels of recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> when compared to the  <dig> g·l- <dig> dry weight and  <dig>  g·l- <dig> of recombinant protein previously reported for membrane-bound bm <dig> in p. pastoris  <cit> . these results suggest that recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> protein expression levels may be increased by the optimization of the fermentation and methanol induction processes.

the presence of recombinant proteins in the culture supernatant was demonstrated at the end of the fermentation process by sds-page and western blot . recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> secreted in p. pastoris appeared in sds-page and western blots as a major wide band with a size range of  <dig> to  <dig> kda and smaller degradation fragments . the recombinant bm <dig> previously expressed in p. pastoris also had degradation products and a major wide band, but with a size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda  <cit> . these differences in estimated molecular weight of the proteins may be due to strain differences in glycosylation, which is responsible for the wide appearance of the protein band in the sds-page and western blot  <cit> .

protein recovery and purification
to obtain a clarified supernatant for recombinant protein purification, a primary centrifugation step was performed at  <dig>  × g. due to the fact that p. pastoris culture centrifugation at g-forces between  <dig> – <dig>  results in a significant product entrainment  <cit> , a washing step of cell pellets was made for the full recovery of secreted proteins.

p. pastoris secretes few autologous proteins  <cit> . therefore, heterologous protein secretion serves as the major first step in recombinant protein purification. however, unclear supernatants and recombinant protein purities ranging between 55% and 66% suggested the presence of contaminants in the supernatant after cell separation . this observation suggested that probably cell lysis occurred during the stationary phase of the fermentation process due to suboptimal growth conditions. cell lysis during the fermentation may have contributed to protein degradation, thus affecting recombinant protein yield and reinforcing the need for optimization of the fermentation process to reduce protein degradation and increase expression levels.

abbreviations: conc., concentration; rec., recombinant.

it has been demonstrated in previous cell fractionation experiments of p. pastoris that a wide range of particles densities and sizes are present in a disrupted suspension of the yeast  <cit> . therefore, to separate particles in suspension from secreted recombinant proteins, supernatants were filtered throughout  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  μm filtration systems, which resulted in 20–25% increase in recombinant protein purity . finally, size exclusion and diafiltration through a  <dig> kda cut-off membrane resulted in 80–85% pure recombinant proteins .

the purity of recombinant proteins reported herein after protein secretion and a simple centrifugation-filtration purification process was higher than that obtained for membrane-bound bm <dig>  <cit> . the purification of the membrane-bound bm <dig> required cell disruption, washing of cell pellet, denaturation, renaturation and protein precipitation procedures  <cit> . in spite of the high level expression obtained during fermentation  <cit>  and the optimization of the purification process  <cit>  for the membrane-bound bm <dig>  the secretion of recombinant bm <dig> in p. pastoris reported herein allowed for higher recovery and purity of recombinant protein after purification.

additionally, an important advantage of secreting recombinant proteins in p. pastoris, particularly for proteins with complex structures and a high number of disulfide bonds such as bm <dig>  <cit> , is that the isolation of a membrane-bound form under denaturing conditions followed by refolding is very unlikely to reform all disulfide bonds correctly and reproducibly. by contrast, if disulfide bond formation occurs through the natural cell processing and secretion machinery as reported herein, the product is more likely to have a reproducible conformation closely resembling the native protein.

the recombinant bm <dig> has been expressed in e. coli  <cit> , a. nidulans and a. niger  <cit>  and p. pastoris  <cit> . other expression systems using arthropod cell lines have been considered. however, despite recent advances in the application of insect cell culture technology for the production of recombinant proteins, the process is still more expensive and difficult to scale-up when compared to proteins expressed in e. coli and p. pastoris  <cit> . the secretion of recombinant bm <dig> ortholog proteins reported here in p. pastoris is easy to scale-up, simple, reproducible and likely to result in a product with high antigenicity and immunogenicity  <cit> .

characterization of recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba86
although differences may exist in antigen recognition between cattle and rabbits  <cit> , rabbits have been proven to recognize some bm <dig> protective epitopes  <cit>  and were therefore considered a suitable host to evaluate immune cross-reactivity between recombinant bm <dig> ortholog proteins.

the purified recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> were adjuvated and used to immunize rabbits. the sera from immune rabbits were used to evaluate by western blot the immune cross-reactivity between bm <dig> ortholog proteins. the results showed that recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> contained cross-reactive epitopes . these results are in agreement with previous reports for bd <dig>  <cit>  and may explain, at least in part, the efficacy of the bm86-containing vaccine against r. annulatus and r. decoloratus infestations  <cit> . however, despite immune cross-reactivity between bm <dig> ortholog proteins, the differences in the efficacy of bm86-containing vaccines against different rhipicephalus spp. may be attributed to differences in the sequence of protective epitopes and/or physiological differences between tick species. only cattle vaccination experiments with the recombinant antigens obtained here and challenging with homologous and heterologous rhipicephalus spp. could fully address this question.

CONCLUSIONS
we have cloned and secreted in p. pastoris the recombinant r. microplus, r. decoloratus and r. annulatus bm <dig> orthologs from african or asian tick strains. to our knowledge, this is the first study of bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> secretion in p. pastoris. the results reported herein have shown that in p. pastoris, bm <dig> ortholog recombinant proteins are secreted and purified from the culture supernatant with high yield and purity. the purification process for secreted proteins was simpler than that described for membrane-bound bm <dig>  which suggests the possibility of simplifying the purification process for recombinant bm <dig> when secreted in p. pastoris. additionally, secretion of recombinant bm <dig> ortholog proteins in p. pastoris is likely to result in a more reproducible conformation closely resembling the native protein. finally, the preliminary immunological characterization of recombinant bm <dig>  bd <dig> and ba <dig> evidenced the presence of cross-reactive epitopes among these proteins. these results suggest that these recombinant antigens can be used for the development of vaccines for the control of tick infestations in africa. the control of livestock rhipicephalus spp. infestations in africa would contribute to improve animal health and production in this region.
