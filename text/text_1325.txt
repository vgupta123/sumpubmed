BACKGROUND
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy  provides useful information on the neurochemical profile in different neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . it is a non-invasive method which allows the investigation of the chemical profile of defined target volumes in subjects in vivo. examples of measurable metabolites are n-acetylaspartate  a marker for neuronal density and/or function, myo-inositol  a marker for astrogliosis and/or osmotic stress and choline  a marker for cell membrane turnover and degradation  <cit> . brain metabolites are sensitive to pathological processes in neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease   <cit> .

ad is one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . the clinical symptoms of ad include progressive memory impairment, disordered cognitive functions, altered behaviour including paranoia, delusions, loss of social appropriateness and decline in language functions. the majority of the prevalent ad cases are sporadic. the small percentage of remaining ad cases are familial and connected to specific gene mutations  <cit> .

there are few approved treatment options for ad. one of them is the administration of acetylcholine-esterase  inhibitors, like donepezil which enhances the life of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the synapse and thus increases the cholinergic neurotransmission  <cit> . symptomatically, donepezil improves cognitive functions in ad patients <cit> . using magnetic resonance spectroscopy  in patients, brain metabolites and neurotransmitters can be non-invasively measured and effects on brain naa levels caused by donepezil have been reported  <cit> . moreover, effects on m-ins and cho in hippocampus of ad patients treated with donepezil have been observed  <cit> .

different animal models that express one or more mutant proteins associated with ad allow us to study different features of ad  <cit> . while some models may express different levels of β-amyloid  <cit> , other models modulate the production of tangles  <cit> . we investigated the neurochemical profile of the double transgenic  app/ps <dig> mouse  <cit>  during maturation and ageing in a previous study  <cit> . as a continuation of this, we have investigated the effects of donepezil treatment in the same mouse model. the app/ps <dig> mouse coexpresses the mutated forms of human β-amyloid precursor protein  and mutated human presenilin  <dig>  and thus reflects important features of the neurochemical profile in humans  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of monitoring early donepezil treatment effects in young app/ps <dig> mice with the combination of multivariate data analysis and mrs. by doing so we wanted to observe changes in the metabolic pattern as well as in individual metabolites. we did not expect significant changes in the levels of naa and m-ins as previously reported in humans treated with donepezil. we based this on the fact that these metabolites are not altered in the app/ps <dig> mice model until later in their development. our hypothesis was based on the multivariate model looking at the underlying metabolic pattern rather than individual metabolites. however, we believed the levels of choline were most likely to be altered, since choline is a precursor of acetylcholine and donepezil is an inhibitor of acetylcholine-esterase.

RESULTS
magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
1h-mrs was used to monitor differences in metabolite contents in vivo before and after donepezil treatment in app/ps <dig> mice. also wt mice were investigated before and after treatment. two different volumes of interest  were used in this study. the first one included parietal cortex and hippocampus  and the second voi was placed in striatum . fig. 1a  and 1b  demonstrates the placement of the two different volumes of interest. a representative spectrum from ctx/hipp of a wt mouse is shown in fig. 1c and a representative spectrum from str is shown in fig. 1d. six different variables  were quantified using the software lcmodel. these were tnaa/tcr, tcho/tcr, tau/tcr, m-ins/tcr, glu/tcr and gln/tcr. mean metabolic ratios for all groups are shown in table  <dig>

multivariate data analysis was used to compare differences between mice before and after treatment. first we compared spectra from ctx/hipp in app/ps <dig> mice. fig. 2a shows a scatter plot of the pls-da group comparison between app/ps <dig> mice before and after treatment. a significant separation  between the groups can be observed. the first principle component  describes 49% of the variance of the original data. leave-one-out cross validation predicted 6/ <dig> treated animals and 5/ <dig> untreated animals correctly . there were no effects on the brain metabolites in the non-treated app/ps <dig> mice. moreover, no effect was observed on the metabolites in ctx/hipp in donepezil or untreated wt mice .

we then investigated spectra from str in app/ps <dig> and wt mice before and after treatment. there is a clear separation between app/ps <dig> animals before and after treatment with donepezil . there is one significant  component that explains 75% of the variance of the original data. leave-one-out cross validation predicted 5/ <dig> treated animals and 5/ <dig> untreated animals correctly . interestingly, we also noted a separation between the spectra targeted in str of untreated app/ps <dig> mice . the first principle component  explains 58% of the variance of the original data. leave-one-out cross validation predicted 4/ <dig> treated animals and 4/ <dig> untreated animals correctly .

a treatment effect of donepezil was also observed in str for wt mice . one significant component is seen  to explain 38% of the variance of the original data and leave-one-out cross validation predicted 9/ <dig> treated animals and 8/ <dig> untreated animals correctly . no effect in str of wt animals receiving saline injections was observed .

metabolite ratios of importance for separation between groups
pls-da modelling pinpoints metabolite ratios which are responsible for the separation between groups. metabolite ratios with a variable of importance  value larger than one are over average responsible for the differences. hence, it can be seen that the most important metabolite ratios for the separation of app/ps <dig> mice before and after donepezil treatment were tau/tcr and gln/tcr for measurements in ctx/hipp  and tau/tcr, tcho/tcr, m-ins/tcr for measurement in str . interestingly, there were also differences in the metabolic fingerprint in untreated app/ps <dig> mice in str. this might indicate changes caused by disease progress. the metabolite ratios that were responsible for these differences were tcho/tcr and tnaa/tcr . moreover, metabolite ratios of importance for the separation for treated wt mice in str  were glu/tcr and tcho/tcr.

all individual metabolite ratios of importance for the separations between different groups were tested for their statistical significance using the paired t-test. as depicted in fig 2c, tau/tcr was significantly decreased in ctx/hipp in app/ps <dig> mice during the four weeks of treatment . however, there was no statistically significant difference for gln/tcr after treatment in these mice. moreover, for app/ps <dig> mice a significant decrease in tau/tcr  in str  was seen, which is in line with the measurements from ctx/hipp. the metabolite ratio tcho/tcr was significantly increased in str  in app/ps <dig> mice  after donepezil treatment. the metabolite tcho/tcr was also significantly increased in str in the untreated app/ps <dig> mice  . as can be observed when comparing fig. 3d and fig. 4c the increase in tcho/tcr is smaller in donepezil treated than in untreated app/ps <dig> mice. this was statistically verified using a two-sample t-test . the other metabolite ratios of importance for the separation between treated and untreated animals for app/ps <dig> mice did not reach statistical significance on an individual level. for wt mice the only metabolite ratio reaching statistical significance was glu/tcr  .

acetylcholine-esterase  activity
to test the effect of donepezil as an acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor, the brains of wt and tg mice were analyzed for acetylcholine-esterase activity at the end of the treatment . there was a significant difference between treated and non treated wt mice . in the app/ps <dig> mice the mean activity in donepezil treated animals was seemingly lower than the mean of animals receiving nacl injections; however it did not reach statistical significance.

discussion
multivariate data analysis
we have demonstrated that by employing a combination of 1h-mrs and multivariate data analysis, it is possible to observe a treatment effect of donepezil in parietal cortex/hippocampus and in striatum of app/ps <dig> mice. we also found a treatment effect in wt mice in str, but not in ctx/hipp. interestingly, the tau/tcr ratio was decreased in str and ctx/hipp of app/ps <dig> mice due to donepezil treatment. we also found a less pronounced increase in tcho/tcr in str for treated app/ps <dig> mice compared to untreated.

this shows that multivariate data analysis is a powerful tool in analyzing complex biological data and that it is possible to monitor treatment effects at an early stage. the strength of multivariate data analysis compared to traditional univariate data analysis methods, such as the t-test, is that it correlates the different metabolites to each other and considers them all simultaneously. by doing so, it is possible to observe patterns in the data not possible when looking at the metabolites one by one.

the most significant separation between groups before and after treatment was seen in str in app/ps <dig> mice. a significant separation, although less pronounced, was also seen in ctx/hipp of app/ps <dig> mice. different density and levels of expression of ache in ctx/hipp and str may partly explain this variance. in line with this, we saw a significant separation between wt mice before and after treatment of donepezil in str but not in ctx/hipp.

tau/tcr decrease in donepezil treated app/ps <dig> mice in parietal cortex/hippocampus and striatum
tau is a free amino acid present in the brain. areas in the brain which contain the highest concentrations of tau are dorsal striatum and hippocampus  <cit> . this metabolite is reported to be involved in a number of biological functions. it acts as an organic osmolyte in the brain, involved in cell volume regulation. another role of taurine is modulation of the actions of neurotransmitters. the concentration of tau is much higher in rodent brains than in human brains  <cit> . dedeoglu et al showed an increase in tau in aged app transgenic mice . since tau plays a role in osmoregulation, similar to the role of m-ins in humans, this increase is suggested to reflect a similar process to that which increased m-ins plays in human ad  <cit> . marijanska et al showed an increase in m-ins in app/ps <dig> mice  and no increase in tau suggesting that this mouse model most closely matches the neurochemical profile of human ad  <cit> . when we investigated app/ps <dig> mice aged  <dig>  to  <dig>  months, we found no increase in tau/tcr nor in m-ins/tcr in app/ps <dig> mice  <cit> . since no change of tau/tcr in app/ps <dig> mice was detected within the first  <dig> months of life, the observed decrease in tau/tcr in the present study indicates that it is a direct effect of donepezil treatment. this is supported by the fact that the decrease in tau/tcr was observed in both ctx/hipp and str, which are both brain regions with high concentrations of tau. also no effect on tau/tcr was seen in untreated app/ps <dig> mice. finally, no decrease in tau/tcr was seen in wt mice receiving donepezil. it has previously been shown in rats that levels of the amino-acid tau are lowered following treatment with another ache inhibitor   <cit> . it was further suggested that the ache inhibitor, metrifonate has additional properties which modulate other neurochemical systems than the cholinergic  <cit> .

the decrease in tau may be directly connected to the cholinergic activity, which is the target of many anti-ad drugs. it has been shown that tau inhibits the release of ach  <cit> . this suggests that lower levels of tau lead to a reduced inhibitory tone, resulting in increased cholinergic activity  <cit> .

progressive increase in striatal tcho/cr of app/ps <dig> mice is partially mitigated by donepezil treatment
we observed a significant increase in striatal tcho/tcr of app/ps <dig> mice. however, this increase was significantly lower in mice receiving donepezil compared to mice receiving saline. we interpret the observed increase in the levels of tcho/tcr in striatum of app/ps <dig> mice to be an effect of the disease process. this is in line with human patient studies, where elevations in choline concentrations have also been measured with mrs  <cit> . the increase we observed is less pronounced in the animals receiving donepezil treatment, which is in line with a recent mrs study demonstrating a decrease in tcho levels in probable ad patients treated with donepezil  <cit> . in this study bartha et al. suggest that the change in tcho they observed in ad patients could reflect a decrease in phosphatidylcholine catabolism leading to lower levels of tcho containing compounds, which are required precursors for acetylcholine synthesis. the substances that mainly contribute to the choline peak in a mrs spectrum are free choline, glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine  <cit> . choline is a precursor of acetylcholine and it is also a product of membranial phosphatidylcholine breakdown  <cit> . in ad there are losses of cholinergic neurons and it was shown in vitro that levels of free choline and glycerophosphorylcholine are higher in ad brains  <cit> . moreover, higher levels of choline may be explained by an increased cell membrane phospholipid turnover in demented brains  <cit> 

the target of donepezil is to inhibit the acetylcholine breakdown by decreasing cholinesterase activity. our results are in full agreement with the studies discussed above and they demonstrate a progressive increase in striatal tcho/cr, which is partially mitigated by donepezil treatment in this mouse model of alzheimer's disease.

glu/tcr increase in donepezil treated wt mice in striatum
glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain. there is no specific theory on the role of glutamate in ad. in general a decrease in glutamate is suggested to be due to the death of glutamatergic cortical neurons and an increase may reflect a potentially neurotoxic effect. glutamate also has a role in synaptic plasticity and because of this it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in learning and memory. we observed an increase in the glu/tcr ratio in the striatum of wt mice after donepezil treatment. this finding is somewhat unexpected and at present we have no plausible explanation. these changes in glutamate might be connected to increased cholinergic activity but we cannot rule out the possibility of direct effects on glutamate levels from donepezil. further studies are required to investigate these findings.

acetylcholine-esterase  activity
donepezil significantly decreased the acetylcholine-esterase activity in wt mice, which might explain the increased levels of glu/tcr due to increased cholinergic activity. however, donepezil did not significantly decrease the acetylcholine-esterase activity in app/ps <dig> mice. there are several different explanations for this. one of the reasons could be the small number of app/ps <dig> mice tested compared to wt mice. another reason is the dose of donepezil used. in order to confirm that the right dose was used, a dose response study is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
treatment effects of the acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor, donepezil can be detected in str and ctx/hipp of app/ps <dig> mice by analyzing in vivo mrs data with multivariate data analysis . a disease dependent tcho/tcr increase was observed in str of app/ps <dig> mice. this increase was significantly lower in app/ps <dig> mice receiving donepezil, which reflects a reversal of the levels of this metabolite ratio. moreover we found a decrease in tau/tcr level in both str and ctx/hipp s in app/ps <dig> mice as a result of donepezil treatment. both the decrease in tau/tcr and the less pronounced increase in the tcho/tcr level might possibly be mediated by changed cholinergic activity as a result of the donepezil treatment.
