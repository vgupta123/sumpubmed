BACKGROUND
atp-binding cassette  proteins constitute one of the largest protein superfamilies and are present in all organisms from bacteria to human  <cit> . prototypical abc proteins are membrane-bound transporters coupling atp hydrolysis to the translocation of substrates across biological membranes  <cit> . in addition to transporters, abc proteins also comprise ion channels, regulators of ion channels, receptors, and proteins with roles in ribosome assembly and translation. the human genome has  <dig> genes encoding abc proteins, of which  <dig> have been linked to hereditary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, stargardt disease and disorders of cholesterol metabolism  <cit> .

abc proteins share a conserved domain architecture. a functional transporter requires the cooperation of two transmembrane domains  and two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains . eukaryotic abc proteins are either full transporters combining all required domains in one polypeptide , or half-transporters consisting of  <dig> tmd and  <dig> nbd that need to form homo- or heterodimers to constitute a functional pump. according to their domain architecture and sequence, metazoan abc transporters are divided into subfamilies, of which seven  exist in human  <cit> . an eighth subfamily  has been defined following the analysis of the drosophila melanogaster genome  <cit> . the h subfamily is missing in mammals, but has one member in zebrafish  <cit> . the members of subfamilies e and f are not transporters and differ from other abc proteins in that they possess two nbds but lack tmds. abce proteins are inhibitors of rnase l and involved in the assembly of the preinitiation complex  <cit> , while abcf proteins have roles in ribosome assembly and protein translation  <cit> .

the first eukaryotic abc transporter discovered was the human  drug efflux transporter mdr  p-glycoprotein , the name of which reflects that its expression in cancers can cause a decreased cellular drug accumulation , resulting in the resistance of tumours against chemotherapy  <cit> . subsequent studies have identified further abc proteins that are drug efflux pumps and can cause mdr in cancers, including the multidrug resistance associated protein   <cit>  and the breast cancer related protein   <cit> . drug efflux transporters are found in abc subfamilies b, c and g  <cit> , and in normal tissues often show an apical expression in epithelia involved in excretion or forming boundaries of the body, reflecting their role in the biochemical defence against toxicants  <cit> . abc drug efflux transporters have a wide phylogenetic distribution and are found in vertebrates as well as in deuterostome invertebrates , protostome invertebrates , protozoans and yeast  <cit> . homologous proteins are also present in plants, though their roles in multidrug efflux have not been firmly established  <cit> .

the planktic crustacean daphnia is globally distributed and has central importance for the ecology of lakes and ponds. the currently accomplished sequencing of the daphnia pulex genome will thus enhance research in disciplines which traditionally have made use of daphnids, e.g., ecology, physiology, toxicology, population genetics and behaviour. moreover, studies with an evolutionary perspective are further expected to benefit, because daphnia is not only the first crustacean, but also the first non-insect arthropod to have its genome sequence determined. the aim of this study was to provide a survey of the abc transporter gene family of daphnia pulex. a complete or close to complete list of abc transporters in daphnia will facilitate the identification of genes that play a role during the adaptation of daphnia to environmental toxicants. furthermore, abc genes have been suggested as biochemical factors contributing to the phenomenon of resistance against chemotherapeutics in parasites  <cit>  and insects  <cit> . in the aquaculture industry, parasitic crustaceans constitute a problem of considerable economic importance. the potential development of resistances against therapeutics used to control the crustacean parasite sea louse  in salmon farming is currently becoming a concern, and it has recently been proposed that abc transporters in the sea louse could represent potential biochemical resistance factors to emamectin, a therapeutic used to control sea louse infestations in salmon  <cit> . at the same time, the sulfonylurea receptor has been suggested to represent the target for the chitin synthesis inhibitor diflubezuron  <cit> , a compound also used to treat sea lice infections. thus, abc transporters might have relevance in crustaceans both as biochemical defence mechanisms against toxicants, and as targets of toxicity.

from an evolutionary perspective, the wide distribution of abc transporters capable of drug efflux transport suggests they are of ancestral origin. however, abc subfamilies containing drug transporters  also comprise proteins with other functions. for instance, the arguably best known drug efflux pump habcb1/mdr <dig> belongs to the b subfamily that also contains mammalian transporters of bile salts and phospholipids, and yeast transporters of pheromones. because of the lack of clear orthologous relationships between abc proteins of the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans and those of other genomes, it has been suggested that drug efflux pumps have evolved independently several times  <cit> . the annotation of abc transporters in the daphnia genome, provided by this work, represents an important resource for future biochemical, toxicological and physiological studies of abc drug efflux transporters

RESULTS
to identify gene loci encoding abc transporters, multiple tblastn searches were performed on the dappu v <dig>  draft genome sequence assembly   <cit>  using nbds of different drosophila melanogaster abc proteins as queries . the most plausible gene model was selected among machine-generated models available at wfleabase  and the jgi genome portal , and its nbds extracted for phylogenetic analysis that further included nbds of fruit fly and human abc transporters. this resulted in a subfamily-specific clustering of nbds, with n- and c-terminal nbds of full transporters generally allocated to distinct sub-clusters . based on the clustering of nbds, daphnia transporters were assigned to abc subfamilies. gene models were refined on the basis of sequence homology and est support, and the subfamily assignment confirmed by protein blast analyses on the national center for biotechnology information website. using this strategy,  <dig> loci of putative daphnia abc genes were identified, for  <dig> of which evidence of mrna expression was present in est databases implemented in the jgi genome portal and wfeabase  . the majority of potential daphnia abc genes lacking est support  were found in subfamilies g and h , in which a high number of gene duplications was observed . significant sequence homologies to the query nbds were observed at further  <dig> loci that were excluded from further analysis . of these loci, four corresponded to obvious pseudogenes, while two most likely represent bacterial contamination. at the remaining nine excluded loci, the best obtainable gene models were fragmentary, i.e. showing lack/incompleteness of vital domains, with many models being affected by sequence gaps. all excluded loci lacked est evidence of expression.

subfamily
the column 'location' gives the scaffold number followed by the position coordinates of the gene model of the given protein id in v <dig>  of the daphnia pulex draft genome sequence assembly  <cit> .

to analyse the evolutionary position of the  <dig> putative daphnia abc transporters identified, phylogenetic analyses compared the complement of abc proteins in the daphnia genome to that in the genomes of yeast , fruit fly , worm  and human , using predicted  or database derived protein sequences . for two reasons, separate analyses were carried out for each subfamily. firstly, the domain architecture of abc transporters is highly variable among subfamilies, which complicates bioinformatic analyses on whole length sequences of the whole protein family. secondly, while the nbds of different transporters show a similar length and organisation, their sequence is too conserved to provide a meaningful degree of resolution in phylogenetic analysis.

abca
abca subfamily proteins are full transporters characterised by distinctive conserved traits, in particular a large extracellular loop between the first two transmembrane helices of each tmd, and a family specific motif located c-terminal of each nbf  <cit> . four abca subfamily transporters presenting these hallmarks  have been identified in daphnia . an analysis of the evolutionary relationship of these transporters to human, worm, and fruit fly abca proteins is shown in fig.  <dig>  dappu- <dig> and dappu- <dig> are neighbouring genes showing a head-to-tail orientation  and display 59% amino acid identity, suggesting they are the result of a tandem duplication. dappu- <dig> and dappu- <dig> group together with habca1/abc <dig>  habca <dig>  habca4/abcr and habca <dig>  dappu- <dig> groups together with the habca <dig> cluster . dappu- <dig> groups together with habca <dig>  in mammals, abca proteins adopt critical roles in the control of cellular lipid transport processes. loss-of-function scenarios in human monogenetic diseases and mouse knockout models have revealed roles of habca1/abc <dig> in hdl biogenesis, of habca <dig> in lung surfactant production, of habca4/abcr in retinal integrity and of abca <dig> in keratinisation processes in the skin  <cit> . thus, while abca proteins share a functional relation to lipid trafficking, individual transporters in this subfamily have adopted highly specialised roles in phospho- and sphingolipid export machineries  <cit> . in consequence, it is not possible to assign specific putative roles to the daphnia abca transporters, though it appears likely that they are involved in lipid trafficking processes.

abcb
the abcb family can be divided into a group of full transporters  that includes the drug efflux pump habcb1/mdr <dig>  and a group of half transporters . two abcb fts and five abcb hts were found in the daphnia genome . the evolutionary analysis of abcb ft assigned the human, worm, and arthropod  transporters into clearly distinguished clades , suggesting that this subfamily has diversified through lineage-specific gene duplications. early reports have noted the similarity in sequence of three drosophila abcb fts and habcb1/mdr <dig>  and named these genes mdr <dig>  mdr <dig>  and mdr <dig>  <cit> . while no further information is available on mdr <dig>  the drosophila gene most closely related to the two daphnia abcb fts, a number of studies suggests a role of mdr <dig> and to a lesser extent also mdr <dig> in the biochemical defence against toxicants. the disruption of the mdr <dig> gene resulted in an increase in colchicine resistance  <cit> . a genetic polymorphism related to α-amatin resistance in drosophila was mapped to the region of the mdr <dig> gene  <cit> . colchicine exposure and heat shock increases the expression of mdr <dig>  but not mdr <dig>  in drosophila larvae, while both genes were induced in tumours  <cit> . mdr <dig> was further found to be induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and shown to be involved in the transport of these chemicals  <cit> .

the phylogenetic analysis of abcb ht revealed comparatively clear orthologue relations . human mitochondrial transporters habcb <dig>  habcb <dig>  habcb8/mabc <dig> and habcb10/mabc <dig> function in iron metabolism and transport of fe/s protein precursors. the habcb <dig>  habcb <dig>  and habcb8/mabc <dig> proteins each have one orthologue in daphnia . the habcb10/mabc <dig> protein has two daphnia co-orthologues, dappu- <dig> and dappu- <dig>  which show high similarity . the human transporter associated with antigen processing  is a heterodimer of two abcb proteins, habcb2/tap <dig> and abcb3/tap <dig>  <cit> . tap translocates peptides derived from proteasomal degradation from the cytosol to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where their loading onto major histocompatibility complex  class i molecules occurs  <cit> . the function of habcb9/tapl  is currently unknown and its subcellular localisation is still under discussion  <cit> . it has been shown that tapl is present in the lysosomal compartment  <cit> , and it has been recently suggested that it might be involved in peptide presentation to mhc class ii in dendritic cells  <cit> . as invertebrates lack the mammalian adaptive immune response, the lack of tap/tapl homologues in daphnia and drosophila  is not unexpected. however, the presence of proteins orthologous to tap/tapl in c. elegans  suggests that these protein transporters might have further roles unrelated to antigen presentation.

abcc
the abcc subfamily is functionally diverse, comprising the chloride channel cftr , the membrane-bound receptors surs , and broad-specificity transporters called multidrug resistance-associated proteins  that translocate a range of substrates including drugs, endogenous compounds and their glutathione and glucuronyl conjugates, glutathione, and cyclic nucleotides  <cit> . abcc subfamily proteins are full-transporters showing two tmds and two nbds. within the human abcc family, habcc8/sur <dig>  habcc9/sur <dig> and certain mrps called 'long' mrps are unique in that they possess an additional n-terminal tmd called tmd <dig> which is lacking in habcc7/cftr and the remaining 'short' mrps  <cit> . searches of the daphnia genome identified seven abcc transporters . the phylogenetic tree of daphnia, human, worm, and drosophila abcc proteins is characterised by comparatively low support of the more basal nodes, most probably reflecting the heterogeneity of the abcc subfamily . dappu- <dig> is found in the same, well supported clade as human and drosophila surs, suggesting it is a sur homologue. indeed, dappu- <dig> displays a general architecture of sur and 'long' mrps, possessing the additional n-terminal tmd <dig> . moreover, dappu- <dig> shows a significant conservation of two sur typical n-terminal motifs, the sulphonylurea receptor family signature  and the sulphonylurea receptor type  <dig> family signature , with predicted amino acid similarities to habcc8/sur <dig> of 73% and 61%, respectively . together with previous reports of sur-typical functional traits of the drosophila protein cg <dig>  <cit> , the data strongly suggests that dappu- <dig> is indeed a sur. further daphnia abcc proteins possessing an additional n-terminal tmd <dig> are dappu- <dig> and dappu- <dig> . in our phylogenetic analysis dappu- <dig> groups together with drosophila cg <dig> , which is a long mrp resembling habcc1/mrp <dig> but awaiting in-depth functional characterisation  <cit> . according to the tree obtained in this study, dappu- <dig> is a putative orthologue of habcc10/mrp <dig> and drosophila cg <dig> . habcc10/mrp <dig> is capable of conferring a habcc1/mrp1-type multidrug resistance phenotype in cellular models, but its physiological function is at present poorly understood  <cit> . functional data are lacking on cg <dig>  the remaining daphnia mrps, dappu- <dig>  dappu- <dig>  dappu- <dig>  and dappu- <dig>  show the structural traits of 'short' mrps . the habcc4/mrp <dig> protein groups together with dp <dig> in a clade of moderately low bootstrap support  and is the abcc transporter showing the greatest similarity to the daphnia protein . dappu- <dig>  dappu- <dig>  and dappu- <dig> group together with habcc5/mrp <dig> in a clade of high bootstrap support . the habcc4/mrp <dig> and habcc5/mrp <dig> proteins have been reported to be able to transport cyclic nucleotides in vitro, but the in vivo relevance of this observation is controversial and their physiological roles remain to be unravelled  <cit> . dappu- <dig> groups together in one clade with habcc4/mrp <dig> and a cluster of drosophila abcc proteins including cg <dig> . cg <dig> is regulated by heavy metals via the metal-responsive transcription factor  <dig>  and has been shown to be involved in biochemical detoxification of zinc and copper  <cit> . this parallels previous studies showing that cell lines overexpressing habcc1/mrp <dig> are resistant to arsenite and antimony . together these data suggest daphnia mrps could represent potential biochemical factors in the defence against toxicants; however, in the absence of functional data and in the view of the complex phylogeny of the abcc subfamily this remains at present speculative.

abcd
the abcd subfamily contains half transporters located to the peroxisome that are involved in the import of fatty acids and/or fatty acyl-coas into this organelle  <cit> . the simultaneous posttranscriptional silencing of three c. elegans abcd transporters disrupted offspring production in a previous study, suggesting developmental roles of peroxisomal abc transporters  <cit> . mutations in the habcd1/aldp gene are the principal inherited defect in adrenoleukodystrophy, a clinically heterogeneous x-linked recessive disorder characterised by adrenal insufficiency and neuronal demyelination  <cit> . this study identified three abcd transporters in the daphnia genome, dappu- <dig>  dappu- <dig>  and dappu- <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis revealed that three clades of abcds exist in metazoans, each of which has one daphnia member . the high degree of conservation  and the clear structure of the phylogenetic tree are consistent with the notion that the function of abcd proteins in daphnia might resemble that in other metazoans.

abce and abcf
the subfamilies abce and abcf are comprised of atypical abc proteins that contain a pair of linked nucleotide binding domains and lack transmembrane domains  <cit> . the proteins of both subfamilies are highly conserved across evolutionary diverse taxa, suggesting their role in fundamental cell biological processes. most eukaryotes possess one abce protein, and daphnia conforms to this rule . human abce1/rnaseli was initially identified as an inhibitor of rnase l  <cit> . recent data indicate that human and yeast abce proteins have further a central role in translation initiation  <cit> . abcf proteins have roles in ribosome assembly and/or protein translation  <cit> . four abcf proteins have been identified in daphnia . the phylogenetic analysis of abce and abcf proteins was carried out together . as expected, dappu- <dig> fell into the clade containing other abce proteins. abcf proteins were divided into four well-supported clades, one of which contained only yeast proteins, while the remaining three each contained one of the human abcfs . of the daphnia abcf proteins, of which dappu- <dig> and dappu- <dig> show 53% amino acid identity and are homologues to habcf <dig>  while dappu- <dig> and dappu- <dig> are homologues to habcf <dig> and habcf <dig>  respectively.

abcg
as half transporters, abcg proteins need to form homo- or hetero dimers to form a functional pump. in contrast to other abc half transporters, abcg proteins show a reverse domain architecture, with the tmd being located c-terminally of the nbd. in human, habcg1/white <dig> and habcg <dig> are involved in cellular cholesterol efflux to high density lipoprotein, habcg <dig> and habcg <dig> mediate the intestinal and biliary efflux of cholesterol, plant, and shellfish sterols, while habcg2/bcrp is a drug efflux pump  <cit> . the most intensively studied abcg protein is the white protein in drosophila, which dimerises with abcg proteins brown and scarlet to function as a transporter of eye pigment precursors  <cit> . in yeast and in plants, certain abcg subfamily proteins are reverse full transporters and called pdr  proteins  <cit> . because of their duplicated domain structure , yeast pdrs were not included in the phylogenetic analyses of this study.

the identification of daphnia abc transporters revealed that in this species abcg proteins form the largest abc subfamily . this parallels the situation in drosophila  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of the abcg subfamily revealed that the high number of abcg genes in daphnia and drosophila is due to extensive lineage specific gene duplications . it is know that the genomes of flies and worms contain a large number of duplicated genes, with a greater number of tandem or locally duplicated genes in the c. elegans than the drosophila genome  <cit> . a large number of c. elegans annotated genes might be pseudogenes  <cit> . a similar situation seems to exist in daphnia, at least with respect to the abcg  family, which comprises several clusters of putative genes located in close vicinity displaying high predicted amino acid sequence similarity , and which further show a high number of loci lacking est support . it seems premature, however, to conclude that the non-expressed putative abc gene loci  are pseudogenes. for instance, a detailed functional analysis of tandem duplicated abc genes in the worm has revealed differential function of the duplicates, with expression being highly tissue or stage specific  <cit> .

in the phylogenetic analysis of abcg proteins from the daphnia and other genomes, dappu- <dig> and nine further daphnia proteins forms a clade  that consists of a cluster of eight neighbouring genes on scaffold  <dig> and two neighbouring genes on scaffold  <dig> . further down, dappu- <dig> groups together with drosophila proteins cg <dig> and atet  as well as habcg <dig> and  <dig>  dappu- <dig> is a homologue of the drosophila et <dig> gene product protein cg <dig>  an abcg transporter believed to regulate intracellular ecdysone concentrations during development  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses grouped dappu- <dig> together in one clade with habcg <dig> and  <dig>  and two drosophila proteins of unknown function. among the drosophila eye pigment transporters, the protein brown  does not have a daphnia orthologue, dappu- <dig> is an orthologue of the scarlet protein , while the drosophila white protein has nine co-orthologues in daphnia. assuming that these proteins might adopt roles in eye pigment transport in daphnia appears a reasonable hypothesis. however, it is noteworthy that recent evidence in drosophila suggests additional neurobiological functions for the white protein  <cit> .

abch
the abch subfamily is lacking members in mammals and c. elegans, and has been identified for the first time in drosophila  <cit> . at present, teleost fish are the only vertebrates known to possess abch transporters  <cit> . abch proteins are inverse half-transporters showing the same domain architecture as the members of the abcg subfamily. the function of abch proteins is yet unknown. in daphnia, this subfamily is with  <dig> members the second largest abc subfamily . the phylogenetic analysis assigned daphnia and drosophila proteins in distinct clades , suggesting that the diversity of abch subfamily in daphnia has arisen from lineage specific gene duplications. as observed with the abcg subfamily, clusters of neighbouring genes displaying high similarity are found among daphnia abch proteins .

CONCLUSIONS
the identification and phylogenetical analysis of abc transporters in the daphnia pulex genome, the first available crustacean genome, has revealed interesting traits of this important group of proteins in daphnia. the complement of abc proteins shows parallels between two arthropods daphnia and drosophila in that both lack homologues to the human proteins tap, protein translocators involved in antigen processing, and cftr, a chloride channel regulated by atp. the high conservation in daphnia of abc proteins involved in fundamental cellular processes, such as the mitochondrial abcb half transporters and the members of subfamilies abcd, abce and abcf, confirms an earlier study  <cit>  in strongly suggesting an evolutionary ancestral origin of these proteins. clear orthologous relationships were observed in further occasions, providing the basis for a tentative function assignment to daphnia homologues of sur, a membrane receptor regulating a potassium channel, and to daphnia homologues of the drosophila genes et <dig> and scarlet. the presence of proteins in daphnia that resemble the abc drug efflux transporters habcb1/mdr <dig> and habcc1/mrp <dig> is in accordance with the hypothesis that these daphnia proteins might adopt roles in the biochemical defence against toxicants; however, the lack of clear orthologous relationships makes the inference of function in these cases uncertain. a high number of duplicated genes was observed in the abcg and abch subfamilies of daphnia. this parallels the situation in drosophila and caenorhabditis, which also show lineage specific duplications, albeit in other subfamilies. more research is needed to unravel the physiological significance of gene duplications in daphnia.
