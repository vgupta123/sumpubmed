BACKGROUND
allorecognition is the ability of an organism to differentiate self or close relatives from unrelated individuals. examples of allorecognition include the self-incompatibility  systems in plants, vertebrate immune response to foreign antigens mediated by mhc loci, and fusion/rejection, where two genetically independent individuals physically join to become a single individual or reject each other. effective allorecognition systems are critical to the survival of organisms: the si loci prevent inbreeding depression, t-lymphocytes educated by mhc molecules protect vertebrates against pathogens, and fusing to a closely related individual can provide competitive and reproductive advantages where space is limited and reproductive output is based on the size of the organism
 <cit> . allorecognition occurs across the tree of life
 <cit> , in anemones
 <cit> , angiosperms
 <cit> , ascidians
 <cit> , bacteria
 <cit> , bryozoans
 <cit> , cellular slime molds
 <cit> , corals
 <cit> , fungi
 <cit> , hydroids
 <cit> , gymnosperms
 <cit> , plasmodial slime molds
 <cit> , red algae
 <cit> , sponges
 <cit> , and vertebrates
 <cit> .

despite the prevalence and importance of allorecognition systems, the genetic basis of allorecognition has rarely been characterized outside the well-known mhc in vertebrates and si in plants. the genes responsible for allorecognition have recently been identified in a handful of systems: a bacterium
 <cit> , a colonial ascidian
 <cit> , a cellular slime mold
 <cit> , fungi
 <cit> , a hydroid
 <cit> , and a solitary ascidian
 <cit> . only in the ascidian systems have we identified putative receptor-ligand pairs
 <cit> ; ligands bind to receptors on the cell surface.

in the colonial ascidian botryllus schlosseri, allorecognition occurs when terminal projections of an extracorporeal vasculature, called ampullae, come into contact between juxtaposed colonies. if colonies are compatible, the ampullae will fuse, forming a parabiosis between the two colonies. if they are incompatible, the ampullae will undergo a rejection reaction which prevents vascular fusion. the polymorphisms of a gene called fuhc  determine 100% of histocompatibility outcomes between interacting colonies: fusion occurs if the colonies share  <dig> or more fuhc alleles .

another polymorphic locus, called fester, is encoded ~ <dig> kb from the fuhc; fuhc and fester are tightly linked
 <cit> . fester appears to encode a cell-surface receptor involved in multiple aspects of histocompatibility in b. schlosseri. from a genetic standpoint, fester displays a characteristic reminiscent of all immune genes – diversity.

fester achieves diversity through several mechanisms. first, the locus is highly polymorphic, and encodes over  <dig> protein alleles, although these polymorphisms do not contribute to histocompatibility outcomes
 <cit> . because fester is likely a receptor of the ligand fuhc
 <cit> , these polymorphisms can tell us how fester and fuhc interact at the molecular level to determine histocompatibility outcomes. specifically, regions of high polymorphism in fester could indicate domains that bind with fuhc, and vice versa.

second, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of fester coding sequences split them into  <dig> groups: a, b <dig>  b <dig>  and c
 <cit> . the a haplotype has a single copy of fester, while the b haplotype encodes  <dig> linked duplicates . at present, the composition of the c haplotype is unknown. there are no other fester genes anywhere else, based on our crossing data
 <cit> . we will use the term haplotype to refer to the a, b1/b <dig> and c haplotypes in this article. figure
 <dig> provides a visual representation of these haplotypes.

finally, the fester locus is diversified in each colony via alternative splicing
 <cit> . the fester locus is encoded in  <dig> exons,  <dig> of which can be alternatively spliced in all combinations, making a total of  <dig> potential splice variants. each colony examined expresses a full-length fester mrna,  <dig> common alternative splice variants, as well as a unique repertoire of 8– <dig> different alternative splice variants; exons  <dig> and  <dig> are very commonly spliced out
 <cit> . exons 1– <dig> correspond to the extracellular domain of the protein, and exons 8– <dig> to  <dig> predicted transmembrane domains
 <cit> . in the present data set, the pcr primers always amplified all  <dig> exons. however, the full-length cdna was rarely incorporated into the bacterial vector; the longest amplicons recovered from the cloning process were almost always missing exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

functionally,  <dig> experiments support a role of the fester protein in histocompatibility. a monoclonal antibody  experiment, whereby the histocompatibility reaction is interrupted by a mab that binds to and activates the fester protein, resulted in a rejection being converted to a fusion. this conversion only occurred in pairings involving fester genotypes that expressed the fester allele that binds to the mab
 <cit> . fester could therefore be a receptor which binds to fuhc, blocking an ongoing rejection reaction and initiating the fusion event
 <cit> . in contrast, a sirna experiment, in which the expression of the fester protein is blocked, turned both fusion and rejection phenotypes into no response phenotypes, and ampullae were inert
 <cit> . this result suggests that fester also plays a role in initiating the rejection reaction. given this dual role, if fester is not expressed, no histocompatibility reaction occurs: a rejection reaction cannot occur because it is not initiated, and a fusion cannot occur because no receptors can detect the fuhc.

we know very little about the evolution of allorecognition loci outside mhc and si, but we have several reasons to hypothesize that loci like fester may be evolving non-neutrally. first, abundant evidence exists for selection acting on both ligands and receptors directly involved in mhc  and si . second, fester is highly polymorphic
 <cit> ; a neutral model of evolution is unlikely to explain allelic diversity found in fester and other allorecognition loci
 <cit> .

we will use three approaches to infer whether fester is experiencing selection or genetic drift: distribution of polymorphism within and among populations , polymorphism statistics, and ω statistics. amova and fst values for fester alleles will be compared to housekeeping genes. if the fester alleles are outliers with respect to the housekeeping loci, this will be taken as evidence for selection. polymorphism statistics  look for evidence of selection using a genealogical framework; values significantly different from zero are evidence for selection. the ω statistic calculates the posterior probability that particular codons are experiencing selection.

if selection is acting on fester, we will examine the support for three types of selection: balancing, directional, and purifying. using amova and fst statistics, a low amount of polymorphism within populations compared to housekeeping genes is consistent with directional selection; the opposite pattern is consistent with balancing selection
 <cit> . polymorphism statistics  are less than zero when purifying or directional selection is operating, and greater than zero when balancing selection is operating
 <cit> . an ω value greater than  <dig> supports directional or balancing selection, and less than  <dig> supports purifying selection
 <cit> . in the few cases where allorecognition loci have been studied in an evolutionary framework, balancing selection is more prevalent than purifying or directional selection
 <cit> . if we find that fester alleles evolve under selection, we therefore expect to find evidence for balancing selection.

RESULTS
sampling
colonies were collected from floating docks in each of  <dig> populations in  <dig> and 2010: falmouth, ma, quissett, ma, sandwich, ma, monterey, ca, santa barbara, ca and seattle, wa. falmouth, ma and quissett, ma are  <dig> miles apart, on vineyard sound and buzzards bay, respectively. sandwich, ma is  <dig> miles from the falmouth/quissett area, on cape cod bay. santa barbara, ca is  <dig> miles south of monterey, ca and  <dig>  miles south of seattle, wa.

relationships among fester haplotypes
we constructed phylogenetic trees to evaluate the evolutionary relationships between the fester haplotypes. ml and bayesian methods show the a-type alleles, the b1/b2-type alleles and the c-type alleles to be monophyletic groups . in all analyses, the  <dig> b2-type alleles group together, but b <dig> is paraphyletic with respect to b <dig>  the b <dig> clade has strong support .

comparison of variation among fester allele types
we compared variation and diversity among fester allele types to inform our understanding of the evolution of these allele types. significantly more variation exists in the a clade than in either b1/b <dig> or c. dxy/da values quantify this disparity: a clade vs. b1/b <dig> clade =  <dig> / <dig> , a clade vs. c clade =  <dig> / <dig> , b1/b <dig> clade vs. c clade =  <dig> / <dig> . because da corrects for within-allele type variation, the higher variation in the a-type alleles is not an artifact of more colonies having a-type alleles than b1/b <dig> or c-type alleles.

when a-type alleles are compared between east coast and west coast, several measures of diversity  are larger for the east coast group than for the west coast group . we sampled  <dig> colonies with a-type alleles from the east coast, and  <dig> colonies with a-type alleles from the west coast.

recombination
all populations  experience intragenic recombination.  <dig> and  <dig> minimum number of recombination events  are found in the a-type east and west coast groups, respectively. for a-type east coast, recombination is detected between sites  <dig>   and  <dig>  . for a-type west coast, recombination is detected between sites  <dig>  . significant negative correlations between physical distance and all  <dig> measures of ld for east coast a-type alleles, and for  <dig> measure of ld for west coast a-type alleles . the east coast b1-type and c-type alleles have  <dig> minimum recombination events, but significant negative correlations between physical distance and all  <dig> measures of ld are found in both groups .

selection inference: distribution of polymorphism within and among populations
fester
analyzing the distribution of fester polymorphism within and among populations and comparing these distributions to housekeeping genes allows us to make inferences about whether selection is occurring at fester alleles. amova, fixation indices , and pairwise fst values for all allele types are shown in additional file
 <dig>  the two groups are all east coast populations taken together, and all west coast populations taken together. for the a-type alleles, 96% of the variation is found within populations and there is no significant differentiation among groups, among populations within groups, or among populations among groups. only 1/ <dig> pairwise fst values is significant . qualitative results are identical for the b1-type and c-type alleles: 100% of the variation is found within  populations, neither global fst nor pairwise fst values are significant. clearly, fester variation is found exclusively within populations.

the allele types show some geographic signature. the a-type alleles, by far the most common , are found in similar numbers in east coast and west coast populations , but the b1-type and c-type allele types are rarely found on the west coast . only  <dig> b2-type alleles are present in our samples, and although they are both found in the monterey population, we cannot conclude anything about the geographic structuring of this allele type with so few samples.

housekeeping genes
the housekeeping genes are as follows: mitochondrial coi, 40s ribosomal protein 3a, 60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  adult-type muscle actin  <dig>  heat shock cognate 71kda protein, cytoplasmic actin  <dig>  adp/atp translocase  <dig>  heat shock protein hsp- <dig> beta, vasa, and vigilin. the housekeeping genes show a pattern that contrasts with fester. all housekeeping loci have a substantially lower percentage of the variation within populations than fester . all loci have a substantially higher percentage of the variation among groups than fester although fct is not significant for any locus . all loci have a substantially higher percentage of the variation among populations within groups than fester, and fsc is significant for all loci but  <dig> . significant differentiation exists among populations among groups: overall fst is significant for all loci, and a majority of pairwise fst values are significant.
 <dig>  the bars from left to right correspond to the following genes: fester b1-type, fester c-type, fester a-type, cytoplasmic actin  <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  mitochondrial coi, 60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  40s ribosomal protein 3a, adp/atp translocase  <dig>  adult-type muscle actin  <dig>  vigilin, heat shock cognate  <dig> kda protein, heat shock protein hsp- <dig> beta, and vasa.

tests of selection: polymorphism statistics
fester
table
 <dig> shows θ and π for each allele type. for the a-type alleles, east coast has higher levels of polymorphism than west coast. b1-type and c-type east coast groups have polymorphism values similar to those of the a-type west coast group.

table
 <dig> displays tajima's d values for a-type east and west coasts, and b1-type/c-type east coast. coalescent simulations given θ and segregating sites show similar p-values , so only results from the simulations given θ will be shown. a-type: d values are significantly negative for east coast only. b1-type and c type east coast d values are also negative, but are not statistically significant.

asterisks represent d, d* or f* values with associated p values that are less than  <dig> .

fu and li's d* and f* values are presented in table
 <dig>  coalescent simulations given θ and segregating sites show similar p-values , so only results from the simulations given θ will be shown. both a-type groups have significantly negative d* values, but only east coast has significantly negative f* values. just as in the tajima's d analyses, b1-type and c-type east coast d values are negative, but p values from the coalescent simulations are >  <dig>  in all cases.

housekeeping genes
summary statistics, shown in table
 <dig>  have consistently lower values for the housekeeping genes than for fester. values for tajima’s d, fu and li’s d* and f* can be found in additional file
 <dig>  we see very few significant values for the housekeeping loci. for mtcoi, two populations are significant for all three statistics. for 60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  one population is significant for all three statistics. for vasa, one population is significant for one statistic. none of the other housekeeping loci have populations with significant values for any of the three statistics.

we also noted that all d, d* and f* values across populations are negative for fester. for the housekeeping genes, only cytoplasmic actin  <dig> shows a pattern of consistent negative values across populations for the polymorphism statistics. 40s ribosomal protein 3a, 60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  60s ribosomal protein l <dig>  adp/atp translocase, hsp  <dig> beta and mtcoi show no trend towards positive or negative values across populations for any of the three statistics. 60s ribosomal protein l <dig> and adult-type muscle actin  <dig> are negative across populations for tajima’s d, but no pattern is seen in either d* or f*. heat shock cognate 71kda protein and vasa have no pattern for tajima’s d, but a majority of populations have positive values for d* and f*. 60s ribosomal protein l <dig> shows a pattern of positive values across populations for all three statistics.

to further compare housekeeping genes and fester, we calculated mean tajima's d, fu and li's d*, and fu and li's f* values  for housekeeping genes. we then compared these values to d, d* and f* for fester a-type east coast, a-type west coast, b1-type east coast, and c-type west coast . for all of the statistics, the fester values and the housekeeping gene values are non-overlapping. specifically, all of the fester values for each statistic are lower than all of the housekeeping gene values. this clearly shows that fester does not experience the same evolutionary forces as the rest of the genome.

tests of selection: ω statistics
the locations and number of all codons with >95% posterior probability of directional/balancing selection are shown in figure
 <dig>  exons 1– <dig> are predicted to correspond to extracellular domains of the fester protein, exons 8– <dig> to transmembrane domains. codons with <95% posterior probability of selection are not considered to be under directional/balancing selection. the majority of codons in the fester proteins have ω values <  <dig>  consistent with purifying selection.

discussion
tests of selection
selection is occurring at the fester locus
two sets of hypotheses have generally been advanced for the maintenance of polymorphism at allorecognition loci – those invoking neutral processes, and those invoking selective processes . all three analytical methods we employed  provide evidence that selection is occurring at the fester locus.

nearly all of the variation in the fester locus resides within populations, just as with fuhc
 <cit> . the housekeeping genes have substantially more structure among populations within groups and among groups than fester . in addition, a majority of the pairwise fst values are significant for the housekeeping genes, but only one is significant in fester a-type, and none in b1-type or c-type. the east coast exhibits more differentiation between populations than the west coast:  <dig> intra-east coast population pairs show differentiation whereas  <dig> intra-west coast population pairs do . this variation in amount of differentiation may be due to the wider geographical sampling on the west coast. however, any bias in amova results due to higher differentiation on the west coast than on the east coast would affect both fester and housekeeping genes.

the population differentiation at the housekeeping loci confirms the significant genetic structure seen for neutral markers  in b. schlosseri <cit> . these results are in sharp contrast to the lack of significant population differentiation at fester and fuhc.

the pattern seen here is consistent with balancing selection acting on fester. loci experiencing balancing selection  should have larger amounts of polymorphism within populations and smaller amounts among populations than neutral loci , whereas the opposite pattern is expected for loci experiencing directional selection
 <cit> .

all polymorphism statistics  are significantly negative for the east coast a-type alleles, and fu and li's f* statistic is significantly negative for the west coast a-type alleles, consistent with either purifying selection or a recent selective sweep at this haplotype . these results are likely due to selection rather than demography, given that  <dig> of the housekeeping loci have no populations that were significant for any of the polymorphism statistics. the remaining three loci only have 1– <dig> populations  that were significant for one or more of the statistics. in addition, the housekeeping loci do not show a consistent negative trend of polymorphism statistics across all populations, as fester does. figures
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> provide additional conformation that values of polymorphism statistics are more negative for fester than for housekeeping genes.

polymorphism statistics for b1-type and c-type alleles are always negative, but are not statistically different from zero. we cannot therefore reject the null hypothesis that the b1-type and c-type alleles are evolving neutrally, based on these statistics. however, fester b1-type and c-type are clearly on a different evolutionary trajectory than the rest of the b. schlosseri genome  and ω statistics provide evidence for selection on all  <dig> of the fester-allele types tested: a, b <dig> and c.

exons  <dig>  and  <dig> have statistically higher ω values than the rest of the gene for the a-type west coast group, the b1-type group, and the c-type group. the a-type east coast group also highlights exon  <dig> as significant, but not exon  <dig>  no putative conserved domains were detected when exons  <dig> and  <dig> were submitted as queries to the ncbi non-redundant protein sequences database using blastp. exon  <dig> encodes a short consensus repeat  domain often found in vertebrate complement receptors 
 <cit> . exon  <dig> is a functional transmembrane domain that was co-localized with cd <dig> to the cellular membrane
 <cit> . splice variants missing exons  <dig> and  <dig> are occasionally found, but exons  <dig> and  <dig> are present in all variants sequenced thus far
 <cit> . we will focus on these  <dig> exons in further studies of fester's role in the allorecognition reaction, especially its interactions with fuhc.

another gene encoded in the fuhc locus, uncle fester, represents a partial duplication of the fester locus, with the genomic region encoding exons 4– <dig> nearly identical to fester's exons 6– <dig>  but uncle fester's exons 1– <dig> do not appear to be related to any fester sequence
 <cit> . this protein plays a role in initiating the rejection response between incompatible individuals, but is not involved in the fusion response
 <cit> . uncle fester, like fester, likely acts a receptor to the fuhc ligand. two of the fester exons that have statistically higher ω values than the rest of the fester gene  are not related to the uncle fester sequence. fester's exon  <dig> is very similar to uncle fester's exon  <dig>  and has higher ω values than the rest of the fester gene.

type of selection occurring at the fester locus
these data do not provide unambiguous support for a specific type of selection. the polymorphism statistics are consistent with either purifying selection or directional selection. the ω statistics show that the majority of the protein is experiencing purifying selection , but that 15– <dig> codons are undergoing selection. the selection detected by ω statistics could be either balancing or directional; ω >  <dig> is compatible with either scenario. the distribution of variation within and among populations points towards balancing selection and away from directional selection.

the genetic basis of allorecognition has only been characterized in b. schlosseri, although the majority of botryllid species exhibit allorecognition. identification and amplification of fester in other botryllids could allow us to discriminate between balancing and directional selection. first, we could determine if trans-species polymorphism is occurring. in several classic allorecognition systems, alleles from species a are more closely related to alleles in species b than they are to other alleles in species a . such a pattern could be explained if alleles that pre-date speciation events have been maintained by balancing selection until the present time
 <cit> . second, divergence data would allow us to conduct several additional tests of selection  and apply other polymorphism statistics .

why might fester be evolving non-neutrally? if balancing selection is acting to maintain the allelic diversity at fester, what would be the mechanism of this selection? given fester's likely function as a receptor of the ligand fuhc, fester may be evolving in response to fuhc evolution. fusion can incur a significant fitness cost
 <cit> ; individuals with rare fuhc alleles will not fuse as often and may have higher fitness . fester alleles may evolve to bind with these rare fuhc alleles, and would therefore be subject to similar selective pressures as the fuhc alleles.

a recent study on the alr <dig> allorecognition gene in hydractinia comes to a similar 
CONCLUSIONS
 <cit> . they assert that alr <dig> polymorphism is maintained by balancing selection, with negative frequency dependent selection as the mechanism. hydractinia colonies also undergo fusion, and fusion can be costly for the losing genotype in situations where the two genotypes do not contribute equally to the next generation
 <cit> .

but if directional  selection is maintaining variation at fester, what would be the biological explanation for this pattern? fusion may also be beneficial to colonial ascidians such as b. schlosseri <cit> . high rates of fusion are seen in the field 
 <cit>  and the laboratory between unrelated individuals 
 <cit> , and half-siblings 
 <cit> . b. schlosseri juveniles also prefer to settle near related individuals
 <cit> . in a scenario where fusion is beneficial, individuals with common fester alleles  would have higher fitness, and these common alleles would go to fixation.

relationships among fester haplotypes
because b <dig> is paraphyletic with respect to b <dig>  the b <dig> copy may be derived from a duplication of the b <dig> copy. in our laboratory-reared strains in which the fester copies have been physically mapped, both b <dig> and b <dig> reside on a single haplotype, while the a haplotype has a single copy
 <cit> . this is consistent with a duplication event creating the second b copy. duplication events often drive genomic diversity in vertebrate mhc receptors including ly <dig> genes in murines
 <cit> , nkg <dig> genes in humans
 <cit> , and lemurs
 <cit> , kirs in humans
 <cit> , and heavy chain variable segment  genes in humans
 <cit> . however, more b <dig> alleles need to be sequenced before hypotheses about the origins of the b <dig> copy can be tested.

the a clade is equally divergent from both the b1/b <dig> and c clades, which are less divergent from each other than either is from the a clade. this pattern is consistent with at least  <dig> evolutionary scenarios: 1) the a haplotype experienced a duplication event which gave rise to the ancestor of the b1/b <dig> and c haplotypes, or 2) a duplication at either b <dig> or b <dig> that gave rise to the c haplotype . either way, a-type alleles are nearly evenly distributed between east coast and west coast populations , whereas b1-type and c-type alleles are mostly found in east coast populations . this pattern suggests that the a-type alleles are more widespread in b. schlosseri source populations than either the b1-type or c-type alleles . the a-type alleles may therefore occupy the basal position in the fester phylogeny. but until we can sequence the fester locus from other botryllus species, this remains speculation.

comparison of variation among fester allele types
the a-type alleles are more variable than either the b1-type or c-type alleles. while more a-type alleles  were sequenced than b1-type  or c-type  locus alleles, it is unlikely that sampling bias completely explains this pattern. we found  <dig> distinct a-type alleles and no such diversity was discovered in the b <dig>  b <dig> or c-type alleles. there are  <dig> possible explanations for this pattern: 1) stronger directional or balancing selection on the a haplotype, 2) the a haplotype is older than the other haplotypes and has accumulated more diversity through neutral or selective processes and/or 3) the lack of variation in the b1/b <dig> haplotype may be due to homogenization of variation due to unequal crossover or gene conversion between b <dig> and b <dig> 
 <cit> . the first hypothesis is supported by the results of the polymorphism statistics, which are consistent with the action of selection on the a-type alleles but not on the b1-type or c-type alleles. we cannot evaluate the second hypothesis without sequences from other botryllid species or more b. schlosseri populations. regarding the third hypothesis, concerted evolution has long been thought to play a role in the evolution of immunoglobulin genes
 <cit> . for example, this process has been suggested as a mechanism for the lack of variation in certain nkg <dig> genes in murines and humans
 <cit> . but concerted evolution cannot necessarily explain lower levels of variation at the fester c haplotype compared to the fester a haplotype, and the importance of concerted evolution by inter-locus gene conversion for the evolution of mhc and immunoglobulin genes has been challenged by the more recent birth-and-death model
 <cit> .

almost all measures of a-type allele diversity are higher in the east coast group than the west coast group. although we sampled a larger number of east coast than west coast colonies with a-type alleles , the distinct evolutionary histories of these two sets of populations may also play a role in the diversity disparity. east coast b. schlosseri lineage a came from the mediterranean sea, which is the center of diversity for this group of lineages collectively known as b. schlosseri <cit> . west coast b. schlosseri lineage a, on the other hand, came from the western pacific ocean
 <cit> . the western pacific ocean populations came originally from the mediterrean sea
 <cit> . east coast b. schlosseri may be more diverse than west coast b. schlosseri because native populations seeded the east coast and non-native populations seeded the west coast.
