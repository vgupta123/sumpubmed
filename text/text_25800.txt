BACKGROUND
the ophiostomatoid fungus grosmannia clavigera  is a fungal pathogen that discolours wood, and kills pine host trees by disrupting the flow of nutrients and water in phloem and sapwood  <cit> . in its ecosystem, g. clavigera is vectored between hosts by the mountain pine beetle . this pathogen can kill lodgepole pine  when manually inoculated under the bark at a high enough concentration  <cit> . like many bark beetle associated fungi, g. clavigera produces slimy spores that stick to the exoskeleton of the insects, but the fungus is also present in the beetle mycangia and alimentary canal  <cit> . during tree colonization, the beetles spread fungal spores throughout their galleries below the bark. the spores germinate and fungal hyphae colonize the phloem and sapwood of the tree. fungi benefit the beetles by improving the host environment for the beetle progeny, and serving as food for the larvae and the teneral adult beetles  <cit> . in addition, g. clavigera may counteract tree defenses that are activated during bark beetle attacks.

conifer trees respond to beetle attacks or fungal inoculation by releasing resin from pre-formed and inducible traumatic resin ducts, inducing the synthesis of phenolic compounds in phloem parenchyma cells, and forming a wound periderm tissue  <cit> . the main constituents of conifer resin are terpenoids, many of which have insecticidal and fungicidal properties  <cit> . ophiostomatoid fungi can decrease the concentration of terpenoids when inoculated on sapwood  <cit> . however, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in these processes are unknown. previously, we analyzed a small set of expressed sequence tags  from g. clavigera and found putative gene candidates that may be involved in terpenoid detoxification  <cit> . lodgepole pine also constitutively produces a variety of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids and tannins  <cit> . many of these chemicals inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens  <cit> . to detoxify phenolic plant defense compounds, fungi produce a variety of enzymes such as phenol oxidases that polymerize phenolics  <cit> , peroxidases that degrade polymeric phenolic structures  <cit> , and glucosidases and glucuronidases that are involved in metabolism of phenolic glycosides  <cit> . as well, fungi may release extracellular proteins that bind to toxic phenolics preventing their interaction with the fungal cell wall  <cit> . whether g. clavigera encodes and expresses genes necessary for detoxification of phenolic compounds has not been determined.

the recently published genome of g. clavigera is the first reference genome for an insect-vectored fungal tree pathogen  <cit> . the genome sequence provides a fundamental resource for identifying fungal genes important for symbiotic interactions with insect and tree hosts. ests support gene discovery and gene structure annotation. to cover a broad spectrum of expressed genes, we extended the previous collection of  <dig>  ests  <cit> , and sequenced the 5' and 3' ends of  <dig>  cdna clones from normalized and non-normalized cdna libraries of eight g. clavigera isolates grown in various conditions. we conducted a de novo est assembly and used the resulting set of unique transcripts  to verify the assembly of the g. clavigera genome  <cit> . as well, we used the genome sequence to address two problems associated with de novo cap <dig> est assembly: 1) incomplete assembly of ests from multiple transcripts of a given gene into a single contig due to incomplete splicing, splice variants, incomplete read overlap, and sequencing errors; and 2) incorrect assembly of ests from transcripts of different genes as a result of sequence similarity.

here we describe the g. clavigera unigene dataset, and discuss fungal genes upregulated in two biological states that are important for g. calvigera-mpb-pine interactions: the vectored non-germinating asexual spores, and mycelia treated with lodgepole pine phloem extract , which contains tree defense chemicals. furthermore, we show that overlap of neighboring genes on the genome was the major source for contig misassemblies in this de novo est assembly, and describe a simple method for identifying such cases even in absence of a sequenced genome.

RESULTS
 <dig> est analysis
to identify a broad spectrum of g. clavigera genes necessary for fungal growth we grew eight isolates  on five media, and for one medium we treated the mycelia with lppe . we also harvested spores from the reference isolate slkw <dig> that we had used to sequence the g. clavigera genome  <cit> . to maximize sequencing efficiency we pooled the media and lppe treatments, generating three isolate/treatment combinations with the reference isolate, and one isolate/treatment combination that contained the seven closely related g. clavigera isolates . furthermore, we prepared normalized cdna samples for three isolate/treatment combinations. we then constructed seven unidirectional, full-length enriched cdna libraries and sequenced a total of  <dig>  cdna clones from both 5' and 3' ends . after trimming vector and low quality sequences the average phred  <dig> read length was  <dig> bp. this resulted in  <dig>  high quality ests . after adding  <dig>  quality-filtered ests from previous analyses with the reference isolate  <cit> , we reverse-complemented 3' reads, removed polya tails, and discarded sequences with long mononucleotide stretches. the resulting dataset contained  <dig>  high quality ests.

all media were solidified with  <dig> % granulated agar. lppe = lodgepole pine methanol extract, ynb = yeast nitrogen base, php = potassium hydrogen phthalate

for the libraries ocl01-ocl <dig>  mycelial cultures from each of the eight isolates were grown on five different media, and for one medium the mycelia were treated with lppe . after extracting total rna separately from each of the  <dig> isolate/media/lppe-treatment variants and from the spore sample , equal amounts of total rna were pooled to obtain four isolate/treatment combinations. from these pooled samples we purified poly mrna and generated cdna. all three non-spore cdna samples were divided into two fractions, one of which was normalized. the resulting seven cdna samples were used for library construction. hq = high quality.

unigene assembly and unigene-locations on the genome
we assembled the  <dig>  ests into unigenes and determined their locations on the g. clavigera genome. assembly resulted in  <dig>  unigenes  that joined 91% of the  <dig>  5'-3' read pairs. most of the unigenes  mapped to the genome at high stringency , while  <dig> unigenes mapped with a quality below this threshold, and  <dig> unigenes did not align to the genome. we evaluated the contig assembly using two methods. first, we aligned the unassembled reads to the genome and tested whether all reads from a contig would map to the same genome location as the contig. for  <dig> contigs there was disagreement. manual inspection showed that  <dig> were correctly assembled and could be matched to an ncbi protein sequence, leaving  <dig>  potentially misassembled unigenes. second, we searched for contigs containing forward and reverse reads  despite unidirectional orientation of the assembled reads. we identified  <dig> such contigs, and in most cases found indications for transcript overlap between neighboring genes encoded on opposite genome strands. for all but  <dig>  fr contigs, the unassembled reads mapped to the same genome location as their respective contig aligning, however, to both strands of the genome. we manually inspected  <dig> fr contigs and found that for  <dig> of them the reverse assembled reads belonged to an adjacent gene model encoded on the opposite strand. for the remaining  <dig> fr contigs all reads mapped to the same region on the genome, but we found no evidence for a neighboring gene.

we generated  <dig>  unigene-locations  on the g. clavigera reference genome based on strand-specific unigene overlap and linking information from unassembled 5'-3' read pairs . of these,  <dig> uls  overlapped with another ul encoded on the opposite strand of the genome, with a  <dig> bp median overlap length. however, fr contig analysis suggested that ul overlap occurs more frequently. for the  <dig> uls with fr contigs, ul analysis identified  <dig> overlapping uls . manual inspection of genome locations with fr contigs indicated this fraction to be ~70% . this suggested that overall ~ <dig> g. clavigera uls overlapped.

genes represented in the unigene dataset
we predicted orfs for all but five of the  <dig>  unigenes;  <dig>  of these unigenes  were full length,  <dig>  were truncated at the 5' end, and  <dig> were truncated at the 3' end. seventy-three percent of the unigenes were similar to ncbi protein sequences . for these unigenes orf predictions were based on the best blast match, and we found that for  <dig>  of them the best predicted orf was not the longest orf. we also noted that only 8% of the correctly assembled unigenes had a significant protein match on the reverse strand, while 56% of the fr contigs had a significant hit on the minus frame. using interproscan and kaas, we assigned interpro ids, gene ontology terms, and k-numbers with corresponding brite classifications to  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes, respectively. the k-number annotated unigenes belonged to  <dig>  uls.

hierarchical classification of the unigenes using kegg-brite allowed mapping uls to pathways and infer higher-order functions . nearly half of the  <dig>  uls that were annotated with k-numbers encoded proteins from metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, as well as lipid and nucleotide metabolism. proteins encoded by  <dig> uls are potentially involved in genetic information processing . furthermore, we verified that this g. clavigera unigene collection covers essential metabolic pathways. using reciprocal blast analysis we identified all genes of the ergosterol pathway, all but one of the genes of the citrate and pentose phosphate cycles, and  <dig> of  <dig> genes necessary for primary amino acid biosynthesis.

 <dig> differential gene expression
we characterized gene expression in the g. clavigera reference isolate  by assessing est frequencies in the non-normalized cdna libraries from mycelial culture , spores , and cultures exposed to lppe treatment . transcripts for the majority of uls  appeared to be library specific,  <dig> uls  contained transcripts from two libraries, and only  <dig> uls  contained reads from all three libraries . to identify genes associated with processes that were overrepresented under any of the three conditions tested, we analyzed the set of library-specific uls that were annotated with k-numbers and assigned to kegg pathways . table  <dig> shows selected pathways for which numbers of specifically expressed genes differed between the three cdna libraries. among the uls expressed only in the mycelial culture library we found twice as many carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism genes than in the other libraries. spore-library specific uls encoded a higher variety of proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, nucleotide metabolism, and translation. in the lppe library, genes for signal transduction and n-glycan biosynthesis were specifically expressed. below we describe uls that were identified as differentially expressed by reciprocal comparison of read frequencies of the three non-normalized cdna libraries.

spores  vs mycelial culture 
of the  <dig>  uls with reads from the libraries ocl <dig> and/or ocl <dig>   <dig> uls had significantly  higher read frequencies in the spore than in the mycelial library . of these,  <dig> uls  encoded heat shock proteins  and other protein chaperones/folding catalysts . other uls that were overexpressed in spores matched proteins involved in energy metabolism and atp-dependent cellular processes: ca2+ transporting atpase , f-type h+-transporting atpase subunit epsilon , arsenite-transporting atpase , atp-dependent clp protease . for  <dig> uls read frequencies were significantly higher in the mycelial than in the spore libraries . a high fraction of uls that were overexpressed in mycelial culture encoded proteins important for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism: four glycolytic enzymes , a glucose transporter , a subtilase , and proteins involved in methionine  and melanin  biosynthesis.

lppe treatment  vs mycelial culture 
we identified eight uls  that were significantly  overexpressed in the lppe treated culture library . we analyzed the genomic neighborhoods of these eight uls and found that two uls  co-localized with other uls that were expressed only in the lppe treated libraries, and so may be functionally related. the first cluster  contained the steroid monoxygenase and uls encoding a beta-lactamase , an msf transporter, a cytochrome p <dig>  and a p <dig> reductase. rt-pcr confirmed that transcript abundance for all five of these clustered uls were increased in response to lppe treatment at the  <dig> h time point . reciprocal blast searches indicated that this cluster is not conserved in aspergillus spp., fusarium spp., magnaporthe grisea, and neurospora crassa. however, in aspergillus nidulans, the putative orthologues of the cytochrome p <dig>  and the p <dig> reductase  are located next to each other. the second cluster  contained the cupin domain protein and uls for an s <dig> family peptidase, an unknown protein, an aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase, a puta family dehydrogenase, and a short chain dehydrogenase. three uls of this cluster were specific to the lppe treatment libraries. this cluster was not conserved in the above fungal species. for  <dig> uls , read frequencies were significantly  lower in the lppe library than in the mycelial library . eight of these, including the uls for trehalase, scytalone dehydratase  <dig>  and hsp <dig> were also downregulated in the spore library. analysis of the genomic regions flanking these uls did not indicate clustering of functionally related genes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
ests can be assembled de novo, or, when a high-quality reference genome sequence is available, by mapping sequence reads to the genome and assembling them by genome location. we conducted a de novo est assembly to assess the quality of the g. clavigera genome sequence  <cit> . for this, we applied cap <dig>  a widely used est assembly program that is a component of recent assembly pipelines  <cit> . of the  <dig>  unigenes, 97% mapped to the genome at high stringency . only  <dig> % of the unigenes contained reads from distant genome locations, indicating either unigene or genome misassemblies. these results show that both the assembled genome sequence and the unigene assembly were of high quality. the unigene collection derived from  <dig>  high quality ests allowed identification of  <dig>  uls. in a separate analysis of the g. clavigera genome sequence we estimated ~ <dig>  genes . based on this number the unigene set represents ~70% of the g. clavigera genes. unigene annotation showed that our dataset covers in depth major metabolic pathways for general and essential processes, and provides sequence information on genes that may be unique to g. clavigera. these data will be a useful resource for future research on this pathogen, in particular for its symbiotic association with mountain pine beetle and interaction with the chemical defenses of host trees.

antisense transcripts may be involved in controlling gene expression  <cit> . we estimated that ~19% of g. clavigera uls overlap with another ul from the opposite genome strand, and so potentially represent antisense transcripts. our analysis indicated, that in most cases contigs containing forward and reverse assembled reads despite unidirectional read orientation  were assemblies of transcripts from overlapping genes. therefore, fr-filtering can help identify assembly problems as well as potential antisense transcripts in de novo assembled unigene collections.

control of spore germination may be an important factor in g. clavigera bark beetle symbiosis and tree pathogenicity. transcript analysis of the spore library indicated that early germination processes may have been induced in our spore samples. we identified several protein chaperones, including two hsp70s  and one cyclophillin d  that showed significant similarity to the a. nidulans proteins xp_ <dig>  xp_ <dig>  and xp_ <dig>  respectively. proteome analyses revealed that these proteins accumulated in a. nidulans within  <dig> to  <dig> minutes after conidia germination  <cit> . other uls with high transcript frequencies in spores of g. clavigera encoded proteins involved in energy metabolism and protein biosynthesis, which is consistent with respiration and protein biosynthesis activated early in germination  <cit> . the genes identified in this analysis may serve as markers for early spore germination. however, analysis of gene expression in resting and germinating g. clavigera spores requires further work.

genes whose transcripts were over-represented in response to lppe treatment suggested a fungal oxidative stress response caused by host phenolic or other defense compounds present in the phloem extract  <cit> . for example, we observed a large number of ests for cu/zn superoxide dismutase  in the lppe treatment library . sod catalyses the conversion of superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen. sod <dig> mutants of n. crassa are sensitive to superoxide-generating compounds and have a high rate of spontaneous mutations  <cit> . in contrast, deleting sod <dig> did not change the sensitivity of claviceps purpurea to paraquat and did not affect its pathogenicity  <cit> , indicating that other detoxifying systems may be involved. interestingly, our est data revealed a second cu/zn superoxide dismutase , which does not appear to be upregulated by lppe treatment, suggesting that the two sods may have different functions. similarly, a peroxidase  overexpressed in the lppe treatment library may participate in scavenging reactive oxygen species. alternatively, it may be involved in detoxification of phenolic compounds, as previous studies have shown that peroxidases can oxidize phenolic substrates and cleave aromatic ring structures  <cit> . est frequencies in the lppe treatment library were also high for a nitroreductase , but functions of this gene in host colonization are uncertain. bacterial nitroreductases can detoxify nitrosubstituted compounds  <cit> , including nitrophenols  <cit>  in reactions that produce superoxides and induce oxidative stress  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae two nitroreductases have been identified  <cit> , one of which appears to act in the lipid-signaling pathway. mutants for these enzymes showed extreme sensitivity to nitrosative substances and have reduced superoxide dismutase activity  <cit> . the authors hypothesized that the nitroreductases may modulate antioxidant enzymatic activities in yeast.

in filamentous fungi, functionally related genes and genes involved in niche adaptation can occur in clusters. for example, secondary metabolite genes in a. fumigatus  <cit>  and genes encoding secreted proteins in ustilago maydis  <cit>  are clustered. for g. clavigera, we identified two clusters of putatively functionally related genes that were upregulated after lppe treatment. the first cluster contained five genes: a steroid monooxygenase, a p <dig>  a p <dig> reductase, a beta lactamase, and an mfs transporter. the steroid monooxygenase and the p <dig> may participate in detoxification of lppe compounds by adding or altering functions of metabolites, similar for example to the p450s involved in fungal detoxification of pisatin  <cit> . the conserved co-localization of the p <dig> and the p <dig> reductase has been noted in aspergillus species  <cit>  and led to the hypothesis that this reductase may be specific for the co-localized p <dig>  the observed co-regulation of these two g. clavigera genes in response to lppe treatment is consistent with this hypothesis. whether the gene showing high similarity to beta lactamase is involved in ring cleavage of any lppe metabolite remains to be tested in future work. the second cluster contained an extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase and two oxidoreductases, and may be involved in degrading aromatic compounds such as phenolics. further analyses on genes in these two clusters are necessary to confirm functions and relationships.
