BACKGROUND
bordetellae are gram negative bacterial respiratory pathogens. bordetella pertussis and bordetella parapertussishu, the causative agents of whooping cough, are human-adapted variants of bordetella bronchiseptica, which naturally infects a broad range of mammals causing chronic and often asymptomatic infections  <cit> . the majority of gene expression in bordetella is regulated by a two-component sensory transduction system encoded by the bvg locus. the bvg locus comprises a histidine kinase sensor protein, bvgs, and a dna-binding response-regulator protein, bvga. in response to environmental cues, bvgas controls expression of a spectrum of phenotypic phases transitioning between a virulent  phase and a non-virulent  phase. during the virulent bvg+ phase, the bvgas system is fully active and many of the known virulence factors are expressed, such as filamentous hemagglutinin , pertactin, fimbriae, adenylate cyclase-hemolysin toxin, and dermonecrotic toxin , as well as a type iii secretion system  in b. bronchiseptica  <cit> . conversely, bvgas is inactive during the bvg- phase, resulting in the maximal expression of motility loci, virulence-repressed genes , genes required for the production of urease, and in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig>  a siderophore, alcaligin  <cit> . previous studies involving phase-locked and ectopic expression mutants demonstrated that the bvg+ phase promotes respiratory tract colonization by b. pertussis and b. bronchiseptica  <cit> , while the bvg- phase of b. bronchiseptica promotes survival under conditions of nutrient deprivation  <cit> .

the signals that activate bvgas in nature are unknown. however, in the laboratory, bvgas is active when the bacteria are grown at 37°c and inactive when grown at temperatures below ~26°c or in medium containing mgso <dig> or nicotinic acid at concentrations in the millimolar range. although originally identified as a positive regulator of virulence gene transcription  <cit> , it is now known that bvgas controls expression of over a hundred different genes whose products are either proven or predicted to participate in a wide variety of cellular activities including many basic physiological functions  <cit> . additionally, it is now understood that rather than functioning like an on/off switch, bvgas functions more like a "rheostat" capable of controlling gene expression of many phenotypic phases in response to subtle differences in environmental conditions  <cit> .

the advent of microarray technology has enabled scientists to investigate biological questions, such as those pertaining to bacterial pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions, in a global fashion. the cdna microarray represents a popular array type in which double-stranded pcr products are spotted onto glass slides. however, construction of such microarrays presents a number of challenges, largely related to costs associated with amplicon validation, tracking and maintenance. for example, the laborious and problematic tracking of pcr amplicons leads to an estimated 10–30% misidentification  <cit> . another limitation of cdna microarrays is their inability, due to cross-hybridization, to reliably discriminate expression patterns of homologous genes  <cit> . with oligonucleotide arrays, problems related to clone tracking, homologous gene discrimination, and failed pcr amplicons are avoided, thus making long-oligonucleotide microarrays a more cost- and management- efficient alternative to cdna microarrays. here we present the design and assembly of a long-oligonucleotide b. bronchiseptica gene-specific microarray using the currently available genomic sequence generated by the sanger institute  <cit>  and the software package arrayoligoselector  <cit> . this long-oligonucleotide microarray was then tested and validated by evaluating changes in the global expression profiles between b. bronchiseptica strain rb <dig> and its bvg- phase-locked derivative, rb <dig> 

RESULTS
to construct a b. bronchiseptica-specific whole genome microarray, the freely available software program, arrayoligoselector   <cit> , was used to generate 70-mer oligonucleotide probes for every orf in the bordetella bronchiseptica rb <dig> genome  <cit> . the rationale behind designing and utilizing oligonucleotide probes versus pcr amplicons as probes, and subsequently the 70-mer length of the oligonucleotide probes, was chosen for several reasons. long oligonucleotides are a highly sensitive alternative to pcr products and provide a means to readily distinguish between genes with high degrees of sequence similarity, which is an issue for the b. bronchiseptica genome  <cit> . for example, except for the extreme 5' and 3' termini, the fhab and fhas genes are nearly identical  <cit> . additionally, previous results involving an anchored set of oligonucleotides revealed a strong relationship between the oligonucleotide length and hybridization performance  <cit> .

for each b. bronchiseptica orf, the aos program optimizes the oligonucleotide selection on the basis of uniqueness in the genome, sequence complexity, lack of self-binding and gc content. candidate oligos closest to the 3' end of the gene are then chosen  <cit> . there are a number of missing array elements due to gene duplications, prophage duplications, and orf assignments missing from the completed genome annotation  <cit> . these missing array elements and, in the case of gene duplications, their corresponding represented array elements are listed in additional file 1- see supplementary table s <dig>  a list of the final  <dig> oligonucleotide array elements or probes representing the entire b. bronchiseptica genome is given in additional file 1- see supplementary table s <dig> 

to test the usefulness of the newly constructed long-oligonucleotide bordetella bronchiseptica microarray, a direct comparison between the transcriptional profile of b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> and rb <dig>  a b. bronchiseptica bvg- phase locked derivative of rb <dig>  was performed. the rationale behind performing this comparison to validate and test the b. bronchiseptica long-oligonucleotide microarray is that this comparison will globally identify b. bronchiseptica genes regulated by bvgas. previous studies, including cdna microarray studies, have identified  <dig> genes controlled by bvgas  <cit> , thus providing a substantial reportable reference set to validate gene expression data generated from the newly constructed b. bronchiseptica long-oligonucleotide microarray.

utilizing the b. bronchiseptica long-oligonucleotide microarray, ratio data collected from microarray analysis involving the direct comparison between b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> and rb <dig> revealed  <dig>  bvg-regulated genes . this is a substantial increase in the number of bvg-regulated transcripts compared to the  <dig> bvg-regulated genes recently reported by others using cdna microarray analysis  <cit> . a complete list of the fold-change expression values from this comparison, along with dye swap experimental data, is provided in additional file 1- supplementary table s <dig>  one possible effect of using the b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> strain grown at 37°c to represent the bvg+ phase, as opposed to using a bvg+ phase-locked strain, is that some bvg-activated genes could be missed in this analysis. possible explanations for the large increase in bvg-regulated transcripts detected in this study, compared to previous reports, may include  differences between strains used, for example wild-type versus phase-locked derivatives,  differences between gene expression threshold cut-off values used in analysis, and  for microarray studies, differences between array platforms, such as cdna microarrays versus oligonucleotide microarrays. gene expression profiles reported here of demonstrated bvg-regulated transcripts are consistent with previous results .

historically, numerous bvg-activated genes have been described, such as ttss genes, fimbrial genes, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, adenylate cyclase-hemolysin toxin, and dermonecrotic toxin  <cit> . using the newly constructed oligonucleotide b. bronchiseptica microarray, all of these transcripts were found to be positively regulated by bvgas . along with other virulence-related transcripts classically characterized as bvg-activated, three putative adhesion genes fhas , fhal , and bb <dig>  were found to be highly bvg-activated, as well as a putative novel toxin, bb <dig> , containing an aerolysin and pertussis toxin domain . seven atp-binding cassette  transporters were found to be bvg-activated, including bb <dig>  . in other bacteria, these transporters serve as important virulence factors based upon their role in nutrient uptake and in secretion of toxins and antimicrobial agents  <cit> . five autotransporters were highly bvg-activated, including two virulence-associated transcripts vag <dig> and sphb <dig> . the autotransporter sphb <dig> has been implicated in the maturation process of fha  <cit> . the bvg-activated expression profile of these transporters implicates their importance in pathogenesis. five genes involved in protein folding and ushering were highly bvg-activated. these include dsbg  and mucd , a degp family serine protease . homologues of both dsbg and mucd are known to serve roles in virulence in other organisms  <cit> . twenty-seven transcripts identified as serving roles in global regulatory functions were found to be bvg-activated, including the conventionally characterized bvgas and the ttss regulator brpl . other bvg-activated transcripts in this group include the other ttss regulators , three proposed two-component response regulatory proteins, and numerous proposed transcriptional regulators. lastly, bb <dig> , recently designated bopc and characterized as a novel type-iii secretion effector  <cit> , was found to be highly bvg-activated.

dna microarray analysis was used to measure mrna levels present in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> compared to mrna levels present in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig>  differences in mrna levels are listed as mean fold-changes ± standard error. fold-changes were calculated by averaging the data from three biological sample sets. arecently characterized  <cit> .

the overall global transcriptional program observed during the bvg- phase supports previous data implicating a crucial role for the bvg-phase in survival during environmental stress conditions  <cit> . genes annotated to serve global regulatory functions were one of the functional categories with the highest number of bvg-repressed transcripts. transcripts in this category include forty-nine transcription factors and/or dna-binding proteins, and ten two-component systems . numerous genes involved in transport were identified as bvg-repressed, including twenty-seven abc transporters and tonb-dependent receptors, such as bfrg bb <dig>  and bfea bb <dig>  . as mentioned earlier, these transporters serve important biological roles in other organisms, including participation in host-pathogen interactions as known virulence factors  <cit> . the bvg-repressed expression profile of these genes highlights nutrient scavenging as a critical ability during bvg- growth and supports prior data demonstrating that the bvg- phase is optimized for growth under nutrient limiting conditions  <cit> .

dna microarray analysis was used to measure mrna levels present in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> compared to mrna levels present in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig>  differences in mrna levels are listed as mean fold-changes ± standard error. fold-changes were calculated by averaging the data from three biological sample sets.

consistent with previous results, genes required for the expression of the siderophore alcaligin  <cit>  and urease  <cit>  were preferentially activated in the bvg- phase, along with a putative hemolysin bb <dig>  . also consistent with previous reports, all of the genes known to be involved in chemotaxis, such as ched  and chew , and motility, such as flgb  and flgc , were bvg-repressed  <cit>  . numerous genes involved in electron transport were bvg-repressed along with numerous genes involved in protein folding and ushering, including a high number of universal stress proteins, congruent with the bvg- phase role in stress survival  <cit>  .

bordetella pertussis only infects humans and, as mentioned above, is responsible for causing an acute upper-respiratory disease known as whooping cough or pertussis. due to its high degree of similarity to b. pertussis and its broad host range, including animals conveniently used in laboratory studies, b. bronchiseptica is widely used as a model for bordetella pathogenesis research. data arising from the recent completion of the comparative sequencing of three different bordetella strains has revealed a loss or inactivation of a large number of genes in b. pertussis  <cit> . thus an intriguing question is how many of the b. bronchiseptica bvg-regulated genes are intact in b. pertussis. to determine this, the orf sequence and oligonucleotide probe sequence for every bvg-regulated gene identified in this study was used to blast the b. pertussis genome sequence. this analysis resulted in identifying  <dig> shared genes that are bvg-regulated in b. bronchiseptica .

real-time quantitative pcr was performed to provide an independent assessment of microarray expression measurements for selected genes. genes were chosen to reflect the full spectrum of fold-changes identified by microarray analysis. specifically, transcripts identified as having little to no change in gene expression by microarray analysis and selected for qrt-pcr include bb <dig> rpoa, bb <dig> dnaa, bb <dig>  and bb <dig> eno . bvg-activated genes identified by microarray analysis and selected for qrt-pcr include the ttss regulatory genes, bb <dig> bcrh <dig> and bb <dig> bcrh <dig> . on the polar end of the bvg spectrum, genes identified as bvg-repressed and selected for qrt-pcr include bb <dig> and bb <dig>  a putative universal stress protein. additionally, bb <dig> rpoh, sigma- <dig>  identified as bvg-repressed  was also selected for qrt-pcr analysis since it had not been identified as bvg-regulated by previous cdna microarray studies  <cit> . real-time quantitative pcr analysis of this gene set provided data consistent with the quantitative measures by microarray analysis, using the newly constructed b. bronchiseptica oligonucleotide microarray  . therefore, this real-time quantitative pcr data provides independent verification of the microarray results.

quantitative real-time pcr analysis was used to measure mrna levels present in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> compared to mrna levels present in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig>  differences in mrna levels detected by both qrt-pcr and microarray are listed as mean fold-changes ± standard deviation. qrt-pcr fold-changes were calculated using the relative quantitative  method, as detailed in the methods, from three biological sample sets.

given that bvgas is the major virulence regulator in bordetella, the information presented in this report should allow researchers to design future experiments targeting some newly identified bvg-regulated genes and study their role in the pathogenesis of this organism. a recent study demonstrated that bordetella bronchiseptica, bordetella parapertussis and bordetella pertussis all contain a higher number of transcription factors or regulatory elements than the genome size of each strain would predict  <cit> . the microarray analysis presented here identifies, for the first time, an additional  <dig> predicted global regulator elements as being a part of the bvgas regulon, which could be described as a modulon. moreover, the data indicates that a high number of b. bronchiseptica regulators are under control, either directly or indirectly, of bvgas, thus highlighting an organized hierarchical network, with multiple layers of control, governing transcriptional regulation in b. bronchiseptica. distinct phenotypic changes occurring at each end of the bvg regulatory continuum have been described since  <dig>  <cit> . since then, the molecular basis underlying these morphological phases has been directly linked to the coordinate expression of the bvgas regulon. the results presented here provide a comprehensive, genome-wide portrait of transcripts encompassing the bvgas regulon, while also providing data validating the usefulness of utilizing the long-oligonucleotide microarray described here for studying gene expression in b. bronchiseptica.

CONCLUSIONS
long-oligonucleotide microarrays represent a highly sensitive, cost and management efficient, alternative to cdna microarrays. using the complete bordetella bronchiseptica genome sequence and arrayoligoselector software, a 70-mer oligonucleotide bordetella bronchiseptica microarray was designed and assembled. this long-oligonucleotide microarray was then tested and validated by comparing changes in the global expression profiles between bordetella bronchiseptica rb <dig> and its bvg- phase-locked derivative, rb <dig>  data from this microarray analysis revealed  <dig>  bvg-regulated genes, which dramatically increases the number of bvg-regulated transcripts identified to date. additionally, gene expression profiles of previously demonstrated bvg-regulated transcripts are consistent with previous results and quantitative real-time pcr data provided an independent verification of the microarray expression values. the results presented here provide a comprehensive, genome-wide portrait of transcripts encompassing the bvgas regulon, and provide data validating the use of the long-oligonucleotide microarray described here for studying gene expression in bordetella bronchiseptica.
