BACKGROUND
an effective immune defence is dependent on well-timed activation of an appropriate immune response. pathogen recognition by innate immunity pattern recognition receptors  is crucial in this process  <cit> . the prrs detect molecular structures named microbe-associated molecular patterns  that are conservatively present among individual microorganism taxa, because they are essential for their survival   <cit> . recent studies have associated polymorphism in genes encoding prrs with variability in resistance or susceptibility to several infectious diseases in humans, laboratory mice and poultry e.g.  <cit> . however, in wildlife, molecular variation in prr genes is still poorly documented  <cit> .

understanding the evolution of the immune system in general has been a challenge for evolutionary biologists and ecologists since jbs haldane associated natural selection with infectious diseases  <cit> . in vertebrates, the study of selection patterns was mostly oriented towards genes of acquired immunity which are now intensively studied even in wild populations. among them, genes of the major histocompatibility complex  are the most explored and the role of balancing selection in their evolution is generally accepted and well understood  <cit> . the quite late discovery of genes involved in the second branch of vertebrate immunity, i.e. innate immunity, among which the most important prrs are toll-like receptors   <cit> , has resulted in modest research of their evolution in wildlife populations  <cit> .

generally, two subclasses of tlrs are distinguished in vertebrates according to the ligands they target  <cit> . the first subclass includes tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  these tlrs predominantly detect bacterial components  and are expressed on the outer cell membrane. throughout this paper we term them “bacterial-sensing” tlrs. the second subclass includes tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> and targets mainly viral components , hereafter termed “viral-sensing” tlrs. these tlrs are expressed mostly within cells into the membranes of endosomal compartments. this current spectrum of genes for tlrs arose by multiple gene duplication and during the last  <dig> mya diversified to recognize distinct mamps  <cit> .

tlrs of both subclasses are transmembrane proteins composed of three domains  <cit> . the extra-cellular domain  consists of a varying number of leucin-rich repeat motifs  that form a horseshoe-shaped tertiary structure of the ecd. this domain contains the ligand binding region  which is directly responsible for physical interactions with the pathogen-derived structures and as such it is likely subject to intensive selection. the ecd is followed by a short transmembrane domain , and an intracellular domain  containing the toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain responsible for tlr signaling  <cit> . as previously shown  <cit> , non-synonymous snps located in lbr may affect the 3d structure of the protein and its surface charge. this may have important functional consequences, influencing receptor ability to bind pathogens  <cit> , and may even lead to the evolution of species-specific ligand recognition  <cit> . appropriate binding of mamps by lbr is connected with changes in receptor dimerization  <cit>  that induce signaling and release of cytokines triggering mainly th <dig> and th <dig> inflammation, fever and phagocytosis  <cit> . the tlr signaling ensures an immediate response to invading microorganisms that, in a second step, further directs the following adaptive immune response  <cit> .

previous studies, mostly based on investigation in humans, primates and domestic or laboratory animals, provided information regarding some general patterns of tlr evolution and maintenance of their genetic polymorphism  <cit> . these studies revealed that the ecd is more frequently a target of positive selection than the tir domain. moreover, in general the viral-sensing tlrs seem to evolve under stronger purifying selection than the bacterial-sensing ones  <cit> . however, up to now, the evidence of tlr polymorphism and the type of selection that shapes this polymorphism in natural populations remain rare  <cit> . besides, to our knowledge the precise investigation of the lbr variability and evolution is missing. such information could nevertheless be important to better understand species-specific differences in the susceptibility to various pathogens  <cit> .

in the present study we focused on the molecular variation of the genes encoding the bacterial-sensing tlr <dig>   <cit>  and the viral-sensing tlr <dig>   <cit>  in  <dig> species of the subfamily murinae. murine rodents are largely distributed over the world and several species  live in close proximity to humans. a recent review showed that 60% of the agents of emerging diseases in humans circulate in animals  <cit>  and most of the natural reservoirs of a number of serious viral and bacterial emerging agents of zoonoses are rodents  <cit> . species-specific molecular variability in immune-related genes may be responsible for differences in the ability of rodent species to transmit these pathogens. herein we aimed to document evolutionary histories of these two tlrs during murine diversification. we implemented statistical approaches to infer tlr phylogeny and to detect selection acting on dna and amino acid  sequences. we searched for deviations from “species” phylogeny based on a comparably sized non-immune sequence dataset by contrasting phylogenetic trees reconstructed from tlr sequences with those reconstructed from “neutral” genes . deviations would indicate the occurrence of non-neutral patterns during the tlr evolutionary history, e.g. adaptive selection  <cit> . next we estimated putative functional changes in the lbr by examining variability in predicted tertiary 3d-structures of the proteins, and in biophysical properties of proteins  at polymorphic binding sites. finally, we compared the evolutionary histories of the two tlrs to reveal potentially distinct evolutionary pressures shaping these proteins.

RESULTS
sequence analyses
amplification and sequencing were successful in  <dig> samples representing  <dig> rodent species for tlr <dig> and in  <dig> samples representing  <dig> species for tlr <dig> . only samples from one species - maxomys surifer could not be completely sequenced for tlr <dig> - the first  <dig> bp were missing and we excluded this species from the tlr <dig> analyses. no stop codons, indels nor recombination were detected in these data using sbp .

for the whole tlr <dig> coding sequence , the three different domains were predicted by smart as follows: ecd from aa position  <dig> to  <dig>  tm from position  <dig> to  <dig> and icd from position  <dig> to  <dig> in which the tir domain  and icd distal part  may be identified . for tlr <dig>  the predicted location of the three domains was the following: ecd from position  <dig> to  <dig>  tm from position  <dig> to  <dig> and icd from position  <dig> to  <dig> . in general, tlr <dig> was more diverse than tlr <dig>  and within each tlr, the ecd domain was more variable than the tir domain in both molecules . surprisingly, icd-dp located on the c-terminal end of tlr <dig> represented the most variable region of exon  <dig> .

phylogeny and co-divergence between the tree based on a comparably sized non-immune sequence dataset and tlr trees
both phylogenetic approaches  displayed similar trees for both tlrs . minor differences between ml and bayesian trees were found only at the intraspecific level. tlr <dig> topology was well-supported with posterior probabilities  ≥  <dig>  despite a lack of resolution within the black rat species complex , between two bandicota species  and between two subspecies of the house mouse . sequences of tlr <dig> were also predominantly clustered according to species with strong supports . relationships between asiatic mouse species were not fully resolved  as well as those between leopoldamys species . similarly to tlr <dig>  branching orders within the genus rattus were not resolved: rattus exulans  was retrieved monophyletic without ambiguity , r. norvegicus and r. nitidus were grouped together with the highest support  and the remaining rattus species formed a moderately supported group .

at the first glance, tlr phylogenies  of the black rat complex was congruent to the tree based on a comparably sized non-immune sequence dataset . the number of co-divergence events inferred using jane  <dig> was significantly higher than expected by chance, meaning that the two phylogenies were similar . however, the shimodaire-hasegawa test showed significant disagreement between the species tree and both tlrs phylogenies , indicating that neither of the tlr trees coincided precisely with the tree based on a comparably sized non-immune sequence dataset. the incongruence was mainly caused by recently diverged species of rattus. however, we revealed several other differences, such as the misplacement of the genus bandicota  and the different positions of r. sakeratensis and r. exulans in species and tlr <dig> trees .

evidence of signatures of selection
the comparison of ω  revealed substantial differences between the two tlrs, as well as between gene parts encoding different domains . the difference between gene parts was mainly due to variations in the number of non-synonymous substitutions , while they both had similar numbers of synonymous substitutions.

the highly conservative slac  analysis  <cit>  revealed two codon positions evolving under positive selection in tlr <dig> and only one in tlr <dig>  all of them being located within the ecd domain . we found  <dig> and  <dig> negatively selected sites for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> respectively , distributed evenly over the whole sequences.

the imprint of natural selection on protein coding gene is often difficult to reveal because selection is frequently episodic   <cit> . we therefore looked for evidence of episodic diversifying selection at individual sites along the evolutionary branches of the trees using the meme algorithm. thirteen codon positions were found to be affected by episodic selection for tlr <dig>  while only  <dig> codon positions showed this signature for tlr <dig> . in tlr <dig>   <dig> of these sites were located directly in lbr, while in tlr <dig> none of the sites evolving under positive selection were in lbr. whatever the tlr gene considered, all sites found to evolve under positive selection using the slac were identified also by the meme algorithm.

the signs of positive selection were scattered over whole tlr trees, affecting nearly all branches of the tlr <dig> phylogeny, both basal and terminal, while they mostly concerned the terminal branches for the tlr <dig> phylogeny . interestingly, one site evolving under positive selection  was located in the icd-dp of tlr <dig> gene . we found that this part  was highly variable  with a mean ω =  <dig> .

analysis of the ligand binding regions
in general, the ligand binding region  was much more variable in tlr <dig> than in tlr <dig> genes. we detected  <dig> different aa variants of the lbr in the tlr <dig> dataset, while only eight different aa variants were detected in tlr <dig>  out of the  <dig> aa sites of lbrtlr <dig>  43% were polymorphic, while among the  <dig> aa sites of lbrtlr <dig>  only 10% exhibited genetic variations. the consurf analysis performed to estimate the degree of evolutionary conservation of each amino acid position in lbr revealed 10% of phylogenetically variable positions  in tlr <dig>  but only 2%  in tlr <dig> . other positions were assigned as conservative  or had insufficient support .

ligand-binding positions in rodents were predicted by comparison with those identified in humans by park et al.  <cit> . in tlr <dig>  two out of eight lps-binding amino acid positions were identical to humans and strictly conserved among rodents . three other were conserved in terms of amino acid features  but distinct from human residue and variable among rodents . interestingly, one lps binding site that was uniform in human was found to be evolving under positive selection using the meme algorithm. we found hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, although this position, l442y, is known to be involved in hydrophobic interactions. finally, two remaining positions were found to be highly variable in rodents  . in tlr <dig>  the nine ligand binding residues predicted following wei et al.  <cit>  were strictly conserved within rodents and seven of them were common to both rodents and human tlr <dig> .

the pairwise rmsd that allowed estimating the differences in 3d protein structure among variants varied from  <dig> to  <dig> Å in tlr <dig> variants, and from  <dig>  to  <dig> Å in tlr <dig> variants . yet, in the phenetic diagram of tlr <dig>  3d-structures of rattus sakeratensis and rattus nitidus were distinct from each other and also from all other species. similarly for tlr <dig>  the 3d-structure of the protein of rattus exulans was separated from other species . to provide wider context we performed additional comparison between pdb structures  of human  and mouse  ecdtlr <dig> and between ecd of mouse tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> . the comparison between species of the same tlr was  <dig> Å . comparison between two tlrs from most distant tlr families of the same species was  <dig> Å . the analysis of electric charge of lbr revealed higher variation in tlr <dig>  when compared with tlr <dig> . detailed analyses of lbrtlr <dig> revealed that mus and rattus species were well differentiated from each other . similar pattern was found for lbrtlr <dig> .

discussion
in this study we analysed the variability of two important vertebrate immune genes involved in innate immunity across wild murine rodents and we looked for evidence of selection. overall, we found that tlr <dig> was much more variable than tlr <dig> and that the evolution of both genes had been influenced mostly by purifying selection. however, comparison of both tlrs revealed contrasting evolutionary patterns. tlr <dig>  which is involved in the recognition of viral nucleic acids, was highly conserved across rodents and its evolution seemed to be strongly shaped by purifying selection. predicted ligand binding sites in lbrtlr <dig> were identical across all species and only few sites were detected to evolve under positive selection within the whole molecule. by contrast, tlr <dig>  which detects several different pathogen ligands, was more variable and was affected by numerous events of episodic selection. positively selected sites mostly occurred in lbr, probably as a result of co-evolution with pathogens. analyses of the lbr variability in surface charge revealed a potential for interspecific differences in ligand binding capacities of both tlrs.

differences in tlrs evolution - phylogenetic approach
we found that both tlrs were conserved genes as their phylogeny almost correctly recapitulated species phylogeny. in spite of this conservatism we revealed some incongruence between gene and species topologies, especially in branches represented by the shallow genealogy of the black rat complex and bandicota spp. . these species have experienced recent and rapid radiation during the early pleistocene about  <dig> mya  <cit> . discrepancies between a gene genealogy and the species phylogeny in recently diverged species often results from incomplete lineage sorting  of ancestral polymorphism and/or episodic gene flow and hybridization  <cit> . indeed, r. tanezumi r <dig> and r. tanezumi r <dig> were recently proposed as conspecifics or were suspected to hybridize in southeast asia  <cit> . in addition, hybridization with introgression occurred between the invasive populations of r. tanezumi and r. rattus in the united states  <cit> . these phenomena could explain incongruence between tlrs and species trees. however, directional selection could also be involved. discrepancies in tlr <dig> phylogeny represented by r. exulans and r. sakeratensis seem more likely to be caused by pathogen selective pressure . ils and hybridization are unlikely to result in such deeper changes, whereas the influence of directional selection  on non-neutrally evolving genes could be at more likely explanation  <cit> . the rejection of co-divergence  between tlrs and species phylogenies could reflect the occurrence of pathogen-driven selection on tlrs during the evolutionary history of the murine rodents  <cit> . the former hypothesis should now be tested by a detailed analysis of spectrum of pathogens from rodents to determine if the species producing the incongruent topology displayed specific pathogens that could mediate this selection.

tlr variability and signatures of selection
we found that 92% and 100% sites  evolving under positive selection were located in the ecd, which is responsible for pathogen recognition. for tlr <dig> 92% of these positively selected sites found by meme algorithm were located in the lbr. this is in concordance with several recent studies conducted on primates, birds and rodents, that have suggested a high accumulation of positively selected sites at lbr  <cit> . surprisingly, none of the sites evolving under positive selection was identified directly in the lbr of tlr <dig> 

the tir domain of both tlrs was evolving under much stronger functional constraint than the ecd in both genes. we found only  <dig> amino acid variants of tirtlr <dig> in  <dig> species and six different variants of tirtlr <dig> in  <dig> species. altogether our results support the observation that tlr exodomains evolve more rapidly than the intracellular tir domain  <cit> . the requirement of sites within ecd, which would be involved in ligand recognition and able to recognize permanently fast-evolving pathogens, could explain this pattern. besides, the high conservation of the tir domain could be adapted to maintain a functional response of signal transduction see, e.g.  <cit> .

both genes showed non-significant differences between ecd and tir with respect to ds, supporting the hypothesis that there was no difference in mutation rate between ecd and tir. the same result has been found in comparative studies of  <dig> vertebrate tlrs  <cit> . the distal part of icd in tlr <dig> was surprisingly highly variable among rodent species. the reason for such a high level of variability is still unknown; however some authors suggest that this region at the carboxy-terminal end of tlr <dig> could be responsible for interspecific differences in lps sensitivity  <cit> .

positive selection we also detected using the meme approach that individually considers each codon along the tlrs phylogeny  <cit> . we found that episodic positive selection affected most lineages in the phylogenetic tree of tlr <dig>  while the situation was quite different in tlr <dig>  where the sites evolving under positive selection were mostly distributed only along the terminal branches. episodic diversifying selection could have affected tlr <dig> throughout its evolution and this process could still be in operating, while in tlr <dig> diversifying selection seemed to have appeared more recently and the gene history was mostly maintained by the stronger purifying selection .

analysis of the ligand binding region
in tlr <dig> variants we found  <dig> rapidly evolving positions distributed all over the lbr. while tlr <dig> is able to detect several ligands, the most studied one is lps of gram negative bacteria. tlr <dig> does not interact with lps alone directly but forms stable heterodimers with md- <dig>  <cit> . analysis of the crystallographic structure of mouse tlr4-md-2-ligand complex has shown that the interactions between tlr <dig>  -lps and md‒ <dig> take place on the concave surface of tlr <dig>  <cit> . we predicted that sites involved in the tlr4-md- <dig> interaction should be highly conserved to maintain the receptor function in lps binding and these sites were thus not identified in the present study. among the eight known lps-binding sites, identified by park et al.  <cit>  in humans, two residues  were conserved between humans and rodents as well as among rodents. these key residues are jointly involved also in hydrophobic interactions between tlr <dig> and md- <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that negative selection might maintain an invariable combination at these sites to preserve md- <dig> binding, which supports our hypothesis mentioned above. one exception was the controversial site l442y which was suggested by park et al.  <cit>  to be also involved in hydrophobic interactions between tlr <dig> and md- <dig>  but resman et al.  <cit>  challenged the importance of its function. among the studied rodents this codon was found to be polymorphic and has been shown to be affected by episodic positive selection during rodent evolution. a hydrophobic nonpolar residue  was commonly shared between rodent species except for maxomys surifer that harbored a hydrophobic and polar tyrosine . for three lps-binding sites, r263k, k360r and k434r, the biochemical features of the residue were maintained between rodents  but distinct amino acids were detected. the important role of these residues was supported also by ohto et al.  <cit>  and the potential functional importance of substitution r263k was beside confirmed by conservation analysis. finally, we have identified in tlr <dig> two ligand binding positions,  <dig> and  <dig>  with important amino acid substitutions that might be responsible for variability in lps binding. no signature of positive selection was detected for these sites; however functional importance of position  <dig> was supported by the consurf analysis. intriguingly, both residues form charge interactions with the same lipid a phosphate of the lps, which might indicate that the evolution of this position is associated with phosphate binding. however, this interpretation must be taken cautiously since resman et al.  <cit>  have questioned the role of the site  <dig>  in lps binding.

lbrtlr <dig> sequence was much shorter than lbrtlr <dig> one , which could be explained by the smaller size of lbrtlr <dig> ligand, the viral ssrna  <cit> . lbrtlr <dig> was highly conserved at the interspecific level. only two rapidly evolving positions  were detected and neither of them corresponded to the predicted ligand binding residues  <cit> . generally the conserved sites , have important evolutionary roles for example in protein-protein interactions  or in the preservation of protein structure .

we found that structural variation between rodent lbr of both tlrs  was comparable with the variation observed between ecdtlr <dig> of human and mouse . the 3d-protein structure modeling revealed that lbrtlr <dig> differed between rattus sakeratensis, r. nitidus and all other rodent species. the analysis of lbrtlr <dig> sequences did not reveal any specific or unique substitution that could be responsible for this clustering. the same analysis performed on lbrtlr <dig> revealed that rattus exulans substantially differed from other species. this difference could be explained by substitutions found at position h516y, one being specific of r. exulans  while other rattus and mus species harbored an h amino acid at this position. these inter-specific differences in lbr 3d structure were not related to the phylogenetic distance between species. they could be better explained by similar pathogen exposition and thus similar pathogen-mediated selection.

the results of charge analyses might be more important as they revealed interspecific variation in lbrs of both receptors. mus species had generally a more negative overall charge at lbr than rattus species . differences in protein charges were previously shown to be associated with differences in protein-ligand interactions  <cit> . likewise, differences between these two groups were also found in lbrtlr <dig> at positions that directly bind to lps. however, some caution is needed, since variation of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in sensitivity to lps or ssrna, respectively, between rats and mice has not been investigated.

differences in evolution of bacterial-sensing and viral-sensing tlrs
our results showed that the bacterial-sensing tlr <dig> was more variable than the viral-sensing tlr <dig>  and that tlr <dig> evolution was more intensively shaped by positive selection than in tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> had  <dig> % of codons under positive selection, while in tlr <dig> it was only  <dig> %. these differences are likely to be explained by tlrs’ specificity to different groups of mamps with which they co-evolved  <cit> . tlr <dig> detects more types of ligands   <cit>  and it seems that these pathogen structures have exerted more diversifying selective pressures on tlr <dig> than the viral ssrna affecting tlr <dig>  recent studies of parasites show that there is an important structural variability in mamps between bacterial species   <cit> . we propose that the ligand binding region of tlr <dig> detecting these mamps should reflect higher ligand variability observed in our data.

reduced genetic variability in important genes generally results from strong purifying selection acting against deleterious mutations in these genes  <cit> . it can result in a smaller effective population size and a lower amount of incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> . these two phenomena were found to be more pronounced when analysing tlr <dig> phylogeny. moreover the tlr <dig> gene is located on the x chromosome in mammals, which can be advantageous during evolution   <cit> . we suggest that the tension between diversifying and purifying selection, caused by adaptation to the variability of viral motifs detected by viral-sensing tlr <dig> and maintenance of function together played an important role in the distribution of tlr <dig> polymorphisms.

CONCLUSIONS
this study brings a unique insight into the natural variability and molecular history of two toll-like receptors in free-living populations of  <dig> murine species. purifying selection seems to be the dominant evolutionary force shaping tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> polymorphism. however, specific sites putatively evolving under diversifying selection were detected in both tlrs. these sites accumulated within tlr <dig> lbr, and detailed analyses revealed that several important amino-acid substitutions might alter lps binding. these substitutions were often species-specific and differentiated between the rattini and murini tribes. interspecific charge variability of lbr and to lesser extent the variability in 3d structure indicated the potential differences in protein-ligand interaction. by contrast, the evolution of tlr <dig> was strongly shaped by purifying selection. all predicted ligand binding residues in this receptor were uniform across all studied mammals to date. the contrasting evolutionary histories of these two tlrs are likely to result from different structural variability of ligands they target. since the crystallography of certain ligands   <cit>  remains unknown and the precise positions of corresponding binding sites are still missing, our data provide important avenues towards understanding which codons might be candidates for ligand binding residues.
