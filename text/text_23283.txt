BACKGROUND
the rna silencing pathway controls important biological processes in plants, including regulation of gene expression during development, heterochromatin formation, hormone signaling, metabolic processes, and stress responses, as well as being an important antiviral defense mechanism  <cit> . in plants, antiviral silencing can be triggered by the presence of viral double-stranded rnas , which are generated by the viral rna polymerase as an intermediate in genomic replication and transcription, or are predicted to form as secondary structures along single stranded viral genomic rna   <cit> . both structures are recognized by dicer-like  ribonucleases and are processed into virus-derived small interfering rnas  that vary in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides   <cit> . these vsrnas are then loaded into argonaute -containing complexes known as rna-induced silencing complexes , which promote the degradation of both genomic and subgenomic viral rnas  <cit> .

dcl ribonucleases are present in both monocot and dicot plants. arabidopsis thaliana contains four dcls   <cit> , while the populus and rice genomes encode five and six dcls, respectively  <cit> . the diversity associated with dicer ribonucleases, as well as other silencing-related proteins such as ago, strongly suggest that several silencing pathways have evolved in plants. correspondingly, in arabidopsis, at least six silencing pathways have been identified, and the four dcls involved are known to act hierarchically. for example, there are 21-nt vsrnas and other small rnas  associated with post-transcriptional silencing of endogenous genes generated by atdcl <dig>  in the absence of atdcl <dig>  22-nt vsrnas are produced by atdcl <dig>  and in the absence of both atdcl <dig> and atdcl <dig>  24-nt vsrnas are produced by atdcl <dig>  <cit> . thus, atdcl2- <dig> play essential roles in mediating the antiviral defenses of arabidopsis. in contrast, atdcl <dig> is mainly associated with the production of micrornas, which represent a class of important regulatory rnas derived from hairpin-like endogenous transcripts  <cit> .

all of the four dicer proteins expressed in arabidopsis are usually present in other plants, also  <cit>  . correspondingly, 21-, 22-, and 24-nt vsrnas have been detected in many plant hosts following infection  <cit> . however, based on the hierarchical roles of dcl <dig> and dcl <dig> in antiviral silencing, 21-nt vsrnas are by far the most abundant class of srna found in plants infected with rna or dna viruses, followed by 22-nt vsrnas  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the accumulation of vsrnas is affected by viral suppressors of gene silencing  <cit> .

suppressor proteins can directly bind vsrnas  <cit> , or inhibit key proteins of the gene-silencing pathway  <cit> . for example, the polerovirus p <dig> protein and the p <dig> protein from turnip crinkle virus  target ago <dig>  an important antiviral argonaute protein  <cit> . studies have shown that p <dig> preferentially targets ago <dig>  leading to its degradation, but does not affect the srna-risc complex  <cit> . a similar action has been suggested for the p <dig> protein, which binds to ago <dig> and may prevent the assembly of risc. however, unlike p <dig>  p <dig> does not affect the stability of ago <dig>  <cit> . by preventing the association of ago <dig> with risc, p <dig> has the potential to destabilize a complex homeostatic network involving ago <dig>  micrornas, and the four dicer proteins. this would be consistent with the preferential accumulation of 22-nt vsrnas observed following infection with tcv  <cit> .

in this study, vsrnas derived from cotton plants  infected with cotton leafroll dwarf virus   were deep-sequenced and characterized. clrdv is transmitted by the aphid, aphis gossypii, and is the causal agent of cotton blue disease  <cit> , which occurs in cotton crops world-wide. consistent with other members of the same family, clrdv is phloem-restricted and its genome consists of a single strand, positive sense, non-polyadenylated rna  containing six open reading frames   <cit> . this is the first report of vsrnas derived from a member of the family luteoviridae and the first report of vsrnas in cotton plants.

RESULTS
characterization of clrdv-derived srnas
to characterize the vsrnas produced during clrdv infection, srnas obtained from cotton-infected and uninfected plants were cloned and deep-sequenced using the illumina platform. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were sequenced from systemic leaves harvested at  <dig> dpi from infected and uninfected plants, respectively . reads ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt were mapped in sense and antisense orientations to the viral genome. only sequences showing no mismatches were regarded as clrdv vsrnas in the infected library. in total,  <dig>  viral-derived srna reads were identified, covering almost the entire sequence of the genome. in the uninfected library, only  <dig>  reads matched with the clrdv genome . of the vsrna reads identified in infected plants,  <dig>  were unique . equivalent amounts of sense and antisense vsrnas were found in the clrdv-infected cotton library, suggesting that vsrnas derived from the cleavage of dsrna are processed by dicer ribonucleases . to further characterize the vsrna library, the frequencies of redundant and unique clrdv-derived srnas ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt were analyzed . in both sets of analyses, 22-nt vsrnas were the most abundant. for example, 22-nt redundant vsrnas  represented  <dig> % of the total vsrnas sequenced, followed by 23-nt and 21-nt vsrnas . for the unique vsrnas , 22-nt represented  <dig> % of the total vsrnas sequenced, followed by 21-nt and 23-nt vsrnas . these data were confirmed through the deep sequencing, in an independent channel, of an additional cotton-infected rna sample , generating  <dig> , <dig> reads, of which  <dig>  matched with the clrdv genome. together, these results suggest that the cotton homologue of dcl <dig>  may be the predominant dicer ribonuclease involved in their biogenesis.

to determine whether the 22-nt reads are predominant only in the pool of vsrnas or whether this is the dominant class among small rnas of cotton, we compared the overall profile of small rnas between the infected and the uninfected libraries. in both libraries there was an abundance of the 24-nt class among the endogenous srnas, followed by the 21-nt class . however, in infected plants, there were decreased levels of the 24- and 21-nt classes  indicating that clrdv infection may decrease the production of endogenous srnas.

the high accumulation of the endogenous 24-nt srnas, followed by 21-nt srnas, are consistent with srna profiles in other plants . these findings indicate that the cotton rna silencing machinery responsible for biogenesis of endogenous or viral srnas does not tend to produce 22-nt sequences. therefore, the high levels of 22-nt clrdv-vsrna seem to be a result of the antiviral rna silencing mechanism or a specific clrdv-host interaction.

in arabidopsis, the 5- terminal nucleotide partially determines the preference of srnas for ago proteins. therefore, the distribution of 5- terminal nucleotides was determined for the sequenced vsrnas . for all three types of clrdv-vsrnas characterized , cytosine was the most commonly occurring nucleotide at the 5- terminus , while guanine was the least common . in contrast, 24-nt clrdv-vsrnas often had adenine at the 5- terminus , or guanine . for comparison, arabidopsis ago <dig> has a 5- nucleotide preference for uracil, ago <dig> and ago <dig> have a preference for adenine, and ago <dig> preferentially loads srnas with cytosine at the 5- terminus  <cit> . therefore, the results of the present study suggest that clrdv-vsrnas can be potentially loaded by multiple ago-containing complexes. however, 21- <dig> nt clrdv-virnas may be preferentially loaded by ago <dig>  while 24-nt clrdv-vsrnas would be loaded by ago  <dig> and/or ago <dig> 

distribution of vsrna abundance
to examine the spatial distribution and sequence diversity of the viral srnas identified, redundant  and unique  21- <dig> nt vsrna sequences were mapped to the clrdv genome. for both classes of sequences, the distribution of clrdv-vsrnas along the genome was non-uniform, with most of the vsrnas accumulating in the 3- region of the genome. this part of the genome encodes structural proteins and proteins that assemble subgenomic rnas during infection  <cit> . the greatest numbers of redundant reads were associated with position 5049- <dig>  with  <dig>  reads identified. overall, this region of the genome was highly represented. in addition, a large number of reads mapped to orf <dig>  a region encoding an aphid-transmission protein. however, after the unique vsrnas were aligned with the genome , there were regions associated with an absence of vsrna reads. when the same alignment was performed and up to two mismatches were allowed, only positions 4150- <dig> did not match with any vsrna reads . therefore, it is possible that this region may have a structural characteristic that makes it less accessible to dicer ribonucleases, although sequencing artifacts cannot be ruled out. furthermore, the hot-spots for vsrnas that were found to be associated with the 3- region of the clrdv genome might be generated by the massive accumulation of viral subgenomic rnas  observed in leaves  <cit> .

an analysis of the unique reads that mapped to the clrdv genome indicated that all dicer ribonucleases were able to access the entire viral genome. similar amounts of 21-24-nt vsrnas corresponding to sense and antisense strands of viral rna  were present in our library, reinforcing that virus-derived dsrnas are the main source of vsrnas. furthermore, peaks of both the abundance  and diversity  of 21- <dig> nt reads showed similar patterns of distribution along the genome. these results suggest that all dcl ribonucleases contribute to the generation of vsrnas with similar substrate affinities and target the same regions of the genome. however, the fact that the 22-nt class of vsrnas was the most prominent class supports the hypothesis that ghdcl <dig> may play a role in the generation of clrdv-vsrna.

expression of cotton dcl ribonucleases during infection
assays of tcv infection have detected a high abundance of 22-nt vsrnas  <cit>  associated with the silencing suppressor protein, p <dig>  during infection, p <dig> inactivates ago <dig> by down-regulating mir <dig>  as a result, low levels of mir <dig> directly and/or indirectly affect transcript levels of dcl <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether a similar mechanism might be activated in cotton-infected plants, we analyzed the expression levels of mature mir <dig> and dcls in clrdv-infected and uninfected plants.

in contrast with tcv infection of arabidopsis, qpcr experiments detected almost three-fold higher levels of gh-mir <dig> in infected versus uninfected cotton plants . furthermore, in silico analysis of mirnas in the deep-sequencing libraries from infected versus uninfected libraries showed similar results, with gh-mir <dig> levels slightly up-regulated during clrdv infection . the levels of mrnas for cotton dcls were assayed, and there were no significant differences in the levels of dcl <dig>  and dcl <dig>  transcripts  between uninfected and infected plants. in contrast, ghdcl <dig> was up-regulated during infection, while ghdcl <dig> was down-regulated . taken together, these results suggest that the high levels of 22-nt vsrnas produced in clrdv-infected plants may represent a mechanism distinct from that previously described for tcv infections.

discussion
this is the first report of the characterization of small rnas produced from a member of the genus polerovirus, family luteoviridae. the profile of vsrnas generated in cotton plants infected with clrdv revealed some interesting features regarding their biogenesis. for example, both sense and antisense orientations of clrdv-derived srnas accumulated to similar levels . however, several other studies have found that sense vsrnas accumulate to higher levels in some hosts  <cit> . in those cases, strand biases are usually attributed to preferential processing of highly structured single-stranded genomic viral rnas by dicer ribonucleases  <cit> . despite these differences and considerable experimental efforts, however, the existence of a direct correlation between vsrna hot-spots and structured regions of genomic viral rnas has never been proven  <cit> . the accumulation of equivalent amounts of sense and antisense clrdv-vsrnas observed in the present study supports the hypothesis that clrdv-dsrnas, which are generated by viral rna polymerases during genome replication or by the activity of host rna-dependent rna polymerases  <cit> , are the main substrates for dicer ribonucleases. since the p <dig> silencing suppressor protein from polerovirus was already shown to inhibit production of secondary vsrnas in 35s-promoter-driven agroinfiltration assays  <cit> , it may be speculated that the main substrate of cotton dcls during clrdv infection is probably the replicative intermediate forms of viral genomic rnas. however, the mechanism of p <dig> protein action in the formation of the secondary sirnas during virus infection remains unclear.

overall, the distribution profile of clrdv-vsrnas within the genome varied considerably. high vsrna densities were identified in regions coding for structural proteins, especially in the orf <dig> region . previously, it was shown that genes encoding structural proteins in the family luteoviridae are expressed from subgenomic rnas   <cit> . moreover, studies of the polerovirus, potato leafroll virus , also identified two sgrnas associated with the 3- block of the viral genome  <cit> . the transcription of sgrna <dig> provides for expression of orfs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  while that of sgrna <dig>  encodes two proteins located within the 3- proximal half of orf <dig>  since sgrnas are highly expressed during the infection cycle, an over-accumulation of vsrnas derived from this region of the genome might be due to a greater availability of dsrna intermediate templates for processing. accordingly, the hot-spot of vsrnas mapped to orf <dig> might be due to the expression of sgrna <dig>  which is also derived from this region of the genome. although the synthesis of sgrna <dig> by clrdv has not previously been reported, the acaaaa motif present at the 5- end of sgrna <dig> and sgrna <dig> from other poleroviruses  <cit>  is also present in the orf <dig> of clrdv  . based on these results, it is possible that sgrna <dig> is produced by clrdv.

depending on their length and 5- identity, srnas are selectively loaded into multiple ago complexes  <cit> . previous studies have shown that plant virus-specific srnas beginning with uracil or adenine are preferentially loaded into ago <dig>  ago <dig>  and ago <dig>  <cit> . in fact, ago <dig> and ago <dig> are required for the anti-viral silencing pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, 21- <dig> nt clrdv-vsrnas usually have a cytosine at the 5- terminal position , indicating that they may be loaded into a cotton homologue of ago <dig>  although the atago <dig> has no detectable anti-viral function against cucumber mosaic virus   <cit> , cmv-vsrnas have been detected in atago <dig> immunoprecipitates, indicating that the protein may act in the biogenesis of secondary vsrnas  <cit> . moreover, a predominance of 5- terminal cytosines has been observed for some viroid-derived srnas  <cit> . in contrast, most 24-nt clrdv-vsrnas have adenine at the 5- terminal , indicating that they can be loaded into cotton ago <dig> and ago <dig> homologues. in arabidopsis, the association between 24-nt srnas and ago <dig> has been well-characterized as a mediator of transcriptional silencing for transposons and repeated sequences  <cit> . in addition, the decreased number of vsrnas that start with guanine is correlated with the absence of ago proteins that might otherwise have an affinity for those srnas.

the balance between antiviral silencing and suppression mechanisms can directly influence the accumulation of vsrnas within infected plants. while the functions of the four dcl proteins present in arabidopsis are well characterized, dicer ribonucleases from other species, including cotton, remain largely unstudied. however, if the mechanism associated with dcl ribonucleases is conserved between cotton and arabidopsis, then the predominance of 22-nt vsrnas associated with clrdv infection would be hypothesized to be the result of ghdcl <dig> activity. although 22-nt cmv-vsrnas produced by atdcl <dig> are poor effectors of antiviral defense in arabidopsis  <cit> , other studies have detected a predominant population of 22-nt vsrnas following infection with certain plant viruses and viroids  <cit> . for example, cymbidium ring spot virus  and tcv infections are associated with an abundance of 22-nt vsrnas, which seem to be related to the activity of the suppressor proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . p <dig> can specifically sequester 21-nt duplex srnas  <cit> , while p <dig> can indirectly block atdcl <dig> activity by suppressing ago <dig> function  <cit> . during tcv infection in arabidopsis, atdcl <dig> levels are indirectly increased due to the p38-mediated down-regulation of micrornas, including mir <dig>  a negative regulator of atdcl <dig> transcripts  <cit> . since atdcl <dig> negatively regulates atdcl <dig> and atdcl <dig>  <cit> , over-accumulation of atdcl <dig> generates a deficit in the levels of atdcl <dig> and atdcl <dig>  leaving dsrnas more accessible to atdcl <dig>  <cit> . the polerovirus p <dig> suppressor protein is also able to destabilize ago <dig>  <cit> . although the activity of clrdv p <dig> has not yet been tested, the f-box-like domain necessary for silencing that is conserved among p <dig> sequences from other members of the genus is also conserved in clrdv . thus, clrdv p <dig> has the potential to similarly affect cotton dicer ribonucleases during the infection process. however, in this study, there were no significant changes in the levels of ghdcl <dig>  ghdcl <dig>  and ghdcl <dig> transcripts in infected plants . furthermore, ghdcl <dig> transcripts and gh-mir <dig> were up-regulated . the up-regulation of dcl <dig> has been observed in other viral infections  <cit> , but the levels of mature mir <dig> are inconsistent with what was observed during tcv infection  <cit> . it is possible that differences in tissue tropism between tcv and clrdv, and/or differences in the silencing machinery of the host, account for the observed differences between the two viruses.

members of the genus polerovirus are restricted to the phloem cells of their hosts. therefore, dcl activity in response to viral dsrna may be cell-type dependent. small rnas derived from hop stunt viroid  infections in cucumber plants showed different sizes in different tissues  <cit> . for example, most of the srnas from infected whole leaves were 21-nt long, while those derived from phloem-sap were more frequently  <dig> nt in length. although transgene-induced silencing in phloem cells of arabidopsis is triggered by atdcl <dig>  <cit> , a difference in the affinity or expression of dicer ribonucleases, or other silencing-related proteins such as dsrna-binding proteins in companion cells, could possibly explain the tissue-dependent shift in srna size.

the production of vsrnas following virus infection can vary depending on the host. for example, srnas derived from bamboo mosaic virus are mainly  <dig> nt in length in arabidopsis, but  <dig> nt in nicotiana benthamiana. therefore, these data suggest that dcl recruitment for vsrna production is a host-dependent process  <cit> . this is the first report of a srna profile for cotton virus-infected plants. further research is required to confirm whether the vsrna profile observed here results from a viral silencing suppressor protein, or from factors such as phloem-restriction or cotton-specific factors that can activate an anti-viral silencing pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first high-throughput sequencing of a member of the luteoviridae family, clrdv, from virus-infected cotton plants. this study shows that rna silencing systems against clrdv result in the production of 22-nt srnas as the predominant srna size class. all vsrnas, independently of the size, and that these are derived mainly from the 3- region of the viral genome. the sequence data of sense and antisense vsrnas strongly suggest that dsrna molecules are the main source of the vsrnas. during clrdv infection, we observed up-regulation of ghdcl <dig> and down-regulation of ghdcl <dig> transcripts, which are the major dcls in antiviral defense in the model plant arabidopsis. there is still much to learn about the molecular mechanisms underlying the prevalence of the 22-nt clrdv-vsrnas.
