BACKGROUND
gene therapy is being studied world-widely during the past  <dig> years. in almost all of experiments and clinical treatments, gene therapy requires delivering therapeutic gene into target cells to correct gene defects and achieve the purpose of treating diseases by using delivery carriers. people have never stopped pursuing more safe and efficient vector for gene delivery in gene therapy  <cit> . gene delivery vectors can be generally divided into viral and non-viral vectors. due to its high transfection efficiency, viruses were widely used before the potentially risk became serious  <cit> . the use of non-viral vectors may resolve some of the current problems associated with virus vector, such as safety risks. due to lack of immunogenicity and improved transfection efficiency, non-viral vector is believed to be superior to viral gene delivery  <cit> .

non-viral vectors are ordinarily cationic that can condense negatively charged dna into nano-complexes through electrostatic interaction. as a result, it can protect dna from nuclease digestion, and thus enhance the expression of functional gene within the target cells. therefore, various polycations were synthesized and have been investigated as gene carrier, including poly  <cit> , poly  <cit>  and poly   <cit> , polyethyleneimine  <cit> , and etc. in all of the non-viral gene vectors, polyethyleneimine was regarded as a potential candidate with considerable transfection efficiency  <cit> , but pei has high cytotoxicity and short duration of gene expression  <cit> . practically, transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity are almost antagonistic. pei with low molecular weight  shows lower cytotoxicity and lower transfection efficiency, whereas pei with high molecular weight  shows higher transfection efficiency and higher cytotoxicity  <cit> . a novel gene delivery system needs to balance the transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity. considerable attempts have been made to modify pei in order to improve the biocompatibility, targeting and gene transfection efficiency  <cit> . here we adopted the biodegradable and biocompatible pcfc to modify pei to increase the transfection efficiency and decrease the cytotoxicity of pei. pluronic have been confirmed to increase the in vitro transfection efficiency and enhance the transgene expression in vivo  <cit> . furthermore, due to grafting with pluronic, biocompatibility of the polymer might be improved similar to the mechanism of pegylation  <cit> . zhao et al.  <cit>  had reported cationic pcfc nanoparticles could condense dna and have potential application as gene carrier with low cytotoxicity.

in this study, a novel poly-pluronic-poly grafted polyethyleneimine copolymer  was synthesized and characterized. meanwhile, the dna condensation ability, protection ability, size and zeta potential of the pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes were detected. in addition, we observed considerable transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity of pcfc-g-pei compared with pei  <dig> kd.

RESULTS
synthesis of pcfc-g-pei
the aim of this study was to design and investigate an efficient non-viral gene carrier modified with pcfc. the pcfc-g-pei copolymer was prepared according to fig.  <dig> at three steps. at the first step of pcfc synthesis , we chosen pluronic  <dig> because it had satisfactory water-solubility; and the pcfc concentration in this copolymer had been optimized in prior research  <cit> . pcfc-g-pei was prepared from pei and pcfc, and the reaction scheme was shown in fig. 1-c.

the 1h-nmr spectrum of pcfc macromonomer was shown in fig. 2-a. the peaks at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ppm were attributed to protons of -ch <dig>  -chr-, and -ch2- in ppg unit of pluronic block, respectively. the sharp peak at  <dig>  ppm is attributed to methylene protons of -ch2ch2o- in peg unit of pluronic block. peaks at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  ppm, and  <dig>  ppm are assigned to methylene protons of -3-, -coch2-, and -ch2ooc- in pcl blocks, respectively. the very weak peaks at  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm are respectively attributed to methylene protons of -och2ch2- in peg end unit linked with pcl blocks. the signals at  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm corresponded to the protons of the double bonds and the signals at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ppm corresponded to the protons of pcl segment respectively. the signal at  <dig>  ppm corresponded to methylene proton of hoch2- end group of pcl-gma macromonomer. the 1h-nmr spectrum of pcfc-g-pei macromonomer was shown in fig. 2-b. chemical shifts at 2– <dig> ppm of the 1h-nmr spectrums are attributed to the protons of -nhch2ch2- of pei. the chemical shifts at 3– <dig> ppm are attributed to the protons of pluronic segment; the chemical shifts at 1– <dig> ppm and 4– <dig> ppm are attributed to the protons of pcl respectively. the molecular weight of the pcfc-g-pei was determined by sec in combination with multiple angle laser light scattering  . the absolute molecular weight was calculated by astra software. the mn of pcfc-g-pei was determined as  <dig>  ×  <dig>  whereas mw was  <dig>  ×  <dig> 

agarose gel electrophoresis
the capacity to condense negatively charged dna and protect dna against dnase i degradation is necessary requirement for gene carriers. in this study, we characterized these abilities of pcfc-g-pei by agarose gel electrophoresis. fig.  <dig> showed agarose gel electrophoresis of pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes at various n/p ratios, and naked dna was used as control. the n/p ratios of pcfc-g-pei/dna were  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, where the content of dna was kept at  <dig>  μg. as shown in fig. 4-a, in contrast to the naked plasmid dna, the migration of plasmid was completely blocked at the n/p ratio  <dig>  in fig. 4-b, the capability of protecting plasmid dna from dnase degradation was examined using dnase i as model enzyme. heparin was used as a strong negative reagent to destroy the pcfc-g-pei/dna complex and hence the plasmid dna could be released. after incubated with dnase i  in dnase/mg2+ digestion buffer at 37°c for  <dig> min, naked plasmid dna showed significant degradation, while the plasmid dna released from pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes  remained intact. according to fig. 4-a and fig. 4-b, we can conclude that the pcfc-g-pei copolymer can concentrate dna at low n/p ratio and protect dna from degradation by dnase-i.

size and zeta potential of the pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes
the size and zeta potential of the pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes are important factors for cell uptake  <cit> . many factors could affect the results such as the concentration of dna and polycations, the volumes of the complexes solution, the different sequences of addition of the reagents and also the speed of mixing. in this experiment, we chose deionized water as media when diluting and mixing pcfc-g-pei with dna, which was slightly different from some literatures  <cit> . according to table  <dig> and table  <dig>  we found that the complexes of pcfc-g-pei/dna and pei/dna showed significant differences in size: when n/p ratio was below  <dig>  the size of pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes was relatively stable around  <dig> nm, whereas the size of pei/dna complexes fluctuated from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm. with increase in n/p ratio to  <dig> later, both of these complexes shown strong fluctuation. however, pcfc-g-pei/dna and pei/dna complexes showed the same trend in zeta potential change. with increase in content of pcfc-g-pei, the zeta potential of pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes decreased until n/p ratio reached  <dig>  and then it rebound to  <dig>  mv. these results suggested that the dna condensation ability was strongly increased at higher n/p ratio, in addition, we found that the zeta potential of these complexes was greatly affected by many factors such as mixing time, mixing sequence, and etc. all results in this part were measured three times and revised.

atomic force microscopy
the surface morphology of the pfcf-g-pei/dna complexes was determined by atomic force microscopy. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the complex of pcfc-g-pei/dna was distributed uniformly and the spherical nanoparticles were around  <dig> nm in diameter at n/p ratio  <dig> 

in vitro transfection
the  <dig> t and a <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well in 6-well plates and maintained at 37°c with 5% co <dig> until the degrees of fusion reached 60%. each experiment used the same protocol and the concentration of plasmid dna was kept at  <dig> μg. after transient transfection and additional incubation for  <dig> h, transfection images were observed by fluorescence inverted microscope , and photographed by using spot flex , and transfection efficiency was quantitatively analyzed using flow cytometry . the highest transfection efficiency was observed in  <dig> t cell line which the efficiency reached  <dig> %, while in a <dig> the transfection efficiency was  <dig> % .

transfection efficiency depends on the charge ratio between pcfc-g-pei and dna. with optimizing n/p ratio, the transfection efficiency improved. in our work, the optimal n/p ratios of pcfc-g-pei/dna were  <dig> to  <dig>  while that of pei previously reported was  <dig> to  <dig> <cit> . the reason that pcfc-g-pei/dna had higher transfection efficiency at lower n/p ratio might be due to the high amine content because that pcfc-g-pei was cascade connection using pei  <dig> kd. there are less free elements when binding with dna in transfection experiment so that the toxicity of pcfc-g-pei will be reduced lower than that of pei as the n/p ratio increased by observation  <cit> . in addition, as a pluronic grafted copolymer, pluronic  <dig> was contained in the pcfc complex and could be degraded in acid, it had been reported that pluronic block copolymer exhibit valuable biological activities such as enhancing sealing of cell membranes permeated by ionizing radiation and electroporation thus preventing cellular necrosis  <cit> , and could also enhance polycation-mediated gene transfer in vitro  <cit> . due to these advantages, though the content of relative primary amine was decreased, the transfection efficiency did not decreased significantly according to our results.

cytotoxicity
the cytotoxicity caused by pcfc-g-pei  and pei  were assessed by mtt assay  and propidium iodide  staining and flow cytometry . mtt assay shows that complexes of pcfc-g-pei have lower cytotoxicity than that of pei  <dig> kd in two cell lines,  <dig> t and a <dig>  it is confirmed that the cyto-compatibility of pcfc-g-pei improved as compared with pei  <dig> kd. in both cell lines, the tolerance of the gene delivery vector had increased to a different degree. the  <dig> t cell line was the most sensitive that demonstrated the biggest difference on tolerance between pcfc-g-pei and pei  <dig> kd. at the concentration of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/ml, pcfc-g-pei did not show apparent cytotoxicity, while the survival rate of pei control group was approximately 40%. for the a <dig> cell line, both groups of pcfc-g-pei and pei showed higher tolerance than  <dig> t; and at the concentration of  <dig> μg/ml the cell viability of pcfc-g-pei were greater than 80%, while the cell viability of pei was just 70%. many reports had confirmed that high molecular weight pei with high gene transfection efficiency had higher significant cytotoxicity than low molecular weight pei  <cit> , but if complexes modified as pcfc, the cytotoxicity might decreased due to some reasons, such as the presence of biocompatible pluronic  <cit> , the decrease in free polymer concentration in cells  <cit> , and the decrease in charge of complexes with decrease in primary amine amount.

the flow cytometry of cellular apoptosis caused by pcfc-g-pei and pei also indicated that pcfc-g-pei have lower cytotoxicity than that of pei  <dig> kd.

of all the essays displayed, pcfc-g-pei complexes could be used in gene delivery system with lower toxicity and considerable efficacy.

many of reports had referred low molecular weight pei been modified have various advantages and optimization of the reasons behind: size matters, molecular weight, zeta or degradable. there are very few studies on high molecule weight pei modified or improved, due to the limitation in clinical application. however, as a comprehensive understanding of pei transfer factor, the part of the high molecular weight pei selected to conduct a feasibility study is necessary. and as a pluronic block copolymer, the advantage of pluronic may be used in improving the biocompatibility and enhancing the transfection efficiency in vitro. following this study, we plan to regulate the molecular weight of pei and the ratio between pcfc and pei, and look forward to finding a series of cationic polymers as gene delivery system in gene therapy as soon as possible, and in vivo study of such pcfc-g-pei copolymer will be studied in detail.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have synthesized a pluronic block copolymer pcfc-g-pei that crossed link with high weight molecular branched pei  by multiblock poly -pluronic-poly  . the aim of this study was to increase transfection efficiency and cell permeability by grafting pluronic with its biological activities. however, the transfection efficiency was not increased compared with bpei  <dig> kd. pcfc-g-pei effectively reduced toxicity on  <dig> t and a <dig>  and retained considerable transfection efficiency in vitro. the size and zeta potential of pcfc-g-pei/dna complexes suggested that transfection efficiency depend on many factors such as the molecular weight of the polycation and the structure and biological activity agent. the pluronic block of this cationic complex may be a very good reference on gene transferring both in vitro and in vivo.
