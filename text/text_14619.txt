BACKGROUND
lassa fever and marburg fever are acute viral hemorrhagic illnesses. lassa fever is caused by the lassa virus and it is endemic to a large region of west africa, where  <dig> - <dig>  cases have been estimated to occur each year  <cit> . more than  <dig> cases have been imported to the united states, canada, united kingdom and japan since  <dig>  when the disease was first recognized  <cit> . the case fatality rate in hospitalized patients has recently been reported to be 69%  <cit> . marburg fever is a viral hemorrhagic illness caused by the marburg virus. several outbreaks have been reported in the democratic republic of the congo  <cit>  and angola  <cit>  with case fatality rates approaching 90%. travelers visiting uganda have also imported the virus into the netherlands  <cit>  and the united states  <cit> . both diseases lack effective therapeutics and early diagnostics.

early clinical symptoms of infection are shared between different hemorrhagic fevers, and they resemble those of a flu-like illness: fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea and dry cough  <cit> . during the  <dig> west africa ebola outbreak, samples from suspected patients were routinely tested to rule out infection by lassa virus, since both pathogens were present in the region and distinguishing between them was an important part of the differential diagnosis  <cit> .

current diagnostic tests for lassa and marburg fevers include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  . because these methods rely on the direct detection of viral proteins or nucleic acids in the blood, they are not useful during the incubation period of the virus, which happens during the early stages of infection  <cit> . additionally, most potential therapies for these pathogens—ribavirin  <cit> , post-infection vaccination  <cit> , and stable nucleic acid-lipid particle  treatment  <cit> —work best when administered early. developing tests that diagnose these infections during the early stages of disease would positively impact survival.

one approach for developing more rapid diagnostics involves incorporating the host response to infection as part of the diagnostic assay. during an infection, circulating immune cells are present in high numbers and they respond to distress signals from many different tissues by altering the levels of expression of specific genes. these changes in expression often take place before the virus starts replicating in the blood   <cit>  , which means that they could be used to perform earlier diagnoses than those allowed by traditional methods. to ensure that the predictive power of these changes in expression can distinguish between different causative agents, the host gene expression profiles associated with each type of infection must be determined in advance. two recent reports have used a host response signature to discriminate symptomatic patients with viral infections from those infected with bacteria  <cit> . an rt-pcr assay has also been developed and clinically tested  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we have analyzed the transcriptome of pbmcs from non-human primates  exposed to lassa virus  <cit>  and to marburg virus , and we have found that the circulating immune cells develop a robust antiviral response days before clinical symptoms. in this article, we show that the expression differences in the genes that make up this response can be used to distinguish between lassa and marburg infections as early as 3 days after exposure.

RESULTS
clinical symptoms
animals were exposed to an aerosol dose of  <dig> plaque forming units of lassa  <cit>  or marburg virus , as previously described. in these models, animals began to develop a fever around day  <dig> after exposure to lassa virus and day  <dig> after exposure to marburg virus . the onset of viremia took place around day  <dig> for lassa and day  <dig> for marburg . the liver enzymes aspartate transaminase  and alanine transaminase  showed increased levels of concentration in both diseases around day  <dig>  d-dimers started to increase around day  <dig> for lassa and day  <dig> for marburg. in both types of infection, all of these markers peaked during the late stages of infection . these data confirmed that clinical markers of infection that could be used for diagnosis  did not appear in these models until day  <dig> post-infection.table  <dig>

viremia was measured using rt-pcr in the lassa group, and rt-pcr and plaque assay in the marburg group.



rna sequencing
to determine the transcriptional changes that take place in the circulating immune system in response to a hemorrhagic fever virus infection, we quantified the abundance of mrnas present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of cynomolgus macaques infected with either lassa or marburg virus. the samples were obtained before the animals were infected, and at multiple times after infection . we selected for polyadenylated transcripts and sequenced  <dig> rna samples from each group using illumina technology. this process generated an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million reads per sample; 72% of which  aligned to the m. mulatta  genome—the closest organism to m. fascicularis with an annotated genome. multiple factors may explain why 28% of reads remained unaligned: an incomplete assembly of the m. mulatta genome and transcriptome, genetic differences between m. mulatta and m. fascicularis, or the appearance of amplification artifacts during the sequencing process. we assessed the expression level of individual mrnas by counting the number of reads that aligned uniquely to each gene, and then normalizing this number to allow comparisons across all samples.

to determine the amount of sequencing reads that came from each virus, we aligned the reads to the lassa virus and marburg virus genomes. in the lassa infection group, only the samples taken 10 days post-infection  contained viral reads  . in the marburg infection group, around  <dig> viral reads were seen  <dig> dpi, and around  <dig>  reads  <dig> dpi . these numbers suggest that peripheral blood mononuclear cells are early targets for marburg virus but not for lassa virus. the number of viral reads found in pbmcs correlates well with the level of viremia, as previously reported for lassa virus  <cit>  and marburg virus .

the common transcriptional response of pbmcs during lassa and marburg infection is dominated by type i interferon-stimulated genes
to identify what transcriptional changes are shared by different hemorrhagic fever virus infections, we identified genes whose levels of expression 1) closely matched in both types of viral challenge, 2) strongly increased or decreased 3 days post-infection , and 3) increased or sustained this level of expression throughout the remaining time points . we labeled this group of genes the common response . some of its representative members include transcription factors irf <dig> and stat <dig>  which serve as master regulators of host immunity; pattern recognition receptors ddx <dig> , ifih <dig>  and dhx <dig> , which activate different signaling cascades in the innate immune system; type i interferon-stimulated genes isg <dig>  isg <dig>  oas <dig>  oas <dig>  oasl, mx <dig>  ifit <dig>  ifit <dig>  ifit <dig>  herc <dig>  herc <dig>  ifi <dig>  ifi <dig>  ifi <dig> and ifi44l, which play a variety of antiviral roles  <cit> ; and the cytokine cxcl <dig>  which attracts activated t cells  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

a subset of genes shows unique patterns of expression in each type of infection
after identifying the subset of genes that made up the common transcriptional response, we looked for genes that showed unique transcriptional patterns. to do this, we considered genes that 1) showed a statistically significant increase or decrease in their  <dig> dpi levels of expression for one type of viral infection but not the other, and 2) increased or sustained this difference in expression throughout the later stages of the infection.

in the lassa infection group, we detected several genes with distinctly upregulated expression , including siglec <dig>  a cell adhesion molecule expressed by dendritic cells and macrophages  <cit> ; samd <dig>  a translational repressor  <cit> ; and tnk <dig>  a tyrosine kinase implicated in cell spreading and migration  <cit> . other genes, like cenpf, enpp <dig>  and gzma, a protease responsible for the release of cytotoxic t-cell granules  <cit> , were significantly downregulated during lassa infection in comparison to marburg infection.figure  <dig>

in the marburg infection group, we identified a distinct upregulation in the expression of genes encoding heat shock proteins , the antiapoptotic gene birc <dig>  and the immunoglobulin genes igj, iglv10- <dig>  among others. we also found genes that showed lower levels of expression during marburg infection when compared to lassa infection. examples of these include plk <dig>  a kinase associated with stress response and apoptosis  <cit> ; and nr4a <dig>  a nuclear receptor which has been shown to induce apoptosis when downregulated  <cit> . the patterns of expression for these and other genes are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

validation of infection-specific patterns of expression using microarrays and rt-pcr
we wanted to know if the genes that showed significant differences in each type of infection could be used to classify unknown samples. although we were not able to obtain an independent test dataset, we used additional samples from two previous studies to characterize the host transcriptional response to lassa  <cit>  and marburg infection  . this dataset included the  <dig> samples that we measured using rna sequencing, as well as  <dig> additional uninfected samples,  <dig> lassa-infected samples and  <dig> marburg-infected samples , for a total of  <dig> samples, all of which were quantified using agilent two-color human microarrays. we looked at the genes that we had previously identified  as being differentially expressed during one of the two infections, and found that the measurements from both platforms were highly correlated .

to understand in more detail the differences in expression reported by rna sequencing and microarrays, we classified a subset of genes into four categories: 1) housekeeping genes, those that showed high levels of expression across all samples. 2) common response genes, those where infected samples show higher levels of expression than uninfected samples, and where these levels of expression were similar in both types of infection. 3) marburg-specific response genes, those where marburg-infected samples showed significantly higher  patterns of expression when compared to uninfected or lassa-infected samples. 4) lassa-specific response genes, those where lassa-infected samples showed significantly higher patterns of expression when compared to uninfected or marburg-infected samples.to determine if we could use the genes showing unique regulation at early times of infection to distinguish between different types of infected samples, we applied multidimensional scaling —a dimensionality reduction technique similar to primary component analysis—to the microarray samples. instead of applying mds on the expression of every gene, we chose a subset of common response genes, marburg-specific response genes and lassa-specific response genes . reducing the dimensionality of all samples using these genes resulted in three clear clusters: uninfected samples, infected with lassa virus, and infected with marburg virus. each of the infected clusters contained not only the early-infected samples, but also those samples taken at later stages of infection. this indicates that the expression patterns of these genes are useful indicators throughout both early and late stages of infection.we then looked at the reported expression levels for these genes in both platforms . we only used samples that were quantified in both sequencing and arrays to ensure that differences in variability would only be related to the platform, not to the number of samples. the majority of genes showed similar levels of expression in both platforms. the biggest differences came from genes like hspa1l and igj, which showed much smaller fold changes in arrays than in sequencing. on average, both highly upregulated and downregulated genes showed fold changes with a  <dig> - <dig> times smaller magnitude in arrays when compared to sequencing.this comparison confirmed that both rna sequencing and microarrays show unique changes in mrna levels early after infection. this led us to test the hypothesis that a more direct rt-pcr analysis of a small number of these sentinel genes would show similar patterns of unique regulation, with the advantage that the format of this assay could be applied more quickly and cheaply in the field. we chose to analyze the expression of two genes, siglec <dig> and hspa1b, which showed unique upregulation at early stages of lassa or marburg virus infection, respectively. rt-pcr assays carried out on uninfected samples, and on samples collected 3 days post-infection, showed that there was no statistically significant change in siglec <dig> expression between these two time points in marburg-infected animals, but that there was a 70-fold change in expression in lassa-infected animals. similarly, hspa1b showed a minor change in lassa-infected animals, but a 36-fold change in marburg-infected animals. this confirmed that siglec <dig> becomes upregulated during the early stages of lassa infection but not marburg infection, while hspa1b is only upregulated during the early stages of marburg infection .figure  <dig>

discussion
in the work described in this manuscript, we investigated the hypothesis that the circulating immune response can be used to aid early diagnosis of viral infections that are associated with high levels of mortality. when we analyzed the transcriptional patterns of the circulating immune system in response to two different hemorrhagic fever viruses, we identified a subset of genes that uniquely increased their rate of transcription 3 days after infection and that sustained these differences throughout infection .

an important aspect of this study was that the uniquely regulated genes were not the only genes that changed their patterns of expression during the early times of infection , but that many other genes—pattern recognition receptors, interferon-stimulated genes, cytokines, and immune and antiviral transcriptional regulators—also became rapidly upregulated. this suggests that early after infection, there is a strong activation of the type i interferon innate immune response. this early innate response has also been reported for infections with other viruses, such as ebola  <cit> , influenza  <cit>  and respiratory syncytial virus   <cit> , and suggests that the activation of the innate immune system is being driven by a different mechanism. surprisingly, we did not detect a significant upregulation of type i interferon genes, although we did see it for their downstream effectors. protein studies indicate that type i interferon is present during marburg virus infection, suggesting that interferon transcription might be localized to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are not strongly represented in the pbmc population  <cit> .

in addition to the common transcriptional changes that we observed at early times of infection, we also identified a number of genes with unique patterns of expression in each type of infection. the unique markers of marburg infection were generally classifiable into functional categories, including heat-shock proteins  and immunoglobulin-associated genes . these results suggest that the response to marburg infection leads to the expansion of both stress adaptive and immunological maturation pathways at very early times of infection.

some of the most uniquely expressed genes during lassa infection are siglec <dig>  and samd4a. the upregulation of these genes suggests an increase in siglec1+ samd4a + macrophages early in lassa infection  <cit> . a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms leading to the unique signatures identified will require further investigation. while both lassa virus and marburg virus are known to evade antiviral responses by inhibiting the expression of specific host genes  <cit> , it is unlikely that these mechanisms are directly responsible for the expression differences that we found in pbmcs, since they take place during the pre-viremic stages of infection. the specific differences observed take place even in the absence of any viral genetic material in the pbmcs, which suggests that these circulating cells are responding to an external signal. an alternative explanation for the existence of unique signatures might be related to each pathogen’s cell tropism: marburg virus preferentially targets monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and kupffer cells  <cit> , and leads to significant lymphocyte apoptosis  <cit> . lassa virus targets dendritic cells, kupffer cells, hepatocytes, adrenal cortical cells and endothelial cells  <cit> , and is not known to induce lymphocyte decreases. it is possible that a combination of which cells become initially infected and the magnitude of the early response combine to ultimately produce the infection-specific signatures that we observe.

we have shown that microarrays can be used to validate the changes in expression that take place in lassa- and marburg-infected pbmcs in addition to rna sequencing. although the majority of genes that undergo significant early changes in expression were highly correlated in both platforms, microarrays showed a smaller range of gene expression differences between both types of infected samples and greater variability. three previous studies that analyzed the immune response to lassa virus infection  <cit>  and lcmv virus infection  <cit>  were in general agreement with the major trends that we identified using rna sequencing: mainly the upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, pattern recognition receptors and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

the infection-specific transcriptional changes that we have found suggest a method for discriminating between diseases with similar early clinical symptoms, as is the case for lassa and marburg infection. in infected animals, these transcriptional changes take place prior to the appearance of viremia and other overt symptoms  <cit> , and they remain sustained throughout the late stages of infection, thereby providing a way to diagnose which virus is most likely causing the infection. this diagnosis can be carried out during the early time window when treatment is most effective, and before the pathogen starts replicating in the bloodstream on a massive scale. to ensure that an rt-pcr-based diagnostic would be able to distinguish between diseases other than lassa and marburg disease, it would be important to determine the host transcriptional response to additional pathogens like influenza virus, dengue virus or the malaria parasite, which cause similar initial symptoms to those of viral hemorrhagic fevers.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of a unique set of host genes increases or decreases preferentially in lassa- or marburg-infected immune cells. during marburg virus infection, heat-shock protein and immunoglobulin genes show significantly greater levels of expression than during lassa virus infection, which is characterized by the upregulation of the cell adhesion molecule siglec <dig>  the translational repressor samd4a and the tyrosine kinase tnk <dig>  these changes in expression appear early after infection and remain sustained throughout the entire course of disease, which provides a way to diagnose which virus is most likely to be causing the infection without having to wait until the appearance of viremia or other overt symptoms. the fact that these changes were identified using multiple platforms  suggests a path for translating these gene expression profiles into a diagnostic test with direct clinical applications.
