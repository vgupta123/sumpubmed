BACKGROUND
recombinant proteins are massively used in medicine as diagnostic reagents, drugs or vaccines. moreover, the rapid discovery of new pharmaceutical proteins leads to an increased demand for their production  <cit> . to date, production of recombinant proteins mainly relies on microbial fermentation or on insect and mammalian cell cultures. these systems allow highly controlled manufacturing procedures essential for product quality. however, they have disadvantages in term of cost and scalability. pathogen contamination of animal cell cultures also represent an important safety issue.

plants are now being recognised as an alternative system for the production of recombinant proteins. plant expression systems allow large scale production of recombinant proteins with accurate folding and assembly of protein complexes  <cit> . importantly, plant systems offer the possibility of lowering production costs by a factor of  <dig> to  <dig> compared to traditional systems  <cit> . chloroplasts have proven a useful cellular compartment for protein accumulation owing to their large size and number. moreover, transplastomic plants  enable high yields in recombinant proteins due to a high transgene copy number and limited epigenetic phenomena  <cit> . contamination of wild and crop species by pollen flow is also largely circumvented by organellar transformation  <cit> .

important issues for industrial production of plant-derived recombinant proteins are extraction and purification  <cit> . standard protocols include homogenisation of plant biomass followed by chromatographic methods. however, high abundance of secondary compounds, especially in tobacco, is problematic for chromatographic procedures. therefore, developing a cost-effective preliminary  purification step is required  <cit> .

the chloroplast has several interior compartments: the envelope membranes, the thylakoid membranes and lumen, the stroma and plastoglobules. so far, the stroma has been the major target for protein accumulation in plastids  <cit> . plastoglobules are low density lipoprotein particles attached to the thylakoid membranes  <cit>   and coated with proteins of the pap-fibrillin family  <cit> . the recently determined proteome  <cit>  of arabidopsis plastoglobules identified eight pap-fibrillin proteins .

in this study, we examined the sequence requirement for correct targeting of the plastoglobulin of  <dig> kda . we then used the genomic sequence of pgl <dig> to target a fluorescent protein  to plastoglobules and took advantage of the low density of plastoglobules for rapid enrichment of the recombinant protein by flotation centrifugation, yfp allowing detection throughout the procedure.

RESULTS
sequence requirement for targeting of pgl34-gfp to plastoglobules
in the absence of data on the sequence requirement for plastoglobule targeting, we designed a series of c-terminal gfp fusion constructs that removed portions of pgl <dig> coding sequence . pgl <dig> is a representative member of the arabidopsis pap-fibrillin family.

three domains with somewhat higher hydrophobic scores can be recognised in the kyte and doolittle hydropathy plot of pgl <dig> . these domains comprise residues 80– <dig> , 142– <dig> and 273– <dig> . furthermore, any domain responsible for targeting or anchoring plastoglobulins to plastoglobules may be conserved among the different members of the pap-fibrillin family. sequence alignments  revealed that a central domain in pgl <dig>  is conserved among the pap-fibrillin family.

both homology and hydropathic criteria were therefore taken into account for the choice of the deletion constructs. the shortest construct  only comprised  <dig> residues in addition to the predicted transit peptide and was designed as a stromal control. the second construct, comprising the amino acids 1– <dig> , contained the h <dig> domain as well as the conserved central domain. the construct pgl341–170-gfp additionally included the h <dig> motif. the fourth construct  comprised h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> motifs, as well as the conserved domain. an additional n-terminal deletion construct , lacking residues 57– <dig>  contained the h <dig> and h <dig> motifs but not h <dig> and the central domain.

as shown in fig. 2b, pgl341–56-gfp and pgl341–133-gfp gave diffuse signals broadly overlapping with the autofluorescence of the chlorophyll. in several chloroplasts however, peak gfp and chlorophyll fluorescence did not overlap, suggesting that both fusion proteins localised in the stroma. in contrast, when pgl341–290-gfp construct was expressed in protoplasts, the fusion protein localised to small punctate structures, similarly to the full length protein. a distinct pattern was observed with pgl341–170-gfp and pgl341– <dig> .134–308-gfp constructs. fewer and larger fluorescent spots were observed in chloroplasts, suggesting mistargeting or protein aggregation. the same observation was made with constructs comprising residues 1– <dig> or 1– <dig> of pgl <dig> .

to verify the integrity of each gfp-fusion protein, transformed protoplasts were analysed by western blotting using an anti-gfp serum . with the exception of pgl341– <dig> .134–308-gfp which could not be detected due to low expression levels, all gfp-fusion proteins migrated at the expected mass. mistargeting  of pgl <dig> deletion constructs imply that the corresponding fusion proteins do not colocalise with full-length pgl <dig>  we therefore cotransformed protoplasts with pgl34-cfp and pgl <dig> deletion constructs fused to yfp . as revealed in merged fluorescent images, cfp and yfp signals did not overlap in protoplasts expressing pgl <dig> and pgl341– <dig>  in contrast, pgl34-cfp and pgl341–290-yfp colocalised, indicating that the short c-terminal hydrophilic part of the protein is dispensable for targeting. the strong punctate signals observed in protoplasts expressing pgl341– <dig> were not labelled with pgl34-cfp, confirming mistargeting and/or aggregation of the truncated protein.

transgenic plants expressing yfp fused at the c-terminus of pgl34
the results obtained with pgl34-gfp deletion constructs suggested that most of the protein sequence is required for plastoglobule targeting. to address the potential of plastoglobule targeting for protein purification, arabidopsis plants were transformed with the coding sequence of yfp replacing the stop codon in the genomic sequence of pgl <dig> . the chimeric coding sequence was placed under the control of pgl <dig> promoter and terminator in order to minimise the risk of gene silencing. eleven primary transformants  were isolated and homozygous lines containing a single insertion locus were selected by segregation analysis . expression of pgl34g-yfp in these lines was analyzed using both western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. a wide range of transgene expression levels was observed , possibly reflecting positional effects of the t-dna insertions  <cit> . a double band was detected in the transgenic plant extracts, the upper band possibly reflecting partial cleavage of the chloroplast targeting sequence.

the t <dig> line  <dig> , accumulating the highest level of recombinant protein, was chosen for subsequent analysis. the concentration of recombinant protein in crude extracts was quantified by comparing immunoblot signals with serial dilutions of purified gfp produced in escherichia coli . pgl34-yfp was calculated to account for approximately  <dig> %  of total leaf proteins.

strongest yfp fluorescence was detected in leaves  and roots showed comparably lower yfp signals, consistent with the expression pattern of pgl <dig> determined by microarray analysis  <cit> . a detailed picture of pgl34-yfp signals was obtained by confocal microscopy analysis of transgenic leaves . punctate signals were observed in epidermal as well as in mesophyll cells. yfp patterns were similar to those observed in protoplasts transiently expressing pgl34-yfp , indicating targeting of the yfp cargo to plastoglobules in planta.

phenotype of plants accumulating pgl34-yfp
transgenic plants accumulating pgl34-yfp were indistinguishable from the wild-type when grown in short or long-day conditions . the germination rate of transgenic seeds was equal to wild type . no difference in fresh weight was observed between wild type and transgenic plants , indicating that growth was not altered in plants overexpressing pgl34g-yfp.

in sub-optimal photosynthetic conditions, the photosystem ii  is subject to photoinhibition, characterised by a decrease of maximum ps ii quantum efficiency . fluorometry revealed similar fv/fm fluorescence values in transgenic vs. wild type leaves , ruling out major inhibitory effects of plastoglobule targeting on photosynthesis.

recombinant protein purification by flotation centrifugation
plastoglobules were isolated from chloroplast membranes prepared from transgenic leaves using sucrose density gradient flotation centrifugation . fractions collected from the density gradient were analyzed by sds-page followed by western blotting . the blots were probed with anti-pgl <dig> , anti-toc <dig>  and anti-cab  antibodies as plastoglobule, envelope and thylakoid markers, respectively. the results demonstrated the separation of plastoglobules  from envelope  and thylakoid membranes . pgl34-yfp, detected by anti-gfp antibodies, co-distributed with pgl <dig>  moreover, globular fluorescent structures were highly abundant in low-density fractions , demonstrating targeting of the recombinant protein to plastoglobules.

sds-page analysis of the low-density fractions revealed a prominent band with an apparent mass of  <dig> kda consistent with the predicted mass of pgl34-yfp . this band was recognized by anti-gfp antibodies . similar to immunodetection on total leaf extracts , an additional faint band, migrating at  <dig> kda, was also recognized by the antibody. analysis by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed that both bands contained pgl34-yfp . the upper band may reflect partial cleavage of the chloroplast targeting sequence or post translational modifications of pgl34-yfp. however, mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides derived from the two protein bands yielded no additional evidence with regard to the two possibilities.

to estimate the enrichment factor resulting from the gradient flotation, the amount of recombinant protein in the 5% sucrose step  was determined by comparing immunoblot signals with a dilution series of purified gfp . pgl34-yfp accounted for about 50% of the protein content. based on this and the pgl34-yfp concentration in leaves , the gradient flotation step had lead to an approximately  <dig> fold enrichment of the recombinant protein.

pgl <dig> homologues in cultivated plant species
to determine whether proteins similar to pgl <dig> are present in cultivated plant species, sequence homology searches were performed. as shown in fig.  <dig>  protein sequences with significant blast hits were found in monocots and in a broad range of dicot taxa. pairwise comparisons performed with the matgat software  <cit>  revealed that the protein sequences shown in fig.  <dig> were at least 40% similar. arabidopsis pgl <dig> shared for example 79% similarity and 63% identity with the protein sequence deduced from a tobacco est assembly. these data indicate that proteins from the pap/fibrillin family are highly conserved in the plant kingdom.

discussion
sequence requirement for protein targeting to plastoglobules
the presence of proteins associated with plastoglobules implies that mechanisms ensuring protein assembly in plastoglobules must exist in plastids. however, nothing is known regarding these mechanisms and plastoglobulins do not share conserved sequence motifs with other plant or animal lipid body proteins. several types of proteins associated with lipid bodies have been described in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . they have highly diverse physicochemical properties and topologies, reflecting various modes of association with the lipidic structures. in desiccation tolerant seeds, oil bodies are coated with oleosins  <cit> . a 72-residue central hydrophobic domain in the proteins, often referred to as "proline knot motif" is essential for their association with oil bodies  <cit> . in mammalian cells, under certain conditions, caveolins accumulate at the surface of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. using deletion constructs, ostermeyer et al.  <cit>  demonstrated requirement of a hydrophobic domain for lipid droplet targeting of caveolin- <dig>  hydrophobic domains were also shown to play important roles in targeting and anchoring perilipin to lipid droplets in adipocytes  <cit> . if several lipid body proteins are characterised by hydrophobic domains, others lack large apolar regions. adipophilin , which localises to the periphery of cytosolic lipid bodies in mammalian cells, has no obvious lipid-binding motif  and discontinuous stretches of the protein are necessary for targeting to lipid bodies  <cit> .

although plastoglobulins associate with lipid bodies, their overall amino acid composition is not hydrophobic  index = - <dig>  for pgl34) and it is apparent from hydropathy plots that the proteins, in contrast to oleosins, lack a strongly hydrophobic domain . therefore, association of pgls with plastoglobules may rather rely on interactions with surface lipids, as proposed by kim et al.  <cit> , similarly to adrp  <cit> . based on our observation that the almost complete sequence of pgl <dig> is necessary to maintain proper targeting , we propose that a correct folding of pap/fibrillins rather than a sequence determinant is requested for assembly in plastoglobules.

similarities between plastoglobules and seed oil-bodies
a successful technology for production and recovery of recombinant proteins expressed in seeds from oilseed plants has recently been developed at sembiosys  <cit> . in the so-called stratosome™ system, proteins of interest fused to an oleosin moiety are targeted to oilbodies and recovered by subsequent centrifugation steps  <cit> . biologically active human insulin has notably been produced from arabidopsis seeds using this system  <cit> .

plastoglobules and seed oilbodies share similarities. they are of low density due to their high lipid content and only contain a few different proteins  <cit>  – both properties being advantageous for purification by density partitioning. whereas oleosin-coated lipid bodies accumulate predominantly in the cell cytoplasm of oleaginous seeds, in tapetum cells and in pollen grains  <cit> , plastoglobules are ubiquitously found in all types of plastids  <cit> , notably in leaf chloroplasts. in leaf crops such as tobacco producing high biomass, plastoglobule targeting would allow downstream processing of leaf material similar to the oilbody-oleosin system in seeds.

future perspectives
in this proof-of-concept study, a strong enrichment in pgl34-yfp was achieved. we expect that the yield of plastoglobulin-fusion proteins will be readily improved in follow-up studies using tissues accumulating plastoglobules or related fibrills such as fruits or senescing leaves  <cit>  and/or using plastid genetic engineering  <cit> . the general usefulness of the plastoglobule-plastoglobulin system is predicted since plastoglobulins as well as plastoglobules are highly conserved throughout the plant kingdom and many homologues have been identified in genome and est sequencing projects . in particular leafy crop plants such as tobacco may be ideal to exploit the potential of the plastoglobule targeting system in molecular farming approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of protein accumulation in plastoglobules. sequestration of recombinant proteins in the particles may limit deleterious effects on photosynthetic light and dark reactions. plastoglobule accumulation combines the advantages offered by a chloroplast localization and, as in seed oil-bodies, of a simple enrichment step needed prior to standard chromatographic purification.
