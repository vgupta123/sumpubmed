BACKGROUND
dna-binding proteins  are very important constituent of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes. it has been reported that approximately 2–3% of prokaryotic and 6–7% of eukaryotic proteins can bind to dna  <cit> . these proteins play important roles in dna packaging, replication, transcription regulation and other activities associated with dna. hence proteins that target specific dna sequences can be a potential therapeutics for genetic diseases and cancers. in the form of restriction enzymes, dna-bps play a crucial role in prokaryotic host defence. due to different functions dna-bps are diverse group of proteins both in terms of amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures. hence, identification of dna-bps can play a vital role in proteome annotation and understanding an important class of proteins.

in past, several methods have been developed for predicting dna-bps. broadly, these methods can be divided into two categories i) prediction from protein structure and ii) prediction from amino acid sequence. structure based prediction methods discriminate dna-binding and non-binding proteins with high accuracy on the basis of positively charged electrostatic patches  <cit> , dna-binding structural motifs  <cit> , protein sequence composition, solvent accessibility and secondary structure  <cit> , net charge, dipole and quadrapole moments,  <cit>  and size of largest positive surface patch and amino acid composition  <cit> . unfortunately, these methods can't be used in high throughput annotation, as they require the structure of a protein for prediction. cai and lin  <dig>  used pseudo-amino acid composition as input for support vector machine  to discriminate rna, rrna and dna binding proteins from non-binding proteins   <cit> . recently yu et al.   <cit>  has developed a svm based method for prediction of rrna, rna and dna binding proteins. they used a feature vector of dimension  <dig>  which includes amino acid composition and composition of physico-chemical properties.

in this work, a systematic attempt has been made to predict dna-bps from their amino acid sequences using various features of proteins, like amino acid composition. first, we analyzed the amino acid composition of dna-binding proteins and based on the observation, svm models have been developed using amino acid, dipeptide and four-part amino acid compositions of proteins. besides composition, we also developed svm models using pssm profiles obtained from psi-blast. we also examined the performance of similarity search  and motif-finding  approaches. all models developed in this study were evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique.

RESULTS
svm models
prediction of dna-binding domains/chains
svm models have been developed on dnaset or main dataset, which has dna-binding and non-binding chains obtained from pdb. first, composition based svm model has been developed for predicting dna-binding domains and achieved the accuracy of  <dig> % with mcc,  <dig>  . in order to understand the high success rate, we compared the amino acid compositions of dna-binding and non-binding domains in dnaset . as shown in figure  <dig>  few residues like lys, arg and glu are abundant in dna-binding domains where as other residues like gly are less frequent in dna-binding domains. due to these significant compositional differences dna-binding domains can be predicted with high accuracy. in general, svm models based on dipeptides perform better than amino acid composition based models. however, in this study its performance was poor. in addition, earlier studies showed that the performance of split-amino acid composition was better than amino acid composition. hence, we developed svm models using amino acid composition of four non-overlapping parts of a protein. as shown in table  <dig>  svm model developed with four-part composition was not as efficient as amino acid composition based model. further, it has been well documented that evolutionary information in form of pssm profiles provides more information, which significantly improved the accuracy of prediction in several studies, such as rna binding sites, subcellular localization, β-turns etc  <cit> . thus, we developed svm models using pssm profiles and achieved the overall accuracy of  <dig> % with mcc,  <dig> . the performance of all svm modules developed using dnaset is shown in form of roc plot in figure  <dig>  we also performed self-consistency test and achieved very high accuracy .

prediction on dna-binding proteins
we developed svm models on dnaaset, which consists of  <dig> dna-binding proteins and equal number of non-binding proteins. this dataset have full-length proteins extracted from swiss-prot. as shown in table  <dig>  with amino acid composition we achieved the accuracy of  <dig> % with mcc,  <dig> . the performance of svm model improved significantly using evolutionary information obtained from pssm profiles, which raised the accuracy and mcc to  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. performance of all svm modules in form of roc plot is shown in figure s <dig> 

quality of pssm profiles
as shown in table  <dig>  the pssm based svm models perform better than other models. in order to examine the effect of pssm quality on the performance of svm model, we generated pssm profiles from our training dataset  instead of 'nr' protein database. the performance of svm model using pssm decreased significantly from  <dig> % to  <dig> % when pssm generated from dnaset instead of "nr" . we examined the reason for the poor performance and found that a large number of query protein did not have any psi-blast hit when searched against dnaset. thus, we evaluated performance of svm model on proteins having psi-blast hits  and proteins having no psi-blast hits . we achieved the accuracy of  <dig> % for proteins having psi-blast hits and accuracy of  <dig> % for proteins having no psi-blast hits . the pssm based svm model performed worse than svm model based on amino acid composition on proteins having no psi-blast hit. the svm model based on pssm generated from "nr" database performed better than that generated with our dataset . this demonstrates that performance of pssm based svm model is affected by quality of pssm and performs better if pssm is generated from similar sequences. in the absence of similarity its performance will be poor .

performance on blind dataset
it is important to examine the performance of the newly developed model on an independent dataset. in this study, we evaluated the performance of our svm models  on independent dataset called dnaiset, which consists of  <dig> nbps  and  <dig> dna-bps  obtained from wang and brown   <cit> . at default threshold of  <dig> , our pssm based svm model correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> dna-bps and  <dig> out of  <dig> nbps . this demonstrates that our svm model performs equally well on independent dataset.

performance on realistic dataset
in real life, the number of non-binding proteins is significantly higher than dna-bps. thus, it is important to build and evaluate svm models on more realistic data rather than equal number of dna-bps and nbps. hence, we developed a realistic dataset , which has  <dig> dna-binding domains and  <dig> nbps. first, we developed svm model using amino acid composition on dnarset and achieved the maximum mcc of  <dig>  with accuracy,  <dig> %. then we developed pssm based svm model and achieved the maximum mcc of  <dig>  with accuracy,  <dig> %. as shown in table  <dig>  pssm based model performed better than composition-based model both in terms of sensitivity and specificity. these results further confirmed the importance of evolutionary information in predicting the dna-bps.

comparison with existing methods
it is important to compare the performance of newly developed method with existing methods in order to demonstrate its capabilities. we compared the performance of above svm models with similarity and motif-based approaches, which are commonly used for functional annotation of proteomes. as shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the sensitivity of both modules dna-blast  <cit>  and dna-psiblast  <cit>  was about 10% at e-value of  <dig> , when evaluated on dnaset using five fold cross-validation technique. we also evaluated the performance of meme/mast on dnaset and observed poor performance, where only  <dig> domains showed motif at e-value cut-off of  <dig>  these results demonstrated that our svm models perform better than commonly used techniques like blast, meme/mast.

most of the existing methods predict dna binding proteins from proteins structures. these structure based prediction methods are not suitable for high throughput genome annotation, as they require the structure of a protein. best of authors knowledge, three methods have been developed in the past for predicting dna-bps from their amino acid sequences. ahmad et al.   <cit>  developed a neural network based method using amino acid composition and reported the accuracy of  <dig> %. they used small but clean and non-redundant dataset, which consists of  <dig> dna-bps obtained from pdb and  <dig> non-binding proteins obtained from swiss-prot. their dataset was similar to our main dataset , where we achieved the maximum accuracy of  <dig> % using amino acid composition and  <dig> % using pssm profiles. cai and lin   <cit>  developed a svm based method using pseudo-amino acid composition and obtained the average accuracy of 81%. although they compiled a large dataset, it was neither non-redundant nor clean because it contained all proteins including probable dna-bps. yu et al.   <cit>  developed a svm based method using various physical-chemical properties and showed an average accuracy of  <dig> %. they collected binding and non-binding proteins as proposed by cai and lin   <cit>  from swiss-prot and created a non-redundant dataset of  <dig> dna-bps and  <dig> non-binding proteins. on alternate dataset  which was identical to yu et. al.   <cit> , we achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % using pssm based svm model. this demonstrates that our method performs better than other existing methods. the usage of svm, which performs better than ann, particularly on small dataset and evolutionary information in the form of pssm profiles, improved the performance of the present method.

prediction of dna-binding domains vs proteins
in this study, we developed modules for predicting dna binding proteins using two types of datasets; i) dnaset consists of partial sequences  or dna binding domains, and ii) dnaaset consists of full-length dna-binding proteins. the question arises whether modules trained on dnaset  will be applicable for predicting full dna-binding protein or vice versa. we predicted the proteins in dnaaset using amino acid composition based svm module trained on dnaset and achieved the accuracy of about 55%. similarly, we predicted proteins in dnaset using amino acid composition based svm module trained on dnaaset and achieved the accuracy of about 63%. this revealed that the model trained on partial sequences or domains is not valid for predicting full dna binding proteins and vice versa. in order to understand the reason of failure, we computed and compared amino acid compositions of dna binding and non-binding proteins in dnaaset . the dna-binding and non dna-binding proteins have significantly different amino acid compositions in dnaset whereas such a trend is not observed in dnaaset . it is due to the fact that dnaaset has full length dna-binding proteins, which may also have other domains including non dna-binding domains. thus, prediction performance of methods trained and tested on dnaset are more accurate than on dnaaset. it also explains the reasons for the failure of methods trained on full proteins  and tested with domain dataset , and vice versa. this shows that separate methods are necessary for predicting dna-binding domains and dna-binding proteins.

it is also possible that our models were over trained. in order to rule-out this possibility, we evaluated the performance with other existing methods. we found two methods available for public:  dbs-pred developed on dna-binding domains  <cit>  and  svm-prot developed on full dna-binding proteins  <cit> . the performance of dbs-pred was evaluated on a dataset of  <dig> dna binding and  <dig> non-binding proteins extracted from swiss-prot. as shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  we achieved the maximum performance of 63% at 30% probability threshold. this means that the performance on dbs-pred is also poor on full proteins. similarly, the performance of svm-prot was evaluated on dnaset; svm-prot predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> dna-binding proteins and  <dig> out of  <dig> non-binding proteins when all hits are considered for evaluation; if only top hit was considered svm-prot was able to identify <dig> out of  <dig> sequences  as dna-binding proteins. this analysis showed that svm-prot developed on full protein is not suitable for partial or domain sequences.

webserver
the prediction method described in this paper is implemented in the form of a web-server dnabinder . the common gateway interface script of dnabinder is written using perl version  <dig> . dnabinder server is installed on a sun server  under unix  environment. this server allows users to predict dna-binding proteins using amino acid composition and pssm based svm models trained on dnaset, dnarset and dnaaset. models trained on dnaset or dnarset are suitable for predicting dna-binding domains/chains, whereas models trained on dnaset are suitable for predicting dna-binding full length proteins. server allows submission of multiple sequences for prediction in case of composition based model and submission of one sequence at a time in case of pssm based model. in case of pssm based model, we use this model if psi-blast finds significant hits for query sequence; otherwise only simple composition based model is used for prediction.

discussion
dna-binding proteins are one of the major classes of proteins playing a central role in cellular metabolism. due to their importance in the regulation of gene-expression and other processes, several methods have been developed for predicting dna-bps. most of them predict dna-bps using their structural information. these methods have limited scope because the structures are unknown for most of the proteins. in this paper, we developed a highly accurate method for predicting dna-bps from their amino acid sequences. the reliability of any prediction method mainly depends on clean and valid dataset. in past, two types of datasets have been used:  small and clean dataset with experimentally validated dna-bps obtained from pdb  <cit>  and  large dataset, where sequences were obtained from swiss-prot  <cit> . in this study we developed our models on two datasets called dnaset or main dataset and dnaaset or alternate dataset in order to benchmark our newly developed method with existing methods. most of our study was based on dnaset because it has clean and experimentally validated dna-bps where as dnaaset may also include fragments and putative proteins.

in any functional annotation, the primary step is to search a query protein against database of annotated proteins  and assign the function if query protein has significant similarity with target proteins. similarity based annotation is highly accurate if an experimentally annotated homologous protein is found. but the major challenge is to predict function of a protein in absence of significant similarity. thus, we developed a method using non-redundant dataset, where similarity between proteins in test and training datasets is very low. we applied similarity search and motif finding techniques on our dataset and found poor performance, as expected. hence, we have developed ann and svm models on dnaset using amino acid and dipeptide compositions for predicting dna-bps. we achieved an accuracy of  <dig> % from ann model using amino acid composition, which is slightly better than ahmad et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  . it may be due to the increase in the number of dna-bps in dnaset. it is interesting to note that the performance of svm was significantly better than ann. thus, we developed rest of the models using svm. we achieved significantly high accuracy of  <dig> % using svm model based on simple amino acid composition. this demonstrates the importance of machine learning techniques in prediction of dna-bps. in order to enhance the performance further, svm models have been developed using dipeptide and four-part compositions. unexpectedly, the performance of dipeptides and four-part composition based svm models is poorer than composition-based svm model. the standard techniques like blast, psi-blast and meme/mast failed to predict dna-bps when tested on dnaset due to low similarity among domains/chains in dnaset.

this is the first study that used evolutionary information to discriminate dna-bps from non-binding proteins. we extracted evolutionary information of a protein from pssm profiles obtained form psi-blast search against "nr". the accuracy of the method improved significantly from  <dig> % to  <dig> % using pssm profiles, when evaluated on dnaset. the quality of pssm profiles, of a query sequence depends on similar sequences in a target database. as shown in table  <dig>  performance of svm based model decreases significantly when pssm generated from dnaset instead of "nr" dataset. this is due to fact that "nr" is a very large database in comparison to dnaset and hence the chances of getting similar sequences are very high when a sequence is searched against "nr" database. thus, quality of pssm profiles will be superior in case of "nr". we also examined psi-blast hits and observed that each protein in dnaset has blast hits when searched against "nr" database. we also demonstrate that pssm based models perform better, if there is significant blast hits . as database of "nr" is growing exponentially due to number of sequencing projects the quality of pssm profiles will improve over the times, which eventually improve the performance of pssm based models. in dnabinder server, first we examine whether a query sequence has any blast hit in "nr"; if yes, pssm based model will be used and otherwise amino acid composition based svm model will be used for prediction.

it is well known that similarity/motif based methods perform better than ab-initio classifiers if a query protein has significant similarity with target proteins. the major challenge is to develop a method, which can identify a novel dna binding protein even if it has no sequence similarity with any of the known dna-bps. hence, we took non-redundant proteins in our main dataset. if we have taken redundant proteins then similarity based method would have performed better than other methods. our svm model based on amino acid composition performed well on a dataset where similarity based method failed to detect dna-bps. this demonstrates that models developed in this study are capable to identify novel dna-bps. the svm model based on pssm further improved the accuracy by 6–7%. the question arises why we generate pssm from 'nr' protein database instead of our own dataset whereas we are assessing blast/psi-blast and meme/mast on dnaset. there is a fundamental difference between blast/psi-blast searching and svm model using pssm profiles. in case of blast/psi-blast one need to search only against well annotated proteins because we have to assign the same function to query protein if it has similarity with target protein. in case of pssm it is not important to search a query sequence against the annotated proteins only because we do not assign function based on similarity. it is not important whether query sequence has similarity with dna-bps, nbps or un-annotated proteins for generating pssm profiles. thus, one may create pssm from any database like "nr" in contrast to similarity-based methods, where we need to search against well-annotated proteins only.

the main objective of this study is to develop a prediction method for identification of new dna-binding proteins and particularly annotating the newly sequenced genomes. most of the existing methods developed in past have been trained on experimentally annotated dna-binding protein chains/domains obtained from pdb. the models developed on dataset of protein chains like dnaset are suitable for predicting dna binding domains but not for predicting dna-bps. in order to develop method for predicting dna-binding proteins, we also developed svm model using dnaaset, consists of full-length dna-binding and non-binding proteins. thus, models developed on dnaaset will be suitable for predicting dna-bps. the performance of our svm model was slightly better than svm model of yu et al,  <dig>  <cit> , using amino acid composition on same dataset. the difference in the performance of svm may be due to optimization of learning parameters as yu et al.,  <dig>  <cit>  used the default parameters of svm_light where as we used optimized parameters. our svm model using pssm profiles performs better than the svm model of yu et al.  <dig>  <cit> , based on physicochemical properties by 3%. these results suggest that evolutionary information is important for predicting dna-binding proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a highly accurate method for predicting dna-bps using the machine learning technique, svm. for the first time, evolutionary information has been used to predict dna-binding proteins. it has been observed that pssm based models perform better than any other models by 3–7% on all the datasets including independent and realistic datasets. the svm models developed in this study perform better than other existing methods. one of the major features of this study is that we developed a publicly available web server and stand-alone software, which allows users to identify the dna-bps in their dataset of proteins. it was observed that models trained on dna domains or partial sequences are not suitable for predicting dna binding proteins and vice versa. our server, dnabinder allows users to identify dna binding domains using the model trained on dnaset and prediction of dna binding proteins using the model trained on dnaaset. we hope this study will assist the biologist in annotation of genomes.
