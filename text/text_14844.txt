BACKGROUND
myxococcus xanthus is a gram-negative bacterium that provides an attractive model for investigating signaling and gene regulatory mechanisms during a multicellular developmental process  <cit> . in the soil, rod-shaped m. xanthus cells coordinate their movements much like a pack of wolves, allowing them to efficiently lyse prey bacteria and feed on their contents  <cit> . when the food supply dwindles, cells change their pattern of movements, forming aggregation centers where cells pile on top of one another. the resulting mounds mature into fruiting bodies as some of the cells differentiate into ovoid spores that are resistant to environmental insults and are metabolically quiescent. other cells remain outside of fruiting bodies as peripheral rods  <cit>  and the majority of cells lyse during the developmental process . signaling between and within cells coordinates their movements, gene expression, and differentiation to reliably build fruiting bodies that each contain about  <dig> spores  <cit> . the spores can germinate when nutrients reappear, producing a swarm of rod-shaped cells that can feed efficiently. here, we focus on the role of a key transcription factor in the m. xanthus developmental process, reporting for the first time for this organism the results of genome-wide binding analysis.

the genome of m. xanthus is large  for a bacterium and it abounds with genes coding for proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . gene duplication and divergence appears to account for most of the genome expansion. certain types of genes are overrepresented among those duplicated. for example, many of the  <dig> predicted serine/threonine protein kinase  genes  <cit>  appear to have arisen by duplication and divergence  <cit> . at least  <dig> of the stpks play important roles in development, based on gene knockout studies  <cit> . likewise, many of the  <dig> predicted enhancer binding protein  genes that code for activators of σ <dig> rna polymerase appear to have arisen in a similar fashion  <cit>  and also are important for development  <cit> . in addition, there are  <dig> predicted histidine protein kinase  genes, in most cases paired with a response regulator  gene, presumably forming a two-component signal transduction system  <cit> . the tremendous sensory and gene regulatory complexity of m. xanthus is proposed to have evolved to support its sophisticated multicellular lifestyle.

current knowledge of the signaling and gene regulatory network governing m. xanthus development has been described in terms of modular design  <cit> . starvation, intracellular ppgpp, and extracellular a- and c-signals provide input into three gene regulatory modules designated the ebp cascade, mrp, and frua. a simplified view of the regulatory network is shown in additional file  <dig>  starvation initiates ppgpp signaling  <cit>  and the ebp cascade  <cit>  and mrp modules  <cit> . the ebp cascade module enhances ppgpp signaling  <cit>  and the mrp module  <cit> . ppgpp signaling  <cit>  and the ebp cascade module  <cit>  promote production of the a-signal, which is a mixture of amino acids and peptides released by activity of extracellular proteases  <cit> . a-signaling has been proposed to play a quorum-sensing role that at a high enough cell density stimulates expression of certain genes  <cit>  and causes cells to begin building mounds  <cit> . the output of the mrp module is mrpc and its n-terminally truncated form mrpc <dig>  which are transcription factors  that together with ppgpp signaling  <cit> , the ebp cascade module  <cit> , and proteins involved in a-signal production  <cit> , promote c-signal production. the c-signal appears to be an n-terminally truncated form of the csga protein that is produced by proteolytic activity at the cell surface . efficient c-signaling requires alignment of cells, which occurs during fruiting body formation . c-signaling  <cit>  and the ebp cascade module  <cit>  positively regulate the activity of the transcription factor frua by unknown mechanisms that act post-transcriptionally. another input into the frua module occurs at the transcriptional level; mrpc and mrpc <dig> bind to the frua promoter region  <cit>  and appear to directly activate transcription  <cit> . frua and mrpc <dig> have been shown to bind cooperatively to the promoter regions of several genes or operons that are important for aggregation and sporulation . hence, the outputs of the mrp and frua modules appear to directly activate transcription of genes crucial for fruiting body formation .

the mrp module has been studied in considerable detail. the mrp locus was identified by analysis of a transposon insertion mutant with defects in aggregation and sporulation  <cit> . the locus contains three genes . two of the genes are co-transcribed, mrpa coding for a predicted hpk and mrpb encoding a predicted ebp with a receiver domain that may be the target of mrpa kinase and/or phosphatase activity  <cit> . the third gene is mrpc, which is predicted to code for a transcription factor similar to the cyclic amp receptor protein  family  <cit> . mrpb is necessary for transcription of mrpc and mrpc positively autoregulates  <cit> . mrpc accumulation is also regulated post-transcriptionally. a cascade of two stpks in which pkn <dig> phosphorylates pkn <dig>  and pkn <dig> phosphorylates mrpc, inhibits the accumulation and activity of mrpc during growth  <cit> , since mrpc-p binds dna poorly  <cit> . the esp signaling system also inhibits accumulation of mrpc by stimulating its proteolytic turnover  <cit> . the finding that mrpc <dig> is not produced in a bsga mutant suggested that bsga, a protease in the lon family  <cit> , might proteolytically process mrpc to mrpc <dig>  although it remains possible that mrpc <dig> results from alternative initiation of translation  <cit> . mrpc <dig> was proposed to be important for developmental progression since it cannot be phosphorylated by pkn <dig> and it exhibited higher binding activity than mrpc to the mrpc and frua promoter regions  <cit> . however, we did not detect a difference in the binding of mrpc and mrpc <dig> to the frua promoter region . since the precise roles of mrpc and mrpc <dig> remain to be defined and since mrpc is more abundant than mrpc <dig> in developing cells, we refer to both forms of the protein collectively as mrpc hereafter unless specified otherwise. mrpc governs the timing of development. premature accumulation of mrpc results in premature accumulation of frua and premature aggregation and sporulation  <cit> .

how pervasive is regulation by mrpc and frua during m. xanthus development? to begin to address this question, we identified putative mrpc binding sites genome-wide, analyzed their distribution, including their proximity to developmentally-regulated promoters, identified a consensus sequence for mrpc binding, and verified binding of mrpc <dig> to dna sequences matching the consensus. we also tested binding of mrpc <dig> alone or in combination with frua to longer dna segments containing putative mrpc binding sites. our results implicate mrpc as a direct regulator of numerous genes involved in m. xanthus development and suggest that cooperative binding of mrpc and frua is widespread in the m. xanthus genome.

RESULTS
chip-seq reveals a large number of putative mrpc binding sites
m. xanthus that had formed nascent fruiting bodies after 18 h of development were subjected to chip with antibodies against mrpc. successful enrichment of mrpc-bound dna fragments by chip was confirmed by chip-pcr of the fmga promoter region, which was shown previously to bind mrpc  <cit> . chip-seq generated 8- <dig> million reads from each of two samples. after alignment of the chip-seq reads with the m. xanthus genome  <cit> , the alignments were analyzed with quest, a statistical tool that has been shown to detect, with high accuracy and positional resolution, genomic regions associated with chip-seq peaks of significant enrichment compared with a control  <cit> . the control data was obtained by performing chip-seq with igg from a non-immunized rabbit. the two chip-seq samples with anti-mrpc igg provided extremely deep sequencing coverage , resulting for each sample in the detection of a similar, large number of peaks with an extremely low estimated false-positive rate .table  <dig> 
number of significant peaks in each chip-seq replicate and false-positive rates




chip-seq peaks from the two samples with anti-mrpc were highly reproducible. the cumulative distribution of the distances between nearest replicate peaks shows that approximately 73% of significantly-enriched peaks were found within 30 bp of a significantly-enriched peak in the replicate experiment . the remaining 27% of peaks were scattered widely at distances of up to  <dig> kbp from the nearest replicate peak . making the conservative assumption that replicate peaks separated by more than 65 bp have an increased likelihood of being spurious, we filtered the peaks from the two samples using this cutoff, resulting in  <dig> high-confidence peaks . these peaks exhibit high positional conservation across replicates; the median distance between replicate peaks is 8 bp . we conclude that mrpc is specifically associated with a large number of sites in the m. xanthus genome at 18 h into development, when fruiting bodies have formed, and we refer to these sites as putative mrpc binding sites.figure  <dig>

known targets of mrpc are found among the sites identified by chip-seq analysis
direct regulatory targets of mrpc have been characterized previously using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , dnase i footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis/reporter gene expression, and chip-pcr. as expected, we found known targets of mrpc among the sites identified by our chip-seq analysis . for mrpc
 <cit> , frua
 <cit> , a site within the dev operon  <cit> , and fmgd
 <cit> , the position of a significantly-enriched chip-seq peak  matched the position of one or more previously-characterized binding sites for mrpc and/or mrpc <dig>  for fmgbc
 <cit>  and a site upstream of the dev operon  <cit>  a chip-seq peak matched the position of mrpc <dig> binding in vitro, but the peak was not considered significantly enriched in one of the samples and therefore did not pass our stringency thresholds for inclusion among the  <dig> high-confidence peaks . for fmga, a chip-seq peak was centered approximately 200 bp upstream of the mrpc <dig> binding site mapped by dnase i footprinting, which was centered at - <dig>  relative to the fmga transcriptional start site  <cit> . the chip-seq peak is consistent with a prediction of several closely-spaced mrpc binding sites based on sequence analysis  <cit> . these predicted mrpc binding sites might be involved in regulation of mxan_ <dig>  which lies upstream of fmga in divergent orientation. the sites are not involved in fmga regulation based on 5’ deletion analysis of the promoter region fused to a lacz reporter  <cit> . no significantly-enriched chip-seq peaks were found in the fmge promoter region, despite evidence for  <dig> mrpc <dig> binding sites in this region  <cit> . the absence of a significantly-enriched chip-seq peak in one or both samples matching the position of previously-characterized binding sites for mrpc and/or mrpc <dig> in about half the cases represent false-negative results in the chip-seq analysis. this suggests that the number of mrpc binding sites in the m. xanthus genome at 18 h into development is larger than the  <dig> sites we have chosen to analyze. the  <dig> sites may be relatively high-affinity sites for binding of mrpc and/or clusters of binding sites . the fdga promoter region from - <dig> to + <dig> was not bound by his10-mrpc <dig> in emsas  and no significantly-enriched chip-seq peak was observed in this region , providing an example of a true-negative result.table  <dig>

it is instructive to look at the chip-seq peak in the mrpc promoter region . there is experimental evidence for at least  <dig> mrpc binding sites between - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the transcriptional start site  <cit>  , yet quest analysis of the chip-seq data produced a single, broad peak in the region in each replicate , which on average was centered at - <dig> relative to the translation start codon  . this leads to an important caveat when trying to extrapolate individual binding sites from chip-seq peaks. while the reproducibility of the peaks across samples indicated high positional conservation , individual binding sites that are located in close proximity to each other are not resolved, although they might be recognizable based on similarity to a consensus binding sequence . for comparison, additional file  <dig> also shows the chip-seq peak in the frua promoter region, where  <dig> mrpc binding sites have been mapped in vitro
 <cit> . the peak is not as high and not as broad as the peak in the mrpc promoter region, yet both peaks ranked highly among the  <dig> peaks , indicative of high-affinity sites for binding of mrpc and/or clusters of binding sites .

putative mrpc binding sites are found preferentially in predicted non-coding regions and close to predicted translation start codons
a transcription factor such as mrpc would be expected to bind preferentially in non-coding genomic regions. to determine whether the putative mrpc binding sites meet this expectation, the sites were mapped with respect to predicted coding regions in the genome  <cit> . as can be seen in table  <dig>  the  <dig> chip-seq peaks fall preferentially in predicted non-coding regions in comparison with randomly placed peaks within the genome. the chip-seq peak distribution is significantly different from the randomized dataset, p <  <dig>    <cit> . as expected, more than 90% of the randomly placed peaks were in coding regions , since more than 90% of the genome consists of coding regions  <cit> . in contrast, only 61% of the chip-seq peaks were in coding regions .the putative mrpc binding sites also differed from the randomly located sites in terms of distance to the nearest predicted tsc. the putative mrpc binding sites were narrowly distributed around a maximum immediately upstream of the nearest predicted tsc , as would be expected for sites involved in gene regulation. the randomly chosen sites were broadly distributed relative to the nearest predicted tsc .table  <dig>

functional annotation of genes near putative mrpc binding sites reveals no over-represented categories of genes
additional file  <dig> lists the distance between each putative mrpc binding site and the nearest tsc, as well as the functional annotation of the corresponding gene. since most functional transcription factor binding sites are located close to a tsc in bacteria, any putative mrpc binding sites not located between 400 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of a predicted tsc  <cit>  were removed from the dataset. of the  <dig> remaining sites,  <dig> were associated with divergent genes. in these cases, both genes  were included in the analyses that follow.

the distribution of the distance from each putative mrpc binding site to the nearest predicted tsc  was plotted. the putative mrpc binding sites were strongly skewed toward the region immediately upstream of a predicted tsc as compared with an equal number of sites placed at random in the genome using a monte carlo simulation . these results suggest that many of the putative mrpc binding sites are biologically relevant sites involved in gene regulation.

comparing the functional categories of the  <dig> genes with that of all genes in the genome, no categories are over-represented and only one is under-represented with high statistical confidence . the under-represented category is disrupted reading frames, which are presumably non-functional genes, so it is neither surprising that these are under-represented nor particularly informative. the classes of genes that may be over-represented, although not with high statistical confidence, include most notably genes in the categories of protein fate, regulatory functions, signal transduction, and transcription. this suggests that mrpc is regulating other regulators in the network governing developmental gene expression.table  <dig>

putative mrpc binding sites are preferentially located near the 5’ ends of developmental genes
as described above, mrpc and mrpc <dig> appear to directly regulate several developmental genes . to extend this analysis, we compared the  <dig> genes whose predicted tsc is near  a putative mrpc binding site, to various lists of developmental genes. lists of genes directly involved in fruiting body formation, or significantly down- or up-regulated during development, have been described previously  <cit> . we found that putative mrpc binding sites are over-represented near developmentally up-regulated genes with high statistical confidence . they may be over-represented near genes directly involved in development and near genes down-regulated during development, although not with high statistical confidence. in addition to the lists described previously  <cit> , we generated a list of “potentially interesting” genes involved in motility, signaling, or gene expression that may play a role in development . putative mrpc binding sites were not found to be over-represented near the potentially interesting genes in general, but they may be over-represented near the promoter regions of these genes when their likely operon organization is take into account . the genes from each of the four lists that are near a putative mrpc binding site are summarized in additional file  <dig>  these genes are candidates for direct regulation by mrpc and mrpc <dig> table  <dig>

our finding that developmentally up-regulated genes are over-represented near putative mrpc binding sites  is consistent with mrpc functioning as an activator of transcription. it is important to note that the list of up-regulated genes used in this analysis  <cit>  is incomplete. for example, only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in table  <dig> are on the list, yet all  <dig> are up-regulated during development based on lacz fusion and/or rt-pcr analysis. the list is derived from dna microarray experiments with rna harvested at various times between  <dig> and 24 h into development  <cit> , so up-regulated genes could have been missed for several reasons . nevertheless, genes that are up-regulated during development based on the microarray experiments and near a putative mrpc binding site based on our chip-seq analysis include  <dig> predicted to code for an hpk ,  <dig> for an rr ,  <dig> for a hybrid hpk/rr ,  <dig> for an stpk ,  <dig> for a dna-binding protein , and  <dig> for a σ factor  . therefore, mrpc very likely up-regulates more than  <dig> regulators in the network governing developmental gene expression.

among the genes mentioned above that are up-regulated during development based on microarray experiments and near a putative mrpc binding site, several are known to be directly involved in fruiting body formation . these include the hpks espa
 <cit> , sdek
 <cit> , hpk8
 <cit> , the stpks pkta5
 <cit> , pkn8
 <cit> , pska12
 <cit> , and the σ factor sigc
 <cit> . these seven genes are highlighted yellow in columns a and c of additional file  <dig> 

twenty other genes that are known to be directly involved in fruiting body formation were found to be near a putative mrpc binding site . eleven of these are up-regulated during development, based on lacz fusion and/or rt-pcr analysis , even though they were not detected as up-regulated in the dna microarray experiments  <cit> . in two cases, prw
 <cit>  and espc
 <cit> , only expression at the protein level has been examined , and it was observed to increase during development. expression of pkn <dig>  pkte <dig>  crda, pktd <dig>  and pkta <dig> has not been reported, expression of sass-lacz shows little change but was only measured during the first 8 h of development  <cit> , and the level of htha transcript decreased strongly by 6 h into development  <cit> . hence, at least  <dig> genes directly involved in development and near a putative mrpc binding site are up-regulated during development, based on methods other than microarrays. these genes are also highlighted yellow in column a of additional file  <dig>  several of these genes code for protein kinases , including the hpks hpk37
 <cit> , mrpa
 <cit> , espc
 <cit> , asgd
 <cit>  and the stpks pkn9
 <cit> , pkn1
 <cit> , pkn6
 <cit> . adding these  <dig> to the  <dig> hpks,  <dig> hybrid hpk/rrs, and  <dig> stpks mentioned above, a total of  <dig> pks are likely up-regulated by mrpc. some of these negatively regulate development, while others positively regulate development. we conclude that mrpc very likely has a profound effect on phosphorylation-dependent signaling that regulates m. xanthus development.

in addition to pks, putative mrpc binding sites are located near genes that code for transcription factors  and spore proteins  known to be important for fruiting body formation . it was mentioned above that frua and mrpc were known targets of mrpc . also, sigc was noted since it was on the list of genes up-regulated during development based on dna microarray experiments . however, dependence of sigc expression on mrpc has not been tested, and the putative mrpc binding site near sigc is actually closer to the divergent gene mxan_ <dig> predicted to code for a hypothetical protein , although not by much. since sigc but not mxan_ <dig> was up-regulated during development in the dna microarray experiments  <cit> , it is more likely that mrpc activates sigc than mxan_ <dig> transcription, but this will need to be tested. the crda gene is in divergent orientation relative to crdb , the first gene of the che <dig> chemosensory system cluster  <cit> , and the putative mrpc binding site in this region is closer to the predicted crdb tsc . the putative mrpc binding site near the prw gene, which codes for the abundant spore protein w  <cit> , is within the upstream, divergent mxan_ <dig> gene . in addition to divergent genes, operons also need to be considered. for example, actb is in the actabcd operon  <cit> . the putative mrpc binding site is located at - <dig> relative to the predicted actb tsc . therefore, the putative mrpc binding site is within acta, at about + <dig> relative to the transcription start site of the operon  <cit> . whether mrpc directly regulates the promoter of the act operon or a suboperonic promoter located within acta will require careful analysis, especially since the act operon promoter is known to be positively regulated by frua  <cit>  and mrpc appears to be a direct activator of frua transcription  <cit> . the nfsa and nfsh genes are likely in an eight-gene operon  <cit>  whose products are involved in deposition of the polysaccharide spore coat  <cit> . two putative mrpc binding sites are located at - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the predicted nfsa tsc, and one putative mrpc binding site is located within nfsg  at - <dig> relative to the predicted nfsh tsc . these examples illustrate complexities of interpreting the likely significance of putative mrpc binding sites for gene regulation. adding to the uncertainty, most transcription start sites have not been mapped. therefore, even in simple cases like the htha gene, where a putative mrpc binding site is located at - <dig> relative to the predicted tsc , whether mrpc binding to this site accounts for the observed down-regulation of htha
 <cit>  during development is unclear.

ninety-six genes that are down-regulated during development were found to be near putative mrpc binding sites . mrpc has not been reported to act as a repressor of transcription, although it has been suggested to delay transcription of fmgd by competing with frua for binding to a site from which frua appears to activate transcription  <cit> . in striking contrast to the genes that are up-regulated during development and near a putative mrpc binding site, the genes that are down-regulated do not include pks or rrs. on the other hand, the genes that are down-regulated include  <dig> in the functional category  <cit>  of protein fate , more than twice as many as the  <dig> up-regulated genes in that category  . we conclude that mrpc may repress transcription of nearly  <dig> genes during development and in particular this may resculpt the proteome.

putative mrpc binding sites were not over-represented near genes we considered “potentially interesting”, but if we take into account that many of these genes are likely co-transcribed in operons, mrpc binding sites may be enriched in the promoter regions of potentially interesting genes . genes likely to be in operons are highlighted in additional file  <dig>  the number of potentially interesting promoter regions,  <dig>  is considerably less than the total number of potentially interesting genes,  <dig> . strikingly, in  <dig> of  <dig> cases with a putative mrpc binding site near a gene likely in an operon , the site is near the predicted tsc of the likely first gene of the operon , suggesting that the operon promoter is regulated by mrpc. in the other cases, mrpc may regulate a suboperonic promoter.

some of the potentially interesting genes near a putative mrpc binding site are down- or up-regulated during development based on the dna microarray experiments  <cit>  . of the  <dig> genes down-regulated,  <dig> are likely the first gene of an operon, one implicated in a motility  and the other in e-signaling  . the other  <dig> are implicated in s motility , a motility , gene expression , or spore formation . of the  <dig> genes up-regulated,  <dig> is likely the first gene of an operon implicated in spore formation . the other  <dig> are implicated in c-signaling , phase variation , a motility , a-signaling , or s motility . we conclude that mrpc may both down- and up-regulate particular genes involved in both s motility and a motility, as well as in extracellular signaling and spore formation during development.

taken together, our results imply that mrpc directly activates or represses hundreds of genes involved in signaling, transcription, spore formation, protein fate, and motility during development.

putative mrpc binding sites are enriched for a motif that strongly resembles a consensus sequence for mrpc binding
two distinct binding site consensus sequences have been proposed for mrpc   <cit> . to clarify the binding site sequence preference of mrpc, sequences corresponding to the  <dig> top-ranked putative mrpc binding sites  were extracted, including 50 bp of flanking sequence on each side of the chip-seq peak maxima. meme, an expectation maximization algorithm  <cit> , was used to discover motifs that are statistically over-represented in these sequences. only one significant motif was identified  among the various partitions of the data that were searched by meme . this motif is a strong match for the larger of the two motifs proposed previously  <cit>  . the motif is an imperfect palindrome that can be represented as tgtyn8rac, consistent with mrpc binding as a dimer. mrpc is dimeric  <cit> , a common feature of dna-binding proteins in the crp family to which mrpc belongs  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the motif identified by meme analysis of putative mrpc binding sites was compared with binding motifs stored in regtransbase  <cit>  using tomtom  <cit> . a significant match was identified to the consensus binding sequence for the cyclic-amp receptor protein  of e. coli . based on amino acid sequence similarity, mrpc was proposed to be a member of the crp family  <cit> . our data indicate that the two proteins recognize a similar dna sequence.

experimental verification of putative mrpc binding sites
we purified n-terminally his10-tagged versions of mrpc and mrpc <dig> from e. coli engineered for overexpression. we found that expression of his10-mrpc appeared to be toxic to e. coli, but we managed to purify a small amount for comparison with his10-mrpc <dig>  which did not appear to be toxic and was therefore easier to obtain. the two proteins were indistinguishable in binding to a region upstream of the frua promoter . previously, nariya and inouye  <cit>  reported that his10-mrpc <dig> has 8-fold higher binding activity than his10-mrpc for the same dna fragment from the frua upstream region. we do not understand this discrepancy, but since we observed no difference in binding and since his10-mrpc <dig> was much easier to obtain, we used it to test binding to sites identified by our chip-seq analysis. we chose putative mrpc binding sites near genes with a variety of characteristics , amplified 200 bp of dna surrounding the putative site, and performed emsas. as shown previously  <cit>  and as predicted by our chip-seq analysis, his10-mrpc <dig> bound a dna fragment from the mrpc upstream region . different concentrations of his10-mrpc <dig> produced complexes with different migration distances, consistent with the presence of multiple binding sites on the dna fragment. a dna fragment encompassing a putative mrpc binding site upstream of mxan_ <dig> produced  <dig> shifted complexes , suggesting the presence of multiple binding sites, which may account for the high rank of this site on the list of chip-seq peaks . the putative site upstream of mxan_ <dig>  produced a single complex that was inferred to have  <dig> his10-mrpc <dig> bound based on its migration , and  <dig> sites were subsequently verified . the putative sites upstream of bsga and pkn <dig> produced primarily a complex inferred to be bound by  <dig> his10-mrpc <dig> , although a small amount of a complex inferred to have  <dig> his10-mrpc <dig> bound was observed for bsga. all the other putative mrpc binding sites we tested in this way produced one or more complexes , as summarized in additional file  <dig>  as noted above, the fdga promoter region from - <dig> to + <dig> was not bound by his10-mrpc <dig> in emsas . we conclude that most sites identified by our chip-seq analysis likely could be bound specifically by one or more his10-mrpc <dig> in vitro.figure  <dig> 
binding of mrpc <dig> to candidate genes from chip-seq. for the indicated genes, approximately 200 bp of dna surrounding a peak from the chip-seq analysis was amplified by pcr with 32p-labeled primers. these probes  alone  or after addition of his10-mrpc <dig>   were subjected to emsas. mxan_ <dig> and  <dig> were analyzed on the same gel, with intervening lanes removed, as indicated by narrower separation between panels. filled and open arrowheads indicate complexes inferred to have one or two his10-mrpc <dig> bound, respectively.



we searched for the motif identified by meme analysis of putative mrpc binding sites  in the regions encompassing the putative sites tested above. not counting mrpc and frua, which were already known to have matches to the motif  <cit> , we found one or more matches in  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> regions . for each match, we obtained oligonucleotides corresponding to the match plus 11-14 bp on each side and used the annealed oligonucleotides as a probe in emsas with his10-mrpc <dig>  in each case, a complex was observed . for the region upstream of mxan_ <dig>  which had two matches to the motif, probes matching each motif formed a complex, but probe b corresponding to the sequence in between the two motifs and including 10 bp of each motif did not form a complex. these results validate the predictive value of the motif for identifying sequences bound specifically by his10-mrpc <dig> in vitro.figure  <dig> 
binding of mrpc <dig> to predicted sites. for the indicated genes, the sequence matching the motif in figure 3b, plus 11-14 bp on each side, were synthesized and 32p-labeled oligonucleotides were annealed. these probes  alone  or after addition of his10-mrpc <dig>   were subjected to emsas. mxan_ <dig> had two matches to the motif , and probe b contains the sequence in between the matches plus 10 bp of each match .



evidence for cooperative binding of mrpc <dig> and frua
his10-mrpc <dig> and frua-his <dig> have been shown to bind cooperatively in the fmga promoter region by dnase i footprinting analysis  <cit> . in emsas, cooperative binding produced a slow-migrating complex more abundantly than could be accounted for by binding of each protein alone  <cit> , and similar results provide evidence for cooperative binding of the two proteins in the fmgbc
 <cit> , fmgd
 <cit> , fmge
 <cit> , and dev
 <cit>  promoter regions. therefore, we used emsas to test for evidence of cooperative binding to the regions from our chip-seq analysis that were bound by his10-mrpc <dig> as described above. of  <dig> regions tested, we could detect binding of frua-his <dig> alone in  <dig> cases and evidence for cooperative binding with his10-mrpc <dig> in  <dig> cases .

we observed  <dig> patterns of frua-his <dig> and his10-mrpc <dig> binding. figure  <dig> shows an example of each pattern. as an example of the first pattern, frua-his <dig> alone bound weakly to the mxan_ <dig> upstream region . the combination of frua-his <dig> and his10-mrpc <dig> produced a slow-migrating complex more abundantly than could be accounted for by binding of each protein alone , providing evidence for cooperative binding. at a much lower concentration of his10-mrpc <dig> alone, a single complex was observed . this complex was not observed when frua-his <dig> was added . rather, two complexes were observed, one that co-migrated with the complex produced by frua-his <dig> alone  and the other migrating more slowly , which may be due to cooperative binding of the two proteins. a similar pattern of weak binding by frua-his <dig> alone, and a slow-migrating complex produced more abundantly by the combination of frua-his <dig> and his10-mrpc <dig>  than could be accounted for by binding of each protein alone , was observed for the pkta <dig>  mxan_ <dig>  mxan_ <dig>  and mrpa regions .figure  <dig> 
patterns of mrpc <dig> and frua binding to candidate genes from chip-seq. for the indicated genes, approximately 200 bp of dna surrounding a peak from the chip-seq analysis was amplified by pcr with 32p-labeled primers. the mxan_ <dig> probe contained only the upstream predicted mrpc <dig> binding site. the dna probes  were incubated with his10-mrpc <dig>  and/or frua-his <dig>  as indicated , and subjected to emsas. a lower concentration of his10-mrpc <dig>  and frua-his <dig>  was used in some experiments. filled arrowheads pointing leftward or rightward are inferred to indicate complexes with one or more frua-his <dig> bound, respectively. brackets and open arrowheads indicate novel or more abundant complexes produced by the combination of proteins than by either protein alone. panels with a narrower separation were analyzed on the same gel, with intervening lanes removed.



a slightly different pattern was observed for the bsga, mxan_ <dig>  and chew6a regions . these upstream regions were bound strongly by frua-his <dig> alone, producing a complex whose migration distance suggested more than  <dig> frua-his <dig> was bound. when his10-mrpc <dig> was added, a slow-migrating complex was produced more abundantly than could be accounted for by binding of each protein alone, providing evidence for cooperative binding. at a 2-fold lower concentration of frua-his <dig> alone, no complex was observed for the bsga region  and a complex suggestive of  <dig> frua-his <dig> bound was barely detectable for the mxan_ <dig> . addition of a 10-fold lower concentration of his10-mrpc <dig> to the 2-fold lower concentration of frua-his <dig> produced slightly more complex than could be accounted for by binding of each protein alone , consistent with cooperative binding, but surprisingly a novel, slow-migrating complex was observed only for the mxan_ <dig> region.

a third pattern was observed for the mrpc upstream region. frua-his <dig> alone failed to produce a distinct complex , but in combination with his10-mrpc <dig>  a slow-migrating complex was produced more abundantly than could be accounted for by binding of each protein alone , suggestive of cooperative binding. at a 10-fold lower concentration of his10-mrpc <dig>  more slow-migrating complex was produced when frua-his <dig> was added , consistent with cooperative binding. likewise, frua-his <dig> alone failed to produce a distinct complex with the mxan_ <dig>  frzs, pkn <dig>  and rpoe <dig> regions, but there was evidence of cooperative binding in combination with his10-mrpc <dig> .

the fourth pattern, failure of frua-his <dig> alone to bind and lack of cooperative binding, was observed for the regions upstream of soca <dig>  and pila .

all together, we found evidence of cooperative binding of mrpc <dig> and frua in  <dig> of  <dig> regions tested . adding this to previous studies that provided evidence for cooperative binding in  <dig> of  <dig> regions examined , it appears that cooperative binding of mrpc <dig> and frua is widespread in the m. xanthus genome.

discussion
our chip-seq analysis, consensus binding site identification, and emsa experiments provide strong evidence for the conclusion that mrpc and mrpc <dig> bind to promoter regions of hundreds of developmentally-regulated genes in m. xanthus, in many cases cooperatively with frua. to our knowledge, this is the first report of genome-wide binding analysis for a transcription factor in m. xanthus. while it was gratifying to find some of the known targets of mrpc among the sites identified by our chip-seq analysis, others were missed, so undoubtedly there remain more mrpc binding sites to be found. despite missing some of the functional mrpc binding sites, and finding others located far from the nearest promoter region and therefore perhaps not functional for transcriptional regulation, we found a large number of putative mrpc binding sites in promoter regions and we verified binding of mrpc <dig> in vitro in all  <dig> cases tested, so many of the putative mrpc binding sites very likely regulate transcription. moreover, in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases, and in  <dig> cases examined previously, mrpc <dig> appeared to bind cooperatively with frua to dna, suggesting that many genes are coordinately regulated by these two transcription factors.

a large number of putative mrpc binding sites
the number of putative mrpc binding sites revealed by our chip-seq analysis was surprisingly large. typically, genome-wide binding analyses  have yielded about an order of magnitude lower number of putative binding sites for bacterial transcription factors . the m. xanthus genome is larger than most bacterial genomes, but it is only about twice as large as those of well-studied model organisms like e. coli, bacillus subtilis, and caulobacter crescentus, so genome size can only partly account for the unexpectedly large number of putative mrpc binding sites. since mrpc was proposed to be a member of the crp family based on sequence similarity  <cit>  and since mrpc recognizes a similar consensus sequence as e. coli crp , it may be useful to compare genome-wide studies of e. coli crp. identification of the crp regulon using in vitro and in vivo transcriptional profiling revealed  <dig> up-regulated operons and  <dig> down-regulated operons  <cit> . chip-chip analysis yielded only  <dig> high-occupancy sites, but many thousands of weak sites scattered throughout the e. coli chromosome  <cit> , possibly related to the > <dig>  lower-affinity sites predicted by computational analysis  <cit> . follow-up experiments on  <dig> previously uncharacterized targets identified by the genomic approaches  <cit>  demonstrated crp binding in vitro in  <dig> cases and transcriptional regulation by crp in vivo in only  <dig> cases  <cit> . these results highlight the complexities of genome-wide studies. each approach, including chip-seq  <cit> , has limitations that can generate false positives, and follow-up experiments like emsas and transcript analysis have limitations as well. nevertheless, many of the  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites identified by our chip-seq analysis are likely to function in transcriptional regulation since 1) they exhibit high positional conservation across two replicates, 2) several known targets of mrpc were found, 3) they are preferentially located in predicted non-coding regions and close to predicted tscs, 4) those in promoter regions are greatly over-represented near developmentally up-regulated genes and near the first gene of operons we deemed potentially interesting since they are involved in motility, signaling, or gene expression that may play a role in development, 5) all  <dig> sites we tested were bound by mrpc <dig> in vitro, 6) bioinformatic analysis of the sites identified a consensus sequence that was highly predictive of mrpc <dig> binding in vitro .

putative mrpc binding sites that are located far from promoter regions are less likely to participate in transcriptional regulation. of the  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites,  <dig> were not located between - <dig> and + <dig> relative to a predicted tsc. most of these sites are in coding regions. whether these sites reflect a role of mrpc in organizing the chromosome within the cell, as has been speculated for e. coli crp  <cit>  and b. subtilis spoiiid  <cit> , remains to be seen.

much more work is needed to explore the functionality of the  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites revealed by our chip-seq analysis. in addition, there undoubtedly remain more functional mrpc binding sites to be found. only half of the previously known mrpc binding sites were detected as significant peaks in both replicates of our chip-seq analysis . the majority of the putative mrpc binding sites we tested, including the  <dig> most highly ranked, appeared to be bound by more than one mrpc <dig> , suggesting that multiple binding sites contributed to detectability in our chip-seq analysis. presumably, the affinity of mrpc for individual sites was another major contributor to detectability. beyond these issues of detectability, it is very likely that mrpc binding changes during the course of development, so chip-seq at times other than 18 h post-starvation would very likely reveal additional mrpc binding sites as well.

mrpc is implicated as a transcriptional activator of hundreds of developmental genes, especially protein kinases and transcription factors
of the  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites identified by our chip-seq analysis,  <dig> are located in promoter regions, which we defined as the regions between - <dig> and + <dig> relative to predicted tscs, and in  <dig> cases there are presumably divergent promoters, so the  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites are located in the promoter regions of  <dig> genes . of course, there is uncertainty in predicting tscs and in most cases the transcription start site is unknown. despite these uncertainties,  <dig> of the putative mrpc binding sites are located in the promoter region of a gene up-regulated during development , based on the dna microarray experiments  <cit> ; a very significant over-representation . in addition,  <dig> of the sites in promoter regions of known mrpc targets   and another  <dig> in the promoter regions of genes directly involved in fruiting body formation   were not detected as up-regulated in the microarray experiments but have been shown to be up-regulated during development by other approaches . these approaches and an additional microarray study have identified  <dig> other genes  that are up-regulated during development and have a putative mrpc binding site nearby, so mrpc is implicated as a transcriptional activator of at least  <dig> genes during development . we anticipate this number will increase as more transcriptomic methods such as rna-seq are used to study m. xanthus development and as more developmental genes are analyzed individually.figure  <dig> 
analysis of putative mrpc binding sites with respect to up- or down-regulated developmental genes and their functions. putative mrpc binding sites are listed in additional file  <dig>  up- or down-regulated developmental genes identified in microarray experiments  <cit>  are listed in additional file  <dig>  and additional genes discussed are described in the text . the table lists the number of up- or down-regulated genes in each functional category and lists those characterized . genes in bold were bound in their promoter region by his10-mrpc <dig> and genes that appeared to be bound cooperatively by his10-mrpc <dig> and frua-his <dig> are also underlined . the pila <cit>  and epsl <cit>  genes are listed twice because they are first up-regulated and then down-regulated during development. the soca <dig> gene is listed twice because it is down-regulated in rod-shaped cells and up-regulated in sporulating cells during development  <cit> .



among the  <dig> genes implicated to be activated by mrpc,  <dig> are located immediately upstream of genes known or predicted to code for pks . in addition, one promoter is located immediately upstream of a gene predicted to code for an rr  that may be co-transcribed in an operon with mxan_ <dig>  which is predicted to code for an stpk . presumably, some of these pks sense extracellular signals from the environment and from co-developing m. xanthus cells, while others sense intracellular cues; however, none of the signals are known. nevertheless, our finding that mrpc likely up-regulates transcription of a large number of pks suggests that an important function of mrpc is to heighten the sensory awareness of cells during the developmental process. in striking contrast, our results do not implicate mrpc in down-regulation of any pk .

among the  <dig>  pks whose transcription is likely up-regulated by mrpc,  <dig> have been characterized to some extent . mutations in pkn1
 <cit> , pkn6
 <cit> , pkn9
 <cit> , sdek
 <cit> , pska12
 <cit> , hpk <dig> and hpk37
 <cit> , impair development, but the phosphorylation target proteins of these pks have not been reported, although sdek is known to be required for aggregation and activation of c-signal-dependent genes  <cit>  . asgd has been implicated in a-signal production early in development  <cit>  , but its target is also unknown. the target of pkn <dig> is pkn <dig>  and pkn <dig> phosphorylates mrpc, negatively regulating its accumulation during growth and development  <cit> , and greatly reducing its binding to dna  <cit> . therefore, up-regulation of pkn <dig> by mrpc activates a potential negative feedback loop to diminish mrpc activity if the  signal to which pkn <dig> responds appears . likewise, up-regulation of espa, espc, and pkta <dig> by mrpc activates a potential negative feedback loop . in this case, espa and espc are hybrid hpks with a receiver domain, and espa is known to phosphorylate both its own receiver domain and that of espc  <cit> . pkta <dig> appears to act together with pkta <dig> and espb, and the complex may in turn interact with espa  <cit> . the output of this complicated signaling system is to negatively regulate mrpc by increasing its proteolytic turnover  <cit> . in contrast, up-regulation of the mrpab operon by mrpc activates a potential positive feedback loop, since phosphorylated mrpb appears to activate transcription of mrpc
 <cit>  . however, it has been proposed that mrpb is phosphorylated by an unknown hpk and that mrpa, rather than acting as an hpk, dephosphorylates mrpb. hence, up-regulation of mrpa by mrpc may also activate a potential negative feedback loop . multiple mechanisms to negatively regulate mrpc activity appear to be important for preventing premature sporulation outside of fruiting bodies  <cit> . some of these mechanisms might also permit developing cells to halt commitment to sporulation if nutrients reappear  <cit> .

among the  <dig> genes implicated to be activated by mrpc,  <dig> are located immediately upstream of genes known or predicted to code for transcription factors . in addition to frua and mrpc,  <dig> others have been characterized to some extent . sigc negatively regulates development  <cit> , but how it does so is unknown. actb is part of the ebp cascade module  <cit>  that plays several crucial roles in development , but whether the putative mrpc binding site located at - <dig> relative to the predicted actb tsc  contributes to the observed up-regulation of the actabcd operon  <cit>  remains to be seen. asgb  is needed for a-signal production during development  <cit>   and asgb appears to be essential for growth  <cit> . expression of an asgb-lacz fusion increased about twofold by  <dig>  h into development  <cit> , possibly due to mrpc binding to a site located at - <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of asgb . xre <dig>  regulates genes involved in phase variation  <cit> . a putative mrpc binding site is located at - <dig> relative to the predicted mxan_ <dig> tsc . however, the significance of the implied up-regulation by mrpc is unclear since disruption of mxan_ <dig> had little effect on development  <cit> .

examination of a second microarray study that identified  <dig> genes that are up-regulated at least  <dig> -fold by 12 h into development  <cit>  revealed  <dig> more genes whose promoters might be activated by mrpc. four of these are predicted to code for transcription factors  and the fifth codes for c-signal . therefore, mrpc is implicated to up-regulate  <dig> promoters that are located immediately upstream of genes known or predicted to code for transcription factors  . among the  <dig> additional genes predicted to code for transcription factors, mxan_ <dig>  was on our list of potentially interesting genes  because a null mutant made fruiting bodies of abnormal shape under certain conditions in a previous study  <cit> . mxan_ <dig> appears to code for an ebp involved in nitrogen sensing during development. mxan_ <dig>  is also predicted to code for an ebp but a null mutant showed no developmental defect  <cit> . characterization of mxan_ <dig> and  <dig> has not been reported.

mrpc is implicated as a direct activator or repressor of genes involved in signal production, spore formation, protein fate, and motility during development
three of the up-regulated genes mentioned above are involved in extracellular signal production. asgd and asgb are a putative pk and transcription factor, respectively, involved in production of extracellular a-signal early in development  . csga appears to be n-terminally truncated at the cell surface to produce c-signal  . the putative mrpc binding site located at + <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of mxan_ <dig>  is at - <dig> relative to that of the divergent csga gene. while this site is slightly beyond the - <dig> cutoff we used to define likely regulatory sites, full expression of a csga-lacz fusion during development required dna extending to - <dig>  <cit> . therefore, mrpc bound to the site in mxan_ <dig> might boost csga expression.

interestingly, other genes involved in c-signal production might also be up-regulated by mrpc. mxan_ <dig> codes for popd, an inhibitor of the protease  that cleaves csga at the cell surface  <cit>  . the popcd operon was found to be up-regulated in microarray experiments  <cit> . there is a putative mrpc binding site located at - <dig> relative to the predicted popd tsc , so mxan_ <dig> is among the up-regulated and potentially interesting genes with a putative mrpc binding located between - <dig> and + <dig> relative to its predicted tsc . this site is within the popc coding region at + <dig> relative to its predicted tsc. intriguingly, there are three other putative mrpc binding sites within popc at + <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig> relative to its predicted tsc . whether these sites account for the observed up-regulation of popcd during development remains to be tested. another gene involved in c-signal production and therefore on our list of potentially interesting genes  is mxan_ <dig>  which codes for ftshd, a protease important for degradation of popd  <cit>  . this proteolysis is regulated by ppgpp signaling and it releases popc for secretion to the cell surface where it cleaves csga to produce c-signal  <cit> . expression of ftshd increases early in development  <cit> . interestingly, mxan_ <dig> has a putative mrpc binding site located at - <dig> relative to its predicted tcs . therefore, mrpc might boost c-signal production by activating transcription of both csga and components of the proteolytic cascade that acts on csga to produce c-signal.

the bsga gene  codes for a protease that is believed to be involved in production of b-signal during development  <cit>  and was therefore on our list of potentially interesting genes . our chip-seq analysis identified a putative mrpc binding site located at - <dig> relative to the predicted bsga tsc . the start site of transcription has not been mapped, but expression of a lacz fusion to bsga  increased gradually during development  <cit> . the increase was less than twofold, so it is not surprising that it was not detected in microarray experiments. nevertheless, the results suggest that mrpc might weakly activate transcription of bsga, which in addition to its role in b-signal production also is necessary for production of mrpc <dig>  <cit>  .

the esgab locus  codes for the subunits of a branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase implicated in production of e-signal during development  <cit> . the two genes likely form an operon and were on our list of potentially interesting genes . the upstream mxan_ <dig> gene was found to be down-regulated during development in microarray experiments  <cit> . relative to the predicted tsc of this gene, we found a putative mrpc binding site located at + <dig> , so mxan_ <dig> is one of the down-regulated and potentially interesting genes in additional file  <dig> . we infer that mrpc might repress transcription of the esgab operon, inhibiting e-signal production . the esg enzyme appears to be involved in synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids  <cit>  that contribute to formation of unusual iso-branched ether lipids  <cit> , which function as energy storage compounds and signals during development  <cit> . since mxan_ <dig>   <dig> , the likely co-transcribed  <dig>  and/or the separately transcribed  <dig>  had been proposed to be involved in ether lipid synthesis  <cit> , these genes were on our list of potentially interesting genes . mxan_ <dig> and soca <dig> have putative mrpc binding sites located at + <dig> and - <dig> relative to their predicted tscs, respectively , suggesting these genes might be regulated by mrpc. the soca locus was initially identified by mutations that partially suppress the developmental defect of a csga mutant  <cit> . the mutations cause overexpression of soca1
 <cit> , but how this rescues defective c-signaling is unclear  <cit> . expression of soca <dig> is down-regulated in rod-shaped cells and up-regulated in sporulating cells during development  <cit> . recently, a cluster of five genes  that likely form an operon has been shown to be responsible for ether lipid synthesis  <cit> . interestingly, a putative mrpc binding site is located at + <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of mxan_ <dig> , and this gene was found to be down-regulated during development in microarray experiments  <cit>  . therefore, mrpc might repress transcription of the mxan_1531- <dig> operon . all together, our results suggest that mrpc down-regulates e-signal production during development.

several genes that regulate ppgpp-signaling are candidates for direct regulation by mrpc. in addition to its central role in c-signaling, csga induces the stringent response at the onset of development  <cit> . hence, up-regulation of csga by mrpc as described above may increase ppgpp signaling . in contrast, soce inhibits the stringent response  <cit>  . early in development, the stringent response negatively regulates soce and positively regulates csga
 <cit> . the soce gene  was on our list of potentially interesting genes  and a putative mrpc binding site was found at - <dig> relative to the predicted tsc . whether mrpc reinforces down-regulation of soce from this site remains to be explored. like soce, nsd inhibits ppgpp accumulation when nutrients are available ; however, the nsd gene is up-regulated at the onset of development  <cit> . a putative mrpc binding site was found at + <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of nsd  .

our results implicate mrpc in the up-regulation of a major spore protein, prw   <cit> , and in the regulation of several proteins important for spore formation . a putative mrpc binding site was found at - <dig> relative to the predicted prw  tsc . nfs proteins are involved in deposition of the polysaccharide spore coat  <cit> . the locations of two putative mrpc binding sites upstream of the nfs operon  and one within it, upstream of the last gene, nfsh, were noted in the results. here, we note that a sizable gap between nfsg and nfsh could accommodate a suboperonic promoter regulated by mrpc from the site upstream of nfsh. likewise, a suboperonic promoter could be regulated by mrpc from a putative binding site located at + <dig> relative to the predicted exoe tsc  in the nine-gene exo operon  , whose products are also involved in deposition of the polysaccharide spore coat  <cit> . the exo operon is up-regulated during development  <cit>  by frua , which binds upstream of the operon promoter  <cit> . sap proteins are small acid-soluble proteins important for resistance of spores to ultraviolet light  <cit> . the sapa  and sapb  genes were reported to be down- and up-regulated, respectively, during development in microarray experiments  <cit>  . putative mrpc binding sites were found at - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of sapa and sapb, respectively .

our results implicate mrpc in the down- or up-regulation of genes involved in protein fate and motility during development, but most of these genes have not been studied much . of the  <dig> genes  predicted to control the fate of other proteins, shown to be down-regulated during development in microarray experiments  <cit>  , and having a putative mrpc binding site located between - <dig> and + <dig> relative to the predicted tcs, none to our knowledge have been knocked out to test for a developmental defect. on the other hand, most of the genes involved in motility were identified as such by mutational analysis, but only a few are known to be down-regulated  or up-regulated  during development, based on microarray experiments  <cit>  . two others have been studied in some detail. pila codes for pilin, the structural component of type iv pili, which are needed for s motility  <cit> . the pila gene  is first up-regulated and then down-regulated during development  <cit> . two putative mrpc binding sites, located at - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the predicted pila tsc , might participate in its developmental regulation. the che <dig> operon  is up-regulated during development and its products form a chemosensory system that regulates s motility  <cit> . a putative mrpc binding site located at - <dig> relative to the predicted chew4a tsc  might mediate the observed up-regulation. in addition to these  <dig> genes or operons, another  <dig> involved in motility have a putative mrpc binding site located between - <dig> and + <dig> relative to their predicted tcs  but either developmental regulation was missed in the microarray experiments or mrpc does not regulate these genes. noteworthy among these genes or operons are the che <dig>  and che <dig>  operons, which code for chemosensory systems in which mutations cause defects in s motility and development  <cit> . putative mrpc binding sites were found at - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the predicted tscs of mxan_ <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, the first gene of each operon . although the che <dig> cluster of genes  has not been analyzed thoroughly, a mutation in chea <dig>  caused premature development  <cit> . a putative mrpc binding site is located at - <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of the first gene  of this putative operon . also worth noting are two putative mrpc binding sites in the vicinity of epsl , a gene noted above as down-regulated during development in microarray experiments  <cit>  . a putative mrpc binding site located at + <dig> relative to the predicted epsl tcs  might account for the down-regulation. the second putative mrpc binding site is located at - <dig> relative to the predicted tsc of epsk  . the epsk gene is likely co-transcribed with epsl . both genes are implicated in s motility  <cit>  and in efflux of heavy metal ions  <cit> . expression of epsl  increased early in development and then decreased  <cit> , so mrpc might be involved in this regulation. alternatively or in addition, mrpc binding to the same site might regulate the divergent promoter of mxan_ <dig> , which is likely co-transcribed with nla <dig> . both of these genes are also implicated in s motility  <cit> , with nla <dig> being an ebp  <cit> .

binding of mrpc and frua to dna
bioinformatic analysis of the  <dig> top-ranked putative mrpc binding sites revealed a motif that strongly resembles one of two consensus sequences for mrpc binding proposed previously  <cit> . the motif is the imperfect palindrome tgtyn8rac . we tried to use this motif to identify putative mrpc binding sites genome-wide, but parameters that retained known sites yielded large numbers of predicted sites. our bioinformatic analysis of the top  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites did not identify motif  <dig> , which was proposed previously based on six sequences in the mrpc promoter region to which mrpc bound  <cit> . perhaps motif  <dig> is too short and too degenerate to be detected by our analysis. we thought our analysis might uncover a motif related to frua binding, since frua binds cooperatively with mrpc at several sites . a consensus sequence for binding of the frua dna-binding domain, gggyrn4-6yggg has been proposed  <cit> , but meme discovered no motif resembling this sequence in the vicinity of the top  <dig> putative mrpc binding sites. it is possible that cooperative interactions with mrpc allow frua to bind to sequences dissimilar to the proposed consensus.

our finding that his10-mrpc and his10-mrpc <dig> bind to a region upstream of the frua promoter with similar affinity is surprising . a previous comparison of the two proteins suggested that mrpc <dig> has 8-fold and 4-fold higher affinity for the frua and mrpc promoter regions, respectively  <cit> . although we do not understand this discrepancy, our finding does not preclude an important role for the conversion of mrpc to mrpc <dig> during development. mrpc <dig> cannot be phosphorylated by pkn <dig>  and mrpc-p has been reported to be unstable  <cit>  and to bind dna poorly  <cit> . however, it was found recently that under certain conditions of development, mrpc <dig> accumulation is diminished at least temporarily with no discernible impact on development  <cit> . the precise roles of mrpc and mrpc <dig> during development remain to be defined.

mrpc <dig> bound to dna containing a putative mrpc binding site in every case we tested. these cases included top-ranked chip-seq peaks as well as low-ranked peaks . dna corresponding to all the top-ranked peaks, as well as several lower-ranked peaks, produced multiple shifted complexes in emsas, indicative of multiple mrpc <dig> binding sites . presumably, as noted above, both the number and affinity of binding sites contribute to detectability and hence rank in the chip-seq analysis. binding of other proteins is also expected to affect detectability, negatively if the two proteins compete for binding to overlapping sites, or positively if the two proteins bind cooperatively. frua binds cooperatively with mrpc <dig> at several sites . in one case, the two proteins appear to compete for binding to overlapping sites  <cit> .

mrpc <dig> bound to dna sequences matching the motif identified by our bioinformatic analysis  in all  <dig> cases tested . in one case, two matches to the motif were found near one of the putative mrpc binding sites . both sequences matching the motif were bound by mrpc <dig>  but the sequence in between and containing only half of each match to the motif was not bound . we conclude that the motif is highly predictive of mrpc <dig> binding. on the other hand, mrpc <dig> also binds to dna sequences that do not match the motif very well. several 200-bp dna fragments containing a putative mrpc binding site but with no strong match to the motif nevertheless were bound by one or more mrpc <dig>  and several fragments with one match to the motif were bound by two or more mrpc <dig> . in some cases, cooperative interactions between mrpc <dig> dimers might facilitate binding, although this remains to be tested.

we found evidence for cooperative binding of mrpc <dig> and frua in  <dig> of  <dig> cases tested . together with previous work on five promoter regions that are up-regulated during development sites , the data strongly suggest that cooperative binding of the two transcription factors is a pervasive regulatory mechanism during m. xanthus development. this cooperativity was proposed to allow cells to monitor both aggregation and nutritional status before committing to sporulation  <cit> . frua activity appears to increase in response to c-signaling as cells aggregate and become aligned in nascent fruiting bodies . recently, mrpc was shown to be sensitive to nutrient-regulated proteolysis before and during the critical period of commitment to sporulation  <cit> . only if cells are starving and close-packed in mounds are both mrpc and frua active enough to permit transcription of genes that commit cells to spore formation, resulting in mature fruiting bodies.

several patterns of cooperative mrpc <dig> and frua binding were observed. in the first pattern, there was little binding of frua alone, but in combination with mrpc <dig> much more of a slower-migrating complex was formed than with mrpc <dig> alone, although mrpc <dig> alone bound strongly . in these cases, bound mrpc <dig> appeared to enhance the binding of frua. except for the site within mxan_ <dig>  these sites are upstream of predicted tscs of genes up-regulated during development and/or known to be involved in development . in the second pattern, each protein bound strongly alone, and frua appeared to be binding to multiple sites . frua may be binding cooperatively to these sites, although this remains to be tested. the strong binding by both proteins made it difficult to determine whether cooperative binding was occurring at our standard protein concentrations. by testing lower concentrations of the two proteins, there appeared to be more than simply additive binding . in the case of the bsga upstream region, we expected to see a novel, slow-migrating complex in lane  <dig> of figure  <dig>  due to binding of mrpc <dig> and frua. instead, more of a complex that co-migrated with the complex produced by mrpc <dig> alone was observed. we speculate that the complex with both proteins bound is unstable or migrates aberrantly. in any case, regions exhibiting the second pattern of binding may rely on cooperative interactions between mrpc <dig> and frua early in development when their concentrations are low, but not later when their concentrations are high. of the three regions exhibiting this pattern, bsga is weakly up-regulated during development and codes for a protease involved in b-signaling  <cit> , mxan_ <dig> is down-regulated during development  <cit> , and chew6a is the first gene of an operon that codes for a chemosensory system involved in s motility and development  <cit> . in the third pattern, frua alone failed to produce a distinct complex, but there was evidence of cooperative binding in combination with mrpc <dig> . this pattern is similar to the first pattern, in which bound mrpc <dig> appears to enhance the binding of frua. notable among the genes exhibiting the third pattern are mrpc itself and pkn <dig>  hence, our results for the first time implicate frua in feedback loops that regulate mrpc.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that mrpc binds to the promoter regions of hundreds of developmentally-regulated genes of m. xanthus at 18 h poststarvation. in many cases, mrpc likely binds cooperatively with frua, subjecting transcription of target genes to both nutritional and morphological cues. the implied targets of activation by mrpc alone or in combination with frua include  <dig> pks,  <dig> transcription factors,  <dig> genes involved in production of a-, c-, and ppgpp-signals,  <dig> genes involved in spore formation, and  <dig> genes involved in motility . other genes involved in signal production  or motility, as well as  <dig> that control the fate of other proteins, may be repressed by mrpc. the profound effects of mrpc on developmental gene expression, including activation of frua transcription and combinatorial control with frua of downstream targets and feedback loops, predict that many indirect effects will be observed in comparative transcriptomic analysis of wild type with mrpc and frua mutants. care in interpreting such data will be necessary. this type of further work would be most useful if done in a way that identified transcript 5’ ends  genome-wide, which is possible using rna-seq approaches  <cit> . performing chip-seq analysis for both mrpc and frua at additional times poststarvation is another clear direction for future experiments. this first report of genome-wide binding analysis for a transcription factor in m. xanthus yielded a plethora of predictions about the role of mrpc in regulating developmental genes, which will need to be tested.
