BACKGROUND
insertion elements, the simplest bacterial transposons, are short dna sequences  carrying only genetic information related to their transposition and its regulation  <cit> . is elements are capable of transposition into many sites within and between bacterial chromosomes and extra-chromosomal elements. the movement of is elements can cause activation or silencing of adjacent genes  <cit> ; chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions, inversions and insertions are also common consequences of is element activity  <cit> . due to diverse genetic effects associated with the activity of insertion elements, developing tools to identify and map the location of these dna sequences in bacterial genomes is essential to advance our understanding of the role is elements play in gene regulation and genome plasticity.

mapping insertion elements in microbial genomes is important for several reasons. first, the distribution and location of insertion elements in a genome is a potent tool to track the evolution of a bacterial strain  <cit> . second, is elements are often used as molecular markers to distinguish between closely related bacterial strains. this approach is helpful in epidemiological studies in which the presence and location of a particular insertion element have been used as a marker to track the epidemiology of microbial pathogens  <cit> .

although the information about the genomic locations of is elements is available in public sequence databases, by definition, the locations of mobile elements may vary from strain to strain and within the population of an individual strain  <cit> , and  <cit> . thus we need a tool that would not be solely dependent on the existing information about the location of insertion elements, but instead would allow de novo mapping of the sequences.

a variety of molecular techniques have been used to map insertion elements in bacteria. these include southern hybridizations, inverse pcr, and vectorette pcr  <cit> ; and  <cit> . inverse pcr and southern hybridizations are very laborious techniques that require further sample processing to determine the location of the insertion sequences. recently, vectorette pcr has been described as rapid and efficient method to map is elements in the e. coli genome  <cit> . dna microarrays provide a powerful alternative to the gel-based techniques and allow reliable determination of relative abundances of individual rna or dna species in complex mixtures. most microarray applications attempt to assess the relative abundance of individual nucleic acids species by labeling it  directly, in sequence-independent manner  <cit>  and  <cit> . however, the identification of neighboring sequences using microarrays relies on a sequence-dependent labeling by primer extension from a known sequence  <cit>  and  <cit> . raychaudhuri  <cit>  developed and later applied  <cit>  an algorithm using non-parametric discriminant analysis to predict the location of is <dig> element within the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome from microarray data. their algorithm requires two sets of feature training examples: insertion sites and non-insertion sites and the authors used known insertions sites across multiple experiments to generate the examples. however in most real life cases, we do not have multiple experiments and do not know the sites of insertions or non-insertion sites in advance. in this paper, we propose a simple but reliable algorithm to predict the genomic location of insertion dna sequences based on microarray data without using the prior knowledge about the location of mobile elements.

most applications of spotted cdna microarrays rely on two-color competitive dna hybridization to assess the relative abundance of nucleic acid species represented on the array  <cit> . often, however, it is quite difficult to choose an adequate biologically meaningful reference for the two-color hybridization. in such cases especially, the reference serves only to compound the error in the ratio calculation. in this article we investigate the applicability of single channel hybridization for making biologically relevant inferences from microarray data.

we applied the tools presented herein to map the locations of the is <dig> elements in the genome of escherichia coli k <dig>  we observed heterogeneity in localization of the elements within a population of the strain. the biological implications of this finding are discussed.

RESULTS
genome-wide mapping of is <dig> elements
individual clones of the e. coli mg <dig> were obtained by plating an atcc culture of the strain whose complete genome sequence was published in  <dig>  <cit> . liquid cultures of single colonies were used as frozen stocks for subsequent experiments. we carried out mapping experiments with two sets of biological replicates, where each set is represented by several independently grown colonies from two separately frozen stocks of bacteria. we designated these stocks 'a' and 'b', and the sets of biological replicates were a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  we also carried out a set of control experiments designated as c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  where no neighbor sequences should've been detected because purified transposon dna was used as a template in the probe preparation. the is mapping data presented in this paper is publicly available in the ncbi geo database under the following accession numbers: gse <dig> 

we used false discovery rate plots to decide the cut-off for claiming the significant genes for median rank statistic. figure  <dig> shows that the false discovery rate increases much more rapidly in the control compared to the experiment as the number of claimed positive genes increases. this observation is consistent with our hypothesis that we should find more true positive genes in experiments  than in controls . for the same number of claimed positive genes, the fdr for stock 'a' was somewhat lower than for 'b': when claiming top  <dig> genes as significant genes, the fdr for stock 'a' was about  <dig>  and for stock 'b' was about  <dig> . we regarded these false discovery rates  as acceptable and we set the cut-off for selecting significant genes at the top  <dig> genes.

to determine whether there is any relationship between the proximity of a neighbour to the is <dig> element and its intensity we constructed "rank vs. distance" plots for all  <dig> known is <dig> positions in the genome . the open circles represent the neighbouring orfs and the solid circles correspond to is <dig> elements. figure 2a demonstrates that most of the genes in immediate proximity to is <dig> elements have consistently low ranks, with very few outliers with high ranks. we obtained similar results for both stocks 'a' and 'b' . the "rank vs. distance" plots in figure 2b clearly demonstrate that there is no association between the rank and the distance in the control. while the ranks of is <dig> elements are very low, the ranks of expected neighbours are high and random.

 <dig> genes predicted as neighbours of is <dig> elements by median rank for stock 'a' are listed in table  <dig>  they include  <dig> genes that are likely to be false positives as there are no neighbours of those genes in the list of top 100;  <dig> pairs of possible significant genes with one neighbour present on the list,  <dig> groups of likely true positive genes with at least  <dig> neighbours on the top ranking list. among  <dig> groups of significant genes ,  <dig> groups are expected neighbours of is <dig> elements based on the genome sequence data. only one group of genes including motb, mota, flhc, flhd, yecg, otsa, otsb are not known neighbours of an is <dig>  it is highly unlikely to find  <dig> neighbouring genes as significant genes by chance alone. table  <dig> lists  <dig> genes predicted as neighbours of is <dig> elements by median rank method for stock 'b'. among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were stand alone genes without a single neighbour on the gene list. we designated them as false significant genes. we identified  <dig> groups of genes  as significant genes, with at least  <dig> neighbours appearing on the list. among these  <dig> groups,  <dig> were known neighbours of is <dig> elements. only one group of three genes  was not previously known to be in the vicinity of an is <dig>  compared to stock 'a', the number of false significant genes identified as neighbours of is elements in stock 'b' is much higher, which is consistent with the observed differences in false discovery rates . however, we could identify all known  <dig> locations of is <dig> in both stocks. the most pronounced difference between two stocks, in terms of a probability of finding the is element in a new location by chance, was the apparent presence of the transposon sequence proximal to the flhdc/yecg group of genes.

we confirmed the presence of an is <dig> element in the flhdc/yecg intergenic region by pcr. a  <dig> bp pcr product was obtained with primers specific for the flhdc/yecg intergenic region and chromosomal dna from stock 'a' as a template. in contrast, when the same primers were used with dna from stock 'b', only a  <dig> bp dna fragment was obtained . further dna sequence analysis confirmed the presence of is <dig> upstream of flhdc, in 'a', while no insertion elements were identified upstream of flhdc in 'b'. the inverted repeats of the is <dig> insertion element were located  <dig> bp upstream of the reported flhdc transcription start site  <cit>  . the sequence of the inverted repeats was 100% conserved relative to the reported is <dig> gene sequence  <cit> . in addition, a 4-bp target duplication site  was found flanking the inverted repeats at the is <dig> insertion sites. these experiments showed that as predicted by our analysis, an is <dig> element was present in the flhdc /yecg region.

we also examined one of the transposon locations that was likely to be a false significant as it has been suggested by our statistical analysis. pcr analysis of the flip neighbourhood was done with primers specific for the gene regions of flio/ flip and flip/fliq. the size of the pcr products obtained  was the expected size for the gene regions examined based on genome sequence data  <cit>  . this indicates that there is no is <dig> element adjacent to flip and that our assertion that genes present on the list of top ranking candidates without neighbours are likely to be false calls is correct.

thus the predicted neighbours of an is <dig> element were consistent with the verification experiments results and the sequence data. if we assume  <dig> is <dig> insertion sites based on sequence data and the flhdc/yecg site based on verification experiments are the only insertion sites in the chromosome of 'a', then there are 11* <dig>  =  <dig> neighbours. assuming all other genes are non-neighbours, and we designated  <dig> significant genes as predicted neighbours, then the sensitivity of our algorithm is 80/ <dig> =  <dig> %. specificity is  <dig> and false discovery rate is  <dig>  since all predicted genes are true neighbours.

biological implications of the presence of an is <dig> element upstream of flhdc
so far we have demonstrated that our method allowed determining genome-wide distribution of insertion elements and that our analysis is sensitive enough for the purposes of differential localization of transposons in genomes of e. coli isolates. differential localization of insertion elements maybe reflective of different history of isolates or of heterogeneity in a cell population. we confirmed that isolates 'a' and 'b' are indistinguishable by genetic fingerpriniting  <cit>  and by comparative genomic hybridization on arrays  <cit>   and that original population of an atcc strain was split almost one-to-one between an 'a' type cells containing an is <dig> element in the vicinity of flhdc/yecg and a 'b' type without an element. next, we examined whether two types of cells that we distinguished by a location of an is <dig> marker may have phenotypic differences associated with an insertion element. we directly compared expression profiles of two isolates using whole-genome dna microarrays. following the lowess smoothing and anova normalization  <cit> , we identified  <dig> genes at a false discovery rate of less than one gene per list  <cit> , whose transcripts appeared to be differentially abundant between the two isolates <the gene expression data presented in this paper is publicly available in the ncbi geo database under the following accession numbers: gse2694>. one functional group dominated the list of significant genes:  <dig> genes classified as being involved in motility and chemotaxis "consumed" 90% of the variance of the entire list of significant genes. on average the flagella genes in isolate 'a' were 9-fold more abundant than in isolate 'b' . the levels of expression of flhd and flhc, genes encoding a master-regulator of the motility and chemotaxis regulon and situated in immediate proximity to an is <dig> insertion element, were moderately increased by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively . these findings demonstrated that in addition to the presence of an insertion element, two isolates could be differentiated on the basis of expression profiles.

previous reports indicated that is <dig> could serve as a mobile transcriptional enhancer in e. coli  <cit> . to determine whether the presence of is <dig> was responsible for the differences in transcription observed between isolates 'a' and 'b', an is <dig> gene deletion mutant was constructed using the lambda red recombinase gene replacement system  <cit> . we set up the following direct pairwise multiple replicated comparisons of transcriptional profiles: 'a' vs. 'b ', 'a' vs. 'aΔis5', 'aΔis5' vs. 'b'. in all these comparisons, genes involved in motility and chemotaxis represented the bulk of significant transcriptional differences . deleting a transposon element from an isolate 'a' reduced the activity of flagella regulon on average by a factor of two. in contrast, the flagella transcripts were still more abundant in Δis <dig> strain than in a 'b' isolate, approximately  <dig> fold on average, suggesting that the presence of an is <dig> element does not fully explain the difference in transcriptional activity of the motility regulon between two isolates.

a variety of molecular mechanisms are known to regulate the expression of motility and chemotaxis genes in e. coli  <cit> . to investigate other possible molecular causes that might be responsible for the differences in transcriptional activity between isolates 'a' and 'b', we compared sequences of known transcriptional regulators and some of their expected target promoters in two isolates. we have determined that the sequence of flhd, flhc, flia, flgm and lhra are identical between two isolates . detailed pcr analysis of every single motility and chemotaxis operon and intergenic sequences also revealed no discernable differences between two isolates .

discussion
herein we presented a reliable and efficient method for linear mapping of mobile elements using whole-genome dna microarrays. in summary, following dna microarray hybridization the algorithm to find dna sequences physically juxtaposed with the sequence of interest is:

 <dig>  calculate the median rank for each gene and sort them in ascending order;

 <dig>  estimate false discovery rates and use them to select a cut-off for significant genes;

 <dig>  filter significant genes by using information about their neighbours

we used sequence data and verification experiments to evaluate the performance of our method. the results were very encouraging. without any prior knowledge, we could identify positions of all known is <dig> elements, and could determine a previously unknown insertion site with high sensitivity and specificity.

another unique property of this approach is that we used single channel cdna microarray hybridization without a reference channel. although having reference channel could potentially control the variation of measurement for each spot, which reference sample should be used is sometimes very problematic  <cit> . using single channel array hybridization could circumvent the need for an often artificial and inadequate reference as well as it can substantially reduce the cost of microarray experiments. based on our results, single channel microarray experiments can be used to reliably predict the location of insertion sequences on the chromosome, but we need to pay an additional attention to the choice of normalization methods and test statistics. traditional global normalization and intensity based test statistics may not be applicable here. based on the presented results, using rank based statistics  can yield the best results. in the future, we will explore more the applicability of single channel microarray experiments as well as the related normalization and analytical issues in different biological contexts.

compared to the discriminant analysis by  <cit> , a big advantage of the proposed algorithm is that we do not have to have any a priori knowledge about the location of insertion elements. instead, our algorithm relies only on the microarray data to predict the locations of a sequence of interest. this property allowed us to identify a differentially localized is <dig> element in one bacterial isolate relative to another, where most of is <dig> elements had similar  locations. the assumption behind the discriminant analysis  <cit>  is that there exists a relatively fixed relationship between the distance from an insertion sequence and the fluorescent intensities of neighbouring probes. this assumption is stronger than ours. additional advantage of our algorithm is the ease of implementation. unlike our analysis, the discriminant analysis gives a score for each gene representing the probability that a gene corresponds to a true insertion site. however, we can use estimated fdr to decide the cut-off and use the filtering procedure to screen out possible false positive genes that greatly improves predictive power of the analysis.

dna microarrays have been successfully used to study relative abundances of rna and dna, and in this paper we presented a microarray application for mapping insertion elements in microbial genomes. here, we discuss how knowledge about the distribution of insertion elements in a bacterial genome leads to important biological insights. mapping and comparing the distribution of is <dig> elements in a laboratory strain e. coli mg <dig> led to the identification of two variants of this strain; these isolates were later found to be phenotypically distinct. moreover, data obtained from is mapping experiments allowed us to investigate and quantify the effect of is <dig> on the transcriptional activity of motility and chemotaxis genes in the genome of e. coli mg <dig> 

initial is <dig> mapping data predicted two main variants of e. coli strain mg <dig>  these isolates were obtained by analyzing randomly selected colonies from frozen stocks of the strain mg <dig> from the atcc. the only significant difference between these two strains was the presence of an is <dig> element upstream of the main flagella regulator, flhdc. further biological analyses confirmed the presence of this insertion and showed phenotypic differences between these isolates; one isolate 'a' with an is <dig> element upstream of the flhdc was more motile than isolate 'b', which did not contain such an insertion. interestingly, when a bacterial population from an original atcc stock was analyzed for the presence of an is <dig> in that location we found that about half of the colonies contained an is <dig> element in vicinity of the flhdc. in 100% of the examined cases the presence of the element correlated with higher motility of the cells. following up on this observation, we investigated the frequency of a spontaneous loss of a motile phenotype. five thousand colonies descended from a motile variant have been screened and no less motile revertants were found . this observation suggests that the heterogeneity observed in the e. coli population did not result from an unusually frequent transposition event. regardless of their origin, such heterogeneities when not accounted for may influence biological interpretation of experimental results where homogeneous offsprings are selected. for instance, before the discovery of the reported heterogeneity in a population of e. coli cells, we have observed on multiple occasions that knocking-out random genes results in differential expression of motility/flagella regulon. however, whenever we attempted to complement the knockouts we would discover that differential expression of motility genes was not affected by complementation. in fact, given the 50: <dig> heterogeneity of a population, there is a 25% chance of encountering motility related differences between a pure parent and a pure offspring and a 50% chance of encountering difference between a homogeneous offspring and an "impure" parent. we also observed instability of expression differences of the motility/chemotaxis regulon when compared biological replicates of liquid cultures grown from separate individual colonies. given some published reports of motility differences as a major result of gene disruption  <cit> , we would urge caution in interpreting such observations especially in the absence of convincing complementation data.

while this work was in progress, barker and co-workers reported the finding of motility variants in e. coli strain mg <dig>  <cit> . e. coli strains with increased motility contained is <dig> or is <dig> insertions in the promoter region of flhdc. the is <dig> element present in these strains was located  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in the upstream direction relative to reported flhdc transcription start site. moreover, the study reported increased expression of the flagella regulators flhd and flia as well as of some other genes that are known to be under the control of flhdc. these data suggested that is <dig> was responsible for increasing the level of expression of flagellar genes and producing cells with enhanced motility. our is mapping and motility assays results were in agreement with these findings. furthermore, the is <dig> identified in the strains with increased motility reported in our study were in a somewhat similar position  and in the same orientation as the is <dig> found in the strains reported by barker  <cit> . therefore, we decided to investigate whether the presence of is <dig> upstream of flhdc influenced the expression of motility and chemotaxis genes in e. coli. gene expression profiles were obtained for a motile isolate 'a' and its isogenic Δis <dig> derivative. the level of expression of flagellar genes in these strains was compared to the less motile isolate 'b'. our analysis showed that deletion of the is <dig> element situated upstream of the flhdc decreased the level of expression of flagellar genes but did not account for the differences in motility and gene expression observed between the motile and less motile isolates 'a' and 'b'. moreover, we observed that cells in which an is <dig> element had been deleted showed increased motility and up-regulation of flagellar genes when compared with less motile cells . these results are in agreement with the phenotypes observed in motility assays, strain 'aΔis5' had a swarming rate that was not very different from the swarming rate of the wild type strain a . these findings suggest that is <dig> can be one of the components of a complex mechanism involved in up-regulation of flagella genes and the increased motility phenotype. if an is <dig> were solely responsible for the heterogeneous motility observed in e. coli strains, then deletion of this transposon would have produced phenotypes similar, within error, to the ones observed in the less motile isolate 'b'. regulation of the flhdc is under control of a variety of mechanisms involving crp, h-ns, heat shock proteins and transcriptional regulators like lhra. it is possible that point mutations in any of these regulators or in flagellar regulators not yet identified could explain the observed phenotypic differences. the possibility that genome rearrangements such as deletions or amplifications are responsible for the differential motility phenotype has been ruled out based on comparative genome hybridization and fingerprinting.

the results presented in this report provide evidence that supports the role of is <dig> as a transcriptional enhancer of the flhdc-controlled operons. previously, is <dig> was linked to the activation and transcriptional regulation of the bgl operon in escherichia coli  <cit> . in this case, transcriptional activation was dependent on the presence of is <dig> and independent of its position and orientation relative to the promoter region. our data demonstrated that an is <dig> element  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site produces a mild enhancement of transcription of flagellar genes that translates into a slight increase in motility.

interestingly, transcriptional differences between isolates 'a' and 'b' are largely confined to the motility/chemotaxis regulon. if activity of global regulators that are known to modulate transcription of this regulon were perturbed, we would have expected a much wider scope of transcriptional differences between two isolates. if we assume that these narrow regulatory differences are centered on the activity of flhdc, then we could speculate that a modest 2-fold increase in the flhdc transcription results in more than 10-fold up-regulation of the flia. this level of transcriptional amplification translates into phenotypic differences of three to four folds in the swarming rates between the isolates.

the is mapping technique described in this study is a powerful tool that allows gaining insight into biological processes that might otherwise be overlooked when solely relied on available sequence data. this technique could be applied for de novo localization of mobile elements or of any other sequence determinant which position needs to be linearly mapped without any prior knowledge. in addition this type of genome-wide mapping combined with dna cross-linking might provide an efficient way to study three-dimensional chromosomal organization  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
microarray analysis combined with rank statistics is an efficient and reliable method to localized mobile elements in a bacterial genome. information obtained using this method allowed identification of two variants of escherichia coli strain mg <dig> in which the presence of an is <dig> element produced an enhancement in transcription of flagellar genes and a slight increase in motility. the technique described here can be applied to the linear mapping of any target sequence without prior knowledge of sequence information.
