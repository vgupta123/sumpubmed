BACKGROUND
soybean glycine max  merrill] is one of the most important leguminous crops in the world with a vital importance to the economies of many countries. brazil is responsible for 27% of the world soybean production and is second only to the u.s., which produces 35%
 <cit> . soybean seed products are used in a variety of industrial goods derived from oil  and protein  and are used to feed both humans and animals
 <cit> .

in the last decade, efforts have been undertaken to improve soybean crop yields. to this end, genetic engineering has been extensively used to develop soybean plants with abiotic and biotic resistance or tolerance
 <cit> . however, both the quantity of grain produced and the nutritional content of the grain are critical; therefore, the production of highly nutritional seeds of many important crops is currently a focus of research
 <cit> . furthermore, the soybean is also a viable platform for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical molecules, such as human growth hormone
 <cit>  and coagulation factor ix
 <cit> , for several reasons: the soybean can undergo long-term storage at ambient temperatures
 <cit> , can provide an appropriate biochemical environment for protein stability through the creation of specialized storage compartments
 <cit> , is not contaminated by human or animal pathogens
 <cit> , its desiccation characteristics prevent it from undergoing non-enzymatic hydrolysis or protease degradation
 <cit> , and it does not carry harmful substances that are present in certain plant leaves, which is important for downstream processing
 <cit> .

to enhance protein content analysis efforts, the use of technologies that permit the analysis of protein expression patterns has become a necessity in evaluating the genetic modification of these plants
 <cit> . the seed, leaf and root proteins of a variety of cultivars have been well documented
 <cit> . two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  is the most commonly used technique in proteomic analysis, and many types of proteomic studies based on 2de have been reported
 <cit> ; however, 2de is an extremely time-consuming technique. high throughput protein identification via 2de requires the use of replicate gels as well as gel excision and digestion procedures
 <cit> ; these steps can be complicated and slow. database comparisons are typically performed using peptide mass fingerprinting
 <cit> , and quantization is performed by gel image intensity evaluation or by protein tagging
 <cit> . all of these stages of 2de are time-consuming and can produce inconsistent results.

the coupling of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, as in nanouplc-mse procedures, provides more robust throughput sample analysis capabilities than other techniques. complex samples may be prepared in single vials, and all processes associated with chromatography, ms and ms/ms acquisition and database searching can be performed in a few steps
 <cit> . these experiments have led to significant innovations, such as the ability to obtain linear sequence structural information at the femtomole level
 <cit> , small surface areas and minimal dead volumes, which minimize analyte losses due to surface adsorption, as well as low flow rates, which minimize the required analyte dilution
 <cit> . low-abundance analytes can be separated with a high recovery rate when they are associated with a high dynamic range and a high-quality ms detection system
 <cit> . in this present study, we used mse, which is a data-independent acquisition method that uses low and high collision energies without precursor selection, unlike other methods such as data-dependent acquisition 
 <cit> . ion detection, clustering and the normalization of data-independent, alternate scanning lc-mse data have been explained in detail elsewhere
 <cit> .

here, we present a statistical assessment of soybean seeds using nanouplc-mse proteomic experiments and provide a comparison with the theoretical tryptic digestion of sequences from the uniprot
 <cit>  soybean database.

RESULTS
nanouplc-mse proteomics
the resulting soybean seed nanouplc-mse peptide data generated by the plgs process are shown in figure
1a. the experiment resulted in  <dig>  identified peptides; 58% of these peptides were obtained from peptide match type data in the first pass, and 6% were obtained in the second pass
 <cit> . a total of 17% of the peptides were identified by a missed trypsin cleavage, whereas an in-source fragmentation rate of 13% was expected for the synapt g <dig> data. figure
2a shows the peptide parts per million error  indicating that 82% of the peptides were detected with an error of less than  <dig> ppm. as shown in figure
2b, 75% of the identified proteins have at least  <dig> matched peptides, and 88% of the identified proteins have greater than 30% coverage . the experiment revealed  <dig> proteins, of which 87% were replicated  <dig> times, as shown in figure
1b and table
 <dig>  these results far exceed the minimum protein identification quality compared to other proteomic data, such as those obtained from the 2de technique, in which only  <dig> to 20% of the identified proteins exhibit a coverage greater than 30%
 <cit> .

the scoreavg is the average plgs score for each hit. productsavg is the average fragment ion products for a protein hit. peptideavg is the average of the peptide hits per identified protein. fmolcovariance is the covariance at the femtomole detection level for each protein in the replicate analyses. ngramavg is the average  of each protein load on the column. the repetition rate is the repeatability of each protein in the replicates. % of tsp is the percentage of each protein in the total soluble mixture relative to the total protein load  on the column.

figure
 <dig> shows the results obtained from dynamic range detection, indicating that  <dig> proteins were quantified. a 3-log range and a good detection distribution of high and low molecular weights were obtained, as indicated by the size of the squares. the  <dig> least abundant proteins includes b3tdk5_soybn-lipoxygenase, c7ea91_soybn-mutant glycinin subunit a1ab1b, q588z3_soybn-beta amylase, kti1_soybn-kunitz type trypsin inhibitor, lox1_soybn-seed lipoxygenase  <dig>  q4ler6_soybn-beta conglycinin alpha prime, c7ea92_soybn-mutant glycinin subunit a1ab1b, c6t7y4_soybn-putative uncharacterized protein, q5k3q9_soybn-putative dehydrin fragment and itrb_soybn-trypsin inhibitor b. the  <dig> most abundant proteins are composed of glyg1_soybn-glycinin g <dig>  q549z4_soybn-proglycinin a2b <dig>  q4ler5_soybn-beta conglycinin alpha subunit, q9aty1_soybn-kunitz trypsin inhibitor, q3v5s6_soybn-beta conglycinin alpha subunit, glyg2_soybn-glycinin g <dig>  c6sww4_soybn-putative uncharacterized protein, q39898_soybn-kunitz trypsin inhibitor, glyg5_soybn-glycinin and lec_soybn-lectin. a detailed description of each protein is presented in table
 <dig>  a comparison of our results with other proteomic data reveals that there is a discrepancy in the number of proteins that were identified. barbosa et al.
 <cit>  described  <dig> identified proteins, although these  <dig> 2de spots likely correspond to a lower number of proteins because many of the identifications are associated with the same protein with a pi shift. the same trend can be observed in the work presented by mooney et al.
 <cit> , which described  <dig> identifications of  <dig> spots detected via 2de. sakata et al.
 <cit>  described more than  <dig> spots in gels from cotyledons but reported only  <dig> identified proteins. our results mainly identify single proteins. however, there were some exceptions, especially for proteins that possess subunits with similar amino acid sequences, such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin, but are identified with a different accession number in the uniprot database.

we also compared the identified proteins and correlated them to their function. all identified proteins having at least two replicates are shown in table
 <dig>  a total of 42% of these data correspond to storage proteins, as shown in figure
1c. from tsp, 78% of the identified species correspond to glycinin and beta-conglycinin chains: glyg1_soybn-glycinin and q549z4_soybn-proglycinin a2b <dig> correspond to 18% and 12% of tsp, respectively
 <cit> ; 13% correspond to inhibitors, including q9aty1_soybn kunitz type  and q9sba9_soybn bowman birk proteinase inhibitor 
 <cit> ; 16% correspond to energy-related proteins, such as c0j370_soybn ribolose , q42795_soybn beta-amylases  and b3tdk4_soybn lipoxygenase ; and 17% are associated with abiotic stress, including q7xaw0_soybn dehydrin  and lea proteins 
 <cit> . an additional 13% correspond to putative uncharacterized proteins. late embryogenesis proteins and maturation proteins represent 7% of the proteins, including q39871_soybn , p93165_soybn em protein  and q9llq6_soybn seed maturation protein 
 <cit> . these results are in agreement with those of other studies
 <cit> .

uniprot data assessment
there are  <dig>  soybean sequence entries in the uniprot database. the theoretical tryptic digestion results show  <dig>  peptides. assuming one missed cleavage, the theoretical peptide database has  <dig>  entries,  <dig>  of which possess a molecular weight greater than  <dig> da. these results and a comparison with proteomic data are presented in figure
 <dig>  seed proteins represent  <dig> % of the protein database entries. at the peptide level, trypsin-digested seed proteins represent only  <dig> % of the theoretical peptide database, including missed cleavage proteins, which are responsible for only  <dig> % of the identified data. of the seed proteins detected in our experiments, 78% have a pi value between  <dig>  and  <dig>  this result is presented in figure
 <dig>  which shows that seed proteins have acidic characteristics. this characteristic was also reported by robic et al.
 <cit> . at the peptide level , 22% of all database peptides have a pi of less than  <dig>  and 25% of them have a pi between  <dig> and  <dig>  figure
 <dig> also shows that 43% of peptides resulting from the experiments have a pi value of less than  <dig>  this pattern is characteristic of tryptic digestion and lc-esi-ms experiments because the method favors charged peptides.

in table
 <dig>  we present the number of proteins that are not detected within a particular peptide molecular mass detection range. when assuming the minimum and maximum peptide detection levels found using nanouplc-mse experiments, i.e.,  <dig> to  <dig> da,  <dig> proteins do not have detectable peptides after trypsin digestion . the majority of these proteins correspond to putative and uncharacterized proteins, although nu6c_soybn nadh-quinone oxidoreductase is within the detection range and is not related to seed proteins. assuming  <dig> peptide at a threshold of  <dig>  da , a few seed proteins are not detected by nanouplc-mse: act6_soybn actin- <dig>  act7_soybn actin- <dig>  all50_soybn major gly  <dig> kda allergen and q7m212_soybn water-soluble 35k protein. with  <dig> peptides at an upper threshold of  <dig>  da , several putative proteins are not detected, including q3hm31_soybn hydrophobic seed protein and q692y3_soybn glycinin gy <dig> . with  <dig> peptides at an upper threshold of  <dig>  da , the not detected protein list is mainly composed of putative and uncharacterized proteins and other protein fragments that have short amino acid sequences.

many of these undetected proteins have been found in soybean seeds and described in other studies
 <cit> . an analysis of the undetected proteins in the database shows that the majority of the sequences are composed of short amino acid sequences with at most  <dig> residues. this observation may explain the level of missed detection in the nanouplc experiments. other proteins that are not described in this work, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , malate dehydrogenase , glutathione s-transferase , isoflavone reductase , alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  and in2- <dig> protein , have been described as soybean seed proteins. these proteins have been described in a previous study on the proteomics of transgenic soybean seeds expressing ctag recombinant proteins
 <cit> . further experiments must be performed to clarify this issue.

we hypothesize that environmental stress may have altered the seed expression profiles because the embrapa br- <dig> seeds were cultivated in the field, and the transgenic seeds were grown in a greenhouse. for example, barbosa et al.
 <cit>  and brandão et al.
 <cit>  reported different expression levels of enzymes in the transgenic soybean proteome of monsanto roundup-ready seeds. the authors state that the genetic modification itself could be a stress factor and may produce alterations in the seed proteome. a comparison between the results of this work and our previous study provides evidence in support of this hypothesis, indicating the need for further experiments to confirm possible proteome alterations due to genetic modification. nevertheless, highly hydrophobic or insoluble proteins will not be detected due to the necessity for in-solution protease digestion; special protocols are needed for the digestion of these types of protein.

CONCLUSIONS
nanouplc-mse experiments are a viable choice as a proteomic pipeline for soybean protein detection. nanouplc-mse provides good protein coverage with a  <dig> ppm peptide error, reduced sample manipulation relative to other techniques and detection of a wide range of peptide mws, i.e., from  <dig> to  <dig> da. because not all proteins from the uniprot database are covered, the use of a second digestion enzyme is recommended depending on the tissue to be analyzed. in the case of seed tissue, trypsin protein digestion results in good database coverage. the uniprot database has many duplicate entries that may result in false protein homolog association and must be formatted prior to use or the use of the reviewed sequences only. it also has many fragment entries that are not suitable for nanouplc-mse analysis but may be used in other techniques. the proteomic profile of embrapa br- <dig> seed lacks certain described proteins relative to transgenic soybean profiles reported in other studies. this discrepancy demonstrates the need for further transgenic and nontransgenic proteome analyses.
