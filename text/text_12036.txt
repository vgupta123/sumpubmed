BACKGROUND
cultivated peanut  is a major crop in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world and provides a significant source of oil and protein to large segments of the population in asia, africa and the americas. in the u. s., peanut is a high-value cash crop of regional importance, with major production areas concentrated in the southeast. plant breeding efforts to pyramid genes for disease and insect resistances, quality, and yield is hampered by the polyploid genetics of the crop species, the multigenic nature of many traits , and the difficulty of selecting for many traits in the field . thus, secondary selection methods that are environmentally neutral would greatly facilitate crop improvement efforts. molecular markers fit this criterion, but only recently have markers been developed that reveal sufficient polymorphisms in a. hypogaea and related species to have wide-spread application in peanut breeding. preliminary steps for utilizing molecular markers for crop improvement are developing collections of polymorphic markers and utilizing them to construct dense and high-resolution genetic maps.

constructing a high-quality genetic map depends largely upon finding one or more marker systems that can detect high levels of polymorphism between two individual parents. unfortunately, low levels of molecular polymorphism were observed within tetraploid  a. hypogaea throughout the 1990s and early 2000s with the marker systems available at that time  <cit> . however, compared with the limited numbers of polymorphic markers detected for the tetraploid, the same marker systems can uncover high levels of molecular polymorphism within and between the diploid  peanut species. this polymorphism led researchers to create molecular maps for arachis. the first molecular map in peanut was constructed between the diploids a. stenosperma krapov. and w.c. gregoryx and a. cardenasii krapov. and w.c. gregory by halward et al.  <cit>  who used restriction fragment length polymorphisms  to associate  <dig> markers into  <dig> linkage groups. additional maps were subsequently published using randomly amplified polymorphic dna   <cit>  and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . burow et al.  <cit>  published the first tetraploid map in peanut based on  <dig> rflp loci across  <dig> linkage groups by utilizing the complex interspecific cross, florunner × 4x a. batizocoi krapov. and w.c. gregory ]. another interspecific tetraploid linkage map of  <dig> loci and  <dig> linkage groups was derived from a backcross population between a. hypogaea and a synthetic amphidiploid  <cit> . only recently have linkage maps been developed from crosses between a. hypogaea genotypes, most with less than  <dig> loci and with more than the expected  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> . an exception is the recently published map containing  <dig> loci across  <dig> linkage groups that was constructed in part with highly polymorphic markers derived from sequences harboring miniature inverted repeat transposable elements  <cit> . therefore, there is a continuing need to generate dense linkage maps for the cultivated tetraploid peanut that will not only cluster the markers into the expected  <dig> linkage groups to cover the haplotype chromosomes, but also to facilitate marker-trait association and eventually assist in its genetic improvement.

the domesticated peanut is thought to have arisen from a single hybridization event between two diploid wild species followed by whole genome duplication approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . this short evolutionary history, along with hybridization barriers between diploids and the tetraploid have resulted in a narrow genetic base for the cultivated tetraploid peanut. on the contrary, diploid arachis species are genetically diverse, have simpler inheritance patterns, and most importantly, contain a rich source of agronomically important traits for peanut improvement. due to these attributes, diploid arachis species have been proposed as model systems to map the peanut genome. because the genomes of progenitor diploid species  are closely allied to the cultivated peanut  <cit> , mapping the genome of one or both of these species should be useful for predicting the positions of loci in the cultivated peanut. this approach has been employed in wheat  <cit> , alfalfa  <cit> , oat  <cit> , and other crop species.

one accession of a. ipaensis and  <dig> accessions of a. duranensis have been collected in south america. the largest concentration of a. duranensis is in southern bolivia and northern argentina, with a few populations being reported in paraguay and one in central brazil  <cit> . the species is morphologically diverse and the bolivia and argentina types can be separated cytogenetically and morphologically  <cit> . due to the availability of diverse accessions to produce intraspecific crosses in the greenhouse, a dense linkage map in the diploid species a. duranensis was produced using large numbers of molecular markers derived from transcribed sequences.

RESULTS
species relationships
a preliminary study of ssr marker variation among  <dig> a. duranensis accessions using  <dig> markers indicated that the species is highly polymorphic at the molecular level and individual accessions could be separated based on a cluster analysis . interestingly, we found that a. ipaensis, the proposed b-genome  progenitor species, clustered with the a-genome  species a. stenosperma and not with the b-genome species a. batizocoi. recent molecular cytogenetic analysis of a- and non-a-  genome species suggests that karyotype diversity among non-a-genome species is extensive enough to support separation into additional genome classes where a. ipaensis remains in b sensu stricto while a. batizocoi is placed into a separate group  <cit> . therefore, a. batizocoi is less typical of b-genome species.


the number of polymorphic ssr markers between paired a. duranensis accessions ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> out of  <dig>  which is  <dig> to 67% of the total number of ssr markers screened. this is a significant amount of variation, which indicates the high genetic diversity within the species. based on cluster analysis, success of crosses, and fertility of f1s, accessions pi  <dig> and grif  <dig> were selected for subsequent mapping studies using  <dig> f <dig> progenies. screening of the parental accessions with  <dig>  ssr markers derived from a. hypogaea est sequences resulted in  <dig>   that were scorable  and  <dig>  that were polymorphic . the same markers were used to create a map between two a. batizocoi accessions and to determine syntenic relationships between the a and b genome species .

arachis duranensis genetic map
the total number of published ssr markers has now risen beyond the  <dig>  cataloged in a related paper by guo et al.  to around  <dig>   <cit> . those most recently reported include:  <dig> by gimenes et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by mace et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by proite et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by cuc et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by yuan et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by song et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by wang et al.  <cit> ;  <dig> by liang et al.  <cit> ; and  <dig>  by koilkonda et al.  <cit> . five hundred and ninety-eight of these markers are included in the a. duranensis map . of the  <dig> genomic ssr markers mapped in the current study ,  <dig> were mapped previously in an interspecific population between a. duranensis and a. stenosperma <cit> . these markers served to anchor and align the current and previously published peanut maps . linkage group assignments of all markers were consistent between the current map and that of bertioli et al.  <cit>  except for the marker gm <dig>  that was localized on chromosome 2a  in their interspecific map, while mapping to chromosome 10a in the a. duranensis intraspecific map. although detailed information for parental alleles in the study by bertioli et al.  <cit>  was not presented, gm <dig> amplified only one locus from each parent in both their population and ours. it is, therefore, unlikely that the marker location discrepancy was due to mapping of multiple loci and perhaps could reflect a small chromosomal rearrangement. chromosomal rearrangements are not unexpected based on previous cytological observations in the genus  <cit> .


markers were renamed in order to follow a unified marker nomenclature. the complete list of renamed markers can be found in guo et al. .

est libraries of a. duranensis were developed to produce single nucleotide polymorphism  markers for mapping . of the  <dig>  snp markers developed ,  <dig>  were included in the a. duranensis map . the remaining  <dig> snp markers were either of low quality  or they showed segregation patterns  that could not be mapped. of the  <dig>  mapped snp markers,  <dig> were derived from the cdna sequencing project while the other  <dig> were genomic legume orthologs.

the a. duranensis map produced in this study contained  <dig>  markers combined into  <dig> linkage groups with a total genetic distance of  <dig>  cm. mstmap, a software program that accommodates large numbers of markers and utilizes a “minimum spanning tree” algorithm, was used to construct an initial genetic map using only the codominant markers. the  <dig>  codominant markers were distributed into  <dig> co-segregating groups . although this program has been reported to be accurate for large-scale mapping projects  <cit> , few independent studies are available establishing consistency between mstmap and other commonly used mapping software  <cit> . to confirm the linkage group assignments, marker orders, and genetic distances determined by alternative software, both codominant and dominant markers were mapped with joinmap  <dig> . marker orders and genetic distances were highly consistent between mstmap and joinmap  <dig>  .

significant segregation distortion  was observed for  <dig>  markers . chromosomes 4a and 9a carried particularly long segments of distorted segregation suggesting large-scale chromosomal selection in these regions. guo et al.  found that a single linkage group  in a. batizocoi was syntenic with chromosomes 4a and 9a of a. duranensis implicating inversion and reciprocal translocation events as the underlying chromosomal rearrangements in this b-genome species. recombination frequencies were generally low in the central, presumably centromeric chromosomal regions of a. duranensis and increased toward the telomeres, a pattern typical of many plant species  <cit> . more even distribution was observed along chromosome 3a and only slightly suppressed recombination was observed around the presumable location of the centromere .

across the a. duranensis linkage map, each linkage group spanned on average  <dig>  cm  and included  <dig>  markers  . this is considerably denser than the previously published aa, bb, and aabb maps consisting of only a few hundred markers. for example, the a. ipaensis × a. magna b-genome map published by moretzsohn et al.  <cit>  had  <dig> ssr markers grouped into  <dig> linkages, whereas the b-genome ssr-based map in our related paper consists of  <dig> loci in  <dig> linkage groups . the a-genome map produced using the interspecific hybrid a. duranensis × a. stenosperma had  <dig> ssrs that were mapped into  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> . for a. hypogaea, there are now several maps with the most dense consensus map containing  <dig> loci on  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> .


the map produced in the current study is the first high-density map available in peanut, and because it was generated from a progenitor species of a. hypogaea, we anticipate that it will have significant applications for analyzing the cultivated genome. for example, the data generated in this map was used by nagy et al.  <cit>  to more precisely map the rma gene for nematode resistance that originated from an introgression line between a. hypogaea and a. cardenasii. the a-genome snp array also has been useful at the tetraploid level for genotyping a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between cultivated peanut and a synthetic a. ipaensis x a. duranensis tetraploid .

gene annotation and comparative mapping
homology search of the  <dig>  mapped loci resulted in significant hits for  <dig>  loci in at least one of the three databases: medicago, uniprot and genbank nr database, and  <dig> of the mapped loci gave significant similarities in either of the two gene ontology databases: medicago gene atlas and tair . altogether  <dig>  gene ontology terms were assigned to the  <dig> genes. these were distributed among the three major gene ontology categories as follows:  <dig> molecular functions,  <dig> biological processes, and  <dig> cellular components .

the sequences used to create the a. duranensis map also were compared to the genomes of two legumes where  <dig> loci on the a. duranensis map could be mapped to m. truncatula, and  <dig>  matches could be found in g. max . while a majority of the dots in the synteny plots appear to be random , there are definite clusters of markers, and striking examples of colinearity , especially for the comparisons to glycine. presumably there has been extensive single gene movement since the last common ancestors in one or both species, but many genes remain in the ancestral locations and can be detected. overall, the synteny patterns for g. max showed the recent whole genome duplication within glycine, with each location in peanut showing corresponding synteny at two locations in glycine. colinearity between medicago and arachis is much less conserved than between arachis and glycine. this could be due to extensive inversions in either genome, or more likely, due to preliminary ordering of sequences within the medicago unfinished genome assembly. in general, the patterns showed strong synteny on the chromosomal ends in both genetic and physical distance, while the central regions of chromosomes tended to show less synteny. presumably this could be attributed to pericentromeric heterochromatin which is known to define less recombinogenic regions where genomic rearrangements are more likely to persist  <cit> . chromosome arms tend to be maintained as syntenic between glycine and arachis, but there is evidence that chromosome arms have been translocated in some cases so that synteny exists at the chromosome arm level, but less so at the whole chromosome level.


CONCLUSIONS
this investigation provided a large number of de novo est sequences that were deposited into genbank. the markers developed here are valuable resources for peanut and, more broadly to the legume research community. this research presents the first high-density molecular map in peanut with  <dig>  markers grouped into the  <dig> expected linkage groups for an a-genome species. because the map was produced with the progenitor species a. duranensis which contributed the a genome of a. hypogaea, it will serve as the reference map for both wild and cultivated species. lastly, synteny was found between arachis and the glycine and medicago genomes, which indicates that markers developed for other legume species may be of value for crop improvement in peanut. the a-genome map will have utility for fine mapping in other peanut species and has already had application to mapping a nematode resistance gene that was introgressed to a. hypogaea from a. cardenasii.
