BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni is a causative agent of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in humans, and is responsible for an estimated  <dig> million cases annually worldwide  <cit> . although this bacterium poses a significant economic burden, little is known or understood about the mechanisms of pathogenicity. some factors, however, have been ascertained to contribute toward the overall pathogenicity of the infecting strain such as chemotaxis, adherence to host cells and surface glycans including lipooligosaccharide  <cit> .

chemotaxis and motility have been implicated in the colonisation and virulence of many pathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, as well as c. jejuni <cit> . homologues of the chemotactic pathway have been identified in c. jejuni nctc  <dig> and include ten putative chemotactic sensory receptors, tlps, and two aerotaxis receptors  <cit> . the receptors are grouped according to their putative function as assigned by homology to known chemoreceptors of other organisms  <cit> . the group a consist of tlp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all of which contain distinct domains comprising of two transmembrane domains, a sensory domain and a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain  <cit> . due to similarity to methyl-accepting chemotactic proteins from other bacterial species, group a tlp receptors are thought likely to sense ligands external to the cell  <cit> . only two of the group a tlp proteins of c. jejuni have been characterised to date, the aspartate receptor, tlp <dig>  <cit>  and tlp <dig> which binds to formic acid  <cit> .

recent analysis of full and partial sequenced strains of c. jejuni has shown diversity in the group a tlp receptor set and indicated that tlp <dig> was the only receptor universally represented in all sequenced strains of c. jejuni <cit> . this high conservation can be explained by the fact that tlp <dig> encodes the aspartate receptor for c. jejuni <cit> , aspartate being one of the carbon sources used in c. jejuni metabolism. the receptor set for  <dig> was previously reported to be similar to that of  <dig> genome sequenced strain, including that of tlp <dig>  which is represented as a “pseudogene”, however, tlp <dig> is presumed to be a functional protein in strain hb93- <dig>  as there is no stop codon to interrupt the sequence  <cit> . a recent study has shown that each portion of tlp <dig> can be translated as separate proteins and still function in chemotaxis of this organism  <cit> .

it has previously been suggested that receptor subset variation may be dependent on strain source or relative pathogenicity, since variance in the chemoreceptor subset has been shown for some uropathogenic strains of e. coli, which all lack the functional receptors trg  and tap  usually present within strains isolated from faecal material  <cit> . in c. jejunitlp <dig> is the only receptor where this has been tested using strains from different sources. zautner et al.  showed that dtlp7tlp <dig> encoded by two separate genes rather than a single transcript, was over-represented in bovine strains and underrepresented in human isolates  <cit> .

in addition to  <dig> group a tlp genes encoded by c. jejuni  <dig>  a unique tlp, designated as tlp <dig>  was identified in some c. jejuni strains and was shown to share sequence similarity with tcpi, a chemoreceptor involved in stimulating the expression of the ct and tcp pathway of vibrio cholerae <cit> . it has yet to be established if tlp <dig> exists in other c. jejuni isolates and whether it has a role in enhancing virulence or if it has an effect on the expression levels of the other group a tlp genes.

although genome analysis has demonstrated which receptor sets are present in partially and fully-sequenced strains of c. jejuni, whether gene expression is conserved has yet to be elucidated. here we report the variation in c. jejuni chemoreceptor gene subsets within the genomes of 33 c. jejuni strains, including nctc  <dig> -gs and –o, isolated from both avian and human hosts. c. jejuni 11168-gs is the non-colonising, non-invasive variant of nctc  <dig> with known decreases in virulence-associated phenotypes and with a number of point mutations when compared to the original isolate  from which it was derived  <cit> . we also report receptor gene expression modulation in vivo, during colonisation of avian and mammalian hosts, and in vitro under varying growth conditions.

RESULTS
tlp gene content of different c. jejuni strains
thirty-three strains of c. jejuni isolated from chicken and human hosts were analysed to elucidate which tlp genes were present in the genomes of these strains and if any relatedness to the isolation host could be ascertained. the identity of each group a tlp receptor for all seven known group a tlp genes, tlp1- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in each of the 33 c. jejuni strains were determined by pcr amplification . the c. jejuni strains tested appeared to possess varied sets of group a tlp receptor genes, with six strains  possessing all seven group a tlp genes . tlp <dig> was present in all strains tested and is the only universally conserved tlp gene within the strains . tlp <dig> was present in  <dig> of  <dig> strains, while, tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> were detected in  <dig> of  <dig> strains making them the next most conserved of the tlp genes . the least representatively conserved tlp genes, other than tlp <dig>  were tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> .

sequencing results of tlp7
tlp <dig> is annoted as a “pseudogene” in c. jejuni  <dig> though a recent study showed it is functional in strains that do not possess an uninterrupted tlp <dig> reading frame  <cit> . another study also showed that the presence of the interrupted reading frame is over or underrepresented in strains isolated from different sources  <cit> . due to this we sequenced each tlp <dig> amplicon to determine if the gene was present as a full length reading frame or if it was split into two open reading frames with the introduction of a stop codon. the pcr primers used to amplify tlp <dig> were designed to amplify across the split between cj0951c/cj0952c of c. jejuni  <dig>  sequencing data showed in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains that contain tlp <dig> that it is present as an uninterrupted gene sequence . in the remaining eight strains it exists as two separate open reading frames indicating that tlp <dig> is produced as two separate proteins in these strains .

relative expression of tlp genes by qpcr
in order to determine relative gene expression profiles of the c. jejuni group a tlp genes at varying conditions in vitro and in vivo, c. jejuni strains, 11168-gs, 11168-o and  <dig> were grown in vitro, at 37°c, 42°c and maintained in pond water at 20–25°c, and in vivo by colonising avian and mammalian hosts and then isolated directly from animals by immunomagnetic separation  . growth at 37°c, 42°c was assessed as it mimics mammalian and avian hosts in vitro and allows a direct comparison with expression of tlps in cells directly isolated from animal hosts. maintenance in pond water  at 20–25°c is used to mimic environmental conditions  <cit> , as surface and reservoir water contamination is a potential environmental source for c. jejuni outbreaks  <cit> . relative gene expression of the group a tlp receptors in c. jejuni under all these different conditions was then assessed by quantitative pcr. the expression of tlp genes was compared between each strain and growth condition. only statistically significant differences  are described below.

comparison of the group a tlp gene expression for c. jejuni 11168-o, 11168-gs and 81116
the expression levels of tlp genes within c. jejuni strain 11168-o were generally varied, with tlp <dig> and  <dig> showing higher expression levels compared to the other tlp genes. it is interesting to note that tlp <dig> showed the lowest level of expression , particularly in cells isolated from the intestines of chicks and from bacteria grown in laboratory conditions at 42°c. contrary to all expectations, the expression of tlp <dig> was very high under all conditions tested, irrespective of the fact that it is a present as two separate gene transcripts in c. jejuni 11168-o . this high level of expression correlated with the finding that tlp <dig> may act as a functional receptor even when present as two separate genes  <cit> .

in contrast, the expression profiles for the group a tlp genes in c. jejuni 11168-gs all displayed similar patterns of gene expression. the expression of tlp genes in 11168-gs appeared to be temperature dependent with the lowest level of expression observed in bacteria maintained at room temperature in pond water . the highest levels of expression were observed in bacteria grown at 37°c, while in most cases expression at 42°c were lower than those seen at 37°c. unlike c. jejuni 11168-o, 11168-gs tlp gene expression appears to be related to temperature, however not all tlp genes were expressed at the same level.

gene expression profiles for the group a tlp genes in c. jejuni  <dig> in vitro and in vivo were also diverse. it is notable that the expression of the aspartate receptor gene, tlp <dig>  was the lowest of all tlp genes, with almost no detectable expression when grown at 37°c, 42°c or in pond water. in contrast, tlp <dig> was highly expressed in c. jejuni  <dig> isolated from in vivo hosts  . expression levels seen for tlp <dig>  tlp <dig>  tlp <dig>  tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> were all higher in c. jejuni isolated from both in vivo hosts, compared to bacteria grown at an equivalent temperature under laboratory conditions, indicating that host factors are involved in stimulation of tlp gene expression. the expression of tlp <dig> and  <dig> were consistently higher than the other tlp genes under all conditions tested, with the highest expression observed for tlp <dig> in  <dig> isolated from the intestines of mice.

verification of tlp <dig> expression by western blot
to verify that mrna levels detected by qpcr reflected the level of protein produced in the bacterial cells, western blot analysis was performed, using whole cell protein of c. jejuni 11168-o, 11168-gs and  <dig> grown or maintained in the laboratory at room temperature, at 37°c and 42°c, with polyclonal antisera raised against purified periplasmic domain of tlp <dig> protein . quantitative analysis of the cellular tlp <dig> protein, detected by the specific antisera, showed that cellular protein levels changed according to the growth conditions. tlp <dig> was present in 11168-o grown at 37°c at  <dig>  fold greater than in pond water maintained bacteria, and  <dig> -fold greater than in bacteria grown at 42°c . these results are in agreement with qpcr analysis which showed that tlp <dig> was expressed highest in c. jejuni grown at 37°c,  <dig> -fold more than c. jejuni maintained in pond water at room temperature and 275-fold higher than c. jejuni grown at 42°c. the protein levels of tlp <dig> were seen to be more than four-fold higher in c. jejuni 11168-gs then in any of the conditions tested for c. jejuni 11168-o or  <dig> which correlates well with the apparent over-expression seen in 11168-gs for tlp <dig>  c. jejuni  <dig> showed the lowest protein levels also in agreement with the expression data.

discussion
this report describes the analysis of the group a chemosensory receptor content of various c. jejuni strains and the modulation of expression of the tlp genes under varying in vitro and in vivo conditions. analysis of the chemoreceptor subsets demonstrated that the most conserved tlp genes were tlp <dig> and tlp <dig>  with the presence of these genes verified in all bacterial strains tested. previous analysis of the ten sequenced strains  revealed that in all strains, tlp <dig> amino acid sequences were  <dig> - 100% identical  <cit> . it appears likely that this level of conservation is due to tlp <dig> being the sensory receptor for aspartate in c. jejuni <cit> , where aspartate is one of the few carbon sources utilised in c. jejuni metabolism  <cit> . it is interesting to note that although tlp <dig> was ubiquitously present within c. jejuni strains tested, it had the lowest levels of expression in all strains tested at different temperatures in vitro and in bacteria isolated directly from animal hosts. this observation contrasts with reports for other bacterial aspartate receptors, including tar of e. coli, which is 5– <dig> fold more abundant than other chemoreceptors in that organism  <cit> . it would be interesting to determine if tlp <dig> is indeed a minor receptor among others or whether there are controlling elements involved in translation and protein stability that may influence the numbers of individual receptors in receptor clusters which are yet to be demonstrated for c. jejuni. we can note, however, that expression of the tlp <dig> gene appears to be tightly controlled for successful colonisation of chickens  <cit> . in hartley-tassell et al. , we showed that an isogenic mutant of tlp <dig> failed to properly colonise the chick model indicating that expression of tlp <dig> is involved in establishing normal colonisation. we also showed that over-expression of tlp <dig> was detrimental to normal colonisation as the complemented isogenic mutant of tlp <dig> had comparatively higher expression levels than that seen in wild-type c. jejuni 11168-o and thus was only able to poorly complement the mutant  <cit> .

similar to the aspartate sensory receptor, tlp <dig> was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains tested in this study. tlp <dig> was previously reported as being a “pseudogene” in c. jejuni  <dig>  <cit>  and in all but one of the sequenced strains , c. jejuni hb93- <dig>  <cit> . however, with the full annotated sequence of c. jejuni  <dig> and an updated annotation of c. jejuni 81– <dig> being released, tlp <dig> has been reassigned as a functional gene in these strains, which agrees with our sequence analysis. interestingly, tlp <dig> shows amino acid identity of >93% among the strains we tested, irrespective whether the gene was an uninterrupted open reading frame or if it was present as two open reading frames separated by a stop codon. in addition, tlp <dig> was highly expressed, often being the most abundantly expressed of all group a tlp genes in strains  <dig> and nctc  <dig>  which were tested using different growth conditions, including expression in vivo in murine and avian hosts. it has been shown that the two proteins of tlp <dig>  cj0951c and cj0952c, are expressed separately but can still function as a formic acid receptor  <cit> . this indicates that the periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains of tlp <dig> encoded by cj0951c/cj0952c are likely to be able to integrate into sensory receptor clusters and interact in order to transduce the signal to the cheay/chew/chev complex  <cit> .

the second most commonly occurring chemoreceptors were tlp <dig> and tlp <dig>  tlp <dig> was absent in 81– <dig>   <dig> and gch <dig> but showed highly variable expression depending on the strain of bacteria and the growth/maintenance condition tested. expression of tlp <dig> was high in all strains at most of the conditions tested. although no ligand has been identified for tlp <dig> in c. jejuni, the high overall expression of tlp <dig> indicates that the ligand may be of some importance for the survival or colonisation of this organism. expression of this receptor gene within an animal host, in particular the murine model, was higher than under laboratory conditions, with 100– <dig> fold greater expression in mice than in chickens indicating a possible role of tlp <dig> in opportunistic infection of mammalian hosts.

the presence of tlp <dig> and  <dig> within the genomes of c. jejuni were the most variable with  <dig> strains lacking one or both of these genes. this result is comparable to the analysis of the sequenced strains of c. jejuni  with four of the  <dig> strains lacking one or both of tlp <dig> or  <dig>  like tlp <dig>  the amino acid sequences of tlp <dig> and  <dig> are less conserved than tlp <dig> and  <dig>  the expression levels of tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> were variable between strains and conditions tested with tlp <dig> being one of the most abundantly expressed tlps in c. jejuni 11168-o isolated from mice. little is known about either tlp <dig> or tlp <dig> with respect to ligand binding specificity; however it is interesting to note that these two tlps along with tlp <dig> share almost 100% homology within the cytoplasmic signalling domain of the proteins  <cit> .

interestingly one of the recently acquired hospital isolates, gch <dig>  lacked all three of these tlps . this strain only possessed tlp <dig>  7w,  <dig> and  <dig> and was able to produce disease of sufficient severity to require hospitalisation. while no data is available on the age or immune competency of the patient, it is clear that a strain with this subset of receptors is able to efficiently infect a human host and cause disease. in 11168-o and  <dig>  tlp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were all induced when in an animal host as compared to laboratory growth conditions. the regulation of tlp <dig> under host conditions is currently unknown.

tlp <dig> was the least common of the group a tlps, only present in the genome of ten of the  <dig> strains tested and only found in one of the  <dig> sequenced strains of c. jejuni, 84– <dig>  the expression of tlp <dig> did not vary with the conditions tested. as yet the ligand for tlp <dig> is unknown but interestingly c. jejuni 84– <dig> is an isolate from a rare campylobacter meningitis case  <cit> , while  <dig> is a highly invasive strain of c. jejuni <cit>  and each of the gold coast hospital isolates were of sufficient disease severity that the infected individuals required hospitalisation. thus suggesting that tlp <dig> may in fact be a marker of virulence in c. jejuni.

it is important to note that c. jejuni 11168-gs and 11168-o express group a tlp genes differently under the same conditions, with 11168-gs generally expressing the tlps at a higher and more uniform level than 11168-o. a representative example of this difference was the expression of tlp <dig> at growth temperatures of 37°c and 42°c with c. jejuni 11168-gs expressing tlp <dig> up to  <dig>  fold greater than 11168-o. the protein level of tlp <dig> in c. jejuni 11168-gs was also shown to be significantly higher than that seen for 11168-o. gaynor et al.  noted changes in sigma factor sequences indicating that there may be changes in the way genes are regulated in the two strains  <cit> . while their analysis did not discover any expression changes in tlps there was expression changes in genes involved in chemotaxis, such as chew and flagella. in addition, there were differences noted in amino acid uptake and catabolism genes including some involved in the processing of aspartate  <cit> . the comparison of data presented here and that already shown by gaynor et al.  indicates that there is likely to be a broad disregulation of chemotaxis and the processing of the molecules that are known to be ligands for c. jejuni chemotaxis in 11168-gs. this disregulation may be directly related to the protein sequence changes noted in the three sigma factors screened  <cit> . as we have previously mentioned, tight control of tlp <dig> expression appears to be important for optimum colonisation of chickens  <cit> . it is therefore possible to speculate that the altered expression of tlps in 11168-gs may contribute to reduced ability of this variant to colonise animals and to invade mammalian cells in cell culture  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study has demonstrated that chemoreceptor subsets vary between c. jejuni strains with the aspartate receptor, tlp <dig>  conserved in all subsets observed. expression of chemosensory group a tlp genes was similar between strains with tlp <dig> and tlp <dig> typically the highest expressed tlps and with expression generally higher in animal hosts than under laboratory conditions.
