BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  is the causative agent of johne's disease. the complete genome sequence of m. ap k- <dig> was published in  <dig>  <cit>  revealing a single circular chromosome of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  predicted open reading frames . roughly,  <dig> % of the genomic dna is repetitive sequences, many of which are is elements including  <dig> copies of is <dig> and seven copies of is <dig>  <cit> . previously, comparative genomic hybridizations were utilized to examine the extent of genomic diversity among members of the m. avium complex including m. avium subsp. avium , m. avium subsp. hominissuis  and m. ap using dna microarrays  <cit> . in these studies, areas of genomic rearrangements  were found between m. ap and m. av, a reflection of the plasticity of mycobacterial genomes. however, no appreciable differences were found when the genomes of the sequenced strain, m. ap k- <dig>  and the type strain, m. ap atcc  <dig>  were compared. using dna microarrays, gene order information  related to each of the genomes was not obtained because of the nature of dna microarray analysis. here, we applied optical mapping to examine the difference between those two strains, on a genome-wide scale.

optical mapping is unique among methods for analyzing genomes in that large-scale organizational information about the genome is preserved by physical attachment of large dna fragments to a surface and assembly of a restriction digestion map based on imaging of a large number of individual restriction-digested genomic dna molecules bound to the surface  <cit> . such physical maps have uncovered unique genomic elements and provided scaffolds for genome sequencing and validation efforts that include: deinococcus radiodurans  <cit> , rhodospirillum rubrum  <cit> , yersinia pestis  <cit> , plasmodium falciparum  <cit>  and two xenorhabdus species  <cit> , as well as comparative genomics of shigella flexneri, yersinia pestis, and escherichia coli  <cit> . comparative genomic analyses using optical mapping data readily discover and characterize gene duplications, indels and genomic rearrangements. in unique ways, the system accurately identifies genomic copy-neutral variations such as inversions and translocations, which compensates for analysis shortcomings of other genomic approaches such as comparative genomic hybridizations, restriction fragment length polymorphism and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  <cit> .

the main goal of this study was to examine variations between two closely related genomes by optical mapping, which had never been applied to mycobacteria. the complete genome sequence for one of the examined strains  is already available  <cit>  while the genome of m. ap atcc  <dig>  the type strain of the species, has not been sequenced. an optical map with a resolution of ~ <dig> bp did not reveal significant indels between the genomes. however, the map indicated that a 648-kb region was inverted relative to the published genome sequence of m. ap k- <dig>  sequencing analysis revealed that the inverted region is flanked by repetitive sequences. additionally we find that the map0008c gene is 45-bp longer and there are two additional orfs nearly identical to is <dig> and is_map <dig> that differ from the published sequence.

RESULTS
the optical map of m. ap atcc 19698
to generate an optical map of m. ap atcc  <dig>  genomic dna of the strain was digested with bsiwi, and information of length and physical arrangement of the digested fragments were visualized and collected under a fluorescent microscope. to start the de novo assembly process of the m. ap atcc  <dig> optical map, we selected the largest ~5% of the optical contigs  with average restriction fragment sizes less than  <dig> kb, and assembled these contigs to form a whole-genome map, termed an "optical consensus map". the predicted average size of in silico m. ap k- <dig> bsiwi fragments was  <dig>  kb, which guided our choice for average fragment size of less than  <dig> kb for m. ap atcc  <dig> genome assembly. a total of  <dig> high molecular weight gdna  contigs were acquired allowing for the construction of a genome-wide consensus map of m. ap atcc  <dig> with a summed mass of  <dig>  mb, or approximately 82-fold coverage of the m. ap k- <dig> genome . the bsiwi final consensus map comprises  <dig> restriction fragments, which was  <dig> fragments less than those of the in silico map of m. ap k- <dig>  mostly because fragments smaller than  <dig> bp or two adjacent fragments that are both smaller than  <dig> kb cannot be efficiently detected by optical mapping.

additionally, three optical fragments  were not aligned to the k- <dig> in silico map, most likely due to absence of bsiwi sites on the atcc  <dig> dna or because artificial bsiwi sites on k- <dig> that were introduced by sequence errors. based on the size of flanking regions, those fragments are not likely to be novel insertion sequences. the size of m. ap atcc  <dig> optical map was scaled according to its known g+c content for correcting raw fluorescence intensities measurements altered by very high g+c content  <cit> . corrected estimates of the physical map revealed that the atcc  <dig> genome size is  <dig>  kb,  <dig> kb > the sequence of m. ap k- <dig>   <cit> . this 9-kb difference includes additional sequences  that will be described later in this article. the rest  <dig>  kb represents  <dig> % of the sequenced genome and within the expected error level when sizing fragments with fluorescent intensity.

alignment of the m. ap atcc  <dig> and k- <dig> restriction maps
to examine regions of difference between the m. ap strains, the assembled optical consensus map of m. ap atcc  <dig> was aligned to an in silico restriction map of m. ap k- <dig> with the bsiwi restriction enzyme. alignment of the genomes revealed a high degree of similarity between the genomes, given the ~600-bp resolution power  <cit>  used in this study. however, the alignment revealed a ~648-kb segment  consisting of  <dig> m. ap k- <dig> bsiwi fragments that were inverted compared to the m. ap atcc  <dig> optical consensus map. a circular map aligning the annotated m. ap k- <dig> and m. ap atcc  <dig> genomes was constructed to illustrate the location of the inverted region , which interestingly, spans the origin of replication.

southern blotting analysis of the inverted region
to confirm possible breakpoints of the identified inversion fragment, we applied southern blotting analysis to compare the fragment sizes from both genomes digested with bsiwi and detected with ~850-bp probes . the probes were designed either from an aligned fragment in the optical map , or from a non-aligned fragment  to validate the alignment pattern. in parallel, we also hybridized kpni-digested genomic dna with the same sets of probes. interestingly, the hybridization patterns showed no difference between the two genomes in the two examined fragments , in contrast to the result suggested by alignment of the published genome sequence to the optical map.

pcr and sequencing analyses
pcr primers were designed to amplify regions that contain possible inversion breakpoints. on the basis of the alignment between the two genomes, different patterns of amplification were expected from the genomes of m. ap k- <dig> and m. ap atcc  <dig>  the average size of bsiwi restriction fragments that were included in the map assembly was  <dig>  kb, larger than the size of a regular pcr amplification. therefore, we divided target dna fragments into ~3-kb segments with several primer pairs to ensure efficient pcr amplification. when using a primer pair that would amplify a fragment containing an inversion breakpoint, an amplicon was expected from one genome but not from the other genome. we attempted to amplify a total of  <dig> fragments spanning the entire inverted region . consistent with the southern blotting results, we found that with all pairs of primers, the same sizes of products were obtained from both genomes . an example of the pcr analysis is presented in figure  <dig>  in this example, two pairs of primer combinations  were not able to amplify a  <dig> -kb and 1-kb fragments  that would be expected if the region was inverted between the genomes. instead, when the primer pairs were switched , a  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb amplicons were amplified from both m. ap k- <dig> and atcc  <dig> . this demonstrates that this region is not inverted in these genomes and that both strains share the orientation of this region suggested by the optical map of atcc  <dig>  we cloned and sequenced these amplicons from both genomes and confirmed that sequences flanking the proposed inversion breakpoints are identical in both genomes.

furthermore, to exclude possibilities that the optical mapping results were caused by genomic rearrangements during maintenance of the bacterial strains in our laboratory, we isolated gdna from cultures of m. ap atcc  <dig> and k- <dig> obtained from another laboratory and subjected to pcr analysis. in addition, we analyzed the genomes of three other different clinical isolates  from humans  but with the is <dig> cattle genotype  <cit>  and from a newly isolated strain from a cow . also, the 4b strain was analyzed before using dna microarrays  <cit> . in all cases, the orientation of the inverted segment was agreed with the optical mapping results, indicating that this inversion was not recently introduced into m. ap atcc  <dig> in the laboratory.

alterations of the m. ap k- <dig> genome
on the basis of our analyses, we corrected the assembly of the genome sequence of m. ap k- <dig> starting from map3759c to map <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> , <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp in the genome of m. ap k- <dig> . this region includes the origin of replication and  <dig> predicted orfs. according to our sequencing results, one of the two breakpoints is located between the fourth and fifth base pairs from the 3' end of map0008c . after we revised this region of the genome sequence, the map0008c orf, now named map0008c_a, has a new stop codon located 45-bp downstream the breakpoint. therefore, the map0008c protein is now  <dig> amino acids in length instead of  <dig> residues. complete sequencing of the pcr fragments revealed two consecutively additional copies of orfs, which are >  <dig> % identical to insertion sequences is <dig> and is_map <dig>  located immediately downstream of map3758c . the two novel orfs were named map3758c_a and map3758c_b. as a result, the segment is flanked by two copies of is <dig> . supplementary table two in additional file  <dig> details the order of genes in the inverted region. all new sequences  are deposited in the genbank database .

discussion
diversity of the genomic contents among strains of the same species of pathogens plays an important role in their evolution and could increase the antigenic repertoire of organisms to overcome host immune defenses. genomic rearrangements including insertions/deletions or inversions are usually responsible for genomic diversity that is well-documented in members of m. avium complex including m. ap  <cit> . with the availability of complete genome sequences, pathogen diversity is usually analyzed on a whole-genome level. unfortunately, high throughput sequencing projects are subject to errors and needs continuous improvement as technology progresses. one of the most encountered sequencing errors is single nucleotide miscalls, resulting in frameshifts or additions/deletions of orfs  <cit> . other errors such as inversions and translocations are usually associated with the assembly step of the whole sequence. in this study, we analyzed errors in the m. ap k- <dig> genome that are associated with sequence assembly.

earlier microarray analysis of strains belonging to the m. avium complex identified large regions of insertions/deletions  <cit>  in addition to  <dig> regions of large inversions between m. av and m. ap genomes  <cit> . here, we used optical mapping  <cit>  to examine genomic rearrangements between m. ap k- <dig>  the recently sequenced strain, and atcc  <dig>  the type strain of m. ap. physical mapping has been conducted to compare genomes between m. tuberculosis and m. bovis  <cit>  and between m. tuberculosis and m. leprae  <cit> . by taking the advantages of current technology, we are able to generate a high-resolution physical map of m. ap. earlier, optical mapping was used for large-scale, comparative analysis of several genomes of enteric pathogens revealing loci responsible for serotype conversion <cit> . based on the comparison of genomic maps of m. ap atcc  <dig> and m. ap k- <dig>  both genome sequences shared significant identity on a genome-wide scale at the resolution of the current optical mapping system  <cit> . in fact, combined estimated size of the m. ap atcc  <dig> genomes is only  <dig>  kb  larger than the size of the sequenced m. ap k- <dig> genome.

surprisingly, comparing the generated optical map to the restriction map of the m. ap k- <dig> genome revealed an inversion of a large dna segment . the location of this inversion was close to an inverted region  that was identified earlier when m. ap and m. ah genomes were compared  <cit> . southern blotting, pcr and sequencing analyses did not confirm the difference between these genomes. this suggests two possibilities. one possibility is that there is an error in the assembly of the published m. ap k- <dig> genome sequence and that it should be corrected to reflect the data in this report. a second possibility is that the changes reflect real mutational differences that have occurred during propagation of the m. ap atcc  <dig> in the laboratory. notably, the k- <dig> strain in our lab was obtained from dr. raul barletta, the same origin for the k- <dig> strain used in the genome project . accordingly, we performed pcr analysis on strains k- <dig> and atcc  <dig> maintained in another laboratory as well as clinical isolates from different sources . this analysis confirmed the optical mapping data, resulting in a revised segment that is flanked by is <dig>  suggesting an assembly error is the reason for the inversion.

previously, optical mapping was used to help the assembly of the y. pestis genome  <cit> , a strategy that was not applied for m. ap k- <dig> sequencing project  <cit> . interestingly, the map <dig> gene and the origin of replication are included in the inverted region, which is usually used to dictate the orientation of genes in the genome. however, the oric region and conserved sequences involved in replication   <cit>  remained intact in the revised sequence, therefore, the inversion of this region should not interfere with dna replication. we suggest maintaining the same gene identification numbers in the inverted region to avoid confusions caused by changes. however, the genome sequence web portal should contain all of the information gathered from optical mapping . annotators and investigators interested in genomic synteny should be aware of the inversion in the assembled genome of m. ap k- <dig> strain. alternatively, we could reassign the complete locus tags with a distinct prefix to reflect the revised gene order and orientation. however, this task will require the re-naming of the whole genome of m. ap k- <dig>  further inspection of the correctly assembled genome identified two additional copies of genes that were paralogues to known genes in m. ap k- <dig> genome, suggesting a gene duplication or transposition event. the importance of such gene duplication events remains to be analyzed in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in general, optical mapping used here validated the genome sequence of m. ap k- <dig> and showed its overall identity to the un-sequenced genome of m. ap atcc  <dig>  additionally, this study revealed differences from the published m. ap k- <dig> genome that should be further investigated. specifically, the revised map0008c is  <dig> bp longer than the previously published one, and the additional sequence does not match to any known homologous domain, thus impact on the function of map0008c remains unknown. despite the lower resolution level of optical mapping  compared to whole-genome sequence analysis , optical mapping provides a less expensive approach to studying genomic rearrangements. we strongly support the notion of using physical mapping-based protocols to complement projects of whole-genome sequencing.
