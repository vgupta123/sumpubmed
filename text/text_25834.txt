BACKGROUND
screening individuals that are naturally occurring across environmental and altitudinal gradients for differential gene expression is one approach proposed for the preliminary identification of candidate genes important in adaptive diversification and plastic responses  <cit> . implementing this approach may involve large numbers of comparisons and thus requires a cost effective means of expression profiling.

two variations on high throughput sequencing of short cdna fragments – rna-seq and tag profiling – both require small amounts of rna, and have the potential to identify low abundance transcripts and/or provide for analysis of a large number of samples  <cit> . unlike microarrays, there are no background and cross-hybridisation problems and there is the potential to interrogate any transcript that is expressed as opposed to the interrogation of pre-selected probes  <cit> . these approaches are potentially available for any organism.

studies have already demonstrated that sequencing tags  produces more robust results and detects more differentially expressed genes than several different microarray platforms, particularly when using a con-specific reference genome/transcriptome to which tags can be aligned  <cit> . for example, in one tag profiling study with mice that used a con-specific reference, the collective percentage of ambiguously or non-mapping and thus non-informative tags was as little as 12%  <cit> . however, even with rapidly increasing sequencing capacity, decreasing sequencing costs, and initiatives such as the 1kp project  most non-crop and non-model species still lack phylogenetically close reference transcriptomes/genomes. an important question is whether or not a more distantly related transcriptome can be used effectively when profiling short rna/cdna sequences.

sequence tags  also pose analytical challenges  <cit>  and while tag profiling protocols have been developed on several new generation sequencing platforms  <cit> , their principles of analysis differ. here we show and discuss the complex nature of tag sequences generated using the iilumina digital gene expression  – tag profiling protocol  <cit> . we profile natural populations of two closely related species – pachycladon fastigiatum and pachycladon enysii - which are members of a small allopolyploid genus , native to the southern alps of new zealand. all pachycladon species formed very recently   <cit>  and presumably this has been an adaptive radiation  <cit> . we use expression profiling as a means to predict differences in adaptive traits between pachycladon species. p. fastigiatum and p. enysii are known to differ in their altitudinal preferences and in their glucosinolate metabolism  <cit> . differences in glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysis had been predicted by a heterologous microarray study and subsequently confirmed by hplc. in this tag profiling study, we analyse the same cdna samples that were previously investigated with arabidopsis 70mer oligonucleotide microarrays  <cit> .

we evaluate how effective 20mer tag sequencing is for identifying candidate genes and biological processes when  a distant but well annotated transcriptome  is used as a reference,  when a reference transcriptome for p. fastigiatum generated with rna-seq is used, and  when partial sequences instead of full length transcripts are used.

methods
sample preparation
rna from three native populations of p. enysii  and p. fastigiatum  was isolated as described in  <cit> . rnas from multiple accessions of each species were pooled  <cit>  and underwent sample preparation according to manufacturer’s instructions . mrna was isolated from total rna and dpnii-restricted to generate dpnii-anchored tags which were then enriched for sequencing. after tag library construction, libraries were titrated resulting in three flow cell lanes being loaded for each species. cluster generation and sequencing were conducted according to illumina protocols . the sequence reads are available at the arrayexpress database  under the accession number e-mtab- <dig> 

reference genes
four sets of reference genes were used for mapping. first,  <dig>  full length reference genes obtained by illumina short read sequencing of p. fastigiatum were extracted from an est library  <cit> . two homeologous copies were found for  <dig> of these genes resulting in a total set of  <dig>  p. fastigiatum reference ests . their a. thaliana homologues were identified using blast  <cit>  and extracted from the tair <dig> database  <cit>  and represent the second set of reference genes. the third set of reference genes contained all contigs longer than 200 bp in the p. fastigiatum est library , while a fourth set consisted of the cdnas of all  <dig>  gene models in the tair <dig> database.

read quality, mapping and counting
the base calling quality for each position in 18 bp reads from all six lanes was assessed using the program dynamictrim  <cit> . since the sequencing protocol artificially added two nucleotides to the end of each read, these two bases were clipped giving high quality tags of 16 bp in length . as all tags must begin with a dpnii restriction site that cleaves 3′ of gatc, the sequence gatc was added to the beginning of each read resulting in a length of  <dig> bases for every tag. these tags were mapped for each individual lane to the full length ests  of p. fastigiatum without allowing any mismatches  as well as allowing for one mismatch when mapping the tags of p. enysii , and to the corresponding a. thaliana tair <dig> orthologues allowing no , one  and two  mismatches using bowtie v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the tags were also mapped without  and with one mismatch in the p. enysii tags  to all available contigs of p. fastigiatum  as well as to all cdna sequences of the tair <dig> database  allowing for no , one  and two  mismatches. all reads that mapped to more than one gene locus were discarded whereas reads mapping to both homeologous copies were counted once. when reads were mapped against all p. fastigiatum contigs, a read was counted if it uniquely mapped to a contig that was homologous to a specific arabidopsis gene. if several contigs representing the same gene had reads mapping to them, the read counts were added to obtain the total count for the gene.

an in silico dpnii digestion of the  <dig>  p. fastigiatum – a. thaliana orthologues was carried out to reveal the distribution of dpnii sites in reference genes. this distribution is shown in additional file  <dig> and indicates that dpnii sites were absent in some genes and occurred more than 20x in  <dig> p. fastigiatum and  <dig> a. thaliana genes.

according to the illumina dpnii sample preparation protocol, only the tag anchored to the 3′ most dpnii site should remain attached to the bead and be sequenced  <cit> . however, for most reference genes, tags mapping to several dpnii sites per gene were recovered with the 3′ most tag often not being the most abundant tag . this phenomenon has been previously observed and ascribed to both incomplete digestion by dpnii as well as the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites per gene  <cit> . therefore, when obtaining counts for individual gene loci, instead of counting only the 3′ most tag or the most abundant tag, we summed all tags that mapped to a locus regardless of their positions within the gene. this also compensated for the loss of tag positions due to sequence divergence when using heterospecific reference transcriptomes of a. thaliana.

in cases where tags mapped to the same position, but one group of tags was oriented in the forward direction and one group in the reverse direction, both positions and counts were combined into one. our goals were to 1) quantify the expression of a particular gene locus irrespective of alternative splicing variants or homoelogous copies making up that locus, 2) compare the expression of genes between this tag profiling and a previous microarray study and 3) quantify the expression of separate homeologous gene copies present at the same locus. thus, we first distinguished between locus-specific tags  and locus copy-specific tags . then, for goals  <dig> and  <dig>  locus-specific and locus copy-specific tags of both copies were added to obtain the locus count. for the analysis of homeologous copies  see paragraph below.

analysis of differentially expressed genes 
differential gene expression analyses were made with r using the bioconductor software package edger  <cit> . the methods implemented in edger  <cit>  assume tag count data to be described by an overdispersed negative binomial distribution. a maximum likelihood procedure was used to estimate common dispersion conditional on total tag counts ; log <dig> and log <dig> represent corrected tag proportions for p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively; prope and propf reflect count averages across the three replicate lanes per species. an exact test analogous to fisher’s exact test, but for overdispersed data, was used to assess differential gene expression. conditioning on the pseudo-data totals over all libraries, the test calculates the probability of observing sample totals as or more extreme than that observed in the experiment for each gene . p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the benjamini-hochberg procedure. criteria for differential expression were an absolute m  - log2) value >  <dig>   and an adjusted p-value <  <dig> . this criterion was applied to make interpretation of results comparable with those of a previous microarray study that used a similar threshold. a total of  <dig> datasets were analysed. four datasets resulted from mapping the tags against the collection of full length and partial p. fastigiatum ests either allowing for no mismatch or one mismatch with the p. enysii tags. six datasets resulted from mapping tags against a. thaliana ests orthologous to the full length p. fastigiatum ests and against the complete tair <dig> database allowing for zero, one or two mismatches.

analysis of agreements and discrepancies between sets of degs
to determine to which degree similar degs are identified between the ten different tag profiling datasets as well as tag profiling and a previous microarray analysis we intersected lists of degs for all treatments shown in figure  <dig>  first, we subtracted from the number of degs of the first treatment the number of genes not surveyed by the second treatment. for example,  <dig>  of  <dig>  genes up-regulated in p. enysii with tag profiling  were also surveyed by microarrays while the remaining  <dig> were not. similarly,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes up-regulated in p. enysii with microarrays were also surveyed by tag profiling  while the remaining  <dig> were not. hence, the overlap was calculated between the corrected deg values, namely  <dig>  and  <dig> genes and equalled  <dig> genes. this means that 51% of the microarray results  were confirmed by tag profiling . we always divided the number of overlapping genes by the smaller of the two corrected number of degs. this allowed for a straightforward comparison of percentages .

in addition to cases where two different datasets identified similar degs we also investigated cases for which two methods contradicted one another, i.e. cases for which the first method identifies a gene as up-regulated in p. enysii whereas the second method identifies the same gene as up-regulated in p. fastigiatum and vice versa. to calculate disagreements we intersected ‘opposite’ lists. first, we subtracted from the number of degs of one method the number of genes not surveyed by the other method. for example, the number of genes up-regulated in p. enysii with microarrays and in p. fastigiatum with tag profiling was  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. however, only  <dig> and  <dig> of those were surveyed by the other analysis. hence an overlap between the latter of  <dig> genes means that  <dig> %  of the microarray results were contradicted by tag profiling .

comparison with microarrays
we applied a statistical test to evaluate agreements and disagreements in the results obtained for differential expression from our microarray and tag profiling analyses. using a resampling approach, we calculated a null frequency distribution to determine how likely it was to observe similar and different patterns of gene expression between platforms by chance. y was the number of genes surveyed for differential expression by both platforms . from y, we jackknife resampled n elements  and m elements . we recorded the number of elements that were common to  both resampled datasets. this sampling process was repeated a total of  <dig>  times for each analysis so that an appropriate null frequency distribution could be generated. the actual number  of up-regulated and down-regulated genes suggesting concordance or disagreement between the tag profiling and microarray results were then compared against values of the null frequency distribution to determine significance. the test was performed using a mysql database and perl.

gene-annotation enrichment analysis
the loci found to be up-regulated in p. enysii and p. fastigiatum as well as loci with one homeologous copy up-regulated in p. enysii and the other in p. fastigiatum were subjected to a gene-annotation enrichment analysis using agrigo  <cit> .  <dig>  reference genes that contained a dpnii restriction site were used as population background for the smaller datasets, while all available tair <dig> cdna sequences were used as population background for the large datasets. agrigo analyses were performed for all ten datasets. in addition, a david analysis  <cit>  was done for dataset p <dig>  gene annotations were compared to the curated go database for biological processes  and the kegg database and the classification stringency was set to medium. david analyses identify clusters of go terms that are enriched for either species as well as enriched go terms. for each go term, a fisher’s exact test was performed to determine if a go term occurs significantly more often in the respective set of up-regulated genes than in the est library used as population background. for each cluster of go terms, an enrichment score was determined by calculating the minus log transformation of the geometric mean of all p-values for the go terms in that cluster. a score greater than or equal to  <dig>  is equivalent to  <dig>  on a non-log scale and considered significant. significant clusters and go terms for each species are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of differential expression between homeologous copies
we examined differential gene expression for  <dig> full length homeologous gene pairs in the p. fastigiatum library. of these, all loci for which the number of locus copy-specific tags was greater than five and exceeded the number of copy-unspecific tags by at least fivefold were analysed.  <dig> loci  met this criterion. for five of the  <dig> loci, three divergent sequences were found in the est library . in all cases homeologous copies were less than 95% similar, while a further putative paralogue was less than 90% similar. this interpretation of paralogy is consistent with the presence of a duplicated gene in the genome of arabidopsis lyrata . the counts for these five additional sequences were added to this dataset now comprising  <dig> sequences  which could be analysed for copy-specific differential expression.

RESULTS
read quality assessment
we refer to the processed reads of each lane as ‘tags’, all distinct tags as ‘unique tags’ and the number of occurrences of each unique tag as ‘tag counts’. tags that map to only one locus are called unambiguous tags even if they map to both copies of one locus.

for four of the six lanes on our flow cell more than 90% of the reads met a high quality threshold; only in the lanes with the highest concentrations  was a significant number of reads  discarded . thus the overall quality of the data was very high. in the following we report the results for lanes pe <dig>  pe <dig> and pe3; the results for lanes pf <dig>  pf <dig>  and pf <dig> were similar . we found  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique 20 bp tags  in pe <dig>  pe <dig>  and pe <dig>  respectively.  <dig>   of the unique tags found in pe <dig> were not found in pe <dig> and pe <dig>  and  <dig>   and  <dig>   of the unique tags were only present in pe <dig> and pe <dig>  respectively. there were  <dig>  unique tags common to all three pe lanes.

tag mapping to p. fastigiatum ests
the 20 bp tags were mapped without mismatches against  <dig>  ests of p. fastigiatum representing  <dig>  different gene loci . 26–29%  and 27–31%  of all tags per lane mapped to at least one est . however, about 2% of the tags per lane were excluded from further analyses because they mapped to more than one locus . this resulted in 24–27%  and 26–30%  unambiguous tags per lane to be analyzed for differential expression . tag counts were obtained for  <dig>  p. fastigiatum reference genes  as  <dig> reference genes did not contain a dpnii site . a further  <dig> reference genes, with at least one dpnii site, had no tag mapping to them.

to accommodate possible snps between the two pachycladon species we also mapped the tags of p. enysii with up to one mismatch to the p. fastigiatum references ests . the percentage of mapped p. enysii tags increased from 26–29% in p <dig> to 33–37% in p <dig>  with 3% of the tags mapping ambiguously . allowing for one mismatch increased the number of genes surveyed to  <dig>  .

most contigs in a de novo assembled est library do not represent full length transcripts. in order to test whether partial transcripts could be used as a reference for tag profiling, we mapped tags against all available contigs, first without allowing for mismatches in both species  and then with up to one mismatch in p. enysii . using this approach,  <dig>  and  <dig>  different genes were surveyed, respectively . with the pl <dig> approach, 64–70%  and 64–75%  of the tags mapped to at least one contig, and 53–58%  and 54–62%  mapped unambiguously. allowing for one mismatch in the p. enysii tags increased the percentage of mapped tags to 73–82% and the percentage of unambiguously mapping tags to 60–71%.

mapping with zero or one mismatch against full length transcripts or all available contigs, the gene with the highest number of tags mapping for both pachycladon species was at1g <dig> , a gene that functions in cell elongation and plant development  <cit> . other genes to which a high number of tags mapped differed slightly depending on whether a mismatch was allowed and on whether full length transcripts or all available contigs were used as a reference. using the smaller reference sets , at1g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  harboured a high number of tags in p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively, while at2g <dig>  had high counts in both species. in the p <dig> dataset a very high number of p. enysii tags also mapped to at2g <dig> . using the larger references sets , the second and third most highly expressed genes were at5g <dig>  and at2g <dig>  in p. enysii and at2g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  in p. fastigiatum.

tag mapping to a. thaliana ests
the 20 bp tags were also mapped against the  <dig>  orthologous genes of a. thaliana and all cdna sequences of the tair <dig> database allowing for no , one  and two  mismatches. the results for these mappings differed considerably to the mappings against the p. fastigiatum ests . if no mismatches were allowed, only about 9%  or 15%  of the tags mapped to a gene of a. thaliana. when allowing for one mismatch and using the small dataset , the percentages increased to 20-24%  and 19–23% . when two mismatches were allowed , the number of tags mapping was 48–63% in p. enysii and 49–60% in p. fastigiatum. when allowing for one mismatch and using the large dataset , the percentages increased to 30–34%  and 28–34% . when two mismatches were allowed , the number of tags mapping was 58–65% in p. enysii and 55–64% in p. fastigiatum. using the reduced a. thaliana reference set of genes, 4%, 10%, and 14%  of the tags were available for analysis after excluding the ambiguously mapping tags. this contrasted with 10–11%, 24–28%, and 38–45%  when the entire tair  <dig> dataset was used.

when using the small a. thaliana dataset, the number of genes surveyed for gene expression increased with the number of allowed mismatches during mapping  but did not reach the number of genes analyzed when using the small p. fastigiatum dataset. using the large arabidopsis dataset,  <dig>  genes were surveyed in al <dig>   <dig>  in al <dig>  and  <dig>  in al <dig> .

with the small arabidopsis reference transcriptome, the most highly expressed genes differed from those found with the p. fastigiatum reference transcriptome and between the different datasets. in particular, with no mismatches between the reference and the tags  the gene with the most tags in p. enysii was at3g <dig> , while in p. fastigiatum it was at1g <dig> . when allowing for one mismatch  the highest numbers of tags in both species was observed for the photosystem ii protein psbw . however, when allowing for two mismatches , the most highly expressed gene in both species was the same as with the p. fastigiatum reference ests, namely at1g <dig> . tags mapping to esp in p. enysii were less than a hundred in the a <dig> and a <dig> datasets and zero in the a <dig> dataset. also, less than four hundred tags mapped to esm <dig> in p. fastigiatum in the a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> datasets.

using all coding sequences of tair <dig> as a reference, the genes with the highest expression level in the al <dig> dataset were at5g <dig>  and at3g <dig>  for p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively. when one and two mismatches were allowed, the gene with the highest expression level in both species was at2g <dig>  a transposable element gene.

summary of results with different reference transcriptomes
with p. fastigiatum ests as a reference, many tags mapped  while few tags  mapped ambiguously, even when mismatches were allowed in the p. enysii tags. with a. thaliana ests as a reference, considerably fewer tags mapped and although the number of mapped tags increased when allowing for mismatches during mapping so did the number of ambiguous tags. for example, with the small reference set, 48–63% of all tags per lane mapped when two mismatches were allowed, but only about 14% of them mapped unambiguously and could thus be used for the differential expression analysis. with the large reference set and two mismatches allowed, the numbers improved  but did not reach the numbers obtained when using the large set of partial p. fastigiatum ests .

the analysis of the genes with the highest expression levels did not show significant differences between the pachycladon datasets but was significantly different between the pachycladon and the arabidopsis datasets. an investigation of the reference and tag sequences of the esp, esm <dig>  and fip <dig> genes revealed several explanations for this . a deletion in the arabidopsis esp gene at the most abundant tag position led to zero counts for esp in the datasets with no mismatch allowed. with one and two mismatches, additional tags mapping to other positions were counted. the most abundant tag in the esm <dig> gene showed three snps between the pachycladon and the a. thaliana sequence. again, additional tags mapped to other positions in the a. thaliana reference esm <dig> regardless of the number of mismatches allowed. two mismatches and an insertion at the most abundant position in the a. thaliana est led to low counts for the fip <dig> gene.

in summary, using a distant reference transcriptome resulted in a) fewer tags mapping, b) some genes not being surveyed for differential expression and c) lower than expected levels of expression for genes whose most abundant mapping position was not conserved. nevertheless, the greater size of the arabidopsis transcriptome compared with the ones generated for pachycladon meant that the scope of the differential gene expression analysis was much larger with the heterospecific than with the conspecific reference transcriptome.

differential expression analysis
locus counts were assessed for differential expression by applying an exact test based on negative binomial distributions of count data as implemented in the r package edger  <cit> . for each gene, the log fold change  was calculated as log2-log <dig> with prope and propf representing the proportions of that gene in the p. enysii and p. fastigiatum tag library, respectively. the library sizes for each of the six lanes resulted from summing all locus counts for a particular lane and were different for each of the ten datasets . in order to investigate the impact of a) the use of a relatively distant reference dataset and b) the use of partial contigs on the differential expression analysis we compared the amount and overlap of the differentially expressed genes  found with each of the ten datasets summarized in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of tag profiling datasets: numbers of degs
using only full length transcripts of p. fastigiatum and allowing for no mismatch  we inferred  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes for p. fastigiatum and p. enysii, respectively. when one mismatch was allowed in the p. enysii tags  these numbers increased to  <dig>  and  <dig>  . when mapping the tags without mismatches against all available p. fastigiatum contigs that were longer than 200 bp , representing the leaf transcriptome of this species,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were inferred to be differentially expressed . interestingly, allowing for one mismatch in p. enysii led to a decrease in the number of degs in p. fastigiatum  and an increase in p. enysii  .

using the small arabidopsis reference dataset, only very few differentially expressed genes were identified.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs were inferred in p. fastigiatum and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs were inferred in p. enysii in the a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> datasets, respectively . when the tags were mapped against the  <dig>  cdna sequences, representing the complete a. thaliana transcriptome, these numbers increased to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in p. fastigiatum and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in p. enysii . thus in both the small and the large a. thaliana reference sets, the number of degs inferred increased with an increasing number of mismatches allowed . this increase was stronger in the large a. thaliana reference sets .

comparison of tag profiling datasets: agreements and discrepancies between sets of degs
when comparing degs inferred for different datasets it is important to not only compare their number but also whether the same genes are inferred to be up-regulated between different datasets. for example, although the number of degs inferred with datasets p <dig> and p <dig> suggests a high degree of similarity, only  <dig> and  <dig> genes are up-regulated in both datasets for p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively. we computed the number of overlapping genes in pairwise comparisons of all ten datasets . for the genes up-regulated in p. fastigiatum, the highest overlap to the p <dig> dataset was 80% with pl <dig>  the overlap of p <dig> with the three small a. thaliana datasets was higher  than the overlap between pl <dig> and the large a. thaliana datasets . overall, the overlap between all p. fastigiatum datasets and the large a. thaliana datasets was only 44–55% indicating that the type of degs identified strongly differed depending on the reference set. the analysis of overlaps between up-regulated genes in p. enysii showed similar results .

not only was the overlap between the sets of up-regulated genes low for some comparisons but there were also discrepancies, i.e. cases in which one gene was inferred to be up-regulated in p. enysii in one dataset but in p. fastigiatum in the other. although percentages of disagreements were low for most comparisons  there were many discrepancies between the large references sets . surprisingly there was also some disagreement between pl <dig> and pl <dig> .

agreements and discrepancies between tag profiling and microarray analysis
to determine the degree of concordance between tag profiling and microarray analysis, we intersected lists of degs obtained with both methods and calculated confirmation percentages as above. all percentages were statistically significant irrespective of the reference set used, i.e. the overlap was higher than expected to occur by chance when intersecting lists of the respective sizes. with p. fastigiatum sequences as references the confirmation percentages were higher than with a. thaliana reference sets . as found for the number of genes surveyed and the number of differentially expressed genes, confirmation percentages increased with an increasing number of mismatches in the a. thaliana datasets . interestingly, with pachycladon references, confirmation percentages were slightly higher in p. fastigiatum than in p. enysii  but with a. thaliana references, confirmation percentages were similar in p. fastigiatum and p. enysii .

in addition to cases for which microarray analyses and tag profiling identified the same degs, we also investigated cases for which both methods contradicted each other. to calculate disagreements we intersected ‘opposite’ lists. all intersections were not statistically significant, e. g. they were not higher than expected by chance when intersecting lists of the respective sizes. disagreements were higher in p. fastigiatum than p. enysii across all datasets . also, disagreements were more variable when using a. thaliana reference sets as opposed to using p. fastigiatum reference sets .

gene enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes
a gene-annotation enrichment analysis  was conducted to determine whether tag profiling analyses indicated similar ontologies as predicted from microarray analyses of the same rna samples.

annotations of a. thaliana for the  <dig>  and  <dig>  up-regulated genes of p. fastigiatum and p. enysii, respectively  were analysed using david  <cit>  against the curated go database for biological processes  and the kegg reference database. go annotations were found for  <dig>  of the  <dig>  reference loci that were used as a population background and for  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  up-regulated genes. seven clusters in p. fastigiatum and one in p. enysii, had a significant enrichment score greater than  <dig>  or contained go terms with a p-value smaller than  <dig>  . the cluster with the highest enrichment score  in p. fastigiatum contained genes belonging to go terms associated with ‘regulation of transcription’, while the second highest scoring cluster contained genes for the go term ‘response to water deprivation’ which was also enriched in the microarray analysis. these genes included erd <dig> and erd <dig>  as well as the genes rd <dig> and rd <dig> . another cluster with a significant enrichment score  harboured genes associated with ‘defense response to fungus’. other clusters with significant go terms were associated with ‘nucleoside metabolic process‘, ‘response to fungus‘, ‘response to hydrogen peroxide‘, and ‘response to oxidative stress‘. in p. enysii the only cluster with an enrichment score higher than  <dig>   contained go terms associated with ‘macromolecular complex subunit organisation‘.

in summary, p. fastigiatum was most significantly enriched for go terms associated with stress responses in various forms  while no such go terms were found enriched in p. enysii.

further insight concerning differences in support for ontology inferences can best be gained and illustrated by reference to specific examples .

glucosinolate metabolism
glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products have been implicated in defense against herbivores and pathogens. nine marker genes for glucosinolate metabolism that were differentially expressed in our previous microarray study were found to have identical expression patterns in most tag profiling datasets . these include the esm <dig> gene, a marker for isothiocyanate production  which was inferred to be up-regulated in p. fastigiatum in all ten datasets. the mvp <dig> gene  a myrosinase associated protein specifically interacting with tgg <dig>  was also up-regulated in p. fastigiatum in all datasets except a <dig> and al <dig>  the esp gene , a marker for nitrile production  <cit>  as well as two marker genes for the production of methionine-derived glucosinolates with four carbon atoms  were up-regulated in p. enysii in all datasets except a <dig> and al <dig> and two other marker genes for c <dig> glucosinolates  were up-regulated in p. enysii in all datasets. at1g <dig>  was up-regulated in p. enysii in the pl <dig> dataset and at4g <dig>  was up-regulated in p. enysii in the al <dig> and al <dig> datasets.

both microarray analyses and tag profiling identified differentially expressed glucosinolate metabolism genes not observed with the other method . with tag profiling five additional genes were inferred to be up-regulated in p. fastigiatum , at1g <dig> , at4g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at5g <dig> ). with tag profiling twelve additional genes were inferred to be up-regulated in p. enysii , at1g <dig> , at2g <dig> , at3g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at5g <dig> ; at5g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at5g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at1g <dig> ,  <cit> ).

the homologs to at1g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at2g <dig> , at3g <dig> , and at4g <dig>   <cit>  were up-regulated in p. enysii in the microarray analysis only. contradictory results were obtained for the homologue to at1g <dig>  a myrosinase-associated protein closely related to esm <dig> and mvp <dig>  as it was up-regulated in p. fastigiatum in the microarray analysis but in p. enysii when measured by tag profiling.

populations of p. fastigiatum grow at a mean altitude of  <dig>  m, while p. enysii grows between heights of  <dig>  and  <dig>  m  <cit> . both plants, but p. enysii much more so, are subject to cold temperatures. an enrichment of go terms corresponding to cold stimulus was detected in the microarray experiment for p. fastigiatum <cit> . while this go term was not enriched with tag profiling, two genes involved in cold tolerance in a. thaliana  and at1g <dig>   <cit> ) were up-regulated in p. fastigiatum in all tag profiling datasets. up-regulation of at1g <dig> was also detected in p. fastigiatum with the microarray. other genes related to cold tolerance and inferred to be up-regulated in most, but not all tag profiling datasets were at1g <dig> , at1g <dig> , at2g <dig> , at4g <dig> , at2g <dig> , and at4g <dig>  in p. fastigiatum and at4g <dig> , at2g <dig> , and at1g <dig>  in p. enysii. the gene xero <dig>  was only found up-regulated in p. fastigiatum in the microarray analysis but not with tag profiling. these results suggest that, although genes implicated in cold tolerance were up-regulated in both species, the response to cold was more substantial in p. fastigiatum.

flower development
a process not detected from differential expression or ontology analyses of the heterologous microarrays, but detected by tag profiling was flower induction. at4g <dig> , a gene that promotes flowering by repressing flowering locus c   <cit>  was up-regulated in p. enysii in all datasets except a <dig> and a <dig>  flc was up-regulated in p. fastigiatum in all datasets except a <dig> and al <dig>  another gene known to be a repressor of flowering locus c, at3g <dig>  was also up-regulated in p. enysii in datasets pl <dig> and pl <dig>  because of their higher altitude, p. enysii populations are covered with snow for the most part of the year leaving a relatively short timeframe to develop flowers and seeds. although plants for both species were collected at the same time of year, and prior to flowering, up-regulation of genes that induce flowering in p. enysii may be indicative of an earlier flowering time for this species.

analysis of homeologous gene copies
we investigated  <dig> homeologous gene pairs and five gene triplets consisting of two homeologues and one paralogue for copy-specific expression. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> and  <dig> were up-regulated in p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively, whereas  <dig> copies were not differentially expressed. for  <dig> and  <dig> pairs, both copies were up-regulated in p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively. for  <dig> and  <dig> pairs, one copy was up-regulated in p. enysii and p. fastigiatum, respectively, whereas the other copy was not differentially expressed. for  <dig> pairs one copy was up-regulated in one species while the other was up-regulated in the other species .

myrosinase-associated proteins  which function in glucosinolate metabolism had a variable number of homeologous copies in the p. fastigiatum est library: none for at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  one for at1g <dig>  at3g <dig>  and at3g <dig> , and three for at1g <dig> . two of the mvp <dig> sequences are most similar to a homologue on chromosome  <dig> in a. thaliana but the third mvp <dig> sequence is most similar to a gene in the arabidopsis lyrata genome that precedes the esm <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  differential expression for some of the myap copies was observed. at1g <dig> was up-regulated in p. enysii whereas one of the homeologous mvp <dig> was up-regulated in p. fastigiatum. the highest number of tags mapped to the third mvp <dig> copy that was also up-regulated in p. fastigiatum. myrosinase tgg <dig>  which is known to interact with mvp <dig>  <cit> , was not present in the p. fastigiatum est library. however, one copy of myrosinase tgg <dig> was up-regulated in p. enysii.

for four a. thaliana genes - at1g <dig> , at3g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at3g <dig> - genes, three homologous sequences had been assembled in the p. fastigiatum est library. all three sequences homologous to at1g <dig>  two sequences homologous to at3g <dig> and one sequence homologous to at1g <dig> were up-regulated in p. enysii. of the at3g <dig> homologs, one was up-regulated in p. enysii, one was up-regulated in p. fastigiatum and the third was not differentially expressed.

discussion
tag profiling as a method for expression profiling
tag profiling as a means to study differential gene expression  <cit>  has been successfully applied in bats  <cit> , maize  <cit> , planthoppers  <cit> , honey bees  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . however, tag profiling is only one of a number of alternative approaches for expression profiling. microarrays have been the gold standard in the past and more recently rna-seq has gained increasing popularity  <cit> . our study of 20mer tag profiles for two closely related nz alpine brassicaceae – pachycladon enysii and pachycladon fastigiatum – suggests that not only is tag sequencing superior to microarray analyses, but in some cases can be expected to have significant advantages over rna-seq.

as previously stated there are several shortcomings to microarray technologies  <cit> . with hybridization-based methods, genes with low expression levels cannot be analysed whereas with sequencing-based methods even absence of expression can be distinguished from low expression and expression can be detected over several orders of magnitude. this much greater dynamic range of sequencing approaches over microarrays has led to predictions that the former will eventually replace the latter  <cit> . consistent with a higher dynamic range, we observed more differentially expressed genes with tag profiling  than with the earlier heterologous microarray study .

one limitation of the tag sequencing protocol used in the present study is the dependence on the presence of a dpnii or nlaiii restriction site in the transcript. thus  <dig> % of our reference genes were unavailable for analysis. this limitation and others, such as ease in multiplexing samples, are reasons that some researchers are pursuing other tag sequencing protocols such as cage and supersage  <cit> . irrespective of the best protocol used for generating short sequence tags, our study provides insight into the potential of short tag sequencing as a method for investigating and inferring differential expression when different reference transcriptomes are available.

in our current work we are interested in studying plant responses to environmental variation - studies that require a large number of sample comparisons. hence finding a reliable and cost effective profiling method is important. although high throughput sequencing is becoming more affordable, tag sequencing has cost advantages over rna-seq analyses. the sequencing of 20–30 bp tags provides much greater sequencing depth and also decreases the complexity of the differential expression analysis compared to analyses based on random 75–150 bp rna-seq reads  <cit> . for example, the statistics needed to analyse rna-seq experiments are known to introduce a length bias, with longer genes having a higher probability of being inferred to be differentially expressed  <cit> . this problem does not affect tag sequencing.

however, are 20mer sequence tags sufficient in length for purposes such as we are interested? previously it has been stated that 20mer sequence tags cannot be effectively used for profiling species when a same species reference transcriptome is not available  <cit> . our results do not support this conclusion. as we discuss in the following section, the choice of reference transcriptome and mapping parameters have important implications for biological inferences.

the choice of a reference transcriptome
developing tag-based approaches to gene expression profiling in a new species or group of closely related species requires consideration to be given to what type of reference library is being used. it is not clear a) if a heterospecific but complete and well annotated transcriptome can serve as a reference, b) how much information is lost by using such a distant reference, c) how using a less well developed but conspecific reference library compares to using a heterospecific library and d) what mapping parameters should be used in both cases. we addressed all of these aspects in our study.

for mapping we used four different reference transcriptomes: 1) an est library of  <dig>  full-length ests of pachycladon fastigiatum leaf tissue, 2) orthologous cdna sequences from arabidopsis thaliana, 3) all partial contigs of p. fastigiatum that have been assembled from 75 bp reads in our lab, and 4) all transcripts available in the tair <dig> database. given that pachycladon is an allopolyploid genus  <cit> , we expected to find two copies from different parental genomes  for many genes.  <dig> homeologous pairs were represented among the full lengths cdnas in our est library. a. thaliana and p. fastigiatum reference ests were on average 90% identical. while homeologous copies within one pachycladon species had about 90% identical sites, the respective orthologous genes in different species, e.g. p. fastigiatum and p. cheesemanii, were up to 98% identical  <cit> . therefore we were optimistic to not only be able to map p. enysii tags to p. fastigiatum ests but also to acquire different tag counts for the homeologous copies of some genes for both species. mapping tags to p. fastigiatum full length sequences was in many ways superior to mapping tags to the orthologous a. thaliana transcripts. less data were lost . less tags mapped ambiguously . more genes could be analyzed for differential expression . more differentially expressed genes were found  and previous microarray results were more clearly confirmed .

increasing the number of mismatches between pachycladon tags and a. thaliana transcripts had positive as well as negative consequences; the percentage of mapped tags increased but so did the number of ambiguous mappings. also, the number of genes surveyed increased although not up to the number used in the analysis of p. fastigiatum full lengths ests. when mapping against the distant reference, some tag positions were lost and thus these did not contribute to the total tag count for a gene. for example, because the number of snps in the most abundant tag position of the esm <dig> gene exceeded the number of mismatches allowed, expression levels for esm <dig> were wrongly detected as being very low although the gene was still identified as differentially expressed in p. fastigiatum. similarly for esp, the most abundant tag position was not counted because of a deletion in the a. thaliana ortholog. however, despite an underestimation of expression for esp, differential expression in p. enysii was still detected due to other low abundant tag positions mapping to the a. thaliana ortholog. both, esp and esm <dig> are markers for adaptive phenotypes  <cit> .

mapping against the entire collection of p. fastigiatum ests  was successful as long as the partial contigs had a restriction site and were reliably annotated. although the detection of differential expression was possible, gene expression levels may have been underestimated as tag counts may have been incomplete. care was taken in that reads mapping to overlapping contigs of the same gene were not counted twice. by not restricting our analysis to full-length ests, the number of genes amenable to study increased as did the number of degs. for example, we were able to measure differential expression of the glucosinolate metabolism gene soc <dig>  and the repressor of flowering locus c  in p. enysii, two genes potentially involved in adaptive processes.

when extending our analysis to the complete collection of a. thaliana gene models, we were able to monitor even more genes for differential expression than with all p. fastigiatum reference ests. also amongst those additional genes were genes of potential adaptive significance as the aop <dig> gene which we expected to be up-regulated in p. enysii from our previous microarray analysis but which did not assemble in our p. fastigiatum reference library. only with the large a. thaliana reference sets and allowing for one or two mismatches, this gene was correctly identified as being differentially expressed in p. enysii. however, as was the case for the small a. thaliana reference sets, with an increasing number of mismatches, the number of ambiguously mapping tags increased.

taken together, our findings demonstrate that the construction of a reference transcriptome for the focal species  is preferable to using a reference transcriptome with 90% similarity to the focal species. in particular, if the goal is to identify genes involved in adaptive processes, a conspecific reference transcriptome is desirable as these genes often evolve sequence differences between species . partial conspecific reference sequences should be included as additional insights can be gained. however, if it is necessary to use a heterospecific reference transcriptome, our experience suggests that it is important that mapping parameters  are optimized to maximize both the scope  and reliability  of the analysis. wang et al. mapped tags derived from bat mrna to well annotated mouse and human references   <cit> . this approach while successful and informative, would have limited their analysis to genes conserved between the reference and species of interest excluding for example those genes that are present only in the analysed species due to a higher ploidy level or to recent duplications of single genes.

does tag profiling provide more biological insights than microarrays?
our gene ontology analysis of tag profiles revealed similar major go terms to be enriched in p. enysii and p. fastigiatum as with microarray-derived expression profiles  <cit> . finer resolution go analyses also identified similar enriched go terms between both platforms. most notably these were stress response go terms such as response to dessication/water deprivation and response to oxidation in p. fastigiatum.

since both analyses differed in scope - the microarray analysis gave results for  <dig>  loci while only  <dig>  different gene loci were included in the est library of p. fastigiatum and were hit by at least one tag – comparisons were possible for  <dig>  loci. twentyone to 60% of the genes up-regulated in the microarray analyses were also up-regulated in the tag profiling analysis with percentages varying with different reference gene sets. we also detected a low level of disagreement between tag profiling and microarray results  but in contrast to all agreements that were statistically significant, the disagreements did not exceed those expected to occur by chance.

to further compare inferences from both gene expression technologies we investigated the expression of genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism, cold tolerance and flowering as these are traits of potential adaptive significance in the divergence of both species. conclusions of biological significance, namely, the difference in glucosinolate hydrolysis products  and chain length of glucosinolates , which had been predicted by the differential expression of underlying genes in the microarray analysis, could also be drawn from our tag profiling studies as similar gene expression patterns were found. in addition to those confirmed genes, with tag profiling another set of glucosinolate metabolism genes was inferred to be differentially expressed. another chain elongation locus  and nitrile specifier  were up-regulated in p. enysii supporting the prediction of c <dig> glucosinolate production and nitrile formation. interestingly, tag profiling results predict p. enysii and p. fastigiatum to use different flavin-monooxygenases to catalyze the conversion of methylthioalkyl glucosinolates to methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates . other interesting findings by tag profiling include the up-regulation of ref <dig>  which links phenylpropanoid and glucosinolate metabolism, and of mam <dig>  which mediates the synthesis of long-chain methionine glucosinolates in p. fastigiatum and the up-regulation of two other loci of the glucosinolate core pathway  and a myrosinase  in p. enysii. moreover, a suite of glucosinolate metabolism genes involved in fungal defense  were inferred to be up-regulated with tag profiling in p. enysii. thus the earlier findings of a significantly different defence response between p. fastigiatum and p. enysii were corroborated by the tag profiling analysis. due to the higher number of differentially expressed genes found in p. enysii with tag profiling the up-regulation of the glucosinolate pathway becomes more obvious. similarly, a greater number of genes involved in cold tolerance were differentially expressed with tag profiling as compared to microarrays. the differential expression of flowering genes had not been detected with the microarrays and may indicate different onsets of flowering in both species.

another advantage of tag profiling over microarrays was the surveillance of homeologous copies for differential expression by computational analysis alone. a few microarray and est library studies have attempted the distinct quantification of homeologous copies, most notably with cotton  <cit>  and coffee  <cit> . however with the microarray studies, copy-specific probes had to be designed prior to the expression analysis which is not necessary with tag profiling. in our study this is best illustrated with locus at1g <dig> which was up-regulated in p. fastigiatum with the heterologous microarray. with tag profiling we observed that this up-regulation is due to up-regulation in one of the two homeologous copies but not both. moreover, we discovered a third copy of the gene, most probably a paralogue on a different chromosome, to be up-regulated in p. fastigiatum.

with tag profiling, sequence information is obtained alongside with expression levels allowing for a high resolution analysis that renders tag profiling preferable to heterologous microarrays, particularly when studying a non-model organism with no prior sequence information. although measuring dge of homeologous copies was more complicated , we were able to make inferences for  <dig> of the  <dig> gene loci. while  <dig> pairs showed no differential expression between species, in other cases one copy was found to be preferentially expressed over the other. both homeologous copies were up-regulated for  <dig> and  <dig> loci in p. fastigiatum and p. enysii, respectively. while for  <dig> and  <dig> loci, one homeologous gene copy only was up-regulated in p. fastigiatum and p. enysii, respectively. in these cases the other homeologous copy was not differentially expressed. we also detected  <dig> cases with one copy up-regulated in p. fastigiatum and the other in p. enysii. these cases will be subject to further analyses as for most of them no appropriate annotation could be found and thus no conclusion could be drawn about their biological significance.

in summary, biological insights obtained with tag profiling were greater as more genes of potential adaptive significance were found to be differentially expressed than with microarrays. in addition, tag profiling allowed for the analysis of differential expression of many homeologues which was not possible with the heterologous microarrays.

CONCLUSIONS
compared with our findings from an earlier heterologous microarray analysis, tag profiling with 20mer tags offered higher resolution, higher sensitivity, higher dynamic range and the opportunity to study differential expression of homeologues in a non-model species. when pioneering expression studies in a new species, we recommend investing in the construction of an est library that can serve as a reference transcriptome for mapping tags as opposed to using a distant reference transcriptome. here we demonstrated that once the reference est library is in place, tag profiling can be effectively implemented for identifying candidate genes potentially important in biotic and abiotic interactions of non-model plants. rna-seq studies should be considered complementary to tag sequencing protocols. although they are not as cheap and do not offer as great a depth of coverage as tag profiling, they are likely to provide further insights into studies such as the one undertaken here. in particular the increased read length with rna-seq means it should be easier to distinguish splice variants, homeologues and paralogs, including those that show divergence at the  <dig> prime end of their sequences.
