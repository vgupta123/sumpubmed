BACKGROUND
one approach towards a mechanistic understanding of phenotypic changes is evolutionary developmental biology   <cit> . as most of our knowledge is based on a few well-characterized model systems that are separated by large evolutionary distances, evolutionary comparisons are often descriptive and have little functional depth. typically evo-devo approaches aim to characterize the key players or pathways known to be relevant for a given process in one model organism in an evolutionarily distantly related species. as outlined by sommer  <cit>  this often leads to an almost descriptive list of the molecular inventories rather than a functional understanding. for a functional evolutionary comparison of developmental processes it is necessary to study clearly homologous processes in closely related species. this enables the understanding of changes in the regulatory network at a mechanistic level.

we focused on the ttg1-dependent gene regulatory network that is well-described in a. thaliana. here it controls five traits that all have an adaptive value for the plant and are likely to be variable on the one hand, but also interdependent as they are controlled by the same regulatory genes  <cit> . ttg <dig> encodes a wd <dig> protein  <cit> . in a. thaliana ttg <dig> acts together with r2r3-myb and bhlh proteins  to regulate different aspects of epidermal cell differentiation including the production of proanthocyanidin, anthocyanidin, seed coat mucilage, trichomes and root hairs  <cit> . the bhlh factor is represented by three homologous, partially redundant acting genes. tt <dig> regulates seed coat mucilage production, seed coat pigment production and anthocyanin biosynthesis. egl <dig> controls seed coat pigmentation, anthocyanin biosynthesis, trichome and root hair development and gl <dig> is involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, trichome and root hair development. high trait specificity is found for the r2r3-myb factors such that one specific r2r3-myb gene regulates each trait  <cit> . gl <dig> regulates trichome initiation  <cit> , wer the non-root hair development  <cit> , pap <dig> and pap <dig> anthocyanidin production  <cit> , tt <dig> pro-anthocyanidin production and myb <dig> regulates seed coat mucilage production  <cit> . during trichome and root hair development additional r <dig> single repeat mybs are important as negative regulators mediating cellular interactions during pattern formation  <cit> .

the function of the mbw complex in epidermal cell differentiation is evolutionary conserved in plants, though their regulation of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin production seems to be the most ancient function. this is suggested by the finding that the mbw complex in maize is only involved in anthocyanin production  <cit> , in petunia in anthocyanidin and proanthocyanidin production  <cit>  and in a. thaliana in all five traits  <cit> . based on the phylogenetic tree of the myb proteins, serna and martin suggested that the additional role of the mbw complex in trichome formation has been adopted after the asterid-rosid division  <cit> . this view is supported by the findings that gl <dig>  or c <dig>  overexpression in tobacco has no effect on trichome formation  <cit> . conversely, overexpression of ttg <dig> homologs from various species has been successfully used to complement the corresponding a. thaliana mutant phenotypes. these include an <dig> from petunia hybrida <cit> , pac <dig> from maize  <cit> , ghttg <dig> and ghttg <dig> from gossypium hirsutum . we demonstrate that all five traits are affected in two aattg <dig> alleles in a. alpina. as considerable phenotypic variation was already observed for some of these traits between different members of the brassicaceae family  <cit>  we did a detailed phenotypic description of the five traits to provide a reference for future studies. our analysis revealed striking differences in the case of trichome and root hair patterning in a. alpina as compared to a. thaliana.

RESULTS
identification of aattg <dig> mutants in a. alpina
to initiate a genetic dissection of ttg1-dependent regulation cascades in a. alpina, we identified the putative a. alpina ttg <dig> gene by homology and synteny comparisons. the a. alpina ttg <dig> gene  has a putative coding sequence of  <dig> base pairs representing a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids. the aattg <dig> gene shows 90% sequence identity when compared to the a. thaliana atttg <dig> gene. the two flanking genes of aattg <dig> are homologs of those two flanking atttg1: at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> . this indicates that aattg <dig> and atttg <dig> are orthologs. a comparison of the amino acid sequence revealed differences in  <dig> amino acids and two additional amino acids .

we identified two mutants in ems mutagenized m <dig> populations of a. alpina showing a phenotype similar to ttg1: glabrous trichomes and yellow seeds. one mutant was recovered from the ems treated wild-type background a. alpina pajares   <cit> . the other mutant was found in a mutagenized a. alpina  background carrying the pep1- <dig> mutation  <cit> . in the a. alpina  background the ttg <dig> gene contained a mutation that would lead to a t to m exchange at position  <dig> of the ttg <dig> protein, which, however, does not affect the function of ttg <dig> as this background shows no effect on any assumed ttg1-dependent phenotype. when sequencing the aattg <dig> gene in the ttg <dig> mutant isolated from the paj wild-type background we found a mutation leading to a stop codon after  <dig> amino acids in the second wd <dig> domain and called this allele aattg1- <dig>  the putative ttg <dig> allele induced in the pep1- <dig> background carried a mutation leading to a stop codon after  <dig> amino acids . as a premature stop codon two amino acids c-terminal to this position leads to strong ttg <dig> phenotypes in a. thaliana <cit> , it is conceivable that also the a. alpina aattg1- <dig> allele shows the observed strong phenotypes . together these data indicate that the two mutants identified by the trichome and seed color phenotypes are two a. alpina aattg <dig> alleles. we tested this by crossing aattg1- <dig> and aattg1- <dig> plants. f <dig> plants were glabrous confirming the allelism . to test whether aattg <dig> protein can rescue the arabidopsis ttg <dig> mutant phenotype we expressed the arabis alpina coding sequence under the promoter of the arabidopsis ttg <dig> gene  <cit> . towards this end we used the wild type coding sequence from a. alpina pajares and pep1- <dig>  we recovered  <dig> and four lines, respectively, displaying partial rescue of the trichome phenotype .

 anthocyanidin production in a. alpina wild type and aattg <dig> mutants
brown colour of arabidopsis seeds is caused by oxidized proanthocyanidins  <cit> . screening for differences in seed pigmentation revealed a group of mutants with transparent testa - including ttg <dig> - that was impaired in flavonoid accumulation  <cit> . most of these genes were subsequently identified either as structural enzymes or regulators  of the proanthocyanidin pathway  <cit> .

compared to the corresponding backgrounds, the seed colour of both aattg <dig> mutants is yellowish, sharing the transparent testa phenotype with the mutants in a. thaliana . this finding points to a lack of proanthocyanidins. the majority of procyanidin is found in the insoluble fraction of flavonoid extracts and can be analyzed by acidic hydrolysis to cyanidin  <cit> . we hydrolyzed the insoluble substances upon extraction for visual inspection . a pink staining that is characteristic for cyanidin was obtained for the backgrounds but not for the aattg <dig> mutants. in subsequent hplc-ms analysis of extracted soluble, hydrolyzed flavonoids no cyanidin was detectable, proofing its absence in aattg <dig> mutants . in contrast, kaempferol, was detected in the mutants and backgrounds, serving as a control for the successful extraction of flavonoids. this indicates that aattg <dig> either regulates the activity of the aaldox  enzyme that catalyses the last step of cyanidin biosynthesis and/or earlier enzymes of the pathway.

the so called late genes of the anthocyanidin biosynthesis have been classified by their regulation through the ttg <dig> containing mbw complexes  <cit> . therefore, our result identifies kaempferol as an early and cyanidin as a late component of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis pathway in a. alpina.

the anthocyanidin biosynthesis pathway is part of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis pathway. red colour of a. thaliana hypocotyls and young leaves is the result of accumulating uv-protective anthocyanidins and their derivatives upon exposure to light or other stresses  <cit> .

in a. thaliana, ttg <dig> as a general regulator also promotes visible accumulation of purple anthocyanins in the seedlingsâ€™ hypocotyls  <cit> . our finding that aattg <dig> confers a transparent testa phenotype to a. alpina seeds suggests an absence of anthocyanins also in the hypocotyl. it is, however, possible that a redundant regulator exists for anthocyanin accumulation.

to address this, we grew seedlings of the aattg <dig> alleles and their respective backgrounds under constant light on plates supplemented with sucrose. we found that in the hypocotyls of aattg <dig> mutant seedlings no visible pink anthocyanin was accumulated in contrast to paj and pep1- <dig> . moreover, hplc-ms analysis for both aattg <dig> mutants showed that aattg <dig> is also essential for the accumulation of cyanidin in seedlings and its function is not taken over by any other gene .

seed coat differentiation in a. alpina wild type and aattg <dig> mutants
in a. thaliana, seed epidermal cells of the outer integument differentiate into highly specialized seed coat cells. these are characterized by the formation of a central column surrounded by a secondary cell wall  and the accumulation of polysaccharide mucilage between the plasma membrane and the primary cell wall that is released in the presence of water  <cit> . in a. thaliana, ttg <dig> mutants neither form a columella nor produce mucilage  <cit> . we compared columella formation in the two ttg <dig> mutants with the respective genetic backgrounds paj and pep1- <dig> by staining with calcofluor white , ruthenium red  and by scanning electron microscopy analysis . wild type and pep1- <dig> seeds have an irregular but smooth surface with domes representing the columella . in the two corresponding aattg <dig> mutants, the columella is completely missing indicating that epidermal differentiation of the seed coat is affected similar as observed in atttg <dig> mutants  <cit>  .

trichome patterning in a. alpina wild type and aattg <dig> mutants
in a. thaliana, trichomes are initiated on young leaves and become separated by division and expansion of the epidermal cells lying in between  <cit> . at the first glance, trichome initiation on a. alpina leaves is very similar to the situation in a. thaliana : at the base of young leaves, we found incipient trichomes. these comprise trichome stages preceding branch initiation . mature trichomes with several branches were found at the leaf tip and intermediate stages were observed in the mid region . adult leaves are covered densely with trichomes . however, we noted one striking difference: on mature leaves we found two classes of mature trichomes that differed in size and height . our visual impression was that the larger trichomes  are arranged in a regular pattern with the smaller trichomes  being scattered between them . to test this, we systematically measured the distances between the two classes of trichomes. we analyzed three regions of the third leaf: a region at the base, in the middle and the tip. in all three regions, on average the larger trichomes showed about twice the distance from each other as compared to the distances in between smaller trichomes and between smaller trichomes and the larger trichomes . the same pattern was also found on the second to the sixths leaves indicating that it is a general feature . these distance patterns suggested to us two superimposed trichome patterns. we therefore studied young leaf stages in more detail using the analysis tool tricheratops  <cit> . a meta leaf was generated, in which the position of three developmental trichome stages are shown at their relative positions on the leaf with respect to the basal-distal axis . as described in a. thaliana, we found a general gradient of trichome developmental stages with mature trichomes at the tip and young trichomes at the base of the leaf. in contrast to a. thaliana, we observed early developmental stages of trichome development between already mature trichomes . these patterns may either be explained by the formation of new trichomes between more mature trichomes or by spatial differences in the growth characteristics such that the smaller trichomes are initiated normally, but grow slower. during the course of our experiments we noted that all a. alpina leaves are densely covered with trichomes on both the adaxial and the abaxial sides . this is in contrast to a. thaliana where only late leaves produce abaxial trichomes as a consequence of the phase change from vegetative to generative growth  <cit> . to analyse the role of a. alpina ttg <dig> in trichome formation we analysed the two ttg <dig> mutants aattg1- <dig> and aattg1- <dig>  as known from strong ttg <dig> mutants in a. thaliana both alleles lacked trichomes completely .

root hair patterning in a. alpina wild type and aattg <dig> mutants
in a. thaliana, epidermal root cells are arranged in files. cells overlaying the cleft between two underlying cortex cells are short and differentiate into hair cells   <cit> . cells in all other files are long and do not develop root hairs . to understand root hair patterning in a. alpina, we analysed file-specific root hair production in two regions of the differentiation zone to determine the temporal spatial development of the root hair pattern . both, a. alpina paj and pep1- <dig> showed a similar frequency of root hair cells in the lower  and in the upper region  indicating that the final root hair pattern is determined already in the lower region . similar to a. thaliana almost all cells in the hâ€“position develop into root hairs. however, in a. alpina cells in n-file positions also frequently form root hairs . we found between 30%  and 40%  of the n-position cells to develop into root hairs . this finding raised the question, whether the cells in the hâ€“ and n-positions also differ in other characteristics. one difference reported in a. thaliana is the length of the individual cells such that cells in n-files are about twice as long as hâ€“file cells  <cit> . as the cell length continuously changes along the root axis due to cell growth, we did not measure the actual cell lengths, but rather determined the h- to n-file cell number ratios. in a. alpina paj we found a ratio of  <dig> , in pep1- <dig> the ratio was  <dig> , indicating that the n-file cells are approximately twice as long as h-file cells . during the course of experiments we noticed that the cells carrying a root hair in n position were not evenly distributed along the file, but were arranged in continuous stretches of n-file cells differentiating into root hairs. as depicted in figureÂ 5f, more than 50% of all stretches consisted of  <dig> to  <dig> cells, indicating a higher probability for short  than for long  stretches. typically, we found root hairs in n-position always on only one side of an h-file. out of  <dig> paj h-file cells, just one was flanked symmetrically by two n-file cells carrying a root hair . to study the function of a. alpina ttg <dig> in root hair patterning we studied root hair patterning in aattg1- <dig> and aattg1- <dig>  we found ectopic root hairs at n-positions similar as described in a. thaliana .

discussion
ttg <dig> containing mbw complexes regulate five different traits in a. thaliana including proanthocyanidin, anthocyanidin and mucilage production as well as trichome and root hair patterning. taking together the data on single or multiple ttg1-dependent traits studied in different brassicaceae species indicates that ttg <dig> has the same range of functions as described in a. thaliana throughout this family. for brassica rapa a function in trichome and seed color was reported  <cit> . in matthiola incana a role in -anthocyanin, mucilage and trichome formation was shown  <cit> . in support of these findings, we show that these four traits and in addition root hair patterning are affected in two independent aattg <dig> alleles in a. alpina.

these five traits have an adaptive value for the plant. therefore, on the one hand, variability between species might be expected. on the other hand, these traits are regulated by differential ttg <dig> complexes encoded by members of the ttg <dig> gene regulatory network. due to this genetic interdependence variability might be limited. in support of these considerations we found no apparent differences between a. alpina and a. thaliana for some but not all traits.

according to serna and martin, the ttg1-dependent regulation of  anthocyanidin production is a more ancient trait than trichome formation  <cit> . in agreement with this, the ttg1-dependent definition of early and late substances between kaempferol and cyanidin is maintained in a. alpina as compared to a. thaliana <cit> . similarly, aattg <dig> is needed for columella formation as described for a. thaliana <cit> .

while the phenotypes of these traits are generally very similar to those in a. thaliana, we noted some striking deviations for trichome and root hair patterning that are not trivial to explain in the light of the known regulation schemes. the observed two superimposed trichome patterns can be explained in two ways. one possibility is that small and large trichomes are initiated around the same time and that the subsequent cell differentiation differs. in this scenario, genes regulating cell differentiation and/or morphogenesis would be differentially expressed in the two types of trichomes. this could occur at different levels including genes regulating differentiation such as myb <dig> and myb <dig>  <cit> , gl <dig>  <cit> , ttg <dig>  <cit>  or genes controlling endoreduplication such as for example the group of kak genes  <cit> . the second possibility is that trichome initiation occurs in developmentally advanced stages of leaf development. in a. thaliana this phenotype was found in lines overexpressing the gl3/egl <dig> homolog from maize, the r-gene  <cit> . by analogy, the intercalation phenotype in a. alpina could be explained by changes in the spatial/temporal expression of a. alpina gl <dig>  the formation of root hairs in n-files is also not found in wild type a. thaliana under normal conditions but is reminiscent of atttg <dig> and atwer mutants  <cit> . thus, one possibility to derive the wild-type pattern in a. alpina roots is a reduction of the aattg <dig> or aawer activity. given that mutations reducing trichome number lead to the production of additional root hairs because the mbw complex serves to activate trichomes and non-root hair fates the production of additional root hairs and extra trichome formation between mature trichomes cannot easily be explained by the a. thaliana network.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results demonstrate that the phenotypes of the five ttg1-dependent traits studied here are in general very similar in a. thaliana and a. alpina. the various phenotypic differences make a. alpina a very interesting genetic model system to study the evolution of gene regulatory networks at a functional level.
