BACKGROUND
in several neurologic diseases, a pleocytosis is often detected in the cerebrospinal fluid . lymphocytes and plasma cells have been shown to prevail in the cell count in viral infections  <cit> , chronic steroid responsive meningitis-arteritis   <cit> , granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis  and in necrotizing encephalitides   <cit> . a neutrophilic pleocytosis is characteristic for bacterial infections and the acute stage of srma  <cit> . a mixed cell population can be seen in protozoal diseases, chronic bacterial infections, necrotic lesions, and in gme  <cit> . in addition to inflammatory lesions, mild mixed cell pleocytosis can also be seen with acute intervertebral disc disease resulting in central nervous system  myelomalacia or infarction  <cit> . chemokines are important factors in the mechanism of cell migration and thus play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of inflammation within the cns  <cit> . they up-regulate surface molecules on circulating inflammatory cells in the periphery which enable them to more efficiently adhere to the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier  and react to the cns chemokine gradients  <cit> . one aim of therapeutic research is to develop specific treatments to modulate the inflammatory response within the cns  <cit>  in diseases such as srma and meningoencephalitides of unknown origin , and also modulate inflammation in intervertebral disc diseases which may be responsible for secondary wave injury  <cit> . one chemokine that could be involved in the pathogenesis of an inflammatory reaction and is a compelling candidate for future modulation is  ligand  <dig> , also known as mip-3β . this protein will be referred to as ccl <dig> for most of the text of this manuscript but, these terms may be used interchangeably. ccl <dig> is constitutively expressed in the cns for fast immunosurveillance  <cit>  and is produced by different cells such as dendritic cells , macrophages and some non-hematopoietic cells  <cit> . it binds to the ccr <dig> receptor which is expressed on myeloid cells  <cit> , mature dc, t cells, as well as activated b cells  <cit> . ccl <dig> was suggested to be involved in the development of chronic inflammation and lymphoid neogenesis, guiding b cells and t cells into the target organ, such as the brain  <cit> . it is also expressed de novo in various neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis  <cit>  or chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis   <cit> . bone marrow derived microglia or macrophages connect the brain with the immune system  <cit> . guiding these cells to the cns may also be regulated by ccl <dig>  due to its role in attracting macrophage progenitors  <cit> . microglia may produce ccl <dig> and were shown to be activated in canine diseases such as muo  <cit>  and spinal cord injury  <cit> . in the current study, our hypothesis is that protein ccl <dig> is, at least in part, involved in the pathogenesis of cns diseases and may be involved in the invasion of mononuclear cells into the subarachnoid space of dogs. therefore, three diseases were chosen: steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis , meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin , and intervertebral disc disease . in srma, a th2-mediated immune response was shown  <cit>  and a th <dig> skewed immune response may be accountable for maintaining the inflammatory reaction  <cit> . for comparison, muo was chosen as a disease group with a predominantly mononuclear pleocytosis within the csf  <cit>  despite the heterogeneity of the group. examples of idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the cns are ne and gme, in which a strong genetic component  <cit> , occurrence of autoantibodies  <cit> , and the distribution of lymphocytes and macrophages  <cit> , suggest a strong involvement of mononuclear cells in the pathogenesis. a third group was analyzed. in spinal cord injury involving intervertebral disc herniation, a local inflammatory reaction has been documented  <cit>  and the macrophage count within the csf is thought to be positively associated with the degree of spinal cord damage  <cit> . with this investigation, we seek to understand the role of ccl <dig> in the aforementioned cns diseases in dogs and establish whether this chemokine is generally associated with cns inflammation or specific to certain diseases.

methods
samples from patients and controls
a total of  <dig> patients were analyzed following referral to the department of small animal medicine and surgery, university of veterinary medicine hannover, germany and the veterinary emergency and specialty center  santa fe, nm, usa . the study was approved by the ethics committee of the university for veterinary medicine hannover. the experimental protocols and procedures in healthy dogs were performed in accordance with the european communities council directive of  <dig> november  <dig>  and were approved by the authorities in lower saxony . csf and serum samples for ccl <dig> assays were obtained and stored at -20°c. blood was collected via cephalic, saphenous or jugular venipuncture into serum tubes. csf collection was performed under general anesthesia by cisternal puncture for srma, muo, ie and healthy dogs or lumbar puncture for ivdd dogs. the csf was centrifuged and the sediment was removed. the remaining csf was stored at -20°c within 2 hours of sample collection. number of patients and their laboratory findings are provided in table  <dig>

data are provided as medians .

srma group: fifty one patients were diagnosed with srma based on clinical signs, complete blood and csf examinations, normal cervical radiographs, elevated iga levels in csf and serum, response to glucocorticosteroid treatment. the untreated srma group consisted of  <dig> patients which received no medication at the time of sample collection. nine of these dogs were evaluated separately, five patients having received a one-time pre-treatment with corticosteroids by the referring veterinarian and four patients having relapsed after stopping previous therapy. csf and blood findings are summarized in table  <dig>  the srma treatment group consisted of  <dig> of the  <dig> patients having received more than one steroid treatment prior to csf acquisition.

muo group: csf was also obtained from  <dig> patients with presumed muo. sixteen of these patients received no therapy , while  <dig> patients were already being treated with prednisolone  . the suspected diagnosis was supported by clinical signs, csf analysis  and magnetic resonance imaging  findings employing t1w, with and without contrast medium, t2w, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery  sequences. in ten patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination and included four cases of gme, two of ne and four cases with muo with a histopathological pattern not related to gme or ne.

ivdd group: the csf of  <dig> patients with ivdd was analyzed. the diagnosis of ivdd was made by clinical signs, csf analysis, mri and surgery findings. based on the severity of clinical signs, the patients were grouped into five grades  <cit> . twenty five patients were combined with the neurologic status grade 2/ <dig> to one group. the dogs were mild to severely paretic, but capable of spontaneous movement. a second group contained  <dig> patients with the neurologic status grade 4/ <dig>  which were paralyzed with or without deep pain sensation .

control group: csf samples with normal reference values   <cit>  were analyzed. twenty one patients were diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy based on clinical signs, blood work, mri and csf results . ie, a non-inflammatory cns disease with normal csf cell count, was compared to srma, muo and ivdd.

healthy dogs: additionally, six samples were obtained from healthy dogs   and compared to dogs affected with ie to evaluate differences of csf ccl <dig> concentrations between dogs with normal csf cell counts.

measurement of ccl19
concentrations of ccl <dig> in the csf and serum were determined by sandwich elisa . an elisa kit specific for canine ccl <dig>  was used according to manufacturer’s instructions . briefly, the microtiter plate provided in the elisa kit has been pre-coated with a monoclonal antibody specific to ccl <dig>  csf samples were used undiluted or were diluted to a dilution of 1: <dig> with the standard diluent depending on the ccl <dig> output concentration. serum samples were used undiluted for the elisa. seven wells were prepared for the dilutions of standard, one well was left blank and the rest of the  <dig> wells were used for the csf and serum samples. four csf and serum samples of the ie group served as a control and one of these ie samples was pipetted to the plates in each experiment. samples as a positive control were csf and serum samples of the neuroinflammatory group and the same sample was used in each experiment at same dilution. the color change was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm ± 10 nm on a microplate reader equipped with the analysis software gen  <dig> . the detection range of this method was  <dig>  - 1000 pg/ml. the standard curve was created using a lyophilized standard reagent  provided in the elisa kit. standard concentrations used for the elisa were 1000 pg/ml, 500 pg/ml, 250 pg/ml, 125 pg/ml,  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  pg/ml,  <dig>  pg/ml. the minimum detectable dose of canine ccl <dig> is  <dig>  pg/ml. all measurements of the csf and serum were performed in duplicates.

chemotaxis assay
to evaluate chemotactic activity of measured csf samples for mononuclear cell migration, assays were performed using a disposable 96-well chemotaxis chamber with polycarbonate filters  . csf samples of seven patients were examined, three untreated patients diagnosed with srma, two untreated patients with the suspected diagnosis of muo and two patients with ivdd. peripheral mononuclear cells  were separated from five milliliters of fresh edta blood collected via cephalic venipuncture of a healthy dog. pmcs were separated by ficoll gradient centrifugation according to the technique described by toth et al.  <dig>  <cit> . pmcs were washed twice with ten milliliters hank’s balanced salt solution   and re-suspended in cell-wash fluid . the cell suspension was stained by trypanblue  fa. sigma-aldrich, schnelldorf, germany) and counted in a turk cell counting chamber . twenty five microliters of the cell suspension  were pipetted directly on the top side of the filter, which is coated with a hydrophobic mask around each of the test sites. the hydrophobic mask restricts the cell suspension to these sites, eliminating the need for upper wells. a known serial dilution of the cell suspension with  <dig> cells,  <dig> cells,  <dig> cells,  <dig> cells,  <dig> cells,  <dig> cells and  <dig> cells diluted in medium was pipetted in one row of wells to serve as a standard with which to compare the readings from the experimental wells. the rest of the  <dig> wells were loaded in duplicates with 29 μl of srma , ivdd  and muo  csf samples diluted in equal volume in rosewell park memorial institute  <dig> medium with l-glutamine  containing 1% bovine serum albumin  and a negative control of pure medium. the loaded chamber with added cell suspension on the top side of the filter was cultured at 37°c in humidified air with 5% co <dig> in an incubator  while the migration time for the cell suspension was measured at 30 minutes, 1 hour,  <dig>  hours and 2 hours. the filter was removed and cells that had migrated through the filter to the lower wells were counted by alamarblue® assay . alamarblue® reagent was added as 10% of the sample volume, followed by  <dig> to 3 hours incubation at 37°c. resazurin, the active ingredient of alamarblue® reagent, is a non-toxic, cell permeable compound that is blue in color and virtually non-fluorescent. upon entering cells, resazurin is reduced by viable cells to resorufin, a compound that is red in color and highly fluorescent. the resulting fluorescence was read on a microplate reader equipped with the analysis software gen  <dig> .

statistics
for group comparison, the kruskal-wallis test and the mann–whitney–wilcoxon tests were used. using the shapiro-wilk test, an abnormal data distribution was found. correlation between two variables were tested by spearman and kendall rank correlation tests. statistical significance was set at the 5% level .

RESULTS
ccl <dig> concentration in csf of the control group  and healthy dogs
ccl <dig> was measurable in all  <dig> samples of patients with idiopathic epilepsy and in the  <dig> samples from healthy donors . the comparison between ie and healthy animals showed significant difference  which is shown in figure  <dig>  although there were significant differences detected between samples from dogs with ie and from healthy animals, ie is considered as the control group due to normal csf examinations and normal csf cell count. the median csf ccl <dig> content of the control group ie was 66 pg/ml. healthy dogs had a median csf ccl <dig> concentration of  <dig>  pg/ml . the significant difference between ie and healthy dogs suggests that ccl <dig> might be involved in the pathway of ie. since only a small number of neurologically normal dogs was available for evaluation, further studies with a larger cohort of dogs focusing on ie in comparison to healthy dogs are indicated.

ccl <dig> csf concentration in inflammatory diseases
significantly elevated ccl <dig> concentrations were observed in csf samples of untreated srma and muo patients compared to the control group   as shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig>  and table  <dig>  dogs that had undergone therapy had significantly lower ccl <dig> values compared to the patients without therapy . treated srma dogs  and treated muo patients  did not differ significantly from the controls. srma patients, which received one injection of glucocorticosteroids before initial examination, had significantly lower ccl <dig> levels  compared to entirely untreated animals. the subgroup of patients having a relapse did not differ statistically  from untreated patients .

further evaluation of inflammatory diseases
the csf ccl <dig> concentrations of both untreated srma and untreated muo patients were significantly correlated with the csf cell count .

srma and muo patients under glucocorticosteroid treatment displayed no correlation between csf cell count and ccl <dig> concentration as indicated by the results of spearman and kendall’s rank test . the csf ccl <dig> and serum ccl <dig> concentrations did not correlate with each other indicating that csf elevation is not due, at least entirely, to bbb disruption . total protein levels within the csf from untreated srma dogs had a weak correlation with csf ccl <dig> concentrations using spearman rank test ; the kendall rank test was performed due to the occurrence of outliers and revealed a significant correlation . dogs with muo that did not receive therapy had no strong correlation between ccl <dig> csf and csf protein concentration .

ccl <dig> csf concentration in intervertebral disc disease
csf ccl <dig> concentrations of ivdd are significantly elevated compared to the control group  as illustrated in the box-and-whisker plots in figure  <dig>  the median concentration of the protein in the ivdd grade 2/ <dig> group was  <dig>  pg/ml while grades 4/ <dig> had a higher median of  <dig>  pg/ml, as compared to the controls with a median concentration of 66 pg/ml . the concentrations between the two ivdd groups did not differ significantly . in comparison to the median ccl <dig> concentrations from untreated inflammatory neurologic diseases  the elevations were mild .

further evaluation of ivdd
no significant correlation of csf ccl <dig> concentrations to csf cell count was found among the ivdd group . ccl <dig> csf concentration and ccl <dig> serum concentration were significantly correlated within ivdd group 2/ <dig>  while ivdd group 4/ <dig> had no significant correlation .

chemotactic activity of selected csf samples for mononuclear cells
csf samples were used to induce mononuclear cell chemotactic activity. csf of neuroinflammatory diseases, including srma and muo, showed high cell migration as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the srma samples with a mean concentration of  <dig>  pg/ml ccl <dig> attracted  <dig> cells and the muo samples with a mean concentration of 1831 pg/ml ccl <dig> attracted  <dig> cells after a two hour period, which was significantly more than the control group . the csf samples of dogs with ivdd with a much lower mean ccl <dig> concentration of  <dig>  pg/ml compared to neuroinflammatory diseases also had a significant impact on migration and on average  <dig> cells moved to the lower chamber after a 2 hour incubation time .

discussion
the results of this study support the hypothesis that the protein ccl <dig> is elevated in selected cns diseases and might be involved in the pathogenesis of mononuclear cells migration into the subarachnoid space of dogs with inflammatory cns diseases and non-inflammatory cns diseases such as intervertebral disc disease . csf levels of the chemokine ccl <dig> were analyzed in dogs afflicted with srma, an inflammatory cns disease, and compared to other neuroinflammatory diseases , traumatic ivdd, a non-inflammatory cns disease, idiopathic epilepsy  and normal unafflicted animals.

ccl <dig> was detectable in healthy dogs and in patients with idiopathic epilepsy, a non-inflammatory neurologic disease, which is in agreement with the results of other studies  <cit>  in that ccl <dig> is constitutively expressed in the cns and linked to the physiological immunosurveillance  <cit> . however, ccl <dig> was markedly increased in both neuro- inflammatory diseases srma and muo . thus, ccl <dig> might be involved in the pathogenesis of cns inflammation and in the migration of inflammatory cells into the subarachnoid space. krumbholz et al. <cit>  and pashenkov et al.  <cit>  observed a csf ccl <dig> elevation in neuro- inflammatory diseases of human patients. earlier observations have shown that ccl <dig> is also produced by neutrophils  <cit> . the higher concentration of the chemokine in srma is consistent with the fact that srma csf has an increased neutrophilic inflammatory response. the elevated chemokine concentration may maintain the inflammatory response and later transfer to an autoimmune reaction attracting certain lymphocyte subsets. additionally, a disrupted blood brain barrier is consistent with a strong inflammatory response and could support the explanation for much higher ccl <dig> data. however, ccl <dig> levels were higher in csf samples compared to serum concentrations in neuroinflammatory diseases suggesting intrathecal production rather than passive diffusion through a disrupted blood brain barrier. results of pelletier et al.’s study revealed that a novel chemokine-dependent reciprocal cross-talk between neutrophils and th <dig> cells exists  <cit> . activated neutrophils induced chemotaxis of th <dig> cells and in turn could attract more neutrophils  <cit> . observations from maiolini hint that the immunopathology of srma is maintained by a th <dig> response  <cit> . neutrophils can release a number of chemokines including ccl <dig>  which can specifically induce chemotaxis of dendritic cells  and trigger rapid integrin-dependent adhesion of ccr7-expressing lymphocytes  <cit> . the neutrophil’s capability of ccl <dig> production might be important in guiding these cells to the inflamed sites and contributing to the regulation of the immune response. it has been shown previously that ccr <dig> ligands like ccl <dig> have a function in stimulating dcs for il- <dig> production and generation of pathogenic th <dig> cells in eae induction  <cit> . an uncontrolled interleukin  il-23–il- <dig> pathway could maintain a chronic inflammatory response and lead to persistent immunopathology  <cit> . investigating this relationship and uncovering other similar pathways could be vital to our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. the intrathecally produced ccl <dig> might not only play a role in inducing autoimmune diseases but also in maintaining chronic forms through recruitment of antigen presenting cells and lymphocytes, resulting in perpetual antigenic stimulation  <cit> . guinti et al. also observed significant levels of ccl <dig> in patients affected with ms and patients affected with other neuroinflammatory diseases and suspect involvement in t-cell trafficking  <cit> . in our study, the strong correlation between intrathecal ccl <dig> and the csf cell count suggest ccl <dig> may play an important role in recruiting immune cells to the cns.

srma and muo patients receiving glucocorticosteroids had significantly less ccl <dig> concentrations, showing that steroids have a strong impact in reducing the inflammatory pathway. krumbholz et al.’s study did not reveal that ms patients receiving treatment differ from untreated patients  <cit> . glucocorticosteroids are shown to reduce the invasion of neutrophils  <cit>  and may alter the production of chemokines in dogs. relapsing srma also displayed elevated chemokine concentrations. this finding suggests the potential utility of this protein for developing new treatment schemes in inflammatory diseases, and to indicate the success of treatment.

the elevation of ccl <dig> in ivdd csf suggests a process of a secondary inflammatory response within the cns  <cit> . gray and white matter are affected by trauma, especially when white matter damage is observed  <cit>  through apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation. increased inflammatory cytokines in patients with chronic spinal cord injury after trauma suggest an altered immunological activation. a study by srugo et al. suggested csf pleocytosis is positively associated with the severity of thoracolumbar spinal cord damage in dogs with ivdd. they found that the percentage of csf macrophages can be used as a prognostic indicator for regaining ambulation in dogs that have lost deep pain sensation  <cit> . the current study addresses the question if ccl <dig> could also play an important role for the migration of cells and the inflammatory pathogenesis in ivdd. a modest correlation of csf to serum ccl <dig> in ivdd group 2/ <dig> suggest that csf ccl <dig> is derived by leakage via extracellular pathways from the circulation and not solely from intrathecal production in this group of patients. however, no correlation was found in between csf and serum ccl <dig> concentrations in ivdd group 4/ <dig> and some samples showed much higher csf values suggesting the likelyhood of intrathecal production. a set of chemokines is intrathecally produced in cns diseases leading to an inflammatory response. the fact that ccl <dig> is significantly elevated but, did not correlate with csf cell count in either ivdd group suggests that ccl <dig> is not solely responsible for the recruitment of cells but, may play a part in the pathogenesis of ivdd inflammation.

the performed chemotaxis assay from csf samples attracted mononuclear cells. csf of neuro-inflammatory diseases showed strong chemotactic activity in comparison to the controls. even csf samples of dogs with ivdd with a much lower mean ccl <dig> concentration showed a pronounced impact on cell migration, which suggests the presents of a functional chemotactic protein. alt et al. showed that the expression of ccl <dig> occurs at the bbb in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and concluded that this chemokine may contribute to t -cell attraction across the bbb  <cit> . csf consists of various sets of chemokines responsible for cell migration. a chemotaxis study using a ccl <dig> antagonist may prove to be useful in defining ccl19’s role in mononuclear cell migration into the cns of srma, muo and ivdd dogs. a study from pineau and lacroix on rodent models revealed that cytokine production is time dependent  <cit> . cns resident cells, including neurons, synthesized cytokines between  <dig> and 24 hours post sci and some infiltrating leukocytes were responsible for the cytokine production 12 hours after the trauma. this would suggest that neural cells are responsible for the initial inflammatory response following sci but, the recruitment of additional immune cells is responsible for the maintenance of inflammation  <cit> . additional studies would be necessary to determine the time at which ccl <dig> becomes a major inflammatory mediator. kwon et al. observed in his study that interleukin - <dig>  il- <dig>  tau, s100b and glial fibrillary acidic protein were elevated depending on severity of the initial injury. evaluating this group of inflammatory cytokines, a biochemical model was developed enabling veterinary scientists to predict the asia  grade in 89% of their subjects. it was found that the pattern of protein expression within the csf over the first few days following injury were strong indicators of neurologic outcome and thus, are now a focus of therapeutic research for sci  <cit> . using ccl <dig> csf concentration as a prognostic marker could be also helpful in the research of sci in dogs, which should be followed up in further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, ccl <dig> csf concentrations were markedly elevated in patients with neuroinflammatory disease and may play an important role in their pathogenesis with recruitment of inflammatory cells into the subarachnoid space of dogs. this study also showed an elevated csf ccl <dig> concentration in dogs with ivdd, indicating that the chemokine might also be associated with the secondary wave of sci, following an acute cord insult. a marked chemotactic activity for mononuclear cells was observed in selected csf samples of the neuroinflammatory and non-neuroinflammatory disease. further functional studies could confirm that ccl <dig> has a major role of mononuclear cell migration into the subarachnoid space of dogs affected with srma, muo, ivdd and may be a precious target for developing new treatment schemes.
