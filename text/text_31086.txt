BACKGROUND
brucella spp. are gram-negative, non-motile, facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens that are the etiologic agents of brucellosis, causing abortion and sterility in a broad range of domestic and wild animals. furthermore, brucellosis is a chronic zoonotic disease characterized in humans by undulant fever, arthritic pain and neurological disorders. brucella virulence relies upon the ability to enter phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, control the host's intracellular trafficking to avoid lysosomal degradation, and replicate in a brucella-containing vacuole  without restricting host cell functions or inducing programmed death  <cit> . although a few genes are directly attributed to the survival and intracellular trafficking of brucella in the host cell  glucan, lipopolysaccharide and the type iv secretion system ), many aspects of the intracellular lifestyle remain unresolved  <cit> .

quorum sensing , a communication system of bacteria, has been shown to coordinate group behavior in a density dependent manner by regulating gene expression; including secretion systems, biofilm formation, ai production, and cell division  <cit> . qs typically follows production of a diffusible signaling molecule or autoinducer  acyl-homoserine lactone . among proteobacteria, the larger family to which brucella belong, the ahl signal is synthesized by luxi, and shown to interact with the transcriptional regulator luxr to cooperatively modulate gene expression  <cit> . in addition to an ahl signal, luxr regulatory activity can be modulated by phosphorylation , contain multiple ligand binding sites , or luxr can function as an autonomous effector without a regulatory domain   <cit> .

two luxr-like transcriptional regulators, vjbr and blxr  have been identified in brucella melitensis  <cit> . vjbr was shown to positively influence expression of the t4ss and flagellar genes, both of which contribute to b. melitensis virulence and survival  <cit> . although an ahl signal n-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  has been purified from brucella culture supernatants, the gene responsible for the production of this ahl  has not yet been identified  <cit> . one possible explanation for the apparent absence of luxi homologues is that brucella contains a novel ahl synthetase that remains to be identified. the fact that both luxr homologues respond to c12-hsl by altering the expression of virulence determinants is also consistent with a role for the autoinducer in regulating expression of genes necessary for intracellular survival  <cit> . specifically, expression of the virb and flge operons are repressed by the addition of exogenous c12-hsl  <cit> . the results reported here extend those observations and suggest that c12-hsl acts as a global repressor of gene expression via interaction with vjbr while functioning to activate expression of other loci independent of vjbr.

in the present study, we sought to identify additional regulatory targets of the putative qs components vjbr and c12-hsl in an effort to identify novel virulence factors to confirm a role for qs in intracellular survival. custom b. melitensis 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays were utilized to characterize gene expression. comparison of transcript levels from b. melitensis wildtype and a vjbr deletion mutant, with and without the addition of exogenous c12-hsl revealed a large number of genes not previously shown to be regulated in b. melitensis, including those involved in numerous metabolic pathways and putative virulence genes . additionally, results confirmed earlier findings of genes regulated by these components, validating the microarray approach for identification of genes that may contribute to intracellular survival and virulence.

RESULTS
identification and screening for attenuation of Δluxr mutants in j774a. <dig> macrophage-like cells
a luxr-like gene, vjbr, was identified in a mutagenesis screen conducted by this laboratory and others  <cit> . more recently, a second luxr-like gene, blxr , has also been identified and characterized  <cit> . these two homologues, vjbr and blxr, contain the two domains associated with qs luxr proteins . blast protein homology searches with the luxr-like proteins identified three additional proteins that contain significant similarity to the luxr helix-turn-helix  dna binding domain but do not contain the ahl binding domain. all  <dig> b. melitensis luxr-like proteins exhibit similar levels of relatedness to agrobacterium tumefaciens trar homolog  and canonical luxr homolog lasr from pseudomonas aeruginosa . despite the absence of a characterized activation domain, evaluation of these three proteins was pursued due to their similarity with luxr homologs best characterized in vibrio harveyi that act autonomously or via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation to alter gene expression from selected loci  <cit> .

gene replacement and deletion mutations were created for all five homologues including the three newly discovered hth luxr dna binding domain homologues , vjbr, and blxr in b. melitensis 16m and survival in j774a. <dig> macrophage-like cells was subsequently assessed by gentamycin protection assays. confirming previous findings, intracellular survival was significantly reduced for both the vjbr transposon and deletion mutants and not for the blxr mutant, as indicated by cfu recovery after  <dig> hrs of infection   <cit> . survival of the vjbr mutant was restored to nearly wildtype levels after complementation . no significant difference in cfu was observed for the other three mutants when compared to wildtype infected cells, indicating that these homologues are either not required for intracellular replication in macrophages or there is functional redundancy among some of homologues . a recent report presented evidence indicating that the Δblxr and Δvjbr mutants exhibited similar levels of attenuated intracellular survival in the raw <dig>  macrophage cells  <cit> . however, the Δblxr mutant proved to be virulent in irf1-/- knockout mice, with only a slight delay in mortality when compared to wildtype   <cit> . for comparison, all of the mice inoculated with the Δvjbr mutant survived to at least day  <dig>  <cit> . taken together the results suggest that the loss of blxr expression has only a modest effect on virulence/survival and the attenuated phenotype of the Δvjbr mutant is more consistently observed.

microarray analysis indicates that brucella putative quorum sensing components are global regulators of gene expression
to investigate the transcriptional effects resulting from a vjbr deletion and the addition of exogenous c12-hsl, rna was isolated from wildtype b. melitensis 16m, the isogenic Δvjbr, and both strains with the addition of exogenous c12-hsl, at a logarithmic growth phase and an early stationary growth phase. the use of exogenous c12-hsl addition to cultures was selected because of the inability to eliminate the gene responsible for c12-hsl production. three independent rna samples were harvested at each time point  and hybridized with reference genomic dna, which yielded a total of  <dig> microarrays.

microarray analysis revealed a total of  <dig>  and  <dig> genes  to be differentially expressed between wildtype and Δvjbr cultures at exponential and stationary growth phases, respectively . this comprises 14% of the b. melitensis genome and is comparable to the value of 10% for luxr-regulated genes previously predicted for in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the majority of altered genes at the exponential phase were down-regulated  in the absence of vjbr, while only  <dig> genes were up-regulated . there were also a large number of down-regulated genes  at the stationary phase; however, at this later time point there were also  <dig> genes that were specifically up-regulated . when comparing wild-type cells with and without the addition of exogenous c12-hsl, the majority of genes were found to be down-regulated at both growth phases,  <dig> genes at exponential phase  and  <dig> genes at stationary phase . these data suggest that vjbr is primarily a promoter of gene expression at the exponential growth phase and acts as both a transcriptional repressor and activator at the stationary growth phase. conversely, c12-hsl primarily represses gene expression at both growth phases.

quantitative real time pcr  was performed to verify the changes in gene expression for  <dig> randomly selected genes found to be altered by the microarray analyses . for consistency across the different transcriptional profiling assays, cdna was synthesized from the same rna extracts harvested for the microarray experiments. for the  <dig> selected genes, the relative transcript levels were comparable to the expression levels obtained from the microarray data.

a  indicates genes excluded for technical reasons or had a fold change of less than  <dig> . qrt-pcr values were calculated by the ΔΔct method normalized to 16s rrna and are relative to the wildtype, averaged from  <dig> independently isolated samples, performed in triplicate in a minimum of three assays. es, exponential growth phase; sp, stationary growth phase.

recently, a virb promoter sequence was identified and confirmed to promote expression of downstream genes via vjbr  <cit> . with such a large number of transcriptional regulators found to be altered downstream of vjbr and by the addition of c12-hsl , it is plausible that many of the gene alterations observed may be downstream events and not directly regulated by vjbr. to identify altered genes that are likely directly regulated by vjbr, microarray data from these studies were compared to the potential operons downstream of the predicted vjbr promoter sequences  <cit> . a total of  <dig> potential operons from the  <dig> previously predicted vjbr promoter sequences were found to be altered by a deletion of vjbr and/or treatment of wildtype cells with c12-hsl, comprised of  <dig> genes   <cit> . a total of  <dig> promoters from the confirmed  <dig> found to be activated by vjbr in an e. coli model were identified in the microarray analyses conducted in this study, confirming the direct regulation of these particular operons   <cit> .

a  indicates genes excluded for technical reasons or had a fold change of less than  <dig> ; † genes that did not pass the statistical significance test but showed an average alteration of at least  <dig> -fold. fold change values are the averaged log <dig> ratio of normalized signal values from two independent statistical analyses. abbreviations as follows: stm, signature tagged mutagenesis.

the differentially expressed genes were categorized by clusters of orthologous genes , obtained from the doe joint genome institute integrated microbial genomics project http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi. this classification revealed categories that were equally altered by both the vjbr mutant and addition of c12-hsl to wildtype bacteria . for example; defense mechanisms, intracellular trafficking and secretion were highly over-represented when compared to genomic content. of particular note, genes involved in cell division were found to be over-represented in wildtype bacteria grown in the presence of c12-hsl but not by deletion of vjbr, indicating that c12-hsl regulates cellular division and may play a key role in the intracellular replication of the bacteria.

genes found to be altered by deletion of vjbr and treatment with c12-hsl in both wildtype and Δvjbr backgrounds were compared to data compiled from random mutagenesis screenings, resulting in the identification of  <dig> genes   <cit> . this correlation strongly suggests that vjbr and c12-hsl are involved not only in regulating the expression of a diverse array of genes but numerous genetic loci that individually make significant contributions to the intracellular survival of brucella spp.

vjbr and c12-hsl modulate gene transcription in a temporal manner
comparison of altered gene transcripts resulting from the Δvjbr mutation revealed that 13%  were found to be regulated at both growth phases, suggesting that vjbr exerts temporal control over gene regulation . a similar subset of genes were also identified in wildtype bacteria that were treated with c12-hsl when compared to those without treatment, with 12%  of transcripts altered at both growth stages. the low correlation of genes altered at both growth stages suggests that both vjbr and c12-hsl regulate distinct regulons at the two growth stages examined.

a recent study compared microarray and proteomic data from a Δvjbr mutant at a late exponential growth phase , corresponding to a total of  <dig> genes and the virb operon found at the growth phases examined here  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes in common with the study by uzureau et al.;  <dig> genes and the virb operon identified in our study  correlated in the magnitude of change with both the protein and microarray data, bmei <dig> correlated with the protein data, and  <dig> genes  correlated with the microarray data   <cit> . additionally,  <dig> genes did not correspond with the magnitude of alteration in the microarray analyses conducted in this study   <cit> . the low similarity of regulated genes from these two studies that examined a total of  <dig> different growth phases provides further support of the vjbr temporal gene regulation observed here  <cit> .

a similar pattern of temporal gene regulation by ahl quorum sensing signals has also been observed in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . distinct regulons were identified at an exponential and early stationary growth phase by utilization of a mutated strain that does not produce ahl signals, leading to the conclusion that the temporal regulation is independent of ahl concentration  <cit> . examination of two luxr gene transcript levels in p. aeruginosa revealed an increase from the late logarithmic to early stationary phase, coinciding with the induction of most quorum-activated genes and supporting a hypothesis that the receptor levels govern the onset of induction  <cit> . likewise, the relative expression of b. melitensis vjbr was found to increase 25-fold from exponential to stationary growth phase by qrt-pcr . the observed increase in the transcript levels of vjbr supports a similar hypothesis for the temporal gene regulation observed by vjbr in b. melitensis

vjbr and c12-hsl alter expression of a common set of genes
to examine the relationship between vjbr and c12-hsl gene regulation, the significantly altered genes from the vjbr regulon were compared to the significantly altered genes from the c12-hsl regulon . in all,  <dig> genes were found to be co-regulated during the exponential growth phase and  <dig> genes at the stationary growth phase, representing approximately 20% of the total number of altered genes identified by microarray analysis. the majority of the common, differently expressed transcripts  were found to be altered in the same direction by both the vjbr mutant and in response to c12-hsl administration, implying that vjbr and c12-hsl exert inverse effects on gene expression.

in addition to the t4ss and flagella operons being inversely co-regulated, t4ss-dependent effector proteins vcea and vcec were also found to be inversely regulated by the vjbr deletion mutant and addition of c12-hsl to wildtype cells, as well as exopolysaccharide production, proteases, peptidases and a universal stress protein . flagellar and exopolysaccharide synthesis genes have been implicated in the intracellular survival of brucella in mice and macrophages  <cit> . the down-regulation of these factors in vjbr mutants and in response to c12-hsl suggests that vjbr promotes brucella virulence; while conversely, c12-hsl represses such gene expression, either through the same regulatory pathway or independently.

these results expand on earlier findings that c12-hsl represses transcription of the t4ss through interactions with the response domain of vjbr  <cit> . the genes identified as co-regulated between vjbr and c12-hsl may be the result of c12-hsl reducing vjbr transcriptional activity through the ahl binding domain. additionally, the observation that the expression of vjbr itself was down-regulated at the stationary growth phase in response to c12-hsl administration further supports a non-cooperative relationship between vjbr and c12-hsl, .

physiological characterization of vjbr and c12-hsl transcriptomes
virulence. microarray results confirmed alteration of the previously identified t4ss and flagellar genes, both virulence-associated operons found to be regulated by vjbr and/or c12-hsl, as well as genes with homology to the recently identified t4ss effector proteins in b. abortus and b. suis  <cit> . furthermore, many putative virulence factors not previously correlated with vjbr or c12-hsl regulation in brucella spp. were identified; including protein secretion factors, adhesins, lipoproteins, proteases, outer membrane proteins, antibiotic and toxin resistance genes, stress survival genes and genes containing tetratricopeptide repeats . many of these gene products have been found to be associated with virulence and infection in numerous other bacterial pathogens have not been studied in brucella spp., calling for further investigation and characterization.

a blast search of the t4ss effector protein vcea against b. melitensis 16m revealed two genes with high and low degrees of similarity, bmei <dig> and bmeii <dig>  with  <dig> % and 35%  amino acid similarity. vcea  was found to be down-regulated at the exponential growth phase by the vjbr deletion mutant and the addition of c12-hsl  but was not statistically significant nor met the cut-off value of  <dig> -fold . additionally, a blast search of vcec revealed a gene with 99% amino acid similarity, bmei <dig>  which was found to be up-regulated by Δvjbr and treatment of c12-hsl in wildtype cells at the stationary growth phase . the vcec homologue, which is located downstream of a confirmed vjbr promoter sequence, was unexpectedly found to be down-regulated by vjbr and not up-regulated along with the t4ss   <cit> . expression of vcea was found to be promoted at the exponential growth phase by vjbr, however, no information was obtained at the stationary growth phase for comparison to virb in this global survey.

deletion of vjbr resulted in the down-regulation of a gene locus that encodes for the atp-binding protein associated with the cyclic β- glucan export apparatus  and an exopolysaccharide export gene exof  at the exponential growth phase; while the treatment of c12-hsl in the Δvjbr null background up-regulated these same genes  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively, . additionally, c12-hsl was found to down-regulate expression of opgc , responsible for substitutions to cyclic β- glucan,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold at the exponential growth phase in the wildtype and Δvjbr backgrounds   <cit> . cyclic β- glucan is crucial for the intracellular trafficking of brucella by diverting the endosome vacuole from the endosomal pathway, thus preventing lysosomal fusion and degradation and favoring development of the brucellosome  <cit> . mutations in the vjbr locus do not appear to have a profound effect on trafficking diversion from the early endosomal pathway; however, it is plausible that cyclic β- glucan and derivatives may be important for subsequent vacuole modulation and/or brucellosome maintenance during the course of infection  <cit> .

deletion of vjbr resulted in alteration in the expression of three adhesins: aida , aida- <dig>  at the exponential growth phase, and a gene coding for a cell surface protein  at the exponential growth phase . adhesins can serve as potent biological effectors of inflammation, apoptosis and cell recognition, potentially contributing to the virulence and intracellular survival of brucella spp.  <cit> . for instance, aida adhesins are important for bordetella pertussis recognition of host cells and in discriminating between macrophages and ciliated epithelial cells in humans  <cit> .

transporters. a large number of genes encoding transporters  were altered in Δvjbr or in response to the addition of c12-hsl to wildtype cultures . for example, an exporter of o-antigen  was identified to be down-regulated  <dig> -fold by the deletion of vjbr at an exponential growth phase, and  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold by the addition of c12-hsl to wildtype cells at exponential and stationary growth phases, respectively . among the differently expressed transporters, abc-type transporters were most highly represented, accounting for  <dig> out of the  <dig> transporter genes  . the correlation between abc transporters and the ability to adapt to different environments is in tune with the ability of brucella spp. to survive in both extracellular and intracellular environments  <cit> .

transcription. based on microarray analysis results, vjbr deletion or the addition of c12-hsl to wildtype cells altered the expression of  <dig> transcriptional regulators, comprised of  <dig> families and  <dig> two-component response regulators or signal transducing mechanisms . among the transcriptional families altered by Δvjbr and/or the addition of c12-hsl,  <dig> families  have been implicated in the regulation of virulence genes in a number of other pathogenic organisms  <cit> . the regulation of virb has been reported to be influenced not only by the deletion of vjbr and c12-hsl treatment, but by several additional factors including integration host factor , blxr, a stringent response mediator rsh, hutc, and arac   <cit> . the same arac transcriptional regulator was found to altered by vjbr deletion and c12-hsl treatment of wildtype cells: down-regulated  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold at exponential phase , and up-regulated  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold  at the stationary growth phase . additionally, hutc  was also found to be down-regulated at the exponential growth phase by the Δvjbr mutant , suggesting several levels of regulation for the virb operon by the putative qs components in b. melitensis .

in addition to transcriptional regulators linked to virulence, microarray analyses also revealed two differentially expressed transcriptional regulators that contain the luxr hth dna binding pfam domain . gene transcript bmeii <dig> was found to be down-regulated  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold in response to a vjbr deletion and addition of c12-hsl to wildtype cells  at an exponential growth phase . this luxr-like gene is located downstream of a vjbr consensus promoter sequence and thus most likely directly promoted by vjbr  <cit> . the second luxr-like gene, bmei <dig>  was up-regulated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold in the vjbr mutant and in response to exogenous c12-hsl at the exponential growth phase , and down-regulated  <dig> -fold by the deletion of vjbr at the stationary growth phase . this gene locus was not found to be located downstream of a predicted vjbr promoter sequence and may or may not be directly regulated by vjbr. additionally, blxr was found to be induced  <dig> -fold in wildtype cells treated with c12-hsl at the stationary growth phase by qrt-pcr . likewise, qrt-pcr verified a  <dig> -fold down-regulation of vjbr in wildtype cells supplied with exogenous c12-hsl at the stationary growth phase. the identification and alteration of genes containing the hth luxr dna binding domain by Δvjbr and c12-hsl administration, particularly one located downstream of the vjbr consensus promoter sequence, is of great interest. these observations potentially suggest a hierarchical arrangement of multiple transcriptional circuits which may or may not function in a qs manner, as observed in organisms such as p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

ahl synthesis. the deletion of vjbr or addition of c12-hsl resulted in alteration in the expression of  <dig> candidate ahl synthesis genes, based on the gene product's potential to interact with the known metabolic precursors of ahls, s-adenosyl-l-methionine  and acylated acyl carrier protein    <cit> . an e. coli expression system was utilized because b. melitensis has been shown to produce an aiid-like lactonase capable of inactivating c12-hsl  <cit> . cross streaks with e. coli ahl sensor strains and clones expressing candidate ahl synthesis genes failed to induce the sensor stains, while positive control e. coli clones expressing rhli and lasi from p. aeruginosa and exogenous 3-oxo-c12-hsl did in fact induce the sensor strains   <cit> .

c12-hsl regulates gene expression independent of vjbr
in addition to the investigation on the influences of a vjbr deletion or addition of c12-hsl to wildtype bacteria on gene expression, treatment of Δvjbr with exogenous c12-hsl was also assessed by microarray analyses. compared to untreated wildtype cells, 87% fewer genes were identified as differentially altered in response to c12-hsl in the vjbr null background as opposed to wildtype cells administered c12-hsl. in the absence of vjbr, exogenous c12-hsl altered the expression of  <dig> genes;  <dig> at the exponential growth phase and  <dig> genes at the stationary growth phase . of these  <dig> statistically significant altered transcripts, only  <dig> were commonly altered with the same magnitude by a deletion of vjbr or wildtype cells treated with c12-hsl . at the exponential growth phase, administration of c12-hsl exerted an equal effect on gene expression, up and down-regulating  <dig> and  <dig> genes . on the contrary, at the stationary phase all  <dig> genes were up-regulated, a dramatically different profile than the down-regulation observed for the majority of differently expressed genes in c12-hsl treated wildtype cells . collectively, this data supports that c12-hsl is capable of influencing gene expression independent of vjbr.

there is evidence that c12-hsl may interact with a second luxr homologue, blxr  <cit> . induction of blxr expression in response to c12-hsl was highly variable by microarray analysis; however, qrt-pcr revealed that blxr was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in bacteria lacking vjbr treated with c12-hsl, compared to  <dig> -fold in wildtype cells that were administered c12-hsl at the stationary growth phase. one possible explanation for this observation is that vjbr inhibits the induction of blxr by binding the ahl substrate and therefore lowering the cellular concentration of available c12-hsl for blxr induction, but has not been demonstrated.

interestingly, 58% of the gene transcripts found to be altered in an recent study of the function of Δblxr were also found to be altered by the addition of c12-hsl in the Δvjbr background, and increased to 88% if we lowered the threshold from our  <dig> -fold cutoff   <cit> . a second study that similarly examined the transcript and proteomic alterations due to a deletion in babr corresponded with  <dig> genes identified in our study: with  <dig> genes found to be unique to the addition of c12-hsl in the Δvjbr background , and  <dig> genes additionally altered by the deletion of vjbr or addition of c12-hsl in the wildtype background   <cit> . although many of these genes were not statistically significant in our analyses, this is a strikingly high correlation since the same conditions were not examined , as well as the use of differing microarray platforms and analyses procedures. this connection may suggest that the genes altered by the presence of c12-hsl in the absence of vjbr may be due to c12-hsl activation of blxr.

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this work was to provide an elementary understanding in the role of the putative qs components in the virulence and survival of b. melitensis. vjbr is a homologue of luxr, a transcriptional regulator previously shown to interact with an ahl signal c12-hsl and modulate expression of transcripts required for intracellular survival  <cit> . custom b. melitensis microarrays were utilized to examine the regulons controlled by vjbr and c12-hsl, revealing a large number of genes potentially involved in the virulence and intracellular survival of the organism. such genes include adhesins, proteases, lipoproteins, a hemolysin, secretion system components and effector proteins, as well as metabolic genes involved in energy production, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. furthermore, deletion of vjbr and c12-hsl treatment altered the expression of genes coding for components involved in the transport of numerous substrates across the cell membrane.

the microarray analyses conducted in this study also confirmed previous findings that flif and the virb operon are regulated by Δvjbr and exogenous c12-hsl treatment at an exponential growth phase and stationary growth phase , as well as the potential effector proteins vcea and vcec, validating the microarray approach to identify additional genes regulated by these putative qs components  <cit> . the contribution of vjbr gene regulation at different growth phases in not fully understood, but microarray analyses suggests that there are distinct sets of genes regulated at both growth phases in addition to the flagellar and t4ss operons. previous studies examining the effect of timing on qs related genes in p. aeruginosa hypothesized that the transcriptional regulator and not the inducing or repressing signal is responsible for the continuum of responses observed  <cit> . such a hypothesis is supported by the observed increase of vjbr expression over time in b. melitensis.

deletion of vjbr and treatment of c12-hsl both resulted in a global modulation of gene expression. examination of the relationship in respect to the genes commonly altered between Δvjbr and wildtype bacteria administered c12-hsl suggests that c12-hsl reduces vjbr activity, based upon the following observations: 1) an inverse correlation in gene expression for all but three genes found to be altered by vjbr and c12-hsl, 2) addition of exogenous c12-hsl to growth media mimics the deletion of vjbr in respect to gene alteration, 3) in the absence of vjbr, c12-hsl treatment has a markedly different effect on gene expression at the stationary growth phase, found to only promote gene expression, and 4) virb repression in response to the addition of c12-hsl is alleviated by deletion of the response receiver domain of vjbr  <cit> . the observed promotion of gene expression with the treatment of c12-hsl in a Δvjbr background could potentially be occurring through a second luxr-like protein blxr, supported by the high correlation of commonly altered genes by Δblxr and Δvjbr with the addition of c12-hsl in independent studies  <cit> . often, the luxr transcriptional regulator and ahl signal form a positive feedback loop, increasing the expression of luxr and the ahl synthesis gene  <cit> . the observed up-regulation of blxr by c12-hsl may be an example of such a feedback loop, further supporting an activating role c12-hsl and blxr activity.

although evidence is indirect, these observations suggest that there may be two dueling transcriptional circuits with the luxr transcriptional regulators . c12-hsl may provide a level of regulation between the two systems, deactivating vjbr and potentially activating blxr activity during the transition to stationary phase. it appears that c12-hsl reduces vjbr activity, alters expression of  <dig> additional transcriptional regulators that contain the luxr dna binding domain, induces expression of blxr and potentially activates gene expression through interactions with blxr. it would be interesting to determine if the decrease in virb expression observed in wildtype cells at stationary phase is a result of c12-hsl accumulation and subsequent "switching" of transcriptional circuits in vitro  <cit> . further experiments are needed to fully understand the temporal regulation of vjbr and associations with c12hsl, as well as indentification of ahl synthesis gene in brucella spp.

the role of the luxr transcriptional regulators vjbr and blxr and the ahl signal in relation to quorum sensing has not been fully deduced. continuing investigation of these putative qs components in vitro and in vivo will help determine if these components work in a qs-dependent manner in the host cell or if they function more in a diffusion or spatial sensing context to allow differentiation between intracellular and extracellular environments  <cit> . future experiments that elucidate how these processes contribute to the "stealthiness" of brucellae and will provide additional clues to the intracellular lifestyle of this particular bacterium.
