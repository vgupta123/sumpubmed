BACKGROUND
sox <dig> is a member of the sry-related hmg-box  transcription factor family with a set of well-established and diverse roles in stem cell potency and maintenance, embryonic development and cancer . it regulates extensive and often divergent transcriptional networks across different cell types  <cit> . sox <dig> is best known as a core pluripotency factor, maintaining the undifferentiated phenotype of pluripotent stem cells, and is closely co-regulated alongside core pluripotency factors oct <dig> and nanog in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells , embryonal carcinoma cells  and induced pluripotent stem cells   <cit> . loss of sox <dig> expression in these cell lines triggers their differentiation. more recently, sox <dig> has been identified as a crucial player in the maintenance and differentiation of adult stem cells such as in neural stem cells  <cit> . as an oncogene, sox <dig> has been implicated in many different malignancies of the central nervous, gastrointestinal, circulatory, respiratory, endocrine and skeletal systems, and also those of the skin, liver, gonads and breast . however, despite its oncogenic potential in numerous tumour types, the suppression of sox <dig> has been reported as a hallmark of gastric carcinoma . in malignancy growing evidence reveals sox <dig> to be a central regulator of a tumourigenic, stem cell-like subpopulation of tumour cells, frequently referred to as cancer stem cells , which are found to be responsible for the proliferative and invasive capacities of most tumour types  <cit> . many of the genes regulated by sox <dig> in normal stem cells are aberrantly regulated by this transcription factor in cancerous cells with a similar, albeit malignant phenotype.

micrornas  are a functional family of short , non-protein coding rna transcripts that primarily, but not exclusively, confer regulation of gene expression by targeting mrnas for degradation or transient translational repression by post-transcriptionally binding these in a directed manner  <cit> . they are involved in the regulation of almost all cell processes and maintain cell homeostasis in both healthy and disease conditions. in cancer and cscs, many mirnas have been identified as tumour suppressive or oncogenic mirnas   <cit> . many of these mirnas also have important regulatory functions in pluripotent cells, such as escs and eccs, and in embryonic development  <cit> .

although the sox <dig> transcriptome of protein coding genes has been previously mapped in various cell types and tissues, including eccs, with techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation  and gene array profiling, no extensive sox2-transcriptome analysis has been performed for mirnas in human pluripotent cells . some insight into the sox2-linked mirnaome in murine pluripotent cells has previously been provided by marson et al. who performed an extensive chip-sequencing  analysis of sox2-bound mirna promoters in mouse escs  <cit> . additionally, in a study of the sox <dig> regulatory network in human escs , boyer et al. produced a limited set of exclusively intragenic mirnas that were potentially regulated by the sox2-binding sites within the promoter regions of their respective host genes  <cit> . however, both marson et al. and boyer et al. provide no sox <dig> knock-down and mirna expression analysis to functionally link this transcription factor to specific mirnas. fang et al. profiled genes and mirnas regulated by sox <dig> in glioblastoma multiforme  cells  <cit> . notably absent from this study were an in-depth analysis of mirnas directly regulated by sox <dig> and a large scale combinatorial study of the gene target regulome of deregulated mirnas in these cells.

to map the functions of this mirna network in pluripotent cell and csc biology, we silenced sox <dig> in two human ecc  lines followed by a high-throughput expression analysis of expression changes in its associated mirna network. to reveal genes potentially regulated by sox <dig> through its linked mirna regulome, we profiled whole-genome differential mrna expression and applied a monte carlo algorithm to identify a subset of sox2-regulated mirnas that confer a significant regulatory signature on the differential gene expression profile in heccs. this type of analysis has been performed before and is enabled by the finding that the majority of total mirna-mediated gene suppression functions through mrna degradation, thus functional mirna activity can be determined by measuring the expression of their targets at the transcript level . finally, to identify candidate mirnas with a direct transcriptional association to sox <dig>  we applied existing sox <dig> chip-seq and mirna promoter data to our differential expression profiles.

to study sox <dig> in both a csc and pluripotent cell context, we chose the 2102ep and ntera- <dig> hecc lines, the csc component of teratocarcinoma, a type of germ cell tumour. the ntera- <dig> cell line is pluripotent and is frequently used as cell model to study ectodermal differentiation  <cit> . 2102ep cells are considered ‘nullipotent’ as they are resistant to retinoic acid-induced differentiation and form homogenous ec tumours when xenografted into mice  <cit> . 2102ep cell differentiation can however be induced by low-density growth or by silencing core pluripotency factors sox <dig> and oct <dig>  <cit> . because 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cell lines are phenotypically similar to hescs in an undifferentiated state and during early differentiation stages, they have previously been used as an alternative hesc model . for this study, 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells could provide significant insights into the post-transcriptional regulatory functions of sox <dig> towards both cancer stemness and embryonic stemness.

based on parameters set in our analysis we present several novel mirnas that are direct transcriptional targets of sox <dig>  indirect targets of this transcription factor included, we found many pro and anti-malignant mirnas that also have important functions in embryonic development. statistical analysis of whole-genome differential mrna expression revealed a distinct type  <dig> epithelial-to-mesenchymal  signature in an mirna/gene target regulatory network linked to sox <dig> 

RESULTS
sox <dig> knock-down in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells results in many altered mirnas involved in both cancer and embryonic development
sox <dig> was selected for rnai-mediated silencing in the two hecc lines and an sirna with specific complementarity to sox <dig> mrna . successful knock-down was confirmed by comparing sox <dig> mrna and protein expression with cells transfected with a non-targeting control . sox <dig> mrna was highly downregulated in 2102ep cells, while in ntera- <dig> cells 49% reduced mrna expression was reported. however, subsequent protein analysis showed that the sox <dig> protein expression was completely eliminated, confirming successful knock-down.as shown in figure 1c, distinct changes in cell morphology were recorded in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells three days after sisox <dig> transfection compared to cells transfected with a non-targeting sirna control. for both cell lines, the cells had a flatter and larger appearance. they were also more evenly dispersed in monolayers, which differed from their normal, undifferentiated phenotype as densely packed colonies. this phenotypic change is characteristic of ecc differentiation.figure  <dig> 
knock-down of sox <dig> in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells. the induced rnai of sox <dig> mrna by sox <dig> sirna  facilitated a substantial and significant down-regulation of this gene’s expression in the ec cell lines.  as determined by qrt-pcr, very little sox <dig> mrna expression remains  in sisox2-transfected 2102ep cells, while the remaining expression in sisox2-transfected ntera- <dig> cells is higher . sox <dig> expression was compared to that in cells transfected with a scrambled, non-targeting sirna , which was set at 100%. sox <dig> expression was normalised to gapdh expression. all experiments were performed in biological triplicate.  as determined by western blot, no sox <dig> protein could be detected in the sisox2-transfected cells of either cell line when compared to the non-targeting sirna-transfected controls , vehicle controls  or non-transfected controls . gapdh protein expression was measured to account for equal loading and transfer.  rnai phenotypes of 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells, four days after sox <dig> sirna transfection. sox2-silenced ec cells have a flattened, enlarged and more dispersed morphology, compared to sc-transfected cells, which are, similarly to untreated cells , small, defined and grown in dense colonies.



we profiled mirna expression using high-throughput quantitative real-time pcr  arrays in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells three days after transfecting them with sisox <dig> or a non-targeting, scrambled sirna control. this experiment tested the expression of  <dig> validated mirnas, covering the majority of the sanger mirbase v <dig> mirna database  <cit> . from this set of mirnas,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were significantly  deregulated in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells respectively . these include the minor strand  mirnas, which have increasingly been attributed with biological functions. the large majority of differentially expressed mirna in both cell lines were downregulated, suggesting that sox <dig> is predominantly a transcriptional activator of mirnas in heccs.figure  <dig>

 <dig> mirnas were mutually deregulated , of which four were mutually deregulated by over 2-fold each . another four mirnas were oppositely regulated , with mir-181a-2* showing a large difference between 2102ep  and ntera- <dig> cells . these results will be further detailed in following paragraphs.

many deregulated mirnas in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells after sox <dig> knock-down have previously reported oncogenic or tumour suppressive functions. in addition, many are actors in the maintenance of stem cell phenotypes or guide embryonic development and differentiation. we cross-analysed the deregulated mirnas in both hecc lines with hesc mirna data from stadler et al. and the mircancer database, a curated repository of oncomirs and tumour suppressor mirna  <cit> . table  <dig> contains a summary of deregulated mirnas that have roles in cancer and also are enriched in hescs or are differentially expressed during early hesc differentiation. this demonstrates great overlap of the deregulated mirnas in our dataset and many mirnas involved in cancer and stem cell biology.table  <dig>

the individual titles ‘downregulated’ and ‘upregulated’ indicate the differential expression of each mirna after sox <dig> knock-down in either 2102ep or ntera- <dig> cell lines or both.



we also compared the mirna profiles of the 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cell lines in their native, undifferentiated state. this comparison produced  <dig> differentially regulated mirna when both datasets are normalised to their respective global mean mirna expression . this substantial difference in mirna expression profiles could contribute to the divergence of differential mirna expression profiles in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells after sox <dig> knock-down.

statistical identification of an enriched mirna regulatory signature reveals the regulation of emt-related genes
current research has primarily focused on the direct action of sox <dig> on its transcriptional target genes in the context of pluripotency, differentiation and cancer. to expand the picture of sox <dig> regulation beyond this, we intended to identify sox2-linked mirnas that conferred a significant regulatory signature on the differential gene expression profile in heccs after sox <dig> knock-down.

for this approach, genome-wide gene expression arrays were used to generate differential gene expression profiles of the 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells from the same sox <dig> knock-down samples used for mirna profiling analysed against the same non-targeting control samples. all genes that were significantly ≥2-fold up or downregulated were included in further analysis and can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig>  using a monte carlo simulation algorithm combined with the mirna target-prediction software, targetscan  <dig> , we analysed the gene expression data to identify deregulated mirnas that target significantly more of the oppositely deregulated genes than would be expected by chance. this statistical method has previously been successfully applied to identify specific mirnas as ‘master regulators’ of one-carbon metabolism-linked genes and lipid metabolism genes  <cit> .

whole-genome profiling revealed the deregulation of  <dig> genes in 2102ep cells and  <dig> genes in ntera- <dig> cells, with  <dig> commonly deregulated genes between the two cell lines . gene ontology analysis revealed, particularly in 2102ep cells, the deregulation of many markers of embryonic development, early tissue morphogenesis, cell differentiation and respective pathways involved, such as the wnt pathway   <cit> . an expected feature was the upregulation of  <dig> functional markers of mesodermal differentiation and emt , with the exception of nrp <dig> in ntera- <dig> cells, which was downregulated in this cell line, but upregulated in 2102ep cells. previous evidence demonstrates the induction of emt and the acquisition of neural crest cell traits in hescs after sox <dig> knock down and the central roles of sox <dig> in this type of cell fate determination have been previously suggested  <cit> . this phenotypic change is particularly evident in 2102ep cells, which produced more altered markers than ntera- <dig> cells. in cancer, emt is a process of transdifferentiation by which epithelial cells lose their cell-cell adhesion and adopt a migratory mesenchymal phenotype enabling them to metastasise to other tissues. unexpectedly, some established emt inhibitors were upregulated in ntera- <dig>  and 2102ep cells   <cit> . this observation will be further touched upon in the discussion section. among the  <dig> emt markers, snai2/slug and cdh2/n-cadherin have been previously shown to be transcriptionally activated by sox <dig> during type  <dig> and type  <dig> emt respectively. in our data, these genes are upregulated after sox <dig> knock-down, suggesting an opposite transcriptional relation to sox <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, t/brachyury and eomes were previously found to be repressed by sox <dig> in type  <dig> emt, which is in concordance with our findings  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we performed monte carlo analysis on the 2102ep and ntera- <dig> differential gene expression datasets and cross-referencing with the results with the differential mirna expression results revealed  <dig> mirnas in 2102ep cells  and two mirnas in ntera- <dig> cells  to be potential master regulators of their inversely regulated target genes. certain human mirna families are broadly conserved across many vertebrate species, while the evolutionary conservation of others is limited to mammals or mammalian species of close common ancestry. the corollary is that poorly conserved mirnas may bind to poorly conserved target sites. to maximise the probability of identifying true mirna targets we limited our scope to target sites of equal conservation to their respective mirnas. while mir-26a, mir-30c, mir-148a, mir-200b, mir-200c and mir- <dig> are broadly conserved across vertebrate species, mir- <dig> is conserved only in mammals and mir-517b, mir-518f, mir-518b, mir-518c, mir-518a-3p, all as members of the c19mc polycistron, are found only in primates.

to identify high-probability gene targets we further filtered the results by microt-cds and miranda  cross-analysis and removed any targets that were not predicted by either of these tools   <cit> . the results are found in table  <dig> and with the added prediction scores in additional file 5: table s <dig>  the results reveal a combined set of  <dig> mirna-target interactions with  <dig> unique genes potentially regulated by our significant set of mirnas. of these,  <dig> mirna-target interactions are predicted by all three target prediction tools used in this study governing a high-confidence set of  <dig> unique genes,  <dig> of which have two or more high-confidence mirna interactions. this portrays a dense network of interlinking mirna-target regulation containing many previously validated mirna targets  and many potentially new targets.table  <dig>

many genes related to emt pathways were found to be regulated by several differentially expressed mirnas. of these, members of the mir- <dig> family have been the most extensively studied in this context  <cit> . we discovered that a group of  <dig> mirnas in table  <dig>  all of which were downregulated, could target  <dig> differentially expressed emt-related genes from both cell lines combined. four of these mirnas, mir-200b, mir- <dig>  mir-30c and mir-148a, are established inhibitors of emt and metastasis by targeting zeb <dig> and zeb <dig> , twf <dig> and vim  and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition    <cit> . additionally, mir-26a has targets that were verified in non-emt studies, but which have independently established functions in emt and metastasis. these include hmga <dig> and lef <dig>   <cit> . figure 3c illustrates a network of validated and novel sox2-mirna-target interactions found in this study. some of these interactions are further detailed in the discussion section.

meta-analysis of mirnas with sox <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions
to provide further insight into the mirna transcriptome under direct control by sox <dig>  we cross-analysed our profiling data with existing genome-wide sox <dig> chip data.

we first performed a meta-analysis of sox <dig> transcription factor binding sites  in proximity of mirna transcription start sites . at the time of this study, no previously published sox <dig> chip experiments were performed for hecc lines. because of this we adopted a similar strategy used by greber et al. and performed analysis with sox <dig> chip data from hescs as a substitute  <cit> . the assumption that sox <dig> binds similar genomic loci in both heccs and hescs was based on the evidence supporting a phenotypic similarity between these cell types and further supported by functional studies which show that sox <dig> has highly comparable roles in the maintenance and differentiation of these cell lines  <cit> . some differences do exist between hecc and hescs on the genetic and transcriptomic level, but current research accepts that this is limited to the expression and alternative splicing of only a relatively small number of genes  <cit> .

two whole-genome hesc sox <dig> chip datasets were included in the analysis; those previously published by boyer et al., and lister et al.
 <cit> 
. lister et al. performed chip-seq of the whole genome, while boyer et al. used a more limited chip-on-chip based method which covered the -8 kb to +2 kb genomic regions relative to transcription start sites of  <dig>  annotated genes.

secondly, we compiled a list of tsss from two resources: a dataset of mirna tsss identified by bulik-sullivan et al. and all host gene and mirna tsss from the mirstart database  <cit> . all mirnas with sox <dig> binding sites 5 kb upstream or downstream from their mirna tss and, where applicable, their host gene tss, were compiled and included in further analysis.

in total,  <dig> unique mirna precursors were found to have one or more sox <dig> binding sites . we compared this set of mirnas with all mirnas that we found to be significantly down or upregulated in the 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cell lines. from this analysis,  <dig> deregulated mature mirnas in 2102ep cells and  <dig> in ntera- <dig> cells were found to have proximal sox <dig> binding sites as shown in table  <dig>  in ntera- <dig> cells, all these mirnas were downregulated, while in 2102ep cells this transcriptional activity was mixed. only mir-135b* and mir-181a-2* were commonly listed for both 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells. this signifies a difference between the two hecc lines in response to sox <dig> downregulation.table  <dig>

none of the mirnas listed in table  <dig> have been validated before as transcriptional targets of sox <dig>  revealing a novel network of mirnas potentially directly regulated by sox <dig> in pluripotent cells. in general, few mirnas have so far been identified as direct transcriptional targets of sox <dig> in human cells. previous research efforts have focused on its regulation of the esc-specific mir-302- <dig> cluster and recently sox <dig> has been implicated in a direct negative feedback loop with the mir- <dig> family . despite the significant deregulation of mir-302c and mir-200b in 2102ep cells and mir-200c and mir- <dig> in ntera- <dig> cells, none of these mirnas were identified as sox <dig> transcriptional targets in our data. the false negative result for the mir-302- <dig> cluster can be explained by the absence of identifiable tsss for this cluster. however, two sox <dig> binding sites were found in a <2000 bp proximity of the mirna precursors, confirming previous reports. no sox <dig> binding sites were in proximity to the tsss of mir-200b and mir-200c as mapped by boyer et al. and lister et al.

a literature search revealed a substantial overlap of mirnas potentially controlled by sox <dig> as listed in table  <dig> and mirnas functionally linked to emt or its counterpart, met, in cancer or embryonic stem cell lines. table  <dig> column ‘expression during emt/met’ indicates the direction of differential expression during emt or met. with the exception of mir- <dig> and mir-181a in ntera- <dig> cells, the differential expression of all mirnas listed in table  <dig> correspond with their reported expression during emt or met.

additionally, with the aid of mirtarbase, a repository of validated mirna-target interactions, genes deregulated in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells after sox <dig> knock-down were included as previously validated targets  <cit> . only interactions validated with strong evidence  were included. notably, snai2/slug, an important emt gene, is upregulated in 2102ep cells, while its previously validated mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  are downregulated. both mirna are members of the same mir-183-96- <dig> cluster in the genome. this potentially presents alternative route through which sox <dig> controls snai2/slug transcription .

discussion
sox <dig> is a major pluripotency marker and oncogene. although previous studies have addressed the sox <dig> transcriptional profile of protein-coding genes in both hescs and heccs  <cit> , no study has yet profiled the sox <dig> mirna profile in human pluripotent cells. successful previous attempts have mapped the direct transcriptional mirna network of sox <dig> in mouse escs and human gbm, but no integrated differential gene and mirna expression analysis was performed and none exist in human pluripotent stem cells  <cit> . the basis of this study was to attempt such analysis and to provide a platform for future sox <dig> and pluripotency-linked mirna-target discovery and validation.

eccs have been previously used as a model to study cancer stemness, escs and embryonic development  <cit> . as cscs of embryonal carcinoma and teratocarcinoma, they have been subjects of cancer stemness studies, while their phenotypical similarities with escs have kept eccs interesting to researchers who study embryonic development and esc biology. recently, these fields have converged in research which utilises eccs as a model to investigate esc and ipsc tumourgenicity and cancer cells expressing embryonic biomarkers  <cit> .

mirna profiling after sox <dig> knock-down reveals a distinct phenotypes in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells
we profiled the differential expression of  <dig> mirnas in two sox <dig> knock-down ecc lines. to our best knowledge, this is the first study to map a sox2-linked mirna network by a high-throughput method in human pluripotent cell lines. mirna profiling revealed the significant deregulation  <dig> and  <dig> unique mature mirnas in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells, of which only  <dig> were common between these groups, with four mirnas of this subset oppositely deregulated. the large difference in mirna response to sox <dig> knock-down signifies the phenotypic differences between the 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cell lines which is further supported by the different mirna profiles between undifferentiated 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells.

however, the mirna profiles in both cell lines showed certain features expected in hescs after sox <dig> silencing. in 2102ep cells, several esc-specific mirnas were downregulated, most notably  <dig> members of the c19mc polycistron. in ntera- <dig> cells, this cluster is expressed, but only two of its mirnas  were downregulated. c19mc is located on chromosome 19q <dig>  and conserved to primates only. in normal tissue, its mirnas are specifically expressed in escs, eccs and placental tissue. although the precise function of c19mc is still quite elusive, its expression is rapidly lost during early esc differentiation  <cit> . however, c19mc re-expresses in several cancer types and in particular embryonal brain tumours in which it activates an early developmental program by driving global methylation changes  <cit> . the downregulation of c19mc after sox <dig> knock-down in 2102ep cells and its its apparent resistance to this in ntera- <dig> cells aligns the phenotype of the former cell line closer to that of hesc differentiation than the latter.

mirna profiling after sox <dig> knock-down expands the autoregulatory network of core pluripotency factors
the differential expression of three mirnas, mir-9*, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which have previously been validated to target sox <dig>  suggests the possible existence of novel autoregulatory loops between sox <dig> and mirnas it directly or indirectly regulates. mir-9*, which is upregulated in 2102ep , and mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which are upregulated and downregulated in ntera- <dig> respectively , all have been validated to repress sox <dig> . while the downregulation of mir- <dig> points towards a negative feedback mechanism, the upregulation of mir-9*, which has a proximal sox <dig> binding site in its promoter region , and mir- <dig> indicates the existence of positive feedback loops. in fact, fang et al., who found similar deregulation of mir- <dig> upon the knock down of sox <dig> in gbm cells, proposed this association  <cit> .

expanding these autoregulatory networks beyond the direct targeting of sox <dig> reveals additional regulatory connections between sox2-targeted mirnas  and regulators of sox <dig> expression. the pluripotency factor nanog reciprocally induces sox <dig> expression and both can cooperatively enhance their own expression in stem cells, including escs, eccs and cscs  <cit> . as expected, nanog was similarly downregulated in both ecc lines in this study. in hematopoietic stem cells, mir-181a-2*, a member of the mir- <dig> family and deregulated in both 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells, can directly target nanog  <cit> . the expression of the mir- <dig> family increases during early hesc differentiation and has previously been identified as regulators of stem cell differentiation, including that of hescs and cscs . we found that the mir-181a/-2a* precursor contains a sox <dig> binding site in close proximity to its tss , suggesting its direct regulation of these mirnas. mir-181a-2* was upregulated in 2102ep cells, while its complement strand mir-181a was similarly upregulated just outside the minimal threshold of statistical significance . if mir-181a-2* targets nanog during 2102ep differentiation, this would present an alternative mechanism of nanog regulation by sox <dig> in this ecc line, and possibly other cell lines.

integrated analysis reveals a distinct emt mirna-target regulatory network
from a statistical cross-analysis of mirna and gene profiling data we identified  <dig> mirnas that controlled a combined set of  <dig> deregulated genes, of which  <dig> were predicted by three computational target prediction tools. this set was enriched with a subgroup of  <dig> genes involved in emt . sox <dig> has recently been directly linked to emt and metastasis in cancer, and as an oncogene is considered to be a promoter of emt during disease progression . although the precise mechanisms by which sox <dig> contributes are still quite elusive, its cancer stem cell regulatory and emt functions probably overlap. so far, one study found that its transcriptional regulation of the wnt/β-catenin pathway was a contributing factor  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that emt could attribute to the generation of cscs, possibly further implicating sox <dig> in a network of tumorigenesis and progression though its expression in a cancer cell subpopulation  <cit> .

from our results we present an expanded network of mirna interactions, directly and indirectly regulated by sox <dig>  that could govern emt during embryonic development and in cscs. the significant representation of known and putative mirna inhibitors of emt with validated emt targets  provides functional significance to the wider sox2-regulated mirna-target network revealed in this study. furthermore, independent from the statistical target analysis, mir-9/9*, a highly characterised promoter of emt and upregulated in 2102ep cells, has a sox2-binding site in its promoter region , further revealing a sox2-linked mirna emt network  <cit> .

this network includes highly characterised mesenchymal markers such as zeb <dig>  lef <dig>  fn <dig> , cdh <dig> , snai <dig>  and snai <dig> . nearly all genes in this upregulated group of genes are promoters or effectors of emt. the exception is cdh1/e-cadherin in ntera- <dig> cells, which normally downregulates during emt, while it is upregulated in our dataset. the latter cannot be fully explained without further experimentation. overall, the results demonstrate a mirna link between sox <dig> and emt-related genes in 2102ep cells. in a recent study, cimadamore et al. demonstrate that the differentiation of hescs to sensory neurons rely on a transient up- and downregulation of sox <dig> expression  <cit> . sox <dig> expression reduces during the initial differentiation and emt of hescs to neural crest cells after which sox <dig> is re-expressed during the differentiation of these cells towards neuronal progenitors. the induction of emt genes in 2102ep cells represent the first phase of this differentiation program and the detailed network of mirna-target interactions we present in our study could assist this process. furthermore, despite their pluripotency, ntera- <dig> cells appear have a limited capacity of undergoing this transformation or perhaps represent a more progressed phenotype along this differentiation program as suggested by the upregulation of cdh1/e-cadherin and the downregulation of nrp <dig>  the induction of a combined gene and mirna emt programme by sox <dig> knock-down in 2102ep cells suggest the activation of a form of type  <dig> emt.

mirna promoter analysis links sox <dig> transcriptional function to validated emt mirnas
the characterisation of a mirnas with sox <dig> binding sites in their promoter region yielded a subset of deregulated mirnas in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> that are highly probable to be transcriptionally regulated by sox <dig>   <dig> mirnas have been previously validated as functional activators or inhibitors of emt or met. in 2102ep cells, inhibitors of emt, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  and an activator of met, mir- <dig>  are all upregulated. conversely, an inhibitor of emt, mir- <dig>  is downregulated. this further supports the hypothesis of sox <dig> as a regulator and an inhibitor of type  <dig> emt in 2102ep cells. in ntera- <dig> cells, mir-124-3p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181a are downregulated. however, only mir-124-3p and mir- <dig> are inhibitors of emt, while mir- <dig> and mir-181a are activators. as indicated by the differential expression of certain genes in ntera- <dig> cells, this could be representative of a more progressed phenotype. this has been suggested before, for despite their pluripotent nature, ntera- <dig> cells appear to be intrinsically primed towards neural differentiation, a process also governed by sox <dig>  <cit> . unbiased screening of the mirnas in table  <dig> with validated targets from mirtarbase yielded only few genes that were deregulated in 2102ep and ntera- <dig> cells. it is possible that functional response of targets of these mirnas is delayed or that these mirnas confer their functionality through translational repression. furthermore, curated databases such as mirtarbase only represent a fraction of the results in the literature and, as such, several validated targets may been missed.

a direct association between master regulator mirnas  and mirnas with sox <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions  could not be found. this may be due to the high stringency of statistical approach to identifying master regulator mirnas taken in this study rather than an alternative sox <dig> binding profile to mirna promoter regions. despite this, the master regulators, mir-200b, mir-200c and mir- <dig>  have been previously established transcriptional targets of sox <dig>  indicating that this transcription factor could have a large influence on the targets of these mirnas through their genomic regulation .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we profiled the sox2-linked mirnaome and its associated regulatory network in pluripotent and nullipotent cancer stem cells. the findings add to a growing body of results that map the cell and context specific multifunctionality of sox <dig> in the maintenance and direction of stem cell phenotypes. the results presented in this study suggest a mirna link between sox <dig> and type  <dig> emt markers in the 2102ep ecc line. the apparent role of sox <dig> as an inhibitor of emt during embryonic development is opposite of its role as a promoter emt in metastatic neoplasms, even though many of the same mirnas are involved. future research could further and individually validate the presented mirnas and targets in relation to sox2-linked emt, embryonic development and cancer.
