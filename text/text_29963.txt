BACKGROUND
protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification involving a highly conserved 76-amino acid protein called ubiquitin , which regulates a multitude of targets in eukaryotes . in plants, ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of various biological processes including growth and development, response to biotic and abiotic stress signalling, and regulation of chromatin structure . the covalent attachment of ub to a diverse array of target proteins requires a cascade of reactions catalysed by three kinds of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme , ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme , and ubiquitin ligase enzyme . e3s are the most diverse enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade and are probably the main determinant of substrate specificity  <cit> . e <dig> proteins are classified into three classes according to the presence of one of the following domains: homology of the e6-ap c-terminus , u-box, or really interesting new gene . these domains act mainly as e <dig> docking sites.

ubiquitination is initiated by e1-dependent activation of ub in an atp-dependent reaction, ultimately forming a thioester linkage between an e <dig> catalytic cys residue and the carboxyl-terminal gly of ub. this activated ub is then transferred via thioester linkage to a catalytic cys residue within the ubc domain of e <dig>  finally, e <dig> proteins identify the target protein and mediate formation of an isopeptide bond between the c-terminal gly carboxyl group of ub and a target lys ε-amino group. depending on the type of e <dig>  ub transfer to the target protein in the final step occurs directly from the e <dig>  or after thioester formation of ub with the e <dig>   <cit> . the outcomes of the e1-e2-e <dig> enzymatic reactions vary greatly since they may add one or more ub to the target protein  in different configurations  <cit> . consequently, ubiquitination can act as a signal for protein activation, degradation by the 26s proteasome, intracellular localization, vesicular trafficking, or histone modification and transcription regulation  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, the genes encoding the enzymes that mediate ub modification represent a significant fraction of the genome  <cit> . two related genes encode e <dig> in the arabidopsis genome, ubiquitin activating  <dig>  and ubiquitin activating  <dig>   <cit> . these proteins share about 80 % amino acid identity with each other, as well as conserved amino acid sequences with mammalian and yeast enzymes  <cit> . in the case of e2s, the arabidopsis genome encodes  <dig> proteins that contain a conserved region of approximately 140– <dig> amino acids, called the ubc domain  <cit> . thirty-seven of  <dig> ubc domain-containing proteins are thought to conjugate to ub . another eight lack the catalytic cys called ubiquitin enzyme variants , and the remaining three catalyse the conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins . the  <dig> ubcs have been classified into  <dig> subgroups according to their identity with each other  <cit> . for e3s, more than  <dig> genes are predicted to encode e <dig> ligase components in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the hect and u-box domain-containing proteins are encoded by seven and  <dig> genes, respectively  <cit> , while more than  <dig> genes encode the ring domain-containing proteins  <cit> . the e3s that utilize the ring domain for e <dig> binding can be subdivided into simple and complex e3s. in many cases, the simple ring e3s contain both the e <dig> binding domain  and the substrate binding domain within a single protein, whereas in other cases, they may act as homo or heterodimers of two different ring proteins  <cit> . on the other hand, the complex ring e3s contain multiple different proteins. best characterized are the cullin-ring ligase  e3s, consisting, in arabidopsis, of cullin <dig>  cul3a/b or cul <dig>  which serve as a platform linking one of two closely related ring-type proteins  to one of over  <dig> substrate-recognition subunits  <cit> . for ease of in vitro characterisation, in our study, we focused on the simple arabidopsis ring e3s.

the ring-type e <dig> ligases share a cys-rich ring domain that contains eight conserved cys and/or his residues and binds two zinc  ions  <cit> . some other domains, such as the zn finger, lim, and phd, also showed similar patterns of cys and his residues as found in the ring domain, although they differ in their folding and function  <cit> . the eight zn-coordinating residues in the ring domain form a cross-brace structure with zn ions, which acts as a platform for e <dig> interaction  <cit> . the arabidopsis ring proteins were classified into three ring types  and five modified ring types  based on the type of zn-coordinating residues and the number of amino acids between them  <cit> . mutations in one or more of these zn-coordinating residues may disrupt the ring domain to mediate protein ubiquitination.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬

as the requirements of ring e3s activity in vitro are believed to be identical to those in vivo, even in the absence of their physiological substrates  <cit> , functional characterization of gene products of ring e3s is possible. to our knowledge, the largest scale analysis performed previously utilised proteins expressed in e. coli cells. ubiquitination activity of ~ <dig> ring e <dig> ligases was first tested in vitro with atubc <dig>  <cit> , then with representative members of different ubc subfamilies  <cit> . whereas the majority of ring e3s tested showed activity,  <dig> ring e3s showed no activity with all e2s tested  <cit> . seven e2s were insoluble after expression using e. coli and/or cultured insect cells  <cit> , preventing their utilization in ubiquitination assays. it is possible that one of these e2s is required for the activity of these apparently inactive e3s, the e3s were expressed with improper folding or additional proteins are required. therefore, in our study we used a eukaryotic cell-free system to express and analyse the activity of arabidopsis e2s and ring e3s. biochemical characterisation of gene products using cell-free protein synthesis systems is very convenient because cellular toxicity is not a concern  <cit> . in particular, the wheat germ cell-free system, which is a eukaryotic expression system and more closely resembles endogenous expression of plant proteins showed successful expression of several multi-domain eukaryotic proteins in functional form  <cit> . for large-scale analysis of arabidopsis e2s and ring e3s, we used the riken arabidopsis full-length  cdna library as the main source of e2s and ring e3s cdnas. using the ‘split-primer’ pcr method for the high-throughput preparation of transcription templates and the wheat germ cell-free system, we constructed protein libraries including  <dig> e2s and  <dig> ring e3s. finally, we demonstrated biochemical activity for all e2s expressed and for representative ring e3s using wheat germ crude extracts.

RESULTS
the wheat germ cell-free system expressed  <dig> of the  <dig> arabidopsis e2s
we aimed to collect as many cdna clones as possible for e2s that are currently annotated in arabidopsis in order to express them using wheat germ cell-free system and to test their functional activity. the arabidopsis genome is predicted to encode  <dig> genes thought to function as e2s  <cit> . we collected the cdna clones for these  <dig> genes either from rafl cdna library  <cit>  or from other resources outlined in table  <dig>  using the ‘split-primer’ pcr and the  <dig> cdna clones as templates, we prepared the transcription templates by adding the sequences of the sp <dig> promoter, e <dig> enhancer region, and biotin ligase site  to the 5’-end . this method is suitable for high-throughput preparation of transcription templates  <cit> . in vitro transcription followed by translation by the bilayer mode of wheat germ cell-free system surprisingly yielded the expression of 35 n-terminal biotinylated  e2s from the  <dig> genes . this expression analysis represents the largest collection of translated arabidopsis e2s compared with previous studies. a group of e2s including ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  and ubc <dig>  which had not previously been expressed in vitro  <cit> , was successfully expressed using the wheat germ cell-free system. only the ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> proteins were not expressed using our expression system. their mrna level was comparable to others, but we could not detect the corresponding protein by immunoblotting analysis. ubc <dig> was reported to undergo extensive proteolysis when expressed in bacteria  <cit> , whereas ubc <dig> was not expressed when either e. coli or cultured insect cells were used  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of arabidopsis e2s used in this study, their protein expression in a wheat germ cell-free system and activity as e <dig> enzymes

all expressed e2s catalysed dtt-sensitive ub conjugation in vitro
after  <dig> arabidopsis e2s were expressed using the wheat germ cell-free system, it was important to check whether these expressed proteins were functionally active in vitro, in particular the six e2s whose expression had not previously been reported. e2s activity are determined either through their ability to form a thioester linkage with ub in a ‘thioester assay’, which is independent of an e <dig>  or through their requirement in the ubiquitination activity of specific ring e3s. because of the uncertainty in e2-e <dig> specificity and the large number of ring e3s in the arabidopsis genome, we preferred to use the e3-independent thioester assay for all expressed e2s. in this type of assay, the reactions are terminated under reducing conditions  or under non-reducing conditions . in contrast to the 8 m urea treatment, the dtt treatment cleaves the thioester linkage between the e <dig> active site cysteine and the carboxyl terminus of ub  <cit> .

to evaluate the possibility of conducting thioester assays using the e2-containing wheat germ extract, we tested n-bio-ubc <dig> as a representative e <dig> for its ability to form thioester linkage with ub in the presence or absence of flag-tagged ub  and/or rabbit e <dig> . immunoblotting analysis using anti-flag-hrp , revealed dtt-sensitive ub conjugation regardless of the addition of e <dig> , which suggests activity of the we <dig>  this figure also reveals another dtt-sensitive signal equivalent to that of e1-ub was detected by an anti-flag antibody in the absence of e <dig> , which also refers to we <dig> activity. immunoblot analysis with streptavidin-hrp detected the unmodified bio-ubc <dig>  and revealed an additional dtt-sensitive band shifted in size equivalent to single ub adduct . the band shift was also detected regardless of the addition of flag-ub suggesting the presence of endogenous wheat germ ub. taken together, these results confirm the activity of wheat germ endogenous e <dig> and the presence of ub in the wheat germ extract, consistent with a previous report  <cit> .

accordingly, we tested the activity of 35 n-bio-e2s by a wheat germ-based thioester assay, relying on the activity of endogenous e <dig>  remarkably, all  <dig> e2s expressed were able to catalyse dtt-sensitive ub conjugation in in vitro assays based on the wheat germ extract after blotting against flag-ub . this included six e2s that have never been expressed before , and other e2s that were expressed in previous studies but showed no activity , and e2s that activated certain e3s but were not successful in thioester linkage formation with ub . some e2s including ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> appeared as two bands on immunoblot analysis. background of probable wheat germ endogenous e2s  was detected at about 25– <dig> kda, but fortunately, those signals were weak enough to allow the activity of recombinant e2s to be distinguished . since wheat germ extract may contain active e3s  <cit> , we were unable to determine whether the activity of these e2s depended on the presence of a specific e <dig> or other protein, such as an activator.fig.  <dig> thioester assay of  <dig> arabidopsis e2s. the crude proteins for each of the  <dig> bio-e2s were incubated with flag-ub for 5 min at 37 °c and treated with dtt or 8 m urea . immunoblot analysis against flag-ub using anti-flag-hrp antibodies shows the presence of dtt-sensitive ub conjugation activity for all e2s tested. arrows show the expected e2-ub adduct for each e <dig> in the absence of dtt. the side arrows show the free flag-ub and expected flag-ub adducts with we <dig> and we <dig> as arranged from bottom to top



a total of  <dig> arabidopsis ring proteins were expressed using the wheat germ cell-free system
the arabidopsis genome is predicted to encode more than  <dig> ring domain-containing proteins  <cit> . to construct a protein library of arabidopsis ring proteins, we collected  <dig> cdna clones from the rafl library  <cit>  according to the annotated ring proteins  <cit>  and annotated genes in rafl database  <cit> . we prepared transcription templates with an n-terminal flag-tag sequence using the ‘split-primer’ pcr method . we were able to construct transcription templates for  <dig> ring clones  . following expression using the bilayer mode of the wheat germ cell-free system, expression was confirmed for  <dig> of the  <dig> ring protein-encoding mrnas by immunoblot analysis . fifteen rnas were expressed at relatively low levels. we compared the sizes of the expressed proteins against the expected molecular weights, as recorded in the rafl database. we note that not all cdna clones from rafl matched the representative gene model in tair v <dig>  therefore, we mainly used the rafl information to make comparisons since it was the source of the cdnas used in the synthesis of our ring protein library. accordingly, all but seven of the  <dig> expressed proteins had molecular weights that match those predicted . these seven proteins were >  <dig> kda smaller than their expected rafl sizes and were considered to be truncated . interestingly, upon detection of expressed ring proteins, we noticed a group of  <dig> proteins with anti-flag high molecular smears or with immunoreactivity at very high molecular masses near the top of the resolving gel . because ring proteins are predicted to function as ub e <dig> ligases and the wheat germ extract contains endogenous e <dig>  e <dig>  and ub, we hypothesized that these smears and high molecular mass forms result from ub ligase activity.fig.  <dig> immunoblot analysis of the n-terminal flag-tagged ring protein library expressed by the wheat germ cell-free system. for analysis, 2 μl of crude recombinant ring proteins with n-terminus flag tag was loaded onto sds-page and detected by anti-flag-hrp antibody. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> ring proteins analysed were detected. arrows show the expected signal for each ring protein. blue asterisks refer to proteins with high molecular smears, while red asterisks refer to ring proteins did not show high molecular smears and were subsequently used in the in vitro ubiquitination analysis 

 the table shows the expression and ubiquitination activities of representative arabidopsis ring proteins used in this study . ‘m. wt. ’ indicates the expected molecular weight of the expressed proteins according to the rafl database. ‘high molecular smear’ indicates the detection of a smear: awhen ring protein expression was detected by immunoblot analysis or bwhen analysed in ubiquitination assays without the addition of e <dig> or e <dig>  ‘activity with ubc8/10’ indicates the e <dig> ligase activity of selected ring proteins tested with catubc <dig>  <cit>  or datubc <dig> in this study. ‘activity with other e2s’ indicates the e <dig> ligase activity of selected ring proteins tested along with various e2s in eprevious study  <cit>  or fin this study. ‘truncated’ refers to proteins that were more than  <dig> kda less than their expected size. ‘low expression’ refers to proteins expressed at relatively low levels. abbreviations: yes, detected; no, not detected; nd, not tested



ring proteins catalyse ubiquitination activity using we <dig> and we2
to verify whether the smears and high molecular mass forms that appeared after the expression of some ring proteins resulted from ring activity in the extract, we introduced a point mutation at the codon for the third metal ligand residue required for maintaining the ring domain structure and function   <cit> . we selected at4g <dig> as a representative ring protein for this experiment, because it produced a readily detectable high molecular smear after expression . an in vitro ubiquitination assay using wild-type n-bio-at4g <dig>  and its corresponding ring mutant n-bio-at4g <dig>  was performed. as shown in fig. 4a, at4g <dig>  promoted production of a high molecular weight smear with or without added e <dig> or e <dig> . in contrast, the ring mutant of at4g <dig>  showed a significantly diminished ability to promote the production of a high molecular weight smear. this result indicates that ring protein activity is required for production of a ub smear and for these proteins is independent of arabidopsis e <dig> and e <dig>  likely utilizing we <dig> and we <dig>  to further test this hypothesis, we selected three other ring proteins that also showed high molecular smears when expressed. these were at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  these proteins as well as at4g <dig> were expressed with biotin tags. similarly, a point mutation was introduced at the codon for the third metal ligand residue of each protein, and both forms were tested using in vitro ubiquitination assays. the ability of the ring mutants to promote ubiquitination was drastically diminished in comparison to the activity of their corresponding wild-type proteins . these data demonstrate that the expressed ring proteins have functional activity using we <dig> and we <dig>  in addition, the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins when expressed in the wheat germ cell-free system also suggests the presence of endogenous ub and reduced or inactivity of the wheat germ 26s proteasome, which is also consistent with previous report  <cit> .fig.  <dig> wheat germ-based in vitro ubiquitination analysis of ring proteins showed high molecular smears. a at4g <dig> and its corresponding ring mutant were expressed with biotin tag and analysed as a representative protein in the presence or absence of flag-ub, e <dig>  and/or atubc <dig> without tag for the ubiquitination activity. replacement of the third metal ligand, cys to ser, caused reduced smear upon blotting against flag-ub with anti-flag-hrp antibody. absence of the e <dig> or atubc <dig> from the reaction did not abolish the high molecular smear. b three other ring proteins at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  and their ring mutants together with at4g <dig>  were analysed in the presence of flag-ub. the four proteins with ring mutants showed significantly reduced activity upon blotting with anti-flag-hrp antibody, whereas the proteins with intact ring domains showed activity without the addition of e <dig> or e <dig>  the side arrow refers to the free flag-ub that migrated to the bottom of the gel



ring proteins exhibit ubiquitination activity with atubc10
while  <dig> ring proteins had clear high molecular smears when expressed in the wheat germ cell-free system indicating activity, the majority of the other ring proteins expressed did not exhibit activity. to test the functional activity of these ring proteins we conducted in vitro ubiquitination assays for  <dig> ring proteins with the addition of flag-ub and n-bio-ubc <dig> to increase the sensitivity of the assay and to see whether arabidopsis e <dig> is essential. the  <dig> ring proteins included various types of ring proteins . some ring proteins showed polyubiquitination activity only after the addition of ubc <dig>  suggesting that these ring proteins require this arabidopsis e <dig>  or that this e <dig> type is not present in wheat germ. in contrast, other ring proteins showed polyubiquitination activity in the absence of ubc <dig>  suggesting that these ring proteins can exhibit weak activity using we <dig>  which can be detected clearly after adding flag-ub.fig.  <dig> wheat germ-based in vitro ubiquitination assays of various types of ring proteins.  <dig> flag-tagged ring proteins of various ring types were mixed with flag-ub in the presence or absence of n-bio-ubc <dig> as indicated by plus  or minus  above each lane. e <dig> activity was determined by the presence or absence of a smear when flag-ub was detected by anti-flag-hrp antibody. this is indicated by plus  or minus , respectively, below each lane respectively



ring proteins exhibit ubiquitination activity with different e <dig> subfamilies
to further test the functional activity of ring proteins, we selected three ring proteins  that were reported to be inactive when tested with different arabidopsis e2s  <cit> . another ring protein, which mediates monoubiquitination of histone h2b named histone monoubiquitination  <dig> , was also tested. hub <dig> was reported to specifically use ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> for monoubiquitination of h2b in vitro and in vivo  <cit> ; therefore, it was of interest to see whether other e2s could promote hub <dig> activity. we tested the activity of these four proteins using the wheat germ-based in vitro ubiquitination assays in the presence of e2s from different subgroups. all the ring proteins tested showed relatively intensive smears with two subfamily vi e2s ubc <dig> and ubc <dig>  and in some cases with subfamily xiii e <dig> ubc <dig>  for at2g <dig>  smears in the presence of ubc <dig> was the most pronounced, while that in the presence of ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> was slightly lower. hub <dig> showed strong smears with ubc <dig> and ubc <dig>  and moderate one with ubc <dig>  atl <dig> also showed relatively intensive smears with ubc <dig> as well as ubc <dig> and ubc <dig>  taken together, these results suggest the activity of some ring proteins that did not exhibit activity when expressed previously using e. coli cells, indicating the importance of the eukaryotic expression system in functional analysis of arabidopsis proteins.fig.  <dig> wheat germ-based in vitro e2-e <dig> specificity screening. the activity of four flag-tagged ring e3s was tested in the presence of members of different subgroups of n-bio-e2s and ha-ub. arabidopsis e2s used in each assay are indicated above each lane according to their ubc number and minus  refers to the absence of e2; this condition was used as a negative control. the e2–e <dig> activity was visualized after sds-page by anti-ha-hrp immunoblotting. the number below each lane represents the signal intensity quantified by imagej as normalized to the lane lacking for e <dig> 



discussion
complete genome sequences make it substantially easier to deduce the function of genes by identifying conserved domains in the putative proteins encoded by these genes  <cit> . however, definitive assignment requires experimental verification. for the genes encoding the enzymatic core of the ubiquitination pathway in arabidopsis, a large fraction of the proteins encoded by these genes are biochemically uncharacterised. in this study, we expressed about 95 % of the arabidopsis e <dig> proteome  using the wheat germ cell-free system . this protein library included all of the e2s that have been previously characterised  <cit> . members of subfamily xiv, which contain predicted transmembrane domains, were expressed without deletions. in addition, members of subfamily xi, which are exclusively large proteins, and some members of subfamily vii; ubcs 16– <dig>  were not expressed using e. coli or cultured insect cells  <cit> , but were successfully expressed using the wheat germ cell-free system. surprisingly, all of the  <dig> expressed e2s showed dtt-sensitive ub conjugation activity , confirming the advantage of the eukaryotic wheat germ-based protein expression system for studying eukaryotic protein functions. through this study, we provided the largest collection of the most important enzymes in the ubiquitination process in functional form. this advantage makes the in vitro analysis of various e3s possible and can improve our understanding of e2-e <dig> specificity in arabidopsis.

using the wheat germ cell-free system, we were also able to synthesize a protein library of  <dig> arabidopsis ring e3s, which represents more than 40 % of the arabidopsis ring proteome . to our knowledge, this is also the largest collection of expressed ring proteins reported. the availability of full-length cdna libraries like rafl and a pcr-based method for preparing linear transcription templates like the ‘split-primer’ pcr enabled us to explore the products of such large number of genes in vitro. in comparison with the conventional cloning and expression approach, our approach bypassed the time-consuming subcloning steps into expression vectors and led to high-throughput protein expression when combined with the wheat germ cell-free system  <cit> . we have demonstrated the activity of  <dig> ring proteins as e <dig> ligases,  <dig> of them were demonstrated for the first time .

it is important to note that the  <dig> genes were amplified under similar conditions, and transcribed and translated under the same conditions for the high-throughput synthesis of the protein library. future modifications to the pcr conditions according to the nature of each template cdna may yield more transcription templates. furthermore, in our study we could collect from the rafl cdna library  <dig> ring clones out of about  <dig> annotated ring genes. the addition of the remaining ring cdnas, from sources other than the rafl cdna library, may improve the coverage of our protein library, and would improve any future analyses.

the thioester and in vitro ubiquitination assays normally require protein purification from either recombinant expression or from its native source and the addition of commercially available components such as ub and e <dig>  accordingly, large scale in vitro analysis could be laborious and costly. e2s such as atubc <dig> and atubc <dig>  and ring e3s such as cip <dig> were reported to catalyse ubiquitination when analysed using wheat germ crude extracts without exogenous e <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we tested the activity of  <dig> e2s and several e3s using in vitro assays based on their crude extract without purification and without addition of e <dig>  blotting against flag-ub in thioester assays of e2s like ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig>  ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> showed two bands . in case of ubc <dig>  previous reports clearly showed its unique capability to conjugate with one or more ub molecules . while in case of other e2s, further investigations are required to examine whether they may have similar capability or this extra band appeared because of unspecific ub addition on e <dig>  its tag or ub tag.

the detection of ubiquitinated species after ring protein expression  also suggests the stability of ubiquitinated proteins in the wheat germ extract. this finding is consistent with a previous study  <cit> , and may suggest that 26s proteasomal activity is absent in the wheat germ extract. verification of proteasomal activity has become possible using fluorescent reporters  <cit> . all the  <dig> e3s tested in our study showed activity with ubc <dig> and/or ubc <dig>  which are related to the human ubch <dig> family. these e2s are abundantly expressed in almost all plant organs  <cit>  and considered as promiscuous e2s  <cit> . so, it is not surprising that they can function with most e3s. even hub <dig> e <dig> which has been shown to specifically use ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> for monoubiquitination of h2b  <cit> , showed strong activity with ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> in our study. that suggests that ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> may perform a general ubiquitination function in vivo while other e2s like ubc <dig> and ubc <dig> may be involved in specific functions like histone modification. the e2-e <dig> specificity analysis performed in this study could offer a potential dataset, which can be helpful for future in vivo analysis.

the use of wheat germ-based protein libraries such as those described here, is not limited to the analysis of gene products but can be used as a platform for several perspective studies. our ring protein library can be used to screen for protein-protein interactions and contribute to the discovery of novel ring e3-substrate relationship in arabidopsis plants. some ring e3s ligases showed significant interaction signals when screened with arabidopsis key regulatory proteins using alphascreen protein-protein interaction screening technology . in the future, modifying the wheat germ extract by removing some endogenous components, such as we <dig> and/or we <dig>  and the possible isolation of intact arabidopsis 26s proteasomes  <cit> , may increase our understanding of the ub proteasome system in arabidopsis. the ease by which the wheat germ system produces proteins with different n-terminal sequences and the absence of 26s proteasomal activity makes the system suitable for systematic analysis of the n-end rule  <cit> . the availability of functionally active protein libraries for e <dig> and ring e3s enzymes is an important step in improving our understanding of e2–e <dig> interactions and specificity. expanding our system to analyse substrate ubiquitination using different e2–e <dig> combinations may also increase our understanding of the various cellular processes that are regulated by ubiquitination.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated the importance of using a eukaryotic and plant-related protein expression system in performing in vitro analysis of arabidopsis e2s and ring e3s. using a combination of the rafl cdna library, the ‘split-primer’ pcr method and the wheat germ cell-free system, we were able to express about 95 and 40 % of the arabidopsis e <dig> and ring-type e <dig> proteomes, respectively. the functional activities of several proteins were assessed in this study for the first time. the protein libraries described here can be used to improve understanding e2-e <dig> specificities and as platforms for identifying new target substrates through protein-protein interaction screening.
