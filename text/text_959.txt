BACKGROUND
to predict the secondary structure of an rna sequence is a classic problem of sequence analysis in bioinformatics. the importance of accurate predictions of secondary structures has increased due to the recent finding of functional non-coding rnas whose functions are closely related to their secondary structures  <cit> . secondary structure prediction also plays an important role in research on viral rnas  <cit> .

there are many tools and algorithms for secondary structure prediction  <cit> . the most popular approach is to predict the minimum free energy  structure by using the zuker algorithm  <cit> . well-known software  employs this approach. from a probabilistic viewpoint, the mfe structure is equivalent to the secondary structure of the maximum likelihood  estimation for the probability distribution of secondary structures given by the mccaskill model  <cit> . it is, however, known that the mfe/ml structure has drawbacks: there are a huge number of suboptimal structures whose free energies are similar to the minimum free energy and the probability of the mfe structure is extremely small  <cit> . moreover, the ml-estimator is not optimized for ac- curacy measures in the target problem  <cit> .

therefore, another approach that considers the entire distribution of possible secondary structures of a given sequence has been introduced. ding et al.  <cit>  proposed the centroid estimator, which minimizes the expected hamming loss. on the other hand, do et al.  <cit>  proposed the maximum expected accuracy  estimator, which gives a prediction based on maximizing the expected value of an accuracy function under a probabilistic distribution of secondary structures. the mea-based estimators have been applied to many problems in bioinformatics, including sequence analyses for rna sequences  <cit> , alignment of bio- logical sequences  <cit>  and other estimation problems  <cit> .

for rna secondary structure predictions, two mea-based estimators have been proposed:  the estimator proposed by  <cit>  and  the γ-centroid estimator proposed by  <cit> . both estimators do not employ the accuracy measures that are used in actual evaluation of rna secondary structure, namely, sensitivity , positive predictive value , matthews correlation coefficient  and f-score, with respect to predicted base-pairs. from a view- point of mea, it is useful to consider the estimators that maximize expectation of those accuracy measures. because the computation of those estimators generally demands huge computational time, the previous studies could not use those accuracy measures directly.

moreover, the previous mea-based estimators contain a parameter that controls the balance between sen and ppv of base-pairs in a predicted secondary structure. it is, however, unclear how to select the parameter in order to obtain one reasonable secondary structure , although there are situations that only one predicted secondary structure is required. there is also a possibility that the optimal parameter might depend on the length of sequence and/or the type of rna family, although the γ-centroid estimator  employs a default parameter, determined by a benchmark dataset, which is identical for all sequences.

in this study, to address the drawbacks of the current mea-based methods described above, we introduce the pseudo-expected accuracy of a secondary structure with respect to a given accuracy measure, which is a function of the number of true positive base-pairs , true-negative base- pairs , false-positive base-pairs  and false- negative base-pairs . the pseudo-expected accuracy is then defined by using expected tp, tn, fp and fn. as the accuracy measures, we utilize sen, ppv, mcc and f-score with respect to base-pairs, which are commonly used in the evaluations of rna secondary structure predictions, because the base- pairs are essential for forming secondary/tertiary structures, which are known to be biologically important.

the pseudo-expected accuracy is easily calculated using the base-pairing probability matrix, and can be computed much more efficiently than the expected accuracy. although the pseudo-expected accuracy is not equal to the expected accuracy of a predicted secondary structure, we found that the pseudo-expected accuracy gives a good approximation of the expected accuracy in our situation. accordingly, we also introduce the approximated estimators that maximize the expected accuracy of a given accuracy measure. moreover, by combining the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score with the γ- centroid estimator, it is possible to predict the balanced secondary structure between sen and ppv , although there is a small computational overhead.

the techniques described in this paper will be extended to design the maximum expected accuracy estimator for various evaluation measures .

methods
in the following, we represent a secondary structure of an rna sequence x as a triangular binary matrix:θ = {θij}i < j where θij =  <dig> means that i-th base xi and j-th base xj form a base-pair, and θij =  <dig> means that i-th base xi and j-th base xj do not form a base-pair. in this study, pseudo-knotted base-pairs are not allowed in a secondary structure. for an rna sequence x,s denotes the space of all the possible secondary structures of x, where |x| is the length of x. a probability distribution on s ) is given by the mccaskill  <cit> , contrafold  <cit>  or simfold  <cit>  models. the base-pairing probability matrix of x, {pi,j}i <j, has entries pij=∑θ∈sip, called base-pairing probabilities, where i is the indicator function that returns  <dig> if the condition is true and  <dig> otherwise. the base-pairing probability matrix of a given rna sequence x can be computed using the mccaskill  algorithm, whose complexities are o and o for time and space, respectively .

expected accuracy and pseudo-expected accuracy of rna secondary structure
accuracy measures for rna secondary structure prediction
for two secondary structures θ = {θij}i < j ∈ s and σ = {σij}i < j ∈ s of an rna sequence x, we define

  tp=tp=∑i <jii, 

  tn=tn=∑i <jii, 

  fp=fp=∑i <jii, 

  fn=fn=∑i <jii, 

  sen=sen=tptp+fn, 

  ppv=ppv=tptp+fp, 

  mcc = mcc=tp·tn−fp·fn, 

  f-score=f-score=2·tp2·tp+fp+fn. 

when θ is a reference  secondary structure and is a predicted secondary structure of x, eqs. , , , , , , , and  are the number of true positive base-pairs, the number of true negative base-pairs, the number of false positive base-pairs, the number of false negative base-pairs, the sen, the ppv, the mcc and the f-score, respectively. because the base-pairs in a secondary structure are biologically important, accuracy measures based on base-pairs are useful and sen, ppv, mcc and f-score are widely-used accuracy measures for secondary structure predictions. note that mcc and f-score are balanced measures between sen and ppv.  in the following, acc means one of the sen, ppv, mcc and f-score.

expected accuracy of secondary structure
given a probability distribution p on s, we calculate the expected values of eq.  to eq. .

  tp^=eθ|x=∑i<jpiji, 

  tn^=eθ|x=|x|2−∑i<ji−∑i<jpij+∑i<jpiji, 

  fp^=eθ|x=∑i<ji, 

  fn^=eθ|x=∑i<jpij), 

where {pij} indicates the base-pairing probability matrix. moreover, we calculate the expected accuracy of an accuracy measure acc  of σ as follows:

  acc^=eθ|x=∑θ∈saccp. 

in order to compute the expected acc for a given secondary structure σ ), it is necessary to sum over all the secondary structures of the rna sequence x because no efficient algorithm  has been reported. the number of candidate secondary structures increases exponentially with the length of the rna sequence , so to compute the expected acc is an intractable problem. therefore, we approximate it using stochastic sampling: for n secondary structures {θ}n=1n given by stochastic sampling  <cit>  of secondary structures, we define

  acc^n=1n∑1≤n≤nacc,σ) 

for σ∈s. acc^n converges to acc^ when n is sufficiently large by the properties of stochastic sampling. it should be noted that the sample size n grows exponentially with the sequence length to acc^n be a reliable approximation to the expected acc of σ.

pseudo-expected accuracy of secondary structure
in our situation, acc is generally written as a function of tp, tn, fp and fn:

acc = f

then, for a secondary structure σ, the pseudo-expected acc of is defined by

  acc^0=f. 

for example, the pseudo-expected mcc is given by

  mcc^0=tp^.tn^−fp^.fn^. 

if we have the base-pairing probability matrix of x, the pseudo-expected acc of σ can be easily computed by using eqs. , ,  and  without employing sampling/enumerating algorithms. although the pseudo-expected acc is not equal to the expected acc, we shall see later that the pseudo-expected acc is a good approximation of the expected acc when acc is equal to sen, ppv, mcc or f-score.

prediction of secondary structure by maximizing pseudo-expected accuracy
the γ-centroid estimator  <cit>  for rna secondary structure prediction is defined by

  σ^=arg maxσ∈s 

where γ > <dig> controls sen and ppv of a predicted secondary structure. this estimator is suitable when we would like to predict more tp and tn and fewer fp and fn because eq.  is equivalent to

  σ^=arg maxσ∈s 

with γ = / and αk ≥  <dig>  hamada et al.  <cit>  show that the secondary structure of the γ-centroid estimator can be calculated by nussinovstyle dynamic programming.

eq.  indicates that the γ-centroid estimator is not optimized for the actual evaluation measures . it is useful to introduce the estimator that maximizes expected sen, ppv, mcc or f-score directly:

  σ^=arg maxσ∈sacc^. 

it is, however, difficult to compute the expected acc efficiently for given σ and p. because acc contains products or divisions of tp, tn, fp and fn, no efficient method to compute the estimator eq.  has been found, in contrast to the γ-centroid estimator of eq. . instead, we consider estimators that maximize pseudo-expected acc as follows.

  σ^=arg maxσ∈sacc^ <dig>  

prediction of secondary structure by maximizing pseudo-expected sen/ppv
the pseudo-expected sen and ppv of a secondary structure σ can be computed by

  sen^0=∑i<jpiji∑i<jpij, 

  ppv^0=∑i<jpiji∑i<ji. 

therefore, the secondary structure given by maximizing pseudo-expected sen  with sen)) is equivalent to the secondary structure that maximizes the sum of base-paring probabilities of the predicted base-pairs. the secondary structure is, therefore, equivalent to the one given by the γ-centroid estimator with a sufficiently large γ  <cit> . on the other hand, the secondary structure given by maximizing pseudo-expected ppv  with ppv)) is equivalent to the secondary structure that consists of  one base-pair that has the highest base-pairing probability.  it should be noted that both structures can be easily computed by using the base-paring probability matrix of the target rna sequence.

prediction of secondary structure by maximizing pseudo-expected mcc/f-score with stochastic sampling 
because of the computational difficulty of computing "argmax" in eq.  with mcc and f-score , we need to evaluate all the secondary structures in s. the number of secondary structures of a given rna sequence, however, is so large that it is not practical to enumerate all of them. therefore, we again employ the stochastic sampling of secondary structures and approximate the estimator of eq.  by

  σ^=argmaxσ∈sacc^ <dig> 

where s is a set of secondary structures given by stochastic sampling. note that the computational cost of this estimator is much smaller than that of predictions based on maximizing the expected mcc/f-score. if the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score gives a good approximation of the expected mcc/f-score and we use a sufficiently large sample size, then the estimator in eq.  should be a reliable approximation to the estimator in eq.  that maximizes the expected mcc/f-score.

prediction of secondary structure with γ-centroid estimator and pseudo-expected mcc/f-score 
in the γ-centroid estimator  <cit>  of eq.  implemented in the software centroidfold  <cit> , there is a parameter γ that adjusts the balance between sen and ppv. it is, however, unclear how to select the γ parameter that achieves a reasonable structure although there are several situations that only one predicted secondary structure is required. as described in the previous section, we can predict the secondary structures that maximize expected sen or ppv, but the well-balanced secondary structure between sen and ppv will be more useful in many cases than those structures.

eq. , which is equivalent in form to the γ- centroid estimator, indicates that the γ-centroid estimator can arbitrarily control the number/ratio of the true predictions and the false predictions by using the parameter. by combining the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score with the γ-centroid estimator, it is possible to predict the balanced secondary structure between sen and ppv, as follows. first, we compute the base-pairing probability matrix of the given rna sequence, and then predict a set of secondary structures sg of x by using the γ-centroid estimators with  <dig> γ parameters: γ ∈ {2k: - <dig> ≤ k ≤  <dig>  k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {6} that were used in our previous paper to obtain the sen-ppv curve  <cit> . here, the secondary structure of the γ-centroid estimator with γ ∈ {2k:  <dig> <k ≤  <dig>  k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {6} is computed by using nussinov-style dynamic programming, but the secondary structure of the γ-centroid estimator with γ ∈ {2k: - <dig> ≤ k ≤  <dig>  k ∈ ℤ} can be predicted without dynamic programming by selecting all the base-pairs whose probability is larger than 1/  <cit> . second, we select the secondary structure in sg that has the best pseudo-expected mcc/f-score:

  σ^= argmaxσ∈sgacc^ <dig>  

where acc is equal to mcc or f-score. the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score of each secondary structure σ ∈ sg is easily computed because the base-pairing probability matrix has already been computed.

in this case, using the γ-centroid estimator is more suitable than using the mea-based estimator proposed by  <cit> , which also has a parameter that controls the balance between sen and ppv, because the latter has a bias to mcc and f-score .

RESULTS
we conducted all experiments using a linux os ma-chine, which has a  <dig> ghz amd opteron model  <dig> processor and  <dig> gb of memory.

experimental settings
for the dataset, we utilized the s-151rfam dataset  <cit>  that contains  <dig> rna sequences with reference structures, each of which was taken from a different family in the rfam database  <cit>  this dataset has been widely used in previous studies of rna secondary structure prediction, for example,  <cit> . for the probability distribution p of the secondary structures of rna sequence x, we used the contrafold model   <cit>  and the mccaskill model  <cit>  . for evaluation measures, we employed sen, ppv, mcc and f-score with respect to the base-pairs, which are defined by eqs. , ,  and , respectively, where σ is a predicted structure and θ is a reference structure.

comparison between pseudo-expected accuracy and expected accuracy
in this experiment, we compared the pseudo-expected acc ) with the expected acc ) where acc is sen, ppv, mcc or f-score. first, we obtained a set of secondary structures from the s-151rfam dataset in the following way. for each rna sequence in the s-151rfam dataset, we predicted the secondary structures using the γ-centroid estimator  <cit>   with  <dig> γ parameters, γ ∈ {2k: - <dig> ≤ k ≤ 10} ∪ {6} and two models . then, duplicate secondary structures were removed from the set. the set of the secondary structures contains various secondary structures, because the γ-centroid estimator with small γ predicts a small number of base-pairs and the one with large γ predicts a large number of base-pairs  <cit> . as described in the previous section, it is not feasible to compute the expected acc ) of a given secondary structure, because the number of possible secondary structures is immense. therefore, we plotted acc^ <dig> ) and acc^1m  samples; eq. ) for each secondary structure σ in the set of secondary structures.

the result is shown in figure  <dig>  which indicates the pseudo-expected sen, ppv, mcc and f-score of the predicted secondary structure is a reliable approximation to the expected sen, ppv, mcc and f-score, respectively. the averaged squared errors of the pseudo-expected sen, ppv, mcc and f-score with respect to the contrafold model and the mccaskill model are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

results of secondary structure prediction by maximizing pseudo-expected accuracy
we conducted the experiments on rna secondary structure prediction by maximizing the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score of the predicted secondary structure with stochastic sampling ). note that the results in the previous section suggest that the estimator of eq.  with a sufficiently large sample size is a good approximation to the estimator of eq.  that maximizes the expected mcc/f-score.

the results are shown in figure  <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> . as the sample size increased, the performance of the prediction of the estimator in eq.  converged to the points on the sen-ppv curves of the γ-centroid estimator  <cit> , and favorable mcc/f-scores were achieved . on the other hand, we need to sample a large number of secondary structures  in order to obtain the secondary structure that has a good mcc/f-score. the computational time of the estimator of eq.  increased linearly with the sample size . the result also suggests that it is difficult to improve the performance of the γ-centroid estimator even if we employ the estimator of eq. , that is, maximizing expected mcc/f-score.

the rows labeled "gc-pmcc" and "gc-pf" indicate rna secondary structure prediction with the γ-centroid estimator and the pseudo-expected mcc and f-score, respectively . the rows below the dashed line indicate the results of the γ-centroid estimator  <cit>  with various values of the γ parameter . note that simfold and sfold employ a similar probabilistic model  for secondary structures to the mccaskill model.

total computational time in seconds for predicting secondary structures of all rna sequences in the s-151rfam dataset. the 1st row indicates the γ-centroid estimator  <cit>  with a fixed γ parameter . the 2nd row indicates the prediction of rna secondary structure with the γ-centroid estimator and pseudo-expected mcc . "max-pmcc " from the 3rd to 6th rows indicate the estimator of eq. , that is, rna secondary structure prediction by maximizing pseudo-expected mcc with stochastic sampling  where n is the number of samples.

it should be noted that the performance of the estimator that maximizes the pseudo-expected sen  corresponds to the leftmost  point in the sen-ppv curve of the γ-centroid estimators.

results of secondary structure prediction with γ- centroid estimator and pseudo-expected accuracy
it is also much better than the performance of rnafold, sfold and simfold, all of which return a single prediction. note that method m <dig> with a fixed probabilistic model  generally achieves performance that differs from that of the γ-centroid estimator with the same model for any γ value. this is because method m <dig> automatically selects the secondary structure with the best pseudo-expected mcc/f-score from a set of secondary structures given by the γ-centroid estimator for  <dig> γ values, while each point in a sen-ppv curve of the γ- centroid estimator comes from a fixed γ-value.

the comparison between the 2nd and 3rd rows in table  <dig> indicates that there is only small overhead for the computation of the estimator of method m <dig>  compared with the γ-centroid estimator with a fixed γ parameter  <cit> . the reasons can be summarized as follows. the cyk-type algorithm of the nussinov-style dynamic programming for computing a consistent rna secondary structure is faster than the inside-outside-type algorithm for computing the base-pairing probability matrix in the γ-centroid estimator, even though both algorithms have the same computational complexity. moreover, we do not need to employ the cyk-type algorithm for the γ- centroid estimator with γ ≤  <dig> because we only select the base-pairs whose base-pairing probability is larger than 1/  <cit> . also, the computation of the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score of a given secondary structure is fast enough when the base-pairing probability matrix is computed beforehand.

in summary, by combining the pseudo-expected accuracy with the γ-centroid estimator, we successfully predict the well-balanced secondary structure between sen and ppv  and the performance  is better than that of rnafold, simfold, sfold and centroidfold.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we introduced the pseudo-expected accuracy,  of a given rna secondary structure under a probability distribution of possible secondary structures. the pseudo-expected accuracy can be computed much more easily than the expected accuracy, because it is computed using the base-pairing probability matrix of the rna sequence. although the pseudo-expected accuracy of a given secondary structure is not equal to the expected accuracy of the structure, our computational experiments have indicated that the pseudo-expected accuracy of a given secondary structure is a good approximation of the expected accuracy of the structure when sen, ppv, mcc and f-score were used as the accuracy mea-sure. this finding is one of the contributions of this study, which has not been reported in previous research.

based on this finding, we introduced the approximate estimator that maximizes the pseudo-expected accuracy of a prediction by stochastic sampling, which achieved favorable accuracy in our computational experiments. although the computational cost of this estimator is much smaller than the estimator that maximizes the expected accuracy, it is still unacceptably slow. therefore, we then proposed the combination of the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score and the γ-centroid estimator, which produces one well-balanced secondary structure with small computational overhead. the computational experiments indicate that this approach achieved the best accuracy among state-of-the-art tools. to employ the γ-centroid estimator in method m <dig> is suitable because the γ-centroid estimator is able to represent a secondary structures with an arbitrary balance between the expected tp, tn, fp and fn by adjusting the parameter γ ). this, however, does not prove that there always exists a γ such that the γ-centroid estimator achieves the best pseudo-expected mcc or f-score. note that the combination of the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score with the mea-based estimator proposed by  <cit>  is not suitable because the estimator has a bias to mcc and f-score, compared to the γ-centroid estimator  <cit> .

although the trade-ff between sen and ppv is inherent, and mcc or f-score is not always the best choice of quality measure for predicted secondary structures, the proposed method  can be applicable when only a single structure is required. the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score is also employed as a ranking measure of several predicted secondary structures.

remarks about terminology: "maximum expected accuracy"
as we described in the introduction section, the term "maximum  expected accuracy"  has been used in a number of previous studies  <cit>  as well as this study. from a mathematical viewpoint, the mea  is a  estimator described as follows. given a predictive space y that contains all the possible candidate solutions of the target problem, a function acc for θ ∈ y and y ∈ y , and a probability distribution p on y given data d, then the estimator

  y^=argmaxy∈y∫accpdθ 

is introduced. when this estimator is called a "maximum expected accuracy"  estimator, acc is equal to an accuracy measure  for a reference θ and a prediction y. this also implies that p is considered to be a probability distribution of references, which is misleading because p does not usually represent the distribution. in rna secondary structure prediction, for example, the mccaskill model provides not a probability distribution of reference secondary structures but rather a full ensemble of possible secondary structures  <cit> .

the estimator of eq.  with a well-designed function acc according to accuracy measures for a target problem and a probability distribution p of solutions empirically achieves better performance than other estimators such as the maximum likelihood estimator and the centroid estimator  in rna secondary structure predictions  <cit>  and in alignments for biological sequences  <cit> .

difficulty of computing eq.  with mcc and f-score
eq.  with mcc and f-score can be rewritten as

  y^=argmaxσ∈s∑i<jpiji∑i<ji and 

  y^=argmaxσ∈s2×∑i<jpiji∑i<ji+∑i<jpij, 

respectively. note that eq.  is an approximation of eq.  with mcc since tn  is much larger than the others in rna secondary structure predictions.

the denominators in both equations prevent division of this optimization problem into sub-problems, which is required to design a dynamic programming algorithm, and hence no efficient algorithms to compute eqs.  and  have yet been devised. note that the "argmax" operation for only the numerator can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming  <cit> .  algorithm for computing eq.  with mcc and f-score.)

the proposed methods are extendable to other situations
we are able to introduce the pseudo-expected ac-curacy for common secondary structure prediction of multiple alignments of rna sequences, because there are several probability distributions for the common secondary structures, for example, the rnaalifold model  <cit>  and the pfold model  <cit> . also, the γ-centroid estimator can be extended to common secondary structure prediction  <cit> , and the pseudo-expected mcc/f-score combined with the estimator is useful to predict the common secondary structure that balances between sen and ppv .

recently, lu et al.  <cit>  proposed the relaxed sen, ppv and mcc, where slippage of base-pair is al-lowed in computing those measures. it is possible to design the γ-centroid-type estimator that fits with those measures and also to introduce pseudo-expected accuracy of those measures. moreover, the methods used in this paper can be extended to more general types of estimation problems  with various accuracy measures that are defined by using tp, tn, fp and fn .

the method presented in this paper can be applied to local alignments for biological sequences be-cause the γ-centroid estimator was also introduced in the problem  <cit> . in contrast to global alignment problems, the balance between sen and ppv with respect to aligned bases is important in local alignment problems.
