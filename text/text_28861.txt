BACKGROUND
chromatin provides a platform to regulate gene expression during several biological processes such as cellular differentiation events. epigenetic programs involve dna methylation patterns and/or stable modifications of histone tails  <cit> . most if not all chromatin proteins associating with nucleosomal chromatin bind only transiently and are part of dynamic networks that regulate chromatin organization and function. high mobility group  proteins are members of these dynamic networks  <cit> . all members of the three hmg-families are considered as architectural chromatin proteins. nevertheless, each family or even each family member play distinct roles in chromatin function  <cit> .

the mammalian hmga family consists of four members. alternative splicing of the hmga <dig> transcript gives rise to three variants, hmga1a, 1b, and 1c while hmga <dig> is encoded by a separate gene. proteins of the hmga family are characterized by conserved dna-binding domains, the at-hooks, and an acidic c-terminal tail  <cit> . hmga proteins bind to at-rich dna which is considered to be the major reason for their concentration in heterochromatin  <cit> . hmga proteins affect the expression of many genes through architectural remodeling of the chromatin structure and by stabilizing nucleoprotein complexes called enhanceosomes built on promoter/enhancer regions  <cit> . in addition, hmga proteins are part of further chromatin complexes, as has been shown for the pre-replication complex  <cit>  and are able to influence the structure and function of large chromatin domains  <cit> .

during development hmga proteins are highly expressed in early embryos and undifferentiated cells but are absent in differentiated cells  <cit> . thus, a regulated hmga expression is important for proper cell function and differentiation. high expression levels are found in many tumors and correlate with tumor malignancy  <cit> , are linked to deregulated oncogenes and contribute to genomic instability by inhibition of proper nucleotide excision repair  <cit> . several reports indicated that hmga proteins influence expression of genes in a cell type specific manner  <cit> .

loss of hmga <dig> or hmga <dig> gene function affects specific differentiation processes  <cit> . hmga <dig> knockout mice develop type  <dig> diabetes due to a reduced expression of the insulin receptor  <cit> , cardiac hypertrophy and myelo-lymphoproliferative disorders  <cit> . hmga <dig> was shown to be crucial for cardiogenesis through regulating the gene nkx <dig> , a cardiogenic key transcription factor  <cit> . a pygmy phenotype of mice is caused by a disrupted hmga <dig> gene and characterized by drastic reduction of fat tissue and a deficient spermatogenesis  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate that after induction of myogenesis in c2c <dig> cells down-regulation of hmga <dig> proteins is an early and required step allowing the progression of the myogenic program. sustained hmga1a expression prevented myogenic differentiation and altered the chromatin composition through interfering with the expression of myogenic genes and other architectural chromatin proteins.

RESULTS
down-regulation of hmga <dig> proteins during cellular differentiation
murine c2c <dig> cells are committed cells that initiate muscle differentiation upon growth factor withdrawal or initiate osteogenesis upon addition of the growth factor bmp <dig>  after induction of the myogenic program major morphological changes in c2c <dig> cells occurred on day 1- <dig>  and on days 6- <dig> . analyses of hmga <dig> expression by rt-pcr and western blots revealed an immediate down-regulation of hmga <dig> expression after induction of myogenic differentiation reaching low or undetectable levels on day  <dig> and subsequent time points during differentiation, respectively . similarly, induction of osteogenesis by bmp <dig> also caused down-regulation of hmga <dig> mrna with a delayed onset compared to the down-regulation during myogenesis. interestingly, hmga <dig> protein levels remained well detectable even after  <dig> days of osteogenic differentiation . the persistence of hmga <dig> protein compared to the absence of detectable mrna might result from different protein stabilities dependent on the cellular context during the two differentiation pathways. these data support that hmga <dig> expression is only prominent in undifferentiated cells but down-regulated after the initiation of differentiation upon external stimuli.

characterization of c2c <dig> cells stably expressing hmga1a-egfp
to assess whether hmga <dig> down-regulation is required for cell differentiation we generated c2c <dig> cells stably over-expressing hmga1a-egfp . as previously shown, hmga1a-egfp fusion proteins behave like endogenous proteins  <cit> . hmga1a-egfp expression was constant throughout the entire time the c2a1a cells were cultured under myogenic induction conditions . western blots revealed that the over-expression of exogenous hmga1a-egfp in c2a1a cells resulted in a prolonged expression of endogenous hmga <dig>  the latter was still detectable six days after culturing c2a1a cells in differentiation medium while hmga <dig> was undetectable in c2c <dig> wild type cells already  <dig> days after induction. endogenous hmga <dig> and exogenous hmga1-egfp were detected in parallel by an hmga1-specific antibody to compare relative expression levels . semi-quantitative densitometric evaluation of western blots using imagej indicated a ~ <dig> -fold over-expression of hmga <dig> proteins as compared to endogenous hmga <dig> in wild type myoblasts.

in living c2a1a cells, hmga1a-egfp preferentially localized throughout the cell cycle in heterochromatin foci which represent pericentromeric regions fused into larger entities called chromocenters . in interphase cells it colocalized with markers for heterochromatin such as hp1α, histone h <dig> trimethylated at k <dig> or histone h <dig> trimethylated at k <dig> . in agreement with previous data that linked increased hmga levels to enhanced cell proliferation, we counted a  <dig> -fold increase in the c2a1a cell number  <dig> hours after seeding the same amount of c2c <dig> and c2a1a cells. facs analyses revealed a similar cell cycle stage distribution of the transformed and parental cells .

stable expression of hmga1a prevents myogenic differentiation of c2c <dig> cells
to compare myogenesis in c2c <dig> and c2a1a cells we used immunolocalization experiments as well as rt-pcr. immunofluorescence indicated that c2a1a cells, but not c2c <dig> cells, failed to fuse and to form myosin positive myotubes . we further tested the expression of α-actin and myosin light chain mrna as a marker for myogenic differentiation. in c2c <dig> cells, transcripts of both markers were detectable by rt-pcr shortly after induction of differentiation . in contrast, they were absent in c2a1a cells grown for at least  <dig> days in differentiation medium . on the contrary, as monitored by expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, early osteogenesis was not affected . together these data demonstrate that sustained expression of hmga1a does not interfere with early osteogenic events but specifically impairs myogenesis in c2c <dig> cells.

sustained hmga1a expression prevents chromocenter remodeling
reorganization of chromatin accompanies cellular differentiation. in c2c <dig> cells, differentiation associated chromatin reorganization is visual as clustering of chromocenters during terminal differentiation leading to a reduced chromocenter number in differentiated cells  <cit> . to examine whether variations in hmga <dig> levels participate in chromocenter remodeling we compared their numbers in c2c <dig> cells, c2a1a cells  and c2a1a cells after hmga <dig> knock-down through sirna . successful knock-down of endogenous hmga <dig> and hmga1a-egfp was verified by loss of egfp-fluorescence  and by western blot analyses . number and distribution of chromocenters were found to be almost identical in non-induced c2c12- and c2a1a-myoblasts . consistent with brero et al.,  <cit> , reduced chromocenter numbers indicated chromocenter clustering in terminally differentiated c2c <dig> cells . in contrast, even after growing c2a1a cells for  <dig> days in differentiation medium, the number of chromocenters remained comparable to the number of chromocenters in non-induced cells or even shifted to an increased percentage of cells with increased chromocenter number . thus, hmga <dig> over-expression prevented chromocenter clustering which occurs normally through terminal differentiation and stabilized a chromocenter distribution comparable to non-induced myoblasts.

we further asked, what happens to the chromocenter organization after hmga1a knock-down. therefore, we evaluated the chromocenter number in c2a1a myoblasts that lost their egfp fluorescence as a marker for hmga <dig> knock-down after hoechst staining . of note, the fraction of cell nuclei with more than  <dig> chromocenters significantly increased from  <dig> % to 42% in cells without egfp fluorescence . this suggests that reduced hmga <dig> protein level in non-induced c2c <dig> cells lead to a reduced chromocenter stability. it should be noted that chromocenter dissociation was observed transiently between 12- <dig> hours after hmga <dig> knock-down through sirna treatment . comparable chromocenter dissociation was observed in c2c <dig> cells around day  <dig> of differentiation when endogenous hmga <dig> is down-regulated  indicating that transient chromocenter dissociation naturally and transiently occurs prior to chromocenter clustering. together this suggests that hmga1a over-expression stabilizes chromocenters and prevents their remodeling prior to clustering during terminal differentiation.

hmga <dig> over-expression alters global chromatin composition
hmg proteins have been shown to globally affect chromatin organization and function as players in dynamic networks through regulating the access of other factors and modulators to chromatin  <cit> . little is known about how hmg proteins affect chromatin composition through affecting expression of other architectural chromatin proteins. we therefore examined by western blotting how over-expression of hmga1a influences the expression of hmgb <dig>  hmgn <dig> and histone h <dig> during cellular differentiation . the expression levels of hmgb <dig> and hmgn <dig> were different in c2c <dig> and c2a1a cells, displaying a slight down-regulation especially at day  <dig> after induction of c2a1a cells. notably, histone h <dig> levels were constantly decreased in c2a1a cells before and throughout induction of myogenesis. in contrast, histone h <dig> levels remained unaffected after hmga1a knock-down in uninduced c2c <dig> cells . this suggests that the effect on histone h <dig> expression only occurs when hmga1a is over-expressed in c2a1a cells and that the down-regulation of histone h <dig> may be an indirect effect.

during differentiation of c2c <dig> cells the heterochromatin associated methyl-cpg-binding protein mecp <dig> is highly expressed only during terminal differentiation and involved in chromocenter clustering  <cit> . in contrast to hmga <dig>  over-expression of mecp <dig> is sufficient to cause chromocenter clustering even in the absence of differentiation  <cit> . therefore, we examined mecp <dig> expression in more detail. consistent with brero et al.  <cit>  we found that mecp <dig> expression in c2c <dig> cells started at day  <dig> of differentiation  and only a minor fraction of mecp <dig> was localized in chromocenters of myoblasts . on day  <dig> of differentiation mecp <dig> was concentrated in fused chromocenters in c2c <dig> cells .

in contrast, we detected a premature expression of mecp <dig> in c2a1a cells  and mecp <dig> was already accumulated in chromocenters of c2a1a myoblasts . nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, chromocenter clustering was prevented in c2a1a cells . thus, hmga1a over-expression elevates the expression of mecp <dig> but also counteracts its capability to cause heterochromatin fusion.

together, these data demonstrate that changes in hmga1a levels cause an alteration of the expression of architectural chromatin proteins and are therefore able to modulate global chromatin composition on the level of gene expression.

hmga1a over-expression deregulates myogenic gene expression
to examine whether the impaired myogenesis of c2a1a cells could be due to altered expression of myogenic factors we analyzed  the expression profiles of the transcription factors myogenic factor  <dig> and  <dig> , myocyte enhancer factor 2a , the myogenic determination gene  <dig> , myogenin and the myogenic inhibitor homeobox, msh-like  <dig>  . compared to c2c <dig> cells, the expression of myod and myogenin was significantly suppressed in c2a1a cells. mef2a seemed to be only slightly down-regulated. in contrast, the myogenic inhibitor msx <dig> was up-regulated. the expression profiles of other factors involved in myogenic differentiation like myf <dig> and myf <dig>  remained unaffected by sustained hmga1a expression.

besides transcription factors, growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor  <dig> and  <dig>  are required for proper myogenesis. igf binding proteins  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  further fine tune the bioavailability of igf <dig> and igf <dig>  rt-pcr analyses revealed that igf <dig>  igf <dig>  igfbp <dig> and igfbp <dig> were down-regulated in c2a1a cells after induction, indicating that hmga1a that is present after induction is able to suppress the expression of components of the igf-system .

these data illustrate that a sustained high hmga1a protein level after induction of myogenesis alters the expression of specific genes crucial for myogenesis and prevents to establish a proper myogenic gene expression profile.

knock-down of hmga <dig> in hmga1a over-expressing cells is sufficient to re-initiate myogenic differentiation
we performed sirna experiments to examine whether hmga <dig> knock-down would restore the ability of c2a1a cells to undergo myogenic differentiation. notably, in c2c <dig> and c2a1a cells, hmga <dig> knock-down through sirna was not sufficient to initiate the myogenic program and still required induction by serum withdrawal . however, sirna mediated knock-down of hmga1a in c2a1a cells was sufficient to reactivate the potential of c2a1a cells to enter the myogenic program after induction. rt-pcr revealed regained expression of myod, myogenin, myosin lc and α-actin on day  <dig> after induction . these data demonstrate that down-regulation of hmga1a is a crucial pre-requisite for the initiation of the myogenic program after induction and necessary to enable c2c <dig> cells to establish a specific gene expression profile that is essential for the correct course of myogenic differentiation. furthermore, knock-down of hmga1a in c2a1a cells restored myosin expression 3- <dig> days after induction as well as chromocenter clustering accompanying terminal differentiation . this supports that hmga1a down-regulation is crucial to activate the entire myogenic program including chromatin remodeling during terminal differentiation.

discussion
hmga <dig> proteins are architectural chromatin proteins known to be preferentially expressed in proliferating embryonic tissues but absent in differentiated cells  <cit> . hmga <dig> proteins have been previously implicated in the differentiation of several cell types. for example hmga <dig> affects lympho-hematopoietic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and the differentiation of sperm cells  <cit> . hmga <dig> proteins bind to adipocyte-specific promoters and down-regulation has been shown to impair adipocytic differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit> . here we demonstrate that hmga <dig> down-regulation is one of the first and essential steps to allow myogenic differentiation of c2c <dig> cells. in contrast, sustained expression of hmga1a-egfp after induction prevents myogenic differentiation. mechanistically, the inhibition of c2c <dig> myogenesis is caused by a specific down-regulation of the myogenic key transcription factors myod and myogenin and several additional factors that are required to progress myogenesis.

several mechanisms have been described on how hmga proteins participate in specific gene expression, for example the formation of enhanceosomes  <cit> , binding to specific promoter regions to remove inhibitory factors and to recruit chromatin remodeling complexes or to interact with other transcription factors   <cit> .

the genes that are specifically targeted by hmga1a during c2c <dig> myogenesis remain to be examined. certainly, the down-regulation of specific myogenic genes through hmga1a is indirect and may represent downstream effects in myogenic gene activation cascades. for example, the decreased myogenin expression is likely caused by the down-regulation of myod as well as mef2a. the latter was recently shown to be necessary for efficient expression of myogenin through the binding to its promoter  <cit> . myod in turn might be repressed through up-regulation of its suppressor msx <dig>  even though elevated msx <dig> expression in c2a1a cells was just prominent until three days after induction, this initial up-regulation might be sufficient to aggravate the effects of inhibition on the myogenic program. in contrast, it is also conceivable that the differential expression of these genes observed in c2a1a cells is regulated by hmga <dig> independently of each other, while affecting the differentiation program in a synergistic manner. due to this possibility, the promoters of myod, myogenin as well as msx <dig> are good potential candidates for being direct hmga1a targets. other direct candidate genes are those of the igf-pathway which we found to be suppressed through sustained hmga1a expression . several previous reports discussed that igf-signaling is involved in sugar metabolism  <cit>  and myogenic differentiation  <cit>  and igf <dig> depletion impairs functional muscle development in mice  <cit> . supporting that, igf <dig> induces myogenin expression followed by cell cycle arrest and myogenic differentiation  <cit> . depletion of igf <dig> in c <dig> cells inhibits myod expression and abolishes the ability of the cells to express myogenin and myosin genes  <cit> . thus, the observed deregulation of the igf-signaling through hmga1a over-expression may cause and/or amplify the lack of key myogenic transcription factors and is in good correlation to our observed inhibition of myogenesis.

despite specific effects on gene promoters, sustained hmga1a expression may also affect gene regulation through a more global regulation of chromatin architecture. for example, it has been shown that hmga <dig> binds to a/t-rich scaffold attachment regions  which are thought to organize larger chromatin domains  <cit> . previous reports showed that hmga proteins are preferentially associated with heterochromatin  <cit> . this is supported by the preferential localization of hmga1a in chromocenters of c2c <dig> cells.

hmg proteins, histone h <dig> and many other chromatin proteins are members of a large network of chromatin binding factors that dynamically modulate chromatin architecture through interaction and competition  <cit> . the function of this network also depends on the availability of hmga1-interactors and competitors such as histone h <dig>  <cit> . hmga <dig> proteins were found to induce transcription of previously suppressed plasmid templates by displacement of histone h <dig> from sar elements  <cit> . in support, it was shown that hmg proteins in general compete for chromatin binding with histone h <dig> in living cells  <cit> . the significantly decreased levels of histone h <dig> in hmga1a over-expressing c2c <dig> cells demonstrate a shift in the regulatory equilibrium of those two chromatin proteins, favoring hmga <dig> binding to previously h1-suppressed sites. this could lead to the modulation of the structure and activity of large chromatin loops and thus affect myogenic gene expression.

the massive down-regulation of histone h <dig> was surprising. this raises the question how the cells could tolerate this. however, besides histone h <dig> additional chromatin proteins such as hmgb <dig>  hmgn <dig> and mecp <dig> were also misregulated. this indicates that the entire chromatin composition is altered and that the loss of histone h <dig> may be compensated by other chromatin proteins like hmgb <dig>  <cit>  or other differentiation specific histone h <dig> variants which are not detected by the h <dig> antibodies used. within this context it is important that the over-expression of hmga1a-egfp prevented chromocenter remodeling and thus global chromatin reorganization normally accompanying differentiation. interestingly, remodeling of chromocenters was completely recovered after knock-down of hmga1a in c2a1a cells which was visual through regained chromocenter clustering during the restored terminal differentiation. notably, the protein mecp <dig>  which stabilizes chromocenter organization in differentiated cells, was up-regulated in c2a1a cells. mecp <dig> dynamically interplays with hp <dig> proteins, and it was suggested that this interaction in turn stabilizes chromatin organization  <cit> . consistently, premature mecp <dig> expression in hmga1a over-expressing c2a1a cells could therefore increase and stabilize the hp <dig> concentration on chromatin which in turn could stabilize a chromatin structure that prevents expression of genes relevant for myogenic differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that down-regulation of hmga <dig> chromatin proteins is crucial to initiate the myogenic program after induction of c2c <dig> differentiation. thus, we provide an example how differential expression of hmga <dig> proteins is involved in differentiation processes. after induction, sustained hmga1a expression alters the transcription of genes that are relevant for initiation and the proper course of myogenic differentiation. both, specific gene regulation and global effects on chromatin may contribute to this deregulated gene expression. global effects involve deregulated expression of other chromatin proteins such as histone h <dig> and mecp <dig>  leading to a modified chromatin composition. more generally, these latter data propose that altered levels of hmga <dig> proteins are connected to the expression of architectural chromatin proteins and thus are able to establish a specific chromatin composition.

this report contributes to the understanding of how the differential expression of hmga <dig> proteins is involved in chromatin organization in undifferentiated cells and during differentiation processes. furthermore, it may help to comprehend possible mechanisms of hmga function in malign and benign tumours that over-express hmga proteins.
