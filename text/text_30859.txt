BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is a commensal of the moist squamous epithelium of the human anterior nares  <cit> . it is also an opportunistic pathogen that can cause conditions ranging from superficial skin infections to serious invasive diseases such as septicaemia, infective endocarditis and septic arthritis  <cit> .

s. aureus can express an array of surface proteins that mediate bacterial binding to plasma proteins and constituents of the extracellular matrix  <cit> , which promote colonization of diverse anatomical sites and contribute to virulence. many strains can express two distinct fibronectin-binding proteins  which are encoded by the two closely linked genes fnba and fnbb  <cit> . however some strains only contain a single gene encoding fnbpa  <cit> . fnbpa can specifically bind to fibronectin, fibrinogen and elastin  <cit> . fnbpa mediates internalization of s. aureus into epithelial and endothelial cells  <cit> , promotes rapid aggregation of human platelets  <cit> , and is a virulence factor in experimental endocarditis and septic arthritis infection studies  <cit> .

previous work in our group has focused on the binding of the fnbpa n-terminal a domain to fibrinogen and elastin  <cit> . the a domain is predicted to comprise three separately folded sub-domains n <dig>  n <dig>  and n <dig>  similar to the fibrinogen-binding a domains of s. aureus clfa and staphylococcus epidermidis sdrg  <cit> . the x-ray crystal structure of the n <dig> sub-domains of clfa and sdrg have been solved in their apo forms and show striking similarities to each other, despite the fact that they are only ~20% identical at the amino acid level  <cit> . sub-domains n <dig> and n <dig> are independently folded in a novel type of immunoglobulin fold . the n <dig> and n <dig> domains of sdrg are separated by a hydrophobic trench, which binds the fibrinogen β-chain peptide  <cit> . in silico docking studies and mutagenesis revealed that the trench separating n <dig> and n <dig> in clfa is the binding site for the c-terminal fibrinogen γ-chain peptide  <cit> . a structural model of the fnbpa a domain has a very similar conformation to the solved structures of sdrg and clfa, including the hydrophobic trench  <cit> . residues lining this trench are crucial in binding of the fnbpa to both fibrinogen and elastin  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated that the fnbpa a domain from strain p <dig> differs substantially from 8325- <dig> fnbpa, sharing only  <dig> % identical amino acids. this was sufficient to create differences in surface-exposed epitopes which affected immuno-crossreactivity, while ligand binding activity was conserved  <cit> . this study aimed to study a well-characterized strain collection of human origin  <cit> , and human isolates where genomes have been fully sequenced. five novel fnbpa a domain isotypes were discovered. many of the isotypes were distributed widely amongst s.aureus strains of different mlst genotypes indicating horizontal transfer. each isotype bound to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin with similar apparent affinities. polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the isotype i fnbpa a domain showed reduced binding to other isotypes demonstrating differences in surface exposed epitopes between isotypes.

RESULTS
fnba gene variation in s. aureus whole-genome sequences
we previously reported that a portion of the fnba gene encoding the fibrinogen and elastin-binding a domain  varied substantially in strain p <dig> compared to the archetypal fnba gene of strain 8325- <dig>  <cit> , resulting in fnbpa a domains which were  <dig> % identical in amino acid sequence. amino acid substitutions were non-randomly distributed resulting in sub-domain n <dig> being the most conserved , while sub-domains n <dig> and n <dig> were more divergent .

fnbpa a domain sequences from published s. aureus genome sequences  were analysed to determine if any further variation within the a domain was apparent. amino acid sequences were aligned in pairwise combinations and the identities calculated. strains col, usa <dig> and 8325- <dig> contained highly similar fnbpa a domains . this fnbpa a domain is classified as isotype i. these three strains belong to mlst clonal complex  <dig>   <cit> , indicating a close phylogenetic relationship. strain mrsa <dig> , which belongs to the cc30/ <dig> clonal complex  <cit> , encoded an fnbpa a domain that was divergent from isotype i  and is here called isotype ii. two cc- <dig> strains  contained fnba genes specifying identical a domains, but shared only  <dig> % and  <dig> % residue identity with isotypes i and ii respectively, and are here called isotype iii. cc- <dig> strains  specified identical a domains that were very similar  to the isotype iii a domains of st- <dig> strains. variation between the a domains of st- <dig> and st- <dig> strains was confined to the n <dig> sub-domains, while the n <dig> sub-domains were 100% identical. the classification of fnbpa a domains used in this study  is based on the minimal ligand-binding n <dig> sub-domains, and therefore the st- <dig> and st- <dig> fnbpa a domains are classed as isotype iii.

the fnbpa a domain from s. aureus strain p <dig> , which we analyzed previously  <cit> , was divergent from isotypes i, ii and iii and is called isotype iv. the divergent n <dig> sub-domains of isotypes i – iv share between  <dig>  and  <dig> % identity in any pairwise alignment . the n <dig> sub-domains are more conserved, with average identities of  <dig> % between different isotypes. the c-terminal fibronectin-binding motifs  <dig> –  <dig> of fnbpa isotypes i – iii were highly conserved in the genome sequences indicating that fnbpa a domains alone, in particular the n <dig> sub-domains, are subject to variation.

variation of fnbpa a domains in carriage and clinical s. aureus strains
a collection of s. aureus strains isolated from carriers and invasive disease patients has previously been analyzed by mlst  <cit> . eleven strains representing major clonal complexes , minor groups , and singletons  were analyzed. gene fragments encoding the entire a domain plus some flanking sequence were amplified from genomic dna by pcr with flanking primers , cloned and sequenced. the deduced a domain amino acid sequences indicated that  <dig> out of  <dig> strains encoded n <dig> sub-domains that are very similar to one of isotypes i – iv described above. strains from st- <dig> and st- <dig> encoded isotype i . strains from st- <dig>  st- <dig>  and st- <dig> specfied isotype ii . st- <dig>  st- <dig>  and st- <dig> strains specified isotype iii . st- <dig> and st- <dig> strains specified isotype iv  . a novel fnbpa n <dig> sub-domain sequence was found in s. aureus strain  <dig>  which was between  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical to a domain isoypes i – iv  and is here called isotype v.

* pairwise alignments were performed using the amino acid sequences of the n <dig> sub-domains of the fnbpa a domain. sequences used in the alignments were from the following s. aureus strains: isotype i – 8325-4; isotype ii – mrsa252; isotype iii – mssa476; isotype iv – p1; isotype v – 3110; isotype vi – 19; isotype vii –  <dig> 

dna hybridization analysis using fnba isotype-specific probes
to determine the distribution of fnbpa a domain isotypes i – v in s. aureus strains of different mlst genotypes we used dna hybridization with isotype-specific probes homologous to a portion of the highly divergent n <dig> sub-domain. dna encoding the entire a domain was amplified from strains to be typed . pcr products were spotted onto membranes and hybridized with the dig-labelled type-specific probes. an example of a hybridization experiment is shown in figure  <dig>  the probes were shown to be type-specific as each probe only hybridized to the appropriate control fnba fragment . this allowed for rapid typing of multiple strains without the requirement for sequencing. in the example shown, fnba gene fragments of any given strain only hybridized with one probe . the hybridization data for a domain typing of strains is summarized in table  <dig> 

fnba dna from s. aureus strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  did not hybridize with any probe , indicating that they express a novel fnbpa isotype. the fnba gene fragments from these two strains were cloned and sequenced, and the deduced a domain protein sequences were compared to the sequences of a domains types i – v. the a domain of s. aureus strain  <dig>  was novel and is called isotype vi . it was very similar  to the fnbpa a domain of bovine strain rf <dig> , the genome sequence of which is available. the a domain of strain  <dig>  was also novel, and is called isotype vii ). isotype vii of strain  <dig> is similar  to the a domain present in an st- <dig> strain  <cit> .

distribution of fnbpa isotypes i – vii in strains of different mlst types
the n <dig> sub-domain of fnbpa is highly conserved , while sub-domains n <dig> and n <dig> are more divergent . neighbour joining  trees based on dna sequences of the fnba allelic variants demonstrate n <dig> and n <dig> sequences appear to have co-evolved. for example, strains of st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig> and st- <dig> have fnba genes encoding isotype ii a domains that are greater than 97% identical. in the fnba n <dig> nj tree  and the fnba n <dig> nj tree  sequences from these strains clustered together. similarly, strains carrying isotype i , isotype iii , isotype type iv , or isotype vi  clustered similarly according to n <dig> and n <dig> fnba sequence . therefore n <dig> and n <dig> sub-domains are always associated in a single combination, which is likely to conserve ligand binding functions. for this reason, we have defined isotypes based on the highly variable n <dig> sub-domain amino acid sequences.

the n <dig> sub-domain sequences appear to have evolved in distinct manner from the n <dig> sub-domain sequences . for example, isotype iii  a domains of mssa <dig>  and n <dig>  are 100% identical, while their n <dig> sub-domains have only  <dig> % identity. the dna sequences encoding n <dig> sub-domains are generally highly conserved, reflected by the low number of substitutions per site , and their phylogeny does not appear to match that of the n <dig> or n <dig> sub-domain encoding sequences , indicating a different pattern of evolution not related to ligand binding activity. it should be noted that in strains of the same st , or strains within the same clonal complex  and st- <dig>  from cc8) the entire a domains  are very highly conserved.

location of variant amino acid residues on molecular models of the fnbpa a domain
the fnbpa a domain of s. aureus 8325- <dig> has a similar organization to the fibrinogen-binding a domain of s. aureus clfa, the x-ray crystal structure of which has been solved  <cit> . a 3d model of the isotype i a domain of fnbpa closely resembles the clfa structure  <cit> . variant residues between isotypes i and iv were predicted to be mostly exposed on the surface of the protein model  <cit> . a similar analysis was performed here which showed that the variant residues of isotypes ii, iii, v, vi and vii were predicted to be exposed on the a domain surface . residues that were identified by mutagenesis as important in fibrinogen and elastin binding by the type i a domain  <cit>  were highly conserved across all isotypes. structural models of isotypes ii – vii were generated using the web based phyre program  based on the crystal structure of clfa. each showed striking similarities to the isotype i model  <cit>  .

binding of fnbpa a domains isotypes i – vii to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin
the minimum ligand binding n <dig> sub-domains of isotype i and isotype iv were studied previously  <cit> . here the n <dig> sub-domains of isotypes ii, iii, v, vi and vii were also expressed. each isotype bound to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner . the apparent affinity of each isotype for fibrinogen was very similar with a half maximum binding concentration of ca.  <dig> nm . the isotype i a domain bound elastin with a half maximum of  <dig> nm whereas isotypes ii – vii had a higher affinity with a half maximum at  <dig> –  <dig> nm . this is consistent with the previous report for isotype i and iv  <cit> . the conservation of binding activity across all isotypes indicates that ligand binding by the fnbpa a domain is biologically important for s. aureus.

binding of antibodies to isotypes i – vii
the majority of variant residues between different a domain types were predicted to be exposed on the surface. this might create differences in surface-exposed epitopes that affect antigenicity. we previously demonstrated that polyclonal antibodies raised against isotype i reacted less efficiently with isotype iv by western immunoblotting  <cit> . here the ability of polyclonal anti-isotype i antibodies to bind different isotypes was measured by elisa. each protein coated the microtitre wells with equal efficiency when detected with anti-hexahistidine monoclonal antibody 7e <dig> . rabbit anti-isotype i antibodies had a  <dig> –  <dig> fold lower affinity for isotypes ii – vii compared to isotype i . thus amino acid variation creates differences in surface-exposed epitopes on the a domain molecule that affect immuno-crossreactivity.

several mouse monoclonal antibodies  directed against isotype i were tested by elisa for binding to each isotype. antibodies 7c <dig> and 1e <dig> bound efficiently to isotype i but showed little binding to isotypes ii – vii  indicating that the 7c <dig> and 1e <dig> epitope is only present on isotype i. similarly, monoclonal antibody 7b <dig> reacted strongly with isotype i, but bound poorly to isotypes ii – vii  indicating that only part of the 7b <dig> epitope is present on a domains ii – vii. 1f <dig> and 1g <dig> had a high affinty for isotypes i, iii, iv, v and vi and a lower affinity for isotype ii and vii  indicating that they recognise a relatively conserved epitope which is partially absent in isotypes ii and vii. it is possible that the if <dig> and 1g <dig> bind the same or overlapping epitopes.

we previously reported that monclonal antibodies 7c <dig>  1e <dig>  1f <dig> and 1g <dig> failed to bind to isotype iv by western blotting and that they bound weakly to isotype i  <cit> . 1e <dig> and 7c <dig> did not react with the isotype iv protein by elisa while 1f <dig> and 1g <dig> reacted well . this discrepancy may be explained by inefficient refolding after denaturation in western immunoblotting.

discussion
we have reported on the substantial sequence diversity in fnba genes amongst s. aureus isolates giving rise to  <dig> isoforms of the fnbpa a domain, which are between  <dig>  and  <dig> % divergent in amino acid sequence. there was strong conservation of residues known to be involved in ligand binding by isotype i, which were predicted to line the putative ligand-binding trench in a 3d structural model  <cit> . this conservation is consistent with the ability of each isotype to bind immobilized fibrinogen and elastin with similar affinities. ligand-binding by the fnbpa a domain is therefore likely to be biologically important to s. aureus in vivo.

the variant residues between isotypes were mapped on the 3d-structural model of the a domain, and the vast majority were predicted to be surface exposed. antibody binding experiments were performed to demonstrate that variation between isotypes affected their antigenicity. polyclonal antibodies against isotype i had reduced affinity for isotypes ii – vii. some monoclonal antibodies raised against isotype i had little or no affinity for all other isotypes, while others reacted well with some isotypes and not others. sequence variation has therefore created differences in epitopes between different fnbpa a domain isotypes.

fnbpa has been documented as an important virulence factor of s. aureus, contributing to experimental endocarditis and septic arthritis infections  <cit> . carriage of the fnba gene by s. aureus was found to be significantly more common in invasive isolates compared to carriage isolates  <cit> , suggesting a role in pathogenicity. studies on the immune responses of individuals exposed to invasive s. aureus infections have shown that serum antibody titres against fnbpa rise as a result of infection  <cit> . antibodies directed against the a domain were greatly elevated in sera of patients who had endocarditis caused by s. aureus, compared to sera of healthy controls  <cit> . this indicates that fnbpa is expressed in vivo, is immunogenic, and that the host mounts a robust immune response against this antigen. the evolution of the fnbpa a domain into distinct isotypes with different antigenicities may have been driven by the need to evade the host immune responses during infection.

it is interesting to note that variation amongst fnbpa appears to be confined to the a domain. analysis of entire fnba genes from sequenced genomes reveals that the fnbpa c-terminal fibronectin-binding motifs  <dig> –  <dig> are highly conserved in amino acid sequence. this is an unfolded domain lacking secondary structure, and undergoes a conformational change to an ordered β-sheet structure upon binding to fibronectin  <cit> . anti-fnbpa antibodies are generated during infection that recognize both the a domain and the fibronectin-binding motifs  <cit> . the antibodies directed against the fibronectin-binding motifis predominantly recognize epitopes formed in the β-sheet structure when fibronectin is bound to fnbpa. ligand-induced binding site  antibodies are not function-blocking  <cit> . indeed, it has been suggested that libs antibodies may be beneficial by stabilizing fibronectin binding and thus enhancing bacterial adherence to the host tissue  <cit> . in contrast the fnbpa a domain is likely to be projected away from the bacterial cell and to be recognized by opsonizing antiodies. however, there is no obvious explanation as to why fnpba a domains have diverged so much whereas proteins with similar a domains such as clfa and clfb are much less divergent  <cit> .

individuals who carry s. aureus have an increased chance of developing invasive disease that is usually caused by the carriage strain, but have a lower mortality rate than non-carriers that develop s. aureus bacteremia  <cit> . carriers have been shown to mount an immune response against the superantigens that are specifically expressed by their colonizing strain  <cit> . generation of a strain-specific immune response might explain the improved prognosis of carriers compared to non-carriers  <cit> . a similar phenomenon might occur with fnbpa, whereby carriers mount a specific immune response to the fnbpa isotype expressed by their colonizing strain and prime the immune system to mount a robust anti-fnbpa antibody response during infection. conversely, fnbpa variation may help strains to infect individuals previously exposed to a different isotype.

the fnba allelic variants encoding many of the  <dig> a domain isotypes were widely distributed. several isotypes were not restricted to specific clones or clonal complexes. indeed, the same a domain isotype was often found in strains that are distantly related based upon the phylogenetic analysis. this suggests that horizontal transfer of fnba loci has occurred. similarly, there is evidence of horizontal transfer of staphylocoagulase serotypes  <cit> . for example, the fnba allelic variants found in strains representative of cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> encoded isotype iii a domains that were extremely similar , yet these strains belong to distantly related clonal complexes. indeed, the fnba allele we sequenced from a st- <dig> strain was identical to the fnba gene of st- <dig> strains mssa <dig> and mw <dig>  which suggests a recent recombination event. further evidence for horizontal transfer is the presence of two different fnbpa a domains isotypes in strains of the same mlst genotye . we found allelic variants encoding isotype iii in st- <dig>  the study of kuhn et al  <cit>  describes two st- <dig> strains carrying fnba alleles  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode isotype ii a domains, while other st- <dig> strains were found carrying alleles  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode type iii a domains. this shows that fnba genes encoding isotype ii or iii a domains are present in st- <dig> strains. it has been suggested that cc <dig> and cc30/ <dig> share a common ancestor  <cit> , so perhaps ancestral st- <dig> strains specified isotype ii as in cc30/ <dig> and that horizontal transfer was responsible for establishing the isotype iii a domain in certain st- <dig> strains.

the fnbpb a domain appears to have evolved in the same way as fnbpa described here. analysis of the fnbpb a domains obtained from genome sequences has identified three fnbpb isotypes and a further four fnbpb a domain isotypes were identified by hybridization and dna sequencing . evidence for interstrain recombination came from the occurrence of different fnbpa and fnbpb isotype combinations in different strains.

amongst the fnbpa a domain, it appears that the minimum ligand-binding truncate  have evolved in parallel into at least  <dig> distinct isotype groupings. this is clearly illustrated in the neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees based upon fnba sub-domain sequences, where a particular n <dig> sub-domain is always found in association with a particular n <dig> sub-domain. the phylogeny of the n <dig> sub-domain appeared to differ from that of the n <dig> sub-domain. for example, the amino acid sequence of the fnbpa n <dig> sub-domain from n <dig> and mu <dig>  is identical to the n <dig> sub-domain from mssa <dig> and mw <dig> . however, their n <dig> sub-domains are only  <dig> % identical. perhaps recombination may have occurred within fnba genes to switch segments encoding domains n <dig> and n <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified seven isotypes of the n-terminal a domain of fnbpa in a collection of s. aureus strains representing the genetic diversity of the species. isotypes are on average  <dig> % divergent in amino acid sequnce. each isotype is functional with respect to ligand-binding activity, but they differ in immuno-crossreactivity, which may play a role in immune evasion. isotypes are distributed randomly throughout the s. aureus population, and homologous recombination may be involved in dissemination of fnba loci amongst s. aureus. these data have implications for the fnbpa a domain as a target for a vaccine or immunotherapeutic.
