BACKGROUND
the peptide hormone ghrelin has a wide range of physiological functions, including a role in appetite stimulation, and energy balance and regulation of the immune and reproductive systems . ghrelin is most abundantly expressed in the stomach of monogastrics and the abomasum  of ruminants, and it is also expressed in a wide range of other tissues . in order to bind and activate its cognate receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a , ghrelin is post-translationally octanoylated by the enzyme ghrelin-o-acyl transferase   <cit> .

the ghrelin axis  is a potential target for improving production in ruminant species through the manipulation of feeding, growth, body composition and immune and reproductive functions . ghrelin or ghsr polymorphisms have been associated with enhanced food intake, growth and body conformation in cattle  <cit> , and ghsr polymorphisms have been associated with carcass traits in sheep  <cit> . ghsr mrna expression was elevated in the pituitary gland of a line of sheep selected for increased fat cover, compared to a lean sheep selection line  <cit> . ghrelin and ghsr1a are thought to regulate reproduction in many species and are expressed in reproductive tissues of sheep .

we previously reported differential ghrelin expression in the gut  and blood  of sheep selected for gastrointestinal nematode resistance compared to susceptible sheep  <cit> , suggesting that ghrelin may play a role in the immunity to parasite infection. here, we report a detailed characterization of the ghrelin gene  in the sheep, ovis aries, and the discovery of novel ghrelin variants with distinct mrna expression in white blood cells in response to helminth infection.

RESULTS
ghrelin gene structure
partial structure and sequence of the ghrelin gene  has been determined in a number of ruminants including cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , goat  <cit>  and water buffalo  <cit> , however, no complete gene structure exists for the sheep gene. to investigate ghrelin gene structure and expression in the sheep, 5′ rlm-race and rt-pcr  were performed using abomasum  and white blood cells . for consistency, we follow the exon numbering nomenclature of the human and murine ghrl genes  <cit> . sequence analysis of 5′ rlm-race products revealed two alternative transcriptional start sites  present in a short 5′ untranslated exon, 13–20 bp in length, which was previously termed exon  <dig> . these tss were found in both the abomasum and wbc.figure  <dig>

using rt-pcr we demonstrated that the canonical preproghrelin variant  is expressed in the abomasum and white blood cells . sequencing confirmed that this 305 bp rt-pcr product consisted of  <dig> exons and the corresponding full-length transcript would encode a  <dig> amino acid preproghrelin protein, identical to the sheep reference sequence . the canonical coding exons of the ovine ghrelin gene are exons  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . although the predominant form of preproghrelin is  <dig> amino acids  in length and mature ghrelin is  <dig> aa in most mammals, the ruminant form of preproghrelin is  <dig> aa and ghrelin is a  <dig> aa peptide, resulting from alternative splicing which removes a codon for glutamine .

two additional rt-pcr products, 191 bp and 82 bp in size, were also amplified . sequencing revealed that the 191 bp mrna isoform  lacks exon  <dig> and has been designated Δex <dig> preproghrelin. translation of Δex <dig> preproghrelin would produce a  <dig> amino acid peptide, consisting of the preproghrelin signal peptide, followed by a  <dig> amino acid peptide that includes a c-terminally truncated ghrelin peptide  and the obestatin sequence  . interestingly, although exon  <dig> is absent from the Δex <dig> preproghrelin mrna sequence, the open reading frame is conserved in mammals . obestatin, a peptide hormone derived from the ghrelin preprohormone  <cit> , has independent functions from its sibling peptide, including autocrine/paracrine roles in the pancreas and adipose tissue  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the 82 bp amplicon  lack exons  <dig> and  <dig> and has been designated Δex <dig>  preproghrelin. like exon 2-deleted preproghrelin, it is predicted that translation of this variant would produce an  <dig> amino acid peptide that contains the preproghrelin signal peptide, followed by the first  <dig> amino acids of the mature ghrelin peptide . a unique  <dig> amino acid c-terminal peptide  is predicted to follow, as removal of the non-symmetrical exon  <dig> creates a frame shift. in contrast to Δex <dig> preproghrelin which is conserved in mammals, only ruminants of the bovidae family harbor an intact Δex <dig>  preproghrelin open reading frame . this include sheep, goat, cow, the water buffalo , and the antelope arabian oryx . the  <dig> amino acid peptide sequence of Δex <dig>  preproghrelin does not present any known sequence motifs that could indicate its possible function .

expression of preproghrelin variants and the ghrelin acylation enzyme in ovine tissues
the tissue distribution of ghrelin in sheep has been reported previously  <cit> . in the earlier study, rt-pcr primers spanned exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the ghrelin gene, excluding the possible amplification of the Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin variants. we screened  <dig> different cell and tissue types for wild-type preproghrelin transcript, the two novel preproghrelin variants and the ghrelin acylation enzyme goat  using rt-pcr. we found that the expression of wild-type preproghrelin and the novel splice variants was tissue specific . full-length preproghrelin was expressed in all tissues examined, with the exception of the urinary bladder, skeletal muscle and wbc . Δex <dig> preproghrelin expression was also detected in many tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract , lymphoid tissue , lung, wbc, and urinary bladder . interestingly, the expression of Δex <dig>  preproghrelin was restricted to wbc, abomasum, small intestine and lymphoid tissue associated with the small intestine. the enzyme goat,  catalyses the octanoylation of ghrelin, allowing it to signal through its cognate receptor, ghsr1a  <cit> . goat is expressed in the abomasum  and pancreas in sheep, and expression has been demonstrated in equivalent tissues in other species  <cit> . goat expression was not detected in a number of sheep tissues that expressed ghrelin variants, including white blood cells, lung and venous tissue , suggesting that the ghrelin peptide or ghrelin peptide variants expressed in these tissues are not acylated. the unmodified form of ghrelin, desacyl ghrelin , is also functional, but acts through an unidentified alternative ghrelin receptor in some cell and tissues  <cit> .table  <dig>

the Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin variants are responsive to parasite infection
we noted that white blood cells expressed Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin, but not wild-type preproghrelin transcripts . on the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that preproghrelin variants may be differentially expressed in response to parasitic worm  infection. blood samples were generated in an earlier experiment in which sheep from the parasite resistant and susceptible lines of a selection flock were challenged with the highly pathogenic nematode, haemonchus contortus  <cit> . expression of Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin was determined in white blood cells  at a number of time points after infection . while the wild-type preproghrelin was not amplified in any wbc samples , expression of both novel preproghrelin variants increased in wbc in susceptible sheep 4 days after infection. from day  <dig>  expression of the variants remained constant.figure  <dig>

having established that the novel Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin variants display a distinct expression pattern in white blood cells following parasite infection, we interrogated the proximal promoter region of the sheep ghrelin gene. as outlined above, rlm-race  revealed that wbcs harbor a transcriptional start site in a short untranslated exon  <dig>  the sequence region upstream of exon  <dig> of ghrelin was analysed for possible promoter features and transcription factor binding sites. a candidate promoter region, which is conserved between sheep and cattle, was identified in the first 450 bp upstream of exon  <dig> . a tata box likely to provide an rna polymerase binding site for ghrl transcription initiation was present 25 bp upstream of exon  <dig>  putative binding sites for members of the ccaat/enhancer binding protein , camp-responsive element binding proteins , krüppel-like factor  and specificity factor  transcription factor families were also identified in this region. three putative klf-binding sites are present in the promoter region within  <dig> base pairs of the ghrl transcriptional start site in sheep. klf <dig> is highly expressed in the stomach and other cells and tissues, has a similar expression pattern to ghrelin and regulates human ghrelin gene expression in the human ags stomach cell line  <cit> . the zinc finger transcription factor klf <dig> interacts with creb and plays a wide range of roles, including the regulation of cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, evidence is emerging that klf <dig> is involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases, including parasite infection . we speculate that klf <dig> plays a role in regulating ghrelin expression in response to helminth infection.

variations on a theme: alternative splicing of the ghrelin gene
a number of peptide preprohormones and neuropeptides are alternatively spliced to produce different isoforms, or peptides with different functions. it is now appreciated that the ghrelin gene locus is a polyhormone locus that, via alternative splicing and post-translational processing, produces a number of bioactive peptides  <cit> . the peptide hormone, obestatin, is derived from the ghrelin preprohormone  <cit>  and has functions which are independent of ghrelin  <cit> . other novel peptides derived from isoforms of the ghrelin preprohormone may also be functional .

we here describe two novel splice variants derived from the sheep ghrelin gene. both Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin contain the conserved ghrelin gssfl amino acid motif, which is the minimum sequence required for binding and stimulation of the ghrelin receptor ghsr1a in vitro  <cit>  and for acylation of ghrelin by goat  <cit> . although the truncated ghrelin variants are likely to have shorter half-lives than full-length ghrelin  <cit> , these isoforms could have both endocrine effects , as well as autocrine/paracrine actions in peripheral tissues.

a previous study conducted in our laboratory showed differential levels of ghrelin in the gut  and blood  of sheep selected for gastrointestinal helminth resistance compared to susceptible sheep  <cit> , suggesting that ghrelin is associated with immunity to parasite infection. given a lack of wild-type preproghrelin and differential expression pattern in white blood cell noted between the resistant and susceptible sheep in the current study, these new variants are likely to play a role in immunity. in particular, the finding that the expression of the Δex <dig>  preproghrelin variant is limited to white blood cells and the gut, suggests that there is a direct link between tissues of the digestive tract and circulating immune cells. Δex <dig>  preproghrelin would be translated into a peptide that contains the minimal active region of ghrelin, and a novel  <dig> amino acid peptide.

CONCLUSIONS
although further larger studies are required, we speculate that Δex <dig> preproghrelin and Δex <dig>  preproghrelin are translated into bioactive peptides that function during the early stage of an effective response to gastrointestinal nematodes. in addition, the variants and their derived peptides may be useful in predicting susceptibility and resistance to parasitic infection. the recognition of novel preproghrelin variants should aid in interpreting studies linking expression of the ghrelin gene to phenotypic differences in ruminant production animals.
