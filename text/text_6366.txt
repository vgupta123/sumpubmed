BACKGROUND
phytoestrogens are naturally occurring, plant derived, non-steroid molecules that are structurally similar to 17beta-estradiol  <cit> . of all the phytoestrogens, soy-derived isoflavones are the most abundant in rodent and human diets, and the most studied in animal and clinical research. dietary soy isoflavones exist as biologically active aglycones  and biologically inactive glucosides . when consumed, glucosides are hydrolyzed by intestinal glucosidases to daidzein and genistein. daidzein can be further metabolized to equol, a potent and abundant molecule in rodents  <cit> . the structural similarity between isoflavones and 17beta-estradiol enables these molecules to exert moderate estrogenic or antiestrogenic properties via mammalian estrogen receptors . it is well established that genistein has a greater affinity for erbeta than eralpha  <cit> . moreover, equol appears to bind erbeta > eralpha, in a similar manner to that of genistein  <cit> .

the anteroventrol periventricular nucleus  is located immediately caudal to the vascular organ of the lamina terminalis and rostral to the suprachiasmatic nucleus  <cit> . the cells in avpv project directly to gonadotropin releasing hormone -containing neurons and influence the secretion of luteinizing hormone  in rats  <cit> . the avpv is sexually dimorphic, but in contrast to other sexually dimorphic nuclei, the overall volume  <cit> , cell density  <cit> , and the number of dopaminergic neurons  <cit>  are greater in females compared to males in adulthood. these sex differences are regulated by testosterone secreted from the fetal/neonatal testes. there are two surges in circulating testosterone during early development, one occurring around gestation day  <dig> and the other at approximately  <dig> hours after birth  <cit> . within the hypothalamus, testosterone can be converted to 17beta-estradiol by the cytochrome p <dig> aromatase enzyme, and 17beta-estradiol is thought to be responsible for smaller avpv characteristics in males  <cit> . this "estrogenic masculinization" process can be manipulated by induction of steroid hormones during the development. administration of estradiol to neonatal rats is as effective as testosterone in reducing the volume of avpv  <cit>  by facilitating apoptosis in the developing avpv  <cit> . the sexual differentiation of avpv was thought to be limited to early postnatal period. however, the avpv characteristics develop as late as 60– <dig> days after birth  <cit> , and more recent data suggests that they are more plastic than previously thought  <cit> .

in light of the estrogenic nature of soy isoflavones and their ability to cross the blood brain barrier  <cit> , we have studied the effects of soy isoflavones on characteristics of the avpv. in two separate studies, we observed a significant decrease in avpv volume in adult male rats consuming a soy isoflavone-rich diet compared to animals fed a soy isoflavone-free diet  <cit> . however, it is not known whether soy isoflavones act in a similar manner as 17beta-estradiol to alter the volume of avpv by influencing apoptosis or whether equol contributes to the alteration of avpv volume. therefore, in this study we examined the influence of dietary soy isoflavones on apoptosis in adult male rats, by quantifying its incidence, identifying the cell type involved, and exploring its correlation with estrogen receptor subtypes. finally, the volume of avpv was quantified in adult male rats after exposure to equol only, a major biologically active isoflavone metabolite.

RESULTS
consumption of soy isoflavones induces apoptosis in avpv
the effects of dietary soy isoflavones on apoptosis in avpv were examined by tunel staining on coronal brain sections, identified as a cell cluster at the rostral level of the third ventricle . the total cell number in avpv was not significantly altered in the phyto- <dig> fed male rats  compared to the phyto-free fed animals . however, the total apoptotic cell number in the phyto- <dig> avpv  was significantly greater than that in the phyto-free group . furthermore, the incidence of apoptosis, calculated as a percentage of the total population of cells, was about  <dig> times higher in the phyto- <dig> group than in the phyto-free group .

a the rats were exposed to either a soy isoflavone-free diet  or a soy isoflavone-rich diet  from conception until  <dig> days of age .

b incidence of apoptosis was expressed as the percentage of apoptotic cell number over total cell number in avpv.

^ significantly greater apoptotic cell number or incidence of apoptosis in the phyto- <dig> avpv compared to the phyto-free group .

when the cell densities within the avpv were calculated, the rats on the phyto- <dig> diet displayed significantly greater cell numbers per unit area than the animals on the phyto-free diet . interestingly, after accounting for the incidence of apoptotic cells, the significant differences between the diet treatment groups for cell densities disappeared .

the apoptotic cells induced by soy isoflavones are neurons
to determine whether glia or neurons account for the apoptotic cells in avpv observed previously, we detected the markers for astrocytes  and neurons  on the adjacent sections of phyto- <dig> fed male rats, which were  <dig> micrometers apart from the tunel stained sections. more than 90% of the apoptotic cells were present on both of the consecutive sections. thus, by locating the apoptotic cells  on the photomicrographs of dual gfap/neun if staining , the apoptotic cells were identified as neurons .

the number of dopaminergic neurons in avpv was not altered by soy isoflavones
tyrosine hydroxylase has proven to be a reliable marker for dopaminergic neurons in avpv even though there are relatively few th cells in this sexually dimorphic structure. dopaminergic neurons in avpv were detected with immunohistochemical staining of th in  <dig> day-old male and female and  <dig> day-old female rats fed the phyto-free diet and  <dig> day-old males fed on either phyto-free or phyto- <dig> diet. independent of diet treatment, we observed significantly more th neurons in females  than in males fed the phyto-free diet at both ages. however, no significant difference in the sparse number of th neurons was observed in male rats with long-term exposure to dietary soy isoflavones  compared to the phyto-free fed males .

the apoptotic neurons express erbeta, but not eralpha
the expression of eralpha and erbeta was detected on coronal brain sections containing avpv, which were  <dig> micrometers apart from the tunel stained sections. eralpha and erbeta immunoreactivity was expressed in cell nuclei of the avpv . in avpv, the number of eralpha-ir and erbeta-ir nuclei and total counterstained cell number were counted. the ratio of erbeta-ir cells in avpv, expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells, was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in the phyto- <dig> fed animals. this represents a 22% reduction when compared to the phyto-free values . no significant differences in the number of eralpha-ir cells in avpv were observed between the phyto- <dig> group  and phyto-free group . furthermore, by locating the apoptotic cells on the sections of eralpha and erbeta ihc staining, most the apoptotic cells were erbeta-ir, but not eralpha-ir . in phyto- <dig> fed rats, tunel-positive cells represent approximately 84% of the erbeta-ir cells within the avpv. a schematic diagram displayed in figure  <dig> represents the total number of cells in the avpv relative to the total number of erbeta-ir cells and tunel stained cells. last, comparing eralpha and erbeta ihc sections, we noticed that some cells solely express eralpha or erbeta. however, some cells express both eralpha and erbeta .

exposure to equol  does not alter the volume of avpv
to further test whether equol is the molecule that causes the effects observed above, equol or control  vehicle was injected subcutaneously into adult male rats fed the phyto-free diet. the equol injection treatment was given for  <dig> consecutive days. the serum circulating equol levels were equivalent to consuming a phytoestrogen-rich soy diet   <cit> . interestingly, there were no significant alterations in avpv volumetric morphometric parameters with the exposure to equol . so, exposure solely to equol is not sufficient to alter the hormone-sensitive hypothalamic volume  in male rats during adulthood which is opposite to the consumption of soy  via dietary routes for an equivalent exposure interval previously observed by our laboratory  <cit> .

discussion
this study directly demonstrates that long-term exposure to dietary soy isoflavones induces neuronal apoptosis in the avpv of adult male rats. additionally, the present data suggests that the influence of soy isoflavones on neuronal apoptosis is not correlated to eralpha but dependent on erbeta. however, exposure to equol is not sufficient to alter the volume of avpv.

neurons in the avpv are born between gestation day  <dig> and gestation day  <dig>  <cit> . neither neurogenesis  <cit>  nor neuronal migration  <cit>  has been reported to play a role in the development of sexual dimorphism in the preoptic area. however, it has been demonstrated that apoptosis is the major way that steroid hormones alter neuronal numbers in sexually dimorphic regions during critical periods of development  <cit> . this critical period for sexual differentiation was revised to be longer than the perinatal and first week postnatal window  <cit> , and the volume of the sexually dimorphic nuclei can still be changed by exposure to estrogenic molecules in adults  <cit> . therefore, it is novel, but not surprising, to observe significantly higher incidence of apoptosis in the avpv of adult male rats consuming soy isoflavones, via their estrogenic actions. generally, tunel is a well-accepted technique to detect apoptotic cells by visualization of dna fragmentation  <cit> . cells with dna damage may also be identified by tunel staining. thus, the tunel-positive cells in this study include apoptotic cells and possibly cells in the process of dna repair  <cit> . furthermore, these tunel-positive cells were identified as neurons. this is the first direct evidence of soy isoflavones inducing neuronal apoptosis in avpv in vivo. additionally, taking the increased cellular density and the similar total cell number in the phyto- <dig> avpv sections together, these data implied smaller avpv volumes in the phyto- <dig> group vs. the phyto-free group, which is consistent with our previous findings  <cit> . implications to human health and reproduction are unknown, especially since reproductive capacity of asian populations appears to be unaffected by consumption of soy foods  <cit> .

it is known that the number of dopaminergic neurons in avpv is 3– <dig> times higher in adult female rats than in males  <cit> . although th neurons only contribute approximately 1% of the total number of cells in male avpv , no significant difference in the number of th neurons was observed in adult male rats between the treatment groups. there is evidence that circulating gonadal steroids appear to downregulate th expression in both male and female avpvs  <cit> . the development of sexually dimorphic th neurons is not affected by the overexpression of bcl- <dig>  <cit>  or deletion of bax  <cit> , but is dependent on eralpha  <cit> . the lack of changes in the number of th neurons in the male  and female  rats with long-term exposure to isoflavones  suggests that the neuronal apoptosis may be independent of eralpha. furthermore, the incidence of apoptosis was approximately 33% and the ratio of eralpha-ir cells over the total cells in avpv was approximately 64% in the phyto- <dig> group. moreover, in this case the apoptotic cells were not eralpha-ir. this suggests that eralpha is not involved in the apoptosis by consumption of soy isoflavones.

the co-localization of erbeta and dna fragmentation implies erbeta may mediate the neuronal apoptosis induced by soy isoflavones in male avpv. this is consistent with several lines of evidence. first, both eralpha and erbeta have been reported to be expressed in the avpv  <cit> . the expression of erbeta is sexually dimorphic in rodents. in mice, females a significantly larger number of erbeta-positive cells were positioned in the medial portion of the avpv close to third ventricle; in males the distribution of erbeta-positive cells were dispersed throughout the avpv  <cit> . the apoptotic cells observed in the phyto- <dig> avpvs did not show a specific pattern, in other words, similar to the expression of erbeta in male avpv. second, it has been reported that estrogen-regulated developmental neuronal apoptosis is determined by er subtype: eralpha has a neuroprotective effect, while erbeta medicates the induction of apoptosis in neuronal cells  <cit> . third, dopaminergic neurons express erbeta in the female avpv, but not in males  <cit> . this partially favors that erbeta-expressing dopaminergic neurons go through apoptosis in males in the presence of testosterone/estrogen, but not in females. on the contrary, in females these cells are thought to survive. fourth, eralpha and erbeta are coexpressed in some cells in avpv  <cit> . when coexpressed, eralpha and erbeta form functional heterodimers  <cit> . even though the biological roles of eralpha/beta heterodimers in the presence of each respective homodimer are unknown, erbeta exhibits an inhibitory action on eralpha-mediated gene expression and in many instances opposes the actions of eralpha  <cit> . additionally, we observed more erbeta-ir cells than apoptotic cells in avpv. hence, we speculate neurons that coexpressed eralpha and erbeta may escape apoptosis, whereas those expressing only erbeta are sensitive to the estrogenic signal and showed dna fragmentation. finally, although isoflavones are less potent than 17beta-estradiol, the plasma concentrations of genistein  and equol  in the phyto- <dig> fed male rats are much greater than that of 17beta-estradiol   <cit> . the average total isoflavone content within the hypothalamus is more than 3-fold higher for phyto- <dig> fed males  vs. phyto-free fed males   <cit> . furthermore, isoflavones possess a higher affinity for erbeta than eralpha  <cit> . so the influence of isoflavones is sufficient to cause a variety of biological effects via estrogen receptors, especially erbeta. we speculate that genistein or other isoflavone molecule may be responsible for the increased neuronal apoptosis observed in this study.

it is intriguing to consider the following hypothesis as to how dietary soy isoflavones modulate avpv cell and volume characteristics via erbeta. first, it is well established that estrogens decrease avpv volumes during pre- and postnatal development  <cit> . second, it is also well established that the aromatase cytochrome p <dig> enzyme  is present in neuronal hypothalamic regions and that aromatase mrna expression and aromatase enzymatic levels decline with increasing postnatal age, especially after puberty, compared to the prenatal developmental interval  <cit> . thus, even though there is abundant steroid substrate from the testes  during adulthood, the levels of hypothalamic aromatase decline more than 50-fold compared to prenatal levels. this dramatically decreases the local biosynthesis of estrogens. in this way, consumption of an isoflavone-rich diet  greatly increases the concentration of estrogen-like molecules in the circulation and in the hypothalamus . therefore, this would suggest that there are very low levels of endogenous estrogens being formed within hypothalamic regions, while very high circulating estrogen-like isoflavone molecules having the ability to bind erbeta account for the increase in apoptosis in the avpv of phyto- <dig> fed males, versus very little apoptosis was as seen in the avpv of phyto-free fed males. compared with the "estrogenic masculinization" during male avpv development, the "dietary phytoestrogenic masculinization" is likely to be a mechanism underlying the loss of erbeta-containing neurons we observed in these adult male rats. even though it is not certain that the increased cell death in adult male avpv is beneficial; it could be speculated that it is not detrimental. the influence of dietary isoflavones on apoptosis was studied in the present study at  <dig> days of age when the characteristics of avpv have been fully developed while the volume of avpv was reported to be affected by dietary treatment. further research at different developmental stages is essential to explore how isoflavones influence neuronal apoptosis.

finally, plenty of information in the literature shows that conventional research and development approaches fail to fully isolate or identify chemicals for synthesis of analogues from well-known chinese medicinal plants  <cit> . it is not surprising that equol injection, with equivalent exposure level and interval to dietary consumption described previously, did not alter hormone-sensitive hypothalamic volumes in rats during adulthood. this indicates that multiple factors or a combination with genistein may be required to alter brain structures in the sensitive rat model.

CONCLUSIONS
the present experiments demonstrate that the consumption of soy isoflavones 1) induces neuronal apoptosis and/or dna fragmentation in the avpv of adult male rats, 2) the number of eralpha-dependent dopaminergic neurons is not altered by the diet treatments, and 3) almost all the apoptotic cells are erbeta-ir, but not eralpha-ir. however, exposure to equol does not alter avpv volume. in summary, these findings provide direct evidence that consumption of soy isoflavones influences loss of erbeta-containing neurons in male avpv.

since soy dietary content is usually not considered as an experimental variable, future research designs should take into account this potential important and pervasive hormonal factor.
