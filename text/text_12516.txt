BACKGROUND
stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen in hospitalized or compromised patients  <cit> . in the last decade, it has emerged as one of the most frequently found bacteria in cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit> . however, the role of this opportunistic pathogen as an innocent bystander or causative agent often remains unclear  <cit>  and little is known about its virulence factors  <cit> .

biofilms, sessile structured bacterial communities exhibiting recalcitrance to antimicrobial compounds and persistence despite sustained host defenses, are increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to disease pathogenesis in cf and other respiratory tract diseases associated with chronic bacterial infections  <cit> . while s. maltophilia

cf isolates are known to have the ability to form biofilms on both abiotic surfaces  <cit>  and cf-derived epithelial monolayer  <cit> , it is not clear whether there is an intrinsic difference in biofilm formation among genomically diverse environmental and clinical isolates of s. maltophilia.

the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm formation in s. maltophilia have not been extensively studied. recently, mutants for the glucose-1-phosphate thymidyltransferase rmla gene and for the cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid rpff gene are reported to decrease biofilm formation  <cit> . further, the spgm gene, encoding a bifunctional enzyme with both phosphoglucomutase  and phosphomannomutase activities, could be involved in biofilm-forming ability because of the homology with the algc gene that is responsible for the production of a pgm associated with lps and alginate biosynthesis in p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

several typing schemes have been used successfully in the molecular epidemiology of s. maltophilia strains in an attempt to investigate the epidemiology of infections and nosocomial outbreaks caused by this microorganism. phenotypic methods - such as serotyping, antibiotyping and biotyping - have proven to be poorly discriminative because of a low interstrain variability  <cit> . molecular typing techniques have been successfully used to study the epidemiology of s. maltophilia revealing a genetically high diversity in this species  <cit> .

in this study, we examined a set of  <dig> isolates of s. maltophilia - obtained from clinical  and environmental sources - for phenotypic  and genotypic  traits in order to find significant differences among the groups considered. in addition, the relationship between biofilm production and the detection of rmla, spgm, and rpff genes was evaluated. virulence was also assessed by using an experimental model of airborne lung infection.

our results indicate that cf s. maltophilia isolates significantly differ in many phenotypic aspects when compared with non-cf isolates, thus suggesting the existence of a "cf phenotype".

RESULTS
cf and non-cf isolates exhibit comparable relevant genetic heterogeneity
as shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  types were identified among the  <dig> s. maltophilia clinical isolates studied:  <dig> and  <dig> different pfge profiles were respectively observed among non-cf and cf isolates, showing a comparable genetic heterogeneity . no cases of pfge types shared by cf and non-cf isolates were found. eight pfge types were represented by multiple isolates,  <dig> of which detected among non-cf isolates and  <dig> among cf isolates.

pfge of  <dig> sequential isolates , collected from the same cf patient over a period of  <dig> years, showed the presence of two different pulsotypes . another case of isolates recovered from the same patient was represented by isolates sm <dig>  sm <dig>  and sm <dig>  all sharing pfge type  <dig> . along with visual interpretation, computer-assisted cluster analysis by using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages  was also performed. genetically related isolates showed a similarity of > 90% which corresponded to up to  <dig> bands of difference between  <dig> given pfge profiles. among  <dig> env isolates included in this study,  <dig> different pfge types were found, with two isolates  sharing genetically related pfge type with a non-cf isolate .

cf isolates are less effective than non-cf ones in forming biofilm
most of s. maltophilia strains were able to form biofilm, although a significantly higher proportion of biofilm-positive strains was observed among non-cf strains, compared to cf ones  .

biofilm forming ability varied greatly among strains tested , although values distribution was significantly less skewed among cf strains compared to non-cf and env strains . similarly, among env strains variability in biofilm levels formed at 25°c was significantly lower than that observed at 37°c .

the mean biofilm formed by cf strains as a whole was significantly lower than that formed by non-cf strains  , even after normalization on mean generation time  . no difference in biofilm formation was observed between clinical and env isolates . with regard to biofilm categories, a significantly higher percentage of weak and strong biofilm producers was found in non-cf strains compared to cf ones  . contrarily, cf group exhibited a significantly higher proportion of moderate biofilm forming strains  . no significant difference in biofilm levels formed by non-cf strains was found according to the isolation site, although among respiratory strains, non-cf strains produced significantly higher biofilm levels compared to cf ones  .

cf isolates grow slower and are more sensitive to h2o <dig>  compared to non-cf ones
cf isolates showed higher mean generation time compared to non-cf ones  . indeed, env isolates grown at 37°c exhibited a significantly lower generation time compared to that observed at 25°c  . no significant relationship was found between growth rate and the biofilm biomass formed, regardless of group considered .

susceptibility to oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition formed by each strain following exposure to  <dig> % h2o <dig>  the mean zone of inhibition exhibited by cf strains  resulted to be significantly higher than that observed by non-cf , and env strains  .

phenotypic characteristics exhibited by cf sequential isogenic isolates undergo alterations during the course of chronic infection
five s. maltophilia strains, isolated from the same cf patient over a period of  <dig> years and belonging to the same pulsotype, were investigated for phenotypic variations with regard to biofilm formation, mean generation time, swimming and twitching motility, and susceptibility to h2o <dig>  as shown in figure 4a, biofilm amount formed by sm <dig>  was significantly  higher than other genetically indistinguishable isolates . spectrophotometric results were confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy  analysis showing significant differences in biofilm ultrastructure formed by the sequential isolates . in particular, the biofilm formed by sm <dig> strain resulting to be the most complex, revealing a multilayered cell structure  embedded in an abundant extracellular polymeric substance  . these features were not observed for the other isolates showing either poor attachment  or forming monolayer biofilm lacking eps  .

significant differences were also found among sequential isolates in some cases concerning susceptibility to oxidative stress  and swimming motility  .

swimming and twitching motilities are critical for biofilm development in cf strains
overall,  <dig> nonmotile strains,  <dig> non-cf strains and  <dig> cf strains, with neither swimming nor twitching motility were observed, with only  <dig> of them resulting in the inability to form biofilm. no significant differences were seen in motility, in the percentage of motile strains, and in the mean motility level between cf and non-cf isolates . similarly, among env isolates growth temperature did not significantly affect neither swimming nor twitching motility .

interestingly, swimming and twitching motilities were positively correlated to biofilm biomass  in cf strains only. no statistically significant differences were found among the motility patterns  with respect to the biofilm formed .

cf and non-cf isolates show comparable virulence in a mouse model of lung infection
as shown in figure 5a, a weight reduction of at least 10% was observed on day  <dig> post-exposure  in mice infected with invasive sm <dig> and sm <dig> strains and those exposed to non-cf sm <dig>  and later for mice exposed to cf strains . by day  <dig> p.e. the mean weight of infected mice was significantly  lower than that of control mice. by day  <dig> p.e., only infected mice with non-cf strains  and the invasive sm <dig> strain slowly started regaining weight, although only mice infected with sm <dig> strain regained it completely on day  <dig> p.e.. control mice lost not more than 1% of their body weight during the study-period monitored. all infected mice showed symptoms of slow responsiveness and piloerection from day  <dig> through day  <dig> p.e..

lung clearance results of s. maltophilia infection are summarized in figure 5b. the initial deposition of s. maltophilia in the mouse lung was assessed by viable count  <dig> h p.e.. all s. maltophilia strains were almost completely eradicated from mouse lung , while sm <dig> cf and sm <dig> non-cf blood isolates were eradicated less effectively  than non-cf respiratory strains , although these differences were not statistically significant. no correlation was found between in vitro biofilm formation and in vivo lung colonization.

pulmonary levels of cytokines detected on day  <dig> p.e. are shown in figure 5c. higher levels of tnf-α were significantly observed in the lungs of mice infected by sm <dig> cf strain, compared to control mice . moreover, higher levels of kc were observed on day  <dig> p.e. in the lungs of mice infected by invasive sm <dig> strain, compared to control mice .

different genotypes are associated to strong biofilm formation in cf and non-cf isolates
pcr-based typing of  <dig>  s. maltophilia strains for spgm, rmla, and rpff genes showed an overall prevalence of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively.

the presence of rmla, spgm or rpff did not significantly affect the mean amount of biofilm formed by cf or non-cf isolates. however, considering the strain population as a whole, the presence of rmla significantly improved biofilm formation .

with regard to biofilm categories, in cf strains displaying strong and moderate biofilm-producer phenotype the frequencies of spgm+ and rpff+ isolates were significantly  higher than rmla+ ones . among non-cf strong biofilm producer strains, frequencies of spgm+ and rmla+ strains were significantly  higher than rpff+ ones .

eight genotypes were observed with wide range percentages  and those with the highest frequency were rmla+/spgm+/rpff+ , rmla-/spgm+/rpff+ , and rmla+/spgm+/rpff- .

analysis of molecular variance  followed by pairwise fst values comparison highlighted significant variance  in genotypes distribution between cf and non-cf strains, and also between env and respectively cf and non-cf strains. in particular, rmla-/spgm+/rpff+ and rmla+/spgm+/rpff- genotypes were differentially observed, the first one accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> %  while the second one for  <dig> % and  <dig> %  in cf and non-cf strains, respectively .

within each group the genotypes did not significantly differ for mean amount of biofilm formed . however, with regard to genotype rmla+/spgm+/rpff+ cf isolates formed significantly decreased biofilm amounts compared to non-cf ones .

the genetic network in figure 6b shows the proportion of strong-, moderate-, weak- and no-biofilm producer strains associated to each observed genotype. correlation analysis showed that genotypes differentially detected in cf  and non-cf  strains were both associated to strong biofilm producers . however, cf genotypes were also correlated to no biofilm producer strains  while non-cf strains were correlated to weak biofilm producer ones .

discussion
in the present study, we comparatively studied phenotypic and genotypic traits of  <dig> s. maltophilia isolates  collected from geographically diversified areas.

to date, the epidemiology of s. maltophilia in cf patients has not been fully clarified. molecular typing methods revealed a genetically high diversity within s. maltophilia strains, both from hospitalized cf and non-cf patients  <cit> . our results confirmed the high degree of diversity between isolates from hospitalized cf and non-cf patients, thus suggesting that cf pulmonary s. maltophilia infections are mainly associated with a predominant strain. nevertheless, we observed several examples of pfge types shared by multiple isolates in both cf  and non-cf  patients. in particular, the major pfge type  <dig> clone identified, represented by  <dig> strains recovered from non replicate cf patients, likely indicate the occurrence of person-to-person transmission of s. maltophilia strains, the acquisition of this specific clone from a common source, or an independent acquisition of a widely-spread strain type. the dissemination and spread of a specific clone may be due to the circulation of a transmissible strain among cf patients, probably due to a better fitness of this specific clone in the cf pulmonary niche or from an environmental source.

interestingly, distinct pfge types were found between cf isolates and non-cf isolates. further studies are warranted to evaluate if factors associated to the virulence could affect this important segregation among these two settings.

these results could reflect an extensive spread of s. maltophilia in the environment thus suggesting the existence of natural reservoirs of bacterial strains able to cause pathogenicity once acquired by cf patients. contrary to p. aeruginosa, it has not been reported yet that s. maltophilia is capable of making the transition from an environmental state to a colonizing state in cf patients. however, marzuillo et al  <cit>  found a persistence of the same s. maltophilia strain in water, taps, and sinks of different rooms of an italian cf center, although no correlation was observed between clinical and water-associated isolates. furthermore, we recently observed that environmental s. maltophilia is potentially virulent, although to a lesser extent than cf one, in a murine model of lung infection  <cit> . moreover, our results showed that two environmental isolates  shared genetically related pfge type with a non-cf isolate . thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that the acquisition of pathogenic s. maltophilia strains can occur directly from the natural environment.

s. maltophilia is capable of adhering to and forming biofilm not only on polystyrene  <cit> , but also on cf bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> , suggesting that biofilm formation could be a critical step in colonisation of cf lung.

while s. maltophilia possesses complex, diversified genomes  <cit>  and forms biofilms, it is not yet known whether there are any variations in biofilm formation among clonally diverse clinical and environmental isolates. in the present study, microtiter colorimetric assay for biofilm formation showed a wide range of biofilm formation ability in both cf and non-cf groups, from biofilm-deficient phenotypes to those producing structurally complex biofilms. however, when grouped, cf isolates were found to form an amount of biofilm significantly lower compared to that observed among non-cf isolates. to exclude the possibility that these differences in biofilm formation could arise from differences in growth efficiency  <cit> , biofilm levels were normalized on growth rate calculated for each strain.

although the mean growth rate of cf isolates was significantly lower than non-cf ones - probably because of the phenotypic regulation of virulence factor expression by quorum sensing mechanisms or by in vivo bacterial microevolution driven by selective lung environmental conditions, mechanisms already described in bacteria  <cit>  - significant differences in biofilm formation were maintained also after normalization, thus indicating that in s. maltophilia biofilm formation is not influenced by growth rate.

the reduced efficiency in forming biofilm and the increased mean generation time exhibited by cf isolates could be the consequences of s. maltophilia adaptation to a stressed environment such as cf lung  <cit> . to verify this hypothesis, five isogenic sequential s. maltophilia strains isolated from the same cf patient over a period of  <dig> years were investigated for phenotypic variations. our results showed that isogenic serial strains significantly differ in biofilm forming ability, susceptibility to oxidative stress, and swimming motility suggesting that different s. maltophilia phenotypes evolve within the cf respiratory tract during chronic infection. particularly, the reduction in biofilm formation ability of sequential isolates is suggestive for the phenotypic conversion of s. maltophilia during chronic infection. clsm analysis showed that isolates from the early periods of chronic infection were able to form uniform flat biofilms or highly structured, multilayered and exopolysaccharide matrix-encased, biofilms. on the contrary, isolates recovered from the late phase of chronic infection showed a significant reduction in adherence, lacking ability to form a mature biofilm. significant differences were also found with regard to susceptibility to oxidative stress and swimming motility.

these results suggest that the onset of chronic infection could be transformative for s. maltophilia, probably reflecting an adaptive behavior that enables s. maltophilia to survive to the environmental stresses that are likely to be encountered within the habitat of the cf lung, such as  low free iron, and anaerobic conditions  <cit> . in support of this, the phenotypic changes observed in p. aeruginosa isolates collected during different periods of chronic infection from cf patients, included loss of flagella or pilus mediated motility, loss of o antigen components of the lps, as well as appearance of auxotrophic variants  <cit> .

biofilm formation is a multistep process requiring participation of structural appendages, such as flagella and type iv pili  <cit> . recently, we showed that the flagellum plays a direct role, as an adhesin, in s. maltophilia adhesion to ib3- <dig> bronchial cells  <cit> .

to test whether variations in biofilm formation we observed in s. maltophilia could be due to altered activities of these structural appendages, we measured the swimming and twitching abilities of the tested isolates. although most of the isolates tested were able to move by swimming and twitching motilities, a lack of both motilities was observed in  <dig>  non-cf strains and  <dig>  cf strains. of these  <dig> non-motile strains, only  <dig> cf strains were unable to form biofilm, thus suggesting that in s. maltophilia, as well as p. aeruginosa  <cit> , motility is not an absolute requirement for biofilm formation  <cit> . it is worthy of note that both swimming and twitching motilities were positively correlated with biofilm levels in cf group only. taken together, our observations indicate that, although not involved in the initial attachment of s. maltophilia, flagella and type iv pili play a critical role in biofilm development in the cf isolates, thus suggesting the existence of a peculiar mechanism involved in the control of biofilm formation in the cf lung.

the molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation have not been extensively studied in s. maltophilia. recently, fouhy et al.  <cit>  described in s. maltophilia a cell-cell signaling mediated by a diffusible signal factor  whose synthesis is fully dependent on rpff. the rpff mutant showed severely reduced motility, altered lps profiles and decreased biofilm formation  <cit> . huang et al.  <cit>  found that alteration in lipopolysaccharide , caused by the rmla mutation, contributed to changes in flagella and type iv pili, thus interfering with motility, attachment, and biofilm formation  <cit> . a bifunctional spgm-encoded enzyme with both phosphoglucomutase  and phosphomannomutase activities was also found in s. maltophilia  <cit> . since spgm gene is a homologue of the algc gene, responsible for the production of a pgm associated with lps and alginate biosynthesis in p. aeruginosa, it is plausible to hypothesize an involvement of this gene also in s. maltophilia biofilm formation.

in the present study we also focused our efforts on the relationship between biofilm formation and the presence of rpff, rmla and spgm genes. our results showed that rmla-/spgm+/rpff+ and rmla+/spgm+/rpff- genotypes are significantly associated to cf and non-cf groups, respectively. furthermore, we found a significant association between the detection of these genes and the biofilm expression profiles, indicating that strong biofilm-producer isolates are significantly associated to both genotypes.

overall, our results may endorse the central role of spgm gene in s. maltophilia biofilm formation ability, whose presence is significantly associated to a strong biofilm formation, both in non-cf and cf strains. on the contrary, the contribution of rpff and rmla is different on the basis of the group considered, thus confirming that biofilm formation is differently regulated in cf and non-cf strains.

the hallmark of the infected cf lung is a chronic neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation, and cytokine release  <cit> . activated neutrophils and macrophages are major sources of oxygen free radicals including hydrogen peroxide. jobsis et al.  <cit>  recently showed that in cf children with acute infective pulmonary exacerbations exhaled h2o <dig> levels were higher than those found in healthy children.

starting from these evidences we evaluated s. maltophilia sensitivity to oxidative stress by exposure to h2o <dig> on solid agar. our results revealed that cf isolates exhibited a higher level of susceptibility than the non-cf strains to this particular roi species. as already stated by head & yu  <cit>  with regard to p. aeruginosa cf isolates, it could also be possible in s. maltophilia cf isolates an impaired production of superoxide dismutase, catalase or peroxidase, thus explaining their limited ability to survive and proliferate under in vitro oxidative stress.

the virulence of s. maltophilia from different sources was evaluated by using an aerogenic acute lung infection mouse model we recently described  <cit> . although pulmonary eradication on day  <dig> p.e. resulted high  for all strains tested, sm <dig> cf and sm <dig> non-cf blood isolates were markedly less capable of being cleared than non-cf respiratory ones. the apparent disagreement between these findings and the higher susceptibility to h2o <dig> exhibited by cf isolates is probably due to the fact that neutrophil migration from the bloodstream to the lungs occurs in the early hours following infection. no correlation was found between in vitro biofilm formation and in vivo lung colonization, reasonably because the aerosol mouse model we used simulates an acute infection condition caused by planktonic cells, thus not allowing biofilm formation. contrary to the findings by waters et al  <cit> , our results suggested that s. maltophilia cf strains were more immunostimulatory than non-cf ones with regard to tnf-α - a potent proinflammatory cytokine that induces neutrophil and macrophage activation - and kc - a keratinocyte-derived chemoattractant for neutrophils. this is a very important feature in the initial colonization of the airways and development of pneumonia. further in vivo studies employing an adequate number of isolates are needed to clarify the clinical significance of our results.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that s. maltophilia cf strains significantly differ from non-cf ones in some phenotypic traits. considering that adaptability is the key to successful colonization of an environmental niche, these particular responses taken characteristically by cf isolates could be the biological price to evade the hostile and heterogeneous cf lung environments. in fact, the cf lung environment, representing a more extreme environment to adapt to than other clinical ones, could tax the cellular resources of cf strains to a greater extent than those of the non-cf clinical isolates, thus resulting in the selection of a "cf phenotype" for s. maltophilia. the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypic differences might be relevant to the identification of new targets for designing rational and effective methods to combat and eradicate s. maltophilia infection.
