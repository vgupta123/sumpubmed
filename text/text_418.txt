BACKGROUND
large scale genome-wide association studies  have revealed numerous candidate risk alleles for complex disorders, such as myocardial infarction  and coronary artery disease   <cit> . however, genetic risk of disease at the population level cannot be accounted for by individual genetic variants in single genes or even by summing the individual effects of dozens of genes – a gap often referred to as the ‘missing heritability’  <cit> . thus far, epistasis has also failed to account for heritability  <cit> . other factors may involve additional loci not detectable by gwas, non-additive interactions between candidate genes, and external factors modulating gene expression and interactions  <cit> . here, we consider the potential of non-additive effects to contribute to disease risk. instead of restricting the analysis to genetic variants, we focus on rna expression levels that integrate multiple factors including genetic differences influencing expression, gene-gene interactions, feedback mechanisms, and environmental influence.

previous studies of differential mrna expression in mi and related phenotypes have identified ~ <dig>  individual genes, but less than 5 % replicate across more than one study . poor replication is often attributed to differences in cohorts and methodology between studies, but also reflects the fact that disease relevant signals are dispersed across many interacting genes  and that gene expression varies greatly across individuals with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. low reproducibility of differentially expressed genes limits the biological interpretation and utility of these findings.

using cluster analysis, go enrichment analysis, and a variety of machine-learning approaches, studies of differential expression in mi have also implicated particular pathways  and cell types  . efforts however have not yet been made to quantify the non-additive effects of gene interactions that could be revealed from rna expression patterns varying in the context of mi. dynamic non-additive interactions could represent essential elements since complex diseases likely do not arise from single perturbations but rather a dysregulation of the molecular network. indeed, wu et al. find pairwise non-linear interactions to be important for disease classification and biomarker development  <cit> .

in the present paper, we demonstrate that non-additive, dynamic effects embedded in mrna expression may play an essential role in defining the odds of a complex phenotype. focusing on myocardial infarction , we select a well-defined, small number of gwas-derived candidate genes to probe mechanisms inaccessible on a genome-wide scale. using whole blood expression arrays from the catheterization genetics study  and the framingham heart study , we test the association of rna expression profiles with mi. we focus first on individual genes and then expand to consider non-linear interaction terms between pairs of candidate genes.

analysis of differential co-expression between rnas can enhance our understanding of how dynamic feedback mechanisms between pairs and defined networks of mrnas determine disease risk . gene networks can be extracted from existing databases, . however, most databases are generated from mining previously published literature and are thus biased towards those pathways most studied and often neglect tissue specificity and other nuances of gene-gene interactions.

a comprehensive approach to tissue-specific gene-gene interactions, termed netwas was recently published  <cit> . netwas uses bayesian classification based on a vast database of prior knowledge and integration of open-access expression datasets to define tissue-specific interactions. the results confirm the role of well-established genes in select pathways and include novel discoveries. however, with use of linear measures of association and an additive model thresholded by the effects of individual genes, crucial information on dynamic interactions remains hidden. in contrast, the present study focuses on expression patterns to test dynamic interactions relevant to disease. the approach does not quantify the biological likelihood of any interaction based on prior knowledge, but rather evaluates how non-additive effects change the association between mrna expression and odds of disease risk.

despite progress in the field of network biology, existing methods do not fully account for variability in co-expression across individuals with different genetic and environmental backgrounds, even in those cases where the underlying method is tailored to detect non-linear dependency patterns. to overcome this limitation, we employ a resampling procedure that generates a quantitative measure of the stability of co-expression across individuals.

thus, to inform study non-linear pairwise interactions associated with mi, we construct small-scale, tissue specific co-expression networks with candidate genes in healthy individuals using data from blood and tibial artery in gtex. analysis of blood profiles supports biomarker discovery, and artery, as the site of atherosclerotic plaque formation characteristic of cad, captures disease-relevant physiology. we hypothesize that the relevance of a non-linear interaction for disease will be reflected by a difference in both the strength and variability of co-expression between cases and controls, rather than a binary  switch in co-expression. accordingly, we expect connections between genes in the co-expression network to be the same in both diseased and healthy individuals but their strength and variability to change between those with and without mi.

non-linear interactions between candidate genes associated with mi are unlikely to represent direct, physical interactions between mrnas but rather distinct biological processes that are coordinately regulated. thus, we expand co-expression networks beyond candidate genes to identify additional mrnas that may serve to mediate the observed interactions.

RESULTS
differentially expressed individual candidate genes and their interactions in myocardial infarction 
we analyzed rna profiles  from cathgen and the framingham heart study in subjects with and without a history of mi. focusing on established candidate genes, we searched for:  individual of mrna transcripts and  interactions between mrna transcripts, significantly associated with mi status, noting those that replicate between the two cohorts.

gwas based candidate genes in mi
the cad genome wide association study performed by the cardiogramplusc4d consortium published in  <dig>  including > <dig>  cases and  <dig>  controls, identified  <dig> loci associated with myocardial infarction and cad at genome-wide significance   <cit> . forty-one of the candidate genes assigned to these loci had one or more corresponding probes on expression arrays used in both cathgen  and the framingham heart study . all probes corresponding to these genes were tested for an association between expression and mi using logistic regression.

expression of individual candidate genes in mi
the approach for detecting differentially expressed rnas was designed for each study separately as cathgen and fhs include different proportions of cases/controls, levels of relatedness, and racial diversity.

cathgen
we measured the association between expression of each individual probe, assigned to the  <dig> candidate genes, and mi status using logistic regression with age, race, and gender as additional covariates in the model . we identified  <dig> candidate genes with at least one probe displaying expression levels nominally  associated with mi: pemt, rai <dig>  lpal <dig>  pdgfd, fes, zc3hc <dig>  phactr <dig>  cnnm <dig>  gucy1a <dig>  ube2z, mras, furin, il6r, mia <dig> .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed candidate genes in mi. a cathgen. p-value of association between expression of probe id  and mi status from logistic regression with age, race, and gender as additional covariates. genes with p-value less than  <dig>  are colored in red. b framingham heart study. number of resamples  in which mrna expression of gwas-based candidate gene was significantly associated with mi  in conditional logistic regression model. controls were matched to cases on age, gender, and belonging to a different family. trib <dig>  vamp <dig>  fes, phactr <dig>  zeb <dig>  nt5c <dig>  and smg <dig>  had expression profiles strongly associated with mi . c histograms of p-values for genes determined as significant in cathgen that did not meet the criteria for being associated with mi in fhs. furin, il6r, rai <dig>  and ube2z were informative of mi based on right-skewed histogram. d venn diagram displaying overlap between genes individually significant in cathgen and the framingham heart study

framingham heart study
as a population-based cohort, fhs had a significantly smaller prevalence of mi; accordingly we used a matched case–control design. mi cases with expression data available  were matched to controls  by age, gender, and different family assignment. to assess the robustness of association between mrna levels and mi status, conditional logistic regression analysis was performed  <dig> times, each time on a different random set of matched controls. we identified eight candidate genes displaying expression levels nominally  associated with mi in half or more of the  <dig> resamples : trib <dig>  vamp <dig>  fes, phactr <dig>  zeb <dig>  nt5c <dig>  flt <dig>  and smg <dig> , with phactr <dig> and fes replicating from cathgen.

our resampling approach results in a distribution of main effects and p-values that reflects the biological and environmental diversity of cases and controls. we evaluated these distributions in fhs for all genes significant in cathgen. with a right-skewed distribution, probes in furin, il6r, rai <dig>  and ube2z were considered to be informative of mi . with approximately uniformly distributed p-values, probes in cnnm <dig>  gucy1a <dig>  mras, mia <dig>  pdgfd, pemt, and lpal <dig> did not show evidence of differential expression with mi in fhs . uncertainty in correctly assigning differentially expressed genes indicates that single mrna expression profiles in peripheral blood are only moderately informative of mi status but still can serve as a basis for further analysis.

pairs of interacting candidate genes
expression of candidate gene pairs in mi
in addition to searching for individual differentially expressed genes, we considered pairs of mrnas with and without an interaction term in the model. the expression profiles of mrna pairs were evaluated for association with mi, using the same approach applied to individual mrna expression levels in cathgen and in framingham.

cathgen
considering an additive logistic model  ~ rna1 + rna2 + additional covariates) revealed  <dig>  pairs of probes with both rna terms as significant  and  <dig> with only one rna term as significant in the model . these  <dig> pairs of probes include only  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate genes. applying the same criterion of significance to an interactive model  ~ rna1 + rna2 + rna1*rna2 + additional covariates) revealed  <dig>  pairs of probes with both rna terms as significant  and  <dig> with only one rna term as significant. these  <dig> pairs include  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate genes. we find an interaction model reveals fewer pairs of rnas that are comprised of a more diverse set of genes .table  <dig> comparison of additive models with and without non-linear interactions between candidate gene pairs in cathgen

we define a pair of rnas to be interacting non-linearly if we detect a statistically significant  interaction term in the logistic model for this pair . by this definition, we found  <dig>  pairs of probes defined as interacting in cathgen. these probe pairs represent  <dig> gene pairs that include nearly all of the candidate genes  .

framingham heart study
as before, we performed conditional logistic regression  <dig> times on different sets of matched cases and controls, and recorded the number of times each term in the model was significant . we analyzed both the additive model accounting for mi with expression of gene a and b  and the model with an additional interaction term . we identified  <dig> of  <dig> possible pairs with strong evidence of a non-linear interaction between the two candidate genes : cnnm2|gucy1a <dig>  cnnm2|pemt, cnmm2|zeb <dig>  il6r|lpal <dig>  mia3|slc22a <dig>  mia3|zc3hc <dig>  for each of these six pairs, adding the interaction term to the model greatly decreased the median p-values for all terms in the model, suggesting a functionally significant dynamic interaction in the context of mi . two pairs: cnnm2|gucy1a <dig> and cnnm2|zeb <dig> were also observed in cathgen.table  <dig> interactions between candidate gene pairs in the framingham heart study

of the genes forming these six pairs, only zeb <dig> and il6r were also significant by themselves . the others were not differentially expressed in the framingham heart study, but  <dig> of the remaining  <dig>  were differentially expressed in cathgen as individual rnas. detectable overlap between cathgen and fhs supports the finding of non-linear interactions relevant for mi.

mi-relevance of non-linear interacting mrna pairs
we further investigated how these non-linear rna interactions affect the odds of mi by generating sample distributions of effect sizes based on the resampling procedure used in the fhs. for the two pairs that replicated between cathgen and fhs  we used the distributions of effect sizes to calculate the odds ratio of mi given that the expression of gene a increases by one standard deviation as a function of expression of gene b . in both cases we observe that the expression of one gene  appears protective when expression of the other  is low and deleterious when it is high . the relevance of these non-linear interactions in accounting for mi status is reflected by both:  the reproducibility of the odds ratio curve between different replicates , and  the saddle surface of the expression versus log-odds 3d plot . in fig. 2a, a histogram of gene expression across the population is presented to further assess the utility of this rna as a biomarker of mi. we observe strongly protective or deleterious mrna-mrna ratios in a limited portion of the overall population; nevertheless, the use of multiple gene-gene pairs has potential utility in biomarker panels. the question remains of how these pairs relate to one another.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed candidate gene pairs in mi. nodes are genes and edges reflect significant non-linear interactions defined by logistic models . pink nodes indicate genes that are individually significant , red lines indicate gene pairs that are co-expressed , dotted lines indicate gene pairs that were not tested for co-expression due to poor expression of one or more of the genes, bolded edges indicate non-linear interactions identified in both cohorts . a cathgen. connected graph formed by pairs of genes with a significant interaction term in cathgen using a logistic model  ~ rna1 + rna2 + rna1*rna2 + additional covariates). b framingham heart study. disconnected graphs formed by pairs of genes exhibiting statistically significant interaction terms in fhs, defined by means of the bootstrapped conditional logistic regression  ~ rna1 + rna2 + rna1*rna2) with  <dig> repetitions and matching procedure the same as for individual genes

connectivity between non-linear interacting pairs
we investigate the relationship between pairs of non-linearly interacting rnas by presenting them as a graph of interactions. pairs with significant interaction terms form a connected graph, which is denser for cathgen than framingham, likely because of the larger number of cases in cathgen . the high connectivity of the graph of non-linearly interacting rnas supports the hypothesis that complex phenotypes arise as a destabilization of feedback within a dense molecular network. the six pairs in fhs do not form a densely connected graph, but do indicate interactions between genes only indirectly connected in the cathgen network .

it appears that the selected  <dig> candidate genes are informative but support only sparsely populated physiological networks. therefore, we proceeded to co-expression analysis to both assess the biological plausibility that these genes are co-regulated and incorporate additional rnas that could serve as linkers  between the  <dig> candidate genes.

co-expression of candidate genes and inclusion of additional genes complementing sparse networks
co-expression patterns among  <dig> candidate genes
we used co-expression in healthy individuals to assess the biological plausibility of non-linear interactions associated with disease by building small co-expression networks for the  <dig> candidate genes using gtex rnasequencing data from ‘healthy’ individuals in whole blood  and arteries . .

network construction procedure
our algorithm is designed to evaluate the stability of co-expression between pairs of rnas, rather than the strength of the co-expression per se. similar to the aracne procedure our method uses an information-theoretic divergence measure  to detect ‘direct’ non-linear dependencies between expression profiles  <cit> . to quantify the stability of ‘dynamically co-expressed’ pairs, we generate networks on multiple  random subsamples of individuals and create a consensus network where weights on the edges between mrnas are defined by the proportion of subsamples where the two mrna transcripts are observed as co-expressed . 50 % of all possible pairs are observed in at least one of the  <dig>  resamples. for further analysis, we focus on those observed in at least half of the  <dig>  resamples, representing only 1 % of all possible pairs .

disease interactions and co-expressions
twelve  of the  <dig> non-linearly interacting pairs in cathgen were co-expressed in artery and  <dig>  in blood, indicating the potential for coordinated regulation of these mrnas . those gene pairs that were co-expressed in blood were more likely to demonstrate non-linear interactions associated with mi as manifested by a greater specificity in mi prediction among co-expressed pairs . one of the non-linear interacting pairs detected in both cathgen and fhs  was found to be dynamically co-expressed in both artery and blood . cnnm2|gucy1a <dig> was co-expressed in 51 % of the  <dig>  resamples in artery and 53 % in blood. these results suggest co-expression patterns determined in healthy individuals are also relevant for disease.

co-expression patterns among candidate genes in networks including additional gene transcripts
underlying physiologic mechanisms linking gene expression and mi are indirectly reflected in the sparse networks. to overcome the limitations of these sparse networks, we built large-scale co-expression networks around the  <dig> candidate genes using  <dig>  additional transcripts. at this scale, we expect to observe more biologically credible connections than in a small co-expression network limited to candidate genes. none of the candidate genes were directly co-expressed in these larger networks, indicating that these represent biological processes that are co-regulated but not necessarily in the same pathway. our analysis revealed indirect connections, i.e., ‘relay’ transcripts that serve to connect candidate genes. figure  <dig> displays the shortest paths in blood between a robust pair of candidate mrnas that interacts in the context of disease: cnnm2|gucy1a <dig> fig.  <dig> shortest paths between candidate genes in large-scale co-expression network. five shortest paths between cnnm <dig> and gucy1a <dig> in co-expression network built using ~ <dig>  transcripts in artery. nodes  labeled in pink and edges  labeled in red are significant in a cathgen based logistic model explaining mi by expression of each gene in the path and each pairwise interaction term along the path  ~ rna1 + rna2 + rna3 + rna1* rna2 + rna <dig> * rna3 + additional covariates)



we evaluate the disease relevance of these intermediary co-expressions by considering a logistic model in cathgen with all individual rnas and pairwise non-linear interactions defined by this path in the large-scale network. in the five shortest paths between cnnm <dig> and gucy1a <dig>  we find four individual genes , and five interactions  associated with mi. these links between candidate genes serve as additional candidate genes and interactions.

testing for epistasis in non-linear interacting candidate gene pairs
having identified pairwise interactions significant for mi on the rna level, we asked whether similar interactions occur between snps in candidate genes . using the framingham heart study, we applied the same approach of resampled conditional logistic regression used for rna interactions. for the  <dig> candidate genes that were either differentially expressed or formed an interacting pair in the framingham heart study, we considered all possible pairwise interactions between candidate snps  in the  <dig> genes. this approach yielded several examples with evidence of epistasis , but no evidence for an epistatic interaction between variants in those pairs of genes that exhibited an interaction on the rna level. non-linear interactions at the genotype level may be less robust than those observed at the level of rna expression which integrates both genetic and non-genetic factors.

mi candidate genes also associated with hypercholesterolemia
we performed an identical analysis of single rnas and rna pairs in cathgen using a related trait, hypercholesterolemia . six individual genes  and  <dig> gene pairs with significant interaction terms in the logistic model were associated with hypercholesterolemia . the number of mi-based candidate genes differentially expressed in hypercholesterolemia is lower than in mi, and most genes identified for the two traits are different. three individual genes  and  <dig> gene pairs overlap between mi and hypercholesterolemia . given hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for mi this expected overlap suggests that these individual genes and gene pairs relate to mi through lipid metabolism.

discussion
the goal of this study was to find mrna expression patterns  associated with myocardial infarction. comparison of mrna profiles in blood from healthy controls and mi cases served to identify  <dig> differentially expressed candidate genes and  <dig> non-linear interactions, while co-expression networks in blood and artery from healthy individuals in gtex supported  <dig> of these interactions and brought in additional rnas connecting potential candidate genes. the results support a role for non-additive dynamic interactions between candidate genes in mi.

mrna expression guides interpretation of gwas-based candidate genes
as an intermediate phenotype, gene expression can guide interpretation of gwas findings  <cit> . focusing on mrna expression of gwas based candidate genes, we identified  <dig> individual rnas differentially expressed in mi. fes, furin, phactr <dig>  il6r, rai <dig>  and ube2z were significant in both cathgen and fhs while pdgfd, trib <dig>  rai <dig>  ldlr, ggcx, and slc22a <dig> had been identified previously in the literature as differentially expressed . the same approach applied to hypercholesterolemia identified three genes also associated with mi: mia <dig>  cnnm <dig>  and trib1; suggesting their role in mi could be mediated through lipid metabolism. in a study of expression profiles in lcls and b cells treated with statins, trib <dig> along with seven other genes , differentially expressed only in mi in our study, also exhibit differential expression upon statin exposure , and therefore, may play a role in response to statin therapy  <cit> .

pairs of mrnas contain information relevant to mi and are biologically plausible
previous analyses of differential expression have focused on individual genes as the basis for assigning pathways or networks. with the hypothesis that coronary artery disease results from disrupted interactions between gene products, we considered pairwise non-linear interactions between candidate mrnas. we identified multiple pairs with interaction terms associated with mi, two of which replicated across cohorts: cnnm2|gucy1a <dig> and cnnm2|zeb <dig>  disease related changes of the dynamic interactions between these mrna pairs identifies robust odds ratios for mi. supporting a role of non-linear interactions in logistic models of disease risk, the log odds is not a monotone function of mrna expression. shown in fig.  <dig>  when expression of gucy1a <dig> is high, increasing expression of cnnm <dig> associates with risk, whereas when expression of gucy1a <dig> is low, increasing expression of cnnm <dig> is protective, potentially with high predictive power. therefore, dynamic interaction terms reveal otherwise hidden higher-order relationships between candidate genes. this emphasizes the potential utility of pairwise interactions between mrna expression profiles as a biomarker for disease.

since in addition to the non-linear interaction, we find cnnm <dig> and gucy1a <dig> co-expressed in small-scale networks in both artery and blood, the question arises about the underlying mechanism that regulates these genes, the disruption of which may lead to mi. a physiologic connection between cnnm <dig> and gucy1a <dig> indeed reveals disease relevant processes. a mg2+ transporter, cnnm <dig> interacts in the context of mi with gucy1a <dig>  a mg2+ dependent guanylate cyclase responsive to nitric oxide. mutations in cnnm <dig> have been implicated in familial hypomagnesemia with symptoms including cardiac arrhythmias  <cit> , while common variants of uncertain functions in gucy1a <dig> have been implicated in hypertension by gwas, and rare non-synonymous variants in disorders of vascular tone and myocardial infarction . furthermore, transient hypomagnesemia has been reported in acute mi with vasospasm as a proposed mechanism  <cit> . we suggest imbalanced mrna expression of cnnm <dig> predisposes individuals to hypo- or hypermagnesemia, which could magnify the effect of genetic variants altering gucy1a <dig> expression, either directly or via intermediate mrnas, to generate conditions that favor mi.

the relationship between these two genes and mg2+ is further maintained in one of the shortest paths between the two in a larger co-expression network. the path cnnm2|acsl5|scarf1|gucy1a <dig> appears to be united by the common themes of magnesium and lipid processing. acsl <dig> binds magnesium ions and activates long-chain fatty acids, while scarf <dig> acts as a scavenger receptor to regulate uptake of modified ldl – levels of which are decreased in the presence of magnesium  <cit> . in addition to observing an association between cnnm <dig> and gucy1a <dig> individually with mi, the interaction term between cnnm <dig> and acsl <dig> is also significant  indicating that relationships determined by co-expression patterns in healthy individuals can be informative of disease.

co-expression in healthy individuals of the same pair of genes that exhibit a non-linear interaction associated with disease supports the biological plausibility of the pair. in this study, 20 % of rna pairs with non-linear interactions associated with disease are also co-expressed in healthy subjects, indicating co-expression may serve as an additional criterion to prioritize significant interactions. we have identified disease-associated dynamic interactions between mrna transcripts of strong candidate genes, gleaned from expression profiles in whole blood and recapitulated by co-expression in artery. the results support the notion that rna profiles in blood can reveal disease-relevant processes in the tissue of interest.

evidence for disrupted network structure in mi
non-linear pairwise interactions associated with mi form a well-connected graph that includes virtually all candidate genes, suggesting that relevant information about disease is dispersed across a broad network. we propose that there is a fundamental difference in detecting genes involved in mi pathophysiology by considering an additive versus a non-linear effect. defining pairs based on an additive  model reduces the number of genes included in the network by half, whereas non-linear interactions appear better to capture disease risk and may prove useful in accounting for genetic factors related to complex diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
considering pairwise interactions between candidate genes reveals strong, disease-relevant pairs – a possible entry point for broad study of mi systems biology. our results further demonstrate that mrna expression profiles encoded by a limited number of candidate genes yields sparse interacting networks. serving as an anchor to extend the analysis genome-wide, we then searched for relay genes in larger networks, confirming additional candidate genes and identifying novel ones. additional work is needed to elucidate higher order interactions and further assess potential utility of the dynamic interactions observed here in clinical biomarker panels.
