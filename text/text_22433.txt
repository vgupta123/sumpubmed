BACKGROUND
microbial degradation of the major industrial solvent and polymer synthesis monomer styrene has been the focus of intense academic investigation for over  <dig> decades, most notably in the genus pseudomonas. as a result, a significant body of knowledge has been established regarding the key enzymatic steps as well as the organisation, regulation and taxonomic distribution of the catabolic genes involved  <cit> . in pseudomonas species studied to date, styrene degradation involves an initial "upper pathway", composed of genes encoding the enzymes for styrene catabolism to phenylacetic acid. the upper pathway is regulated by a two component sensor kinase and response regulator system, stysr, which activates transcription of the catabolic genes in response to the presence of styrene, figure  <dig>   <cit> . the intermediate, phenylacetic acid, subsequently undergoes an atypical aerobic step of co-enzyme a activation to yield phenylacetyl coa , which binds to and deactivates a gntr-type negative regulator, paax, enabling transcription of the pacoa catabolon. this pathway facilitates the degradation of pacoa to succinyl-coa and acetyl coa, figure  <dig>   <cit> . the pacoa catabolon was originally identified and characterised in e. coli w and p. putida u, and has since been found to be widely dispersed among microbial species as one of the four key metabolic routes for microbial, aromatic compound degradation  <cit> . thus, while styrene degradation is dependent on the presence of pacoa catabolon genes for complete substrate mineralisation, the pacoa catabolon is commonly identified independently of the sty operon genes. indeed, in pseudomonas sp. y <dig> the presence of two, functional pacoa catabolons has been reported, only one of which is linked with the styrene degradation pathway genes. the distinct genetic divergence and gene organisation patterns of these catabolons suggest disparate evolutionary origins,  <cit> . in relation to the identification and characterisation of styrene linked pacoa catabolons, several strain specific traits have been reported in pseudomonas species studied to date. comparative analyses of sty gene sequences from pseudomonas putida ca- <dig>  pseudomonas fluorescens st, pseudomonas species y <dig> and pseudomonas sp vlb <dig> reveal a high degree of similarity in terms of percentage identity and structural organisation,  <cit> . however, functional characterisations in p. putida ca- <dig> and p. fluorescens st have identified different regulatory profiles in relation to catabolite repression inducing carbon sources and nutrient limitation exposure  <cit> . with respect to the pacoa catabolon, an essential phenylacetic acid uptake mechanism has previously been characterised in pseudomonas putida u, co-ordinately expressed with the catabolic genes  <cit> . in contrast, a recent proteomic analysis of styrene grown p. putida ca- <dig> cells indicated that phenylacetic acid transport gene products were not detected in styrene grown ca- <dig>  despite the expression of all other pacoa catabolon proteins  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis of pacoa catabolon gene organisation in  <dig> microbial genomes revealed repeated de novo clustering of the catabolic genes  <cit> . however, the authors suggested that recombination events and in situ gene replacements by interspecies gene transfer had produced considerable diversity in both gene composition and operonic organisation in the pathways. in light of these findings the question arises as to whether the conserved catabolic function of the pacoa catabolon is subject to varied, host dependent regulatory influences in differing species. elucidation of such host regulatory influences may identify key flux control points for recombinant strain engineering strategies to optimise biotechnological outputs related to the pathways  <cit> . in this study the pseudomonas putida ca- <dig> genome was randomly mutagenised with a mini-tn <dig> transposon and isolates screened for altered styrene and phenylacetic acid utilisation phenotypes in an effort to identify key regulatory influences acting on these catabolic pathways in this strain.

RESULTS
random tn <dig> mutant library screening and characterisation
approximately  <dig>   <dig> transconjugants displaying mini-tn <dig> dependent kanamycin resistance were generated in the study. eight of these isolates were found to grow poorly, or not at all, on phenylacetic acid as a sole carbon source in  <dig> well plates with liquid minimal salts media, . subsequent attempts to cultivate these eight isolates on similar media with styrene as a sole carbon source revealed only one mutant as being capable of growth, d <dig>  achieving wild type biomass levels after a  <dig> hour period, figure  <dig>  the ability of d <dig> to grow on styrene indicated that catabolism of the phenylacetic acid intermediate was functional in this mutant. indeed, subsequent assays of a key enzyme in the process, phenylacetyl-coa  ligase, revealed almost identical activities in styrene grown wild type and d <dig> mutant cells, . however, d <dig> failed to grow when inoculated into liquid minimal salts media with phenylacetic acid as the sole carbon source, figure  <dig>  the ability of d <dig> to grow on styrene, , but not on extracellular phenylacetic acid as supplied in the media, suggested the potential mini-tn <dig> disruption of a gene involved in phenylacetic acid uptake. growth of d <dig> on a non catabolon related substrate, citrate, produced a similar profile to growth on styrene, figure  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting core metabolism was intact.

identification and complementation of the rpon gene disruption
the insertion site of the mini-tn <dig> transposon was mapped using two consecutive rounds of arbitrary pcr and the resulting amplicons sequenced and analysed using the genbank, blastn algorithm. the chromosomal region immediately downstream of the tn <dig> insertion displayed over 98% sequence similarity to rpon genes from other p. putida strains, suggesting the gene was disrupted in mutant d <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of the full gene was subsequently generated and submitted to genbank under the accession number hm <dig>  in p. putida kt <dig> the rpon gene forms part of an operon with  <dig> putative downstream genes encoding members of the phosphotransferase system, including ptsn and ptso  <cit> . while such an operonic structure has not been demonstrated for p. putida ca- <dig>  the possibility existed that the observed phenylacetic acid negative phenotype of the d <dig> mutant may in fact have been as a result of downstream pleiotropic effects of the tn <dig> insertion in rpon. however, complementation of the disrupted rpon with the cloned, full length wild type gene, , was found to completely restore the strain's ability to grow on styrene and phenylacetic acid, respectively, figure  <dig> and  <dig>  thus a σ <dig> deficiency in d <dig> appeared to be the primary factor responsible for the loss of phenylacetic acid utilisation in this strain. control experiments with p. putida ca- <dig> wild type and d <dig> strains carrying the pbbr1mcs- <dig> expression vector without insert, revealed that the growth profiles presented in figure  <dig> were not affected by plasmid maintenance demands or antibiotic presence in the respective media, .

rt-pcr of pacoa catabolon genes in wild type p. putida ca- <dig> and rpon disrupted d <dig> mutant strains
despite a wealth of available sequence data on the diverse taxonomic distribution and genetic organisation of the pacoa catabolon genes, an extensive review of the existing literature by the authors failed to uncover any prior association between σ <dig> factors and functional promoters of the pacoa catabolon. alonso et al previously proposed  <dig> putative operons within the pacoa catabolon in pseudomonas sp. strain y <dig>  associated with the genes for ring hydroxylation, β-oxidation like conversions and phenylacetic acid transport, respectively  <cit> . rpon dependent transcriptional regulation was not proposed in the study. representative gene targets from these proposed operons were therefore selected for analysis of substrate dependent, transcriptional activation in wild type p. putida ca- <dig> and d <dig> mutant strains. the target genes selected encoded the pacoa ligase, , an epoxidase subunit  <dig>  , and the phenylacetate permease, . figure  <dig> presents a composite image of rt-pcr results, necessitated by the similarity in target gene product sizes. however, the profiles presented accurately reflect those of the individual gels, and take account of variation in contrast levels. transcriptional activation of the paaf and paag genes was readily detected following growth of wild type p. putida ca- <dig> on styrene or phenylacetic acid, while the rt-pcr product for paal was markedly weaker, figure  <dig>  rt-pcr analysis of d <dig> mutant strains grown on styrene produced paaf and paag transcript profiles similar to wild type cells, however, paal transcripts were not detectable in the mutant, figure  <dig>  the authors note that nikodinovic et al did not detect the presence of paal in a recent proteomic analysis of styrene grown p. putida ca- <dig> cells,  <cit> . however, the stirred tank reactor growth conditions employed, with continuous feeding of nh4cl to maintain a concentration above  <dig> mg/l, differed significantly from the batch studies conducted in this investigation. the authors have previously published findings on the significant impact growth conditions can have on the transcriptional regulation of catabolon genes, particularly as inorganic nutrient limitations arise,  <cit> . it is possible therefore that the low level transcription of paal reported here during styrene growth may reflect growth conditions not encountered in the proteomic study. 16s rrna gene rt-pcr indicated equivalent levels of cdna synthesis in each of the samples. rt-pcr analyses of citrate grown wild type and d <dig> strains acted as negative controls. to date, the only functional characterisation of phenylacetic acid uptake to have been conducted in pseudomonas was performed with p. putida u  <cit> . in this strain the paal permease and paam membrane proteins were both reported as essential for phenylacetic acid utilisation and were co-ordinately regulated with transcriptional activation of the other  <dig> catabolic operons. however, the transcriptional profiling presented in figure  <dig>  provided preliminary evidence that paal may be differentially regulated in p. putida ca- <dig>  in a σ <dig> dependent manner. the potential for divergent regulatory mechanisms to influence transport in different microbial species is perhaps not surprising however, given that the phenylacetic acid transport system is inconsistently reported in the literature. the paam gene is frequently absent from pacoa catabolons reported in pseudomonas species  <cit>  while both paal and paam are absent from the pacoa catabolon of e. coli w  <cit> . the authors were unable to identify any paam homologue in p. putida ca- <dig> during this study.

over-expression of paal in wild type p. putida ca- <dig> and rpon disrupted d <dig> mutant strains
to confirm whether the observed paal gene transcription deficiency was the major contributory factor in the phenylacetic acid negative phenotype of mutant d <dig>  over expression experiments were conducted. the full length  <dig>   <dig> kb paal gene was amplified from p. putida ca- <dig> and sequenced, . the gene was subsequently cloned into the pbbr1mcs- <dig> expression vector and conjugally transferred into the d <dig> mutant to give d7-paal+. constitutive expression of paal from the pbbr1mcs- <dig> vector was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis following growth of the host cells on citrate, . growth of d7-paal+ on phenylacetic acid was subsequently assessed, with a complete restoration in substrate utilisation by the mutant being observed, figure  <dig>  thus, paal plays a key role in phenylacetic acid utilisation in p. putida ca- <dig> and rpon dependent regulation appears unique to the transport operon within the pacoa catabolon of this strain. interestingly, previous work by jurado et al  <cit>  reported that σ <dig> levels in p. putida remain relatively constant throughout growth, ~ <dig> ±  <dig> molecules per cell, which barely exceeds the number of genome predicted σ <dig> dependent promoters in p. putida kt <dig>  the possibility existed therefore that limited σ <dig> availability imparted stringent transcriptional control of the transport mechanism in p. putida ca- <dig>  effectively creating a rate limiting step in substrate use. indeed, previous work by our group demonstrated that over expression of the styrene active transport protein, stye, in p. putida ca- <dig> resulted in an  <dig> fold increase in transcriptional activation of the upper pathway  <cit> . the paal expression vector was therefore conjugally transferred into wild type cells to give wt-paal+, and growth on phenylacetic acid and pacoa ligase activity assessed. surprisingly, the observed effect of paal over expression in the wt-paal+ strain was slower growth on phenylacetic acid compared with the p. putida ca- <dig> parent and d7-paal+ strains, figure  <dig>  in addition, pacoa ligase activity was found to be approximately 22% lower in the wt-paal+ strain compared with wild type p. putida ca- <dig> . it remains unclear whether the reduced activity observed reflects a direct inhibitory impact on the ligase enzyme, or a general toxicity effect within the cells arising from paal over-expression and increased phenylacetic acid uptake. thus, while paal expression is essential for phenylacetic acid utilisation by p. putida ca- <dig>  it does not appear to represent a rate limiting step in the process.

cloning and bioinformatic analysis of the paal promoter from p. putida ca-3
the paal promoter region was cloned from p. putida ca- <dig>  sequenced and analysed for archetypal σ <dig> promoter features, figure  <dig> and  <dig> <cit> . analysis of the  <dig> bp promoter sequence using the search algorithms genomematscan and tres, failed to identify palindromic or inverted repeat regions, typical of xylr/ntrc family enhancer binding proteins,   <cit> . ebps are reportedly essential for transcriptional activation of σ <dig> promoters and facilitate the integration of promoter activation with host signal responses to environmental cues and physiological states,  <cit> . comparative analysis of the paal promoter with  <dig> other predicted σ <dig> promoter sequences from p. putida kt <dig>  was carried out using the multiple em for motif elucidation algorithm, meme  <cit> . the program quantitatively evaluates background noise in similarly regulated promoters to identify the most conserved motifs among them as potential sites for regulator interactions. one highly conserved motif was identified as common to all sequences, which was identified via the tomtom motif comparison tool  <cit>  as a σ <dig> binding site. the site contained the previously reported gg-n10-gc,-24/- <dig> consensus sequence found in all σ <dig> promoters  <cit> . virtual footprint, which scans for known regulator motifs from the prodoric database  <cit>  also identified an imperfect integration host factor  binding site at nucleotide  <dig>  figure  <dig>  however, this site overlaps the meme predicted σ <dig> site, prompting the authors to screen for alternative σ <dig> binding regions. subsequent analysis of the promoter using the promscan algorithm, with a cut off score of  <dig> , identified a second σ <dig> consensus site at nucleotide position  <dig>  the proximal location of this site to the proposed ggagg shine dalgarno ribosome binding sequence at nucleotide position  <dig> was more consistent with conventional σ <dig> promoter architecture, figure  <dig>  primer extension analysis of rna extracts from phenylacetic acid grown p. putida ca- <dig> confirmed the transcriptional start site at nucleotide  <dig>  upon sequencing of the 5' race pcr product, figure  <dig> and  <dig> 

relative sequence identities of paal genes and promoters from diverse pseudomonas species
clustal w analysis was performed with paal genes and promoters from available pacoa catabolon host genomes, , and styrene degradation associated paal genes from p. putida ca- <dig>  y <dig> and p. fluorescens st, . the analysis revealed greater diversity occurred in promoter sequences than in gene sequences. this is clearly demonstrated among the paal genes from the styrene degraders p. fluorescens st, p. putida ca- <dig> and pseudomonas sp. y <dig>  which all share > 80% sequence identity with kt <dig> paal sequence, but less than 16% identity at the respective promoter level, table  <dig>  among the three styrene degrading strains the authors note that the paal promoters are 100% identical, while the catabolic genes share ~97% sequence identity, table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this is the first study to report σ <dig> dependent regulation of paal expression in phenylacetic acid utilisation by a pseudomonas species. since other groups have previously suggested σ <dig> dependent regulation of the transport system,  <cit>  we questioned whether such regulation might be unique to p. putida ca- <dig>  or have a potentially broader significance in the field of styrene/phenylacetic acid microbial catabolism. our analyses of the genetic diversity of paal genes and promoters suggest that a relatively recent recombination event involving de novo clustering of paa genes  <cit>  with the sty operon may have occurred. in this scenario, incorporation of the σ <dig> dependent regulation of paal may have been an arbitrary event, following the "black cat/white cat" random promoter association model proposed by cases and de lorenzo in relation to novel catabolic pathways  <cit> . however, irrespective of the origins of σ <dig> regulation of paal, the identical promoter structures suggest that biotechnological applications targeting this pathway should consider the potential for a functional role of σ <dig> dependent regulation in phenylacetic acid assimilation by these strains.
