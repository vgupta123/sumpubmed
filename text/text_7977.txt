BACKGROUND
the large family of nuclear receptors  comprise regulatory transcription factors that are activated by specific ligands  and regulate a wide range of biological processes in metazoa, and the association of many of them to human diseases make them a current major drug target <cit> . the overall architecture of nrs consists of an n-terminal region , a dna binding domain , a molecular hinge , a ligand binding domain  and a c-terminal region . given the functional importance of the lbd  and the dbd , they are the most conserved domains and are easily alignable . on the other hand, all other domains are highly variable in size and sequence . there are also nrs lacking lbds  or dbds . more recently, nuclear receptors containing two dbds have also been identified from the flatworm parasite schistosoma mansoni and database mining have detected this architecture not only in other platyhelminthes but also in mollusks and arthropods  <cit> . such studies are possible due to the increasingly high availability of nr sequences - the current pfam  <cit>  release lists  <dig> dbds and  <dig> lbds from and  <dig> and  <dig> species, respectively. for both domains, more than 90% of the available sequences come from nematoda, chordata and arthropoda.

phylogenetic analysis divide nuclear receptors in six classes, named nr1-nr <dig>  plus a seventh class  for the unusual nuclear receptors lacking either the dbd or lbd. nuclear receptors may also be referred to as type i-iv: type i receptors, comprising the nr <dig> subfamily, are cytosolic and ligand binding causes its transport to the nucleus after dissociation from heat shock proteins and homodimerization. type ii receptors, which correspond to the nr <dig> class, are kept in the nucleus, usually binding to dna as heterodimers . they are inactivated by co-repressors in the absence of ligands, which, when present, cause the dissociation from co-repressors and co-activator recruiting. type iii receptors  are similar to type i, the difference relying on the hre sequence . finally, type iv receptors are able to bind to dna as monomers also, and are not restricted to a single class in the nr1-nr <dig> nomenclature.

the caenorhabditis elegans  nematode is a particularly interesting model organism for the study of nuclear receptor evolution, due to the fact that its number of predicted nrs is above  <dig>  75% of them possibly representing functional genes  <cit> . this is the highest number of nr genes ever found in a single species to date, being considerably higher than the amount found in drosophila  and even in humans . the caenorhabditis briggsae species, which also has available sequences, presents such a high amount of potential nuclear receptor genes as well. although abundant, most c. elegans nr genes are difficult to be grouped in the nr1-nr <dig> system, which characterize a distinct event of proliferation and diversification for those receptors, probably from a series of duplications of a hnf <dig> ancestor, an orphan receptor  <cit> . from all known c. elegans nuclear receptors, only seven have well described functions  <cit> .

protein families can be usually identified by well conserved motifs. in the case of nuclear receptors, dbds can be easily detected by the presence of two highly conserved c <dig> zinc finger motifs, while lbds contain a twenty residue long "signature motif" that stabilizes its canonical fold  <cit> . aside from positional conservation, which can define such motifs or detect family-wide functional important residues , another useful way of studying protein families is looking for correlations - i.e., the fact that a given residue in a certain position in a multiple sequence alignment  increases or decreases the chance of observing another residue in another position. quantitatively measuring such correlations was made possible due to the availability of a sufficient number of sequences from a given protein family, and many studies based on correlated mutations have appeared, especially during the nineties, following the seminal article of göbel and co-authors in  <dig>  <cit> . this was followed by other correlation metrics such as mutual information <cit> , statistical coupling analysis <cit> , explicit likelihood  <cit> , etc. statistical coupling analysis have been applied to the study of lbds  <cit> , while the alignable portions of full-length nrs were studied by mutual information  <cit> , which resulted in successfully reporting residues that connect the functionally important surfaces in nuclear receptors  <cit>  and a set of three residues in the dimer interface that uniquely identify nuclear receptors  <cit> . we have previously observed that further analysis of correlated positions in a multiple sequence analysis may reveal class-determining patterns - specifically, residues involved in metal selectivity and oligomeric state in fe/mn-superoxide dismutases  <cit> , while halabi et al. independently detected the existence of "sectors" in protein family multiple sequence analysis that may also evolve independently and be responsible for different functions  <cit> . a new methodology was proposed in order to extract this additionally available and potentially useful information from correlation analysis  <cit>  - specifically, we adopted the independent calculation of residue-specific correlation , so that different class-determining groups are not masked by their potential presence in the same position in a multiple sequence alignment, which would be a limitation for metrics that report interpositional correlation  only. a correlation network where nodes are residue-position pairs  and connections are correlation scores  is built and subsequently decomposed  in order to detect residue groups  that may be related to a class-specific function or characteristic  <cit> . the presence of well-defined functional surfaces, very different modes of action and a remarkable evolutionary history  <cit>  led us to believe that correlation network decomposition could provide useful residue-specific information about the evolution and function of nuclear receptors.

RESULTS
ligand binding domains
although nuclear receptor ligand binding domains have already been studied using correlation analysis  <cit> , new insights can still be found when residue-specific metrics are used. the calculation and subsequent decomposition of the overall correlation network in lbds resulted in four communities . the first one consists of positions ala <dig>  glu <dig>  phe <dig>  leu <dig>  pro <dig> and gln <dig> . glu <dig> is close to the hormone binding site and all human nuclear receptors have an acidic residue in that position except for the steroid receptors and the two nrs lacking a dbd, dax <dig> and shp. the other residues in this community are close to the co-activator binding interface and also present in most human nuclear receptors.

the same is not true for the second community, consisting of residues phe <dig>  gly <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> - whose individual frequencies are among 22-36% among all receptors. with residues  that are in contact with those in the co-activator binding site and also other two which are closer to the hormone binding site , they are not common to most human nuclear receptors, but actually present in specific nrs, possibly due to being involved in ligand specificity: in rar, for example, a mutation in arg <dig>  affects ligand binding and causes resistance to all-trans retinoic acid  <cit> , while in vdr the equivalent arg <dig> is related to vitamin d binding, which turns undetectable upon its mutation to alanine  <cit> . another class-specific characteristic related to residues in this second community is found for arg380: it is involved in a salt bridge which is specific for class ii nuclear receptors  <cit>  - in the case of rarα, for example, the equivalent arg <dig> binds to asp <dig>  in this receptor, residue phe <dig> , is involved in retinoic acid expulsion  <cit> .

the third community presents residues lys <dig>  leu <dig>  trp <dig> and trp <dig>  which are present in about one half of all receptors in our final alignment. positive residues in position  <dig> are found in a buried salt bridge that is present in some nrs , while a leucine in position  <dig>  may be part of the binding site to the metastasis tumor-associated 1estrogen receptor repressor  <cit> . in silico studies  <cit>  suggested that the two tryptophans may be an important part of the estrogen receptor region that could bind polyproline-ii containing proteins . these two tryptophans are extremely high correlated: the presence of a tryptophan in position  <dig> raises the frequency of tryptophans in position  <dig> from  <dig> % to  <dig> % , in agreement with a possible important role for such residues as suggested by jacquot et al.  <cit> .

finally there is a two-residue community consisting of lys <dig> and leu <dig>  present individually in about 40% of the nr sequences. the role of these two residues has been well characterized for vdr. using vdr numbering, lys <dig> is crucial for ligand-dependent transactivation  <cit> , while the mutation of leu <dig> severely impairs its function, with all functions  abolished when leu <dig> is also mutated  <cit> .

dna binding domains
the correlation pattern among dbd residues is shown in figure  <dig>  three sets are distinctly recognized from the figure: the first containing residues f <dig>  r <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  the second containing residues d <dig>  y <dig>  g <dig>  k <dig>  and a third containing residues e <dig>  g <dig>  q <dig> . it is also visible from the network that subset  <dig> antagonizes the other two. therefore, proteins containing the residues in this subset usually will not present the residues listed in the other two, in most cases due simply to different residue options in the same position , but also by an apparent transitivity for asp <dig> and gln <dig>  the 153- <dig> stretch can be directly mapped to a very important functional motif in dna binding domains: the p-box, at the c-terminal region of the recognition helix , which directly interacts with dna and is responsible for half-site specificity . p-boxes in human nuclear receptors usually have a ce153g154ck156g <dig> or similar sequence , except for the 3-ketosteroid class receptors , which present a cg153s154ck156v <dig>  sequence. the two cysteines in those sequences are strictly conserved in all dbds, since they are necessary to bind zinc in the first of the two zinc fingers in this domain. positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the motifs shown above  are called the 1st, 2nd and 3rd p-box positions, and site directed mutagenesis has shown that these three positions act concertedly to discriminate between half-sites on the hres that differ in sequence at the third and fourth base pairs , such that substitutions at one position may alter the functionality of the others  <cit> . one of such studies, using the β isoform of the human thyroid receptor , has demonstrated that, in order to bind with high affinity to everted repeat sequences containing the aggnca hormone response element motif , a glutamate is required in the first p-box position, and also a glycine or alanine in the second one  <cit> . beyond this, the topological context of the hre neighborhood seems to influence the recognition mediated by these three positions. for example, in a similar study with htrβ, the nature of the flanking sequence between the two half-sites  showed itself influence on the lability of 1st, 2nd and 3rd p-box positions  at the recognition of aggnca half-sites  <cit> .

the residues in group  <dig> also includes gln <dig>  which lies on another motif known as distal box or simply d-box, a region in the second zinc finger which is perpendicular to the p-box and mediates dimerization. community  <dig> includes also tyr <dig>  at the β-hairpin on the vicinity of the first zinc finger and making important contacts with the major groove backbone; and d <dig>  at the first zinc finger, facing the dna backbone at the 3' side, as q <dig> . our structural analysis points to an apparent more controversial role for this residue along the dbd evolution - the apparent nature of the correlations found at the  <dig> sets of the dbd correlated analysis are detailed at the next topics.

the dbd's correlation network reflects long range stereochemical adjustments on hre recognition
in order to better understand how the set of correlations recovered here can reflect on dbd functionality, we have analyzed representative structures of dbd:dna complexes from literature, with "canonical" and divergent patterns of hre recognition. in figure  <dig>  a representative structure of the hrxrα-dbd:hre complex  is depicted, and residues contained in the sets  <dig> and  <dig> from the correlation network are shown, among two strongly conserved basic residues at the h-a's n-terminal: k <dig>  and r <dig> . the above cited set of residues and their accompanying protein:dna contacts  comprise the most conserved pattern at these respective positions between the non-3-ketosteroid receptors . the set  <dig> of our correlation analysis, on the other hand, is restricted to a very particular phylogenetic clade, in the nematode caenorhabditis genus, whose apparent effects of its individual components will be gradually discussed later as they appear at some structures analyzed here, and then eventually considered as a whole group.

firstly, considering just the 1st, 2nd and 3rd "canonical" p-box positions at figure  <dig> , it can be noted that just the first one between them make apparent significant and specific hydrogen bonds with the nitrogenous basis at the third basis-pair and have its aliphatic chain in proximity at the fourth basis-pair. such apparent discrepancy is taken off, however, when we consider the adjustments of glycines  <dig> and  <dig> at the hre major groove on a topological context. g <dig> is in close proximity of the dna backbone wall at the 5' extremity of the dna anti-sense strand  and near, but in the opposite face, of the sites where the e <dig> side chain contacts the nitrogenous basis on the major groove . in turn, g <dig> is closely surrounded by the aliphatic side chains of the basic residues k <dig> , k <dig> and r <dig>  from these three, r <dig> is strongly packed over the c <dig> atom of the final anti-sense thymidine and interacts with the phosphate-backbone at the great majority of the nr:hre structures; k <dig> makes a direct saline bond with the already mentioned e <dig> side chain  and hydrogen bonds with the second basis pair at the half-site; while k <dig> makes moderate interactions with nucleotides at the two central basis-pairs. such highly packed system combined with the relatively limited space of the major groove causes stereochemical restrictions over the side chains that can be accommodated at the positions  <dig> and  <dig> in order to maintain the system interactions on their total integrity. on the study of nelson et al.  <cit> , the nature of the substitutions at these positions that were permissive for the recognition of a set of agnnca variants were congruent with stereochemical clash at these sites. the apparent concerted way in which the two p-box glycine residues adapt themselves to the stereochemical ambient at the dbd-major groove complex is also suggested by the anti-correlation between g <dig>  and the g154a substitution , as recovered from our correlation network .

finally, the stereochemical dependence of residues  <dig> and  <dig> for hre recognition is evident when comparing structures of complexes with dbds containing "canonical" p-boxes and structures containing modifications at these positions . both the structure of the heterodimer of htrβ:hrxrα on dr <dig>  and the one of the htrβ homodimer on trepal  present dbds with the archetypical cegckg motif bound to archetypical aggtca half-sites. it can be noted that the previously cited packing pattern for the g <dig>  g <dig> and their respective neighborhood adjust themselves considerably well to the half-sites with a dna axis relatively straight . however, for the homodimer of the estrogen receptor  dbd bound to the ere , the bulkier dbd interface mediated by the two respective d-boxes and the absence of a central t-box contact promotes a bending of the dna axis toward the major groove at the center of the complex . it can be noted that such bent axis causes a relative "slope" of the region of the major groove, at the respective half-sites, where the residue  <dig> pack against the r <dig> and this one against the 5' anti-sense thimidine . nevertheless, such "sloped" major groove is very well fitted by the relatively bulkier a <dig> residue that replaces the g <dig> at these receptors  . it is interesting to note that substitutions at a <dig> for the estrogen receptor has profound effects over the affinity of this receptor to hre sequences in analogy to what occurs upon the substitutions of g <dig> for tr, although these residues, themselves, do not contact directly any nucleotide, confirming the stereochemical topological influence mediated by this position.

modifications of the set  <dig> of the correlation network evidences a role for dbd positional adaptation to dna axis topology
correlations between aberrant substitutions at the positions from the sets  <dig> and  <dig> of the correlation network and hre recognition are also particularly evident at the analysis of the structure of the glucocorticoid receptor interacting with its specific hre  . as it is usual for the 3-ketosteroid receptor subclass, gr presents the pattern cgsckv in its p-box, with substitutions at the three principal positions that significantly modify the stereochemical characteristics of this segment. it is well known that such modifications are accompanied by a change in half-site selectivity, from aggtca to agaaca  <cit> . a less discussed issue, however, is that 3-ketosteroid receptors present also a subclass conserved substitution at residue  <dig> of the d-box, from the usual glutamine recovered in this study at the set  <dig> of the correlation network to a proline residue . such substitution seems to act in concert with the modified p-box at the specific dbd-hre fit .

a first issue to be considered on an agaaca hre sequence is that the placing of the aa central step upstream to a ca step facilitates a local kink, promoting a "depression" of the major groove surface at the region where the recognition helix allocates   <cit> . the bulky side chain of the v <dig> residue projects itself over such kink in a more efficient way than the analogous a <dig> from er. in this way, the v <dig> side chain can pack against the c <dig> methyl group from the anti-sense thimidine of the fourth dinucleotide . the simultaneous bulky substitution of g <dig> by s <dig>  in turn, contributes by sustaining the h-a mass center in the correct position to allow the placing of v <dig> over the kink region, which is necessary due to the larger major groove of the agaaca sequence  <cit> . the q188p substitution, in turn, seems to contribute to the stabilization of such system in two ways. firstly, the reduction of the side chain in contact with the phosphate backbone at this position facilitates the d-box tilting in direction of the dimerization interface with the partner . such tilt is necessary for dimerization, both due to the already mentioned deeper and larger major groove for the agaaca half-site  as to the larger spacer between the two half sites for gre as opposed to ere  . however, a second considerably more interesting movement is allowed by the simultaneous loss of contacts at positions  <dig> and  <dig> from set  <dig> and the gain of contacts at position  <dig> from the same set in gr . it can be noted that, in order to place the v <dig> over the "depression" of the major groove, enhancing the protein:dna contacts and the dimerization between the two dbds, the web of molecular interactions at the gr-gre interface should suffer a small displacement, related to the er:ere complex. such displacement can be defined as being along a diagonal crossing the dna axis and in the direction to the variation on its curvature . this movement is facilitated by the simultaneous loss of the saline contacts between k <dig> and the mutated e153g , the loss of the hydrogen bonds between e <dig> and the anti-sense basis of the third basis-pair and, finally, the shortening of the side chain of the residue  <dig>  in contact with the phosphate backbone. it can be also noted that, in order to draw back electrostatic repulsion with the displaced k <dig>  the k <dig> side chain in gr points outside to the major groove, interacting with the phosphate backbone, as opposed to its analogous in er  that points inside to the same groove . similar modifications are noted at the structure of the androgen receptor  complexed to the 5' half site of the dr3-are  and for pr receptor at pre .

therefore, the structural effects of the substitutions at the positions of set  <dig> in 3-ketosteroid receptor dbds suggest an evolutionary pressure related to the optimization of the correct placing of the domain related to the modified dna principal axis of its hre, in order to maintain satisfactory interactions with the half-site and between monomers. it is interesting to note that such divergent pattern of the set  <dig> and set  <dig>  for keto-steroid receptors does not appear at the correlation scheme found in figure  <dig>  apparently as a direct effect of the evolutionary history of 3-ketosteroid receptors. they are part of the nr <dig> subfamily, which is exclusive to vertebrates, and the current diversity of this subfamily  was the result of duplication and diversification from an ancestral estrogen receptor  <cit> . being much more recent than the receptors containing a cegckg or similar motif, the very high similarity for the dna binding domains of 3-ketosteroid receptors means that, in order to produce a well sampled final alignment, the procedures described in materials and methods remove most of those receptors from the dbd alignment, resulting in only five sequences with a cgsckv motif.

another evidence from literature of the concerted role of the set  <dig> residues on global orientation of the dbd:dna web of interactions can be found at the structure of the less divergent hnf <dig> dbd:hre complex   <cit> . the hnf <dig> nuclear receptor is able to bind, with strong affinity, to an alternative hnf <dig> specific half-site with the 5'-agtcca-3' sequence  <cit> . mutational studies  <cit>  have demonstrated that such divergent selectivity is well correlated with the presence of two non-usual modifications at the hnf <dig> dbd: an e153d substitution  and a not so unusual k161r substitution . in the cited study, the greatest effect on hnf4-specific binding was mediated by the e153d substitution, although the r <dig> presence seems to have an optimizing role. it was also observed that the d153-r <dig> charged pair, in humans, is only found on hnf <dig> dbds. however, a non discussed issue is an even more ubiquitous substitution, at position  <dig> of the set  <dig> for hnf <dig> dbds: a q188r substitution, that is frequently found even on c. elegans, and that when absent in this organism is substituted almost exclusively by another basic k <dig> residue, preserving a considerable part of its physical-chemistry . comparing the set of interactions mediated by these three positions  for canonical and hnf4's dbd:hre interactions we can suggest an integrated role for these three residues at the hnf <dig> positioning on it divergent half-site . figure 6-a-b, depicts, respectively, the structures of the dbd: complexes for hrxrα  and hpparγ , in both cases highlighting the hydrogen bonding distance between the e <dig> residue  and the anti-sense basis for the half-site third pair . also visible is the stacking, in hydrogen bonding position, of the q <dig> residue of these two dbds over the respective dna backbones. finally, the basic residue at the  <dig> position  are both positioned in order to make moderate interactions with the hydrogen bond acceptors on the central basis step , as usual for canonical dbd:hre contacts at this position. on the other hand, on a model based on the structure of the hnf4-dbd complexed with its specific hre  , but with the residues  <dig> and  <dig> manually replaced by their respective e and q canonical constituents , it can be noted the loss of an hydrogen bonding favorable position between e <dig> and the anti-sense third basis, due to the cytidine-adenosine substitution at this site . it can also be noted that r <dig> packs against the sense thymidine, directing the arg shift basis in a downstream sense , drawing back interactions with the third base hydrogen acceptor . such pattern of missing hydrogen bonds is concurrent with the low affinity of dbds containing the canonical e <dig> residue with agtcca half-sites. for a real hnf4-dbd, however , the e153d substitution mediates the shortening of the side chain of this acid residue, which in turn facilitates water molecules insertion that can be accommodated between it and dna, enabling water mediated hydrogen bonds with the fourth anti-sense base . this directs the interactions between the d <dig> residue and dna also in a downstream sense . still, an interesting issue is that the less discussed q188r substitution at this receptor makes possible that the side chain of this residue can extend itself over the minor groove, in the same downstream direction that the other two substitutions at the recognition helix. beyond it, the longer, positive charged and bidentate chain of the arg residue promotes stronger interactions to the backbone phosphates, apparently compensating the relatively labile interactions of the d <dig> residue with the dna .

although the influence of substitutions at the hnf <dig> r <dig> or gr p <dig>  or still any other dbd  <dig> position over the hre specificity has still not been systematically checked, such structural analysis, taken all together, corroborates that residue substitutions at the set  <dig> of the correlation network could act in a concerted way to adapt the dbd positioning to aberrant dna contexts.

an alternative residue subset including a divergent p-box for caenorhabditis elegans, and insights about the role of the t147f substitution
what is particularly striking is the appearance of residue set  <dig>  in the analysis. the resulting p-box motif  appears exclusively on c. elegans and c. briggsae, even though the final alignment is populated by other sequences from class chromadorea . a search using all available sequences shows that this is true both for cracaa and the physical-chemical similar motif ckacaa, with  <dig> and  <dig> available sequences, all of them from the caenorhabditis genus. these results show that even though the explosive expansion of the nuclear receptor family in nematodes was accompanied by enough diversification in order to keep a statistically significant sequence number after the cutoffs described in materials and methods , it is still noticeable that many of them kept conserved a specific p-box motif that is only found in this clade - which suggests that, analogous to what happens at the 3-ketosteroid receptors subclass, this group of nematode nuclear receptor may have evolved a different binding mode for dna response elements.

the aberrant e153r substitution at set 1: implications for divergences on the first basis step and half site topology
the more intriguing substitution at the first set of the correlation network however is, without a doubt, the e153r one. such substitution changes, simultaneous and drastically, the nature of the charge , the pattern of interaction at hydrogen bonds  and the extension of the side chain ; beyond to promote an enlargement of the terminal bidentate group . in face of such accentuated physical-chemical and stereochemical changes, it is equally expected drastic changes at the topology and physical-chemical ambient of the complementary dna sequence, implying on additional modifications on half site specificity. the co-substitution of the gly residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> by ala is concurrent with the necessity of global topological changes on the major groove  for accommodation of the substitutions at set  <dig>  in particular, r <dig> presents both a correlation with an ala at position  <dig> as well as an anti-correlation with a gly at the same position . due the localization of the  <dig> residue near the center of the recognition helix  , it is expected that the side chain at this position presents more profound correlations with the global dna topology . as already discussed, the e153r substitution is anti-correlated with the presence of the k <dig> residue , which is justified by the physical proximity of the two residues, establishing an important saline bond when a glu and a lys are present at the respective positions . so the presence of the positively charged and long chain r <dig> on set  <dig> is accompanied by a k156a substitution that removes the positive charge and shortens the side chain at the site  <dig>  a second inference that can be taken about such co-substitution is that the r153:dna contacts should compensate the loss of the k156:dna ones, i.e. r <dig> must interact with the first basis step of the half site . the g154a bulky substitution at the opposite side of the half-site could, in turn, contribute to "push" the dbd mass center in the upstream direction  in order to facilitate the interaction of the r <dig> with these upstream basis, and even the packing of the r <dig>  on the other h-a extremity, against the f <dig> residue , in an analogous way that the g154s substitution on 3-keto-steroid receptors seems to facilitate the positioning of the substituted g157v over the kink region on figure 2-d. it is also interesting to note that the set of alanine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the phenylalanine at position  <dig> form a hydrophobic "belt" between the recognition helix and the backbone wall, which could be helpful to adjust the h-a at the surface of the half site, while the three "deeper" arginine residues at the helix extremities  mediate the specific protein-basis contacts in a symmetric way .

hence, the half site specific adaptations inferred for the e153r substitutions  are, in principle, permissive for the adaptation individually inferred due the simultaneous t147f and k160r substitutions . although the sequence based prediction of protein:dna specificity is still a hard, and in a certain way risky, task , a goal for future studies would be to test the affinity of representative c. elegans dbds for the  <dig> possibilities of the 5'-nnttca-3' half site and for more canonical ones , as well as the search for such sequences on c. elegans promoters .

an apparent role for the  <dig> and  <dig> residues  in counter-balanced interactions related to the dna-axis along the evolution
finally, the statistics of residue prevalence at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  in the dbds whose sequences fall at this same set, reveals interesting aspects of an apparent co-evolution of these two positions and from them and the rest of the correlation network. the great majority of the pfam sequences used in our correlation analysis present the residues corresponding to sets  <dig> and  <dig>  hence, with a glutamine at position  <dig> and an aspartate at position  <dig>  as previously discussed and considering just dbds that do not share the divergent set  <dig>  the position  <dig> present some less frequent modifications, or as part of an alternative group  or as an individual discrepancy . surprisingly, d <dig>  which does not interact with dna and that is repulsive for the backbone phosphates, is significantly more conserved between the dbds that do not share the set  <dig>  for the c. elegans dbds presenting the set  <dig> however, while the position  <dig> present almost exclusively basic residues , the position  <dig> has an accentuate variance, allowing almost all of the  <dig> aminoacids except prolines and tryptophans. the more prevalent residues at this position on c. elegans are glutamine , serine  and glutamate , ranging, so, significantly, in chain size, charge and hydrogen bonding pattern even between the three more representative residues.

figures 8-a and b depict, respectively, model-structures of complexes with major groove's half sites  for a typical dbd with sets  <dig> and  <dig> and for a c. elegans dbd with the set  <dig>  the positions of residues  <dig> and  <dig> are highlighted in both structures. it can be noted that these two residues present themselves in opposite sides considering both the dna principal axis, as an imaginary line passing by the d-box mass center and the nearest phosphate at the dna's backbone wall . for typical dbds, while the interaction at the site  <dig> is attractive, the one at the site  <dig> is moderately repulsive . in fact, the d <dig> residue is surrounded by basic residues that interpose between it and the dna backbone, hence masking its repulsive contribution. in this way, the set of interactions perpendicular to the dna and the dbd principal axis are more favorable at the q <dig> side. for the divergent dbds from c. elegans, however, the ranging on the size and the coordination number of the basic residue at the  <dig> site  plus the high variance on the physical-chemistry at the  <dig> site promotes a significant variation on the way in which the interactions at each side of the axes are counterbalanced for different dbds. it is expected that such pattern allows small variations on the angle in which the recognition helix fits the major groove for different dbds , which in turn can be used at the adaptation for different dimerization partners and/or different half-sites .

another indication that the counter-balancing of interactions along the dna and the dbd principal axis seems to be a driving force along the evolution is the pattern at which the residues from set  <dig> and  <dig> distribute themselves along the major groove interaction . both sets of residues are located at different diagonals crossing the dna principal axis ; in order to stay, mostly, at different sides considering also an axis perpendicular to the first and passing through the h-a center . in this sense, each set controls interaction networks that, in principle, modulate the positioning of the dbd at each one of these respective diagonals  and that, taken all together, can regulate small translation and rotation movements for the dbd around the entire major groove's inclined plane.

taken all together, the correlation analysis for the dbds indicates that evolutionary correlations for this domain are implicated on global fitting at the dna topology, superposing such long range effects over the local interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
the correlation analysis of nuclear receptors presented here made possible the discussion of many residue-specific features in this protein family that could not be easily achieved from methods using just positional conservation. while lbds were previously analyzed by such methods, the residue-specific approach revealed a much detailed picture for the relations between the different functional surfaces and class-specific residues. for dbds, there is a strong clade-specific element in the correlation analysis, which, when analyzed in the light of the many structures of dna bound dbds, opens interesting possibilities for the understanding of hormone response elements specificity. we expect that such effort will be helpful in understanding the functional evolution of nrs, as well as to broaden the knowledge on the mechanisms of specific protein:dna co-adaptation, an also on the molecular evolution of nuclear receptors.
