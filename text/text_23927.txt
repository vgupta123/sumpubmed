BACKGROUND
the advanced snakes  consist of a monophyletic group of four families: atractaspididae, "colubridae", elapidae and viperidae  <cit> . these snakes have evolved biochemical weapon , rather than mechanical means of handling prey. phylogenetic studies show that the venom gland  evolved once at the base of the colubroidea about 60â€“ <dig> million years ago and has undergone extensive "evolutionary tinkering" of delivery systems and compositions of venom  <cit> . phylogenetic reconstruction between toxin genes and snake families showed that the recruitment of toxin families into the venom gland has occurred multiple times by both basal  and independent  recruitment events  <cit> . approximately  <dig> families of toxins have been catalogued in snake venom proteomes, and several families appear to be specific to a particular family of venomous snakes . sarafotoxins are found only in venoms of atractaspididae; serine proteinases related to blood coagulation factors xa, cobra venom factor, waprins and avit  family peptides appear to be limited to the elapidae; and vascular endothelial growth factor , disintegrins, waglerins, dipeptidyl peptidase iv and crotamine occur primarily in venoms of the viperidae . the occurrence, relative abundance and pharmacological potency of various members of these toxin families in venom make envenomation remarkably complex. envenomation by elapid snakes is usually characterized by rapid neurotoxic complications due to presence of large amounts of postsynaptic neurotoxins  <cit> , while envenomation by viperid snakes evokes complex hemorrhagic, hypotensive and inflammatory effects caused by the actions of numerous serine proteinases, metalloproteinases and c-type lectins   <cit> . effects of envenomation by snakes in the genus atractaspis can include vasoconstriction, resulting in cardiac arrest  <cit> . despite overall similarity in clinical symptoms exhibited after envenomation by members of a particular family of snakes, there exists considerable species-specific variation in absolute effects within each group, contributing to the difficulty in assessing and treating envenomated victims.

previously, identification and characterization of venom components relied primarily on various methods in protein chemistry or on cloning of individual genes. however, neither approach is well-suited to detect toxins that are found in low abundance. therefore, the apparent absence of a particular family of toxins from venom could be due either to their very low abundance or to the lack of expression in the venom gland. the genes of low abundance toxins are best discovered by the construction of a cdna library and sequencing of a sizeable number of ests. using this approach, new toxin genes in known families as well as several completely new families of toxins have been discovered, and the spectrum of snake toxin proteome is gradually expanding  <cit> . to search for novel and low abundance toxin genes or new families of toxins, we constructed a cdna library and sequenced ests from the venom gland of sistrurus catenatus edwardsii .

sistrurus catenatus  is a small pitviper broadly distributed across the north american prairies from ontario, canada and new york to extreme southeastern arizona, with an apparently disjunct population in northern chihuahua, mexico  <cit> . one subspecies, s. c. edwardsii , occurs primarily in arid and desert grasslands, occasionally occurring in dune formations and desert scrub  <cit> . populations of s. catenatus generally are threatened or declining rangewide, primarily as a result of habitat loss and human encroachment, and therefore endangered species status has been recommended  <cit> . in a systematic study, holycross and mackessy  <cit>  showed that among colorado, arizona and new mexico populations of s. c. edwardsii, lizards are the major prey, followed by small mammals and centipedes. in the present work, the venom gland has been collected from snakes originating from the colorado population.

general symptoms of envenomation resulting from many north american pitvipers bite are pain, local tissue effects  with coagulopathy  and thrombocytopenia as systemic effects. however, there is no specific report to date in the literature concerning envenomation by s. c. edwardsii. profiling of toxin expression of this threatened snake species will give a global view for the expression of all genres of toxins, including variation in coding/noncoding sequences and their evolutionary trends. the results of this study will also help in the understanding of envenomation processes of rattlesnake bites, which in turn will be important for more effective clinical treatment and antivenom management in cases of snakebite.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> ests produced readable sequences. the sizes of sequences showed a distribution between  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, with an average of  <dig> base pairs . a total of  <dig> clusters were obtained and subsequently all clusters checked manually .

the variations observed among toxin isoforms in this library are not due to population level diversity as they are derived from the venom gland of a single snake

a large number of ests matched with snake toxins . others code for cellular  proteins , and  <dig> hypothetical ests . nine ests  matched with mitochondrial genes. fifteen ests did not significantly match with any sequence available in non-redundant databases. further, they do not have any orfs and may represent either long utrs  or regulatory rnas and may have important functions in the rapidly expressing gland tissues. the library contains a large portion of putative toxin genes  compared to the cellular est population . we determined the complete sequence of the longest est of each cluster and sequences were confirmed by repeated sequencing. we completed the sequencing for all major toxins and two low abundant toxin-like transcripts . the existence of genes of particular interest, especially singletons, was confirmed by rt-pcr, using a separate pool of rna that was used to make cdna library as template, followed by sequencing.

confirmation of species
taxonomic identification at the molecular level is essential to ensure species identity  <cit> , and 12s and 16s mitochondrial ribosomal rnas are commonly used in the classification of snakes  <cit> . three ests for the 12s rna gene  in our library show 100% identity to the reported s. c. edwardsii ribosomal sequence   <cit> , confirming the venom gland used to make the library is of s. c. edwardsii origin. interestingly, we observed that the ribosomal rna sequence has poly tail and therefore they appeared in the cdna library. polyadenylation of ribosomal rna has been observed in yeast , fungus , protistan parasites  and human  cells, and it is proposed to have a quality control role in rrna degradation  <cit> . this is a preliminary report showing the possibility of polyadenylation of ribosomal rna in a reptilian system. on closer examination, we found a putative polyadenylation signal   <cit>  sequence six bases upstream of the poly tail.

identification of toxin families
serine proteinase
the serine proteinases in the venom gland library of s. c. edwardsii are expressed with the highest transcript abundance   and belong to  <dig> clusters. multiple clones appeared in  <dig> clusters, while  <dig> were singletons . one representative est from each cluster was completely sequenced . one of the clusters  contains only 3'utr . this cluster shows 90% similarity with the 3'utr of a serine proteinase from bothrops jararaca venom gland  <cit> .

most snake venom serine proteinases  to date are single polypeptide chains, except for two fibrinolytic enzymes from the venom of a korean viper, agkistrodon blomhoffi brevicaudus . in both cases, a single chain precursor is most likely cleaved by proteolysis  <cit> . in our library, one cluster  shows 90% and 83% sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively to salmonase. it is not clear whether or not it is also processed to form a heterodimeric serine proteinase in s. c. edwardsii venom.

the svsps are found in all families of snakes and in general, they perturb the hemostatic mechanisms of prey. they act on diverse protein substrates such as fibrinogen, kininogen and platelet receptors  <cit> . some svsps exhibit more than one activity. for example, in addition to their thrombin-like activity, bothrombin, crotalase and lm-tl induce platelet aggregation, kinin release and gyratory activities, respectively  <cit> . we constructed a neighbor-joining  phylogenetic tree with  <dig> newly identified svsp isoforms from s. c. edwardsii, to assign putative functions and to examine trends in the evolution of new isoforms  <cit>  . the phylogenetic tree showed a scattered distribution of various isoforms with different pharmacological activities from several species of pitvipers. this pattern indicates that svsps diverged after snake lineages speciated. many svsps are commonly considered as thrombin-like enzymes  because they mimic the fibrinogenolytic function of thrombin, promoting blood coagulation. therefore, in most cases only fibrinogenolytic function of svsps is tested and the svsp is categorized as a tle. however, some thrombin-like enzymes, in addition to releasing fibrinopeptide a and/or b from fibrinogen, also activate protein c  <cit> , complement c <dig>  <cit>  and platelets  <cit> . therefore, it would be interesting to determine the specific pharmacological properties of various svsp isoforms within each group and map these on their evolutionary relationships.

svsp genes belong to a multigene family, and the protein-coding regions have been shown to be experiencing accelerated evolution within the venom glands of pitvipers  <cit> . such accelerated evolution could lead to the changes in surface loops surrounding the substrate binding site, resulting in the variation of substrate recognition and hence, the function of the protein. the ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution  of the protein coding sequences of serine proteinase isoforms of this species was found to be  <dig> , indicating a trend toward accelerated evolution and therefore divergence in pharmacological function during envenomation.

metalloproteinase and disintegrin
a total of  <dig> ests fall into  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singletons for this family of proteins  . one representative est from each cluster was sequenced . snake venom metalloproteinase  precursors are classified into four groups according to size and domain composition: pi ; pii ; piii ; and piv   <cit> . none of the clusters encode pi type svmps.

the pii isoform from s. c. edwardsii  matches  with the precursors of contortrostatin  and acostatin Î² chain  from a. contortrix contortrix venom. contortrostatin and acostatin are homodimeric and heterodimeric disintegrins, respectively  <cit> . the Î± chain of acostatin is independently encoded and unlike other disintegrins, it is not derived by proteolytic processing  <cit> . however, we did not identify any ests matching the Î± chain of acostatin. phylogenetic analysis shows that dq <dig> is closer to dimeric than monomeric disintegrins . in the dimeric disintegrins, c <dig> and c <dig> form disulfide bridges with the other subunit  <cit> . however, in the monomeric disintegrins, c <dig> and c <dig> form disulfide bridges with c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, making them unavailable for dimerization . thus, characteristic cys residues  are present in all monomeric disintegrins but are absent from dimeric disintegrins  <cit> . the pii svmp of s. c. edwardsii  contains c <dig> and c <dig> in the disintegrin domain and is likely the precursor of a monomeric disintegrin. other monomeric disintegrins, barbourin and tergeminin, were characterized previously from the venom of s. miliarius barbouri and s. c. tergeminus, respectively  <cit> .

the main integrin receptor binding motif of disintegrins, rgd, is found to be at the tip of a flexible hairpin loop. variation of amino acid residues in this motif  on the flexible loop confers specificity towards specific receptors, e.g., replacement of r with a k in rgd motif of barbourin and ussuristatin  <dig> significantly increases the selectivity for Î±iibÎ² <dig>  without affecting its binding to Î±5Î² <dig>  or Î±vÎ² <dig>   <cit> . additionally, the residues immediately adjacent to the rgd loop also influence both selectivity and affinity for integrin receptors  <cit> . for example, disintegrins with rgdw and rgdnp have selectively higher affinity for Î±iibÎ² <dig> and Î±vÎ² <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the rgdnp-containing disintegrins are 10-fold more potent than rgdw-containing disintegrins in blocking the adhesion of cells mediated by Î±5Î² <dig>  the putative disintegrin from s. c. edwardsii has rgdnp, compared to rgdw and kgdw in tergeminin and barbourin, respectively. therefore, further studies of the physiological relevance of variation in receptor selectivity among disintegrins from the same genus will be very informative.

the piii class of svmps are functionally more diverse: they exhibit hemorrhagic activity, inflammatory effects, inhibition of platelet aggregation, apoptosis and prothrombin activation  <cit> . all members of the piii class of svmps have six conserved cys residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in their metalloproteinase domain, and some isoforms have a seventh cys residue at three variable positions   <cit> . the presence of the seventh cys residue at position  <dig>  results in proteolysis/autolysis, producing a product comprised of the disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains , whereas when it is present at position  <dig> , the formation of a homodimeric structure results  <cit> ). we have not found any isoform having a cys residue at position  <dig>  in our library. two isoforms  from s. c. edwardsii venom possess a seventh cys residue in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and they can be grouped as piiia and piiib svmps, respectively . two other isoforms  do not possess a seventh cys residue and hence cannot be grouped with any subgroups. some other isoforms, such as hr1a  <cit>  and hf <dig>  <cit> , also do not have the seventh cys residue in the metalloproteinase domain. we propose that these metalloproteinases be grouped under piii <dig>  . the isoform dq <dig> is a partial segment and it cannot be assigned to any subgroup. however, it shows identity with the a chain of a heterodimeric metalloproteinase identified in the venom of vipera lebetina which induces apoptosis in endothelial cell lines  <cit> . overall, the venom of s. c. edwardsii appears to have significant molecular variation among metalloproteinases and their derived components.

phospholipase a2
interestingly, in our cdna library only one cluster of pla <dig>  was found, despite having the second highest transcript abundance  . it matches with an acidic pla <dig> of s. c. tergeminus, with only one amino acid residue  difference at position  <dig>  p â†’ q, in the mature form. thus there is no diversity of pla <dig> in s. c. edwardsii venom, though snake venom pla <dig> is one of the most rapidly evolving enzyme families. in most species, several isoforms of pla <dig> are observed in cdna libraries and venoms  <cit> , and these have acquired diverse physiological functions  <cit> . this observation is also supported by proteomic analysis of s. c. edwardsii venom, while venoms from individuals of other species of sistrurus contain multiple pla <dig> isoforms  <cit> .

phosphodiesterase
sequence of a partial singleton est   shows 60% identity to the c-terminal region of the phosphodiesterase gene from chimpanzee . this is the first cdna sequence for a phosphodiesterase from snake venom. phosphodiesterase activity has been observed in venoms of elapidae, viperidae and colubridae snakes  <cit> ; however, the role of this enzyme in envenomation is not yet clear. venom phosphodiesterases hydrolyze 5'-phosphodiester and pyrophosphate bonds in nucleotides and nucleic acids and release 5'-diphosphates, 5'-monophosphates and purines  <cit> . free purines are also present in snake venoms, and they may contribute to envenomation sequelae  <cit> .

l-amino acid oxidase
we obtained one cluster having  <dig> ests  . the complete sequence  shows high sequence identity  with lao of crotalus adamanteus venom. laos are widely found in snake venoms and in addition to catalyzing the oxidative deamination of amino acids, they affect platelets, induce apoptosis and have hemorrhagic effects  <cit> .

c-type lectin
in our library, clp account for approximately  <dig> % abundance and have one cluster  and two singletons  . on blastp search, they match with the Î² subunit of mamushigin , chh-b , and the a chain of factor ix/factor x binding protein   respectively. mamushigin, chh-b and ix/x-bp are heterodimeric; however, in our library, we did not find any match to ests encoding the corresponding complementary subunits. therefore, it may be interesting to examine the clp-related proteins in this venom and determine their biological properties.

growth factors
we obtained one cluster  encoding vascular endothelial growth factor  . sequencing of  <dig> clones from this cluster showed there are two isoforms  with only two amino acid residue  differences at positions  <dig>  q â†’ e, and  <dig>  k â†’ e. we also sequenced a singleton  encoding nerve growth factor . another singleton  matched with the c-terminus of connective tissue growth factor-related protein . this is the first report of ctgf-related protein in a venom cdna library. its origin in the venom gland, instead of other surrounding tissues, needs to be verified.

cysteine-rich secretory protein
we obtained one cluster   for a crisp  which matches with catrin  from c. atrox venom. crisps are widely distributed in mammals, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, nematodes, cone snails and plants, and they exhibit diverse biological functions  <cit> . they are single chain , highly conserved proteins organized in three domains: a pr- <dig>  domain, a hinge domain and a cysteine-rich domain . they contain  <dig> cys residues forming eight conserved disulfide bonds. a few snake venom crisps have been shown to act upon various ion channels through the crd domain  <cit> . however, the function of the majority of crisps from snake venom is unknown  <cit> . therefore, it may be interesting to examine the biological properties of the crisp found in s. c. edwardsii venom.

bradykinin-potentiating peptide and c-type natriuretic peptide
we found a singleton  encoding a bpp-cnp  which showed 80% identity with a bpp-cnp precursor from lachesis muta  <cit> . the bpp-cnp family of proteins lowers the blood pressure of prey during envenomation. its low abundance in our library indicates that bpp-cnp may not have a significant role in envenomation by sistrurus, unlike bites by other pitvipers  in southern america  <cit> .

three-finger toxin like transcripts
we obtained three individual singletons  in the library  which belong to the 3ftx family of proteins. as 3ftxs are very uncommon in viperid venoms, using targeted approach we performed rt-pcr using a separate pool of rna as template and sequenced  <dig> clones. we found a total of five isoforms of 3ftx-like trancripts  . they have a signal peptide followed by a mature protein consisting of 64â€“ <dig> residues. they appear to belong to the non-conventional 3ftxs  <cit> , with five disulfide bridges, and the fifth disulfide bridge is in loop  <dig> . all isoforms have the potential n-glycosylation motif, n-x-t/s .

3ftxs were thought to be found only in elapid/hydrophiid venoms, though the origin of recruitment to the elapid/hydrophid venom proteome is not clear  <cit> . a polypeptide toxin  which crossreacts with Î±-bungarotoxin and binds with high affinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  was isolated from the venom of a. halys   <cit> . however, no sequence information of this protein is available. recently, three clones  were obtained from a cdna library of l. muta venom gland which potentially encode polypeptides similar to 3ftx fold proteins  <cit> . however, only one clone  has the start and stop codons ; the other two do not. these sequences do not have any homology, at either the nucleotide or protein levels, to those obtained from s. c. edwardsii .

phylogenetic analysis of 3ftxs from three families of snakes  was achieved using paup  <dig> b  <cit> . trees obtained using neighbor joining  or parsimony analysis  were somewhat different, but major topological features were retained . one transcript from s. c. edwardsii  does not cluster with the other four but falls within a separate clade containing naja and bungarus  3ftxs. four other transcripts of s. c. edwardsii form a monophyletic clade within an exclusively elapid clade. interestingly, both methods place l. muta  clones  and coelognathus radiatus  3ftx as basal to all other 3ftxs, suggesting a common origin followed by diversification of 3ftxs among all advanced snakes. very similar trees, with the same topology of family groups, were obtained using bayesian analyses and hence support the above conclusions .

this family of proteins was not observed in a detailed proteomic characterization of s. catenatus and s. miliarius barbouri venoms  <cit> . cdna libraries of other viper venom glands, including b. jararacussu, b. insularis, a. acutus and deinagkistrodon acutus, do not show their presence  <cit> . this could be due to either low abundance transcripts and proteins or non-uniform recruitment of 3ftx into the venom proteome within viperidae. in s. c. edwardsii, the low transcript abundance  suggests that 3ftx are minor components of the mature venom.

in snake venoms, 3ftxs exhibit diverse pharmacological effects due to their ability to target various receptors and ion channels  <cit> . it is important to note that the Î²-sheeted loops play crucial roles in binding to various targets, and these regions are the most variable among s. c. edwardsii 3ftxs. further, the dn/ds ratio of  <dig>   for their coding sequences indicates that a trend towards accelerated evolution is present, as with the serine proteinases. if the variations in the Î² sheet loop regions are the result of positive selection , they may exhibit distinct and novel biological activities.

novel toxin-like transcript
in our library, we obtained one singleton   with an orf encoding a signal peptide  and a mature protein . the putative mature protein is rich in cys residues, similar to many other snake venom toxins. its n-terminal domain matches with kunitz/bpti toxins  and the middle domain matches with waprins , and the novel transcript has an extended c-terminus . both kunitz/bpti  <cit>  and waprins  <cit>  are found separately as single domain proteins in snake venoms. two of the cys residues, which form one of the four disulfide bonds in waprins, are missing in the new transcript . rt-pcr using a fresh rna  as template and sequencing experiments show the presence of this fused transcript in the venom gland and hence it is not an artifact due to template switching by the reverse transcriptase used for making the cdna library  <cit> . although a number of cdna sequences of kunitz/bpti from snake venoms have been completed, none of them have the waprin domain and the c-terminal extension. currently, cdna sequences of waprins are not known. however, this is the first experimental evidence for the presence of a waprin domain  in viperid venom.

the longer orf having kunitz/bpti and waprin domains together could be due to the fusion of two individual genes encoding kunitz/bpti and waprin. gene fusion mediated by exon shuffling  has been established as an essential genetic mechanism for the origin of new genes in invertebrates, vertebrates and plants  <cit> . recently, a new genetic process, transcription-induced chimerism , in cases of tandemly located gene pairs has been shown to be responsible for gene fusion in the human genome, producing chimeric proteins  <cit> . it is not clear at this stage how this novel fused gene has originated in the snake venom gland. this fused transcript may code either for a precursor which is processed to form two individual classes of venom proteins  or a novel toxin with two distinct domains and having a new biological function. it has been observed that new genes often give rise to new biological functions driven by adaptive darwinian selection  <cit> . the mechanism of fusion of these apparently independent genes, the evolutionary trajectory of this fused gene and the potential new toxic function of the chimeric protein are all areas for future investigation.

iron-binding protein
four ests   showed homology with an iron-binding protein with a potential signal peptide. although most iron-binding proteins are generally categorized as storage protein, some of them, such as ovotransferrin and lactoferrin, have antimicrobial activities  <cit> . it is not clear whether or not this protein is found in the venom. however, omwaprin, a member of the waprin protein family, and the c-terminal region of a myotoxic pla <dig> were both shown to have antimicrobial activity  <cit> .

identification of cellular transcripts
we obtained  <dig> clusters  which are involved in various cellular functions, including transcription and translation, secretion, post-translational modification, general metabolism and other functions . similar house-keeping protein products have been observed in other snake venom glands  <cit> . one of the ests  matches  a calcium- and integrin-binding protein which assists platelet spreading  <cit> . although modulation of platelet and integrin functions is a key activity of several snake venom components, we do not believe that this protein is present in venom, as it lacks the signal peptide.

overall, results from our cdna library demonstrate extensive molecular diversity in the venom composition of s. c. edwardsii. serine proteinase and metalloproteinase isoforms are the most abundant components and in the venom, they exert diverse pharmacological activities, particularly disrupting hemostasis. the numerous minor components likely play an ancillary role in envenomation. these diverse toxin isoforms, together with minor components, may be characteristic of venoms from species utilizing different prey types, such as lizards  and birds and mammals   <cit> .

venom composition and genetics of their origin
snake venoms consist of a diverse range of pharmacologically active protein and peptide toxins which are primarily used in prey capture and secondarily as defense weapons. to date, the majority of the work on toxin identification and characterization has been concentrated on snakes of the families elapidae and viperidae because they are often abundant, produce high yields of venom and represent a significant risk to human health worldwide. recent studies of venom transcriptomes and proteomes indicate that our knowledge of venom composition is partly limited by experimental detectability. for example, 3ftxs, which were thought to be found exclusively in elapid venoms, were detected in viperid venom gland transcriptomes only recently . similarly, clp, thought to be limited to viperid venoms, have been detected recently in the venom gland of philodryas olfersii  and bungarus species   <cit> . further, a new family of low abundance toxin  was identified in both elapid and viperid venoms  <cit> , therefore, with the application of advanced techniques like est sequencing, "compositional specificities" between families of venomous snakes may become less distinct . multiple recruitment events may lead to an increase in the spectrum of known and unknown toxin families, decreasing the compositional specificities among venomous snakes. however, differential contribution of specific toxins to the overall expressed proteome of venomous snakes does lead to significant differences in venom composition between species.

a central theme in the evolution of venom systems is complete duplication of toxin genes, followed by accelerated evolution which favors nonsynonymous amino acid substitution towards neofunctionalization. modification of selected surface areas of toxins  <cit>  is responsible for producing the functional diversity in animal  toxin multigene families  <cit> . however, one important observation in the present report is the occurrence of a novel toxin-like transcript generated by fusion of two individual toxin genes, kunitz/bpti and waprin, in a snake venom gland. though the mechanism for creation of this fused gene needs to be studied further, it clearly indicates that other genetic processes  are also operating in the venom gland to create novel toxin genes. genes originating by other genetic processes such as exon shuffling are recent  <cit> , and therefore the addition of this fused toxin-like transcript to the venom proteome is perhaps new. at this stage, it is tempting to speculate that the origin of modular organization of different classes of svmps, which appears to be the result of gene fusion events, may be due to a genetic process other than gene duplication. svmps are very abundant toxins and carry out a principal role in envenomation by viperid snakes, and therefore studies of their genetic origin and organization will be of great interest. circumstantial evidence of trans-splicing for the generation of serine proteinase isoforms in the venom gland of v. lebetina has been presented  <cit> . kopelman et al. <cit>  have shown that alternative splicing and gene duplication are inversely correlated evolutionary mechanisms. according to parra et al.  <cit> , only 4â€“5% of the tandem gene pairs in the human genome can produce chimeric proteins. it is obvious that these alternative genetic processes responsible for expanding functional proteomes are uncommon among biological systems, and it is therefore not surprising in our case to have just a singleton of the fused transcript out of  <dig> ests . this also demonstrates that to detect rare genetic processes operating in the venom gland, the library generated must be of high quality and that subsequent analyses must be performed very carefully. in turn, these analyses help elucidate in detail the principles of evolution of snake venom transcriptome which have led to the evolutionary success of the advanced snakes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the composition of snake venoms has been shown to be dependent on numerous factors, including phylogeny, diet, age, geography and even sex  <cit> . in general, greater similarity of venoms will be observed along broad phylogenetic lines . however, as this study has demonstrated, some toxins classically considered to occur in only one family, such as the 3ftxs, are actually broadly distributed among the advanced snakes . the present capacity to detect low abundance toxins indicates a greater compositional similarity of venoms among advanced snakes than has been previously recognized. further, we have demonstrated that in addition to gene duplication, exon shuffling or transcriptional splicing may also contribute to generating the diversity of toxins and toxin isoforms observed among snake venoms. overall, the elucidation of the venom gland transcriptome of s. c. edwardsii contributes to a broader picture of toxin expression which complements and extends proteomic analysis of this venom  <cit> . these approaches can lead to the identification of new toxins and provides mechanistic explanations for their evolution and diversification. an unresolved question involves the relationship between the venom gland transcriptome and how this is ultimately translated to the final proteome. this variable proteomic composition in turn determines the complex and often difficult to resolve sequelae which frequently develop following envenomation by the different species of venomous snakes.
