BACKGROUND
almost all metazoan eggs are surrounded by a proteinaceous matrix that is referred to as the zona pellucida  in mammals and the vitelline coat  in non-mammals. zp/vc proteins play important roles in fertilization and provide a protective barrier for oviparous animals, such as the amphioxus, fishes and amphibians. the family of zp proteins is characterized by a conserved protein-protein interaction module, the zp module
 <cit> . the zp module can be divided into two related domains, zp-n and zp-c, and the latter domain associates with the external hydrophobic patch 
 <cit> . the three-dimensional structure of the mammalian zp <dig> shows that the ehp lies at the interface between the zp-n and zp-c domains, which are connected by a long loop that carries a conserved o-glycan important for sperm binding
 <cit> . the dissociation of ehp from the zp-c domain allows the zp proteins to polymerize on the surface of oocytes, thus forming the extracellular coat
 <cit> .

zp proteins have been characterized from diverse metazoan taxa, including many major groups of jawed vertebrates, urochordates and molluscs. in mammals, the zp proteins are a family of 3– <dig> genes divided into  <dig> subtypes
 <cit> . however, the lower vertebrates, including fish
 <cit> , birds
 <cit>  and amphibians
 <cit> , typically contain a greater number of zp genes and subtypes
 <cit> .

the observation that zp proteins are the major constituents of the vitelline coats of the abalones, an invertebrate group belonging to the protostome phylum mollusc, which is evolutionarily distant from vertebrates , raised the possibility that the co-option of zp proteins to form the structural basis of gamete recognition could be a wide-spread phenomenon in metazoan evolution
 <cit> . on the one hand, both vertebrate and abalone zp proteins form monophyletic clades that are distinct from one another, which might suggest independent recruitment of zp domain-containing proteins rather than a common origin
 <cit> . on the other hand, egg coat zp proteins rapidly evolve because of positive selection
 <cit> ; therefore, it is difficult to infer correct phylogenetic relationships of the invertebrate and vertebrate egg coat zps even they had possessed a common ancestor. the recent identification of zp proteins acting as sperm recognition molecules on the vitelline coats of urochordates , the closest relatives to vertebrates, slightly bridged the gap in the evolutionary landscape of egg coat zp proteins between the low invertebrates and vertebrates
 <cit> . however, it remains unclear whether zp proteins are also egg coat constituents in the chordate subphylum, cephalochordata . recent genome-wide gene comparisons established that cephalochordata is at the base of chordate phylogeny as the sister group of both urochordates and vertebrates
 <cit> . this unique phylogenetic position renders the cephalochordates as an important group in tracing the evolutionary process of the egg coat zp proteins.
 <cit> .

in this study, we characterized the protein composition from the egg coat of a cephalochordate species, b. belcheri, by mass spectrometry, from which we identified multiple zp proteins. we further examined the tissue distribution of the transcripts and mature proteins and observed that they are predominantly expressed in the developing eggs and localized in the cortical granules and extracellular spaces surrounding the eggs. we further identified homologous zp protein genes from a cyclostome, petromyzon marinus, to trace the evolutionary relationship of the amphioxus zp proteins with those of vertebrates. a sequence comparison of the zp domains among the zp proteins of gnathostome and cyclostome vertebrates, urochordates and cephalochordates showed that cephalochordate egg coat zp proteins shared higher sequence similarities with vertebrates than urochordates and reliably suggested a distant homology between the cephalochordate and vertebrate zps. therefore, the chordate egg coat zp proteins might have a common origin deeply rooted in the lower invertebrates.

RESULTS
sds-page analyses of proteins from unfertilized and fertilized b. belcheri egg coats
a mature and unfertilized b. belcheri egg has a diameter of approximately  <dig> μm and is surrounded by a smooth and round egg coat  layer that is ~ <dig> μm thick . after fertilization, the ec quickly elevates, which expands the size of the fertilized egg to approximately  <dig> μm in diameter while leaves the cytoplasmic area unchanged . however, the thickness of the fertilized egg ec is not significantly reduced during the expansion , partially because of the discharge of stored ec proteins from the cortical granules and their incorporation into the expanding egg coat. the proteins from the unfertilized and fertilized egg ecs were subjected to sds-page analysis. figure 
2c shows that proteins in the unfertilized egg extracts could be separated into multiple bands with the major bands estimated to range from ~ <dig> kda to above  <dig> kda. by contrast, protein extracts from fertilized ecs showed fewer and more obviously separated bands with the major band clustered at  <dig> kda and some minor ones at  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda .

lc-ms/ms identification of zona pellucida domain-containing proteins from the egg coats
to identify the proteins present in the unfertilized egg ecs, the gel containing the electrophoretically separated ec proteins was sliced into  <dig> pieces  and subjected to lc-ms/ms analysis. through a search of the newly derived proteome from the b. belcheri entire genome sequencing project , we identified a total of  <dig> unique hits out of the  <dig> sets of mass spectrometry measurements that met the criteria set in the sequest software. these proteins were searched against the pfam  <dig>  database, from which we identified five proteins containing the zona pellucida domain . these zp proteins were named bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> based on the sequential order that they first appeared in the gel slices in the mass spectrometry analyses. among these proteins, bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> appeared in  <dig> and  <dig> gel slices, respectively , which suggests that the  <dig> proteins may be in multiple forms with different molecular weights in the unfertilized egg ecs.

to reduce the contamination from the cytoplasmic proteins and to enrich the egg coat protein components for the mass spectrometry analysis, we purified the ecs from the fertilized eggs, which are well separated from the cytoplasmic mass after egg coat expansion. these ec extracts were separated by page and sliced into  <dig> pieces for lc-ms/ms analysis . consistent with what was observed from the unfertilized egg ecs, we identified only the same  <dig> zp domain containing proteins from the fertilized egg ecs , which suggests that the  <dig> bbzps compose the complete set of zp components present in b. belcheri ecs. in addition, similar to situations observed in the unfertilized egg samples in which variants of bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> appeared in multiple gel slices, three bbzps  were detected in all  <dig> gel slices subjected to mass spectrometry in the fertilized egg samples , which suggests the presence of molecular variants with different molecular weights from these gene products.

the spectral counts observed in the mass spectrometry analysis have been suggested to approximately quantify the abundance of each protein in a sample
 <cit> . among the five identified zp proteins, bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> showed much higher spectral counts than bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig>  which suggests that these three proteins are the major zp protein types constituting the fertilized egg coat and unfertilized eggs . in addition to the zona pellucida domain-containing proteins, a number of proteins were detected in the fertilized egg ecs with spectral counts greater than  <dig> but fewer than those of bbzps . these proteins include a multiple egf-like domain protein, three vitellogenins, one zonadhesin-like protein, one melanotransferrin-like protein, a matrilin and an apolipoprotein b-like protein. a recent study showed that in the ascidian halocynthia roretzi, vitellogenin is a component of the vitelline coat and participates in fertilization as the egg-coat binding partner of sperm proteases
 <cit> . in addition, an apolipoprotein b-like protein has been demonstrated to reside both on the vc and in the egg cytoplasm of the ascidian c. intestinalis <cit> . therefore, a few other proteins are commonly present in the ecs of cephalochordates and urochordates in addition to multiple zp proteins.

characterization of the b. belcheri zp genes
we performed rt-pcr and 5’ and 3’ race using various primer sets and then sequenced the rt-pcr products to obtain the full-length coding sequences of the five zp domain-containing proteins. the full-length cdna of each zp gene was obtained by piecing together the overlapping fragments. the translated proteins from the full-length bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> transcripts are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. the sequence alignment of the  <dig> zp proteins is shown in additional file
2: figure s <dig> 

we searched for structural domains within the five zp proteins in the smart website , and the results are shown in figure 
 <dig>  in addition to the zp module observed in each protein, all bbzps contain a signal peptide for extracellular secretion. we also identified a low density lipoprotein receptor a  domain and a von willebrand factor type a  domain in bbzp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but none in bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> contains a transmembrane domain near its c-terminal that is not detected in other bbzps. bbzp <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have a consensus furin cleavage site  with four consecutive, positively charged amino acid residues . in rare cases, the vwfa domain is also observed to be present in vc proteins of the urochordate ciona intestinalis <cit> . sequence alignments of vwfa domains between bbzps and those of c. intestinalis showed little sequence similarity except at the positions where the vwfa-characteristic amino acids reside . notably, the egf-like domain, which is abundantly present in members of the zp protein family in urochordates
 <cit> , is absent in the bbzp proteins.

the above data revealed significant discrepancies between the calculated molecular weights of the predicted full-length bbzps and the positions each protein migrates on the polyacrilamide gel . among the  <dig> bbzps, the calculated mws range between ~ <dig> kda  and ~ <dig> kda . however, for the unfertilized egg ec sample, protein segments of bbzp <dig> are abundantly detected in the gel slices that supposedly contained proteins larger than  <dig> kda , whereas peptides of bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> were detected in the gel slices  supposedly containing only proteins with mws smaller than  <dig> kda . the discrepancy is more pronounced in the fertilized ec sample, in which protein fragments of three bbzps, bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig>  are observed in the gel positions  for proteins with mws greater than  <dig> kda, whereas the peptides from all  <dig> bbzps were detected in gel slices that should have contained proteins with mws less than  <dig> kda . a western blot analysis of the fertilized egg ec extracts, using specific antibodies against the  <dig> bbzps, further verified the high polymorphic nature of bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> .

egg coat zp proteins are well known to be highly glycosylated
 <cit> , which may contribute to the higher than expected mws in the sds-page analysis. to determine how potential glycosylation might have affected the bbzps, we treated the fertilized egg ec extracts with the enzyme pngase f, which was specific to cleave the n-linked glycosylation moieties off of the proteins. the overall gel migration pattern of the treated sample remained the same, except that the  <dig> kda band in the untreated sample narrowly separated into two  <dig> kda bands, the faint  <dig> kda band in the untreated sample disappeared, and a smaller  band appeared . these results indicate that glycosylation, at least n-glycosylation, is not the major factor in the observed aberrant migration patterns of the bbzps. it is possible that the incomplete disassociation of the bbzp polymers may have resulted in the higher than calculated mws observed in the polyacrylamide gels.

we checked whether alternative splicing of the bbzp transcripts could occur to understand why some bbzps appeared in the gels with smaller than calculated mws. within sets of specific primers of bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig>  we identified cdna variants that were shorter than expected from the full-length cdnas , indicating the presence of alternative splicing. the current survey of the bbzp transcripts is not exhaustive, and more alternatively spliced forms of bbzps will likely be identified if more complete rt-pcr experiments are performed. however, the smaller sized bbzp variants could be a result of proteolysis of the full-length bbzp precursors. for example, the vitelline coat zp protein, hrvc <dig>  is derived from hrvc <dig>  which is a larger vc zp protein in the urochordate h. roretzi <cit> .

tissue specific expression and cellular localization of the bbzps
we performed qrt-pcr analyses of total rnas from the gills, skin, liver, notochord, intestines, testes and ovaries to determine which tissues of b. belcheri express the bbzp genes. the results showed that for each gene, ovary tissue showed the most abundant expression . coinciding with the much higher spectral counts observed in the ms analysis , bbzp <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> expressed at levels approximately one-hundred times higher than bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> in the qrt-pcr measurements, which suggests that bbzp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are the major zp proteins to constitute the egg coat in b. belcheri. in addition to the ovary, other tissues, such as the skin and notochord, have low levels  of the zp genes expressed.

we performed in situ hybridization  using the antisense crna probes derived from the three major bbzp genes to determine the ovary cells that bbzp genes are expressed. strong hybridization signals are detected in small  oocytes, whereas they are absent in large-sized, more mature oocytes ; these findings indicate that the major bbzps are predominantly expressed in developing oocytes. by contrast, immunohistochemical  analyses using the specific antibodies against the identical three bbzps showed more even distributions among the variously sized oocytes across the landscape of the ovarian section. furthermore, strong ihc signals were observed on the surface of the oocytes and at the areas underneath where the granules localize . weak ish signals of the two minor bbzp types, bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig>  were also observed in the developing oocytes ; however, the detection of ihc signals using the in-house raised antibodies for these two proteins was ambiguous, possibly because of the low amounts of the two zp types in the egg coats.

b. belcheri zp proteins showed sequence homology with the non-jawed vertebrate, petromyzon marinus
we initially searched the genome of the non-jawed vertebrate p. marinus and the predicted proteome databases for bbzp protein homologues to elucidate how the zp proteins of the basal chordates are evolutionarily related to those of vertebrates. we identified  <dig> predicted proteins containing the zp domain . these proteins are not full-length because of the sequence gaps in the current public version of the p. marinus genome. however, when the zp domains from bbzp <dig>  pmzp <dig> and olzpa  are aligned, small regions of sequence homology occurs among the three zp proteins . considering that cysteine residues are important for the formation of correct zp domain structures
 <cit>  and that the number and location of the cysteine residues define zp protein subtypes, we examined the distribution of cysteine residues in the three groups of zp proteins. we observed that cysteines of bbzp proteins are either in the identical positions as or in close proximities of those of vertebrate zp proteins. in addition, four of the five bbzp proteins  and all of the vertebrate zp proteins identified in this study contain  <dig> cysteines in the zp domain region with the first  <dig> cysteines in the zp-n moiety and  <dig> in the zp-c moiety
 <cit> , which is a feature of the type ii zp domain according to the mammalian zp nomenclature
 <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses showed that zp genes of the basal chordate form a distinct evolutionary clade and most likely share a recent common ancestor with the lamprey zp proteins and zp1/ <dig> subtypes of the high vertebrates
we gathered entire sets of zp proteins from species of jawed vertebrates , a non-jawed vertebrate , cephalochordates , and a urochordate  to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between zp proteins from the major metazoan lineages. the zp domain regions of these proteins were identified and aligned. we constructed phylogenetic trees of the zp domains using bayes-based and neighbor-joining  approaches. the bayes-based approach yielded trees with higher confidence values for each node than the nj approach; thus, an unrooted bayes tree is shown in figure 
 <dig> to demonstrate the evolutionary relationship of the zps from the chordates. the zp proteins from the cephalochordates formed a distinct clade . clade b and clade a, which is composed of the zp <dig>  zp <dig>  and zpax of the jawed vertebrates and all of the lamprey zp proteins, appear to share a recent common ancestor. however, the urochordate zp proteins  and zp3/zpc of the jawed vertebrates  are evolutionarily more distant from the cephalochordate zp proteins, as judged from the branching lengths . notably, the lamprey zp proteins appeared to intercalate with the zp <dig>  zp <dig>  and zpax subtypes of the jawed vertebrates  in the phylogenetic tree , which indicates that the egg coat zp proteins had diversified into distinct subtypes defined in vertebrate zp nomenclature
 <cit>  in early vertebrate evolution. the sequence homology  and phylogenetic relationships deduced from this study  suggest that vertebrate zp proteins have an invertebrate origin.

discussion
using comprehensive proteomic approaches, we identified  <dig> proteins containing a zona pellucida domain from b. belcheri egg coat extracts . we further verified the physical location of these proteins on the egg coat by immunohistochemistry using antibodies raised to specifically target these zp proteins . a search for homologous genes in the published b. floridae genome revealed that all  <dig> of the b. belcheri genes have b. floridae orthologs and that each pair shared more than 80% protein sequence similarity. in addition, the genomic locations and relative orientations of the zp orthologs from the two species are highly conserved . in b. belcheri, a search of the newly sequenced genome showed that bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> form a synteny in scaffold  <dig>  bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig> co-localize in scaffold  <dig>  and bbzp <dig> localizes in a separate scaffold . notably, the genes in scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> were highly expressed, whereas the ones in scaffold  <dig> were not. similarly, in the b. floridae genome, the orthologs of bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig>  are observed in scaffold bf_v2_ <dig>  ~ <dig> kb apart from one another; the orthologs of bbzp <dig> and bbzp <dig>  are linked in tandem in scaffold bf_v2_ <dig> with ~ <dig> kb between the two. a small difference occurs in the case of bbzp <dig>  whereas we identified only one bbzp <dig> gene in the b. belcheri genome, two orthologs  were observed in b. floridae, arranged in a head-to-head orientation in scaffold bf_v2_ <dig> in the b. floridae genome, a scaffold that is distinct to bbzp1/ <dig> and bbzp2/ <dig>  a genomic comparison showed that the zp protein genes identified in this study are common to the genus branchiostoma. the cephalochordates comprise approximately  <dig> species that are divided into three genera: branchiostoma, epigonichthys and asymmetron <cit> . the distribution of these genes among other genera of cephalochordata requires further study.

in recent years, zp proteins have been characterized from urochordates, which are phylogenetically the closest relatives of vertebrates. notably, comparisons of the ms results of b. belcheri with those from c. intestinalis reveal that the number of zp proteins identified in this study is significantly less than those observed in c. intestinalis , which suggests that the number of zp protein genes in the basal chordate species might be fewer than those of the urochordates. in addition to the zp proteins, there are some non-zp proteins that might also be constituents of the egg coat, for example, vitellogenin and apolipoprotein b-like protein, which are also the known components of egg coats in urochordates
 <cit> . whereas mammals use zp proteins as the sole components to compose the zona pellucida matrix that surrounds the egg, the lower chordates appear more variable in selecting the egg coat composition.

zp proteins have been observed to be the major constituents of egg coats in diverse metazoan groups ; however the evolutionary relationship among zp proteins is not obvious. the identification of zp proteins as important components of the cephalochordate egg coats has filled a gap in the knowledge regarding chordate zp proteins and has enabled us to make conjectures regarding the evolutionary processes of zp proteins in chordates. both the sequence comparison  and zp domain tree  indicated that cephalochordate zp proteins are evolutionary homologues of the lamprey zp proteins and the zp <dig>  zp <dig> and zpax subtypes of the jawed vertebrates, which suggests a common ancestor for the two zp clades. therefore, vertebrate zps appeared to have an invertebrate origin  rather than an independent recruitment of zp domain containing proteins. however, the urochordate zp proteins appeared to be closer to the zp3/zpc subtypes of vertebrates . the phylogenetic tree of zp proteins from the three chordate subphyla indicated that the vertebrate zp subtypes had two recently separated common ancestors. in addition, except for the zp modules, which are the common structural domains of all metazoan zp types, the other domain components of the zp proteins from cephalochordates, urochordates and vertebrates are different. von wallebrand and repetitive egf domains are found in the egg coat zp proteins from cephalochordates and urochordates, respectively, which suggests different domain structures may be involved in gamete recognition in the two groups.

the high resolution structures of the mouse zp3
 <cit>  and zp-n domains
 <cit>  provided an understanding of the structural basis of sperm recognition in mammals. furthermore, the accumulating evidence suggests that the presence of repeated zp-n domains in the zp proteins, in addition to the universal zp-module, may well be associated with the sperm-binding activity
 <cit> . a recent threading analysis of the verl repeats in abalone zp proteins suggested that, similar to their zp <dig> counterparts, the verl repeats most likely adopt a zp-n fold, as shown by the complete conservation of four cysteine residues within each repeat
 <cit> . the domain architecture of the  <dig> bbzp proteins  shows that they possess neither the egf-like domain repeat nor the zp-n repeats. most of the lamprey zp proteins identified in this study are not full-length because of the low coverage of the current available genome. the full-length lamprey zp <dig> also lacks an apparent zp-n domain or an egf-like domain; therefore, whether or how the bbzp proteins and lamprey zp proteins function in sperm recognition during fertilization remains an open question that warrants further investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
by comprehensive proteomic analysis, followed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses, we identified five egg coat zp proteins from the cephalochordate b. belcheri. we also identified four zp proteins from the jawless vertebrate, the sea lamprey, which are highly similar to vertebrate zp subtypes. molecular phylogenetic analyses showed that the b. belcheri zp proteins form a distinct evolutionary clade but are homologous to both the lamprey and vertebrate zps in protein sequences. the study traces the evolutionary history of vertebrate sperm-egg recognition molecules to the appearance of basal chordate animals in the metazoan phylogeny.
