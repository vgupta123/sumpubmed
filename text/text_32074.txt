BACKGROUND
in livestock production, there is a high interest in controlling meat quantity and quality; knowledge about genes affecting muscle size and other meat properties can help breeders to select animals according to desired traits. myostatin  was first identified in knock-out mice as being a gene responsible for regulation of muscle growth  <cit> . however, the hypermuscular phenotype that originates from a hyperplasia and hypertrophy of muscle fibres was known long before its molecular-genetic background was elucidated  <cit> . in sheep, pigs and cattle, several mutations of myostatin or its promoter region have been identified as affecting muscle size  <cit> . furthermore, myostatin also influences glucose metabolism and fat accumulation, as shown in knock-out mice that had smaller adipocytes  <cit>  and did not develop obesity on a high-fat diet. these results suggested an altered metabolism for the utilization of lipids and glucose as energy fuel that prevented insulin resistance in mice  <cit> . a decreasing effect on intramuscular fat  content and carcass fat proportion was also described for the “double-muscled” phenotypes in cattle  <cit> , which was later found to be caused by a myostatin mutation as well. however, different myostatin mutations can cause different degrees of hypermuscularity. the most extreme form of this phenotype in cattle is seen in the belgian blue, while different mutations with less extreme phenotypes were identified in other breeds  <cit> .

due to its large implication, not only on skeletal muscles, a lot of research has been undertaken on the effects of myostatin and its possible applications in health care and livestock production. the myostatin-gene, for instance, appears to be a promising candidate for the treatment of muscle dystrophy diseases  <cit> , cardiac tissue regeneration or metabolic syndrome  <cit> . in livestock, efforts to manipulate the gene’s expression through immunization have been made for the purposes of higher lean mass production  <cit> . in accordance with this, modifiers of myostatin, such as follistatin , which inhibits myostatin, are currently under review as therapeutics  <cit> .

in the present study, we generated g3-populations of reciprocal crosses between two hypermuscular berlin muscle mouse inbred  lines to examine the genetic characteristics of myostatin and to find additional genes that could influence muscle growth and composition. the bmmi lines were hypermuscular as a result of long term selection that mirrors the selection process for high meat yield in livestock. the parental bmmi <dig> line originates from a population with the “compact” phenotype and therefore carries the known mstncmpt-dl1abc mutation  <cit> . although the bmmi <dig> line originates from the same founder population, it does not carry this mutation; bmmi <dig> animals display very high intramuscular fat contents, fat mass and fat proportion, especially in males  <cit> . previously, genetic modifier regions for the effect of the myostatin mstncmpt-dl1abc mutation on muscle mass have been identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x in a cross between comp <dig> and cast/ei lines  <cit> .

given that the bmmi lines were originally developed as supporting genetic models for livestock research, we were particularly interested in myostatin effects on intramuscular fat content  and water holding capacity  on the genetic background of high muscularity. we also analysed the extent to which sex and the direction of the reciprocal cross impacted on the traits of interest. the latter could indicate parent-of-origin effects, where the impact on the phenotype can be different depending on the parent from which an allele was inherited. for example, the polar over-dominance caused by the ovine callipyge locus, where a hypermuscular phenotype only occurs if the mutated allele is inherited from the sire  <cit> . parent-of-origin effects have also been described for body composition and fat-related traits in mice, pigs and cattle  <cit> .

in addition to the relationship between muscle mass and meat quality traits, we were also interested in certain parameters of the muscle and whole body metabolism such as muscle glycogen and lactate contents, blood glucose levels, and the carcass ph-values. for this purpose, we present the correlations between these traits in the g3-population. the linkage study did not reveal genomic loci accounting for variation of those metabolic traits.

RESULTS
phenotypes
as shown in table  <dig>  significant differences were found between the two parental lines. averaged over both sexes, the mstncmpt-dl1abc mutant bmmi <dig> animals showed 42%, 42%, 99% and 94% higher values for body weight, lean mass, m. longissimus and m. quadriceps masses than the bmmi <dig>  respectively. bmmi <dig> mice had 30% lower total fat percentage than bmmi <dig>  the imf contents of the m. longissimus and the m. quadriceps were 52% and 40% lower, respectively, as compared to the bmmi <dig> line. these data confirm the hypertrophic effect of the mstncmpt-dl1abc mutation and its impact on fat accumulation  <cit> . furthermore, fasting blood glucose levels of the bmmi <dig> line were 14% below the levels of bmmi <dig>  the decreased glucose levels of bmmi <dig> mice support the model of a metabolic shift towards the utilization of glucose as energy fuel if myostatin is not fully functional, as shown by experiments in cell cultures  <cit> . regarding differences between the sexes, male bmmi <dig> mice had lower carcass ph-values after  <dig> hour and female bmmi <dig> mice showed lower carcass ph-values after  <dig> hours post-mortem compared to bmmi <dig> .

trait abbreviations: imf = intramuscular fat content, whc = water holding capacity , ml = musculus longissimus, mq = musculus quadriceps, glucose = blood glucose level. phenotypes of the parental lines are compared with each other and the f <dig> and g <dig>  separated for sex. asterisks indicate significant differences between the parental lines; letters indicate significant differences between the f <dig> or g <dig> and bmmi <dig>  or bmmi <dig>  lines. number of asterisks and letters show levels of significance .

comparing the f <dig> and g3-population with the parental lines, we found intermediate values for body weight, lean mass and muscle masses. dominance of the bmmi <dig> characteristics was indicated for total fat percentage in the f <dig> population. while the imf values of both sexes of f <dig> animals and the males of the g <dig> population were intermediate, in female g <dig> animals, the measurements of total fat percentage and imf of the m. longissimus were similar to the lower values of the bmmi <dig> line. fasting blood glucose levels indicated a dominance of the bmmi <dig> line alleles, whereas the bmmi <dig> phenotype was found prevalent for the higher carcass ph-values for  <dig> hour post mortem.

correlations
in the g3-population, high positive correlations in males and females were observed between muscle mass and total lean mass  and negative correlations with body fat percentage  and imf . in females, muscle mass was also negatively correlated with whc in m. quadriceps , whilst in males, no correlation was found. furthermore, in males, higher muscle mass was associated with lower ph-values  <dig> hours post mortem . nevertheless, in both sexes negative correlations were evident between muscle glycogen contents and the ph-values of  <dig> and  <dig> hours post mortem , and between whc and the ph-value after  <dig> hours . the muscle glycogen content was associated with the body fat content , but was not correlated with the blood glucose levels; higher muscle glycogen contents were found in leaner animals.

trait abbreviations: imf = intramuscular fat content, whc = water holding capacity, measured as ‘drip loss’ in percent of muscle weight, ml = m. longissimus, mq = m. quadriceps. glucose = blood glucose level; asterisks indicate the significance of correlations: *** p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , * p <  <dig> , .p <  <dig> .

the results regarding the carcass ph-value and whc confirm studies in pigs, where a low ph-value negatively affects whc and leads to high drip loss. the low whc is likely the result of a developing acidic environment that affects the proteolysis of cell scaffold proteins  <cit> . in turn, the acidic environment is caused by high intramuscular glycogen contents that promote the development of high lactate levels via glycolysis  <cit> . the negative correlation between muscle glycogen and body fat content as well as imf of the m. longissimus in males supports the model of a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. the non-significant correlation with fasting blood glucose levels is likely due to the short fasting period of two hours before measurements leading to a high variability.

qtl analysis
due to the relative small number of animals in our g3-population, we could only detect regions with larger effects. two genome-wide significant qtl were identified . the first one was located on chromosome   <dig> at  <dig> mb  in a region that contains the previously described myostatin mstncmpt-dl1abc mutation, located at  <dig> mb . in the g3-population, the bmmi <dig> allele at this locus caused additive effects of  <dig>  g for body weight and  <dig>  g for lean mass. it also increased the masses of the m. longissimus and m. quadriceps muscles by  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g, respectively . the body fat percentage was decreased by the bmmi <dig> allele by  <dig>  points. a similar effect was observed for imf where the bmmi <dig> allele had a decreasing effect of  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentage points for imf values of the m. longissimus and m. quadriceps, respectively .

 <dig> g <dig> phenotypic variance  explained by the qtl; qtl effect given as the reduction of the residual sum of squares fitting  <dig> vs.  <dig> qtl.

an additional qtl was identified on chr <dig> at  <dig> mb  that decreased the total fat mass by  <dig>  g in heterozygous animals . this is a negative heterosis effect where heterozygous animals have significantly lower t values than either homozygous class. this significant negative dominance for fat mass at the chr.  <dig> qtl is interesting because it is in contrast to the phenotypic observation that male f <dig> and g <dig> individuals tended to have a higher fat mass than the mean of to the parental lines . the general positive heterosis of the offspring lines points to other loci with effects on fat mass that could not be detected in this study. the qtl on chromosome  <dig> showed no linkage with imf, which indicates a specific role in adipose tissue for this region in mice. an interaction between the chr <dig> and the chr <dig> locus was not observed, and thus our data provides evidence that the region on chr <dig> is an independent regulator of total fat mass. up to now only one marker in that region, the d16mit <dig> at  <dig> mb, was proposed provisionally by srivastava et al.  as causative for variation in total fat mass in mice.

the qtl for fat mass on chr <dig> is located within a region from 75– <dig> mb that is syntenic with a region in pigs on sus scrofa chromosome   <dig> . according to the animal genome database  this region contains qtl for marbling, back fat and for imf  <cit> . dominance effects for fat mass, as they were found in our study, were not significant for the syntenic region in pigs, however a positive dominance was found for ham weight  <cit> . thus, this syntenic locus could possibly have a negative dominance effect on fat mass because muscle weight and fat weight are often negatively correlated. furthermore, similar effects were observed for the syntenic region in cattle. in cattle, this region is divided into two parts which reside on chromosome  <dig>  between 0– <dig> mb and 141– <dig> mb. within those two regions on bta <dig>  fat related qtl were mapped for milk fat yield, marbling and fat thickness at the 12th rib  <cit> . a positive but non-significant dominance effect on adjusted subcutaneous fat thickness was reported in cattle  <cit> . finally, the syntenic region in the human genome resides on chromosome  <dig> at 15– <dig> mb. the human obesity gene map counts four obesity-associated loci in this syntenic region  <cit> . assuming that the same gene is underlying the variation across species, further refinement of the murine chr <dig> regions seems promising and our study adds to the confirmation of mice as a model animal to study meat quality traits in livestock or muscular disorders in humans.

as we did not find any other loci affecting muscle mass apart from the myostatin locus, we assume that several or many small effect alleles that contribute to these traits and that have been shown in other crosses  <cit>  are hidden in our study behind the strong effect of myostatin, in particular in the hypermuscular line bmmi <dig>  another reason could be that the statistical power was not sufficient in the examined population.

effects of sex and direction-of-cross
as shown in table  <dig>  sex affected all traits for all identified qtl. males significantly increased body weight, lean mass, and the masses of the m. longissimus and m. quadriceps by  <dig>  g,  <dig>  g,  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g, respectively. in males, the total fat mass and the total fat percentage were also raised by  <dig>  g and  <dig>  points, respectively. sex also affected imf values of the two examined muscles, which were increased by  <dig>  points and  <dig>  points for the m. longissimus and the m. quadriceps in males, respectively. the increase in the lean mass related traits was expected as a sex difference; however, the increase in fat mass percentage in male mice was a new observation. an explanation could be that male bmmi <dig> mice display very high fat values  and the high-fat phenotype in g3-males is thought to be inherited by the bmmi <dig> alleles of both qtls.

interestingly, for the myostatin locus, we also found significant effects of the direction-of-cross and an interaction between sex and the direction-of-cross on imf of the m. quadriceps . animals derived from mating a female bmmi <dig> with a male bmmi <dig> showed higher body weight, lean mass and muscle mass at the chr <dig> locus in comparison to animals of the reciprocal cross. while total fat mass, fat percentage and imf of the m. longissimus were not significantly affected, we observed a large increase of imf in the m. quadriceps by  <dig>  points in male g3-animals that were derived from a mating between a female bmmi <dig> and a male bmmi <dig> . this means that in male g3-animals descending from a bmmi <dig> grand-grandfather, myostatin expressed less of its imf decreasing effect. furthermore, the effects of myostatin were generally larger in g3-animals descending from a male bmmi <dig> parent of the initial cross.

as a likely result of the recent selection and inbreeding process, snp data of the mitochondrial dna and the y-chromosome did not differ between the two parental lines. therefore, we assumed that mitochondria and y-chromosomes did not account for trait differences between reciprocal crosses. nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude hidden mutations derived during the breeding history. such hidden mutations do not play a role for mitochondria, but might affect y-chromosomal effects. however, so far, no y-chromosomal effects on traits that we analysed in this study have been identified. therefore, the phenotypic differences between the reciprocal crosses are likely parent-of-origin effects.

the high imf values for the qtl on chr <dig>  for g3-males of the cross between a bmmi <dig> female and a bmmi <dig> male, were very similar to males of the parental line bmmi <dig>  this was not observed in the reciprocal cross and therefore, might result from parent-of-origin effects. since evidence is growing that parent-of-origin effects could exist over several generations  <cit>  our findings suggest epigenetic patterns, which alter the gene expression of the chromosomes according to the ancestor they were inherited from. whether the myostatin locus alone underlies genetic imprinting, or additional loci that did not directly affect the analysed traits, still has to be tested in a genome-wide screen.

recently, we have identified bidirectional parent-of-origin effects for muscle glycogen content and glycolytic potential as well as body weight in a population between two other hypermuscular mouse lines bfmi <dig> × bmmi <dig>  <cit> . the imprinted loci were not discovered by a genome-wide qtl search directly for additive and dominance effects.

in sheep with the callipyge mutation, the callipyge phenotype was not expressed in homozygous mutated animals  <cit> . it was suggested that the maternal inactivation of the locus also negatively affected the paternal expression, but a paternally inherited mutated locus escapes the inactivation in the presence of a maternally inherited wild-type allele and leads to the callipygous phenotype. phenomenon like this have their molecular origin in a dna methylation ‘reset’ that occurs during gametogenesis, the fusion of oocyte and spermatocyte in the zygote and the following early embryogenesis  <cit> . as seen in the callipyge sheep example, small genetic differences can affect the reprogramming processes and lead to different gene expression patterns and phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
the strong effects of the myostatin mutation mstncmpt-dl1abc on high muscle and low fat mass were confirmed, even in a background of high muscularity in a cross between two hypermuscular mouse lines. the data provides evidence for sex and very likely parent-of-origin effects modifying the direct effects of the myostatin locus on muscle mass and imf in m. quadriceps. however, further tests are necessary to confirm imprinting effects. in addition to the myostatin locus, we have shown that a region on chr  <dig> affecting fat mass is conserved between mice, pig and cattle showing effects on body fat, marbling and milk fat. furthermore, many reported observations and correlations of the post mortem physiology of livestock were reproduced in our mice.

the results obtained in this study help to justify the mouse model to study economically relevant livestock traits. new information from the mouse model helps to describe variation in meat quantity and quality and thus supports research in livestock.
