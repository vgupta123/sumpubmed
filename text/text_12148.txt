BACKGROUND
high-to-medium-resolution structures of the ribosome have by their ability to generate structure-based functional hypotheses radically changed the way the ribosome is studied. one of the more intriguing results that has come from structural studies is the extraordinary number of roles attributed to a single  <dig> nt helix-loop, h <dig> of 23s rrna . crystallographic studies of the thermus thermophilus ribosome  <cit>  and cryo-em studies of e. coli ribosomes  <cit>  have made it evident that h <dig> is a component of both the a and p sites with an ability to simultaneously contact two trnas. it contacts the d-stem and d-stem junction of the a site trna by the loop residues 1913– <dig> and the same parts of the p site trna by backbone-backbone interactions with stem nucleotides  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  . in addition, h <dig> loop residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contact 16s rrna h <dig>  thus forming the intersubunit bridge b2a  <cit> . chemical cross-linking and footprinting data further corroborates the close proximity of h <dig> to intersubunit contact area  <cit> . the importance of h <dig> in subunit association is emphasized by the recent finding that dms-modifications of a <dig> or a <dig>  abolish 70s formation in an in vitro test system  <cit> . also, hydroxyl-radical footprinting of the anti-subunit-association factor if <dig> on the 30s subunit implicates if <dig> binding to the region that is occupied by the loop of h <dig> in 70s ribosomes  <cit> , suggesting that disallowing of the bridge b2a may be important for keeping the subunits separate before correct initiation of translation.

since h <dig> adopts a different conformation in 50s subunits and 70s ribosomes, it has to change conformation upon 30s binding  <cit> . conformational flexibility of h <dig> may also be important in translocation since it is hard to imagine trna movement from a to p site with h <dig> stuck in its path. an active role for h <dig> in translocation has been proposed  <cit>  but has not yet been experimentally tested. in addition to interactions with trnas and the 30s subunit, contacts of h <dig> with various a site substrates have been proposed. based on cryo-em reconstitution of the ribosome with bound aa-trna-ef-tu-gdp-kirromycin, valle et al. speculate that trna contacts with h <dig> might actively promote the observed kink in trna structure  <cit> . cryo-em studies have also led to proposals of h <dig> contacts with eef <dig>  <cit> , rf <dig>  <cit> , rf <dig>  <cit> , rrf  <cit>  and smpb in the ala-tmrna-smpb-ef-tu-kirromycin complex  <cit> .

another interesting feature of the h <dig> is its three pseudouridines at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . they are synthesized by a single synthase, rlud, which is the only pseudouridine synthase in e. coli whose deletion leads to a strong growth defect  <cit> . defective rlud function leads to impaired ribosome assembly  <cit> . this observation suggests that h <dig> actively promotes the process of ribosomal large subunit assembly.

o'connor and dahlberg selected three mutations in h <dig>  that cause increased + <dig> and - <dig> frameshifting and read-through of all three stop codons  <cit> . here we mutate each residue in the loop of h <dig> and analyze the growth phenotypes, assembly of the mutant ribosomes, their incorporation into polysomes and activities in poly-uridine-directed poly-phenylalanine synthesis. the results obtained in this work point to residues a <dig>  a <dig>  Ψ  <dig> and a <dig> as important for correct functioning of the e. coli ribosome.

RESULTS
experimental design
because of the crucial nature of protein synthesis for cellular viability and the perceived importance of 23s rrna helix  <dig> for correct functioning of the ribosome, its mutations are likely to be lethal. therefore, we used inducible expression to study in vivo phenotypes of mutations in 23s rrna. mutated 23s rrna genes were expressed from the plasmid ptbsb under the control of iptg-inducible tac promoter  <cit> . in order to be able to quantify the fraction of mutant 23s rrna in ribosomes and to functionally differentiate between plasmid-borne and chromosomally encoded ribosomes during in vitro translation, the single mutations were combined with the second site mutation a1067u in the plasmid ptbsb1067t. this mutation confers resistance to thiostrepton during cell free translation  <cit> . therefore, a1067u enables to discriminate the activity of chromosomally encoded wild-type ribosomes from mutant ribosomes containing plasmid-encoded 23s rrna. 30–40% of the cellular ribosome pool contain mutant 23s rrna  <cit> . we constructed the following mutations in the loop of h69: Ψ1911c, a1912g, a1913g, c1914a, Ψ1915c, a1916g, Ψ1917c, a1918g and a1919g.

effect of mutations on cell growth
mutant 23s rrna expression was induced with  <dig> mm iptg in xl- <dig> cells growing in rich liquid media at 37°c in the early exponential growth phase. the plasmid, carrying 23s rrna gene with the single mutation a1067u, was used as a control. the expression of 23s rrna genes containing mutations a1912g, Ψ1917c and a1919g resulted in very strong growth inhibition 2– <dig> hrs post-induction leading to a complete cessation of cell growth well below the cell densities, which were reached by uninduced cultures . induction of 23s rrna variants carrying mutations Ψ1915c and a1916g resulted in modestly increased doubling times but nevertheless allowed the cultures to reach maximal cell densities similar to uninduced cultures . mutations Ψ1911c, a1913g, c1914a and a1918g had little or no effect on growth .

incorporation of mutant 23s rrna into poly-ribosomes
quantitative monitoring of the proportion of mutant 23s rrnas in translating polysomes, initiating 70s ribosomes and translationally idle 50s subunits enables us to assign defects in translation to the initiation phase  or the elongation phase  of translation. furthermore, possible changes in relative sizes of the polysome, 70s or 50s fractions can provide useful information on translational competency of the mutant cells. in addition, changes in the overall shape and number of the peaks can point to defects in ribosome assembly.

the marker-mutation a1067u was used to determine the fraction of mutant 23s rrna. ribosomes were fractionated by 15%-40% sucrose gradient centrifugation and rrna was extracted from tetrasome, trisome, disome, 70s and 50s fractions. relative proportions of plasmid-encoded and chromosomally encoded rrnas were determined by a standard primer extension assay  <cit> .

expression of the single mutation a1067u 23s rrna variant results in around 45% of the polysome and 70s pools consisting of mutant ribosomes . 23s rrna variant a1912g is under-represented in polysomes, but not in the 70s ribosomes . its progressively larger deprivation in larger polysomes  is consistent with defects in the elongation phase of translation of the mutant ribosomes rather than, for example, in a late initiation step.

mutation a1913g exhibits a modest counter-selection of mutant ribosomes in the polysome fractions reaching approximately two-fold deprivation in the tetrasomes .

23s rrna variant Ψ1917c exhibits a relatively modest fractional deprivation in polysomes and in 70s ribosomes . interestingly, it leads to a large reduction in the amount of polysomes; indeed so large that we were unable to collect tetrasomes for analysis. therefore, expression of this mutant must reduce the ability of the wild-type ribosomes to engage in translation.

mutation a1919g leads to a modest deprivation of plasmid borne 23s rrna in the 70s ribosomes, in addition to a large progressive deprivation in the polysomes fractions . this is, once again, suggestive of a mostly elongation-level defect in translation by the mutant ribosomes. in addition, expression of the 23s rrna variant a1919g led to appearance of an extra gradient peak, corresponding to particles sedimenting approximately as 40s . however, the amount of the 40s particles varied widely between experiments from nonexistent to nearly the levels of the 50s subunits . in spite of the variable results we tentatively suggest that the mutation a1919g affects 50s subunit assembly.

23s rrna variant a1916g exhibits a large deprivation in 70s ribosomes and is nearly absent in polysomes . in addition, 23s rrna variant a1916g reproducibly exhibited enlarged and widened 50s peak, suggestive of conformational heterogeneity in the 50s population . conformational heterogeneity can be caused by a defect in ribosomal large subunit assembly. it is possible that the transition a1916g confers a defect of ribosome large subunit assembly. on the other hand, lack of 23s rrna variant a1916g in the 70s and polysome fractions can be caused by a defect in association with the 30s subunit, which in turn can cause an initiation defect.

expression of mutations Ψ1911c, c1914a, Ψ1915c or a1918g did not lead to significant changes in the fraction of mutant ribosomes or in the appearances of the gradient profiles .

cell-free translation of poly by mutant ribosomes
for in vitro translation, tight-couple 70s ribosomes were isolated from induced xl <dig> lysates by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. the second site mutation, a1067u, confers thiostrepton resistance to plasmid-borne 50s ribosomes enabling studies of the cell free translation of mutant ribosomes through inactivation of the wild-type ribosomes by thiostrepton. in the presence of five-fold molar excess of thiostrepton, poly-directed translation of wild-type ribosomes was inhibited by 97–99%  <cit> . the ribosomes isolated from induced cells that harbor plasmid-encoded a1067u mutant 23s rrna exhibited 30% thiostrepton resistance during poly translation . if a1912g, a1916g or a1919g mutation was added as the second mutation to the a1067u, thiostrepton-resistance dropped to nearly zero . this means that ribosomes harboring mutations at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are completely inactive in the poly-directed translation system. mutation Ψ1917c causes a three-fold reduction in poly synthesis of the mutant ribosomes . mutation Ψ1915c cause a two-fold reduction in cell-free translation capability of the mutant ribosomes . mutation a1913g exhibits slightly reduced levels in poly translation. mutations Ψ1911c, c1914a and a1918g have no effect on poly translation.

discussion
we have dissected the function of the helix-loop  <dig> of 23s rrna by subjecting mutants of its loop residues to various functional tests. the results of assays of cell growth, polysome incorporation, and cell-free translation pointed to the same mutations  as seriously compromised. however, the phenotypes of the aforementioned mutations fall into three distinct types.

first, mutations at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are defective in the elongation phase of protein synthesis, both having reduced amounts of mutant ribosomes in the polysomes, but are abundant in the 70s ribosomes. the gradual decrease of the a1912g and a1919g ribosomes in successive polysomal fractions is consistent with placement of one mutant ribosome per mrna. this can happen when the mutant ribosomes are able to initiate translation but cannot undergo into elongation phase. the mutant ribosomes are also completely inactive during in vitro translation, showing that the under-representation of mutant ribosomes in cellular polysomes is a direct consequence of the inactivity of the mutant ribosomes. although mutant ribosomes are largely excluded from the polysomes, the total amount of polysomes in the relevant sucrose gradient fractions is not appreciably reduced . it should be noted that expression of 30–40% of mutant ribosomes in the background of wild-type ribosomes rapidly leads to a complete cessation of cell growth. it is likely that this pseudo-dominant phenotype is caused by "choking" of the translation by freezing the ribosomes  on the cellular mrnas.

second, as indicated by the widened 50s peak in the sucrose gradient, ribosomes carrying the mutation a1916g are structurally heterogeneous and thus apparently defective in the assembly of mutant 50s subunits. this conjecture is further supported by the strongly reduced activity of the mutant ribosomes in cell free translation and by their strong counter-selection in the 70s ribosome pool. yet this mutation leads only to a modest retardation in cell growth. therefore, complete inactivation of the mutant ribosomes in the wild-type background is not in itself detrimental to cell growth.

third, the Ψ1917c mutation leads to relatively modest effects in cell free translation and in the fractions of mutant ribosomes in the polysomes. therefore, unlike for a1912g and a1919g, the induction of Ψ1917c-carrying 23s rrna does not freeze the ribosomes  on mrnas. yet it leads to a complete stop in cell growth 3– <dig> hours after the induction of mutant 23s rrna synthesis. the Ψ1917c is also the only mutation that leads to a clearly reduced polysome pool  <dig> hours after induction. we believe that this reduction in the ability of both mutant and wild-type ribosomes to enter the polysome pool could explain the observed drastic growth defect by strong reduction in the cellular protein synthesis levels. such an effect could, in principle, be achieved by sequestering of an essential factor for translation by the mutant ribosomes.

a number of nucleotides in the loop of helix  <dig> have been implicated in binding of the a site trna  and as components of the intersubunit bridge b2a  based on structural  <cit>  and modification interference  <cit>  studies . surprisingly, of the aforementioned five nucleotides, only the mutation a1912g exhibited a strong phenotype. the dms-modification of the n <dig> position of a <dig> was previously shown to be detrimental to 70s ribosome formation in vitro  <cit> . however, the a1912g mutation seems to exert its strong effect on translation at the level of elongation, rather than by inhibiting 70s ribosome formation . therefore, we failed to confirm the functional importance of any of the proposed h <dig> contacts with trna or the ssu by the mutagenesis approach. this is reminiscent of the results of o'connor and dahlberg who disrupted the stem of h <dig> by introducing a c1909:c <dig> mismatch and found no growth effect or defects in translation  <cit> . yet, this disruption should fall squarely in the middle of the h <dig> backbone-to-backbone contact area with the p site bound trna  <cit>  . also, of the three conserved pseudouridines in h <dig>  only mutation of the Ψ <dig> has a strong effect. notably, out of three pseudouridine residues in this region, only the Ψ <dig> is universally conserved  <cit> . thus, Ψ <dig> is likely to have a unique function.

sucrose gradient pattern suggested that the mutation a1916g affects 50s assembly. as the h <dig> forms a spindle-like structure on the interface side of the large subunit  <cit> , it is difficult to imagine how the mutation in the loop region could affect 50s structure, and thereby its assembly. on the other hand, a1916g transition can affect ribosomal subunit interaction. it is possible that association of the subunits is important for final maturation of the 50s subunits.

CONCLUSIONS
we scanned the loop of helix  <dig> by mutagenesis and analyzed the mutant ribosomes using a plasmid-borne iptg-inducible expression system. we assayed the effects of 23s rrna mutations on cell growth, contribution of mutant ribosomes to cellular polysome pools and the ability of mutant ribosomes to engage in cell-free translation. mutations a1912g, and a1919g have very strong growth phenotypes, are inactive during in vitro protein synthesis and are under-represented in the polysomes. mutation Ψ1917c has a very strong growth phenotype and leads to a general depletion of the cellular polysome pool. mutation a1916g, having a modest growth phenotype, is apparently defective in the assembly of the mutant 50s subunits or in the 70s formation.
