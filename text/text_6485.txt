BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is responsible for approximately  <dig>  million deaths each year and is considered a global health emergency by the world health organization . portugal is the western european country that over the last few decades has had one of the highest tb notification rates in europe   <cit> . although this rate is considered intermediate, the difficulty is the growing threat of drug resistance. in particular, the two most difficult-to-treat forms: multidrug-resistance , and rifampicin ) and extensive drug resistance , and a second-line injectable drug)  <cit> .

the tb situation in the capital city, lisbon  has been extensively studied . laboratory data on resistance prevalence point to high xdr-tb rates in the region, which in recent years have ranged between  <dig> - <dig> % of the mdr-tb clinical isolates  <cit> .genotyping studies using is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism , spoligotyping, and more recently, through the characterization of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units – variable number of tandem repeats , have led to the identification of a family of close genetic clusters in the 90’s: the lisboa family, highly associated with mdr- and now xdr-tb  <cit> .the lisboa family has been defined a group of strains/clusters sharing a similar rflp-is <dig> profile , belonging to the lam lineage and/or sharing a similarity rate of at least 95% when genotyped by 12-loci miru-vntr  <cit> . the prevalence of this family in the region may account to up to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mdr- and xdr-tb cases, respectively  <cit> .

another genetically close and endemic cluster, also belonging to the lam lineage, named q <dig> also plays an important role in mdr- and xdr-tb in the region and its impact on public health and drug-resistant tb in the region has been addressed in previous publications  <cit> . when genotyped by 12-loci miru-vntr, the q <dig> cluster strains have been shown to share  <dig> miru-vntr loci alleles with the most important lisboa cluster  but yet, bearing distinct mutational profiles on rpsl, rrs and gyra genes  <cit> . a characteristic deletion of spacers 38– <dig> in the direct repeat locus has also been observed alongside with a characteristic spoligotyping lam signature . recently, mutation a80p in the gidb gene, responsible for low-level streptomycin  resistance, has been proposed as a marker for q <dig> strains  <cit> .

the etiologic agents of tb are the bacterial species belonging to mycobacterium tuberculosis complex , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis sensu stricto  or mycobacterium bovis <cit> . m. tuberculosis has been regarded for many years as a genetically monomorphic pathogen. nevertheless, the high-throughput genomic sequencing of diverse clinical strains has revealed a higher degree of variation than initially anticipated . next-generation sequencing  technology is allowing new insights on the mode of transmission and evolution of the mtc  <cit> . furthermore, the ability to compare, at the genomic level, identical strains in different stages of resistance acquisition can also provide new data on the genomic adaptation and compensation to the fixation of resistance-associated mutations in the host’s bacilli population  <cit> .

in this regard, the genomic determinants of the lisboa family and q <dig> strains are yet to be characterized. in the present study, we have genotyped and sequenced the genomes of 56 m. tuberculosis clinical isolates  with the aim of gaining insights into the genomic diversity and microevolution of prevalent mdr- and xdr-tb circulating strains in the lisbon region.

RESULTS
of 56 m. tuberculosis isolates studied,  <dig>  were resistant to inh and rif and were therefore classified as mdr-tb isolates, of which we were able to determine the resistance to second-line drugs for  <dig> isolates. in total,  <dig> mdr-tb isolates were also classified as xdr-tb .table  <dig>

genotypic analysis
the 24-loci miru-vntr genotyping technique grouped the mdr-tb isolates into three major clusters: lisboa3-a, lisboa3-b and q <dig> . use of the 12-loci set groups lisboa3-a and -b in a single cluster . only the lisboa3-b and q <dig> clusters were found to be associated with xdr-tb isolates. eight of the ten xdr-tb isolates belonged to either lisboa3-b or q <dig> cluster, and one of remaining two strains was found to be q1-related, raising the possibility of ancestral q <dig> xdr followed by posterior divergence from this cluster. no xdr-tb isolate was found to belong to lisboa3-a cluster.figure  <dig>

genomic analysis
all  <dig> clinical isolates underwent whole genome sequencing  the total number of identified snps  ranged between 488– <dig>  . of the snps on coding regions,  <dig> % were considered non-synonymous substitutions yielding a mean non-synonymous/synonymous ratio  of  <dig>  . ag, ct, ga and tc transitions were found to be the most frequent substitution types , which is reflected by a mean transversion/transition ratio  of  <dig> . overall, across the  <dig> clinical isolates and  <dig> publicly available reference strains ,  <dig> genome-wide snps were identified by mapping to the reference genome of m. tuberculosis h37rv. the number of small insertions and deletions  detected upon read mapping ranged between 15– <dig> indels per isolate with a size between 1–59 bp .

global phylogenetic analysis using wgs
using wgs data, the  <dig> clinical isolates and  <dig> publicly available strains were assigned into established six snp clusters groups  and three principal genetic groups   <cit> . overall, at least one isolate belonging to each scg and subgroups was included in the subsequent analysis. forty-four  of the  <dig> clinical isolates belonged to scg  <dig>  reflecting the high prevalence of these strains in lisbon health region .

a phylogenetic tree was inferred from a set of  <dig> genome-wide snps . it reveals that the two main genetic clusters associated with xdr-tb in the region, q <dig> and lisboa <dig>  constitute two genetically close but distinct clades within the scg  <dig>  the miru-vntr lisboa3-a cluster was found to form a monophyletic group within the lisboa <dig> clade. the miru-vntr lisboa3-b clade designation was therefore considered as paraphyletic in the light of a genome-wide snp phylogeny. the sequenced strain closest to the lisboa3-q <dig> clade is m. tuberculosis ut <dig>  a virulent colombian isolate that according with the present phylogeny shares a more recent common ancestor with q <dig> strains than these do with lisboa <dig> strains.figure  <dig>

global evolution through large sequence polymorphisms
genomes in the m. tuberculosis complex can downsize, through large sequence polymorphisms  or regions of difference , and  <dig> have been previously identified . across the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were detected as absent in at least one isolate . the most prevalent rds detected were rd <dig> , rd <dig> , rd <dig> , rd <dig> , rd <dig>  and rdrio . as expected, all  <dig> strains bearing the rd <dig>  deletion also had the rdrio deletion  <cit> . both deletions constitute a distinct sub-lineage within the euro-american lineage  <cit>  and were detected only among scg  <dig> strains. ut <dig>  like the q <dig> and lisboa  <dig> samples, had both deletions, confirming its phylogenetic proximity with these m/xdr associated strains .

all nine isolates from the scg  <dig> had the rd <dig> deletion characteristic of the east-asian clade. of these, other rd deletions were present . moreover, other rd deletions associated with specific lineages were detected: rd <dig> , rd <dig> , rd <dig>  rd <dig> , rd <dig> , rd <dig> ) and rd <dig> .

no rd region was found to be absent in rgtb <dig> and only rdrio deletion was detected in rgtb <dig>  strain rgtb <dig> has been found to belong to scg  <dig> and pgg  <dig>  <cit> , but in-silico pcr analysis showed that the strain had the pks15/ <dig> 7 bp frameshift deletion and the tbd <dig> deletion indicative of a modern euro-american strain  <cit> . nevertheless, this classification is incongruent with the scg and pgg classification  <cit> . on the other hand, rgtb <dig> was found to have the rdrio deletion only and in silico pcr of the pks15/ <dig> and tbd <dig> loci also pointed towards a modern euro-american strain, despite the fact that deletion rd <dig> was not detected. further sequencing of these two assembled strains may be required to resolve incongruences.

other structural variants were also searched employing different methodologies . from the deletions described in the supplementary material we highlight characteristic deletions for the lisboa <dig> clade and the ars <dig> isolate  , as well as the q <dig> clade strains . both deletions were also validated by mapping coverage, but further laboratory confirmation is required.figure  <dig>

microevolution towards multidrug and extensively drug resistance
given the relative high number of sequenced strains present in both lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades it was possible to trace the microevolutionary path reflecting the genomic changes accompanying the resistance acquisition process. we considered the subtrees containing the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades plus one or two strains for the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> subtrees, respectively, included as outgroups for the ensuing analysis . in particular, we inferred the changes in candidate resistant gene mutations at the nodes of the trees.figure  <dig>

the lisboa <dig> subtree, including the outgroup strain ars <dig>  was found to be characterized by a 5 bp deletion on the inia gene. there is a common acquisition of high-level inh resistance through a inha double mutation . the data also reflect the acquisition of rif resistance in three separate occasions, twice in the lisboa3-b strains by a rpob s450l  and in lisboa3-a lineage by a rpob d435v . acquisition of xdr can be seen in the two branches: the first by acquisition of an eis g-10a, gyra s91p and tlya ins755gt mutations ; and, by an eis g-10a and gyra d94g mutations . emb resistance is likely to have been acquired twice by embb m306v and p397t mutations. the latter mutation has been previously reported in one emb resistant isolate  <cit> . pza resistance was found to be acquired on multiple independent occasions through pnca mutations.

the q <dig> subtree included two other q1-related strains as outgroups. here, it is possible to distinguish the acquisition of inh low-level resistance by an inha c-15 t mutation  from the acquisition of a higher inh resistance level by an inha missense mutation   <cit> . some of the isolates present in the subtree were found outside the q <dig> miru-vntr cluster, but share more recent common ancestors with other strains in the clade, potentially indicating subsequent miru-vntr divergence. the q <dig> clade has, therefore, been defined as all isolates bearing the gidb a80p mutation characteristic of this cluster and associated with stp intermediate-level resistance previously described by some of us  <cit> . a more linear resistance acquisition dynamic was found for this clade. emb resistance was acquired on two possible occasions, through an embb m423t  and m306v  mutations. rif resistance development, leading to mdr-tb, was found to be acquired by a rpob s450l mutation , although a second mutation on rpob  was later developed . resistance to pza, injectable second-line drugs and fqs occurred once by mutations on pnca , rrs  and gyra , respectively. interestingly, isolates ihmt308_ <dig> and ihmt361_ <dig> did not show the two latter mutations in rrs and gyra genes, and therefore inconsistent with both strains positioning in the q <dig> subtree.

a further observation is that m/xdr development in the lisboa <dig> subtree appeared to be accompanied by a higher genomic diversification, translated in the number of snps and small indels . this observation is probably in line with an earlier emergence of the lisboa <dig> clade and prolonged circulation in the community leading to a higher intra-clade diversity when compared to q <dig> strains. moreover, isolates from the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades were found to bear a mean proportion of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  unique snps, respectively, in comparison with the total snp count of each strain. both clades were found to share a pool of  <dig>  and  <dig>  common snps, respectively . this intra-cluster degree of genomic uniqueness is comparable with the data reported by niemann et al. for the comparison of two beijing isolates from the same outbreak clone  <cit> .

mutational compensation for rif-resistance
the acquisition of compensatory mutations following resistance development has been proposed as a possible mechanism to reduce the fitness cost carried by drug resistance  <cit> . more recently, rpoa and rpoc genes were found to harbor putative rif resistance compensatory mutations  <cit> . the microevolutionary analysis of lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades led to the identification of two possible compensatory mutations in rpoc  and rpob  leading to rif resistance acquisition. the rpoa and rpoc genes were screened for mutations in all isolates. on the overall  <dig> different non-synonymous mutations were found, of which only  <dig> occurred among mdr/rif-resistance isolates . the impact on protein function was inferred by computation of sift scores  <cit> . only three mutations occurring in rpoc  were predicted to affect protein function with sift scores equal to  <dig> , resulting from the comparison of  <dig> sequences represented at each position . the remaining mutations were predicted to be tolerated and yielded higher sift scores , resulting from the comparison of 171– <dig> sequences representing each position tested .table  <dig>

we also screened the remaining rna polymerase subunits, rpob and rpoz, but only eight non-synonymous mutations were identified in rpob, concomitantly with other rif resistance associated mutations in rpob . five rpob mutations  were predicted to affect protein function after sift score analysis  .

insertion sequence  mapping and functional consequences for genomic stability
transposition events from iss can have a profound effect on strain physiology given the possibility of interference with gene expression by orf knock-out or gene upregulation resulting from upstream transposition  <cit> . for all strains included in the phylogenetic analysis, we attempted to map the site of all iss annotated as mobile elements in the genome of m. tuberculosis h37rv, namely is <dig>  some complex inversions were found to be predominantly transpositional events from multi-copy mobile-elements, such as is <dig>  the analysis revealed the presence of is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> in multiple copies, but differing in size or annotated sequence at both extremities. for this reason these iss have been excluded from the mapping analysis.

variability was only observed for is <dig> and is <dig> . as expected, is <dig> was not detected in all isolates bearing the rdrio deletion, whereas is <dig> is absent in isolates bearing the rd <dig> deletion found on different scgs. for is <dig>  a total of  <dig> candidate insertion sites have been obtained , classified as of high , medium  or lesser  confidence. almost half ) of the  <dig> iss were observed on the positive strand. a total of  <dig>  insertion sites were found to be intergenic, from which  <dig>  were in the same orientation with an upstream orf, known to exert a putative upregulatory effect. for these latter insertion sites the distance from the 3′ end to the upstream orf ranged between 0–939 bp  less than 300 bp). thirty-three sites were found to be within pe/ppe genes, while three other insertion sites were located 18–38 bp upstream of a ppe gene.

lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades were found to share  <dig> is <dig> sites but were differentiated by is <dig> insertions on positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  for lisboa <dig> and, on  <dig>  for q <dig> isolates . moreover, we have found that strains belonging to lisboa3-a miru-vntr cluster  share three distinct is <dig> insertion sites on rv <dig> , rv2818c  and rv <dig> . strains from the xdr-tb lisboa <dig> b <dig> clade  share a distinctive is <dig> site on the plcc gene . although no common is <dig> site was found for the scg  <dig> strains, scg  <dig> strains were found to share three is <dig> sites: an intergenic site on position 888786; on rv1754c ; and, on rv2820c . scg  <dig> strains were found to also share three is <dig> sites on mmps <dig> , ppe <dig>  and ppe <dig> . one hundred and fifty-three  sites were found to be specific to a single isolate.

interestingly, an is <dig> insertion in the ntf locus  was detected in six out of the eight beijing strains included in the analysis, which is a characteristic of the beijing/w family  <cit>  . hence, two of the three beijing isolates recovered in lisbon health region were found to belong to the beijing/w family. no relation with the new york city beijing/w mdr clade was found as a second insertion in the ntf locus was not detected in any strains  <cit> . curiously, a scg 6a strain  shared the latter insertion site with the beijing/w strains, although only one end was detected which can be indicative of another genomic rearrangement. a scg <dig> strain  was found to have an is <dig> 67 bp upstream of the characteristic is <dig> insertion site of the beijing/w family, however in a different orientation. both insertion sites are found within rv3128c. this latter gene has an in-frame amber nonsense mutation in h37rv and for this reason any functional consequence of is6110-mediated orf disruption is highly questionable.

strains belonging to pgg <dig> were found to have a significantly lower number of is <dig> copies when compared with pgg <dig> strains . given the reduced number of pgg <dig> strains no statistical comparison was possible to perform.

differential substitution ratios highlight different genomic adaptation strategies
a statistically significant difference in the ns/s ratio was observed between lisboa3/q <dig> and beijing strains and others, but only the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> result met a multiple comparison threshold . the only significant tv/ts ratio difference occurred for differences between lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clusters  .

these ratios were also found to vary across the genome and across the different clusters of orthologous gene groups . for each strain, we have computed the ns/s and tv/ts ratio for the different genomic quadrants and for each cog. overall quadrant ns/s and tv/ts comparison, showed that ns/s ratio varied along the chromosome such that the second quadrant had a lower ns/s ratio when compared with the other three quadrants and that the first quadrant had the highest ns/s mean ratio  . no statistical difference was observed between the third and fourth quadrant. regarding the tv/ts ratio, an approximately inverse situation was found as no statistical difference was observed between the first, third and fourth quadrants. the second quadrant showed however, a significantly higher tv/ts ratio than the three other quadrants  .

when these results were stratified by genetic clade, it was found that in the first quadrant the beijing strains showed a statistically lower ns/s ratio upon comparison with q <dig> and other non-clustered  strains, but not lisboa <dig> . no statistical difference was found in this quadrant for tv/ts ratio. in the second quadrant, lisboa <dig> strains showed a statistically significant reduced ns/s ratio compared with the other three groups of strains, while beijing strains presented a higher ns/s ratio than the remaining groups . inversely, the tv/ts ratio on the second quadrant was significantly higher for beijing strains when compared to q <dig> and other nc strains, but not to lisboa <dig> strains . the analysis of the third quadrant showed no statistical difference for ns/s ratio while beijing strains showed a higher tv/ts ratio on comparison with lisboa <dig> and other nc strains, but not q <dig> strains. lisboa <dig> strains showed a reduced tv/ts ratio on this latter quadrant when compared to all other groups. in the fourth quadrant, only a statistical difference was observed for a q <dig> reduced ns/s ratio when comparing with the other strain groups and no significant difference was observed for the tv/ts ratio .

these results show that the ns/s and tv/ts ratio measures appear to vary on a strain and chromosome region dependent mode. data stratification by isolate and quadrant showed that the tv/ts ratio was found to correlate negatively with the ns/s ratio . correlation between overall isolate ns/s and tv/ts ratio was also attempted but no correlation was found .

the comparison of the ns/s and tv/ts ratios across the different cogs also yielded strain dependent results. on comparison with the other three strain groups: lisboa <dig> strains showed higher ns/s ratios on cog groups d  and p ; q <dig> strains showed higher ns/s ratios on cog group v ; and, beijing strains showed higher ns/s ratios on cog groups f , k , n , o  and q  . regarding the tv/ts ratio no significant difference was observed for lisboa <dig> strains, but higher ratios were observed for q <dig> strains in cog groups j , l , m  and, for beijing strains in cog group c  .

these results support the notion of a differential mode of evolution and adaptation to the human host by accumulation/selection of a higher degree of non-synonymous mutations at genes belonging to specific functional categories.

according to recent work by namouchi et al.  <cit> , the ns/s ratio varied along the phylogenetic tree, such that terminal branches had a higher ns/s ratio than inner branches. we have computed the ns/s and tv/ts ratio for the inner nodes assigned in the subtrees in figure  <dig> and compared with the respective ratios calculated for the tips of the subtrees. contrary to the data of namouchi et al.  <cit>  we have verified that both subtrees had ≈ 6% and ≈ 12% lower ns/s ratios at the tips of lisboa <dig> and q <dig> subtrees, respectively, when compared with the inner nodes of the tree . for the tv/ts ratio, the opposite was found: higher tv/ts ratios were observed at the tips in comparison with the inner nodes .

discussion
m. tuberculosisgenomic distinctiveness in lisbon
for at least two decades the lisbon health region in portugal has been characterized by a high-level of drug resistance, at first mdr-tb, and later xdr-tb, mainly caused by a particular group of strains: the lisboa family. presently, this drug resistance is due almost in its entirety to an endemic circulation of the q <dig> and lisboa <dig> phylogenetic clades. present data from 24-loci  miru-vntr allowed the subdivision of the lisbon <dig> cluster in two other clusters herein designated as lisboa3-a and –b. this data suggests two independent outbreaks, over the years, dated back to the 90s when the discrimination of lisboa strains was identified by distinct rpob mutations  <cit> . the q <dig> spoligotyping data has revealed that this cluster is in fact intimately related with the b cluster identified in the 90s outbreak . phylogenetic analysis based on previously published sets of snps  <cit>  revealed that lisboa <dig> and q <dig> strains formed distinct monophyletic evolutionary clades within the scg  <dig> and pgg  <dig>  interestingly, m. tuberculosis f <dig> and the xdr-tb associated kzn strains, both originating from south africa, also belong to scg  <dig>  nevertheless a clear distinction is highlighted in the proposed phylogeny. this distinctiveness is also reflected by the rd comparison, but lisboa <dig>  q <dig> and kzn strains appear to have an incongruent phylogeographic association using the rd typing. all these strains belong to the euro-american lineage according to the rd classification proposed by gagneux et al.  <cit> . however, the kzn strains included in the analysis showed to be positive for rd <dig>  associated with an americas/europe sublineage, despite the fact that these strains are a major public health concern in south africa, namely, the xdr-tb outbreak in kwazulu natal  <cit> . the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> strains were on the other hand positive for rd <dig>  associated with a west-african sublineage, but constitute a major public health concern in europe. present knowledge recognizes that rd <dig> is also associated with rdrio, an lsp that has initially been discovered in rio de janeiro, brazil but was later found to be widespread. historic ties connect portugal, brazil and west african countries and a possible ancestor for these two clades might lie in africa, more specifically on portuguese speaking african countries. these phylogeographic incongruences are consistent with human migratory events out from, and back into, the african continent  <cit> . moreover, these results also highlight that more is still needed to fully grasp the genetic diversity present within the scg <dig> and lam family as it encloses a high genetic diversity allied with a broad geographical distribution  <cit> .

another question still seems pertinent as to which selective advantages do these two clades possess allowing such high prevalence in this setting especially since other strains, e.g. pre-xdr-tb beijing strains, also do circulate but at an apparent lesser prevalence? tb caused by rdrio strains has shown to be associated with weight loss, hemoptysis, higher bacillary loads and progression to cavitary disease  <cit> . this deletion encompasses several ppe genes that have shown to be a potential source of immune variation  and hence, may constitute a pathogenic adaptation strategy to immune evasion. higher bacillary loads are associated with a higher secondary case rate  and if in fact the absence of these genes truly plays an important role towards an increased virulence, or even transmissibility, it may be a factor that has contributed to the high prevalence of rdrio strains in this setting simultaneously contributing to the emergence and spread of m/xdr-tb strains.

besides previously described rds, the additional structural variants that were identified and that may be clade-specific could carry functional consequences that reflect host adaptation and selection. the finding that a 112 bp deletion is present among lisboa <dig> clade strains, with a more restricted distribution than rdrio, affecting gene ppe <dig> might also provide additional clues and contribute to a higher virulence or transmissibility. ppe <dig> has been previously described has having an immunodominant nature and shown to activate a cd4+ and cd8+ mediated t cell response leading to an enhanced ifn-γ response as well as induce a strong humoral response  <cit> . the deletion found might constitute a means of immune evasion and constitute a selective advantage over other circulating strains. more specifically, a stronger humoral response to ppe <dig> was found among extra-pulmonary tb patients  <cit> . the selective advantage provided by this deletion might therefore also be related with the fact that lisboa strains were first identified among hiv-infected patients, which is associated with an increase in extra-pulmonary tb.

phylogenetic context and microevolutionary trajectory of lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades
the use of snps as molecular markers has contributed to an improved understanding of the evolutionary history of the m. tuberculosis complex. in the present study, given the availability of genomewide snp data, a snp-based phylogeny was deduced from the genomic data and, overall, the proposed phylogeny appears to be consistent with other snp-based phylogenies although as already pointed out: scg  <dig> does not exist as a monophyletic lineage but instead as a paraphyletic one. the original report by filliol et al. <cit>  proposed a minimum number of sixteen snps that allowed assignment of any strain to an scg but not to its subgroupings. a later erratum showed that scg 3a belonged in fact to pgg <dig> while scg 3b and 3c belonged to pgg <dig> as confirmed by our results. alland et al.  <cit>  proposed instead a set of nine snps that allowed strain assignment to any scg and each subgroup  <cit> .

the phylogeny constructed in the present study contributes nevertheless to demonstrate the uniqueness of lisboa <dig> and q <dig> strains in a global context and will comprise a future framework for genome-wide association studies .

the phylogeny proposed also enabled a microevolutionary perspective on the path towards mdr and xdr. as expected, in the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades, inh resistance was found to be mediated by double inha promoter/structural mutations, recently described by some of us to contribute to inh high-level resistance  <cit> . the acquisition of inha c-15 t mutation was found to have occurred independently in both lineages, and in q <dig> cluster it was possible to determine that c-15 t mutation was acquired at a first stage of inh high-level resistance development. in lisboa <dig> it was not possible to determine which mutation appeared in the first place since no lisboa <dig> isolate with a single inha mutation was found. recent work by fenner et al.  <cit>  suggested that inha promoter mutations, more specifically c-15 t mutation, might be associated with lineage  <dig>   <cit> . nevertheless, another earlier study from brimacombe et al.  <cit>  showed that scg  <dig> and  <dig> had all the mutations of interest towards inh resistance  <cit> . in our view, the fact that inh resistance in both lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades is associated with inha mutations, instead of the of the more usual katg mutations, is possibly related with selective pressures exerted by the drug regimen itself.

the analysis of lisboa <dig> subtree has further highlighted the m/xdr evolutive process in this clade. we have recently proposed an evolutionary path regarding drug resistance acquisition dynamics based on the acquisition of an eis promoter mutation as the first-step from mdr to xdr  <cit> . however the snp phylogeny proposed is consistent with a twice and independent acquisition of an eis promoter mutation. given this phylogeny it is not possible to establish any order of mutation acquisition. nonetheless, instead of a single event, our analysis supports multiple development of xdr-tb in the same phylogenetic clade. two different transmission chains involving strains with the rpob s450l, instead of one, are also more likely since it is proposed that this mutation has also been acquired twice and independently  <cit> .

also important, he lisboa <dig> xdr lineage characterized by gyra d94g and eis g-10a mutations  will most likely present resistance to kan, but not to cap and amk. if drug susceptibility testing to kan is not included in the standard second-line drug panel of tested drugs, the strains belonging to this lineage will have an undetected xdr phenotype. an exception to this is the strain ff359_ <dig> that bears a rrs a1401g mutation that leads to high-level kan, amk and cap resistance  <cit> .

one striking phylogenetic incongruence was found in two q <dig> strains that lacked both second-line injectable drug and fq genetic resistance determinants and at the same time sharing a recent common ancestor resistant to these two classes of drugs. these two strains were genotypically and phenotypically susceptible to amikacin , capreomycin  and any of the fqs tested. two explanations may be considered: a phylogenetic misplacement, although the branches had a good statistical support or, these strains may descend from a reverter ancestor. although theoretically possible, events such as these may be extremely rare. only one report has documented an in-patient reversion of an isogenic strain from inh resistant to susceptible  <cit> .

compensatory evolution and rif-resistance
the acquisition of further mutations in rpoa, rpob or rpoc genes following rif resistance development was recently demonstrated, using salmonella as a model organism, to have an important role in fitness compensation, leading to a reduction in the doubling-time to values closer to the wild-type  <cit> .it as also been demonstrated that rpoc gene has been target of convergent evolution  <cit> . in our microevolutionary analysis we have detected a rpoc mutation  occurring in the same branch as a rpob s450l . it is the first description of a putative compensatory mutation within the lisboa <dig> clade, contributing to the success of one of its sub-lineages through the amelioration of the resistance fitness cost  <cit> . rif compensatory evolution has been the subject of two recent studies that showed a high prevalence of rpoa and rpoc mutations mapped to the rpoa-rpoc interaction region  <cit> . the rpoc mutation described in a lisboa <dig> sub-lineage does not fall in this region, nor was it described in these studies  <cit> . nevertheless, two other putative compensatory mutations mapping to the rpoa-rpoc interaction region were found in other isolates not belonging to the lisboa <dig> or q <dig> clades . the putative role of these two latter mutations is only substantiated by the bioinformatic analysis of residue conservation. however, the putative compensatory role of the lisboa <dig> k1152q rpoc is further substantiated by their co-occurrence in the same branch as the rif resistance determining mutation in rpob. furthermore, none of these putative compensatory mutations was previously described and may constitute novel polymorphisms associated with molecular rif resistance compensation  <cit> .

rpob mutational analysis also allowed the identification of five putative compensatory mutations, of which one  was found to be acquired in the q <dig> clade following rif resistance acquisition through another rpob mutation. this latter mutation was found to be homoplasic as it was also detected in different scgs, which also points towards the usefulness of this mutation to counteract fitness costs imposed by the acquisition of other rif resistance associated mutations. mutations outside the rif resistance determining region on rpob gene have been described previously on rif-resistant isolates with no mutations on this region  <cit> . the mutations herein described as putatively compensatory were only considered as such if a mutation in the rrdr was already present providing further support for the compensatory role of the former.

the role of compensatory mutations in other loci and associated with compensation to resistance to other drugs than rif have been identified and studied, namely, mutations on ahpc for inh or on rrs for second-line drug aminoglycosides . nevertheless, no compensatory mutations were identified in these genes .

still, it is yet possible that other mechanisms underlying resistance or compensation might lie elsewhere in the genome as even the role that synonymous snps play in gene expression must be reckoned with. such an example in m. tuberculosis comes from a recent and elegant study by safi et al. <cit>  in which a synonymous snp on rv <dig> was found to act as an hypermorphic mutation on a downstream gene , leading to an increase in emb resistance  <cit> . in the same study, another type of mutation was found to be a key player at the multistep process of emb resistance development – a neomorphic mutation on gene rv3806c that increased the turnover of the decaprenylphophoryl-β-d-arabinose pathway, which also led to an increase in emb resistance  <cit> . two other recent studies from zhang et al. <cit>  and farhat et al. <cit>  also point to other genes that may be at play and under positive selection concerning drug resistance in m. tuberculosis <cit> . it becomes clear that functional characterization of the significant portion of the m. tuberculosis genes of unknown function must catch up the pace of high-throughput sequencing if a broader understanding of the genomic adaptation process is to be obtained.

is6110transposition role in gene integrity and regulation
insertion site mapping revealed a high genomic stability of insertion sequences other than is <dig>  in fact, we have verified that only deletion events were responsible for variability regarding presence/absence of an insertion sequence other than is <dig>  on the other hand, as demonstrated in this study is <dig> is a highly polymorphic marker, probably due to its rapid transposition rate  <cit> .

the finding that  <dig> % of the is <dig> insertion sites mapped were located intragenically is in line with previous reports  <cit> . considering that ≈ 91% of m. tuberculosis genome is composed by coding regions  <cit> , it highlights the deleterious effects of transposition into certain genes essential to viability or to the successful completion of the pathogen’s infectious cycle. pgg <dig> strains, including the beijing strains, were found to bear a higher number of is <dig> copies than pgg <dig> strains. is <dig> copy number is presumed to be under negative selection  <cit> , however, in certain circumstances, it is the insertion site per se that might provide a selective advantage and not the copy number.

considering the data obtained in this study, is <dig> is unarguably the species’ most important mobile element when considering transposition impact on genomic integrity. is <dig> appears to have an important role in genomic re-shaping towards adaptation either through localized disruption of putative antigenic targets  or through its mobile promoter activity located in the is <dig> 3′ end, capable of inducing transcription or upregulating the expression of downstream genes under stressful conditions  <cit> . we have found a considerable number of insertion sites to be within ppe genes and a more reduced number of sites to be upstream of ppe genes. ppe genes appear to have been positively selected in pathogenic mycobacteria, have important immune and antigenic potential, and some can induce a shift towards a th2-type response  <cit> . not only the is6110-mediated disruption of ppe genes might constitute a mean of immune evasion but it is also conceivable that upregulation of specific ppe genes might affect the th1/th <dig> response balance.

remarkably, lisboa <dig> and q <dig> did not show any is6110-mediated disruption of a ppe orf, nor did we found any is <dig> upstream of a ppe gene. this fact perhaps demonstrates a different mode of evolution and host adaptation that does not require ppe gene modulation through is <dig> transposition.

nevertheless, the maximum distance between an is <dig> and a downstream gene so that this 3′ promoter can exert its influence on gene expression is unknown. the results reported by safi et al.  <cit>  demonstrate that an is <dig> in m. tuberculosis  <dig> located 297 bp upstream of rv1468c was associated with a threefold increase in transcription upon macrophage infection. our results show that 15% of the mapped sites are located upstream of an orf in proper orientation and at a distance of less than 300 bp which, at the light of present knowledge, fulfills the necessary assumptions to exert a putative upregulatory effect on those orfs. also considering the diversity of orfs interrupted by is <dig> copies, gene knock out studies and assessment of downstream gene expression are necessary if a functional role for specific transposition events is to be established.

spoligotyping lineage association with specific is <dig> sites has already been demonstrated, highlighting the phylogenetic informativeness of this marker  <cit> . our results also support an association of specific is <dig> sites with strain lineage at both global and local levels.

genome-wide snp dynamics
notably, the comparison of the distribution of snps by cog showed that ns/s ratios vary through cog in a lineage-dependent manner. although, lisboa <dig> and q <dig> isolates might be overrepresented in the analysis due to the high prevalence in the community, we have shown that lisboa <dig> and q <dig> present statistically different ns/s ratios from the remaining isolates. we propose that differences in ns/s cog might highlight different evolution strategies selected during host-pathogen interaction and adaptation.

moreover, an overall higher ns/s ratio was observed for the first quadrant and an overall lower ns/s ratio was observed for the second quadrant revealing heterogeneous ns/s ratios negatively correlated with the tv/ts ratio. the biochemical nature behind this tv/ts ratio heterogeneity requires further studies as it may be driving localized higher non-synonymous mutation rates with functional impact on strain evolution. the precise genes affected by non-synonymous mutations within these cog categories merit further studies as each cog includes a considerable number of genes, that mutated might enhance the transmissibility or drug resistance, and should be analyzed in a systems biology perspective using in silico models .

the finding that terminal branches of the subtrees analyzed had lower ns/s ratios than the inner branches was contrary to the findings of namouchi et al.  <cit> . namouchi et al. suggested that non-synonymous changes might be purged by natural selection yielding higher ns/s ratios. however, an opposite view is also possible: non-synonymous mutations are favored by natural selection yielding the same higher ns/s ratio, especially as a mean of adaptation in an organism devoid, or with low, horizontal gene transfer such as m. tuberculosis <cit> . from our data, we can say that non-synonymous mutations may be favored in the inner branches of both subtrees as a mean to develop and adapt to drug resistance, yielding a higher ns/s ratio that is consistent with a reduced purifying selection  <cit> . nevertheless, the differences between the results from both studies might lie in the fact that the ns/s ratio analysis herein presented was performed for two sets of strains that are in a much more closer time frame in order to understand microevolution within two clades.

wgs and molecular epidemiology
in the present study we have shown that in lisbon, portugal, where the mdr-tb situation had already escalated to a xdr-tb situation, it is mainly caused by transmission of two unique phylogenetic clades. we have previously shown that xdr-tb was already a reality in portugal during the 1990s  <cit>  but noteworthy, the data from the present study clearly shows that these strains belong to the same phylogenetic lisboa <dig> m/xdr sublineages that are still presently in circulation. the uniqueness of these strains was revealed by a distinct phylogenetic placement within scg  <dig> 

the lisboa <dig> clade belongs to a much broader group of strains that usually share at least 95% of miru-vntr pattern similarity: the lisboa family  <cit> . one of the future goals is to better understand the populational structure of this family of strains, from which the lisboa <dig> clade has differentiated, as strains belonging to this family have previously shown the potential to evolve to mdr-tb  <cit> .

another important point coming from the present student is the utility of wgs for epidemiological surveillance and strain typing. wgs presents an advantage over the classical typing methods  as it enables picturing transmission at a much higher resolution and ascertain isolate relatedness using well described models of molecular evolution. in the present study, wgs allowed strain discrimination within miru-vntr clusters and distinguish between three independent lisboa <dig> mdr sub-clades. despite the technical difficulties in data analysis, as wgs costs converge towards the cost of miru-vntr, the former is likely to replace miru-vntr as the gold-standard for molecular epidemiological surveillance and strain typing. wgs can also enable more focused contact tracing by reducing the number of plausible genomically linked cases to investigate, leading to an improved case detection. wgs-assisted routine surveillance is still far away for many settings, but as this technology becomes gradually available to the mycobacteriology laboratory it will also be expected a greater understanding of tb transmission. in a recent study, walker et al. have defined a threshold of  <dig> snps of difference, above which recent transmission can be excluded  <cit> . in our study, the number of unique snps to each isolate determined for the lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades are consistent with ongoing recent transmission. this finding allied with the genomic uniqueness of these strains are of special importance not only locally but in a macro-epidemiological context. it is likely that these strains may spread to other parts of the world, due to increasing global travel and migratory waves, and be the cause of additional public health concern . a recent report of an rdrio strain recovered from a remote location in tibet alerts to this possibility  <cit> .

it is also worth having in consideration that the host residing bacilli population has a certain degree of heterogeneity that can be overlooked through wgs but nonetheless lead to a higher than expected genomic difference after transmission. similarly, selection during drug treatment might also artificially extend genomic distances. in this regard, classical genotyping using more stable markers might prove useful. the present study also stresses the need of further genomic studies in order to contribute to a m. tuberculosis genome-wide evolutive scenario, representative of different settings.

this, together with clinical data, will ultimately enable gwas with a positive impact in tb management.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, it was found that the two main genetic clusters responsible for the great majority of mdr-tb in portugal form two monophyletic clades  that denote sequential resistance amplification and/or independent resistance acquisition. the data supports the notion of ongoing mdr-tb transmission and endemicity associated with lisboa <dig> and q <dig> clades. the results obtained also support notion of a higher genomic diversity than the one usually associated with m. tuberculosis, mostly acquired through genome downsizing and non-synonymous snps. different deletions were found to be specific to a number of lineages, of which some may carry functional consequences. specifically, the 112 bp deletion on ppe <dig> gene that, found among lisboa <dig> strains, may provide a selective advantage for these strains. different snp acquisition dynamics were also identified between the two clades which are suggestive of different adaptation strategies in which the transposition of is <dig> may also have an important role in modulating gene expression and integrity.
