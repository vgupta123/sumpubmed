BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa, a versatile gram-negative bacterium, is an opportunistic human pathogen that is worldwide the fourth most common cause of hospital-acquired infections of the gastrointestinal, urinary or respiratory tracts. these infections often result in fatal courses of disease. the emergence of p. aeruginosa as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens correlates with increasing resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants as well as the formation of highly resistant biofilms. p. aeruginosa has one of the most versatile metabolic arsenals of any described bacterium including its understudied polyamine metabolism  <cit> . polyamines are positively charged small organic molecules that are widely distributed and occur at high concentrations in the millimolar range in nearly all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells but also extracellularly e.g., in human serum or plasma. polyamines are known to play pivotal roles in many cellular processes including stabilization of dna, regulation of dna-protein interaction, posttranslational modification, cell cycle regulation, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . in prokaryotes polyamines are implicated in oxidative stress responses  <cit> , biofilm formation  and antibiotic resistance  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising that polyamines, their biosynthesis and transport systems are regarded as possible virulence factors of important human bacterial pathogens . particularly for p. aeruginosa, polyamines were shown to induce a complex yet not completely understood resistance mechanism against cationic peptide, aminoglycoside and quinolone antibiotics which was linked to the polyamine metabolism  <cit> . the role of polyamines in biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa is still unknown. but the metabolism of agmatine, a precursor of putrescine, was shown to be linked to the development of a biofilm which let the authors hypothesize that preferential induction of the agu2abca’ operon containing two genes for agmatine deiminases by agmatine in the stationary phase and during biofilm growth may have evolved to provide polyamines for biofilm development  <cit> . although polyamines are required for growth of p. aeruginosa, these compounds could be toxic in high excess. therefore, polyamine homeostasis must be maintained through a fine regulated network of polyamine biosynthesis, catabolismus, excretion and uptake. excess polyamine in many types of bacteria, including e. coli, bacillus subtilis and s. aureus, is acetylated, thereby converted into a physiologically inert form and subsequently excreted to maintain the polyamine level  <cit> . in contrast, p. aeruginosa possesses no homolog of the respective acetyltransferase in e. coli as revealed by sequence similarity search. chou et al. hypothesize that polyamine homeostasis in p. aeruginosa is kept mainly through two catabolic pathways  <cit> . the polyamine putrescine is converted into 4-aminobutyrate  either via the conserved transamination and dehydrogenation route or the γ-glutamylation route  <cit> . yao et al. postulate six γ-glutamylpolyamine synthetases to initiate polyamine catabolism and suggest them as a molecular target for new antibiotic strategies exploiting the alleviation of polyamine toxicity when in excess  <cit> . only few studies reported on polyamine transporters. one of them was identified by lu et al. and proposed to be an abc transporter system for spermidine uptake  <cit> . in addition, this polyamine transport system was linked to the type iii secretion system, which is a major virulence factor in bacteria  <cit> . the molecular recognition of polyamines by the transporter system was elucidated by wu et al. providing a rational approach to blocking type iii secretion through targeting of the polyamine uptake system  <cit> . a similarity search for homologous sequences of histone deacetylase enzymes revealed three genes for putative acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases  in the genome of p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  <cit> . like other bacterial apahs, e.g., from mycoplana ramosa, the corresponding protein sequences from p. aeruginosa belong to the histone deacetylase family, and the amino acids lining the active site and chelating the catalytic zinc ion are highly conserved. as pointed out above, no similar sequences to a polyamine acetyltransferase could be found in the p. aeruginosa genome. therefore, the specific role of the predicted apahs appears to be unclear. in the following, the putative apah enzymes are named after their gene designation, i.e., pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig>  the function of these enzymes has been only sparsely investigated before. pa <dig> was shown to be closely related to hdah and able to hydrolyze an artificial acetylated lysine substrate  <cit> . on the base of transcriptome data and the chemical similarity between n-carbamoyl- and n-acetylputrescine, pa <dig> and pa <dig> have been proposed to be involved in the conversion of agmatine into putrescine  <cit> . this statement was underlined by the induction of the genes of pa <dig> and pa <dig> by exogenous acetylputrescine and agmatine which was suggested to be mediated by n-carbamoyl-putrescine. however, only the deacetylation of acetylputrescine by pa <dig> was proven with a purified enzyme. given this fact, it remained an open question whether acetylputrescine or other acetylated polyamines may be the natural substrates of the three putative apahs from p. aeruginosa even though no obvious opponent polyamine acetyltransferases are identified yet. herein, we perform a combined biochemical and microbiological study to dissect the substrate specificity of the three putative apahs in p. aeruginosa and suggest probable roles of these enzymes in the living organism.

RESULTS
the putative apahs of p. aeruginosa are members of the histone deacetylase family
the role of polyamine metabolismus in the formation of pathogenic biofilms  inspired our search for novel enzymes, particularly deacetylases which potentially take part in the polyamine metabolism of p. aeruginosa. exploiting the pseudomonas genome database  <cit>  three putative apahs were found: pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig> which show remarkable sequence similarity to enzymes belonging to the histone deacetylase family. the amino acid sequences of these enzymes were subjected to a multiple sequence alignment including hdah from bordetella sp., apah from m. ramosa and human hdac <dig>  the bacterial enzymes hdah, apah from m. ramosa and human hdac <dig> were selected due to their high similarity to pa <dig> and pa <dig> or pa <dig>  respectively. in addition, the 3d-structures of hdah  <cit>  and apah from m. ramosa  <cit>  are available and allowed a mapping of the amino acids of the enzymes from p. aeruginosa to their function and position with respect to the active site. the essential amino acids discussed in the following are numbered according to the x-ray structure of hdah . d <dig>  d <dig> and h <dig> are responsible for chelating the catalytic zn2+-ion and are identical for all aligned proteins . likewise, the amino acids involved in the catalytic mechanism , are the same in all sequences  <cit> . in addition, the channel to the catalytic center is lined with highly homologous amino acids . based on their sequence, pa <dig> and pa <dig> form a cluster with the verified functional acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase apah from m. ramosa, whereas pa <dig>  hdah and hdac <dig> are grouped in a different cluster . hdac <dig> was chosen because it is the closest human homolog to pa <dig>  in fact, pa <dig> and pa <dig> are the enzymes with highest percent identity  and still high identity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % to the apah from m. ramosa . the closest homolog of pa <dig> is hdah whose natural substrate is still unknown. hdah has been shown to deacetylate proteins, e.g., histones, although it is a bacterial enzyme. both, pa <dig> and hdah, show a moderate percent identity of  <dig>  % to the second domain of human hdac <dig>  a proven deacetylase of several cytosolic proteins . the sequence based distinct clustering of the three deacetylases from p. aeruginosa with apah from m. ramosa or hdah and hdac <dig> suggested a true acetylpolyamine amidohydrolase functionality of pa <dig> and pa <dig>  in contrast, the role of pa <dig> appeared to be different. the similarity to protein deacetylases gave rise to the assumption that yet unknown proteins rather than polyamines would be substrates of pa <dig> fig.  <dig>

in-vitro substrate-specificity of the putative apahs from p. aeruginosa
the putative apahs from p. aeruginosa, pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig>  have already been expressed in e. coli previously  <cit> , however, a detailed characterization with respect to function and substrate specificity is still missing. pa <dig> was shown to deacetylate acetylputrescine in a transcriptome analysis of agmatine and putrescine catabolism  <cit> , and the functionality of pa <dig> as closest homolog of hdah from bordetella sp. was only investigated with fluorogenic lysine substrates that were either trifluoroacetylated, acetylated or propylated at the ε-amino group of lysine with decreasing maximal enzyme velocities  <cit> . in contrast, pa <dig> was functionally characterized for the first time in this study. the substrate specificity of all above mentioned putative apahs from p. aeruginosa was analyzed using a panel of four acetylated polyamines and two lysine-based fluorogenic substrates. two orthogonal assay systems were applied to measure the deacetylation of acetylpolyamines. the diamine oxidase assay was only applicable to the shorter acetylcadaverine and acetylputrecine but not to n1-acetylspermine or n1-acetylspermidine, because the latter substrates already generate an assay signal without being deacetylated by one of the apahs. for comparison and to investigate the hydrolysis of n1-acetylspermine and n1-acetylspermidine, which could otherwise not be examined, a more general optimized acetate release assay was exploited  <cit> . the diamine oxidase assay proved that both, acetylcadaverine and acetylputrescein are deacetylated by pa <dig> and pa <dig> but not by pa <dig> . both, pa <dig> and pa <dig>  exhibit km-values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm which is about one order of magnitude lower than the typical intracellular bacterial polyamine concentrations  <cit> . pa <dig> appears to be the more active enzyme and reaches about the three-fold maximum velocity of pa <dig> for the hydrolysis of the small acetylpolyamines in the quantitative diamine oxidase assay. the acetate release assay confirmed that pa <dig> and pa <dig> could hydrolyze acetylcadaverine and acetylputreseine, whereas pa <dig> could not . in addition, it could be shown that n1-acetylspermine and n1-acetylspermidine were both substrates of pa <dig>  whereas pa <dig> showed only very low catalytical activity to deacetylate n1-acetylspermine. taken together, pa <dig> and pa <dig> are efficient apahs with different selectivity for acetylated polyamines with pa <dig> being the more active and less selective enzyme. moreover, the high sequence homology of both enzymes from p. aeruginosa and the apah from m. ramosa  is reflected by a comparable broad acetylpolyamine substrate tolerance  <cit> table  <dig> enzyme activity parameters using different substrates

it was also instructive to examine the enzyme activity of the deacetylases from p. aeruginosa using fluorogenic lysine substrates usually used to assay human histone deacetylases. the chemically activated boc-k--amc substrate was processed by all enzymes with different vmax values. more distinct differences occurred using the plain boc-k--amc substrate: pa <dig> showed the lowest and pa <dig> the highest activity under standard assay conditions . therefore, sequence homology and in vitro substrate specificity point in the same direction and suggest that pa <dig> and pa <dig> are predominantly true acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases whereas pa <dig> is clearly not. the pronounced capability of pa <dig> to process both lysine-based substrates lets us hypothesize that its principal task is the deacetylation of yet unknown protein substrates.

growth analyses and biofilm formation
to unravel the physiological function of the three deacetylases pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig> in vivo, the two wildtype strains, pa <dig> and pa <dig> as well as the three pa <dig> transposon mutant strains Ωpa <dig>  Ωpa <dig>  and Ωpa <dig>  each with a disrupted gene for one single deacetylase, were investigated by analyzing their growth kinetics in culture media supplemented with acetylcadaverine or acetylputrescine, respectively. in the presence of glucose together with either acetylcadaverine or acetylputrescine, the inhibitors saha and satfmk have no influence on the growth curves of pa <dig> and pa <dig> wildtype strains  indicating, that none of the deacetylases possesses a vital function in the presence of an ample alternative carbon source. however, using acetylcadaverine or acetylputrescin polyamines as the only carbon source, a significant growth reduction was detected for pa <dig> and to a lesser extent for pa <dig> cultures in the presence of saha and satfmk acetylase inhibitors, respectively, with a stronger effect for satfmk . in the presence of acetylcadaverine, the Ωpa <dig> mutant was unable to use this polyamine as a substrate within the analyzed period of time  or had an extreme growth retardation. the Ωpa0321mutant showed also a markedly delayed growth with a slight hint of increase after 15 h . in contrast, the Ωpa <dig> mutant regained the capability to utilize acetylcadaverine similar to the pa <dig> wildtype . this suggests, that nor pa <dig> neither pa <dig> on its own can efficiently metabolize acetylcadaverine, only if both enzymes are intact , acetylcadaverine can be utilized as a substrate. the effects become clearer with another polyamine substrate. using acetylputrescine as sole carbon source for growth of Ωpa <dig> and Ωpa <dig>  we detected an elongated lag-phase of approximately 6 h before both mutant strains grew . for the Ωpa <dig> mutant no significant influence of saha and satfmk could be detected. in contrast, growth of the Ωpa <dig> mutant in the presence of acetylputrescine could be completely inhibited by satfmk and significantly by saha. growth of the Ωpa <dig> mutant in the presence of both acetylcadaverine and acetylputrescine was comparable to growth of the pa <dig> wildtype . this finding is in line with the biochemical results showing that only pa <dig> and pa <dig> but not pa <dig> can convert acetylated cadaverine and putrescine into the corresponding unmodified polyamines which can be further metabolized by the bacterium. the extent to which the growth of the mutants is inhibited also correlates with the biochemical in vitro potency of the applied inhibitors. the growth of the Ωpa <dig> mutant containing intact pa <dig> in the presence of acetylputrescine can be completely inhibited by satfmk which is more than 40-times potent against pa <dig> compared with pa <dig>  <cit>  . on the other hand, growth of the pa <dig> mutant in medium supplemented with acetylputrescine could only be inhibited slightly, probably due to the lower potency of satfmk against pa <dig>  <cit> . this may also explain to some extent, why growth of the pa <dig> and pa <dig> wildtypes and mutant strains of p. aeruginosa with functional pa <dig> cannot be completely inhibited by saha or satfmk. altogether, the growth curve experiments agree well with the biochemical in vitro results and provide evidence that pa <dig> and pa <dig> but not pa <dig> play an important role to the acetylated polyamines metabolism in p. aeruginosa.fig.  <dig> growth curves of p. aeruginosa wildtypes  and mutants with defective pa <dig> , pa <dig>  or pa <dig>  gene, respectively. all growth curves were performed in the absence of glucose and in the presence of  <dig> mm acetylcadaverine  or  <dig> mm acetylputrescine . all test conditions were applied in the absence , in the presence of  <dig> μm saha  or in the presence of  <dig> μm satfmk . the data points represent three biological replicates with indicated standard error



in addition to planktonic growth, microorganisms usually grow as surface-attached biofilms, which provide the bacteria protection against antibiotics or the host immune system  <cit>  and play therefore a crucial role in many chronic infections  <cit> . this encouraged us to analyze the impact of the deacetylase inhibitors saha and satfmk and the deacetylase gene knock-outs on biofilms of p. aeruginosa. using acetylcadaverine or acetylputrescine as sole carbon source in combination with the deacetylase inhibitors saha or satfmk, respectively, we detected a stimulating effect of both inhibitors on biofilm formation of the pa <dig> and pa <dig> wildtype, with the strongest effect in the presence of satfmk . in order to assess wether the disruption of a single deacetylase also impacts on biofilms of p. aeruginosa, we analyzed biofilm formation of the mutant strains Ωpa <dig>  Ωpa <dig>  and Ωpa <dig> in the presence of  <dig>  %  casamino acids which induces biofilm formation in p. aeruginosa. in comparison to the wildtype pa <dig>  the mutant strains Ωpa <dig> and Ωpa <dig> exhibited only marginal changes in biofilm biomass. in contrast, the Ωpa <dig> mutant showed a more significant attenuation in biofilm formation with a 25 % increase in biofilm biomass after  <dig> h of incubation compared to wildtype cells . due to the fact that biofilm formation is a rather complex processes influenced by a large number of different proteins and factors  <cit> , the exact mechanism of how knock-out of pa <dig> as well as the addition of saha and satfmk impacts on biofilm formation in p. aeruginosa is unknown and will be investigated in more detail in the future. however, since a large number of studies have shown, that environmental stressors e.g., ethanol  <cit>  or the antibiotics tetracycline, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem or gentamicin  can induce biofilm formation in p. aeruginosa, the stimulating effects of saha and satfmk on biofilm formation could reflect such a response to cellular stress for p. aeruginosa.fig.  <dig> relative biomass od595nm of pseudomonas pa <dig> and pa <dig> strains in bm <dig> media with 10mm acetylcadaverin or acetylputrescin polyamines as sole carbon source, challenged with  <dig> μm deacetylase inhibitors saha or satfmk. a pa <dig> strain with acetyl-cadaverine as carbon source  pa <dig> strain with acetylputrescine as carbon source  pa <dig> strain with acetylcadaverine as carbon source  pa <dig> strain with acetylputrescine as carbon source. e biofilm induction of pa <dig> mutant strains in the presence of  <dig>  %  casamino acids and in the absence of hdac inhibitors. biomass was quantified after 24h incubation in a static biofilm assay 



CONCLUSIONS
biochemical and growth experiments demonstrate that pa <dig> and pa <dig> are functional acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases and are able to make acetylated polyamines accessible for the metabolism of p. aeruginosa under lack of other carbon sources. in contrast, the postulated apah pa <dig> does not hydrolyze acetylpolyamines and shows no detectable influence on the growth of p. aeruginosa. the function of pa <dig> remains elusive, but, based on sequence homology, the enzyme is a member of the histone deacetylase superfamily and effectively hydrolyzes acetylated and trifluoroacetylated lysine substrates suggesting a possible role as lysine deacetylase of hitherto unknown protein substrates. saha and satfmk inhibit all three deacetylases from p. aeruginosa, and show a stimulating impact on biofilm formation by an unknown mechanism.
