BACKGROUND
wheat improvement is characterized by the need to control a high-dimensional trait space comprising grain yield and its components, quality traits, as well as abiotic and biotic stress resistances  <cit> . as a consequence of the large number of relevant traits, multi-stage selection is commonly applied in wheat breeding programs. multi-stage selection encompasses classical phenotypic selection as well as marker-assisted  <cit>  and genomic selection  <cit> .

in marker-assisted selection, a small number of predefined functional markers is used to predict the performance of genotyped material for a trait  <cit> . this strategy is worthwhile if major quantitative trait loci  are present that contribute to a large proportion of the genotypic variance for traits which are difficult and expensive to phenotype  <cit> . in contrast, in genomic selection, a large number of markers is used to predict the performance for complex traits controlled by many qtl with small effects  <cit> . for traits with presence of a few large and several small effect qtl, alternative biometrical approaches have been proposed to maximally profit from a combined marker-assisted and genomic selection  <cit> .

fusarium head blight  caused by fusarium graminearum, f. culmorum and other fusarium species severely impacts wheat production worldwide  <cit> . septoria tritici blotch  disease caused by mycosphaerella graminicola  has become one of the most devastating leaf diseases in central european winter wheat  <cit> . accurate knowledge of the genetic architecture of fhb and stb resistance is needed for a custom-tailored design of genomics-based breeding strategies. in this context, it is important to take into account that prediction accuracy of genomic selection is not only driven by the linkage disequilibrium between molecular markers and qtl, but also exploits genetic relatedness between members of the training and the test population  <cit> . especially in studies based on small training population sizes, effects of relatedness may become of overwhelming importance  <cit> . consequently, genomic selection models are not necessarily stable across different cycles of selection.

the relative relevance of linkage disequilibrium in comparison to relatedness for genomic selection is trait specific. it is challenging to differentiate both sources contributing to the accuracy of genomic selection as their effects are intermingled  <cit> . using mapping populations derived from factorial crosses offers a unique opportunity to untie linkage disequilibrium from relatedness as test populations with defined gradual degrees of relatedness to the training population can be established  <cit> .

the genetic architecture of stb resistance has been recently analyzed based on a mapping population of approximately  <dig> european wheat hybrids that were phenotyped in two environments  <cit> . the related cross-validation study suggested that the genetic architecture underlying stb resistance in this population is complex with absence of large effect qtl, which is in accordance to previous findings . the failure to detect large effect race-specific resistance genes such as stb <dig> originating from a bulgarian landrace  <cit>  in this collection can be explained by the fact that the related favorable alleles have not yet been introgressed into european elite wheat lines  <cit> . the potential of genomic selection in the above mentioned hybrid population was previously found to substantially depend on genetic relatedness  <cit> . the accuracy to predict stb resistance amounted only to  <dig>  when using a test set mostly unrelated to the training set. this accuracy is surprisingly low and comparable to that observed for grain yield in a similar experimental make-up  <cit> . verification of this result is relevant in order to assess the stability of genomic selection models for stb resistance.

major qtl for fhb resistance have been identified in populations derived from crosses with exotic donor lines. examples comprise qtl fhb <dig> from line sumai  <dig> or qtl fhb <dig> from line cm <dig>  <cit> . despite worldwide efforts, however, the favorable alleles of these qtl have so far not been used in wheat breeding in central europe  <cit> . as alternative strategy, identification of alternative qtl in adapted european wheat germplasm has been approached based on biparental qtl mapping  <cit>  and association mapping . the lack of congruency of qtl results across studies  <cit> , however, points to the presence of multiple qtl exhibiting small effects. first experimental results on the potential of genomic selection suggested that precise calibration can be achieved to improve fhb resistance in wheat breeding  <cit> . nevertheless, it is not clear whether the obtained calibration models mainly exploited relatedness between training and test sets and to what extent functional qtl information contributed to the prediction model.

based on phenotypic data obtained from multi-environment field trials and genotypic data generated using a wheat 90 k snp array for a large collection of 1604 f <dig> elite winter wheat hybrids and their  <dig> parental inbred lines, we contrasted the genetic architecture of fhb and stb disease severities applying association mapping and genomic selection in combination with a cross-validation approach. the objectives of our study were to  examine the correlations among fhb and stb disease severities,  investigate the genetic architecture of both traits, and  assess the potential of marker-assisted and genomic selection for improving fhb and stb disease resistance.

RESULTS
extensive field evaluation resulted in high heritabilities of fhb and stb disease severities
in the three environments harzhof  <dig>  harzhof  <dig> and rosenthal  <dig> fhb and stb disease severities were scored on the same plots, but we observed no significant correlations between fhb and stb disease severity values for all three environments  and consequently: this finding is in accordance to a previous study in wheat investigating the potential to simultaneously test for fhb and stb resistance in the same plot  <cit> , it is unlikely that the combined evaluation of both diseases impaired the quality of phenotypic data, thus representing an efficient phenotyping strategy.

fhb and stb disease pressures were high in all environments as reflected by the wide range of phenotypic values and genotypic variances significantly  larger than zero observed for all environments . the pearson moment correlations among phenotypic values of the  <dig> hybrids and their  <dig> parental lines estimated for single environments were on average moderate . these levels of pearson moment correlation are characteristic for diseases where susceptibility is controlled by multiple gene loci. consequently, multi-location field trials are needed to precisely estimate the genotypic value for fhb and stb disease severity.

in the analyses across environments, we observed a wide range of fhb and stb disease severity values approximating a normal distribution . this suggests the absence of large effect qtl, which, if present, should be reflected by discrete phenotype classes. the genetic variances of fhb and stb disease severities were significantly  larger than zero. heritability estimates for lines and hybrids were high and similar for both traits . this clearly underlined the excellent quality of the phenotypic data, that thus should be suitable to investigate the genetic architectures of both traits via association mapping and genomic selection.fig.  <dig> distribution of fhb and stb disease severities. a fusarium head blight  and b septoria tritici blotch  at a rating scale from  <dig> to  <dig>  as well as the estimates of broad-sense c heritability for the population of  <dig> wheat genotypes  evaluated in up to seven environments. μ indicates average of diseases severities. heritabilities where calculated in broad sense

simulation study suggests a high power to detect major qtl
the potential power of our experimental setting to detect qtl was explored using simulations using detection frequency as a measure . for small or intermediate effect qtl explaining 1 % or 5 % of the genotypic variance, detection power was predicted to be low to moderate. in contrast, for qtl explaining 10 % of the genotypic variance, detection power is predicted high provided the presence of snps in tight linkage disequilibrium to the qtl with r <dig> values above  <dig> . the average genetic map distance among adjacent snp pairs amounted to  <dig>  cm in our study, with average r <dig> values of  <dig>  . consequently, qtl detection power in our study was limited by the available marker density and might have been enhanced by increasing the genotyping depths of the  <dig> parental lines.fig.  <dig> simulations study of qtl detection power. detection frequency of a simulated qtl explaining 1 % , 5 % , or 10 %  of the genotypic variance, assuming markers in linkage disequilibrium  with the simulated qtl within r <dig> value classes  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> , and  <dig> – <dig> 



marker-assisted selection did not facilitate precise prediction of fhb and stb disease severities in unrelated genotypes
cross-validated accuracies of prediction for fhb and stb disease severities obtained by association mapping largely differed depending on the relatedness of members of training and test sets and the significance thresholds applied . for the t <dig> scenario with the test set highly related to the training set, we observed more than fourfold larger accuracies of prediction in comparison to the t <dig> scenario involving an unrelated test set for both traits. the cross-validated accuracies of prediction were for both traits close to zero with a stringent significance threshold for the t <dig> test population level and increased only slightly with relaxed significance thresholds.fig.  <dig> cross-validated accuracies of prediction for marker-assisted selection of a fusarium head blight and b septoria tritici blotch disease severity. markers included were selected based on different levels of significance  of associations. t <dig> test sets included hybrids sharing both parental lines, t <dig> test sets hybrids sharing one parental line and t <dig> test sets hybrids having no parental line in common with the hybrids in the related training sets. numbers in brackets indicate the average number of significant marker–trait associations based on  <dig> cross-validation runs



genomic selection allowed more accurate prediction of fhb and stb disease severities than marker-assisted selection
cross-validated accuracies of prediction of disease severity among unrelated hybrids  were low to moderate and amounted to  <dig>  for fhb and for  <dig>  stb . among related hybrids t <dig> scenario, accuracies of prediction accuracy increased  <dig>  - and  <dig>  - fold, respectively for fhb and stb disease severity. both genomic selection models applied, bayescπ and rr-blup, resulted in very similar prediction accuracies. a combined prediction approach considering additive and dominance effects was only slightly superior in predicting fhb and stb disease severities than the approach based on additive effects only .fig.  <dig> cross-validated accuracies of prediction for genomic selection of a fusarium head blight and b septoria tritici blotch disease severity in wheat. the results are based on the two genomic selection models bayescπ and ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction . t <dig> test sets included hybrids sharing both parental lines, t <dig> test sets hybrids sharing one parental line and t <dig> test sets hybrids having no parental line in common with the hybrids in the related training sets



discussion
independent genetic architectures of fhb and stb disease severities
miedaner et al.  <cit>  suggested that in european elite wheat lines fhb and stb disease severities are only marginally influenced by pleiotrophic and linkage effects, resulting in low genotypic correlations. our results confirm this view, as no significant correlation  between both disease severities was detected . in consequence, multivariate approaches modeling the covariance among traits as suggested for instance by  <cit>  cannot be expected to improve neither phenotypic analysis, nor association mapping or genomic selection approaches. therefore, we focused on univariate analyses of the genetic architecture of fhb and stb disease severities.

genetic architecture of fhb is less complex than for stb disease severity in central european elite wheat
cross-validated association mapping results are known to be influenced by relatedness between training and test populations as well as by functional qtl information  <cit> . the use of a hybrid population produced based on factorial mating designs enables the disentaglement of the two factors by inspecting the accuracy of prediction in a t <dig> test set largely unrelated to the estimation set in comparison to more related t <dig> and most related t <dig> test sets  <cit> . in our study, we failed to detect major qtl for both traits, which was reflected by a low accuracy of prediction of marker-assisted selection even in the t <dig> scenario . this clearly suggests that even though several major qtl controlling fhb and stb disease severities have been identified in exotic genotypes  <cit> , none of them is currently exploited in the sampled european elite varieties. the absence of large effect qtl from exotic donors in the central european wheat lines is most likely due to substantial yield penalties  <cit> .

the similar accuracy of prediction of genomic selection of fhb versus stb disease severity for the t <dig> scenario , in which relatedness between training and test sets is mainly exploited  <cit> , is not surprising as the underlying phenotypic data were of similar precision . in contrast, the accuracy of prediction of genomic selection was nearly  <dig> times larger for fhb than stb disease severity for the t <dig> test set most unrelated to the training set . the observed difference can be explained mainly by a better exploitation of functional qtl information for fhb than for stb disease severity. thus, our findings suggest that the genetic architecture is less complex in the case of fhb and, hence, given the same level of relatedness between training and test sets, can be more properly tackled to predict fhb than stb disease severity.

bayescπ does not improve the accuracy of prediction for fhb disease severity, a trait with medium genetic complexity
from the two genomic selection approaches tested, rr-blup approximates the infinitesimal model using the same shrinkage factor for all markers  <cit> . in contrast, bayescπ performs variable selection and assumes that a fraction 1-π of markers is not contributing to the genetic variance  <cit> . considering the lower complexity of the genetic architecture of fhb than stb disease severity reflected by three times higher prediction accuracies in the unrelated t <dig> test sets , it could be expected that bayescπ would outperform rr-blup. this was, however, not the case in our study. a possible explanation would be that several snps in linkage disequilibrium to relevant qtl were counterbalancing the drawbacks of rr-blup  <cit> . moreover, the precision of estimating the hyper parameters π tends to be overestimated  <cit> , which could reduce the advantages of bayescπ in comparison to rr-blup in modelling the genetic architecture of fhb disease severity more properly.

CONCLUSIONS
the diseases fhb and stb severely impair wheat production worldwide. both traits require intensive field trials to precisely estimate genotypic values, making them interesting targets for genomics-assisted breeding. our results suggest that the genetic architectures of both traits are complex, which favors genomic versus marker-assisted selection.

contrasting the cross-validated accuracies of prediction observed for tests sets with different degree of relatedness to the training sets clearly underlines that the precision to predict stb disease severity is mainly driven by relatedness. in contrast, genomic selection models are still moderately accurate predicting fhb disease severity in largely unrelated populations. consequently, functional qtl variation is exploited, which makes fhb disease severity an interesting model trait to fine-tune genomic selection models tackling besides relatedness also knowledge of the genetic architecture. one promising option to improve the prediction accuracy for fhb disease severity for instance, consists in expanding the bayesian alphabet by specifying distinct prior distributions for small and large marker effects.
