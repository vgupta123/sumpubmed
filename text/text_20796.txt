BACKGROUND
streptococcus and actinomyces species , e.g. a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus , constitute a large portion of the commensal microflora on oral surfaces  <cit> . while a. odontolyticus dominates at tongue surfaces, a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> colonize plaque and buccal surfaces but with different patterns  <cit> . moreover, actimomyces species have been implicated in dental caries, periodontitis and other infections  <cit> .

besides adhesion to salivary pellicles and oral epithelial surfaces  <cit> , actinomycetes and streptococci participate in inter- and intra generic coaggregations, as defined by the actinomyces-streptococcus coaggregation groups a to f for a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> , genospecies  <dig>  and a. odontolyticus  <cit> . to participate in these adhesive interactions, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> express two antigenically different fimbriae, type- <dig> and type- <dig>  <cit> . type- <dig> fimbriae bind to acidic proline-rich proteins and statherin in salivary pellicles on teeth  <cit> . type- <dig> fimbriae contribute to adhesion and colonisation  <cit>  by binding to galβ structures   <cit>  in salivary pellicles  <cit> , streptococci  <cit> , oral epithelial cells  <cit>  and to polymorphonuclear leucocytes  <cit> . both genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> express type- <dig> fimbriae but with variant galβ binding specificities  <cit> , and each genospecies exhibits at least two types of galβ-based hemagglutination patterns  <cit> .

the major subunit genes of type- <dig> and type- <dig> fimbriae, fima and fimp, respectively, have been cloned and sequenced from a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the deduced fima and fimp subunit proteins are  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid proteins, respectively, with  <dig> % amino acid identity. fima and fimp contain seven conserved proline-containing regions involved in folding of the two proteins and an lpxtg sorting signal followed by a n-terminal membrane spanning domain  <cit> . structurally diverse fima and fimp genes, as well as species-specific fima gene segments, have been found for a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig>  and linked to different coaggregation groups and types of galβ- and prp- related adhesion properties  <cit> . however, the fima gene has so far only been sequenced from a single strain of both genospecies  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> .

a. odontolyticus is a prominent member on the tongue as well as present at supra- and subgingival sites  <cit> . the fimbrial structure of a. odontolyticus, and host receptors, employed for its adhesion have not been fully investigated. however, inhibition studies show that sialylated carbohydrate structures, such as sialyl tn and 3' sialyllactose structures, serve as a salivary glycoprotein gp- <dig> receptor for a. odontolyticus strain pk <dig>  <cit> , which is a reference strain for coaggregation group e. moreover, hybridization studies  <cit>  have indicated fima- or fimp-related adhesins on a. odontolyticus, but fima or fimp genes have not yet been identified or sequenced from a. odontolyticus.

the aim of this study was to characterize fima genes from several strains of a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> with variant galβ binding specificities and from a strain of a. odontolyticus pk <dig> with a sialic acid binding specificity.

RESULTS
a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus pk <dig> display deviating cell binding properties
a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> express type- <dig> fimbriae with variant types of galβ binding specificity and a. odontolyticus express a sialic acid binding specificity potentially related to type- <dig> fimbriae . accordingly, while a. odontolyticus pk <dig> agglutinated untreated but not sialic acid-depleted red blood cells, a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig>  agglutinated only sialic acid depleted cells strongly, due to exposure of penultimate galβ-residues .

subtypes of fima proteins in a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus with different binding specificity
fima genes were amplified by pcr and sequenced from strains representative for genospecies  <dig> , genospecies  <dig>  and for a. odontolyticus  with different galβ and sialic acid binding properties, respectively. in addition, the a. naeslundii strains were selected to include two types of galβ-dependent hemagglutination patterns for each genospecies.

structurally variant fima proteins were found in a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus, respectively . the fima sequence identity between the three species was in the  <dig> – <dig> % range, while the sequence identity between strains of the same species was  <dig> – <dig>  %. accordingly, sequence analyses of the fima proteins, clustered fima proteins from genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus into separate groups, but the two latter species more closely . in addition, the spah fimbriae protein from corynebacterium diphteriae clustered more closely to fima than did fimp from a. naeslundii.

structural features of the novel fima protein in a. odontolyticus with a sialic acid specificity
the fima gene of a.odontolyticus pk <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein . the fima protein contains: i) an n-terminal signal peptide with a signal peptidase cleavage site, ii) a pilin motif for polymerisation of subunit monomers, iii) a proline-rich segment, iv) an e box motif, v) an lpxtg sorting motif, and vi) a c-terminal cell membrane spanning domain.

cleavage of the  <dig> amino acid fima protein of a.odontolyticus between residues  <dig> and  <dig> would generate a fimbrial subunit protein of  <dig> residues. this gives a theoretical subunit molecular weight of  <dig>  kda.

species-specific and conserved segments in fima proteins from a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus
the fima proteins from strains of a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig>  and  <dig>  and a. odontolyticus  were compared for fima sequences or segments conserved between the species or unique to each species . the generally high sequence identity  within a genospecies  revealed species specific sequences or segments that coincided with binding specificity.

among sequences conserved between fima proteins are the n-terminal signal peptide, pilin motif , proline-rich segment , e box  and lpxtg sorting motif , two additional proline-containing segments, as well as four other segments with high sequence identity . the pilin, e-box and lpxtg motifs displayed  <dig> to 100% sequence identity for fima proteins present in a.odontolyticus and a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> . multiple fima segments showed a low sequence identity between the species.

apart from the sequences unique to and conserved within each species, we could not identify or link any distinct motif, sequence or substitution to the different binding or hem-agglutination types between species or strains. however, the genospecies  <dig> strain p-5-n and genospecies  <dig> strain ly <dig> with somewhat lower intra-species sequence identities,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, showed unique hemagglutination or coaggregation patterns, respectively .

structural comparison of fima and fimp proteins from a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus and a. viscosus
the fimp  and fima protein families contained conserved n-terminal signal peptides and c-terminal membrane spanning segments, but with low sequence identity to each other  . high identity sequences in both fima and fimp are the proline-containing domains  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . in contrast, the proline-containing regions  <dig> and  <dig> are conserved domains in fimp but show only conserved proline residues in fima.

fima from a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus display different antigenic properties
strains of a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus were tested for reactivity with antisera r70- <dig> specific to fima from type- <dig> fimbriae of genospecies  <dig> strain  <dig> using whole cell agglutination and western blot analyses with whole cell proteins . while all strains of a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig>  except for strain pn-6-n, were agglutinated by the antisera, neither strains of genospecies  <dig> nor a. odontolyticus pk <dig> were agglutinated . thus, the native fima protein variants possess different antigenic properties and potentially different overall folding patterns.

moreover, only genospecies  <dig> strains possessed positive fima protein bands in western blot analyses with type  <dig> fimbriae specific antisera. besides the fima monomer  and polymers  detected in all genospecies  <dig> strains, di- to oligomers of fima  were also detactable, suggesting either oligomerization of fima subunits or the presence of polymeric fragments of covalently tathered fima subunits.

oligomerization of recombinant fima protein
to further explore the possible oligomerization of fima in solution, we expressed and purified the fima protein from a. naeslundii strain  <dig> as a recombinant protein and analysed its ability to oligomerize by gel electrophoresis and western blot analyses using fima specific antisera . gels of the recombinant fima protein revealed monomers  and oligomers  of fima, as confirmed by western blotting, verifying the possibility of fima di- to oligomerization in solution but dependence on whole cells for fimbriae polymerization.

discussion
the present study shows three unique subgroups of fima proteins present in a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus with different glycoconjugate receptors. it therefore supports our hypothesis that commensal micro organisms, like the genus actinomyces, exhibit complex and divergent mosaics of adhesin molecules related to species or subpopulations with different tropism and ecological niches. notably, a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus are members of coaggregation groups a/f, b/c/d and e, respectively, and differ in a variety of type- <dig>  type- <dig> and other adhesive properties  <cit> . the fima protein, which contains both sequences unique to and conserved between the species, may have evolved to match specific niches in supra- or subgingival plaque or in buccal or tongue epithelial tissues. the novel fima protein from a. odontolyticus strain pk <dig>  a reference strain for actinomyces-streptococcus coaggregations typical of subgingival plaque, may mediate coaggregations or adhesive interactions typical of subgingival plaque. strains of a. odontolyticus from the tongue display fima and fimp hybridization patterns somewhat different from that observed for strain pk <dig>  <cit> .

all three fima protein variants contained a pilin motif for polymerization, e box for associated proteins and lpxtg motif for cell surface sorting and anchoring. the pilin, e box and lpxtg motifs were highly conserved among the three species, and present among the proline-containing domains suggested by yeung and cisar to account for folding or intermolecular interactions of fima and fimp proteins  <cit> . interestingly, the pilin, e box and lpxtg motifs are present in fimbriae proteins from c. diphtheriae, which have been used to express type- <dig> fimbriae from a. naeslundii, and in various other gram-positive bacteria expressing pili-like structures  <cit> . this suggests that gram-positive bacteria may have evolved related proteins and pathways for pili formation and function  <cit> . moreover, the serologically different properties of the fima proteins present in genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus could imply that the overall folding of the fima protein could form different functionalities or binding specificities. actually, the variant fima proteins did not cross-react with antisera despite many conserved motifs, which consequently may be hidden within the subunit or by intermolecular interactions. apart from the sequences unique to each species, we could not link any fima motifs or substitutions to the species-specific binding specificities or variant ha patterns of each genospecies. however, receptor-binding fima subunit domains or tip-localised adhesins other than the fima subunit remains to be identified. in this respect the unique presence of a proline-rich segment in fima but not in fimp proteins is interesting, but of yet unknown biological significance.

another interesting finding of the present study is the possible sortase-independent oligomerization of fima in solution. western blot analyses revealed fima oligomers in whole cell protein extracts and, more importantly, mono to oligomers of fima in purified recombinant fima preparations. sortase, which is absent in gram-negative e. coli used for expression of recombinant fima protein, catalyses the covalent tethering of fima subunits through pilin and lpxtg motifs when expressed in gram-positive c. diphtheriae  <cit> . it remains, however, to be determined whether the pilin motif and/or other conserved subunit motifs are involved in this sortase-independent ability of fima to oligomerize in solution. finally, it is reasonable to assume that the spontaneous ability of fima to di- to oligomerize acts in conjunction with sortase in the whole cell-dependent process of fimbriae assembly and polymerization.

the unique and conserved nature of fima for each actinomyces species or subspecies reinforces the important role of fima in selection of ecological niches. moreover, the highly conserved nature of fima within a subspecies could also indicate an immunological tolerance to this protein on actinomyces species that early colonize the oral cavity of infants  <cit> . the conserved nature of fima is different to the antigenic variation found in p-fimbriae-associated papg adhesins on uropathogenic escherichia coli  <cit> . based on its unique and conserved nature, we have previously designed dna probes from particular fima segments to distinguish between clinical isolates of genospecies  <dig> and  <dig>  we assume that corresponding fima segments unique to a. odontolyticus could be used in a similar way to generate probes specific to particular receptor-binding subtypes of this organism.

while different galβ specificities of genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> target the two species to glycolipid or glycoprotein receptors  <cit> , respectively, a. odontolyticus pk <dig> recognizes sialic acid residues on glycoproteins. both glycolipids and glycoproteins are capable of mediating adhesion and intra-cellular signalling by epithelial cells. the host responses mediated by a glycolipid or a glycoprotein receptor may be different, and hypothetically relate to the commensal or pathogenic potential of actinomyces subtypes. moreover, the galβ and sialic acid binding specificities may target a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus to different bacterial partners, in particular since they belong to different coaggregation groups. in this respect, it is notable that sialidase, which modifies the hemagglutination properties of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus in the opposite way, is produced by actinomyces and other plaque bacteria  <cit> . however, whether a. naeslundii or related coaggregation communities use sialidase to compete with a. odontolyticus in vivo is unknown. finally, a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus are interesting model bacteria for studying the role of fimbriae proteins and their receptors specificities in microbial colonisation and host-microbe interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
this report shows three unique subgroups of fima proteins in a. naeslundii genospecies  <dig> and  <dig> and a. odontolyticus, and that each subgroup coincides with a unique carbohydrate binding specificity. all fima proteins contained a pilin motif for polymerization, e box, and lpxtg motif for cell surface sorting and anchoring. finally, a sortase independent oligomerization of fima subunit proteins in solution was indicated.
