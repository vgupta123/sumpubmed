BACKGROUND
consumer awareness of the long-term health benefit of fruit consumption has significantly increased the demand for high-quality fresh fruit. postharvest disorders of fresh fruits are a major factor contributing to product deterioration and crop losses. many such disorders are physiological in origin and may be related to time of harvest , season and growing region, as well as cultivar . a range of postharvest treatments is traditionally employed to minimise disorders and typically a single treatment is not enough to control a postharvest disorder. however, new technologies in molecular genetics and metabolomics now enable us to dissect the control of fruit postharvest disorders into fine-scale determinants that include biochemical and genetic controls and provide some hope for development of more targeted solutions.

friction discolouration  is a serious postharvest disorder in pear generally categorised by diffuse brown skin marks that occur as a result of mechanical damage and lead to the enzymatic browning of the fruit skin. mechanical damage can occur at any step during picking, sorting, processing or transportation  <cit> . fd is different from bruising as it is confined only to epidermal layers, with no damage to flesh. although nutritive value and flavour is not affected by fd, the unattractive appearance of the fruit results in consumer dissatisfaction and reduced prices, which can lead to severe market losses  <cit> . mechanical injury also enhances respiration and moisture loss from the injured area, as well as ethylene production, a combination that may speed ripening and reduce shelf life.

the underlying mechanism behind fd involves a combination of physical stress and biochemical reactions, in particular the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols by polyphenol oxidase   <cit> . polyphenols are the specific substrates for the underlying browning reaction in fd, with cholorogenic acid being the most abundant phenolic compound in pears and generally believed to play the most crucial role in enzymatic browning  <cit> . other factors may also contribute to differential fd susceptibility, such as the activity of ppo and the concentration of ascorbic acid  as a key inhibitor to enzymatic browning  <cit> . additionally, the nature of the skin surface may influence its susceptibility to physical damage  <cit> . some varieties of pear are known to be more or less susceptible to fd, indicating underlying genetic determination, but still, fruit susceptibility can vary with the maturation stage of a single cultivar. it also has been noted that european species are less susceptible than asian species in general  <cit> . the plant & food research  pear breeding programme  applies strong selection pressure against fd  <cit>  and this process would be greatly benefitted by the application of marker-assisted selection  at the seedling stage, to enable selection of genotypes with low genetic potential to develop fd. however, the detailed phenotypic analysis required for trait association with genetic markers has seldom been undertaken in pear for any fruit quality parameters, let alone one as complex as fd.

quantitative trait loci  for fruit traits, such as fruit shape, sugar content, acid content, vitamin c content, maturity, and fruit skin composition have been mapped in a range of fruit crops, including tomato  <cit> , peach  <cit> , apple  <cit> , strawberry  <cit> , sweet cherry  <cit> , apricot  <cit>  and papaya  <cit> , among others. there is a single report on qtl analysis of pear fruit characters by zhang et al.  <cit> , in which qtls for traits such as fruit weight, diameter, length, soluble solid content, fruit shape index, and maturity date were identified in chinese pear  cultivars ‘bayuehong’ and ‘dangshansuli’. there are two reports in apple  <cit>  and one in melon  <cit>  evaluating the qtls associated to fruit physiological disorders, however, none of them has used systematic approach to evaluate the genomic regions  linked to disorder as well as characters influencing fruit. also, our study is the first focusing on genetic solution to a postharvest disorder in pear.

a number of genetic maps for pear have been developed for the purpose of trait mapping, using a range of molecular markers, including rapds   <cit> , aflps , ssrs   <cit>  and sequence-related amplified polymorphisms   <cit> . however, none of these maps has been developed directly from pyrus genome sequences. recently, wu et al.  <cit>  used next generation sequencing to develop a dense interspecific genetic map of ‘bayuehong’  × ‘dangshansuli’  comprising  <dig> snp  markers, to anchor the chinese pear genome. however, there are no reports to date of trait mapping in this population using these  <dig> snps. more recently, the international rosbreed snp consortium  illumina infinium® ii 9k apple and pear snp chip  <cit>  was developed for genetic mapping of traits in five segregating populations of pear, including two interspecific populations segregating for fd.

although there are previous studies on postharvest aspects of fd  <cit> , there has been no attempt to explore systematically the genetic basis and control of this disorder. hence we have focussed first on developing an in-depth understanding of the variation of phenotypes that might be associated with fd development  among the different genotypes in our mapping populations. here the goal is to identify factors that might influence the development of fd and hence differential susceptibility to this disorder. breeders have reported a high narrow sense heritability  among inter-specific pear breeding populations, including both populations under study, which suggested that comprehensive genetic gain could be obtained for fd  <cit> . our strategy utilises this phenotypic analysis for subsequent qtl analysis to identify genetic loci associated with fd, utilising two related populations in which individuals segregated for susceptibility to fd. our study is the first report of the use of a snp-based dense genetic linkage map for qtl analysis in pear, as well as the first systematic investigation of the genetic control of a postharvest disorder in pear.

methods
plant material and fruit sampling
two full-sib families  resulting from interspecific crosses between asian  and european pears   were grown at the motueka research centre, pfr, motueka, new zealand. pop <dig> is a population of  <dig> full-sib genotypes from a cross between pop369-female and pop369-male. both families were planted on their own roots into the orchard in  <dig> at row spacing of  <dig> m and in row spacing of  <dig>  m. plants received a standard fertiliser programme and any branches at least one meter above the wire trellis at a height of  <dig> m were bent down to the wire in january each year. trees that had not commenced fruiting were girdled in december with a vaca cane girdler, which removed a  <dig> mm horizontal strip of vascular tissue below the  <dig>  m wire. fruit from  <dig> seedlings from the pop <dig> population were harvested for phenotype and qtl analysis in  <dig> and  <dig>  pop <dig> was a population totaling  <dig> full-sib genotypes from a cross between pop356-female and pop356-male parent. fruit from  <dig> seedlings from the pop <dig> population were collected for phenotype and qtl analysis in  <dig>  fruit harvest for each genotype began when fruit had a green-yellow background colour and were harvested every 7– <dig> days until fruit ran out. fruit was stored for  <dig> to  <dig> days at 3°c for initiation of ripening, and then transported to pfr palmerston north by refrigerated truck for further analysis.figure  <dig>

friction discolouration assessment
to assess fd, four random fruit were selected per seedling, removed from the cool store and kept overnight at room temperature. fd was induced the next day by rubbing the fruit twice against a fiber tray cup surface  <cit> . after another  <dig> h at room temperature, browning area and intensity was recorded on a 0– <dig> scale, where  <dig> is absence of fd and  <dig> is the highest fd score . fd was scored by the same single assessor in  <dig> and  <dig> to reduce experimental error. fd score was averaged across all four fruit for each seedling and harvest date.figure  <dig> 
visual scale for friction discolouration  score assessment in pear.




total soluble solids and firmness
total soluble solids content  and fruit firmness were measured using two of the same fruit on which fd was determined. equal amounts of juice from both ends of the fruit were used to assess tss  using a digital refractometer . compression firmness was measured in newton  at two points separated by 180° around each fruit equator, using a texture analyser ta-xt plus  fitted with a  <dig>  mm probe. tss and fruit firmness was averaged across both fruits and harvest date for each seedling.

peel sample preparation and extraction for polyphenol and asa quantification
peel of  <dig> mm thickness, consisting of fruit skin with underlying flesh was removed from the equatorial area of 4– <dig> fruit per genotype , snap frozen and then ground together with a pellet of dry ice, using a coffee grinder. ground peel tissue was stored frozen at −80°c until further analysis. extraction solution  was added to  <dig> g of finely ground peel and left for  <dig> h at 4°c. after  <dig> h, culture tubes containing the extract were centrifuged  at 20 ± 2°c and the extracts were sampled directly into high performance liquid chromatography  vials. aliquots of the extracts were diluted in cold solvent  prior to polyphenol analysis.

polyphenol quantification in pear peel
polyphenol content of these extracts was analysed using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry  system that comprised a dionex ultimate®  <dig> rapid separation lc system and a microtof-qii mass spectrometer  fitted with an electrospray source operated in negative mode. the analytical column was zorbax™ sb-c <dig> hd,  <dig>  ×  <dig> mm,  <dig>  μm . solvents used in  <dig> were a = 90% methanol, and b =  <dig> % formic acid in water , with a gradient of 5% a, 95% b for 0– <dig>  min; gradient to 40% a, 60% b from  <dig> - <dig> min; gradient to 75% a, 25% b from 8– <dig> min; and gradient to 100% a,  <dig> % b from 11– <dig> min. the composition was then held at 100% a from 12– <dig> min; decreased down to  <dig> % a, 95% b between 14– <dig>  min. the gradient of 5% a, 95% b was maintained until injection of the next sample. total run time for each sample was  <dig> minutes.

solvents used in  <dig> were a = 100% acetonitrile and b =  <dig> % formic acid with a gradient of 5% a, 95% b for 0– <dig>  min; gradient to 30% a, 70% b from  <dig> - <dig> min; gradient to 100% a,  <dig> % b from 10– <dig>  min. the composition was then held at 100% a from  <dig> - <dig>  min; decreased to  <dig> % a, 95% b between <dig> - <dig> min, and maintained until the next sample was injected. total run time for each sample was  <dig> minutes.

polyphenolic components were quantified using quantanalysis  by extracting accurate  mass ion chromatograms. as external standards were not available for all the detected compounds, we used peak area  for calculations involving phenolic concentrations for all the compounds.

polyphenol oxidase activity quantification in pear peel
ppo activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described in  <cit>  with a few modifications. extraction solution  and  <dig> g polyvinylpolypyrrolidone  was added to  <dig> g finely ground frozen peel. this mixture was homogenised and centrifuged  for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. each sample contained  <dig> μl extract,  <dig> μl reaction buffer  and  <dig> μl standard catechol solution . the assay procedure was carried out at 20°c with initial shaking for  <dig> sec. the increase in absorbance at  <dig> nm was then recorded by spectrophotometer  with readings at  <dig> sec intervals, and eight samples read simultaneously. enzyme activity was calculated from the initial  <dig> sec gradient of curves in  <dig>  and initial  <dig> sec in  <dig>  ppo activity is presented as the change in absorbance at  <dig> nm per gram fresh pear peel per minute .

ascorbic acid quantification in pear peel
asa content in pear fruit peel was quantified on an alliance  <dig> hplc . solvent-based peel extracts  were diluted 1: <dig> with tris- phosphine and incubated in the dark for  <dig> minutes. asa was resolved using a synergi  <dig> μm hydro  <dig>  ×  <dig> mm  reversed phase column protected with a guard column of the same packing. column temperature was set at 40°c. the solvents used were a =  <dig> % v/v phosphoric acid  and c = 70: <dig> methanol/milli-q water  with proportions remaining the same throughout the run. sample injection volume was  <dig> μl and flow rate was  <dig>  ml per minute. total run time for each sample was set at  <dig> min isocratic run time. an external calibration curve was constructed for asa based on three standards with concentrations  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml, respectively. quantification of asa was based on peak areas determined at  <dig> nm in  <dig>  and  <dig> nm in  <dig>  chromatographic data were collected and manipulated using a chromeleon® chromatography management system version  <dig> . the asa concentration derived from the hplc analysis was transformed from μg/ml  to μg/g  of fresh weight by dividing cv by the fresh weight of the sample.

statistical analysis
minitab® version  <dig> . <dig> was used to test the trait distribution, to calculate the pearson correlation of the traits, and to perform analysis of variance .

dna extraction and snp screening
for the pop <dig> population, dna from  <dig> full-sibs and the pollen parent was purified from young leaves using a ctab  extraction method  <cit> , followed by column purification using the nucleospin® kit . for the pop <dig> population, dna from  <dig> full-sibs and the pollen parent was extracted using the qiagen dneasy plant kit . dna could not be prepared from the female parent of pop <dig> and pop <dig> common to both populations as trees of this genotype no longer existed in the field. dna quantifications were carried out using a nanodrop™ 2000c spectrophotometer .

genomic dna  from progeny and male parents was amplified and hybridised to the apple and pear irsc 9k snp array  <cit>  following the illumina infinium® hd assay ultra protocol  and scanned with the illumina iscan. data was analysed using illumina’s genomestudio v <dig>  software genotyping module, setting a gencall threshold of  <dig> . the software automatically determines the cluster positions of the aa/ab/bb genotypes for each snp and displays them in normalised graphs. a systematic method was used for evaluating the snp array data using quality metrics extracted from genomestudio : gentrain score ≥  <dig> , minor allelic frequency  ≥  <dig>  and call rate > 80%. the genotype of the female parent was inferred manually on the basis of the genotype of the other parent and progeny. snps that were highly distorted or which had the genotype of one or both parents missing were manually edited in genomestudio. furthermore, the snps for which 25% and 50% of the individuals were not called in clusters were manually edited, since this could be due to null allele segregation.

genetic map construction and qtl mapping
the genetic maps of the four parents of the two populations were constructed using double pseudo test cross methodology  <cit>  and joinmap v <dig>  software  <cit>  based on the snp data for the individuals in each population. linkage groups were determined with a lod score of  <dig> or higher for grouping and the kosambi mapping function was used for genetic distance calculation.

linkage group numbering was determined using apple snps  <cit>  anchored to the reference genome of ‘golden delicious’. furthermore pop <dig> shares a common parent with a population published earlier in  <cit>  that has  <dig> simple sequence repeats mapped to enable lg numbering that is consistent with previously published pear and apple maps. the alignment of male parental maps from both populations is provided in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

the four parental maps were drawn and aligned using mapchart v <dig>   <cit>  and qtl analysis was performed using mapqtl  <dig>   <cit> . for individual seedlings with more than one fruit harvest, both average and maximum score of the data were used as phenotypic data, where fd score was expressed for each individual as maximum fd and average fd. the data distribution for each compound was verified before the qtl analysis. qtls were identified using the kruskal-wallis test  because most of the traits were not normally distributed. snps are presented using the ncbi dbsnp accession number  and snps with null alleles are represented with the prefix ‘null’.

having more than one harvest from some genotypes provided the opportunity for comparison of the fd susceptibility between fruit at different stages of maturity. fd susceptibility showed substantial variation between different harvests, genotypes and even between fruit of the same genotype . both populations showed a variety of trends for fd incidence with different harvest dates for same genotypes. of  <dig> genotypes with multiple harvests in  <dig>  five genotypes of the pop <dig> population exhibited low fd at early harvests and high fd at later harvests. however, within the same segregating population, two genotypes exhibited a decrease in fd susceptibility later in the season. there were  <dig> genotypes that did not show any variation of fd score between the harvest dates, with  <dig> genotypes scoring consistently low, and two exhibiting a consistently high score . in  <dig>   <dig> genotypes from pop <dig> with multiple harvests exhibited different trends for fd scores, comprising  <dig> increasing, seven decreasing,  <dig> stable high and  <dig> stable low fd genotypes, as the season advanced . pop <dig> in  <dig> had  <dig> genotypes with multiple harvest, also exhibited four different trends where seven genotypes exhibited increasing,  <dig> genotypes decreasing and  <dig> genotypes did not show any variation of fd score between the harvest dates, with  <dig> genotypes scoring consistently low, and five exhibiting a consistently high score . over all in both populations across the years, over 50% genotypes were consistent in their trend of susceptibility either consistently low or consistently high.figure  <dig>

in the pop <dig> population, weak correlations of r =  <dig>   and r =  <dig>   were observed between fd and harvest date in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, although no such significant correlation was found in the pop <dig> population in  <dig>  analysis of variance in the pop <dig> population indicated a significant effect of year, explaining 4% of the phenotypic variation in fd , whilst the effect of genotype and harvest date accounted for a higher proportion of the phenotypic variation, at 54%  and 23% , respectively. although interaction between genetics and harvest date was not significant, the effect of the genetics x year interaction accounted for 22% of the phenotypic variation in fd .

polyphenolic compound, asa concentration and ppo activity in pear segregating populations
a subset of  <dig> polyphenol compounds was identified by using the quantanalysis software. this subset included flavanols, flavonols, procyanidins, two unknown compounds  and chlorogenic acid. chlorogenic acid was the most abundant polyphenol found in pear fruit peel in both populations in both years. the concentration of all  <dig> polyphenolic compounds varied among individual progeny in both populations, and showed significant correlation with fd for some compounds, however none showed high correlation values with fd . overall these compounds are negatively correlated with fd, as is clear in table  <dig> 

although individual progeny exhibited a wide range of ppo activity in fruit for both years, ppo activity was weakly correlated with fd for pop <dig> in  <dig> only. a weak yet significant negative correlation between concentration of some of the polyphenol compounds and ppo activity was observed in the  <dig> data from population pop <dig>  where ppo activity and epicatechin concentration exhibited a significant  correlation . asa concentration showed a significant correlation with harvest date for both populations in  <dig> and no correlation in  <dig> for pop <dig> . no significant correlation was observed between fd and asa concentration.

genetic map construction
parental genetic maps were constructed for pop <dig> and pop <dig> populations using a subset of  <dig> and  <dig> polymorphic snps, respectively. the genetic maps for qtl analysis were modified from the maps described in  <cit> , by removing dominant markers with the segregation ratio 3: <dig> in order to improve their utility for qtl mapping. numbers and segregation types of polymorphic, mapped, and revised for qtl map markers are provided in table  <dig> and for detailed maps used for qtl analysis see additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the revised parental maps of the pop <dig> population comprised  <dig> and  <dig> markers for the male and female parents, respectively. the pop369-male parental map spanned  <dig>  cm  over  <dig> groups across the  <dig> lgs, of which lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were split into two parts. the pop- <dig> female parental map spanned  <dig>  cm  over  <dig> groups across the  <dig> lgs, of which lgs  <dig> and  <dig> were split into two, and lg <dig> into three parts. the map of pop356-female consisted of  <dig> markers covering  <dig>  cm and had  <dig> groups across the <dig> lgs, with  <dig> markers in common with the pop369-female map. the pop356-male map comprised  <dig> snps covering  <dig>  cm and spanned  <dig> groups across the 17lgs .table  <dig>

qtls were detected for  <dig> fruit traits, including fd score , tss, fruit firmness, ppo activity, asa concentration and lc-ms peak area  for  <dig> polyphenolic compounds. a total of  <dig> qtls with significance of p <  <dig>  were detected for the  <dig> traits over two years for the pop <dig> population , and  <dig> qtls for the pop <dig> population . the largest cluster, which comprised  <dig> qtls associated with fruit firmness, ppo activity, concentration of asa and five polyphenolic compounds , was identified on lg <dig> in pop <dig> for both parents. the largest cluster for both parents of population pop <dig> is located on lg <dig>  with  <dig> qtls associated with the concentration of polyphenolic compounds .table  <dig>

qtl for friction discolouration of fruit
as fd was non-normally distributed in both populations , the kruskal-wallis test was used for qtl analysis. a total of  <dig> qtls over  <dig> chromosomal regions  were detected for fd, using the average and maximum score of multiple harvests in  <dig> and  <dig> for population pop <dig> , with the proportion of genotype explained by each qtl ranging from  <dig> % to 13%. in general, the qtls in common were for average and maximum fd scores . the qtl detected on lg <dig> derived from the pop369-female parent was stable between years when either the maximum or average fd score data classes were used, with the homozygous aa genotype for marker ss <dig> linked to low fd score . the qtl on lg <dig> of the pop369-male parent was not stable between years, as it only exhibited a strong effect in  <dig>  however a weaker effect qtl in  <dig> was identified in another location of the same lg for the same parent. the homozygous aa genotype for marker nullss <dig> from lg <dig> was linked to low fd score in  <dig> . the marker information from qtls on lg <dig> and lg <dig> from pop <dig> was combined into four possible genotypic combinations  and compared with phenotype data from those multi-harvest date seedlings categorised into the four fd groups shown in figure 3a,b . in  <dig>  seedlings lacking both lg <dig> and lg <dig> qtls  exhibited a consistently high fd score , increasing  or decreasing  with late harvest date, with none that showed a consistently low fd. however, the seedlings with genotypes associated with low fd for both qtls  had consistently low , decreasing  and increasing  fd scores during the season, while there were no seedlings with consistently high fd. the trend was not as clear in  <dig>  probably due to the weaker effect of the lg <dig> qtl in this year however, four seedlings having consistently high fd scores also lacked the low fd qtl genotypes for both lg <dig> and lg <dig>  another fd qtl for pop369-female was located on lg <dig>  however, the allelic trend was inconsistent between years .figure  <dig>

in total,  <dig> qtls over five chromosomal regions  were detected in the pop <dig> population using the average and maximum fd score, with genotypic variation explained ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . the qtls on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> were common to both parental maps in the pop <dig> population. common qtls between populations are located on lg <dig> of the pop356-male parent and both parents of population pop <dig>  however, for pop369-female parent this qtl was observed in  <dig> only .

qtls for fruit firmness, tss, ppo activity and asa concentration
a qtl linked to fruit firmness identified at the top of lg <dig> for both parents of both populations was stable between  <dig> and  <dig> for the pop369-male parent. although tss exhibited no stable qtl between years, tss qtls on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> were detected for both parents of pop <dig> in  <dig>  a qtl associated with ppo activity identified on lg <dig> of pop369-male was stable across the years and was detected only in  <dig> in the pop369-female parent. the pop <dig> population had a qtl for ppo activity on lg <dig> for both parents, however, no qtl was detected on lg <dig> as for pop <dig> . other qtls associated with ppo activity that were unstable between years were located on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for pop <dig>  and lgs  <dig> and  <dig> for pop <dig>  qtls influencing fruit asa concentration were identified on lg <dig> of all four parental maps in  <dig> only .

qtls for polyphenolic compound concentration
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> qtls were detected that were associated with the concentration of  <dig> polyphenolic compounds in pear fruit for pop <dig> and pop <dig>  respectively. qtls detected for polyphenols were identified on all lgs, except lg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for population pop <dig>  and lg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for population pop <dig> . the largest clusters of qtls associated with polyphenol concentration were located on lg <dig> of pop <dig> and lg <dig> of pop <dig>

discussion
the relationship of fd to fruit maturity
fd in pear is recognised as a complex postharvest disorder that is highly influenced by both genetic and environmental factors , as well as those related to development . our study supports this view, based on clear variation in susceptibility to fd, not only among the seedlings of the two segregating populations but also among fruit from the same seedling. this indicates that, while the genetic component of fd control is significant, there is also a substantial non-genetic effect. the significant correlation of fd to harvest date in population pop <dig> emphasizes the role of fruit maturity in the development of this disorder. harvest of fruit both before and after optimal maturity can increase the potential for development of fd. kvåle  <cit>  reported that fruit harvested before the climacteric peak are more susceptible to fd than are late harvested fruit. however, this hypothesis was later contradicted by burger et al. and mitcham et al.  <cit> , who found that late harvested fruit were more susceptible to fd. we noted these opposing trends in the interspecific segregating populations in our own study, as results from pop <dig> backed up the observation that late harvested fruits are more prone to fd, whereas pop <dig> exhibited the opposite trend, indicating that the effect of fruit maturity is a variable that is based on genetics. our study hence confirms the hypothesis by burger et al.  <cit>  that the relationship between fd and fruit maturity is not always consistent among genotypes. in their study involving two pear genotypes only, ‘packham’s triumph’ showed greater susceptibility to fd at late harvest compared with earlier harvest, while ‘comice’ exhibited the opposite trend. our analysis using the variation among hundreds of individual genotypes has highlighted even more clearly the complexity of the relationship between fd and fruit maturity.

pear maturity indices are complex and generally not reliable across the species as european and asian pear cultivars have different indices  <cit> , which are not reliable for interspecific progeny between asian and european type pear. the issue of optimum time of harvest is especially challenging for breeding populations obtained from interspecific asian x european hybridisation. although the indices currently employed to determine maturity for harvest  are the same as for apple, these indices may well differ between genotypes, orchards and/or seasons. in this study, fruit firmness and tss were measured in an attempt to evaluate fruit maturity of selected genotypes. while these traits segregated in both progenies, no relationship with susceptibility to fd was identified. this finding underlines the need for development of accurate fruit maturity descriptors in pear, especially for individual new cultivars of interspecific hybrids.

the potential relationship between fd and fruit polyphenol content
polyphenols are specific substrates for ppo and participate in the browning mechanism underlying fd. chlorogenic acid has been found to be the most abundant polyphenol present in pears  and we confirmed this finding in both segregating populations. neither this nor any other of the fruit polyphenolic compounds quantified over two years in two segregating populations totaling  <dig> seedlings showed strong phenotypic correlation to fd . this finding conflicts with previous reports, which demonstrated in a small number of commercial european pear cultivars that certain phenolic compounds, such as chlorogenic acid, act as a rate-limiting factor in fd incidence  <cit> . however, our experimental conditions utilising over  <dig> individual genotypes of a mixed p. bretschneideri, p. pyrifolia and p. communis heritage are very different to these earlier studies utilising a few commercial cultivars with known maturity and a much narrower p. communis species background. pear has very distinct cultivar variation for susceptibility to fd, as some varieties are recognized to be more susceptible to fd than others that have lower or almost no tendency to develop fd  <cit> . our statistical analysis of a large number of traits in over  <dig> individual genotypes from interspecific crosses strengthens the hypothesis that the relationship between fd and rate-limiting polyphenols cannot be generalised and therefore cannot be used as a selection criterion for new cultivar breeding. however, although the relationship between polyphenol compounds and fd may not hold true at the global phenotype concentration, it may be valid at the concentration of a qtl explaining part of the variation in a specific genetic background, justifying our decision to dissect and compare the genetic control of fd and other fruit traits by qtl analysis. indeed, we found that fd qtls co-located with qtls governing other traits that had been suggested previously to be associated with susceptibility to fd.

qtl co-location
co-location of qtls associated with different traits may mean that the qtls for both traits are tightly linked, or even that the same gene controls both. in the second situation this helps provide a clue to as to the nature of the molecular control underlying both traits.

an example is the qtl located on lg <dig> of pop369-female parent that was common for fd, ppo activity and chlorogenic acid concentration  along with epicatechin and procyanidin b <dig>  however qtl for ppo and chlorogenic acid were detected in  <dig> only but this could explain the relationship between fd, enzyme  and substrate . although we did not identify any strong statistical correlation among the phenotypes considered as a whole , when considering only the qtl cluster on lg <dig> of pop369-female, we observed that individuals in pop <dig> carrying the low fd allele exhibited both low ppo activity and a high concentration of chlorogenic acid . an opposing trend between chlorogenic acid and fd indicates that although the substrate amount is not crucial in terms of browning in interspecific pears, the ppo activity may play an important role. in this case, we could hypothesise that a candidate gene influencing ppo activity located in this genomic region of pop369-female parent, but not in pop369-male or pop356-male, might contribute to fd susceptibility via a stimulation of enzymatic browning in pear.

a second example is the qtl cluster for firmness, ppo, catechin and epicatechin detected between  <dig> and <dig> cm on lg <dig> of parent pop369-male . polyphenols, such as catechin and epicatechin, are substrates for ppo during the enzymatic browning that characterises fd. clearly, there are opportunities for further analysis, including mining the european  <cit>  and chinese  <cit>  pear genome sequences in the qtl region to identify candidate genes. although no candidate gene for the control of such compounds has been identified in the syntenic region on lg <dig> in the apple genome  <cit>  to date, the apple genome is another clear source of information.

polyphenol content of fruits and vegetables is dependent on fruit maturity, pre- and post-harvest operations as well as genetic characteristics  <cit> , and firmness is one of the most reliable indicators of maturity in commercial european pear cultivars  <cit> . our identification of a stable qtl on lg <dig> across years and populations, and in common for control of fruit firmness, ppo activity and polyphenol concentration, confirms reports of the physiological relationship between firmness and maturity in the accumulation of polyphenols  <cit> .

procyanidin b <dig> is an oligomeric compound, formed from catechin and epicatechin molecules and hence might be predicted to exhibit qtls in the same region as catechin and epicatechin. parent pop369-female exhibits similarly located qtls for epicatechin and procyanidin b <dig> on lg <dig> 

significance of stability of detected qtls
despite the complexity of the fd disorder and strong influence of environmental and developmental factors, we were able to identify  <dig> and  <dig> qtls for pop <dig> and pop <dig>  respectively  by using average and maximum fd score. none of these qtls can be regarded as a major qtl, as the strongest among them explains only  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. as we collected phenotypic data for the pop <dig> population in two consecutive seasons , qtls could be verified for their stability across years. a stable qtl across the years  <dig> and  <dig> was identified on lg <dig> for parent pop369-female . although the suggested fd qtl on lg <dig> was below the threshold of detection  in  <dig>  a likely reason for lower significance could be the large environmental and developmental effect on fd incidence. although a fd qtl is located on lg <dig> for pop369-female parent, the allelic trend is different between years , which implies that this qtl is an artefact. population pop <dig> had only one year  of phenotypic data, so it is not possible to verify qtl stability across years. however, this rather inbred population exhibits genomic regions on lg <dig> and lg <dig> that are conserved between its parents .

our qtl analysis indicated that fd is a polygenic trait controlled by many small effect qtls, of which only a subset are stable across years. the qtls on lg <dig> and lg <dig> provide closely linked markers, which are candidates that might be theoretically used for mas. however, these qtls individually explain only 8% of the phenotypic variation, which would provide only limited genetic gain if they were used for selection in a breeding population. also, when the qtls are considered in combination, none of the seedlings with the marker genotype associated with low fd exhibited a consistently high score for fd in  <dig> and  <dig>  no seedlings with the other homozygous ab type allelic pair appeared to have a consistently low fd score in  <dig>  but in  <dig>  eight seedlings of this group exhibited a consistently low score . these results point towards the possibility of using these qtls in combination for mas in bi-parental populations.

the polygenic control of fd by small effect qtls suggests that genomic selection may be a more suitable approach to cull susceptible seedlings early in the breeding cycle. genomic selection makes use of genome wide markers to predict total genetic value instead of phenotype and has been evaluated recently in apple  <cit> . in genomic selection, a prediction equation is established from genotype and phenotype data collected from the ‘training population’ and this prediction equation is used later to estimate genomic estimated breeding values  of individual progeny in the ‘selection population’  <cit> .

a number of qtls for other fruit traits were stable between years. parent pop369-male exhibited stable qtls across years associated with fruit firmness, ppo activity and concentration of chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, quercetin arabinose, as well as the unknown compounds  <dig>  and  <dig>  . some qtls were stable across the years for population pop <dig> and were detected in both parents. for example, a stable qtl controlling fruit firmness was located on lg <dig> and was stable across years and detected in the same location in both parents of pop <dig> and pop <dig>  likewise, another qtl associated with chlorogenic acid concentration was identified on lg <dig> for parents of both populations and was stable across both years .

from epidemiological studies, there is evidence that consumption of dietary anti-oxidants through eating polyphenol-rich fruits and vegetables can enhance cellular defence and help to guard against diseases, such as cancer, coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. chlorogenic acid has strong anti-oxidant properties and is the most abundant type of polyphenol in pear. breeders could use this qtl associated to chlorogenic acid to select genotypes rich in this compound. furthermore, candidate genes controlling fruit firmness in pear might be identified by utilising the stable qtl on lg <dig>  to identify candidate genes in the aligned genome sequences of both chinese and european pear, as well apple.

qtls orthologous between apple and pear
pear belongs to the pyreae subfamily of the rosaceae, which also includes apple, and their genomes are syntenic  <cit> . syntenic species conserve qtls for similar traits and this synteny information opens new possibilities for identification of candidate genes controlling similar traits across species. qtls associated with concentration of chlorogenic acid and its isoforms, i.e. cryptochlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic acid, located on lg <dig> of the pop356-female parent are orthologous to a qtl identified for control of chlorogenic acid concentration in apple  <cit> . interestingly, in the pop <dig> population both parents have qtls for the same variables on lg <dig>  which is homeologous to lg <dig> in apple  <cit>  and pear  <cit> . this homology in the malus and pyrus genomes indicates that these qtls may be derived from paralogous gene copies from the pyreae whole genome duplication  <cit> . in apple, a qtl for chlorogenic acid is also located at the bottom of lg <dig>  where the hct/hqt  gene is located  <cit> . the pyrus hct/hqt gene is therefore a strong candidate gene for the lg <dig> qtl from pop369-female.

a stable qtl governing pear fruit firmness is located on lg <dig> in the same region where a qtl for apple firmness has been detected previously  <cit> , however, no apple candidate gene has yet been proposed for this qtl.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike other more studied fruit species, such as tomato and apple, genetic information about the control of expression of pear fruit characters has been scanty to date. of four reported qtl mapping studies in pear , only one concerns fruit traits  <cit> . none of these studies employed gene-rich and snp-based genetic maps. these new generation maps provide advantages as they are derived from the pyrus genome sequence and hence identified qtls can be used to detect the candidate genes for these traits in the genome sequence. we have utilised the first snp-based genetic maps in pear  <cit>  to identify qtls for  <dig> variables, including fd, using two interspecific segregating populations . qtl clusters were found for all  <dig> variables with a number of qtls being stable across years, parents and populations. our qtls associated with fruit firmness and concentration of asa and polyphenolic metabolites are the first reported for pear. most notably, the qtls we detected that influence susceptibility to fd are the first fruit disorder qtls to be reported in a tree species. this study clearly demonstrates that this postharvest disorder is controlled by multiple small effect qtls, unlike fruit quality attributes, such as firmness and skin biochemical composition that are controlled by small and medium effect qtls. in future, candidate genes for qtls controlling firmness, ppo activity, and polyphenolic compound concentration will be identified utilising the reference genome sequences of pears ‘bartlett’, ‘dangshansuli’ and syntenic apple ‘golden delicious’. this will assist fruit biologists, postharvest scientists and pear breeders to develop an understanding of the genetic control of this highly challenging postharvest disorder. the polygenic nature of fd genetic control indicates that it will be difficult to apply marker-assisted selection, however, genomic selection could be employed to select elite genotypes with lower or no susceptibility to fd early in the breeding cycle. our results also point towards the need for better fruit maturity estimation to avoid the noise in phenotypic data.
