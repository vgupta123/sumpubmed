BACKGROUND
humans harbor complex bacterial communities in various body habitats such as skin, gut and oral cavities  <cit>  that contribute to both health and development of diseases  <cit> . b. fragilis and b. vulgatus from the genus bacteroides are among the most prevalent organisms of the human gut microbiome and constitute one of the largest bacterial contributions to the human fecal biomass  <cit> . both organisms are part of the normal flora of healthy individuals and contribute to certain important physiological functions such as breakdown of complex polysaccharides in the food and nitrogen cycling in the gut  <cit> . however, they are also capable of being opportunistic pathogens causing a range of anaerobic infections such as peritonitis  <cit> . both species, whose genomes have been completely sequenced , contain a large number of completely uncharacterized proteins, which are likely to play a role in microbiome-host interactions. in an ongoing effort to classify and characterize proteins repertoires of human microbiome bacteria, the joint center for structural genomics  has solved at high-resolution several structures of proteins belonging to bacteroides protein families that are over-represented in human gut microbiome. we report here a detailed analysis of two novel protein structures from b. vulgatus and b. fragilis. these structures map to pfam families pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  that were previously considered “domains of unknown function”. these are the first members of those families to be experimentally characterized.

RESULTS
structures of bacteroides proteins bvu_ <dig> and bf1687
the crystal structures of the n-terminally truncated bacteroides proteins bvu_ <dig>  and bf <dig>  have been determined to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å resolution, using mad and sad phasing methods respectively as described in the methods section.

despite a relatively low overall sequence identity of 24% , the two proteins are similar in structure. the structures of both bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> consist of two predominantly-beta domains . in bvu_ <dig> the two domains are connected by a short linker, while in bf <dig> the region between the two domains, contains a 4-helix insertion and an extra strand stacking with the twisted β–sheet of the c-terminal domain; this region forms extensive contacts with the second domain. the n-terminal domains of bvu_ <dig>  and bf <dig>  have an rmsd of  <dig>   Å for  <dig>  equivalent positions when performing a rigid  structural alignment . in comparison, the c-terminal domains  have lower  structural similarity with rmsd of  <dig>   Å for  <dig>  equivalent positions.figure  <dig>

proteins bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> . the n-terminal domain  and the c-terminal domain  of the 3kog structure show significant similarities with the corresponding domains of 3g3l structure . in contrast, the region connecting the domains  is clearly different in the two structures: a short linker in 3kog, an extended 4-helix insertion and one extra strand that is added to the c-terminal domain in 3g3l. a histidine-rich region present at the c-terminus in both of our proteins is found ordered only in the 3kog structure .

an uncharacterized histidine-rich region can be found at the c-terminal regions of both proteins . this region is not ordered in the 3g3l structure, but in the 3kog structure folds into distinctive structure characterized by two successive “hammer-head”-like loops . these loops pack against other loops connecting the strands of the c-terminal domain, together forming a hydrophilic exposed patch.

n-terminal domain 
the n-terminal domain of both bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> proteins form an 80-residue β-sandwich domain adopting a pre-albumin-like fold that is composed of a greek-key motif . this domain is currently classified as an uncharacterized pfam family pf <dig> . consistent with its observed structure, profile-profile comparisons using the hhpred algorithm  <cit>  consistently detect distant relationships with β-sandwich fold domains such as immunoglobulins and cadherins for our proteins with the pre-albumin-like n-terminal domains. however, it should be noted that the version of β-sandwich found in these domains is a more abbreviated version with conserved core of six β-strands. multiple sequence alignment for the pf <dig> family shows the presence of thr and ser residues at − <dig> and − <dig> positions relative to a strongly conserved cys residue, preceded by a hydrophobic signal-peptide-like sequence in the n-terminal region of the consensus sequence for the protein family . this motif is characteristic of a lipoprotein signal sequence  <cit>  implicated in anchoring the proteins into the cell membranes via lipid covalently linked to the conserved cysteine.

from our comparative genomics study , in preparation) of the metahit human gut microbiome analysis of  <dig> human subjects  <cit> , the average ratio of the number of homologs in the metahit human gut microbiome dataset versus those in uniprotkb  <cit>  is about  <dig> . compared to this, the ratios for duf <dig> and duf <dig> are about  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, suggesting their significant overrepresentation in the gut microbiome. the data also shows β-sandwich folds comparable to the fold of the n-terminal domain in our proteins occur frequently in proteins from families specific to the human gut microbiome . a recent functional genomic study points to a large number of bacteroides lipoproteins to carry an n-terminal β-propeller domain that may form an adhesion module  <cit> . similarly β-sandwich fold domains play important roles in protein-protein, protein-carbohydrate and protein-lipid interactions . hence, it is conceivable that these bacteroides β-sandwich domains have a key role in the cytoadherence functions of these bacteria.

similar folds in other bacterial cell-adhesion proteins
structural similarity search by dali  <cit>  for the n-terminal domains in our proteins identified several proteins in the transthyretin superfamily , such as: 1h8l from the carboxypepd_reg family pf <dig> , 3kpt from the cna_b family pf <dig> , 4eiu from the duf <dig> family pf <dig> , and 3dgd from the transthyretin family pf <dig> . the core of the domain common to these structures is a pre-albumin-like β-sandwich domain with four anti-parallel strands  in one sheet and strands  <dig>  and  <dig> forming the second sheet. there are still significant differences between these structures, particularly in terms of the strands constituting the β-sandwich: for instance, the n-terminal domains in our proteins are missing the strand  <dig>  while in the human transthyretin structure  an extra strand is present after the strand  <dig> and in the bacillus cereus pilin structure  a long loop with two short strands forming a β-hairpin is present between the strands  <dig> and  <dig>  yet another variation to this fold is seen in the repetitive b regions  of the staphylococcus aureus collagen binding protein , where the strand  <dig> is part of the β–sheet with strands  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the pre-albumin fold . a common theme between all the proteins with domains similar to the n-terminal domains in our proteins is that they act as cell-adhesion modules attached to a second domain with a distinct function, including enzymatic activity  <cit> .figure  <dig>

supporting the structural similarities reported above, distant homology recognition programs such as hhpred  <cit>  or ffas  <cit> , show statistically significant similarity between the family pf <dig>  and the families pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  of transthyretin clan, thus providing additional evidence that pf <dig> might be unified into that clan.

c-terminal domain
the c-terminal regions of both bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig> form a beta-strand-rich structural domain . the bvu_ <dig>  region is classified as a pfam family pf <dig>  with the standard pfam significance thresholds, while the bf <dig>  is not recognized by the pfam hmm model. however, profile-profile comparison methods  confirm the distant relation of the c-terminal domain of the bf <dig> protein and the pf <dig> pfam family. not surprisingly, the structures of n-terminal domains in both proteins are significantly similar , but with significant differences in lengths and torsion in the corresponding strands . structure based sequence alignment between the second domains using fatcat  <cit>  showed  <dig>  Å rmsd with about 11% sequence identity.

a structure-similarity search using the dali server  <cit>  identified the relationship of the c-terminal domain of bvu_ <dig> protein to the structures of hemolytic lectin from the mushroom laetiporus sulphureus  and the bacterial β-pore-forming toxins, clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin  and aerolysin . figure  <dig> highlights the structurally similar regions in similar colors. the c-terminal all-β structures are believed to play a role in forming pores that penetrate the cell membrane. a structural region  that is present in analogous positions in these toxin structures and the staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin structure  has been implicated in membrane insertion . by comparison, this region corresponds to a helix-loop in our structures, as opposed a two-stranded sheet or long loop between strands  <dig> and  <dig>  observed in the toxin structures. the n-terminal domains in these toxins are neither homologous nor structurally similar to the n-terminal domains in our proteins. further experimental characterization is needed to determine whether these structural similarities imply comparable lipid interaction functions for these bacteroides proteins or if they interact with carbohydrates as suggested in the case of the lectin from laetiporus sulphureus.figure  <dig>

domain interfaces
accessible surface areas for the n- and c-terminal domains in our proteins calculated using getarea  <cit>  and inter-domain interactions computed with pic   <cit>  show that the structure 3kog buries far less area at the inter-domain interface compared to 3g3l . the domain interface is fairly hydrophobic and is held loosely together by a few hydrophobic interactions and a number of weak to moderate hydrogen bonds . while the residues from the c-terminal domain in the 3kog structure that are buried at the interface are mostly not conserved in the family , about 40% of the buried residues of the n-terminal domain at this interface in both the 3kog and 3g3l structures are conserved in 70% or more of the sequences of the pfam family they belong to . this points to a key role for the interactions of the n-terminal domain for maintaining characteristic bilobal structure of these proteins. the computed molecular surface of 3kog  reveals the presence of a deep groove lined by the hydrophobic residues  at the domain interface. as shown in figure  <dig>  the above-listed residues are spatially close together supporting the contention that they could form a potential interaction surface. given their hydrophobicity, this groove could potentially accommodate a hydrophobic ligand, such as a lipid tail.

the two proteins, bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig>  despite considerable structural variations between their equivalent individual domains, have a domain interface, centered on the hydrogen bonded beta-sheet edges, that is largely conserved in the two structures. thus, it is likely that they have descended from the same multi-domain ancestral protein rather than resulting from independent domain fusions. their probable common origin is further supported by the observation of similar sequence motifs at both the n- and c-termini of these proteins that are shared by all the bacteroides proteins with the pf12985/duf <dig> domain.

CONCLUSIONS
crystal structures of two proteins, bvu_ <dig> and bf <dig>  from b. vulgatus and b. fragilis species of the genus bacteroides have been determined as part of the jcsg’s effort to carry out structure-based functional annotation of proteins that are part of the human gut microbiome. structures of both proteins show a comparable bilobed structure with a two-domain architecture: an n-terminal duf <dig> domain of pf <dig> family and a c-terminal domain characterized only in bvu_ <dig> protein as duf <dig> belonging to pf <dig> family. our analysis of these proteins based on sequence and structure comparisons suggests that the n-terminal domain might function as an extracellular adhesion or carbohydrate-interaction module that is linked to the bacterial membrane via a lipid anchor conjugated to the lipobox. this is consistent with similarities to proteins from the pfam transthyretin superfamily. as a result of this analysis, duf <dig> domain has been added to the transthyretin clan in pfam.

the c-terminal domain is structurally similar to bacterial pore-forming domain of toxins like clostridium perfringens epsilon and aerolysin. it remains to be seen if these c-terminal domains might mediate interactions with lipids in the extracellular matrix of these bacteroides species by themselves or via the inter-domain hydrophobic groove formed with the n-terminal domain. finally, the histidine-rich c-terminal regions, present in both of our proteins, but is found ordered in one of them, resembles a hammer-head motif of the set domains  <cit> . we speculate that this motif could mediate a specific interaction either with metals or charged moieties in the bacterial cell wall  <cit> .

preliminary evidence further strengthens the idea that the two proteins reported here are prototypical members of a substantial family of proteins that are widespread in the bacteroides genus. sequence profile analysis uncovers several additional lipobox-containing proteins from these organisms with comparable n-terminal transthyretin-like domains  and c-terminal histidine-rich segments. analysis of their gene-neighborhoods suggests that they are often accompanied by genes coding for proteins with ompa-like outer-membrane β-barrel domain and/or members of the duf <dig> family of proteins, which are also predicted to be lipoproteins . interestingly, multiple genes coding for transthyretin-like domain proteins of the pf <dig> family might also occur clustered together in the genome of certain bacteroides species . it is conceivable that the ompa domain proteins help in the trafficking of the proteins with transthyretin-like domains or that all of them  interact to form different types of membrane associated complexes. similarly organized loci with clusters of genes coding for β-sandwich domain proteins have recently been implicated in interaction with and utilization of complex carbohydrates like xyloglucan by bacteroides species  <cit> . in a similar vein, the structures and analysis reported here are likely to provide the models for a novel class of proteins utilized across the bacteroides group of bacteria for their extracellular interactions.
