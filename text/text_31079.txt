BACKGROUND
stereotypic behaviours are repetitive behaviours induced by frustration, repeated attempts to cope and/or brain dysfunction  <cit> . stereotypic behaviours typically appear in sub-optimal life conditions, i.e. known or believed to be aversive, e.g. physical confinement, social isolation and/or food deprivation. why and how such behaviours arise nevertheless remains a highly debated issue. one explanation, commonly known as the “coping hypothesis”, is that stereotypic behaviours may help the animal to “cope” with unfavourable conditions, by providing an “enrichment” in the sub-optimal domestic situations  <cit>  or by counteracting physical discomfort  <cit> . in striped mice rhabdomys, stereotypic animals even have a better reproductive output  <cit> , suggesting that some stereotypic behaviours may have beneficial effects. in horses, stereotypic mares however exhibit lower reproductive success  <cit> , and at present, the coping function of stereotypic behaviours remains a highly debated issue. according to the coping hypothesis, individuals that display stereotypic behaviours are expected to have lower physiological stress levels  than non-stereotypic animals in the same sub-optimal environment. attempts to link stereotypic behaviours with glucocorticoids however have yielded contradictory results. for example in horses, mcbride and cuddeford  <cit>  report higher plasma cortisol  levels immediately prior to a crib-biting bout, followed by a significant reduction post-crib-biting, suggesting that this stereotypic behaviour may have a coping function to reduce stress levels. on the other hand, pell and mcgreevy  <cit> , clegg et al.  <cit>  and more recently hemmann et al.  <cit>  report on the same species no significant differences in plasma and salivary cortisol levels between stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses . in contrast, mcgreevy and nicol  <cit>  and bachmann et al.  <cit>  report even higher basal plasma cortisol concentrations in adult stereotypic horses than in control non-stereotypic horses .

here we investigated specific correlates of oral and motor stereotypic behaviours and glucocorticoid levels in two large and very different samples of domestic horses kept in sub-optimal conditions and already known to experience poor welfare states  <cit> . we discuss two studies, both involving equine facilities where horses were kept in social isolation  and experienced time-restricted feeding practices, two factors known to trigger stereotypic behaviours e.g. <cit> . these two studies were complementary. study  <dig>  was performed on a working riding school population , already known to experience work-related disorders . study  <dig> involved  <dig> purebred arab brood mares  all housed in the same facility where the routine did not enable the horses to be turned out in paddock, and where mares had already been shown to experience poor welfare, e.g. altered time budgets  <cit>  and impaired reproductive success  <cit> . each horse was observed in its box using focal sampling  and instantaneous scan sampling . the oral and motor repetitive behaviours observed , long termed “stereotypy” or “stereotypic behaviours” either in the litterature e.g. <cit> , have all been previously described in horses . according to a recent re-definition of terms  <cit> , “stereotypy” is now reserved for a sub-class of highly predictable forms of repetitive behaviours caused by particular types of brain dysfunction  <cit> , a criterion not demonstrably met/ investigated to date for all the observed behaviours. in addition to the “classical” repetitive behaviours, following previous studies performed in other species and in horses, repetitive licking/biting  were recorded as further abnormal repetitive behaviours . note that we use here the term “stereotypic behaviours” as a broad descriptive term encompassing all repetitive behaviours observed, as they all typically appear in captive sub-optimal conditions that induce motivational frustration and/or physical discomfort. plasma sample collection involves handling of the animals and can be stressful, which may influence the results e.g. <cit> . thus we used plasma  and also faecal samples , the latter being a totally non-invasive method already well validated and used in horses e.g. <cit> , in order to assess cortisol levels. furthermore, faecal cortisol metabolites  concentrations reflect an average level of circulating cortisol over a long period rather than a point in time sample. therefore it provides a more accurate assessment of long-term cortisol levels than blood samples, which are highly dependent on the pulsatile secretion of glucocorticoids  <cit> . faecal samples were collected between 12: <dig> and 13: <dig> three times per horse on three different days in study  <dig>  and once between 08: <dig> and 10: <dig> in study  <dig>  the coping hypothesis generates the following predictions. in these sub-optimal life conditions, horses displaying stereotypic behaviours would have lower pc and fcm concentrations than non-stereotypic horses. moreover, within the sample of stereotypic horses, those with higher levels of stereotypic behaviours would have lower pc and fcm concentrations. oral and motor stereotypic behaviours can have different, though non-mutually exclusive, aetiologies, which can be e.g. gastric inflammation for oral stereotypic behaviours  <cit> , motivational frustration for social interaction and/or confinement for motor stereotypic behaviours  <cit> . therefore oral and motor stereotypic behaviour levels were considered separately.

RESULTS
study 1
stereotypic behaviours were observed in 65% of the horses in a total of  <dig> minutes of observation  with a median frequency of  <dig>  times per min . stereotypic behaviours were distributed as follows: repetitive trough licking , head shaking and nodding , lip play , repetitive object biting , repetitive wall licking , lip or teeth rubbing , weaving  and cribbing  . eighteen horses  exhibited more than one stereotypic behaviour. pc concentration varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ng/ml . concentrations of fcm varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ng/g . no difference appeared according to age . no difference appeared according to sex for fcm concentrations ; females however had higher pc concentrations than geldings  =  <dig> , q <dig> =  <dig> , q <dig> =  <dig> , med geldings  =  <dig> , q <dig> =  <dig> , q <dig> =  <dig> , f  <dig>   <dig> =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). interestingly, plasma cortisol concentration predicted fcm concentrations: the higher the plasma cortisol concentration was, the higher the fcm concentration was .

number in brackets following the name of the behaviour = number of horses observed performing the behaviour at least once.

whether or not the horse displayed at least one stereotypic behaviour did not predict pc concentration , and this was still true when oral  and motor stereotypic behaviours frequencies  were considered separately. similarly, displaying at least one stereotypic behaviour did not predict fcm concentration , even when oral  and motor stereotypic behaviours frequencies  were considered separately.

study 2
stereotypic behaviours were observed in 24% of the horses  and were distributed as follows: weaving , box walking , repetitive door kicking , head nodding  and lip play  . four horses  presented more than one stereotypic behaviour. concentrations of fcm varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ng/g . no difference appeared according to age  or reproductive status .

number in brackets following the name of the behaviour = number of horses observed performing the behaviour at least once.

again, whether or not the horse displayed at least one stereotypic behaviour did not predict fcm concentration , and the number of scans in which a stereotypic behaviour was observed also did not predict fcm concentrations either .

discussion
here we investigated specific correlates of oral and motor stereotypic behaviours and glucocorticoid levels in two large and different samples of domestic horses, kept in sub-optimal conditions and already known to experience poor welfare states. we used plasma and also non-invasive faecal sampling to measure cortisol levels. according to the coping hypothesis of stereotypic behaviours – i.e. that stereotypic behaviours are performed as a means of helping the animal to cope with sub-optimal environments by reducing stress – horses that displayed stereotypic behaviours were expected to have lower cortisol levels than non-stereotypic horses. furthermore within the sample of stereotypic horses, those with higher levels of stereotypic behaviours were expected to have lower cortisol levels. both pc  nor fcm  concentrations however differed between stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses, nor were they significantly predicted by stereotypic behaviour levels, even when oral and motor stereotypic behaviour levels were considered separately. therefore, cortisol measures do not indicate that stereotypic horses cope better, at least in terms of adrenocortical activity.

our results confirm the earlier findings of pell and mcgreevy  <cit> , clegg et al.  <cit>  and hemmann et al.  <cit>  indicating no significant relationship between plasma/salivary cortisol levels and stereotypic behaviours in this species. interestingly, this absence of a relationship between plasma cortisol and stereotypic behaviour levels appears to be independent of the time of plasma sampling. indeed, hemmann and collaborators  <cit>  report on not significant effects of crib-biting on cortisol circadian secretion when collecting plasma every two hours for  <dig> h in stereotypic and control non-stereotypic horses. when added to pell and mcgreevy’s  <cit>  and clegg’s et al.  <cit>  previous studies, where plasma was collected in the morning, our complementary results based on plasma samples collected in the afternoon support hemmann and collaborators’ conclusions. moreover, in the four previous studies  <cit>  in which plasma samples were all collected in the morning, results were also contradictory, indicating that time of sampling cannot be the main explanation for results discrepancy. in this context, using faecal samples, that reflect an average level of circulating cortisol over a longer period, appears nevertheless to be a good complementary strategy.

using faecal samples however might also raise a new methodological issue, namely a potential impact of variations in gut flora on the concentrations of cortisol metabolites. indeed, the metabolites of cortisol that are measured in faeces are the products of extensive modification by bacteria in the gut . as a consequence, the composition of bacteria could influence the type and/or the quantity of hormone metabolites . imbalance in hindgut flora  has been reported in horses displaying crib-biting  <cit>  and one could expect this imbalance to influence fcm concentrations in these animals compared with non-stereotypic horses and to bias the results. fcm concentrations however did not differ between stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses, nor were they significantly predicted by stereotypic behaviour levels, even when oral and also motor stereotypic behaviour levels were considered separately. to our knowledge, motor stereotypic behaviours have not been reported to be linked with gastric nor gut disorders in horses; therefore horses displaying motor stereotypic behaviours would not be expected to differ from control horses in regards to their gut flora composition. in addition, no significant relationship between stereotypic behaviours and cortisol levels appeared either when taking blood samples measuring the actual hormone . therefore, our results that cortisol measures do not seem to indicate that stereotypic horses cope better appear unlikely to reflect methodological bias due to sampling methods, though further research on the potential effect of gut floral on fcm concentration is warranted.

the idea that stereotypic behaviours may help animals to cope with sub-optimal environments is not new e.g. <cit> , but it is still a highly debated issue and evidence is sparse and contradictory. mcbride and cuddeford  <cit>  report higher plasma concentrations in horses immediately prior to the onset of a crib-biting bout, followed by a significant reduction post- crib-biting, suggesting that stereotypic behaviours may have a coping function that reduces stress levels in the animal. according to these results, the prevention of stereotypic behaviours may then be even more stressful and should induce a rise in glucocorticoids. in order to further test this prediction, two experimental studies have examined the effects of stereotypic behaviour prevention under controlled conditions on cortisol levels in horses. however, the environmental modifications used to prevent the stereotypic behaviours  induced a rise in plasma cortisol concentrations in stereotypic horses, but also in control non-stereotypic horses  <cit> . thus, the observed rise in glucocorticoids in stereotypic horses, initially expected to reflect a stress response due to the prevention of stereotypic behaviours but also observed in non-stereotypic animals, might simply reflect the horse’s response to environmental changes as previously suggested in rodents e.g. <cit> .

note also that, as reported in the literature, differences in cortisol levels between stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses do not support the coping hypothesis prediction. indeed, mcgreevy and nicol  <cit>  and bachmann et al.  <cit>  reported higher plasma cortisol concentrations in stereotypic horses than in non-stereotypic horses. one however may argue that higher cortisol levels in stereotypic animals could represent methodological bias, particularly when moving horses from their home stable to an experimental one and/or using frequently repeated blood sampling, which both could be stressful for the animals  <cit> . stereotypic horses may be particularly stress-sensitive individuals and they may perceive environmental changes and blood sampling as even more stressful than non-stereotypic animals, which may have impaired the results. in this context, using faecal samples – i.e. a totally non-invasive measurement, yielding no bias due to sampling procedure – to assess adrenocortical activity appears to be a better strategy and reinforces the earlier findings cited above that no relationship is evidenced between stereotypic behaviours and basal glucocorticoid levels.

on the whole, our results also do not support the coping hypothesis prediction, though several explanations for these negative results can be proposed. the absence of difference between stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses might reflect equally low cortisol levels, an interpretation which would, at least partly, support a coping function of stereotypic behaviours. bearing in mind however that horses can express poor welfare states in various ways , one may also argue that, in the experienced sub-optimal life conditions, both stereotypic and non-stereotypic horses were equally stressed, i.e. equally high cortisol levels.

another possible explanation for the results is that chronic stress levels might not be accurately measured by basal cortisol concentrations e.g. <cit> . cortisol has a circadian rhythm , a phenomenon well-evidenced in horses  <cit> . some chronic stressors have been reported to induce dysregulated pattern of hormone secretion, e.g. a flattened diurnal rhythm  <cit> . highly frequent blood collection can be a disturbing procedure in itself and is also clearly not always practicable or possible, especially in this study performed on working horses from riding schools. including a pc concentration assessment at least at the times where cortisol concentrations are highest and lowest  would allow a calculation of a slope as an indication of cortisol’s rhythm across the day, and would provide additional interesting information. note, however, that the effect of chronic stress on glucocorticoid circadian variations is still far from straightforward, as it might vary according to the stressor and individual features  <cit> . thus it would also be interesting to add other measures of coping to test further the coping hypothesis prediction.

beyond the potential functional explanation of stereotypic behaviours proposed by the coping hypothesis, another explanation for our negative findings may be that the performance of stereotypic behaviour is not associated with stress or coping at all. indeed, some forms of stereotypic behaviours are preservative and animals cannot stop performing them  <cit> ; stereotypic behaviours can become habit forming  and thus does not result in changes in cortisol levels; and/or the eliciting stimuli might no longer be present in the current environment e.g. <cit> . note however that the latter issue would be hard to test in our population since these horses are still experiencing several challenges to their welfare, such as confinement, social isolation and time-restricted feeding practices.

CONCLUSIONS
this is, to our knowledge, the first time that a non-invasive measure of cortisol  was performed in addition to plasma cortisol analysis in order to investigate the relationship between stereotypic behaviours and adrenocortical activity in horses. the present data do not show a significant relationship between stereotypic behaviours and both pc and fcm concentrations in two large and very different groups of domestic horses kept in sub-optimal conditions and already known to experience poor welfare states. this appears to be a general trend, as neither oral nor motor stereotypic behaviours predicted glucocorticoids levels. cortisol measures therefore do not seem to indicate that stereotypic horses cope better, at least in terms of adrenocortical activity.
