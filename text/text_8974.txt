BACKGROUND
ubiquitin is a 76-residue polypeptide that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. ubiquitylation of the lysine residues of substrate proteins targets the ubiquitylated proteins for degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for targeted degradation of key regulatory proteins and misfolded proteins  <cit> . ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, such as sumo, isg <dig>  nedd <dig>  and atg <dig>  function as critical regulators of many cellular processes including signal transduction, cell-cycle control, and transcription  <cit> . ubiquitylation is known to crosstalk with the phosphorylation process to modulate various regulatory networks  <cit> . for example, protein kinases can be regulated negatively or positively through ubiquitylation with or without degradation  <cit> .

a large number of genetic modifications have occurred in the human lineage during primate evolution that might be responsible for the emergence of human phenotypes  <cit> . these genetic modifications include the generation of novel genes and transcript variants  <cit> , loss of genes  <cit> , and acceleration of substitutions in specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences  <cit> . for example, the foxp <dig> protein, which is implicated in speech and language in humans, acquired two amino acid substitutions specific to humans after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees  <cit> . in contrast to chimpanzee foxp <dig>  human foxp <dig> differentially regulates genes involved in central nervous system development  <cit> . introduction of amino acids that are subject to post-translational modification , such as phosphorylation, during evolution, may be responsible for the reorganization of regulatory circuits  <cit> . some novel phosphorylation modification sites in human proteins that originated after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees have been identified  <cit> .

to assess the impact of ptms on human proteome evolution and to identify candidates for evolutionarily innovative ptm sites, a large amount of ptm data from human cells is needed. recent progress in high-throughput screening by mass spectrometric analysis has enabled the large-scale characterization of ptm sites in the human proteome, including phosphorylation sites  <cit> , o-linked β-n-acetylglucosamine modification sites  <cit> , lysine acetylation sites  <cit> , and ubiquitylation sites  <cit> .

we hypothesize that appearance of novel ubiquitylation sites in proteins along the human lineage during primate evolution may have modified protein regulatory networks, potentially resulting in the acquisition of novel phenotypic traits. to address this possibility, we developed a bioinformatics method to systematically identify gains of novel ubiquitylation sites in the human lineage during primate evolution. as a pilot study, we used ubiquitylation data for human proteins reported by kim et al. <cit>  and wagner et al. <cit>  as input data and then analyzed multiple sequence alignments of orthologous proteins from  <dig> mammalian species, including humans and  <dig> other primates. we then determined when the ubiquitylated lysine residues of the human proteins first appeared during primate evolution. kim et al. and wagner et al.’s datasets include lysines modified not only by ubiquitin, but also by ubiquitin-like proteins such as sumo, isg <dig>  and nedd <dig>  in this report, we therefore use the term “ubiquitylation” to indicate both ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein modifications.

RESULTS
detection and timing of gains of ubiquitylated lysines during human evolution
we aimed to identify human ubiquitylated lysines located in highly conserved regions of mammalian proteins that first appeared along the human lineage during primate evolution. to do this, a large amount of ubiquitylation site data and multiple sequence alignments of orthologous mammalian proteins are required. to assess ubiquitylation sites, one can use databases containing ptm data, such as uniprot  and phosphositeplus   <cit> , or large-scale analysis datasets  <cit> . in this study, as input data, we used  <dig>  non-redundant human ubiquitylation sites collected from the datasets of kim et al. <cit>  and wagner et al. <cit> , as well as  <dig>  mammalian protein alignments derived from the ‘multiz46way’ alignment data  <cit> . the overall procedure is illustrated in figure  <dig>  we filtered out cases where any euarchontoglires species or many non-euarchontoglires mammals had the lysine, or those where there were multiple copies of the protein in the human genome or the sequence conservation level was low. finally, we identified  <dig> ubiquitylated lysines in highly conserved regions of  <dig> proteins that appeared in the human lineage during primate evolution. a summary of our results is presented in additional file  <dig> and detailed alignments are provided in additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> proteins, one protein  acquired four ubiquitylation sites; four proteins  acquired three sites each;  <dig> proteins acquired two sites each; and the remaining  <dig> proteins acquired one site each.

the timing of the gain of a ubiquitylated lysine was determined by finding the branch that enclosed the earliest shared lysine between humans and other primates on the mammalian phylogenetic tree. for example, the human pml residue lys  <dig>  is shared with chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, but not with gibbon and other early-diverged primates. hence, this lysine was gained in the ancestor of the great apes after they diverged from gibbons. in some cases, the timing could not be determined precisely due to a lack of informative sequences. for example, lys  <dig> of the human birc <dig> protein  is shared with the other great apes  but not with other primates that diverged earlier. because the gibbon sequence is missing, however, it is not clear whether the gain of lys  <dig> occurred in the ape clade  or in the great ape clade . in such ambiguous cases, we inferred that the novel lysine residue was gained in the smallest clade that included all the species with the novel lysine residue.

in figure  <dig>  the distribution of the  <dig> ubiquitylated lysines gained in the human lineage is shown in the context of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. the numbers of lysine gains in each clade of the human lineage were as follows: humans, 13; humans and chimpanzees, 2; african great apes, 20; great apes, 6; apes, 32; catarrhines , 56; simians , 116; haplorhines , 8; and primates,  <dig>  when we surveyed the uniprot database to determine the molecular function of the novel ubiquitylation sites, we found that only two  have been functionally characterized . the potential functional roles of the remaining  <dig> sites have yet to be determined.

human-specific gains of ubiquitylation sites
of the  <dig> ubiquitylation sites,  <dig> sites were human-specific; that is, these ubiquitylated lysine residues evolved in humans after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. these proteins are casc <dig>  ciapin <dig>  dsc <dig>  ercc <dig>  fanca, kiaa <dig>  myo <dig>  nbr <dig>  ncapd <dig>  sco <dig>  sdr42e <dig>  slx <dig>  and trmt <dig> . in dsc <dig>  ercc <dig>  and sdr42e <dig>  the novel lysine position was polymorphic in humans, and the derived lysine allele was the major allele while the ancestral  allele was shared with chimpanzees and other apes. multiple sequence alignments for ercc <dig> lys  <dig> and nbr <dig> lys  <dig>  the two representative human-specific gains, are shown in figure  <dig>

dexperimental evidence for modifications: kim, kim et al. <cit> ; wagner, wagner et al. <cit> .

the ercc <dig>  protein, which is also known as xpd, is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and is implicated in cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum, trichothiodystrophy, and cockayne syndrome  <cit> . in the highly conserved c-terminal region of this protein, there is a human-specific ubiquitylated residue, lys  <dig> ; other mammals have either a glutamine  or an arginine  at this position . interestingly, this position is polymorphic in humans . the lysine  is the derived allele while the glutamine  is the ancestral allele that is shared with other apes and monkeys. in the human population, the derived lysine allele is the major allele with a frequency of  <dig> %. humans with the ancestral  glutamine allele have reduced dna repair capacity, indicating that the derived lysine allele confers enhanced dna repair capacity  <cit> . hence, the gain of a lysine at this position is advantageous in humans, although an association between ubiquitylation of the lysine and enhanced dna repair capacity remains to be demonstrated.

the neighbor of brca <dig> gene  <dig>  protein has been identified as one of the principle cargo receptors for selective autophagy of ubiquitylated targets  <cit> . abnormalities in nbr <dig> have been implicated in a type of progressive degenerative myopathy of older persons  <cit> . in a highly conserved region of nbr <dig>  there is a human-specific ubiquitylated residue, lys  <dig>  at which position all the other mammals examined have an glutamic acid  . this novel ubiquitylation site could play a role in the degradation or molecular function of nbr <dig>  however, it is also possible that the ubiquitylation of lys  <dig> was simply an indication of nbr <dig> degradation at the timepoint the experiment was performed.

other notable gains of ubiquitylation sites
of the  <dig> ubiquitylation sites,  <dig> sites in  <dig> human proteins were acquired along the human lineage during primate evolution, and are shared with chimpanzees and other primates . the promyelocytic leukemia  protein acquired three novel ubiquitylation sites in the human lineage: lys  <dig> in the great apes, lys  <dig> in the simians, and lys  <dig> in the catarrhines . these three sites are located within an eight amino acid range of one another. two of these sites, lys  <dig> and  <dig>  are modified by rnf <dig>  which is required for arsenic-induced pml degradation  <cit> . the pml gene is often fused with the retinoic acid receptor α  gene, which is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies revealed that pml has roles in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration  <cit> . it would be very interesting to investigate if the gain of these three ubiquitylation sites is associated with the evolution of the human nervous system.

human neuroguidin  has a ubiquitylated lys  <dig> that is shared with chimpanzees and gorillas, while other early-diverged primates  and all other mammals examined have a glutamine  residue at this position . ngdn functions as a translational regulatory protein by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factor 4e  and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding  protein, and is required for the development of the vertebrate nervous system  <cit> .

the scavenger receptor class b member  <dig>  protein is a plasma membrane receptor for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol . it mediates cholesterol transfer to and from hdl  <cit>  and is implicated in hepatitis c virus entry  <cit> . in this study, scarb <dig> lys  <dig> was identified as one of  <dig> ubiquitylation sites that were acquired in the apes .

we found that  <dig> novel ubiquitylation sites in  <dig> proteins first appeared in the common ancestor of catarrhine primates. one representative case is wd repeat-containing protein  <dig>  lys  <dig>  at which position most other mammals have a glutamic acid  . wdr <dig> has been implicated in spontaneous and tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated apoptosis  <cit> . wdr <dig> is required for cilia production; its disruption results in a range of human ectodermal, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities  <cit> .

of the  <dig> novel human ubiquitylated lysines,  <dig> in  <dig> proteins are shared with simians. one example is ataxin  <dig>  lys  <dig>  at which position all the other mammals examined have an arginine  . expansion of a cag repeat of the atxn <dig> gene causes spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  <cit> .

there were  <dig> human ubiquitylated lysines in  <dig> proteins that were shared by all primates identified in this study. for example, aurora kinase b  lys  <dig> first appeared in primates after their divergence from the common ancestor of euarchontoglires and is shared in all primates examined . non-primate mammals have either a glutamine  or an arginine  at this position. aurora kinase b is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex that functions as a key regulator of mitosis  <cit>  and is ubiquitylated by a cullin 3-based e <dig> ubiquitin ligase during mitosis, which coordinates precise mitotic progression and completion of cytokinesis  <cit> .

discussion
this report presents the results of a pilot study to systematically identify gains of novel ubiquitylation sites in the human lineage since its divergence from the common ancestor of euarchontoglires. to achieve this goal, we analyzed a human ubiquitylation dataset obtained from large-scale analyses  <cit> . we identified  <dig> novel ubiquitylation sites in  <dig> highly conserved proteins that first appeared in the human lineage during primate evolution,  <dig> of which are human-specific. we anticipate that application of our method to analyze the ubiquitylation data recorded in databases such as uniprot and phosphositeplus  <cit>  or collected by other large-scale analyses  <cit>  will result in identification of additional instances of gains of novel ubiquitylated lysines along the human lineage. we also expect that additional novel ubiquitylation sites will be discovered when higher quality protein sequences of non-human mammals become available. the total number of novel ubiquitylation sites we collected is likely to be an underestimate because of the draft quality of non-human genomes.

in addition to ubiquitylation, lysine residues can be modified by acetylation, and the cross-talk between these two lysine modifications is an important regulatory mechanism  <cit> . wagner et al. <cit>  showed that  <dig>  ubiquitylated lysines were also acetylated by comparing their  <dig>  ubiquitylation sites with the  <dig>  acetylation sites reported by choudhary et al. <cit> . to check whether any novel ubiquitylation sites identified in this study are also acetylated, we compared our data with  <dig>  non-redundant acetylation sites collected from the uniprot database and choudhary et al. dataset. we found that nine ubiquitylated lysines were also acetylated. these are dld lys  <dig>  fasn lys  <dig>  fdps lys  <dig>  gapdh lys  <dig>  ldha lys  <dig>  lrpprc lys  <dig>  mcm <dig> lys  <dig>  nup <dig> lys  <dig>  and parp <dig> lys  <dig> . thus, these nine newly-gained lysines can be modified not only by ubiquitylation but also by acetylation, suggesting regulatory cross-talk between lysine ubiquitylation and acetylation.

although gains of novel ubiquitylation sites do not necessarily equate to innovative and adaptive changes, they are useful candidates to evaluate when searching for advantageous genetic modifications during human evolution. it is also possible that the modified peptides could be simply derived from protein molecules destined to be degraded or being degraded in the proteasome at the time of the experiment. nevertheless, new ubiquitylation sites would provide novel target sites to modulate cellular processes by fine-tuning degradation, intracellular localization, or the regulatory network. recently, the origins and evolution of mammalian and yeast ubiquitylation sites were evaluated by analyzing their eukaryotic and prokaryotic orthologs  <cit> . the study revealed that ubiquitylation sites evolved at a similar rate to other protein modification sites such as phosphorylation sites, and that about 70% of  <dig> mammalian ubiquitylation sites first appeared during early vertebrate evolution. interestingly, some ubiquitylation sites that appeared during animal evolution have been suggested to be associated with development of novel cross-talk pathways with other modifications such as phosphorylation and hydroxylation. this report supports our notion that gain of novel ubiquitylation sites could result in the evolution of protein regulatory networks.

in the case of ercc <dig>  the human-specific ubiquitylated lysine site is polymorphic in humans. the derived lysine allele is the major or normal allele, while the ancestral  glutamine allele is designated as the mutant, which shows reduced dna repair capacity; carriers of this minor allele therefore have an increased cancer risk  <cit> . the gain of a ubiquitylated lysine in ercc <dig> can be regarded as a concrete example of adaptive gains identified in this study. molecular functional analyses of ubiquitylation sites collected in this study are likely to reveal more instances of advantageous functional outcomes.

interestingly, among the  <dig> proteins, nine proteins  have been found in human autophagy protein interaction networks  <cit> . nbr <dig> has been proposed to act as one of the principle receptors for selective autophagosomal degradation of ubiquitylated targets  <cit> . human nbr <dig> acquired a human-specific ubiquitylated residue, lys  <dig>  after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. eight other human proteins have novel ubiquitylated lysines that are shared with other primates. these nine proteins interact with known autophagy proteins such as n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  and beclin  <dig>  autophagy related   <cit> . it is possible that the gain of new ubiquitylation sites could provide novel regulatory interactions for autophagy and/or other programmed protein degradation processes.

hagai et al. <cit>  showed that some non-conserved ubiquitylated lysines are compensated for by nearby lysines, indicating that ubiquitylation sites can move from their original locations during evolution. in these case, the exact position of the ubiquitylation site is not critical for the regulation of the protein and may move over time; this phenomenon has also been observed in studies of phosphorylation sites  <cit> . to explore this possibility, we determined whether an alternative ancestral lysine residue was found in a small window surrounding the novel ubiquitylated lysine. we analyzed a window of ± <dig> residues  centered on the novel ubiquitylated lysine. a highly conserved lysine residue suggests that the site is a target for ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like protein modification. we found that  <dig> cases of  <dig> had no conserved additional lysine within the ± <dig> residue window, indicating that the sites that we identified are indeed new ubiquitylation sites. for example, the human-specific lysines of ercc <dig>  and nbr <dig>   were the only modifiable residues in the window evaluated. another example is naglu lys  <dig> , which is shared by all catarrhine primates. in  <dig> cases, there are one or more conserved lysines close to the novel ubiquitylated lysine. in these cases, we assumed that the protein acquired additional ubiquitylation site along the human lineage. as shown in figure 5b, there is a highly conserved lysine in the birc <dig> protein that is ubiquitylated in the human protein at the − <dig> position from the novel ubiquitylated lysine  <dig>  in the remaining  <dig> cases, the ancestrally conserved lysine disappeared as the novel lysine appeared along the human lineage, suggesting that the ubiquitylation site may have shifted. for example, there is a novel lysine residue  in the lrpprc protein  that first appeared in the common ancestor of apes. at the − <dig> position from this novel site, there is an ancestrally conserved lysine in mammals, including gibbons, but not in great apes, suggesting that the modified position moved by a single residue during evolution. this analysis indicates that the majority of the novel ubiquitylation sites identified in this study,  <dig> sites out of  <dig>  are new or additional ubiquitylation targets.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a bioinformatics method to identify novel ubiquitylation sites that evolved along the human lineage, resulting in the identification of  <dig> novel ubiquitylation sites. the gain of novel ubiquitylation sites could result in novel ubiquitin-associated protein regulatory interactions. proteins with a novel ubiquitylation site are useful candidates in the search for genetic modifications implicated in the emergence of novel phenotypes during human evolution.
