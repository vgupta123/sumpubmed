BACKGROUND
with over  <dig> described species  <cit>  and a global distribution, dung beetles of the subfamily scarabaeinae  provide important ecosystem services  <cit> . they are one of the primary utilizers of mammalian dung on earth and are historically one of the most recognized and best researched groups of beetles . recently, dung beetles have also become an established model group in ecology and developmental biology . however, a robust classification and phylogenetic hypothesis for dung beetles is not available despite many recent phylogenetic efforts . as a result interpretation of their evolutionary, ecological and developmental features is often limited to select species and large scale comparative analyses are practically impossible.

the currently accepted classification splits the scarabaeinae dung beetles into  <dig> tribes which, over the last two decades, have been the subject of  <dig> molecular- and morphology-based phylogenetic studies . these studies were reviewed in detail by  <cit> .

the results of most of these studies can be characterized by three common trends. 1) they resolve early branching clades or shallow nodes well, but intermediate nodes remain poorly resolved and/or weakly supported. 2) seven tribes are always recovered as monophyletic or nearly monophyletic , while three tribes  are always polyphyletic. the polyphyletic tribes deltochilini  and ateuchini  together comprise ca. 55% of the total generic diversity in this group. their highly polyphyletic concepts render the tribal classification in the entire subfamily extremely artificial. 3) the results of these key studies often propose conflicting hypotheses  <cit>  leading to a lack of consensus on dung beetle evolutionary history.

one morphological  <cit>  and two molecular phylogenies  <cit>  can be singled out due to their large taxon sample size and global biogeographic coverage; the rest of the studies are usually limited in these respects. the global morphological phylogeny of  <cit>  comprises all main biogeographic and taxonomic lineages and provides an integrative pattern of phylogenetic relationships in dung beetles largely supported by previous publications. however, that study also stresses the need for more data, primarily molecular, to corroborate its findings.

the two available global molecular phylogenies  <cit>  and  <cit>  are similar in composition of genetic markers  as well as species used. mtdna markers are known to be saturated by fast evolution and not very informative about relationships above the species level, while the 16s, 28s and 12s rdna markers are challenging to align and analyze with traditional substitution models. these mitochondrial and rdna genes are good candidates for resolving shallow divergences but they are less informative for recovering higher-level relationships  <cit>  which calls for assembling larger datasets to improve the robustness of phylogenetic inference.

in this paper, we reconstruct the phylogeny of dung beetles using a molecular dataset that comprises  <dig> terminal taxa and  <dig> gene regions. this is the largest dung beetle molecular dataset assembled to date, and includes a large quantity of newly sequenced data. in addition, the present dataset has a global biogeographic coverage and incorporates major phylogenetic lineages and enigmatic taxa. to infer the phylogeny we employed a wide range of analytical approaches including direct optimization , maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference . the traditional substitution models used in model-based methods  have been frequently shown to poorly reflect the reality of the evolutionary process  <cit> ; thus, their application can be inadequate for some molecular datasets. in this study, we explicitly test for model adequacy using bayesian posterior assessment  <cit>  and perform partition selection based on the adequacy of the selected models. although data selection guided by bayesian posterior assessment allows inferring some meaningful relationships absent in datasets where it was not used, the results of both were generally similar. the efficient application of data selection using model adequacy assessment to large datasets, as the one used herein, is presently difficult due to the lack of computationally advanced software. we conclude that the development of such software can, in future, boost progress of bayesian posterior assessment methods in phylogenetics.

our results identify new lineages and corroborate some relationships inferred by earlier studies . the consistency of clades between the molecular phylogeny presented here and the most recent morphology based analyses  <cit>  enables us to define new systematic concepts for the highly polyphyletic tribes dichotomiini, deltochilini and coprini. over the last half-century the concepts of these tribes have been constantly changing because clear synapomorphies which could ensure their unequivocal identification have always been missing. given the principle of monophyly, we limit these tribes substantially to accommodate only those genera which are closely related to their respective type genera. we use the synapomorphies identified by the global morphological phylogeny of  <cit>  to provide an effective identification of these tribes within their new definitions. many genera hitherto considered members of these tribes are now excluded from them. we treat those genera as incertae sedis and discuss the necessary steps towards their phylogeny-based classification. we also expand the concept of the tribe sisyphini by adding the genus epirinus that was previously placed in deltochilini.

methods
taxon sample and vouchers
a total of  <dig> specimens of dung beetles  belonging to  <dig> genera from all  <dig> tribes and biogeographic regions were sampled.  <dig> specimens from  <dig> species were sequenced specifically for this study. representatives of the following dung beetle genera are sequenced for the first time: haroldius, canthonella, cryptocanthon, homocopris, leotrichillum, paracanthon, paraphytus, scatimus, tesserodoniella, and trichillidum. the outgroup comprised  <dig> terminals belonging to  <dig> genera from the scarabaeidae subfamilies chironinae, aegialiinae and aphodiinae which are closest relatives of scarabaeinae based on previous studies . accession numbers and other relevant vouchers information is summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in all figures, tables, and additional files, specimens sequenced for this study are marked with * next to their species names. list of genera with author citations is given in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

in this study the tribal classification for genera follows  <cit> ; nomenclature for family-group names follows  <cit>  and  <cit> . along with traditional concepts for some tribes in the discussion we also propose newly circumscribed concepts, which are marked as sensu novo. the name ateuchini is used according to  <cit>  to address genera conventionally treated as dichotomiini  and the name deltochilini is used as a senior synonym for canthonini  <cit> .

molecular markers
we used  <dig> phylogenetically informative markers: 16s ribosomal rna , 18 s ribosomal rna , 28s ribosomal rna domain  <dig> , 28 s ribosomal rna domain  <dig> , cytochrome c oxidase i , carbamoylphosphate synthethase , topoisomerase i  and wingless . mitochondrial  and the nuclear rdna genes have been widely used in previous studies of dung beetles  and represent the bulk of data for this group in genbank. only three phylogenetic studies focused on africa and madagascar have used nuclear protein-coding genes cad and/or tp <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we use the nuclear gene wg for the first time in a dung beetle study along with the rdna regions  and cad, tp <dig>  we combine our new sequence data with the data from the same markers available in genbank  to address higher-level relationships of dung beetles  .

dna extraction, pcr amplification, and sequencing
genomic dna was extracted from the head and/or prothorax or legs, following the qiagen dneasy blood & tissue kit  tissue protocol. pcr follows  <cit>  with the following modifications: the reaction was performed in a 20 μl reaction volume using,  <dig>  μm of each primer, 10 μl amplitaq gold, master mix , and 3 μl of the respective genomic dna extract. if target genes were difficult to amplify  <dig>  μg bovine serum albumin  were added. the general pcr profile consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 °c for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °c for 1 min, 52–68 °c for 30 s, and 72 °c for 1-2 min, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °c. the annealing temperature was optimized separately for each pair of primers. tp <dig>  cad, wg were amplified using the nested pcr approach described by  <cit> . all primers used for amplification and amplification strategies are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  the pcr products were purified with exosap-it , and then sequenced. all fragments were sequenced in both directions. the genbank accession numbers of the sequences are given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction
the sequences were managed, edited and assembled into contigs, and the contigs arranged into the final datasets in geneious version r <dig>  <cit> .

for the phylogenetic analyses, alignments were performed with the web-based version of mafft  <cit>   using q-ins-i option, that takes into account secondary structure, for rdna genes with less than  <dig> sequences , and l-ins-i for the rest. the secondary structure for rdna genes was reconstructed in rnaalifold  <cit>  based on the alignments obtained from mafft.

simultaneous alignment and structure prediction for bayesian model adequacy assessment was performed using locarna  <cit> . the size of datasets that can be operated by locarna is limited to  <dig> sequences which make this method inapplicable for large phylogenetic analyses. in order to make computations feasible we reduced the dataset by randomly selecting a set of  <dig> sequences of each gene for model adequacy analyses to fit locarna requirements. simultaneous reconstruction and alignment in locarna better fits our purpose for the detailed exploration of partitions despite the necessary dataset reduction.

selection of sites, sequences and partitioning
site and sequence selection
the 3rd codon positions of coi were excluded from all analyses  as they have been suggested to suffer saturation for deep divergences which can potentially bias phylogenetic analyses . for some analyses, sites containing gaps in more than 20% of the sequences were also removed . the value of 20% was found empirically as an optimal trade-off between removing gap-rich sites capable of potentially introducing noise and, at the same time, keeping a sufficient amount of the original sites for the phylogenetic inference. finally, for the last set of analyses, in addition to the previously removed sites, we also removed the six partitions which yielded low p-values in bayesian posterior prediction . in total all datasets comprised ~40% of missing data due to incomplete sequencing, their alignment lengths were 5838 bp, 4775 bp and 4016 bp for all, g <dig> and dt <dig> datasets respectively.

in order to test sensitivity of the incomplete sequencing, we also composed two reduced datasets consisting of species for which at least  <dig> and  <dig> genes were assembled . each reduced dataset was also analyzed using maximum likelihood method with different portions of sites excluded .

partitioning
initially, the entire dataset was split into  <dig> a priori data blocks. this was done based on the secondary structure  for each rdna gene and based on domain structure and codon position for each protein-coding gene. the domain structure was obtained from interpro database  <cit>  using geneious interproscan plugin v.  <dig> . <dig> 

we used partition finder  <cit>  under bayesian information criterion  and the greedy algorithm option in order to find the best partitioning scheme and models. to partition the data for the phylogenetic analyses, we ran partition finder on the dataset from the mafft analysis using the  <dig> a priori data blocks and  <dig> randomly selected sequences to reduce computational time. the searches were performed on the set of models implemented in mrbayes excluding a subset of invariant site models, as using the invariant site and the gamma parameter at the same time is not advisable .

partition finder analyses of the  <dig> a priori data blocks  found best partitioning scheme comprising  <dig> partitions . in this scheme, loop and stem region of rdna genes were placed in a separate partition whereas protein-coding genes were partitioned by codon position and gene. since this partitions number was still high and could result in computational issues, we manually partitioned the rdna genes in only two partitions  and concatenated some partitions of the protein coding genes mainly based on codon positions. this reduced the number of partitions from the  <dig> inferred partitions to  <dig>  partition finder was run again  on the data set with  <dig> partitions resulting in a better bic score  and a scheme retaining the  <dig> partitions as initially set . the failure of partition finder to find the 10-partition scheme from the beginning  is likely a shortcoming of the greedy algorithm. the scheme from run# <dig> and the one with the best bic score were used in the ml analyses.

in the tests of model adequacy, the partition finder was run separately for each gene on its respective a priori data blocks from the locarna alignment results.

model adequacy assessment
the model adequacy assessment on big datasets, as the one used in the present study, is limited by the software capacity designed for such analyses and the lack of necessary computational pipelines. thus, as a proxy to model adequacy, we randomly selected a set of  <dig> sequences for each gene . each gene aligned in locarna was then split into its a priori data blocks and run separately in partition finder to test for the best partitioning scheme and models . to test models adequacy we used bayesian posterior assessment  as implemented in puma  <cit> . each inferred partition, after excluding sites containing gaps  was separately analyzed in mrbayes  to sample parameters from the posterior distribution. the sampled parameters were used to perform bpa in order to test whether the selected model can adequately capture the process which generated the analyzed sequences.

maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference 
both bi and ml analyses were run on the high performance computing cluster abel at usit, the university of oslo.

ml
the ml analyses were run in raxml version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the three different datasets all, g <dig> and dt <dig> and the partitioning scheme from partition finder run# <dig> . we used –f a option to perform rapid bootstrap analysis  and search for best scoring ml tree in one program run the gtrcatx model  applied to each partition; the final tree was evaluated under gtrgamma model.

bi
for the purpose of testing model adequacy, we ran mrbayes using the default priors and the following options: ngen = 5 m, samplefreq = 5 k, nchains =  <dig>  and temp =  <dig> .

bayesian phylogenetic inference was performed in mrbayes version  <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  and exabayes version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using all, g <dig> and dt <dig> datasets. both programmes mrbayes and exabayes use similar analytical procedure. exabayes in contrast to mrbayes implements only gtr models and exponential prior for branch length . at the same time, exabayes provides advanced parallelization and computational techniques that significantly speed up computations in comparison to mrbayes.

for the actual phylogenetic analyses, we ran mrbayes with default priors except for the branch length. the default exponential branch length prior is known to cause bias in the branch length estimates in partitioned datasets  <cit> . we used the compound dirichlet prior instead as suggested by  <cit>  and  <cit> . the full description of the analysis set-up is provided in the additional file  <dig> 

in exabayes we ran only unpartitioned analyses under the gtr model to avoid biased estimation of branch length due to the use of exponential branch length prior in partitioned data  <cit> . for each dataset  the two runs in exabayes were ran with default priors and one heated chain  for 100 m generations, sampling parameters every 1000th generation. the two runs converged after 50 m which were discarded as burn in. sdsf between the runs dropped below the acceptable value of 5% being  <dig>  and  <dig>  for g <dig> and dt <dig> dataset respectively.

direct optimization 
for the direct optimization analyses protein coding genes were treated as preealigned while ribosomal genes were split into homologous regions based on amplicon limits and preliminary mafft alignments. this procedure was necessary because many sequences were missing some of the amplicons or had areas with poor quality that were excluded in the process of sequence editing, resulting in length variation that is not due to insertions/deletions. limits of different regions were marked with # and matrices were analyzed under maximum parsimony direct optimization. direct optimization analyses were carried out in the computer program poy v  <dig> .1b  <cit> . we used a search strategy based on iterated timed searches  for 4–6 h as described in  <cit> . the strategy uses a series of timed searches that take, as an input, the best tree from the previous round until results stabilize and further iterations consistently find the same trees. there are large numbers of potential combinations of insertion/deletion, gap extension and substitution costs that can be explored in poy. here we selected a limited number of parameter schemes that have been shown to perform optimally in other studies or have been suggested as best on philosophical grounds. for example the parameter set  <dig> , was suggested as best using philosophical reasoning by j de laet  <cit> . the parameter sets investigated were:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
model adequacy
results from the assessment of model adequacy are summarized in fig.  <dig>  the posterior predictive p-values for the majority of the partitions fall within the 95% confidence interval  indicating that models used to analyze these data adequately capture  the process of their evolution. for this analysis the highest model adequacy corresponds to partitions with p-value approaching  <dig>  whereas the models with extremely high or low values in this two-tailed test should be rejected. interestingly, all rdna genes demonstrate p-values that were not significantly different from our null-model and 18s shows the best performance amongst all markers used in the present study. unreasonable model specifications were found only in some protein-coding genes partitions, with tp <dig> generally showing the worst scores .fig.  <dig> partitions and model adequacy assessment. left graph shows per partition p-values for every gene. the p-values test a null hypothesis that model applied to partition is adequate based on multinomial test statistics in puma . partitions with values within the 95% two-tailed confidence interval are shown with red circles , while those with values outside the tails of the distribution are blue circles . p-value approaching  <dig>  correspond to highest model adequacy. partitions consist of a priori data blocks based on secondary structure , codon position  or codon position and domain structure . in data blocks names the capital letter corresponds to domain  while number indicate codon position. additional information and domain names are given in additional file 6: table s5




phylogenetic analyses
the full and two reduced datasets of at least  <dig> and  <dig> genes  yielded similar topologies and support values but the reduced datasets did not recover some well-corroborated groups found here and in previous studies as they were lacking more than 50% of terminals present in full dataset. given the significance of taxon sample size in assessing global phylogeny, we limit our discussion below only to the datasets based on the full taxon sample.

all datasets  analyzed using ml produced congruent topologies that differed mainly in linkage of intermediate branches . the percentage of shared clades between any two of three datasets was high .fig.  <dig> pairwise comparison of ml trees between analyses with all, g <dig> and dt <dig> dataset. branches that differ between analyses are colored in red

the results from the mrbayes analyses were not satisfactory – standard deviation of split frequencies  was higher the acceptable value of  <dig> . nevertheless, the inferred consensus tree can be, to certain extent, considered stable . poor convergence in mrbayes is known to occur when analyzing big datasets  <cit>  due to ineffective mcmc sampling from the posterior distribution of topologies  <cit> .

despite the bi convergence issues, results from ml and bi analyses were generally also congruent . however, the partitioned bayesian analysis in mrbayes  was more similar to the ml topologies when compared with the unpartitioned analysis from exabayes. because of this higher incongruence and less reasonable partitioning scheme  we do not overview the exabayes results in detail. the partitioned bayesian analysis is also congruent to ml results in terms of support for intermediate branches, many of which are unresolved in the bayesian consensus tree from the partitioned analysis and vary among ml analyses depending on the dataset. at the same time, both ml and bi trees were drastically different from the poy trees . poy yielded trees with many genera and well-supported monophyletic groups appearing as polyphyletic. because results from poy were highly divergent from any other published phylogeny and from ml and bi analyses performed here  we did not continue with further exploration of the results under direct optimization.

since all ml and bi  analyses are similar, for illustration purposes we select the ml analysis of the dt <dig> dataset as a base topology. this is also the dataset with the highest number of inadequate partitions excluded. then, in order to summarize the results from the other two datasets and the congruence among analyses, we mapped the same clades onto the dt <dig> tree . the differences and similarities in major lineages among the analyses are further summarized in a greater detail in additional file 22: table s <dig> 

monophyly of scarabaeinae was supported by all ml and bi analyses. also, all ml analyses recover “basal scarabaeinae” as paraphyletic lineage whose side branch leads to all the remaining scarabaeinae. almost all genera were recovered monophyletic with just a few of them  poly- or para-phyletic depending on the dataset analyzed.

the majority of tribes in their conventional definitions emerge monophyletic except for oniticellini that is nested within onthophagini, and the highly dispersed deltochilini, ateuchini  and coprini. for the latter three tribes new concepts are established .

in our phylogeny, paraphytus and haroldius are placed within the basal scarabaeinae: the most basal taxon paraphytus is sister to sarrophorus-like genera, while haroldius is a sister to byrrhidium + dicranocara + namakwanus clade. african pedaria comes up as sister to copris + litocopris .

the endemic madagascan genera formerly treated as deltochilini split into four lineages that are spread across the tree:  genera apotolamprus + nanos form a separate clade  genus epactoides emerges in the same clade with oriental ochicanthon and afro-madagascan madaphacosoma  arachnodes comes up monophyletic in results of the g <dig> dataset while it is polyphyletic in results based on the dt <dig> dataset and  genus cambefortantus forms a separate lineage; in results from the g <dig> dataset it is sister to the australian boletoscapter.

in ml analyses, all australasian endemic genera except boletoscapter tended to form a paraphyletic lineage with the neotropical genera uroxys + bdelyropsis nested within it.

the neotropical tribe eurysternini is sister to the afro-madagascan-oriental clade formed by the genera madaphacosoma, ochicanthon and epactoides. a large monophyletic group  is composed of taxa with primarily old world origin . it includes the tribes onitini, onthophagini, oniticellini along with the genera xinidium, macroderes, hammondantus and pycnopanelus.

south african deltochiline-like epirinus is recovered as sister to the primarily old world genera neosisyphus and sisiphus traditionally assigned in the tribe sisyphini.

the american tribes phanaeini and eucranini are recovered as monophyletic and sister to the other american genera from the tribe ateuchini/dichotomiini .

the neotropical ateuchini subtribe scatimina  <cit>  splits into two lineages, one includes the genera trichillum, trichillidium and leotrichillum and the other is comprised by scatimus. however, the ml analysis of the all dataset and both bayesian analyses supports sister relationship between scatimus and ateuchus.

only dt <dig> dataset recovered monophyly of genera canthidium, heliocopris and frankebergerius and close relationships between homocopris and ontherus.

some noteworthy groups were not recovered in the dt <dig> and all datasets; however, they were recovered by the ml analyses of the less data restrictive g <dig> dataset. a clade including the neotropical genera tesserodoniella, homocopris, and paracanthon was resolved. the african genus gyronotus appears as a close relative of the african clade anachalcos + canthodimorpha. finally the neotropical canthonella was nested within australasian endemics clade.

discussion
data, model adequacy and partitions
bayesian posterior assessment 
the traditional model selection procedure in phylogenetics focuses on selecting the best model from a set of substitution models using statistical criteria such as aic, bic, bayes factor, etc. however, this procedure does not guarantee that the selected model can be reasonably applied to the data due to factors such as heterogeneous evolutionary rates or selection, which can violate assumptions of the available substitution models. use of substitution models that do not adequately capture the evolutionary processes in the data may in turn result in biased phylogenies. it has been suggested that testing for model adequacy should be an important step in phylogenetic analysis, although it remains poorly explored and rarely implemented  <cit> .

one of the ways to test the model adequacy is to use posterior predictive assessment  in a bayesian framework  <cit> . the bpa applied, in this study  <cit> , uses a sample of parameters from the posterior distribution of the bayesian analyses to simulate molecular datasets and then, assesses the probability of seeing the original dataset in the array of the simulated ones based on the multinomial likelihood test statistics. our results show that not all molecular partitions that we initially designed were adequate in bpa framework . use of such datasets or data partitions with available substitution models  do not adequately capture the process that generated the data and may lead to biased results.

we also show that bpa performance substantially differs between codon and domain position in protein-coding genes. while some parts of these genes can be adequately analyzed with the traditional phylogenetics models, others may have to be excluded from phylogenetic analyses. this finding further stresses the need for choosing an appropriate partitioning scheme and assessment of model adequacy prior to the phylogeny estimation.

all ml and bi analyses produced similar topologies sharing 71–75% of identical clades . the analyses including partitions that performed poorly under the bpa test  did not differ significantly from the results of the dt <dig> dataset that excludes all partitions that did not pass the bpa test. this points to a strong phylogenetic signal in the part of the data where substitution models did perform plausibly.

selecting and testing data using bpa has a statistically solid basis  <cit>  and brings a great potential to improve phylogenetic inference. however the current implementation of this approach to big datasets, as the one used here, is problematic due to the lack of software capable to perform efficient computations on big datasets. the large size of our dataset did not allow implementing bpa analysis in a bayesian framework under partitioned scheme . the alternative program exabayes, that provides high level of parallelization and computational speed, is currently lacking a proper conjugate prior  for tree branch length, which may bias the analyses when using data partitioning. thus, at present, large datasets can be efficiently analyzed only in ml framework using raxml program that uses exclusively gtr model for phylogenetic inference, thereby providing a limited model choice for the inference and bpa procedure.

partition scheme search
in addition to use of bpa as a tool to evaluate data and model performance we also used the program partition finder in order to select optimal partition scheme for the analyses. here we used the program following the manual recommendations, i.e. providing an initial set of partitions and letting the algorithm find the best partitioning scheme. however, we found that this procedure may not necessarily find the best solution . we show that, at least in the present case, it is possible to further improve partition schemes by manually altering the results from partition finder. identification of the reason for this behavior was beyond the scope of this study, although it is presumably due to the use of the greedy algorithm option. therefore, we strongly encourage researchers relying on this algorithm to follow a procedure as the one outlined in the methods section.

dung beetles higher level relationships
trees and analyses
many of the clades supported by the present phylogeny are consistent with previous phylogenetic treatments of dung beetles ; and, the present results are also highly congruent with the global morphological phylogeny  <cit> . this similarity between studies shows that results from different sources tend to converge on an underlying pattern in enlarged datasets. the differences across datasets and ml and bi analyses were insignificant in the context of higher-level relationships. exclusion and inclusion of different partitions had its advantages and disadvantages; some meaningful relationships inferred in the first case were absent in the second and vice versa. this is likely a result of the heterogeneous nature of the evolutionary process that influences the performance of a marker across a given tree. although the excluded partitions are found by the bpa as inflicting potential bias on phylogenetic inference, they can be locally informative, especially in resolving recent divergences. the exclusion of these partitions may result in data deficiency at that level and decreased resolution for shallow nodes.

poy trees show significant differences from ml and bi trees and all other published phylogenies. we hypothesize, that this odd behavior of poy in the present study is probably result of the large portion of missing data , which negatively affects the direct optimization method.

molecules vs. morphology
the position of “basal scarabeinae” with paraphytus, as was initially predicted by morphology  <cit> , is largely congruent with present molecular results. the position of haroldius as sister to byrrhidium + dicranocara + namakwanus within “basal scarabaeinae” is surprising but strongly supported . the phylogenetic affiliations of haroldius have long remained enigmatic: preliminary morphological analysis placed it in onthophagini  <cit> , while other authors placed it within deltochilini  <cit> .

the australasian clade found here is similar to that supported by morphological analysis , although in both cases endemic australasian genera do not form a strictly monophyletic group. interestingly, morphology, unlike molecules, strongly supports australian boletoscapter within australasian clade ; whereas this study recovers neotropical uroxys + bdelyropsys nested within australasian clade. alternatively, another molecular  <cit>  phylogeny suggests sister relationships between uroxys + bdelyropsys and boletoscapter but does not support such australasian clade. african pedaria, having significant morphological similarities was recovered within aus <dig> by morphology  <cit>  and a previous molecular study  <cit> ; however, in the present study it is placed as a sister of coprini sensu novo.

in this study, clade a, comprising some taxa of old world origin, is moderately supported and biogeographically well defined. in morphology, this clade is split into three remotely related lineages . it is noteworthy that morphological analyses  <cit>  did not support a sister or close relationship between onitini and onthophagini + oniticellini, which is recovered by molecular phylogenies  including the present study. a lack of synapomorphies that would support this grouping in the morphological dataset is likely the cause for this incongruence.

madagascan apotolamprus and arachnodes form a clade in the morphological phylogeny  due to their significant similarities; however, in the present study they appear to not be closely related, which confirms the results of other molecular study  <cit> .

the relationship between the ateuchini type genus ateuchus and the ateuchini subtribe scatimina varies depending on the dataset. the present molecular data suggests that the subtribe scatimina may be polyphyletic as it is split into two groups trichillum + allied genera and scatimus. scatimus shows close relationship to ateuchus but that is not the case for the clade including trichillum + allied genera. this contradicts two morphological phylogenies  <cit> , which recover the monophyly of ateuchus + scatimina, although it is supported only by one homoplastic synapomorphy – presence of trochantofemoral pit  <cit> .

the present results along with previous morphological  <cit>  and molecular  <cit>  studies support the position of deltochiline-like epirinus within the tribe sisyphini. based on these results, here we place epirinus in the tribe sisyphini sensu novo. further arguments for that decision are provided in the "changes in classification" section below.

the congruence between results from previous molecular analyses , recent morphological analysis  <cit>  and the molecular analysis presented here for the tribes deltochilini, ateuchini and coprini as well as the high support for the sister relationships between epirinus and sisyphini motivated us to reevaluate the limits of these tribes.

new tribal concepts and perspectives for new classification
natural tribal classification for dung beetles is essential to study their diversity, ecology and evolution. strong polyphyly of some historic tribes found in the present analyses and in previous phylogenies  indicates that the tribal classification as currently defined does not reflect natural units and has to be revised.

systematic classification must fulfill two main purposes  classify the diversity under study into monophyletic units reflecting their evolutionary history and  provide characters that allow unambiguous diagnosability of all included taxa. given that requirements for monophyly and diagnosability must be fulfilled, splitting a phylogenetic tree into groups  is a somewhat subjective procedure – groups can be defined at shallower nodes producing many monophyletic lineages with few terminal taxa or at deeper nodes resulting in fewer groups that include more terminal taxa. in order to comply with the aforementioned classification purposes, the scarabaeine tribes seem to be better defined at more terminal nodes resulting in a somewhat larger number of tribes. at that level molecular and morphological phylogenies are largely congruent and clades are defined by large numbers of synapomorphies. these two properties guarantee well-supported monophyly and efficient identification for the resulting groups. contrary to that, defining groups at deeper nodes would yield fewer poorly corroborated tribes that are hard to diagnose, because at this level nodes are often supported by single homoplastic synapomorphy. thus, splitting and not lumping seems to be an efficient way for the development of a new higher level dung beetle classification due to the lack of diagnosability at deeper nodes. although, in our results some intermediate nodes are still poorly supported, they are irrelevant for the development of new classification as they lack diagnosability in the context of morphology.

traditional concepts  <cit>  for the tribes deltochilini, ateuchini  and coprini render them largely polyphyletic. the results presented here and in the recent morphological phylogeny  <cit>  are consistent in supporting the monophyly of the clades that contain the type genera of those tribes  and their close relatives providing a solid basis for the revision of these tribal concepts . moreover, global morphological analysis  <cit>  identified synapomorphies that allow easy identification and diagnosis of these revised tribes. until now identification of many dung beetle tribes has been practically impossible because traditional concepts were not based on synapomorphies or diagnostic characters but rather used authors’ intuition and overall habitus similarity. explicit concepts and clear characters defining the revised tribal definitions presented here contribute to the stability of the dung beetle classification. however, at the same time they leave  <dig> genera, previously placed in ateuchini , deltochilini and coprini, without tribal affiliation . many of these incertae sedis genera cannot be placed easily in other existing tribes  and it is possible that new taxa will have to be defined in order to accommodate them.

we also propose to expand the concept for the tribe sisyphini. sisyphini traditionally comprised only three genera. both molecular and morphological analyses support sister relationship between the traditional sisyphini genera and the south african genus epirinus that was formerly placed within the tribe deltochilini. monophyly of this new group is supported by three synapomorphies and by high bootstrap and posterior probability in the corresponding analyses. based on this evidence we propose to transfer epirinus in sisyphini.

changes in classification
tribal concepts
the new limits  for tribes proposed here are based on the present results and are also supported by the findings from several recent molecular phylogenetic analyses  and on the global morphological phylogeny  <cit> . the traditional concepts for the tribe dichotomiini, deltochilini , coprini and sisyphini follow  <cit> . list of genera included in the new concept of each tribe  is given in table  <dig>  the family-group names follow  <cit> . the concepts sensu novo for the tribes deltochilini and dichotomiini correspond to their concepts sensu stricto in  <cit> . the redifined tribes emerged monophyletic in all the analyses presented here and are also suppotreted by previous phylgoentic work ; their support values are provided in table  <dig> 

in this study, unlike  <cit> , we consider dichotomiini and ateuchini to be different tribes . our new concept for dichotomiini introduces changes in the composition of genera in ateuchini. the list of putative ateuchini genera is given in additional file 23: table s <dig>  the genera, which are, excluded form the revised tribes and treated as incertae sedis are also listed in the additional file 23: table s <dig>

diagnostic characters  were elucidated using the character matrix of  <cit>  by finding a unique combination of characters providing unequivocal diagnosis for the new concepts. since coprini sensu novo is not strictly monophyletic in  <cit>  , its synapomorphies could not be assessed. sisyphini sensu novo is characterized by both synapomorphies and one diagnostic character. we should note that diagnostic character might also be ambiguous synapomorphies.

because the morphological phylogeny  <cit>  includes only 37% of the global scarabaeine generic diversity, we manually investigated the presence of the potential diagnostic characters and putative synapomorphies in ~90% of all scarabaeinae genera hitherto placed in deltochilini, dichotomiini and coprini .table  <dig> new tribal concepts and their genera

tribe coprini sensu novo
coprini leach 1815:  <dig> 

type genus: copris geoffroy, 1762

systematic note
part of the genera of coprini sensu novo  are monophyletic in the present molecular phylogeny. the global morphological phylogeny  <cit>  reveals a polytomy of copris with pseudopedaria + micorcopris . the lack of resolution in coprini sensu novo in morphology is the probable result of incomplete species sample from this tribe. it is noteworthy that genus microcopris is considered by some authors  <cit>  as a subgenus of copris pointing out to their close relationship. in spite of lack of resolution, the present molecular results generally corroborate the morphological finding providing further evidence for the monophyly of coprini sensu novo. however, more data are desirable to improve the support for this group.

in the present study coprini sensu novo is well supported by ml and bi ; previous studies also suggest a separate monophyletic position for the members of coprini sensu novo  <cit> . coprini sensu novo comprises five genera , all of which were members of the traditionally defined coprini. we confidently place catharsius, metacatharsius, coptodactyla, previously considered coprini, outside coprini sensu novo as neither molecules nor morphology support this placement. we transfer a few other coprini genera thyregis, synapsis, copridaspidus not included in present analyses to incertae sedis based on another morphological phylogeny  <cit>  suggesting their sister relationships to the non-coprini sensu novo genera coptodactyla, heliocopris and catharsius correspondingly. all genera transferred to the incertae sedis category are listed in additional file 23: table s <dig> table  <dig> the support for the new tribal concepts in scarabaeinae

diagnosis and synapomorphies
the lack of resolution in morphology makes identification of synapomorphies difficult for this tribe; therefore, here we provide only diagnostic characters aiding efficient identification of coprini sensu novo. the tribe can be unequivocally differentiated by combination of two character states :  apical area of wing bearing sclerite located posteriorly of rp <dig> and  absent pre-epipleural  elytral carina. in addition, species of coprini sensu novo also share the following combination of character states:  srp simple not ring-shaped,  elytron with  <dig> distinctly visible striae and  anterior ridge of hypomera stretches toward lateral margin of hypomera. the majority of genera, , have hypomera with posterior longitudinal ridge; however, this character is present in other non-coprini sensu novo genera as well .

distribution
all five genera of coprini sensu novo genera are primarily distributed in the afrotropical and oriental regions. some species of the type genus copris are also found in north and central america.

tribe deltochilini  sensu novo
deltochilini lacordaire 1856:  <dig> 

canthonini van lansberge 1874:  <dig> 

scatonomini lacordaire 1856:  <dig> 

type genus: deltochilum eschscholtz, 1822

systematic note
the traditional concept of the tribe deltochilini  comprising 100+ genera was recovered highly polyphyletic by our results and previous studies  <cit> . deltochilini as traditionally defined form numerous monophyletic groups spread across the phylogenetic tree of scarabaeinae. both molecular results presented here  and morphological results  <cit>  recover the monophyletic group of true deltochilini  comprising the type genus of the tribe and allies, all of which exclusively occur in the new world. morphological phylogeny recovered  <dig>  while present molecular phylogeny recovered  <dig> genera in the clade deltochilini sensu novo,  <dig> of those genera were shared between the two phylogenies .

diagnosis and synapomorphies
the morphological phylogeny suggests two unique and easily identifiable synapomorphies in wing venation  characterizing the diagnosis of this new tribal concept. investigation of morphology in genera traditionally assigned to deltochilini and dichotomiini allowed us to identify additional  <dig> genera that share the same synapomorphies with deltochilini sensu novo. based on this finding we assign these genera to the deltochilini sensu novo. beside those unique synapomorphies the general morphology of those  <dig> genera is similar to that of the genera included in our phylogenetic analyses. as a result, the new definition of deltochilini limits its traditional concept by leaving only  <dig> genera out of 100+ within that tribe .

distribution
the majority of genera are distributed in the neotropics, while some also occur in the nearctic region. numerous other genera traditionally placed in deltochilini from new world, all from afrotropics, oriental and australasian regions do not belong to deltochilini sensu novo nor to any other known tribe given the results of aforementioned phylogenies; herein we treat them as incertae sedis .

tribe dichotomiini sensu novo and the case of ateuchini

dichotomiini pereira 1954:55

dichotomides halffter 1961:228

dichotomiini halffter and matthews 1966: 256

type genus: dichotomius hope,  <dig> 

systematic note
the name dichotomiini has been hitherto considered unavailable as a family-group name due to the lack of description or validation  <cit>  but nevertheless was widely used in scarabaeinae. thanks to our colleague  who gave a hint to previously overlooked publication  <cit> , the name dichotomiini has to be deemed available. according to the international code of zoological nomenclature article  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  “a family-group name first published after  <dig> and before  <dig> … is available from its original publication only if it was used as valid before  <dig> …”. the name dichotomiini after its original publication in  <dig>  <cit>  was subsequently used before  <dig>  which given the aforementioned article confirms its availability.

tribe dichotomiini has been considered a junior synonym of ateuchini  <cit>  as the genus dichotomius was deemed to be closely related to ateuchus . morphological phylogeny recovers that ateuchus and allies  are remotely related to dichotomius lineage. present molecular result recovers polyphyly of ateuchini and suggests sister group relationship between dichotomius and ateuchus + scatimus, while other representatives of ateuchini subtribe scatimina emerge as more remotely related. although, molecular results support the monophyly of dichotomius + ateuchus, morphological analyses unequivocally point to their significant morphological divergence. in order to fulfill abovementioned classification principles, it is therefore convenient to separate dichotomius + allies and ateuchus + allies into two tribes. the main objective for following the splitting principle is to create the diagnosable groups. thus, we split the tribe ateuchini into two tribes ateuchini and dichotomiini sensu novo. in the present study dichotomiini sensu novo is well supported by ml and bi . the name ateuchini has now to be applied only to the members of the genus ateuchus and its close relatives . the tentative list comprising  <dig> ateuchini genera is given in additional file 23: table s9; however, the exact composition and diagnosis of this tribe requires additional investigation. the genera transferred from the traditional concept of dichotomiini to incertae sedis category are also listed in additional file 23: table s <dig> 

diagnosis and synapomorphies
the monophyly of dichotomiini sensu novo is well supported by molecules  <cit>  as well as morphology  <cit> . based on recent morphological analyses  <cit>  dichotomiini sensu novo is defined by  <dig> unique and  <dig> homoplasious synapomorphies  which unequivocally diagnose this tribe.

distribution
dichotomiini sensu novo comprises four genera  widespread in the neotropics, of which dichotomius is distributed in both nearctic and neotropical regions.

tribe sisyphini sensu novo
sisyphini mulsant 1842:  <dig> 

type genus: sisyphus latreille, 1807

systematic note
genus epirinus is found to be sister to the traditional sisyphini genera sisyphus and neosisyphus. present and previous  <cit>  molecular as well as morphological  <cit>  results strongly support this relationship, which suggests the transfer of epirinus to sisyphini. in present study sisyphini sensu novo is well supported by ml and bi .

diagnosis and synapomorphies
the diagnosis of expanded sisyphini sensu novo is defined by two unique and one homoplasious synapomorphies .

distribution
sisyphini sensu novo comprises four genera, two of which sisyphus and neosisyphus primarily occur in the afrotropical and oriental regions, some species of sisyphus are also distributed in the palearctic and the neotropics. the distribution of the genus neosisyphus is restricted to mauritius island, while epirinus occurs in southern africa.

CONCLUSIONS
the present molecular phylogeny advances our knowledge on dung beetle relationships. we used these results in conjunction with the recent morphological phylogeny and evidences from molecular phylogenies that have been accumulated over the last decades to revise the concepts of three of the subfamily’s most problematic tribes . although the result of the new classification proposed here leaves many dung beetle genera unclassified , it creates a systematically based classification for the existing tribes and provides a clear direction for future work with these genera. at the same time deep relationships within the subfamily remain poorly supported pointing to the need of acquisition of additional data to resolve them. these issues have to be addressed by future studies aiming at integration of molecular, morphological and fossil data.

we propose that use of modern statistical methods for model adequacy evaluation has a potential to improve phylogenetic inference by detecting cases where substitution models do not perform well. presently, data selection using this approach cannot be fully performed on big datasets due to computational constraints. the development of new software packages is needed to overcome this problem. at the same time it is noteworthy that inclusion of data where models do not adequately depict substitution process according to our analysis, did not substantially affect the final phylogenetic analyses. likely the presence of strong signal in our dataset from large portions where the application of substitution models is plausible has compensated for the potential biases caused by the inclusion of partitions that were rejected in the adequacy assessments.
