BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men in the united states. despite decades of research, there are no effective treatment options available for the advanced stages of the disease. while androgen ablation therapy is a standard first-line treatment, the vast majority of prostate tumors eventually become hormone refractory and continue to proliferate even with very low levels of androgen. this stage, often referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer , is associated with an active androgen receptor -signaling pathway. chen et al. reported that in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts derived from metastatic lesions, ar over-expression is necessary and sufficient to render the cells resistant to androgen withdrawal and antiandrogens  <cit> . the observation is further supported in the clinical setting where ar is frequently over-expressed in crpc with ar amplification in up to 30% of those tumors  <cit> .

ar, a member of the nuclear receptor  superfamily, functions mainly as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. upon binding of the androgenic hormone testosterone or its more active analog dihydrotestosterone  in the cytoplasm, ar translocates into the nucleus to bind dna and regulate gene expression. ar has a wide range of regulatory roles in prostate growth and function, including but not limited to cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and secretory activity  <cit> . while many of its direct activation targets have been characterized, the key downstream effectors, especially those playing a role in carcinogenesis or modulated during targeted therapy, remain to be determined; even less is known about the genes directly repressed by ar  <cit> , though they may also be important contributors to ar function in disease and treatment settings.

currently approved drugs aimed at androgen signaling axis include the ar antagonist bicalutamide and the cyp <dig> inhibitor abiraterone  <cit> . given the critical role of ar in prostate cancer progression and particularly the late stages of the disease, additional therapeutic approaches are under development to target the receptor. preclinical strategies involve double-stranded rna interference, microinjection of anti-ar antibodies, and antisense oligonucleotides  <cit> . the most advanced agents in clinical testing are second-generation small molecule antagonists of ar function such as the diarylthiohydantoin mdv <dig>  which reduces the efficiency of ar nuclear translocation and impairs both dna binding and recruitment of coactivators  <cit> .

recent advances in high throughput technologies such as chip-chip and chip-seq have enabled genome-wide identification of the ar cistrome in a number of preclinical models of prostate cancer  <cit> . while these studies provided novel insights into ar biology and gene regulatory networks, some important questions remain to be answered. in particular, the genomic landscape of ar binding has not been published in the presence of pharmacological agents, which are key to understanding the molecular activity of ar therapeutics. furthermore, neither the core set of direct effector targets upon which ar’s binding and transcriptional activities are modulated by inhibitor drugs nor the oncogenic pathways they represent have been identified.

in this work, we employ chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing  to provide the first publicly available genome-wide and dose-dependent inhibition map of ar binding by small molecules. by integrating sequence analysis, transcriptome profiling, cell viability assays and xenograft tumor growth inhibition studies, we explore the ar cistrome-activity relationship to render a global and dynamic view of its regulatory program upon small molecule antagonism. we also investigate endogenous and wild type ar binding at low androgen levels, a scenario that mimics prostate cancer patients following first-line androgen ablation therapy. collectively, our study offers molecular insights into the pathological role of ar in crpc progression and therapeutic-like contexts.

RESULTS
a spectrum of genome-wide ar binding in vcap cells
to create high-resolution, global maps of the interactions between dna and androgen receptor, we profiled the vcap cell line, which was derived from a vertebrate metastasis of a 59 year old male with crpc. with high levels of endogenous wild type ar and tmprss2-erg fusions as well as expression of many prostate epithelial markers, these cells serve as a useful model for crpc tumor progression and metastasis  <cit> . vcap cells were grown in the presence  or absence  of the synthetic ar agonist metribolone  to characterize ar binding in high and low androgen conditions respectively. cross-linked chromatin from vcap cells was immunoprecipitated with an antibody  highly specific for ar, which recognized a single major band at 110 kb on western blot and the same band was reduced by ar-sirna treatment . dna pull-downs were then purified, amplified and sequenced with the illumina genome analyzer  <dig>  resulting in approximately  <dig> million single-end reads from each sample, which were then mapped to the most recent version of the human genome  with the eland algorithm.

using model-based analysis of chip-seq   <cit> , we identified  <dig> and  <dig> ar binding sites for r <dig> and r <dig> samples respectively. for subsequent analyses, we focused on the  <dig> and  <dig> high-confidence sites , which had higher statistical significance than any of the “negative” peaks obtained by swapping the chip-seq and control channels. the ar binding at all twelve tested regions was more than 3-fold above negative control by quantitative pcr analysis , suggesting that the sites identified by chip-seq represent bona fide ar binding. additionally, the macs binding  score was concordant  with the enrichment values from qpcr.

 <dig> ar binding sites identified from chip-seq were tested for enrichment by real-time quantitative pcr. reactions were carried out in triplicate. negative control refers to a non-enriched region .

as functional elements tend to be evolutionarily conserved, we examined the multiple alignments of  <dig> vertebrate genomes to the human genome by sampling phastcons conservation score  <cit>  every 100 bp. ar sites were most conserved at their binding summit and quickly dropped down to near genomic background level within 300 bp of either side of the summit , underscoring the high resolution of chip-seq technology as well as the accuracy of summit position calls by the macs algorithm. importantly, ar binding sites identified from r <dig> sample were no less conserved than those from r <dig> sample , revealing that even with low levels of androgen, ar binding is far from random and likely occupies functional sites.

when ar binding sites were mapped to genomic annotations, they appeared only moderately associated with proximal promoters, with approximately  <dig> fold over-representation compared to genomic background . this is consistent with previous reports that ar often acts through distal enhancer elements  <cit> . unbiased signature analysis showed that ar-bound genes were most significantly enriched with those transcriptionally regulated by the androgen receptor signaling pathway from mrna profiling studies : depending on the exact expression signature, between 40% and 63% of the genes in the signature had high-confidence ar binding within 25 kb of their transcription start sites , whereas only 23% were expected.

we next performed a comparative analysis of ar binding in low and high androgen conditions. strikingly, with more than 99% of ar binding sites identified in the absence of r <dig> stimuli also bound in its presence , the r <dig> binding sites appeared to be a near-perfect subset of r <dig> ones. furthermore, the common binding sites were significantly biased towards those with higher binding score . together, our findings reveal that even in low androgen level situations, such as those characteristic of androgen ablation treatment, ar is still functional by selectively occupying the strongest binding sites.

ar binding and cell type
to investigate the role of cell type in ar binding, we compared sites identified in vcap with those from other pre-clinical models of prostate cancer  <cit> . vcap and lncap  cells share more than 60% of their ar binding sites regardless of the technology platform  used for profiling . interestingly, the overlap was even more extensive for those also occupied in the absence of r <dig> stimuli , implying that “baseline” ar binding tends to be preferentially conserved across cell types.

by contrast, ar binding in vcap and pc3-ar cells were highly discordant and had only  <dig> sites in common, corresponding to  <dig> % of total vcap and  <dig> % of total pc3-ar sites. furthermore, we didn’t observe a significant enrichment of overlap for the r <dig> subset . as both datasets were collected using chip-seq, this sharp divergence is more likely biological than technical: pc <dig> cells do not express androgen receptor endogenously and its ar binding was profiled following transfection of an ar construct  <cit> . unlike the binding pattern in endogenous ar-expressing vcap and lncap cells, the ar binding sites in pc3-ar cells were reported to be predominantly in the proximal vicinity of tss and to lack androgen response elements   <cit> . these differences underscore the important role that biological and experimental context plays in transcription factor binding and function.

dna cis-regulatory element associated with ar binding
a systematic search of known transcription factor binding motifs curated by the genomatix matbase database  identified cis-regulatory elements for the gref  family to be most enriched among ar-bound sequences , with 85% containing at least one copy of the motifs  and r <dig> samples respectively). the gref family includes the androgen receptor and the closely related glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and progesterone receptors  <cit> . fkhd  motifs were the second most over-represented family, consistent with previous reports  <cit>  as well as its proposed role as a pioneer factor for ar  <cit> . interestingly, neighboring gref and fkhd elements  had a clear distance preference at 15 bp , indicating a likely geometric constraint resulting from their interaction.

cis-regulatory elements for many other ar interacting factors, such as gata, hnf <dig>  and nf1f , were also highly over-represented . additionally, ar binding sites were enriched with sequence motifs recognized by the abdb  family , suggesting potential combinatorial control between androgen receptor and homeobox genes. hoxb <dig> has recently been reported to regulate the cellular response to androgens  <cit>  as well as co-localize with ar to suppress androgen-stimulated psa expression  <cit> , while hoxc <dig> appears to negatively regulate ar signaling in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting src- <dig> recruitment to direct androgen target genes  <cit> .

ab initio motif discovery with the meme algorithm  <cit>  identified a perfectly palindromic 15 bp motif , supporting the observation that ar interacts with dna as dimers  <cit> . it was highly specific to the ar-bound sequences  and strongly resembled the androgen response element  described previously  <cit> . furthermore, ar sites with this motif were stronger than those without , underscoring its role in determining ar binding.

small molecule inhibitors of ar function
after conducting an extensive structure-activity relationship  study using a crpc cell-based high throughput screening, we identified two novel potent ar antagonists   <cit> . importantly, these aryloxy tetramethylcyclobutane compounds had no agonist effect up to 10 μm concentration while effectively inhibiting ar translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus . molecular modeling suggested that these compounds with relatively bulky substituents at the amide likely extend between asn <dig> and thr <dig> and force the critical helix  <dig> of the ar ligand-binding domain  into a disrupted “open” conformation, thereby leading to ar full antagonism  <cit> .

for agonism, values obtained from the ar antagonist compounds were compared to those of untreated cells, which were assigned an arbitrary number of  <dig>  to indicate no agonism. for antagonism, cells were treated with  <dig> nm r <dig> alone  or in combination with the antagonist compounds at various doses to determine ic <dig> values. nuclear translocation and cell proliferation values were calculated as indicated under materials and methods.

to confirm that ar is de facto the protein target of these compounds, we compared the mrna profiles of vcap cells treated with compound  <dig> and those treated with ar-sirna using the affymetrix hg-u133plus <dig>  genechip array. differential expression analysis was conducted with significance analysis of microarray  algorithm  <cit> . the genome-wide pearson correlation was  <dig>  for fold changes and  <dig>  for sam d-scores , indicating a high degree of concordance between the two types of treatments. there was also striking overlap in significantly differentially expressed genes . thus, the small molecule antagonist induces similar global transcriptional effects as ar inhibition by sirna.

interestingly, the mrna level of the androgen receptor itself was notably higher in compound-treated cells compared to vehicle control across all four probesets for the gene on microarray , suggesting that the cells respond to loss of ar by increasing its gene expression in a positive feedback loop. the microarray-based observation was further supported by rt-pcr measurements of ar expression in tumors derived from the vcap cells implanted in mice , in sharp contrast to sirna-treated cells where ar mrna level was significantly reduced .

effects on cell viability and tumor growth inhibition
to determine the impact and specificity of ar antagonist treatment on prostate cancer growth, we first assessed the effect of compound  <dig> and  <dig> on cell viability using various pre-clinical models, including ar-positive vcap cells and ar-negative du <dig> and pc <dig> cells. proliferation of cells treated in culture for up to seven days in the presence of these small molecule antagonists was significantly inhibited in vcap compared to vehicle control, but was not significantly affected in those cells which do not express ar , demonstrating that the antiproliferative effects elicited by the antagonist compounds were ar specific. nevertheless, the behavior of the two compounds differed in vcap cells: while compound  <dig> dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, compound 26’s impact plateaued at the highest concentration tested .

a genome-wide inhibition map of ar binding by small molecules
finally, we profiled the ar cistrome in the presence of compounds  <dig> and  <dig> at three different doses,  <dig>  μm, 1 μm and 10 μm. addition of the inhibitors reduced the number of ar binding sites compared to those of r <dig> sample untreated by antagonist . consistent with their anti-proliferative behavior , compound  <dig> had a strong dose-dependent effect on ar binding while compound 26’s impact saturated at 10 μm , providing a direct molecular basis for deciphering the activity of these small molecule-based ar therapeutics.

to quantify the molecular effects of the two antagonists, we defined “maximum” and “minimum” ar binding using r <dig> and r <dig> cistromes in the absence of drug treatment respectively. the percent  impact measure was based on their differentially occupied sites. strikingly, at 10 μm, compound  <dig> achieved a 99% impact, reducing ar binding essentially from maximum to minimum level  with a binding pattern similar to that of r <dig> . when sorted by their macs binding score, a clear trend emerged that weaker sites were disrupted at lower dose  and experienced greater changes . furthermore, the binding sites still occupied in the presence of the ar antagonists tend to have higher quality sequence motif of the 15 bp perfect palindrome that we identified . to address the possibility that these patterns could arise because weaker binding sites are more prone to false positives, we included eleven sites from the lower half of the binding score spectrum for quantitative pcr analysis and they were all validated .

the ar-antagonists were also evaluated for their in vivo efficacy in castrated vcap tumor-bearing-cb17/lcr-prkdc scid mice treated with 25 mg/kg of compound  <dig> and 100 mg/kg of compound  <dig> daily by oral gavage. the compound doses were chosen to achieve average plasma exposure at least 10-fold higher than the target potency of the compounds . as shown in figure 4b, both ar antagonists effectively inhibited tumor growth and reduced psa levels throughout the study .

a core set of direct downstream effectors modulated by ar antagonism
to obtain a multi-layer mechanistic understanding of the action of these ar modulators, we investigated the coupled expression change of those genes whose associated ar binding were impacted upon compound  <dig> treatment. notably, not only a significant number of them were down-regulated  but also many were up-regulated  in mrna level upon small molecule antagonism, indicating that the compound influences direct ar targets from both modes of regulation. our integrative analysis of cistrome and transcriptome data identified  <dig> direct activation targets and  <dig> direct repression targets of ar modulated by the drug-like compound respectively . although often overshadowed by its activation targets, the large number of direct repression targets suggests that androgen receptor also has a major role in negative gene regulation, which likely makes important contributions to its oncogenic mechanisms as well as the activities of targeted therapies. in fact, ar binding sites associated with direct repression targets were no less and even slightly more conserved than those associated with activation targets , underscoring their functional relevance. systematic pathway mapping of drug-modulated direct ar target genes revealed that activation targets were over-represented in cell cycle, dna replication, and steroids biosynthesis pathways, whereas repression targets were over-represented by those involved in hypoxia response, mtor signaling and sulfur metabolism .

the direct activation targets of ar impacted upon antagonism include many members of its own nuclear receptor  family  such as nrob <dig> , nr2f <dig>  and thrb, revealing extensive crosstalk and potential hierarchical topology within the nr network. dax <dig> has been reported to inhibit ar function  <cit>  and there is a high-confidence physical interaction between the two proteins  <cit> . dax <dig> is also known as a negative regulator of many genes in the steroid biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . together, they suggest a feedback loop where an ar-dax <dig> protein-protein interaction may serve to sense and prevent the over-production of dax <dig> by ar while ar and dax <dig> counter-balance each other’s effect on steroid synthesis .

emerging clinical data suggest that  prostate tumors have increased expression of enzymes involved in steroid synthesis and lower levels of androgen inactivating enzymes compared to normal tissue  <cit> . as steroids are often inactivated by sulfation  <cit> , our finding of direct regulatory links from ar to steroidogenesis and sulfur metabolism not only provides a mechanism underlying the observed gene expression changes in patient samples but also suggests an important new dimension to ar’s pathological function in crpc. the down-regulation of steroid biosynthesis and up-regulation of sulfur metabolism by small molecule antagonists observed in this study suggests that these oncogenic activities of the androgen receptor can be relieved by targeted small molecule agents and may contribute to their therapeutic benefit in the clinic.

interestingly, we observed a significant enrichment of the drug-modulated direct ar-activation targets among genes with higher expression in er- breast tumors, while conversely, the direct ar-repression targets were significantly enriched among genes with higher expression in er + breast tumors . furthermore, estrogen response elements were disproportionately distributed towards binding sites near direct repression targets of ar compared to their activation counterparts . these point to a potential negative functional relationship between androgen and estrogen  receptors, where er/err may mediate ar’s function in transcriptional repression.

discussion
androgen receptor is a central player throughout development of prostate cancer, even after androgen deprivation therapy  <cit> . by comparing wild-type ar binding in the absence and presence of its ligand agonist metribolone, we found that ar bound to regulatory dna elements even when androgen levels were low via selective occupancy of the strongest binding sites , offering molecular evidence for active ar signaling in crpc tumors  <cit> . it complements other reported mechanisms for persistent ar signaling including receptor amplification or mutation  <cit> , intratumoral conversion of weak adrenal androgens  <cit>  and de novo steroid synthesis from cholesterol  <cit> .

previously published chip-seq studies for androgen receptor  <cit>  have focused on its binding in the absence of pharmacological intervention. here, we characterize the dose-dependent effects of inhibition by drug-like small molecules on genome-wide ar binding: insights from this landscape can support the development of ar therapeutics because it provides a molecular basis for deciphering their pre-clinical and clinical activities. both compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  are potent ar antagonists that also inhibit ar’s translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus . interestingly, their molecular effects on the ar cistrome  were consistent with corresponding phenotypic anti-proliferative behavior , indicating a direct cistrome-activity relationship for these ar antagonists. weaker sites or those with lower quality sequence motif of the 15 bp perfect palindrome appeared preferentially and more impacted . weaker transcription factor binding not only occurs abundantly in vivo but may also be functionally important features of the genomic regulatory program as revealed by evolutionary and gene expression analyses  <cit> . our observations here further suggest that they may also be relevant in a therapeutic context and underscore the need to look beyond the strongest binding sites.

given that our drug-like inhibitors act exclusively as ar antagonists, we not only identified a core set of direct downstream effector genes for androgen receptor by integrating cistrome and transcriptome profiling data upon compound treatment, but also characterized their associated mode of regulation . importantly, these are candidate mediators in a therapeutic setting since both ar’s binding and transcriptional activities at these loci were modulated by small-molecule antagonists. unbiased pathway mapping further revealed ar as a key regulator of steroidogenesis . emerging data indicates that prostate tumor cells are capable of synthesizing their own androgens to sustain growth  <cit> : for instance, the expression of enzymes involved in de novo steroid synthesis has been reported to be up-regulated in both  prostate tumors  <cit>  and crpc patients after cyp17a <dig> inhibitor treatment  <cit> . we found ar directly regulates several key players , a novel oncogenic mechanism that would be relieved by antagonist treatment. thus our result supports the recently proposed combination therapy strategy of treating with cyp17a <dig> and ar inhibitors in a concurrent or sequential manner  <cit> .

ar also appears to directly and positively modulate the expression of its own nuclear receptor family : the most notable is nrob <dig> , an orphan nuclear receptor and a global regulator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/gonadal axis  ontogenesis and steroidogenesis  <cit> . dax <dig> inhibits the activity of steoidogenic factor  by directly binding to its own promoter, preventing sf- <dig> mediated transcription and hence interfering with hormone synthesis  <cit> . dax- <dig> also prevents ligand-activated ar from being imported into the nucleus via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mechanism. together with our observations above, ar and dax <dig> appear to form a tightly controlled feedback loop in controlling steroid biosynthesis . to add to the complexity of the ar-dax1-steroidogenesis network, it has also been reported that the dax <dig> promoter has a redundant region that creates a binding site for sf- <dig> and nr2f <dig>   <cit> , the latter of which is another nr member identified as a direct ar activation target in our current study .

the drug-impacted direct repression targets of ar were significantly enriched with those related to sulfur metabolism  such as sult2b <dig> and papss <dig> . sult2b <dig> is involved in sulfation of the steroids dehydroepiandrosterone  and delta-androstenediol  to prevent their conversion to more potent androgens/estrogens, and its inhibition leads to increased cell proliferation  <cit> . papss <dig> is an enzyme essential to synthesize activated sulfate donor , a cofactor that inactivates steroid hormones through sulfation  <cit> . also directly repressed by ar is acox <dig> , a branched-chain acyl-coa oxidase enzyme that takes part in the degradation of long branched fatty acid and bile acid intermediates in peroxisomes and is down-regulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer  <cit> . these observations are particularly interesting given the clinical data that metastatic prostate cancer express lower levels of androgen inactivating enzymes  <cit>  and complement the result described above that ar positively regulates the expression of many genes involved in biosynthesis of steroids.

we found an inverse functional relationship between androgen and estrogen  receptors in vcap cells, with er/err likely contributing to ar’s role as a transcriptional repressor . whereas ar has recently been reported to inhibit er  <cit> , our study reveals a novel reciprocal effect, providing further support for crosstalk and counter-balance between the two families of sex steroid hormone receptors. it remains to be determined whether er/err contributes to ar repression by direct competition for dna binding or through interaction with its cofactors. in addition to the well-established association of ers with breast cancer, emerging data suggest that they also play important roles in prostate cancer. for instance, erβ, localized in prostate epithelial cells together with ar and dax <dig>  is pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory and impedes prostate cancer emt  <cit> . erβ agonists were shown to activate apoptosis through tumor necrosis factor-α  signaling and target cells that are resistant to systemic androgen deprivation  <cit> . additionally, the closely related orphan nuclear receptor errβ has been reported to be down-regulated in prostate cancer cells and carcinoma lesions and it performs as a tumor suppressor  <cit> . while stable errβ expression suppressed in vivo prostate tumor growth, treatment with an err agonist potentiated errβ-induced growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells. lately the many similarities between breast and prostate cancer have become widely appreciated  <cit> , leading to important therapeutic implications, such as a phase ii clinical trial that is currently underway to investigate the potential benefit of targeting ar in triple negative breast cancer  <cit> .

our observation that the expression of the drug target itself  was significantly up-regulated upon small molecule antagonism  points to an interesting feedback loop of how cells react to ar inhibition. this pattern appears to be a recurrent theme in molecular drug responses: for example, very recently it was reported that cyp17a <dig> level was markedly increased in tumor biopsies from crpc patients after cyp17a <dig> inhibitor therapy  <cit> . further characterization of this control structure, especially in terms of network properties, may elucidate a general mechanism underlying antagonist drug response and associated clinical outcome.

CONCLUSIONS
our study charts the dose-dependent effects of small-molecule antagonists on the genomic landscape of ar binding and elucidates their relationship with phenotypic and transcriptional activities. these novel insights into modulation of the ar regulatory program upon therapeutic antagonism provide a molecular platform for deciphering and developing next generation of pharmacological agents targeting the androgen receptor.
