BACKGROUND
two component regulatory systems  comprise a sensor histidine kinase  and a response regulator , which sense and respond to various environmental conditions, thus promoting bacterial survival  <cit> . upon detection of a specific stimulus, the hk autophosphorylates and transfers a phosphoryl group to the cognate rr, which promotes dna binding of the latter to initiate transcription of the appropriate adaptive response  <cit> . however, under certain circumstances, bacterial rr may also be phosphorylated by a noncognate hk or small molecule acetyl phosphate, merging different stimuli or diversifying the response to a single signal  <cit> , or may function without being phosphorylated  <cit> .

twelve complete pairs of 2crs and a few orphan hk and rr genes have been found in the mycobacterium tuberculosis  genome. senx3-regx <dig> was among the first 2crs to be identified in mtb  <cit> . the senx3-regx <dig> operon is required for mtb survival during murine infection  <cit> . however, conflicting results have been reported for the virulence of strains deficient in senx <dig> or regx <dig> in the lungs and spleens of balb/c mice  <cit> . unlike the case in other 2crs, expression of senx <dig> and regx <dig> is monocistronic as well as polycistronic  <cit> , raising the possibility that each may function independently of the other under clinically relevant conditions and during host infection. in m. smegmatis, co-transcription of senx <dig> and regx <dig> is required for the expression of phosphate-dependent genes and for optimal growth under inorganic phosphate -limiting conditions  <cit> . previously, we have shown that the senx3-regx <dig> operon is involved in the mtb phosphate starvation response   <cit> , however the individual role of each gene in mtb survival during pi depletion has not been characterized. moreover, regx <dig>  when overexpressed in m. smegmatis, can be phosphorylated in the absence of senx <dig> in pi–rich medium  <cit> , and the senx3-regx <dig> homolog phobr in e. coli also responds to nutrient starvation in addition to pi depletion  <cit> . these findings suggest that mtb senx3-regx <dig> may have a broader role in mtb virulence beyond the psr and that these two factors may function independently of each other.

in order to further understand the role of each gene of the senx3-regx <dig> 2crs in mtb virulence, and in particular the senx3-independent contribution of regx <dig>  two different mutants deficient in senx <dig> or regx <dig> were studied under multiple conditions and their phenotypes were compared to the isogenic wild-type parent strain mtb cdc <dig>  as well as their respective complemented strains. the expression of senx <dig> and regx <dig>  as well as that of the phosphate specific transport gene pstc <dig>  were evaluated in all the tested strains under physiologically relevant stress conditions. in addition, the growth and survival of each of these strains were assessed during axenic growth in nutrient-rich broth, pi depletion, nutrient starvation, and after aerosol infection in the lungs of balb/c mice. our data support the hypothesis that regx <dig> may have a senx3-independent role in mtb virulence.

RESULTS
confirmation of senx3::tn and regx3::tn complementation
in order to confirm that phenotypes observed for senx3::tn and regx3::tn were attributable to deficiency of senx <dig> and regx <dig>  respectively, we complemented each mutant by reintroducing the native gene. due to the complexity of the operon, which includes monocistronic and bicistronic transcription of each gene  <cit> , each mutant was complemented with the entire senx3-regx <dig> operon. successful complementation was confirmed by southern blot using dig-labeled probes after dna digestion of complement candidates, as well as the wild-type and mutant strains. as expected, digestion of genomic dna with fsei and hybridization with dig-labeled senx <dig> probe revealed fragments of  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb in the senx3::tn complemented strain , a  <dig> -kb fragment in the wild-type strain, and a  <dig> -kb fragment in senx3::tn . sphi digestion of genomic dna followed by binding of dig-labeled regx <dig> probe showed  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb fragments in the regx3::tn complement candidate strains , a  <dig> -kb fragment in the wild-type strain, and a  <dig> -kb fragment in regx3::tn . in addition, kanamycin and hygromycin resistance cassettes were pcr-amplified from each of these complemented strains . we have shown previously that bicistronic expression of regx <dig> was abolished in senx3::tn, although monocistronic expression of the gene is preserved in this strain  <cit> .figure  <dig>

disruption of senx <dig> reduces regx <dig> expression during phosphate depletion, but each gene is equally required for regulation of the phosphate-specific transport system
mildly reduced expression of senx <dig> and regx <dig> relative to siga was observed in regx3::tn and senx3::tn, respectively, in middlebrook 7h <dig> broth compared with the wild type parent strain . although regx <dig> can be expressed independently of senx <dig>  <cit> , disruption of the latter gene led to decreased mtb expression of regx <dig> during pi depletion  . gene expression levels of senx <dig> and regx <dig> were restored in senx3::tn comp and regx3::tn comp, respectively, during pi depletion, but the cognate genes were overexpressed in each complemented strain relative to the wild type  , likely due to a second copy of each of these genes in the respective complemented strains. in middlebrook 7h <dig> broth, mild down-regulation of pstc <dig> expression was observed in senx3::tn and regx3::tn relative to the wild-type strain , and wild-type pstc <dig> transcript levels were restored in each of the complemented strains . each mutant showed similar, significant down-regulation of the pi-specific transport gene pstc <dig> relative to the wild-type strain during pi depletion , and wild-type expression levels of the gene were restored in each complemented strain . disruption of senx <dig> led to decreased expression of regx <dig> during nutrient starvation . however, wild-type levels of senx <dig> and regx <dig> expression were not observed in senx3::tn comp and regx3::tn comp, respectively, although senx <dig> expression was partially restored in regx3::tn comp under this condition . the abundance of pstc <dig> transcripts was not significantly altered in either mutant relative to wild type during nutrient starvation .figure  <dig>

senx <dig> and regx <dig> are equally required for mtb growth during pi depletion
the growth kinetics of each mutant and its respective complement, together with the isogenic wild-type strain, were studied during pi depletion  and in reconstituted, pi-replete 7h <dig> broth . each strain showed equivalent growth in pi-replete 7h <dig> broth , suggesting that senx <dig> and regx <dig> are dispensable for axenic mtb growth when pi is abundant. however, senx3::tn and regx3::tn showed a marked growth defect and premature entry into stationary phase relative to the isogenic wild-type and their respective complemented strains during pi depletion . no obvious difference in growth was observed between the mutants.figure  <dig>

previously, we have shown that mtb bacilli undergo elongation following pi depletion  <cit> . in order to determine the effect of senx <dig> or regx <dig> deficiency on mtb morphology during pi depletion, we used transmission electron microscopy to capture images of at least  <dig> bacilli of each strain following 21 days of pi depletion or during exponential growth in reconstituted, pi-replete 7h <dig> broth. we found that the mean length of pi-depleted senx3::tn and regx3::tn bacilli was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, while the mean length of isogenic wild-type bacilli was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the mean length of the senx3::tn and regx3::tn complement bacilli was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively  . the mean length of senx3::tn bacilli  and regx3::tn bacilli  was equivalent to that of wild-type bacilli  during exponential growth in pi-replete  broth .figure  <dig>

higher survival of senx3::tn relative to regx3::tn during nutrient starvation
since both monocistronic and bicistronic expression of regx <dig> is observed in nutrient-starved mtb  <cit> , we next studied the requirement for each type of gene expression during nutrient starvation. after 7 days of nutrient starvation, senx3::tn and regx3::tn showed a significant survival defect relative to wild type , which was complemented in regx3::tn comp but not in senx3::tn comp . at this time point, senx3::tn, in which monocistronic expression of regx <dig> is maintained  <cit> , showed higher survival relative to regx3::tn . by 14 days after nutrient starvation, regx3::tn showed markedly reduced survival relative to wild type  and senx3::tn . the survival defect at 14 days was almost completely reversed in regx3::tn comp .figure  <dig>

higher survival of senx3::tn relative to regx3::tn during chronic infection in mouse lungs
in order to evaluate the potential senx3-independent role of regx <dig> on mtb virulence in vivo, we aerosol-infected mice with wild type, senx3::tn, regx3::tn, and their respective complemented strains. we observed no significant growth defect for the two mutants during the first 15 days post-infection relative to the wild-type . by day  <dig>  the wild-type strain achieved a peak bacterial cfu of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log <dig> in the lungs, and a reduction in mean lung cfu of  <dig>  log <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig>  was observed in senx3::tn and regx3::tn, respectively. by day  <dig>  mice infected with senx3::tn and regx3::tn had significant reductions in lung bacillary loads of  <dig>  log <dig> cfu  and  <dig>  log <dig> cfu  relative to mice infected with the wild-type strain. interestingly, as in the case of nutrient starvation, consistently and significantly higher lung bacillary burdens were observed in mice infected with senx3::tn compared to those in mice infected with regx3::tn at day  <dig> , day  <dig> , and day  <dig>  post-infection . in fact, at day  <dig>  the lungs of mice infected with senx3::tn had more than 10-fold higher mean cfu relative to those of mice infected with regx3::tn . this lung survival defect was partially restored in regx3::tn comp .figure  <dig>

discussion
senx3-regx <dig> is among the best characterized 2crs in mtb  <cit> , yet many questions remain about its role in virulence. homologs of senx <dig> and regx <dig> are found in the genomes of various mycobacterial species, indicating that this evolutionarily conserved 2crs may play a fundamental regulatory role in mycobacterial physiology  <cit> . unlike other 2crs, in which expression of the operon is bicistronic and auto-regulatory, senx <dig> and regx <dig> can be transcribed independently of each other  <cit> . in particular, the intergenic region between the two genes contains several mycobacterium interspersed repetitive units , which exist only in m. leprae and members of the mtb complex  <cit> , and which can drive senx3-independent expression of regx <dig>  <cit> . in the current study, we sought to investigate the senx3-independent contribution of regx <dig> to mtb gene regulation, growth, and survival under various physiologically relevant growth-limiting conditions in vitro and in vivo.

we found that the genes senx <dig> and regx <dig>  while dispensable for mtb growth in nutrient-rich broth, are equally required for optimal growth and morphological response during pi depletion. in addition, as evidenced by the statistically greater survival of senx3::tn relative to regx3::tn, we found that regx <dig> contributes to mtb survival independent of senx <dig> during prolonged nutrient starvation and chronic infection in mouse lungs.

although senx3-regx <dig> has been implicated in the mycobacterial psr  <cit> , the functional role of each gene in this operon has not been characterized previously during pi depletion. pi depletion is believed to be a physiologically relevant microenvironment encountered by mtb within the arrested macrophage phagolysosome  <cit> . mtb senx3-regx <dig> is upregulated in response to pi depletion and expression of the phosphate-specific transport operon psts3-pstc2-psta <dig> is regx3-dependent  <cit> . previously, we have shown monocistronic upregulation of senx <dig> and regx <dig> during pi depletion  <cit> , which differs from m. smegmatis, in which the senx3-regx <dig> operon is co-transcribed. in the current study, we found decreased expression of regx <dig> in the senx3-deficient mutant relative to the wild type during pi depletion, which could be restored by reintroduction of senx <dig>  decreased regx <dig> expression in pi-depleted senx3::tn may be due to decreased co-transcription with senx <dig> or down-regulation of independently expressed regx <dig>  although the senx <dig> promoter is autoregulatory and activated by regx <dig>  which is phosphorylated by senx <dig>  <cit> , it is unknown whether the intergenic region driving independent regx <dig> expression is also regx3-dependent, and, hence, senx3-dependent.

we found that mtb mutants deficient in senx <dig> or regx <dig> exhibited similar growth defects during pi depletion. despite expression of regx <dig> in the senx3-deficient mutant, it appears that regx <dig> was not functional, as expression of the regx3-dependent, pi-specific transport gene pstc <dig> was dramatically downregulated in this strain. our results are consistent with monocistronic, pi-dependent expression of each gene and the putative role of senx <dig> as a pi sensor  <cit> . therefore, although monocistronic expression of regx <dig> is preserved in senx3::tn  <cit> , the cognate hk senx <dig> may be required to phosphorylate and activate regx <dig> during pi depletion, thereby triggering the psr. in vitro studies in many bacteria have provided evidence in favor of the specificity of 2crs, in which the hk show a remarkable kinetic preference for their cognate rr primarily at the level of molecular reorganization  <cit> . for example, in b. subtilis the hk kina can phosphorylate either spo0f or spo0a, but with more than  <dig> -fold preference for spo0f during sporulation  <cit> .

interestingly, despite similar growth phenotypes of senx3::tn and regx3::tn during pi limitation, the senx3-deficient mutant showed markedly higher survival relative to the regx3-deficient mutant upon prolonged nutrient starvation and in the lungs of mice, while both mutants were attenuated compared with the wild-type. our gene expression results demonstrate reduced but detectable expression of regx <dig> in the senx3-deficient mutant. this discordance in phenotypes suggests the possibility that independently transcribed regx <dig> may be translated and phosphorylated in the absence of senx <dig>  thereby initiating transcription of the regx <dig> regulon  <cit> . in m. smegmatis, the essential gene regx <dig> can be activated in the absence of the nonessential gene senx <dig> in pi-replete broth, suggesting the existence of alternative mechanisms of regx <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . similarly, in e. coli the regx <dig> homologue phob can be phosphorylated by the hk envz  <cit> , crec , or acetyl phosphate in the absence of phor in pi-independent pathways  <cit> . precedents for phosphorylation of rr by noncognate hk are also present in mtb. thus, the mtb dormancy response regulator dosr can be phosphorylated by its cognate hk doss or by the orphan hk dost  <cit> . although 2crs usually maintain specificity to prevent unwanted cross-talk  <cit> , significant sequence and structure similarity in hk and rr, as well as the existence of small molecule phosphodonor acetyl-phosphate make cross-regulation possible  <cit> . in addition, cross-regulation could occur at the transcriptional level  <cit> . under certain circumstances many bacteria appear to employ cross-regulation in order to integrate multiple signals or diversify the response to a single input  <cit> . therefore, based on our initial findings, we speculate that although mtb senx3-regx <dig> 2crs maintains specificity during pi depletion, cross-regulation of regx <dig> may facilitate a rapid response of mtb to a changing environment in vitro and in vivo under other stresses, in which the identity of alternative hk and/or other activating factors remains to be determined. alternatively, independently transcribed regx <dig> may be functional in the absence of phosphorylation. for example, the pseudomonas aeruginosa rr algb and algr do not require phosphorylation by the cognate hk kinb for alginate production in vivo, indicating that these rr may mediate activation of gene expression through alternative mechanisms  <cit> . we speculate that the senx3-regx <dig> 2crs may provide a common means by which to transduce the signals of pi depletion and nutrient starvation, leading to induction of the stringent response, which is critical for mtb persistence in the host  <cit> . our findings are consistent with the function of the homologous phobr 2crs in e. coli, which regulates the transcriptional response to pi depletion and nutrient starvation  <cit> . the mechanism of regx <dig> regulation during nutrient starvation and in vivo infection remains to be identified.

higher survival of senx3::tn relative to regx3::tn during chronic infection in mice is consistent with previous data showing higher survival of a senx <dig> deletion mutant relative to a regx <dig> deletion mutant in mouse spleens  <cit> . however, our data conflict with those of rickman et al. in that they showed greater attenuation of the senx <dig> deletion strain in mouse lungs relative to the regx <dig> deletion strain. these discrepant findings may be due to methodological differences between our study and that by rickman et al. the latter study used h37rv, in which the senx3-regx <dig> ir comprises three identical 77-bp miru rather than two 77-bp miru and one 53-bp miru, as in the cdc <dig> strain used in our study  <cit> . in addition, rickman et al. used intravenous infection rather than aerosol infection, although both studies used balb/c mice. nevertheless, these two studies corroborate our recent finding that senx <dig> and regx <dig> do not simply function as a bicistronic operon, as previously thought  <cit> , since, in such a case, disruption of senx <dig> would be expected to yield mutant phenotypes identical to those of a regx3-deficient strain. in the current study, both complemented strains restored wild-type growth and survival during pi depletion, and, in the case of regx3::tn comp, during nutrient starvation and in the lungs of mice. however, unlike in a previous study  <cit> , our complemented strains failed to restore the wild-type phenotype during mouse infection. there are several potential explanations for these discrepant findings. in comparison to the cloning strategy by rickman et al., our senx3-regx <dig> complementation construct lacked a 211-bp sequence upstream of the senx <dig> gene, which may have altered regulation of this gene during the in vitro stress conditions studied and mouse infection. another difference between the two complementation approaches is that in the earlier study the senx <dig> and regx <dig> genes were fused together by deleting the intergenic region  <cit> . on the other hand, each of our complemented strains included this intergenic region, since we recently described the potential importance of its promoter activity in driving senx3-independent expression of regx <dig>  <cit> . the precise role of this intergenic region in regulating expression of each of these genes requires further study. in addition, the presence of a second copy of the regx <dig> gene may have had a deleterious effect on in vitro and in vivo survival. as in the case of other defective complemented strains, the chromosomal location at the recombination site may have affected proper expression of senx <dig> and regx <dig>  alternatively, the development of other occult mutations during genetic construction of these strains may have contributed to their reduced virulence relative to the wild-type strain. however, deficiency of senx <dig> or regx <dig> was reported previously to be associated with reduced mtb virulence in mice, and the attenuated mutant phenotypes were fully complemented in the study by rickman et al.  <cit> . therefore, we favor the explanation that our complementation strategy, as described above, contributed to the incomplete restoration of the wild-type phenotypes in the complemented strains. the mechanisms by which senx <dig> and regx <dig> are regulated under different stress conditions require further characterization.

CONCLUSIONS
our data raise the interesting possibility that differential regulation of senx <dig> and regx <dig> may have evolved to allow for simultaneous coordination of the mtb psr  <cit> , while providing a common means by which bacilli may respond to a variety of different physiologically relevant stress conditions. in particular, the mechanisms underlying the senx3-independent contribution of regx <dig> to mtb virulence deserves further investigation.
