BACKGROUND
popbean or nuña bean  is traditionally grown in the andean highlands of south america at  <dig> - <dig>  meters above sea level, where it is commonly sold in local markets or consumed at home, and it is thought to be an ancient pre-ceramic landrace  <cit> . it seems probable that nuña beans originated in the andes, where they are sympatric with wild and primitive common bean populations in certain parts of peru and bolivia, and they may have been present in the early stages of andean agriculture  <cit> . the first selection pressures leading to domestication of common bean could have resulted in the development of popping beans, and it appears that toasting grains was a well-established tradition in the andes and possibly in mesoamerica, where early maize races have also been used for popping. however, no evidence of nuña beans has been found in mesoamerica, most likely due to genetic differences between the mesoamerican and andean gene pools  <cit> . this, among other factors, may explain their contrasting popping ability and photoperiod response  <cit> .

popbean is tropical in appearance, with aggressive indeterminate type  <dig> growth habit  <cit>  and day-length sensitivity since it requires nights of at least 11–12 h for flowering induction. growing nuña bean in temperate areas requires the development of cultivars that are insensitive to photoperiod, like the modern dry bean cultivars. furthermore, with a view to commercial production, determinate growth habit is desirable, since it reduces growing and harvesting costs. the foremost trait that distinguishes popbean from all other types of bean is the ability to expand the cotyledons after grains explode in response to heating, which is referred to as popping expansion, similar to popcorn, although the popping mechanism is different. in popcorn, the endosperm is liquefied and explosive pressure builds up in the pericarp  <cit> , and both pericarp thickness and endosperm starch type have been attributed to the popping ability. thus, there are two crucial factors that influence the popping of popcorn: whether a kernel can pop or not, and if so, to what extent. popping rate and flake size seemingly correspond to these two factors, which together determine high popping volume  <cit> . in contrast, popping in nuña beans is the result of pressurized steam trapped within and between the mesophyll cells in the cotyledons  <cit> . the nutritive value analysis of nuña bean revealed that they have a lower mean content of protein, phosphorus, iron, and boron than dry bean varieties, and a higher level of copper and starch, which may be related to their unique texture and taste similar to roasted peanuts. lectins and other anti-nutritional compounds were higher in raw and boiled nuña samples than in toasted nuñas, while tannin levels did not change from raw to toasted treatments. overall in-vitro digestibility was slightly lower for toasted nuñas than boiled dry bean  <cit> . taken together, the nutritional features of toasted nuña beans make them a healthy snack, although commercial production would require the genetic improvement of other agronomic traits, particularly the day-length sensitivity that has likely restricted production and commercialization of nuña beans in temperate regions  <cit> .

in maize, experimental evidence indicate that popping characteristics are quantitatively inherited  <cit> , controlled by multiple genes  <cit> , and influenced by environmental effects  <cit>  and popping methods  <cit> . both additive and dominant genetic effects play very important roles in the inheritance of popping characteristics  <cit> , and several putative quantitative trait loci  have been identified  <cit> . however, most of these studies on popping ability have focused on the maize crop, and there is little information on the ability to contribute towards popping expansion of the nuña bean. the identification of genomic regions associated with this popping ability would enable breeders to develop improved cultivars using marker assisted selection . to identify these genomic regions, it is important not only to establish accurate phenotyping methods, but also to develop a saturated molecular marker-based genetic linkage map, and then to detect qtls associated with these popping traits. molecular markers have emerged as powerful tools not only for mapping genes/qtls governing economically important traits in crops  <cit> , but also for unlocking the useful genetic diversity from unadapted/wild/unrelated germplasm  <cit> .

common bean is a diploid species with a genome size estimated at  <dig> to 650 mb  <cit>  that is distributed among  <dig> chromosomes . the first core genetic linkage map of common bean was based on a recombinant inbred line  population resulting from the cross between representatives of the mesoamerican  and the andean  gene pools, which included  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphic  markers  <cit> . nowadays the availability of microsatellite markers and their potential for anchoring new genetic maps have allowed a new expanded version of the core linkage map to be created with several hundred of these types of markers, including markers with putative gene functions. thus, the current core common bean linkage map covers a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm and includes a total of  <dig> loci placed across  <dig> linkage groups  with an average distance between neighboring loci of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . in addition, about fifteen ril mapping populations and more than twenty five linkage maps have been developed, most of them created from inter-gene pool crosses, which include divergent parents showing high genetic polymorphism  <cit> . nevertheless, few populations have been generated from intra-gene pool crosses  <cit> , likely due to their low polymorphism level  <cit>  although this kind of population does not usually show phenotypic abnormalities or undesirable segregating individuals  <cit> . recently, a mesoamerican saturated intra-gene pool map has been constructed by combining the genetic information from intra- and inter-gene pool segregating populations  <cit> .

mapping qtls is of great importance to understand the genetic architecture underlying complex traits. popping expansion seems to involve several genes, environmental factors, and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. therefore, to better understand the genetic control of popping expansion, in addition to detecting single-locus qtl effects, there is a need to identify the interactions among the different loci , as well as their environment interaction effects . indeed, these interactions have been successfully analysed for other complex traits in several crops species e.g. rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , cotton  <cit>  or maize  <cit> .

in order to identify genetic determinants of popping ability traits in common bean, we have evaluated the popping dimension index , expansion coefficient  and percentage of unpopped seeds . the first two traits reflect structural changes of seeds when heating , while the third is of considerable importance for breeding and from a commercial point of view. besides, we have constructed a genetic map from an andean ril population, which includes  <dig> molecular markers. this has permitted the location of single-locus and epistatic qtls involved in pdi, ec and pus, some of which co-localized in four lgs. markers associated to these qtls could be used as genetic tools for mas programs devoted to popping improvement of nuña bean cultivars.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation of popping traits and correlations in ril population
mean values, standard deviations and ranges of variation for popping traits are shown for each environment in table  <dig>  pdi, ec and pus were clearly different between both parents and varied significantly among rils. in addition, these popping traits showed a pattern of continuous distribution, which weakly departed from normality . strong transgressive segregations were observed for these traits, indicating that alleles with positive effects are distributed among the parents. the broad sense heritability value of ec was rather low , whereas the heritability values of pdi  and pus  were moderate, suggesting that genetic gains could be obtained when selecting for these traits. the phenotypic correlations between pus and two popping traits showed that pus was significant and negatively correlated with pdi and ec, while ec was significant and positively correlated with pdi in all environments assayed . highly significant differences were found among genotypes and genotype x environment interactions for all popping traits .

genetic map construction
we screened pmb <dig> and pha <dig> parents for dna polymorphism by using amplified fragment length polymorphic , simple sequence repeat  and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers. a total of  <dig> aflp primer combinations were assayed, which allowed the amplification over  <dig>  aflp fragments,  <dig>  of which were polymorphic between the parents. according to their inheritance pattern and reliability features,  <dig> combinations, producing  <dig> polymorphic loci, were selected for genotyping the ril population. furthermore,  <dig> ssr and  <dig> snp markers were screened, which rendered polymorphism rates of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. thus,  <dig> ssr and  <dig> snp polymorphic loci were also analysed in the ril population for map construction. some of the polymorphic markers  were not linked with any other marker in the existing map and so they could not be mapped. finally, the genetic map developed from the cross pmb <dig> x pha <dig>  was constructed with a total of  <dig> loci , of which  <dig> were dominant and  <dig> codominant, resulting in the formation of  <dig> lgs. these lgs were designated according to pedrosa-harand et al.  <cit>  on the basis of  <dig> previously mapped common ssr markers  <cit> , which were used as a guide for the assignment of lg number and orientation. the map spanned a total genetic distance of  <dig>  cm, with an average of  <dig>  cm per lg, ranging from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm . the density of markers ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , with an average of  <dig>  cm per lg. a detailed description of this map is provided in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> 

single environment qtl analysis of popping traits
qtl analysis based on mqm mapping using mapqtl was undertaken to identify single-locus qtls in individual environments; thus, a total of sixteen qtls for popping traits were detected . five single-locus qtls were identified for pdi, of which one  was identified in four environments, two were detected in two environments , and the other two were detected in only one environment . the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by a single qtl identified for pdi ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . for ec, two qtls were detected in two or more environments  and two qtls were identified in only one environment ; in sd <dig> no significant qtls were detected. the percentage of phenotypic variance for ec ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . in the case of pus, seven single-locus qtls were identified, four of which were detected in two environment conditions  and three in only one environment . the percentage of phenotypic variance for pus ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . for each popping trait, qtls with positive  and negative  additive values were identified. a complete description of the mqm mapping analysis is provided in table  <dig>

multiple environment qtl analysis of popping traits
in addition to the single-locus qtls identified for each environment, a single-locus qtl analysis for multi-environment was also carried out by using qtlnetwork. as the result of one-dimensional mcim analysis, a total of fourteen single-locus qtls were detected with significant genetic main effects and/or qtls x environment  effects . four single-locus qtls were detected for pdi, three of which showed only individual additive effects ; and the remaining qtl  had both individual additive and qe interaction effects. the percentage of phenotypic variation explained for pdi by a single qtl ranged from  <dig>   to 7% ; in the case of qtl pdi7pp, the phenotypic variation explained by qe interaction effects ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . for ec, four single locus qtls were detected, two of which displayed only individual additive effects  while the other two showed both individual additive and qe interaction effects . the percentage of phenotypic variance for ec ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % ; the phenotypic variation explained by qe interaction effects ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . six qtls were identified for pus, two of which had only individual additive effects  while the other four displayed both individual additive and qe interaction effects . the percentage of phenotypic variance for pus ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % ; the phenotypic variation explained by qe interaction effects ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . for the three popping traits, single-locus qtls with positive and negative additive values were detected, indicating that alleles from both parents, pha <dig> and pmb <dig>  have a positive agronomical effect on the traits. a complete report of the one-dimensional genome scan analysis using qtlnetwork is given in table  <dig>

epistatic and environmental interactions
given that popping expansion seem to be a complex polygenic trait, genetic interactions may have significant effects on the phenotypic values. therefore, two-dimensional genome scan was undertaken for multi-environment analysis using qtlnetwork to identify epistatic and environment interactions among qtls. a total of ten epistatic qtls  involved in six epistatic interactions  were detected for the three evaluated traits. the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the interaction of these e-qtls was low, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig> % . interestingly, the ten e-qtls identified were previously detected as single-locus qtls, which indicated that these qtls not only participated in epistatic interactions, but they also had an individual effect. regarding pdi, only one epistatic interaction was detected, between qtls e-pdi3pp and e-pdi7pp, explaining  <dig> % of phenotypic variation. for ec, two epistatic interactions were identified involving four e-qtls; the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the interactions of e-ec3pp-e-ec9pp and e-ec5pp-e-ec7pp was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. e-qtl x environment  interaction effects were not significant for either pdi or ec popping traits. in the case of pus, three epistatic interactions and four e-qtls were detected, and two of the interactions showed only genetic effects and explained  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of phenotypic variation, respectively. the remaining epistatic interaction  had both genetic and e-qe interaction effects, and the percentage of phenotypic variation obtained was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for genetic and e-qe interaction effects, respectively. a detailed description of the digenic epistatic interaction analysis is shown in table  <dig>

discussion
the main goal of the current study was to unravel the genetic architecture of popping ability in nuña bean. thus, popping traits related to changes in the physical structure of seeds have been analysed on the basis of their similarity to popcorn, whose cotyledons also expand when dry grains are heated. genetic analysis performed indicated that popping ability traits show a polygenic inheritance, making this the first work to report the genetic control of these traits in common bean. transgressive segregation was observed for popping traits, suggesting that combinations of alleles from both parents have effects in the same direction; in fact, not only pha <dig> but also pmb <dig> bear alleles with a positive effect on popping ability, a finding backed up by qtl analyses. since transgressive segregation relies on additive genetic variation, the extreme phenotypes can be maintained and fixed through artificial selection, providing the potential for improvement of popping ability. furthermore, the analysis of variance showed that although the genotype x environment interaction affects popping ability, this effect is fairly uniform across all genotypes, and it does not seriously compromise genotypic main effects, making progress from selection feasible.

a comprehensive qtl analysis was performed to detect single-locus qtls, epistatic qtls and their environment interactions on a newly created genetic linkage map. this map was constructed for an andean intra-gene pool cross involving pmb <dig>  and pha <dig>  parents. despite the morphological diversity observed in the andean intra-gene pool, the low genetic polymorphism existing in this common bean germplasm hinders the development of genetic linkage maps  <cit> . our results confirmed a low polymorphism between the andean parents, thus the overall polymorphism rate detected was  <dig> %. likewise, blair et al.  <cit>  screened a total of  <dig> ssr markers on the andean parents g <dig> and g <dig>  but only  <dig> mappable markers were found in that survey resulting in a polymorphism rate of  <dig> %, comparable to the level of polymorphism here reported . however, cichy et al.  <cit>  found a moderate ssr polymorphism of 30% between the andean parents used to generate a g <dig> x and <dig> ril mapping population.

interestingly, the genetic map described in this work shares  <dig> ssr markers with previously published common bean maps  <cit> . in fact, linkage associations have been found in terms of ssr marker mapping in the present map and previous maps, while the collinear order of the commonly mapped ssr loci has been generally observed although some inversions affecting ssr markers located close to one another have been detected. since these loci were distributed throughout all lgs, they would permit the alignment of homologous lgs between maps and facilitate marker transfer across populations as well as between related species. hence, these shared markers could be used as anchor points for map merging and syntenic analysis such as galeano et al.  <cit>  have recently reported for the consensus mesoamerican intra-gene pool map.

the genetic linkage map developed herein includes  <dig> loci  across  <dig> lgs that cover a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm, with an average of  <dig>  cm per marker. prior to this work, two andean maps have been described for qtl analysis; the map depicted by cichy et al.  <cit>  included  <dig> loci that spanned a total map length of 1105 cm with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm per locus. on the other hand, the map constructed by blair et al.  <cit>  contained  <dig> loci with a total map length of  <dig>  cm and a mean marker density of  <dig>  cm per locus. therefore, compared to previous andean maps  <cit> , the genetic map here developed shows a suitable marker density and genome coverage, which has permitted the first identification of popping ability qtls.

three closely related popping traits such as pdi, ec, and pus have been analysed and the reliability of the qtls associated to these traits has been enhanced by using several software programs, which decreased the risk of detecting false positive and negative qtls  <cit> . therefore, single and multi-environment qtl analyses were performed to dissect the genetic architecture of popping ability in nuña bean. in summary, a total of nineteen single-locus qtls were identified by mapqtl and qtlnetwork. eleven of the fourteen qtls identified by qtlnetwork were also detected by mapqtl; thus, the two independent approaches converged on the identification of common single-locus qtls for pdi , ec , and pus . the percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the single-locus qtls identified by mapqtl for popping traits was comparatively higher than that of the qtlnetwork. the results of multi-environment analyses showed that genetic main effects were sometimes subject to environmental modification; this could explain why we obtained a lower phenotypic variance using qtlnetwork software. even so, for multi-environment analyses, the percentage of phenotypic variance attributable to genetic effects was as expected for a complex trait, which is governed by several small effect qtls/genes located in different genomic regions, and where the environment interactions play an important role. therefore, the four common single-locus qtls detected for pdi and pus together explained  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance, respectively. regarding ec, the three common qtls explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance in the ril population. in addition, it was interesting to find that the common qtls  not only were consistent over environments, but they also co-localized with qtls for the analysed popping traits.

overall, significant positive correlations between pdi and ec and negative correlations among pus, and pdi and ec, together with the detection of co-localized qtls for pdi, ec, and pus on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  suggested that qtls for popping ability are not evenly dispersed throughout the genome but rather are clustered in several genomic regions. the qtls sign values of additive effects corresponded to the significant genotypic correlations observed among the three popping traits. thus, the co-localized qtls located on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed positive  and negative  values of additive effects for pdi and ec, and pus, respectively. meanwhile, the opposite sign values of additive effects were found for the co-localized qtls located on lg  <dig>  which indicated that pmb <dig> also contributes positively to popping ability. to date, research into popping ability has focused on popcorn. thus, babu et al.  <cit>  detected four qtls for popping expansion volume, five for flake volume, and five for percentage of unpopped kernels, and revealed qtls in overlapping or mostly adjoining regions in the same chromosomes affecting two or three popping traits. likewise, li et al.  <cit>  evaluated three important traits for popcorn , and six chromosome regions were found to control two or three popping traits simultaneously. hence, as in nuña bean, the detection of co-localized qtls for popping traits suggested that either pleiotropic qtls controlled several popping traits, or tightly linked qtls for different traits are present together in the same genomic regions. the issue of pleiotropy versus tight linkage of qtls may be resolved in the future through fine mapping of the target genomic regions.

epistatic effects are often involved in complex traits, but they are difficult to confirm because of their usually small effects and environmental interactions. genetic models for qtl mapping assuming no epistasis could lead to biased estimation of qtl parameters, and subsequently result in considerable loss of response in mas. in popcorn, li et al.  <cit>  carried out a preliminary epistatic analysis and detected thirteen pairs of digenic interactions for popping ability. in the present work, several epistatic interactions were found involving all of the evaluated popping traits. a total of ten e-qtls, involved in six epistatic interactions, were detected, and only one epistatic interaction for pus showed significant e-qe interaction effect. although the phenotypic variation explained by each epistatic interaction was found to be small, it is interesting to note that the genomic regions located on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> not only harbor qtls that have individual genetic effects, but are also involved in epistatic interactions. therefore, qtl analysis revealed that popping ability of nuña bean is controlled by several qtls, which have only individual additive effects, or may also be involved in epistatic or environmental interactions, indicating that popping is inherited as a polygenic trait, and that epistasis could play a key role.

nowadays, popping of common bean is considered an interesting agronomic trait, since it allows greater diversification of this crop as well as the commercialization of nuña bean as a new snack product. in popcorn, selection for increased expansion coefficient has been successfully achieved given its high heritability value  <cit> . similarly, vorwald and nienhuis  <cit>  estimated that the narrow sense heritability values of fully expanded seeds after popping  and expansion coefficient in nuña bean were relatively high,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the broad sense heritability values calculated in the present work were moderate, suggesting that genetic gain could be obtained for popping ability in this legume species. the introgression of popping and the development of new day-length insensitive popbean cultivars would require genetic tools which facilitate efficient genotyping selection. conventional phenotype selection methods for popping traits are laborious and time-consuming; consequently, mas provides an efficient and cost-effective alternative that accelerates the selection of interesting genotypes. however, mas approaches have been difficult to apply in the case of complex traits such as popping ability, because individual qtls have small genetic effects which in many cases are also environmentally modulated. consequently, the identification of potential candidate qtls for mas is crucial. based on the results obtained in our study, the co-localized qtls located on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are good candidates for mas, since they showed stability across significantly correlated traits, while also sharing qtls for more than one trait, and they could be manipulated simultaneously in breeding programs. breeding of nuña cultivars would require adapting them to temperate regions, and for this purpose it is important to improve their insensitivity to photoperiod. the ppd gene regulates photoperiod sensitivity and it is located on lg  <dig>  <cit> , while popping qtls are located on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  therefore, the use of qtl marker assisted selection would facilitate the introgression of photoperiod insensitivity without loss of popping ability. qtl pyramiding approach would also permit the combination of qtl alleles with positive effects for popping ability on a day-length insensitive genotype through molecular breeding, thus overcoming the main drawback for the production and commercialization of nuña beans in temperate regions. in this research, some rils showed popping expansion ability and flowered independently of photoperiod conditions. these lines constitute an interesting breeding goal, and they will hopefully allow researchers to isolate the genes and to understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying agronomic traits which are relevant for the genetic improvement of nuña beans.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel andean genetic linkage map, which has permitted the first identification of popping ability qtls in common bean. our results revealed that popping ability of nuña bean is controlled by several qtls, which have only individual additive effects or may also be involved in epistatic or environmental interactions, indicating that popping is inherited as a polygenic trait, and that epistasis could play a key role in its genetic control. individual and multi-environment qtl analyses detected a total of nineteen single-locus qtls, most notably those co-localized for the three popping ability traits placed on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  these qtls showed an individual effect and also participated in epistatic interactions. consequently, the co-localized qtls for popping expansion response are useful tools for mas breeding programs intended to improve production and adaptation of nuña bean cultivars. the results here reported can contribute towards the diversification of the nuña bean crop, which is becoming increasingly relevant as a new food product in the agro-food industry due to its nutritional and healthy properties.
