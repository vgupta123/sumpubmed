BACKGROUND
the family of cle  peptide phytohormones includes small  mobile peptides. being translated as precursors of about  <dig> amino acid  residues, mature cle peptides include the only conserved c-terminal cle domain of 12– <dig> aa  <cit> . cle peptides bind to clv1-like receptor protein kinases and trigger the poorly studied pathway of signal transduction, which eventually changes the expression level of wox genes, central regulators of stem cell pools in different meristems  <cit> . cle peptides were found in various plant species  <cit>  and also outside of the plant kingdom, in some parasitic nematodes  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana genome contains  <dig> cle genes with different spatial and temporal expression patterns  <cit> . it is accepted that functions of most cle peptides in the meristems consist in the negative regulation of stem cell proliferation and thereby maintaining meristem size. an exception from this is a small group of tdif -like cle peptides, which do not suppress cell proliferation in the meristems or even stimulate it in the procambium and cambium  <cit> . according to  <cit> , cle peptides which do not suppress meristematic cell proliferation, are combined in the group b, whereas other cle peptides form group a. b-type cles differ from other cle peptides by the specific amino acid composition of the cle domain and some features in post-translational modification  <cit> . among  <dig> cle peptides of arabidopsis, closely related cle <dig>  cle <dig>  and cle <dig> belong to the group b  <cit> . some arabidopsis cle peptides function as central regulators of apical and lateral primary meristems: in particular, clv <dig> peptide is required for correct sam development  <cit> ; cle <dig> has similar function in ram  <cit> ; cle41/cle <dig> controls the development of procambium and cambium  <cit> . in addition, several cle peptides regulate other types of meristems, e.g. a-type cles mtcle <dig> and pscle <dig> regulate development of nodule meristems in medicago truncatula and pisum sativum respectively  <cit> . moreover, cle peptides are supposed to regulate other developmental processes, like early embryogenesis  <cit>  or vessel development  <cit> . taking all of this into account, we can hypothesize that cles may function as regulators of storage root development in radish.

radish  is an important vegetable crop because of its edible storage root. several variations of cultivated radish are known, e.g. cherry radish , oil radish , feed radish , black radish , and large root radish, or daikon . according to most opinions, r. sativus l. was originated from wild radish r. raphanistrum l. or was derived by hybridization between r. maritimus and r. landra  <cit> . in recent years, the radishbase  <cit> , a genomic database of radish, was developed  <cit> , and comprehensive analysis of expressed sequence tags from cultivated and wild radish was performed  <cit> . a genetic collection of r. sativus l. var. radicola pers is maintained in saint-petersburg state university  since  <dig>  this collection was derived from single plants belonging to three radish cultivars  by inbreeding during more than  <dig> generations. at present, the collection includes  <dig> self-compatible highly inbred lines; some of them demonstrate different morphological abnormalities   <cit> .

unlike its close relative arabidopsis thaliana, r. sativus has a peculiar developmental feature, namely the formation of a storage root . therefore, radish is a perspective model to study mechanisms of storage root development. it is known that radish crop-root originates from the hypocotyl and upper part of root  <cit>  due to the secondary thickening as a result of cambium activity  <cit> . the secondary thickening involves proliferation of vascular cambium and differentiation of secondary xylem and phloem inwards and outwards from cambium. in case of radish the proportion of phloem and xylem differentiation is shifted towards xylem . as a result, mature radish storage root is composed of a large zone of secondary xylem tissue surrounded by a narrow cambial zone, band of secondary phloem, and outer layer of secondary cortex derived from pericycle  <cit> . zone of secondary xylem in radish storage root is quite clearly separated into central and periphery parts. periphery part of secondary xylem zone includes vessels surrounded by rows of small-cell thick-walled parenchyma cells which perform predominantly mechanical function ; vessels and mechanical parenchyma form bands, separated by wide radial rays of thin-walled parenchyma cells filled with starch grains  <cit> . central part of secondary xylem in the root of r. sativus includes more rare vessels lying in the mass of the thin-walled storage parenchyma . some researchers  <cit>  noted that zone of secondary xylem in radish storage root  also includes numerous little foci of cambium-like secondary meristem  which are maintained for a limited time and give rise to a small number of tertiary conductive elements. on the other hand, r. raphanistrum, presumable ancestor of r. sativus  <cit>  demonstrate less extensive secondary thickening and does not form storage root. the main differences in the anatomical structure of r. sativus and r. raphanistrum are less extensive zone of secondary xylem and significantly fewer cells of the storage parenchyma in the root of r. raphanistrum .fig.  <dig> comparison of the anatomical structure of raphanus raphanistrum  and raphanus sativus  roots . xyi—primary xylem, xyii—secondary xylem, ca—cambium, ph—phloem, co—cortex, vs—vessels, mxp—mechanical xylem parenchyma, sxp—storage xylem parenchyma, rr—radial ray



the main goal of our investigation was determining of the role of cle peptides in the development of storage root in radish. in the present work we identified raphanus sativus rscle genes based on their homology with corresponding arabidopsis thaliana atcle genes. then, we analyzed the expression of rscle genes in different parts of seedling, and also in the roots at different stages of development in r. sativus which forms storage root and in r. raphanistrum which does not. in addition, we studied the effect of overexpression of certain rscle genes of a- and b-types as well as the effect of exogenously applied cle peptides on radish storage root development. our data suggest the involvement of rscle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes in the development of radish storage root. finally, we studied the effect of exogenous cytokinin and auxin on the expression of several a- and b-type rscle genes. the results obtained indicate that cle-peptides, cytokinins and auxins may interact during the development of radish storage root.

RESULTS
identification of raphanus sativus cle  genes
the genome of arabidopsis thaliana contains  <dig> cle genes  <cit> , and each of them has its own unique expression pattern  <cit> . we identified radish homologues of the most part of arabidopsis atcle genes whose expression, according to  <cit> , was observed in the root . in total we have identified  <dig> rscle genes homologous to arabidopsis a-type cle genes  and  <dig> rscles that are homologous to arabidopsis b-type cle genes . cds  of rscles identified demonstrated  <dig> – <dig>  % of identity with corresponding atcle genes  and also with cle-like sequences of brassica rapa  <cit> . however, we failed to find radish homologues of atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  and atcle <dig> genes: all primer sets that were designed based on corresponding genes of arabidopsis did not give any pcr product on radish dna or anneal to other closely related rscles. therefore, we suppose that there are no homologues of cle <dig>  cle <dig>  and cle <dig> genes in raphanus sativus genome. the sequences homologous to atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  and atcle <dig> genes are also absent among identified brassica rapa sequences  <cit> .table  <dig> identified raphanus sativus cle  genes

predicted sequences of cle domains of most of rscles are similar to those of atcles. exceptions are rscle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> whose cle domains presumably differ from arabidopsis in one or two amino acids . like atcle genes, rscles gene sequences are short, their coding sequence lengths are 240–330 bp. most of rscles, like atcles, lack introns, with the exception of rscle <dig>  which has two introns like its homologue atcle <dig>  <cit> .

according to previous data, substitution of the glycine residue in the sixth position of cle domain has the most pronounced effect on the function of cle peptides in arabidopsis  <cit> . the glycine at sixth position is highly conserved in cle-domains of all arabidopsis cle peptides; the only exception is atcle <dig> that has cysteine at sixth position of cle-domain. however, all identified radish cles contain conserved glycine residue in the sixth position of cle-domain.

qrt-pcr analysis of rscle genes expression
using qrt-pcr method, we analyzed rscle genes expression in different organs of r. sativus and r. raphanistrum seedlings. most of rscles expressed in all parts of plants, but some of them were expressed in a certain plant organ only, e.g. rscle <dig>  rscle <dig>  and rscle <dig> demonstrated root-specific expression . according to literature data  <cit>  corresponding atcle genes have similar expression pattern in seedlings. among studied rscles, expression of rscle <dig> was the strongest in root and hypocotyl of r. sativus seedlings, whereas rscle <dig> and rscle <dig> were the most weakly expressed genes . expression patterns of some rscles slightly differed in r. sativus and r. raphanistrum seedlings—e.g. rscle <dig> expressed at high level in the root of r. sativus but not in the root of r. raphanistrum.

then we analyzed the expression of rscles in the root and hypocotyl in two different lines of r. sativus and in r. raphanistrum at different developmental stages: 7-day old seedling, 15- and 30-day old plants . in r. sativus 15-day old plants at four leaves stage, storage root formation is started through the extensive root thickening, in 30-day old plants at rosette stage root thickening reaches the maximum  <cit> . in contrast to r. sativus, r. raphanistrum does not form a storage root, and therefore demonstrates less pronounced root thickening at the same developmental stages which gave us the reason to check whether r. sativus and r. raphanistrum differ in expression levels of rscles

we revealed that expression levels of some rscles were significantly increased or decreased in the roots and hypocotyls of 15- and 30-day old plants of both analyzed r. sativus lines, but not in the roots and hypocotyls of r. raphanistrum . genes, whose expression increases tenfold and more in thickening storage root of r. sativus, included one a-type cle gene  , and one b-type cle gene— . at the same time, expression levels of other five a-type cle genes—rscle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> decreased significantly  during root thickening in r. sativus plants .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of rscle genes expression. a, b

for more detailed expression analysis of rscle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> we dissected several zones in r. sativus storage root  and periphery  parts of secondary xylem, and also phloem + cambium ) and then analyzed rscles expression in these zones. we found that rscle <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are expressed in all tissues across radish root, while rscle <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have zone-specific expression pattern. rscle <dig> and  <dig> are expressed specifically in secondary xylem, and rscle <dig> is expressed in the phloem and cambium zones. it is interesting that the expression of all studied rscles was revealed in secondary meristem foci which are initiated in central part of xylem in radish storage root .

according to our results, three rscles  specifically express in certain tissues that provide secondary growth of root . moreover, dramatic change of their expression levels was associated with the beginning of extensive root thickening in r. sativus. so, we suppose that these genes may participate in the regulation of storage root development.

in arabidopsis,  <dig> of  <dig> atcle genes encoding a-type cle peptides are also expressed in roots, and some of them demonstrate tissue-specific expression pattern  <cit> . all arabidopsis genes encoding b-type cle peptides  are expressed in the vascular tissues of all plant organs including the root  <cit> ; atcle <dig> and bncle <dig> genes of arabidopsis and brassica roots are expressed specifically in pericycle cells facing the protoxylem poles  <cit> , and atcle2—in the primordial of lateral roots  <cit> .

effect of altered expression levels of rscles and of treatment with exogenous cle peptides on radish storage root development
many investigators have studied the changes in different aspects of plant development caused by altered expression levels of cle genes, or by treatment of plants with exogenous cle peptides. most of such studies are focused mainly on sam and ram activity , some of them also consider cambium activity and vascular system development  <cit> . these experiments revealed that b-type cle peptides  stimulate proliferation of cambium cells via activation of wox <dig> gene expression, and also inhibit their differentiation into xylem. on the other hand, it is obvious that some a-type cle peptides also take part in the development of vascular system; e.g. overexpression of cle <dig> gene in arabidopsis and brassica stimulated the differentiation of xylem, leading to the formation of xylem “islands” in the flower organs  <cit> ; atcle <dig> inhibits vessel formation in arabidopsis roots via repression of the expression of two type-a arabidopsis response regulators , arr <dig> and arr <dig>  whose products act as negative regulators of cytokinin signaling  <cit> .

thus, a- and b-type cle peptides may control the balance between cambium cells proliferation and differentiation of xylem. nevertheless, simultaneous overexpression of a- and b-type cle genes, or plant treatment by cle peptides from both groups leads to more pronounced stimulating effect on cambium cell proliferation than overexpression of only b-type cle genes  <cit> . therefore, interaction of a- and b-type cles in the control of vascular system development and root secondary growth is more complex than simple antagonism.

we have studied the effect of overexpression of several rscles, encoding a-type  and b-type  cle peptides on secondary root structure in radish. we also treated r. sativus and r. raphanistrum plants by synthetic cle peptides cle <dig>  cle <dig>  and cle <dig>  both experiments provided very similar results: plants with shifted quantity of a certain cle peptide in the root  had altered development of storage root tissues .fig.  <dig> effect of cle-peptides on the development of raphanus raphanistrum and raphanus sativus roots. a-h—effect of exogenous cle peptides supplying. transverse sections of raphanus sativus line  <dig>  and raphanus raphanistrum  roots of 15-day old plants after 7 days cultivation of medium with synthetic cle-peptides: control  , cle19p , cle41p , and cle2p . i-m effect of rscle <dig> overexpression on development of meristematic foci in the central part of xylem zone. i, j transverse sections of mature  roots of raphanus sativus line 19: i—gus overexpression ; j

first, roots of r. sativus 15- and 30-day old plants with overexpression of rscles or after treatment by cle peptides demonstrated altered quantity of certain type of secondary xylem elements—mechanical xylem parenchyma, which is normally adjacent to vessels in mature storage root of radish. unexpectedly, number of secondary xylem vessels remained unchanged .

in the root of the radish plants with rscle <dig> overexpression or treated by cle <dig> the cells of the mechanical xylem parenchyma were absent. the same effect we observed in the radish roots with overexpression of rscle <dig> or treated by cle <dig> peptide. conversely, rscle <dig> overexpression or cle <dig> peptide treatment increased the number of mechanical xylem parenchyma cells . therefore, a-type cle peptides cle <dig> and cle <dig> presumably play different roles in the differentiation of secondary xylem elements, mainly of mechanical xylem parenchyma. earlier, the negative effect of cle <dig> on xylem differentiation was observed in arabidopsis  <cit> ; fiers et al. also revealed stimulatory effect of cle <dig> on formation of extra xylem islands in arabidopsis  <cit> ; but the effect of cle <dig> on xylem differentiation was not previously observed.

secondly, radish roots with overexpression of rscle <dig> or treatment by cle <dig> peptide had increased number of meristematic foci in a central part of secondary xylem. according to literature data  <cit> , during the formation of storage root in radish some xylem parenchyma cells proliferate giving rise to meristematic foci—small areas of secondary cambium capable to divide and differentiate into phloem and xylem cells. in the roots with overexpression of rscle <dig> or treated with cle <dig> peptide these “meristematic foci” are enlarged and include small thin-walled cells, similar to cells of cambium, young vessels surrounding cells thick-walled xylem parenchyma cells and also phloem cells . therefore, in the storage root of radish, cle <dig> can stimulate the proliferation of not only regular cambium, but also of cambium cells in the meristematic foci.

we also treated r. raphanistrum roots with exogenous cle-peptides. in contrast to r. sativus, the effect of cle-peptides on r. raphanistrum root structure was less pronounced, however, the general trend of the changes was the same. cle19p slightly increased the number of mechanical xylem parenchyma, but there was no statistically significant difference in the number of xylem elements between control and cle19-treated plants. cle <dig> increased cambium cells number, however, no extra cambium foci were observed in the secondary xylem of cle41-treated as well as in control r. raphanistrum plants. treatment with cle2p did not cause any changes in the number of xylem elements in r. raphanistrum roots. we speculate that different effects of cle peptides on root structure of r. sativus that forms storage roots and r. raphanistrum may result from the differences in regulation of secondary root development in these radish species. moreover, these two species might have initially different levels of other plant hormones interacting with cle-peptides, which also could lead to different responses to exogenous cle-peptide treatment.

influence of exogenous cytokinin and auxin on expression of rscle genes
it is well known that auxins and cytokinins are two main groups of phytohormones regulating the development of vascular system and secondary thickening of root. in the primary root of arabidopsis these hormones demonstrate complementary patterns of distribution: auxins are concentrated in the differentiated xylem, while cytokinins are present in the cambium and phloem. complementary auxin and cytokinin distribution is believed to be required for the proper development of the vascular system and to result from of cytokinin-dependent control of polar auxin transport and auxin-dependent repression of cytokinin signaling  <cit> . cytokinins are necessary for induction of cambium in procambium and also cambium cell proliferation  <cit> , auxin is also needed for proliferation of cambium—probably due to auxin-dependent control of wox <dig> gene expression  <cit> . auxin transport and signaling components also play a key role in vascular cell specification  <cit> .

so, there are two groups of regulators that control the development of vascular system and root secondary thickening—auxins and cytokinins along with cle-peptides. it is probable that they can have some common targets—e.g. wox <dig> gene, and thereby, they may interact.

previously, some data on the interaction between cytokinins and cle-peptides or auxins and cle peptides have been reported. in m. truncatula, it was discovered that synthetic cytokinin bap has a stimulating effect on the expression of mtcle <dig> and mtcle <dig> genes which are central regulators of symbiotic nodule formation  <cit> . conversely, arabidopsis a-type cle peptide atcle <dig> can stimulate cytokinin signaling by negative regulation of a-type arr gene expression  <cit> . in rice, a-type cle gene oscle <dig> expression was induced by exogenous application of iaa  <cit> . in arabidopsis lateral root formation some atcles were up- or down-regulated by different hormones—auxin, aba, brassinosteroids, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, as well as by nutrients and stress  <cit> . however, almost nothing is known about the mechanism of interaction of cle-peptides and other hormones.

we measured the effect of exogenous auxin  and cytokinin  treatment on the expression of rscles in upper part of the root and lower part of hypocotyl of r. sativus seedlings. we observed different expression dynamics for analyzed a-type  and b-type  rscles in response to cytokinin treatment. expression of a-type rscles strongly decreased  after bap treatment, even as early as  <dig>  h after the treatment, whereas the expression of group b rscles in response to bap was not significantly altered . we also observed different expression dynamics for the same a- and b-type rscles in response to treatment by auxin: expression levels of a-type rscles increased , while expression of b-type genes  decreased dramatically .fig.  <dig> effect of exogenous cytokinin   and auxin   on expression of rscle <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in upper part of root of raphanus sativus seedlings. error bars indicate standard deviation of three technical repeats. 



therefore, the same a- and b-type rscles analyzed demonstrated quite different dynamics of expression in response to auxin and cytokinin: cytokinin seems to repress the expression of a-type rscles but it did not influence the b-type rscles; conversely, auxin seems to stimulate expression of a-type gene rscle <dig> and negatively regulate both b-type rscles.

our results coincide with data on the role of cytokinin and b-type cles, and also auxin and a-type cles in the development of vascular system. it is known that auxin  <cit>  and a-type cles such as atcle <dig>  <cit>  stimulate xylem differentiation, whereas cytokinin  <cit>  and b-type cles  <cit>  are necessary for cambium development. taking that into account, we can suppose that these three groups of phytohormones can interact during the formation of plant vascular system and the development of radish storage root.

CONCLUSIONS
mechanisms underlying the formation of the storage root are poorly understood. in our study, we investigated the role of cle peptides in the development of storage root of radish. our data indicate that some cle peptides such as cle <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may play a role in this process. thus, the existing ideas about the functions of these peptides in plant development can be extended. our findings on the effect of cytokinin and auxin on expression of genes encoding a- and b-types cle peptides allow to suppose the interaction between different groups of phytohormones in the development of storage root of radish.
