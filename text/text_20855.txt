BACKGROUND
avian skin carries feathers and scales which commence development prior to hatching. in birds, feathers develop within specific regions of the skin called tracts, while scales and spurs form only on the legs and feet  <cit> . before the development of cutaneous appendages, the embryonic skin consists of two morphologically homogenous tissue layers: the dermis and the overlying epidermis. classical tissue recombination experiments have shown that the development of feather and scale primordia is achieved through communication between these two tissue layers  <cit> . prior to the morphological appearance of feather rudiments, the dermal cells proliferate to form a dense tissue layer. signalling from the dense dermis induces rows of overlying epidermal cells to become competent to form the feather primordia. these rows, which can be visualised with molecular markers, break up to form distinct, circular epidermal condensations called placodes  <cit> . this process occurs in a wave which travels laterally across the skin, laying down the feather pattern row by row. signalling from the patterned epidermis induces separate dermal condensations to form underneath each placode, and individual placodes undergo rapid proliferation to form outgrowths. subsequent branching and differentiation result in the formation of a mature feather  <cit> .

the early stages of chicken skin patterning involve a number of activatory and inhibitory molecular signals. wnt/β-catenin signalling plays an activatory role, since forced activation of this pathway results in the formation of ectopic feather buds in embryonic chicken skin  <cit> . fgf signalling also appears to be activatory as overexpression of dominant negative fgf receptors in embryonic chicken skin suppresses feather placode formation  <cit> , while application of recombinant fgfs can induce placodes  <cit> . members of the bmp family are considered to act as opposing inhibitory factors; retroviral expression of bmp <dig> or  <dig> in chicken skin, or application of recombinant bmp protein to skin in culture, blocks feather placode formation  <cit> . these experiments have begun to reveal the key pathways involved in chicken skin patterning, but genetic evidence implicating the specific molecules acting in these multi-component pathways is as yet lacking.

mutants in which feather development is affected offer a valuable opportunity to explore the developmental mechanisms involved in ectodermal appendage formation from embryonic skin. scaleless  is a chicken mutant which lacks almost all feathers, as well as scutate scales and spurs  <cit> . the defect is known to originate in embryogenesis when feather and scale placodes fail to form  <cit> . this dramatic trait  is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and has yet to be genetically characterised. the scaleless  mutation originated in a flock of new hampshire chickens at the university of california, davis in  <dig>  <cit> . the original mutant line was subjected to outcrossing and selection for cold tolerance to generate two divergent lines; the scaleless low line which has no scales and is almost completely featherless, exhibiting only very few feathers which typically form on the thigh; and the scaleless high line, which also exhibits no scales but has greater feather coverage than the low line due to unlinked modifier alleles  <cit> . sc/sc mutants have been used extensively since the 1960s to study the tissue interactions which take place during skin development. these studies have shown that reciprocal signalling between the epidermal and dermal tissue layers is required during feather patterning, and that the timing of these signals is key  <cit> . the sc gene also appears to be redundantly involved in chicken limb development as the ectrodactyly mutation, identified in the 1960s, produces limb and beak defects on the scaleless background, but results in beak deformities only on a wild type background  <cit> . in addition to analyses of embryonic processes, sc/sc chickens have been used in a number of behavioural studies, including investigations into the acquired versus innate nature of dustbathing and wing flapping  <cit> .

detailed studies of developing sc/sc skin have shown that dense dermis forms in these mutants, but subsequent epidermal placode formation does not occur  <cit> . tissue recombination experiments indicated that the primary defect is epidermal, since recombination between wild type epidermis and sc/sc dermis results in placode formation, whereas the reverse combination of sc/sc epidermis and wild type dermis does not  <cit> . molecular markers of feather patterning, such as ctnnb <dig> and edar, are expressed broadly in sc/sc embryonic skin, but their expression does not resolve into a punctate pattern  <cit> , or is only transiently punctate in some regions of the body  <cit> , suggesting that the epidermis is unable to participate in pattern formation. dermal condensations do not form in sc/sc skin and the dermal condensate marker delta- <dig> remains diffusely expressed throughout the dermis  <cit> . thus the molecular identification of the sc gene will define a key endogenous regulator of feather patterning.

sc/sc mutants are also potentially useful for meat production in hot climates. hot conditions depress the growth rate of modern meat-type chickens  due to elevation in body temperature, and consequently they yield less meat with poorer feed efficiency  <cit> . therefore, in hot climates broiler houses require costly and polluting cooling systems. reduced feather coverage improves heat tolerance  <cit> . as a result, featherless broilers do not suffer in hot conditions; they grow normally, yield significantly more breast meat and display better viability than feathered broilers  <cit> . thus breeding for reduction or elimination of feather coverage offers a cost effective, animal-friendly and environmentally-friendly approach to broiler meat production in hot climates.

to enhance our understanding of feather development, and to facilitate efficient introgression of the featherless trait into production lines, we sought to identify the sc mutation. we mapped sc to a region on chromosome  <dig> and show that a nonsense mutation in fgf <dig>  a gene expressed in developing feathers, is completely associated with the sc/sc phenotype.

RESULTS
we used the illumina 60 k chicken snp chip to map the sc locus based on genotyping of dna from pooled samples of blood  <cit> . blood pools were prepared from  <dig> sc/sc individuals and from  <dig> sc/+ individuals, which were segregating progeny of the same sc/sc sires and sc/+ dams and thus shared a similar genetic background. dna extracted from each of these two pools was hybridised to the chip. the intensity readings at each of the snp’s alleles were used to calculate relative allelic frequency . the absolute difference in raf  between the sc/sc and sc/+ groups was plotted against the genomic location of each snp. one hundred and fifty seven snps, all located within an 18 mb region of chromosome  <dig> , showed exceptionally high absrafdif values. of these, a peak of  <dig> snps all with an absrafdif value of > <dig> , was located within a  <dig>  mb region , suggesting this region on chromosome  <dig> as the location of the sc mutation .

to identify the sc mutation, we amplified and sequenced the exons of all  <dig> genes within the  <dig>  mb mapped region . the coding sequences of all candidate genes were amplified from sc/sc cdna or genomic dna  and compared to the chicken reference genome. we found  <dig> previously unknown snp within an efha <dig> predicted splice site,  <dig> snps within slc7a <dig> predicted to lead to nonsynonymous changes, and a snp in exon  <dig> of fgf <dig> predicted to result in a premature stop codon. we sequenced these changes from the gdna of wt chickens from diverse breeds and found all changes associated with efha <dig> and slc7a <dig> to be carried by most wts sampled , indicating that they are neutral polymorphisms and do not cause the sc/sc phenotype.

we sequenced exon  <dig> of fgf <dig> in  <dig> wt birds of diverse breeds and found that the nonsense mutation   was absent in all of the samples sequenced . we then sequenced exon  <dig> of fgf <dig> in  <dig> sc/sc individuals and  <dig> sc/+ individuals from different sources. all of the sc/sc samples sequenced were homozygous for c.535a > t and all of the sc/+ individuals were heterozygous for the mutation , supporting the idea that fgf <dig> c.535a > t is the sc mutation. the c.535a > t mutation is predicted to lead to the production of a truncated protein lacking  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminus of fgf <dig>  the truncated region is highly conserved across species and encodes motifs associated with receptor interaction and binding of heparan sulphate proteoglycans  .

results from sequencing fgf <dig> exon  <dig> in  <dig> sc/sc individuals,  <dig> sc/+ individuals and  <dig> wt birds. the fgf <dig> c.535a > t mutation was found in all of the sc/sc and none of the wt samples sequenced. the genotype of the two flanking snps  revealed that 25/ <dig> wt individuals were homozygous for the same haplotype as scaleless, indicating that the fgf <dig> c.535a > t mutation does not lie within a rare haplotype.

to confirm that c.535a > t is not a neutral polymorphism present in the wt population we developed a dcaps genotyping assay to discriminate between wt and sc alleles. using our dcaps assay it was possible to discriminate wt, sc/+ and sc/sc individuals . dna from  <dig> wild type chickens from diverse traditional breeds did not carry the c.535a > t mutation . the absence of this mutation from  <dig> wt chromosomes strongly indicates that it is not a neutral polymorphism but is the causative mutation for the scaleless phenotype.

dna was obtained from  <dig> breeds of chicken  <cit>  consisting of individuals from  <dig> or  <dig> flocks to maximise between- and within-breed genetic diversity.

we sought to define the expression pattern of fgf <dig> to confirm its role in feather development. as the sc/sc phenotype is apparent by the 8th day of in ovo development, when feather placodes form in wt embryos but fail to appear in the mutant, the mutated gene must be expressed by this developmental stage. therefore, we performed in situ hybridisation to embryonic day   <dig> wt chicken embryos using a riboprobe specific for fgf <dig>  consistent with a role for fgf <dig> in early feather development, we found that it is expressed in the developing feather placodes . in addition, using qrt-pcr we found that fgf <dig> is expressed exclusively in the epithelial  component of the skin , agreeing with tissue recombination experiments which demonstrated that the gene mutated in sc must be active in the epidermis  <cit> .

discussion
here we report the identification of a nonsense mutation in fgf <dig> in the scaleless chicken line. to identify the sc mutation, we performed a genome-wide snp scan of dna from two pools of blood sampled from individuals homozygous for the mutation, and from heterozygous individuals. the availability of genome sequences has meant that genome- wide association studies  using dense snp arrays have become the method of choice when attempting to map loci associated with specific traits. however, cost presents a major hurdle in the effort to genotype the large number of individuals needed for a reliable gwas. in the early 1990s, several studies demonstrated the use of blood or dna pools in poultry dna profiling  <cit> . more recently, a number of human genetics studies have validated the cost-effectiveness, labour-efficiency and reliability of using dna pools in gwas  <cit> . our results demonstrate that, using a 60 k chicken snp array and dna from two contrasting blood sample pools, a single mutation underlying a qualitative trait can be mapped to within approximately  <dig>  mb. to our knowledge, this is the first report outside the human genetics field describing the use of a snp array to map genes based on genotyping of dna from just two whole blood sample pools.

the fgf gene family comprises  <dig> members encoding secreted signalling molecules with a high affinity for hspg and for specific members of the fgf receptor family  <cit> . compared to other fgf family ligands, fgf <dig> has a broad receptor binding specificity, and can signal via certain splice variants of all  <dig> fgf receptors  <cit> . fgf <dig> has been implicated in diverse developmental and functional processes, though its roles in vertebrate biology have only recently begun to be discovered. early studies indicated an important role for fgf <dig> in development and tumourigenesis, based on its expression profile and mode of regulation  <cit> . more recently, it has been reported that an apparent gain of function allele of fgf <dig> is associated with parkinson's disease and brain structure in human populations  <cit> . in the zebrafish, fin regeneration after injury has been shown to require a functional fgf20a gene, one of the two orthologues of amniote fgf <dig> in the fish genome  <cit> . the phenotype of fgf <dig> null mice remains to be fully described, however it is reported that development of the organ of corti and thus normal hearing is disrupted in this model  <cit> . the work we report here represents the first evidence supporting a role for fgf <dig> in integumentary appendage development. given the similarities between the early stages of feather and hair development  <cit> , fgf <dig> may be involved in mammalian hair placode patterning. assessment of this idea requires detailed analyses of hair follicle development in fgf <dig> null mice, as different hair types in the mouse coat rely on distinct signals for their formation, and often mutant animals display loss or alteration of only one hair type  <cit> .

our findings are in agreement with previous work implicating fgf signalling in feather placode induction. overexpression of dominant negative fgf receptors in embryonic chicken skin explants blocks feather formation  <cit> , while application of recombinant fgf <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> can induce placode formation, even in regions of the skin where placodes do not normally form  <cit> . a study in  <dig> demonstrated the ability of recombinant fgf <dig> to rescue feather placode patterning in ex ovo cultured sc/sc embryonic skin  <cit> . it is likely that the overlapping receptor binding specificities of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  particularly their shared ability to stimulate the mesenchymally expressed c-spliced isoforms of fgf receptors  <cit> , allow this partial rescue of sc/sc skin. this ex ovo rescue study  <cit>  implicated defective fgf signalling as underlying the failure of feather development in sc/sc, though such mutant rescue data should be interpreted cautiously in the absence of genetic evidence, since it is possible that such phenotypic rescues are achieved via a pathway independent or downstream of the primary causative genetic defect. for example, it has been shown that tooth and gland defects in eda mutant mice can be rescued with recombinant fgf <dig> and shh, as well as by recombinant eda itself  <cit> .

this work represents the first genetic evidence supporting a role for fgf signalling in feather development, and complements previous work identifying roles for fgf signalling in the development of mouse  <cit>  and fish  <cit>  ectodermal appendages. our evidence is strengthened by our experiments showing expression of fgf <dig> at the expected developmental stage and in the appropriate tissue layer. in addition, our dcaps test can be used to speed the introgression of the sc mutation into contemporary production lines, by facilitating discrimination between the sc/+ and wt individuals amongst the all-feathered progeny of sc/+ sires mated to wt dams within a backcross breeding scheme.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that scaleless chickens carry a nonsense mutation in fgf <dig> and that this gene is epidermally expressed at an early stage in feather placode development. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of the chicken snp array to map genes based on genotyping of dna from pooled samples of blood. in addition, this work represents the first loss of function genetic evidence supporting a role for fgf signalling in feather development, and identifies fgf <dig> as a previously unrecognised central player. the identification of the sc mutation also uncovers a role for chicken fgf <dig> in the development of scales, spurs and limbs. our work has important implications for the future breeding of this potentially useful line for the poultry industry, and our genotyping assay can facilitate the rapid introgression of this trait into production lines due to its ability to identify sc carriers  in a breeding programme.
