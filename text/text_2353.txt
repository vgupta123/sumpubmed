BACKGROUND
plant growth and development are adaptive to changes in ambient light conditions. light is the energy source of photosynthesis, and is also an important environmental factor for plant growth and development  <cit> . plants can respond to various light parameters including intensity, direction, duration and spectral quality, and modulate the developmental processes accordingly. the light signals are perceived by at least four distinct families of photoreceptors including red /far-red  light-sensing phytochromes, uv-a/blue light-absorbing cryptochromes, phototropins, and uv-b light absorbing uvr <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> .

the economic importance of tomato makes it an attractive target for crop improvement by increasing the disease resistance, nutritional content and productivity by genetic manipulation  <cit> . studies on increase in fruit nutritional value have mostly been carried out through modulation of the expression of structural or regulatory genes of specific pathway  <cit> . the tomato mutants such as hp <dig> and hp <dig> with hypersensitivity to light and elevated pigmentation have been reported  <cit> . it was subsequently shown that hp <dig> and hp <dig> are homologous to ddbi and det <dig>  respectively  <cit> . reduced expression of hp1/ddb <dig> by rnai strategy has been shown to enhance pigmentation in tomato fruits  <cit> . it has been demonstrated further that both hp1/leddb <dig> and hp2/ledet <dig> are essential components of a tomato cul4-based e <dig> ligase complex, where leddb <dig> is associated with tomato cul <dig> and det <dig>  <cit> .

the light signaling components including photoreceptors and central regulators have been shown to have strong potential in crop improvement  <cit> . overexpression of arabidopsis phyb photoreceptor in potato was shown to increase the yield, both in gross weight and in number of tubers  <cit> . four cryptochrome genes have been identified in tomato: two cry <dig> like , one cry <dig> and one cry-dash gene  <cit> . role of cry <dig> includes its importance in seedling photomorphogenesis, anthocyanin accumulation and plant development, however it does not show any effect on flowering time or fruit pigmentation  <cit> . reduced level of cry <dig> in brassica transgenic plants led to increased plant height and lower level accumulation of anthocyanin  <cit> . tomato cry <dig> possesses similar but distinct functions in arabidopsis. overexpression of cry <dig> in tomato transgenic plants display short hypocotyl and reduced internode distance, overproduction of anthocyanin and chlorophyll in leaves, and of flavonoids and lycopene in fruits  <cit> . it also shows strong effect on the expression of stress related gene products in response to diurnal cues  <cit> . tomato cry-dash is expressed at early stages of tomato development and contributes significantly in the control of circadian machinery with a light regulated transcription  <cit> . two light signaling components in tomato, lecop1like and lehy <dig>  which antagonistically regulate the fruit pigmentation, have been identified  <cit> . rnai-mediated down-regulation of det <dig> and lecop1like resulted in increased carotenoid levels in tomato fruits  <cit> .

arabidopsis myc <dig> is a bhlh transcription factor that works downstream to cry <dig> and cry <dig> photoreceptors  <cit> . myc <dig> acts as a point of crosstalk among multiple signaling pathways such as light, aba, ja and ethylene-jasmonate  <cit> . although the function of myc <dig> has been mainly investigated in arabidopsis, atmyc <dig> orthologs/homologs that have been characterized from other monocots or dicot plants have recently been reported. the recent reports from dicots have implied a broadly conserved role of myc <dig> with context to its function in ja signaling pathways  <cit> . tcjamyc, the homolog of atmyc <dig>  is a key candidate gene to increase paclitaxel  accumulation in taxuscell cultures  <cit> . three atmyc <dig> orthologs, nbbhlh <dig> and nbbhlh <dig> from nicotiana benthamiana and ntmyc <dig> from nicotiana tabacum, have been shown to regulate the expression of nicotine biosynthesis genes in the roots  <cit> . crmyc <dig>  a myc <dig> ortholog from catharanthus roseus, regulates the ja responsiveness of genes involved in the regulation of alkaloid biosynthesis  <cit> . two myc <dig> orthologs, mamyc2a and mamyc2b, in the regulation of ja-induced chilling tolerance in banana  fruit have been reported  <cit> . a recent study in maize  implicated myc <dig>  a putative myc <dig> ortholog, in systemic signaling activation in response to insect elicitors  <cit> . however, the functional role of myc <dig> in growth and development is practically unknown in crop plants  <cit> . here, we have carried out the functional analysis of lemyc <dig> using transgenic tomato plants. our results suggest that lemyc <dig> acts as a negative regulator of blue light–mediated photomorphogenic growth.

RESULTS
lemyc <dig> acts as a negative regulator of blue light mediated seedling development
arabidopsis zbf1/myc <dig> has been shown to work as a repressor of cryptochrome-mediated blue light  signaling  <cit> . to determine the function of myc <dig> in growth and development in crop plants, we cloned lemyc2/zbf1from tomato  by reverse transcriptase-pcr. the coding sequence of lemyc <dig> cdna appeared to be a full-length cdna  encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids  with a bhlh domain. the amino acid sequence of lemyc <dig> has 93%, 66% and 53% identity to jamyc <dig> , crmyc <dig>  and atmyc <dig> , respectively  <cit>  .

to determine the physiological function of lemyc <dig> in light-controlled seedling development,  <dig> tomato  transgenic lines overexpressing lemyc <dig>   <dig> transgenic lines under-expressing lemyc <dig>  and  <dig> vector control transgenic plants were generated. these independent lines were allowed to self-fertilize and the t <dig> seeds were collected for further studies. since arabidopsis atmyc <dig> null mutants display relatively weak phenotype in photomorphogenic growth  <cit> , two overexpresser lines  with highest level of lemyc <dig>  and two rnai lines  with maximum down-regulation of lemyc <dig> transcript were selected in this study for further analysis. analyses of lemyc <dig> transcript and protein levels in oe <dig> and oe <dig> transgenic lines showed higher level of transcript and protein accumulation as compared to control transgenic plants . the rnai transgenic lines including ri <dig> and ri <dig> showed reduced accumulation of lemyc <dig> transcript and higher-level accumulation of lemyc <dig> sirna .

to determine the possible role of lemyc <dig> in tomato seedling development, we examined the morphology of 6-day-old lemyc <dig> overexpresser and rnai transgenic seedlings grown in dark, white light  and at specific wavelengths of light. as shown in figure 1e and i, no morphological difference was observed between control and lemyc <dig> transgenic seedlings in the darkness. however, lemyc <dig> transgenic seedlings displayed altered hypocotyl length in wl irradiation. whereas the overexpresser transgenic seedlings showed reduced sensitivity, the rnai transgenic seedlings displayed hypersensitive response with shorter hypocotyl especially at lower fluences  of wl . this altered hypocotyl length however was not observed at higher fluences  of wl . whereas enhanced inhibition in hypocotyl elongation of rnai seedlings was observed in bl, the overexpresser transgenic seedlings displayed elongated hypocotyl as compared to control seedlings . while examined the hypocotyl length in red  or far red light  grown seedlings, no significant difference was observed between transgenic and control seedlings . taken together these results suggest that lemyc <dig> acts as a negative regulator of bl-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. these results further indicate that although myc <dig> does not play the negative regulatory role in wl-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in arabidopsis  <cit> , lemyc <dig> works as a negative regulator of wl-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation at lower fluences of wl.

down regulation of lemyc <dig> leads to higher level of chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation, and light regulated gene expression
two important physiological responses, accumulation of anthocyanin and chlorophyll, are regulated by light signaling pathways. to determine the possible role of lemyc <dig> on chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation, we measured the level of chlorophyll and anthocyanin in overexpresser and rnai transgenic tomato seedlings. as shown in figure 2a, the level of chlorophyll remained similar in control and transgenic seedlings in wl. however, the chlorophyll accumulation was strongly reduced in overexpresser transgenic lines, and showed elevated level of accumulation in rnai lines in bl . on the other hand, although no significant difference was observed in the accumulation of anthocyanin in overexpresser transgenic lines in bl, the level of accumulation was significantly higher in rnai transgenic lines as compared to vector control plants . taken together, these results indicate that lemyc <dig> acts as a negative regulator of chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation in bl.

since lemyc <dig> acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenic growth in bl, we ask whether the expression of light inducible genes such as cab and rbcs are modulated by bhlh transcription factor, lemyc <dig>  to test this, we performed quantitative real time pcr of 6-day-old seedlings grown in bl and steady state mrna level of light inducible genes was estimated. the expression of lecab <dig> and lerbcs-3a was increased in lemyc <dig> rnai transgenic lines, and the level of expression was compromised in overexpresser transgenic seedlings as compared to control plants in bl .

to further examine the bl-mediated induction of lecab1and lerbc-3a expression, 5-day-old transgenic seedlings grown in darkness were transferred to bl for 2 h and 4 h, and the transcript levels were measured. the level of induction of lecab <dig> and lerbcs-3a was elevated in rnai transgenic lines as compared to wild-type and overexpresser seedlings at various time points. whereas about 6-fold induction in rbcs-3a expression was found in rnai lines at 4 h, less than 4-fold and 3-fold induction was detected in the wild type and overexpresser backgrounds, respectively . in the case of lecab <dig>  the differential expression between the overexpresser and rnai transgenic lines was not observed after exposure to bl for 2 h . however, an approximately 60-fold induction was detected in both wild type and rnai lines, whereas the level of induction was reduced to less than 40-fold in the overexpresser transgenic background at 4 h . taken together, these results suggest that lemyc <dig> plays a negative regulatory role in the bl-mediated expression of lecab <dig> and lerbcs-3a.

lemyc <dig> specifically binds to the g-box of lerbcs-3a promoter
to determine whether lemyc <dig> is able to work as a transcription factor, we investigated the interaction of lemyc <dig> with the g-box present in lerbcs-3a minimal promoter. we used purified glutathione s-transferase-lemyc <dig>  fusion protein and 147 bp promoter fragment containing the g-box of lerbcs3a for gel shift assays. as shown in figure 2h, whereas gst alone did not show any binding activity , strong low mobility dna-protein complexes were formed with gst-lemyc <dig> fusion protein . this dna-protein complexes were efficiently competed out by  <dig> and  <dig> molar excess of unlabelled g-box  but not with  <dig> and  <dig> molar excess of mutated g-box, mg . taken together, these results suggest that lemyc <dig> specifically interacts with the g-box of lerbcs-3a minimal promoter.

lemyc <dig> positively regulates the root growth in tomato plants
arabidopsis atmyc <dig> mutant plants develop significantly less number of lateral roots and exhibit short stature as compared to corresponding wild-type background  <cit> . we ask whether altered level of lemyc <dig> leads to altered root morphology in tomato transgenic plants. examination of root growth of 14-days old lemyc <dig> rnai transgenic plants revealed that the transgenic lines developed less number of lateral roots as compared to vector control plants . higher level of lemyc <dig> protein in overexpresser transgenic plants led to formation of more lateral roots in comparison to control plants . although arabidopsis atmyc <dig> mutants do not show any altered root length, the lemyc <dig> overexpresser transgenic plants showed drastically longer root, and the root length was significantly compromised in rnai transgenic lines as compared to corresponding vector control plants . collectively, these results suggest that lemyc <dig> positively regulates the lateral root formation and root length.

overexpression of lemyc <dig> leads to more branches with reduced internode distance
in arabidopsis, atmyc <dig> mutant adult plants display short stature as compared to wild-type control plants  <cit> . to investigate the role of lemyc <dig> at the adult stage, phenotype of about three months old green house plants was examined. no significant change in height was detected in rnai or overexpression tomato transgenic plants as compared to control plants . lemyc <dig> rnai transgenic plants however showed less number of branches, while overexpresser lines were branched with about twice as many branches as vector control plants . the internode distance of the overexpresser transgenic plants was significantly reduced as compared to control plants, whereas it was drastically increased in the rnai transgenic plants . these results, taken together, suggest that lemyc <dig> promotes formation of branches in tomato plants.

to determine whether the number of seeds per tomato fruit was altered in transgenic plants, we examined the number of seeds in ripe fruits from various transgenic and control plants. although overexpresser or rnai transgenic plants produced viable seeds, almost all of the seeds in the fruits of rnai transgenic lines were smaller in size than the control plants. on the contrary, the size of the seeds in overexpresser transgenic lines was larger than the control plants .

altered level of lemyc <dig> expression modulates aba and ja responsiveness
arabidopsis myc <dig> acts as a point of crosstalk in multiple signaling pathways including light, abscisic acid  and jasmonic acid   <cit> . to determine aba mediated induction of lemyc <dig> expression, 6-day-old tomato seedlings were treated with aba and the level of lemyc <dig> transcript level was monitored. the expression of lemyc <dig> was induced by aba and the level of induction increased with higher concentration of aba treatment . to determine whether down-regulation of lemyc <dig> is able to alter the aba responsiveness in transgenic tomato plants, freshly harvested seeds of overexpresser and rnai transgenic lines were plated on ms plates without or with aba. in the absence of aba, the rate of germination of seeds in various lines was found to be similar . however, 5 μm of aba reduced the rate of seed germination of control plants, and the effect was more severe in overexpresser transgenic lines . on the other hand, down-regulation of lemyc <dig> in rnai lines led to significantly less sensitivity to aba with higher rate of seed germination . these results indicate that lemyc <dig> positively regulates aba-mediated inhibition of seed germination. we then monitored the expression of aba responsive genes in lemyc <dig> transgenic lines. the expression of areb, pp2c and tas <dig> <cit>  was significantly reduced in lemyc <dig> rnai transgenic lines as compared to control plants in the presence of aba. furthermore, the level of expression of these genes was significantly increased in lemyc <dig> overexpresser transgenic background . these results suggest that lemyc <dig> positively regulates the expression of aba responsive genes such as areb, pp2c and tas <dig> 

among plethora of functions of ja in plant growth and development, one is the inhibition of root growth. to investigate the ja responsiveness of lemyc <dig> transgenic plants, we grew the plants in the presence of ja and monitored the root growth. ja caused root growth retardation with reduced length and number of lateral roots formed in control and overexpresser transgenic plants . the effect was more severe in the overexpresser transgenic lines than the vector control plants . on the other hand, the effect of ja-mediated inhibition of root growth was drastically reduced in lemyc <dig> rnai plants . these results altogether indicate that lemyc <dig> acts as a positive regulator of ja-mediated inhibition of root growth. we then monitored the expression of ja responsive genes, lin <dig> and pin <dig>  in lemyc <dig> transgenic lines  <cit> . as shown in figure 6d-e, ja treatment induced the expression of lin <dig> and pin <dig> genes in vector control plants, and the level of expression was significantly higher in lemyc <dig> overexpresser transgenic plants. the level of induction of lin <dig> and pin <dig> expression was however drastically reduced in rnai transgenic lines . these results suggest that lemyc <dig> promotes ja-induced expression of lin <dig> and pin <dig> 

discussion
the function of myc <dig> has mainly been studied in arabidopsis thus far  <cit> . in recent years, the functional homologs of myc <dig> have been identified from other dicot and also monocot plants. emerging evidences from other plant species suggest that myc <dig> functions are broadly conserved in ja signaling pathways  <cit> . however, the possible role of myc <dig> in plant growth and development remained unknown besides arabidopsis  <cit> . this study reveals that the reduced level of lemyc <dig> leads to hyperphotomorphogenic growth with shorter hypocotyl, whereas the higher level of lemyc <dig> results in elongated hypocotyl as compared to wild type backgrounds. the expression of light regulated genes such as lerbcs-3a and lecab <dig> was also found to be up-regulated in rnai and down-regulated in lemyc <dig> overexpresser transgenic lines. therefore, this study demonstrates that lemyc <dig> works as a negative regulator of photomorphogenic growth and light regulated gene expression, and establishes the role of lemyc <dig> in seedling development in tomato. it should be noted that although transgenic lines with similar level of lemyc <dig> were chosen for this study, as shown in figure  <dig>  the level of lemyc <dig> is not identical in the overexpresser lines. this slight alteration in the regulatory protein, lemyc <dig>  level in transgenic lines might have attributed to significant changes in the target gene expression.

the analyses of growth of transgenic seedlings overexpressing lemyc <dig> or rnai lines revealed that lemyc <dig> predominantly works in bl-mediated seedling development. altered level of chlorophyll and anthocyanin accumulation was also observed in the transgenic seedlings in bl. the function of lemyc <dig>  as observed from the phenotypic analysis of seedlings, remains confined to the lower fluences  of wl without any significant change in chlorophyll accumulation. on the other hand, the overexpresser or rnai transgenic lines of lemyc <dig> grown at higher fluences  of wl in the green house exhibited strong phenotypic changes at the adult stage. it is worth mentioning here that although arabidopsis atmyc <dig> mutant seedlings do not exhibit morphological defects in wl, the adult plants display short stature with delayed flowering time in wl  <cit> . the adult transgenic tomato plants, including overexpresser and rnai lines, in this study, did not display short stature. however, the lemyc <dig> overexpresser transgenic plants grew with more branches with reduced internode distance, and the rnai lines showed opposite phenotype. it has been shown earlier that overexpression of cry <dig> photoreceptor in tomato transgenic plants leads to dwarf phenotype with reduced internode distance  <cit> . arabidopsis myc <dig>  the repressor of bl-mediated photomorphogenic growth, has been shown to work downstream to cry <dig> and cry <dig> photoreceptors  <cit> . in this study, it is observed that lemyc <dig> overexpresser transgenic lines have increased number of branches with reduced internode distance. in addition to light, aba and ja are also involved in plant growth and development  <cit> . thus the plausible explanation of such observation could be attributed to the regulatory function of myc <dig> in multiple signaling pathways including light, aba and ja.

although the fruit size remains the same, alteration in the seed size is observed in the lemyc <dig> overexpresser and rnai transgenic lines. whereas the seed size is increased in the lemyc <dig> overexpresser lines, it has been drastically reduced in the rnai lines as compared to the control plants. alteration in seed size has been reported with posttranslational silencing of invinh <dig>  an inhibitor of a cell wall invertase  <cit> . the microarray studies using arabidopsis atmyc <dig> mutants have shown that myc <dig> controls the regulation of expression of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. lemyc <dig> overexpression in tomato increases anthocyanin levels, which is reminiscent of the tomato high pigment mutants hp1and hp <dig>  which display increased anthocyanin accumulation and shortened hypocotyl and internodes  <cit> .

negative regulators of photomorphogenesis such as cop <dig>  shw <dig> and myc <dig> act as positive regulators of lateral root formation without any effect on root length  <cit> . this study shows that in addition to lateral root formation, lemyc <dig> also promotes the root length of tomato plants. the light-regulated gene expression studies reveal that lemyc <dig> represses the expression of cab and rbcs genes. the light-mediated induction kinetics demonstrates that lerbcs-3a expression is significantly higher in the dark grown seedlings in rani transgenic lines. thus, although lemyc <dig> transgenic lines do not show any altered morphology in the dark, lemyc <dig> plays a negative regulatory role in the expression of lerbcs-3a in the darkness. the dna-protein interaction studies reveal that lemyc <dig> is able to bind to the g-box of lerbcs-3a promoter. interestingly, two protein-dna complexes are detected that are equally completed out with excess unlabeled g-box, however not with the mutated version of the g-box. myc <dig> in arabidopsis acts as a transcriptional regulator in aba and ja signaling pathways in arabidopsis  <cit> . the aba and ja responsiveness of lemyc <dig> transgenic lines demonstrate that rnai transgenic lines are less sensitive to aba and ja mediated inhibition of seed germination and root growth, respectively. the effect of higher level of lemyc <dig> was comparatively less than the reduced level  both in aba or ja responsiveness.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the functions of myc <dig> in light, aba and ja signaling pathways in tomato. our data suggest that lemyc <dig> is an important regulator of growth and development from seedling to flowering plants. the observations made in this work highlight strong biotechnological potential of lemyc <dig> in crop improvement.
