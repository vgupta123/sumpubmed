BACKGROUND
the sesame  is a member of the family pedaliaceae and order lamiales  <cit>  and is a diploid species with  <dig> pairs of chromosomes . in our previous study, the sesame genome was estimated to be approximately 357 mb in size based on de novo sequencing of zhongzhi no.  <dig>  the assembled genome  was predicted to contain  <dig>  protein-coding genes. the version  <dig>  assembly anchored  <dig> scaffolds into  <dig> pseudomolecules that harbored  <dig>  % of the assembled genome and  <dig>  % of the predicted genes  <cit> . we attempted to anchor additional scaffolds and contigs to improve the sesame genome assembly and equalize the number of sesame chromosomes. to achieve this goal, a high-quality and dense genetic map is essential. although two sesame genetic maps have been published  <cit> , they contain more than  <dig> linkage groups. the numbers of breeding lines and temporary populations usually contribute to the construction of genetic maps  <cit> .

genetic maps are useful for discovering, dissecting, and manipulating the genes responsible for simple and complex traits in crop plants  <cit> . a high-quality genetic map not only improves genome assembly but also provides a foundation for mapping the genes or quantitative trait loci  that underlie agronomic traits of important oil crops such as the sesame. the sesame seed is useful because of its high oil content and quality. the sesame antioxidative furofuran lignans such as sesamin, are the focus of research in medicine and pharmacology due to their potent pharmacological properties including the ability to decrease blood lipid  <cit>  and cholesterol  <cit>  levels. moreover, the diploid characteristic, high oil content, small genome size, and smaller number of lipid-related genes distinguish sesame from other polyploid oil crops such as soybean, peanut, and rapeseed and make it a valuable plant model to study oil biosynthesis and various traits  <cit> . despite the importance and long history of cultivation of the sesame, few gene loci have been fine-mapped due to a lack of genetic and genomic studies and gene cloning and functional analyses.

plant architecture is crucial for the grain yield and is determined by the plant height  and other traits  <cit> . the “green revolution” was characterized by breeding semi-dwarf or dwarf wheat and rice cultivars to achieve an increased harvest index and improved adaption to the irrigated and fertile environments usually inhabited by taller plants . sesame has a low yield capacity compared to other crop plants due to its high ph, low harvest index, and susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stressors  <cit> . mutant sesame lines with a determinate growth habit have been generated to reduce the sesame ph. unfortunately, this characteristic was linked to short fruiting zone length and low yield  <cit>  phenotypes; thus, new dwarf or semi-dwarf sesame genetic resources must be explored.

another important sesame trait is the seed coat color which varies widely from white to black. black sesame seeds are favored as food and medication in asia, whereas white sesame seeds are primarily used to produce oil. some studies have shown that white sesame seeds typically have higher sesamin or sesamolin content  <cit> , whereas black sesame seeds usually have higher ash and carbohydrate content and lower protein, oil, and moisture ratios  <cit> .

single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most abundant small-scale form of genetic variation in humans and plants and snp markers have become increasingly important tools for molecular genetic analyses  <cit> . restriction-site associated dna sequencing  using next generation sequencing platforms reduces the representation of the genome and allows oversequencing of the nucleotides adjacent to restriction sites; thus, it is a relatively cost-effective and precise method for the detection of snps  <cit> . in this study, we constructed a recombinant inbred line  population consisting of  <dig> lines using a newly discovered semi-dwarf sesame strain. a new high-density sesame genetic map with  <dig> linkage groups was prepared using rad-seq which enabled us to update the sesame genome assembly to a new level and to finely map important agronomic traits such as the ph and seed coat color.

RESULTS
construction of a new sesame genetic map
we rad sequenced the  <dig> rils and the two parental lines and generated more than  <dig>  ×  <dig> paired-end reads. each line produced a mean of  <dig>  mb of high-quality sequence data. all reads were aligned with the zhongzi no.  <dig> scaffold sequence which has a total effective genome length of 274 mb based on analysis using bwa software  <cit> , and  <dig>  % of the reads were mapped onto reference sequences across the various lines. approximately  <dig>  % of the reference genome was tagged by rad-seq, with a mean value of  <dig> -fold coverage.

the tags from the two parents zhongzhi no.  <dig> and zzm <dig> were subjected to comparative analysis to detect snps. after filtering out poor snps and those with a significantly distorted segregation ratio ,  <dig>  snps were retained for genotyping of the ril population. due to the limitation of markernumbers that can be analyzed in joinmap software, a portion of the snps was selected to construct the primary genetic map. based on the primary genetic map, we rearranged the scaffolds from the previous genome assembly and generated a new sesame genome sequence. then, a bin map was constructed by joining the consecutive intervals on the genome that lacked a recombination event within the population  <cit> . the genetic map included  <dig>  bins that could be grouped into  <dig> sesame linkage groups  with a total length of  <dig>  cm . this is the first sesame genetic map in which the number of linkage groups equals the number of chromosome pairs in a sesame cultivar. the lengths of the  <dig> linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm . each linkage group had  <dig>  to  <dig>  bins resulting in a mean interval distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent bins . the bin distance was similar to that generated by rad-seq   <cit> , but was shorter than that maps constructed using randomly selective amplification markers mainly   <cit>  or the specific length amplified fragment sequencing  technology   <cit> . furthermore, more than 99 % of the interval distances between adjacent bins were shorter than 6 cm , indicating the high density of the new sesame genetic map.fig.  <dig> high density genetic map of the sesame genome and the mapped qtls. positions of the mapped qtls for plant height , capsule zone length , height of the first capsule-bearing node , internode length , node number , and tip length without the capsule . the seed coat color space l*, a*, and b* values are indicated with colored rectangles centered at the peak of each qtl



update of sesame genome assembly
the previous de novo sesame assembly provided a total genome assembly of 274 mb with a scaffold n <dig> of  <dig>  mb and  <dig> scaffolds greater than 150 kb in size. the assembly anchored  <dig> larger scaffolds into  <dig> pseudomolecules based on a genetic map that included  <dig> markers, which harbored  <dig>  % of the total genome assembly and  <dig>  % of the predicted genes   <cit> . using the genetic map constructed in this study, we anchored another  <dig> scaffolds or contigs in a new sesame genome assembly  and linked together six smaller linkage groups in version  <dig>  .

despite the addition of  <dig> new scaffolds to the new version of the genome assembly, their orders were relatively consistent with the orders of the  <dig> scaffolds of version  <dig> . in total,  <dig> changes occurred during the re-anchoring, including  <dig> scaffolds that were adjusted in the same pseudomolecules,  <dig> scaffolds that were relocated to other pseudomolecules, and  <dig> scaffolds that were split into two parts and relocated separately . the inconsistency might be due to a single misassembly in which contig sequences were erroneously joined into these scaffolds through paired-end links during the initial assembly as reported for cucumis melo  <cit> .fig.  <dig> anchored scaffolds in the current and previously assembled sesame genomes. green scaffolds indicate anchored scaffolds that are consistent in the current  and previously  assembled genomes. their relative positions are marked with lines. the newly anchored scaffolds in assembly version  <dig>  are highlighted in red. the split scaffolds and relocated scaffolds are indicated in blue. the positions of the six smaller linkage groups in version  <dig>   were indicated with pink lines



as a result,  <dig> scaffolds, were anchored to  <dig> pseudomolecules , which were defined as pseudochromosomes and designated as chr <dig> to chr <dig> . the lengths of the  <dig> anchored scaffolds ranged from 325 bp to  <dig>  mb ,  <dig>  % of the scaffolds with lengths greater than 150 kb in version  <dig>  were included in the new assembly version. the total length of the assembled pseudomolecules in the new version increased the assembly from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, representing  <dig>  % of the genome assembly, and  <dig>  % of the predicted gene models were anchored successfully .table  <dig> comparison of the anchored sesame genome versions  <dig>  and  <dig>

there were  <dig> scaffolds  with lengths greater than 150 kb that were still missing in the  <dig> newly assembled pseudomolecules. these sequences may represent conserved regions with few mutation sites or lower frequencies of exchange during chromosome recombination. other high-density genetic maps based on new mapping populations or fluorescence in situ hybridization  may be required to anchor the remaining scaffold and to make the map more perfect. the mean sesame whole-genome recombination rate  was  <dig> ; the rate ranged from  <dig>  for chr <dig> to  <dig>  for chr <dig>  comparison of the physical and genetic distances between markers revealed that most of the slgs contained a low recombination region located approximately 5 mb from the proximal end or center .

qtls for traits related to sesame ph
the sesame plant height is generally determined by the height of the first capsule-bearing node , capsule zone length , and tip length without the capsule  traits. the czl is also related to the node number  and internode length  traits. the mature zhongzhi no.  <dig> plants are normally greater than  <dig>  m in height, whereas zzm <dig> is a semi-dwarf cultivar which grows to less than  <dig>  m. additionally, the two parents exhibited obvious differences in other traits related to ph . among the  <dig> progeny lines, the values for ph, hfc, czl, tl, il and nn were  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>  , 0– <dig>  ,  <dig> – <dig>   and  <dig> – <dig> , respectively . ph, hfc, and il fluctuated less than the other traits based on the coefficient of variation  across the three field trials, and higher broad-sense heritabilities were also observed . positive and negative transgressive segregation was observed in the ril population suggesting that a germplasm could be created with the expected ph, czl, tl, nn, and il traits independent of environmental effects; however, the negative heterobeltiosis of hfc appeared to depend largely on the environment. ph was correlated with hfc, czl, tl, nn, and il , and strong correlations were observed between ph and hfc and between czl and nn . interestingly, the correlation between nn and il was negative across the three trial sites. this result supported the hypothesis that dwarf sesame cultivars could be bred without the loss of yield because reducing the internode length did not appear to affect the capsule node number.fig.  <dig> characteristics of sesame plant height and seed coat color. a correlations between sesame plant height and related traits across three trial sites. ph, plant height; czl, capsule zone length; hfc, height of the first capsule-bearing node; il, internode length; nn, node number; tl, tip length without the capsule; wc, wuchang field trial location; py, pingyu field trial location; yl, yangluo field trial location. the size and color of the ovals mirrored the correlation coefficient given in the lower triangle or ovals. b variation in seed coat color in the ril population. subpanels  <dig> and  <dig> represent the seeds of the parental lines zhongzhi no.  <dig> and zzm <dig>  and the other panels represent the separation of the seed coat color in the population



using the bin map, we identified qtls underlying the sesame ph and the related traits hfc, czl, tl, nn, and il. phenotypic datasets from the three experimental environments were coupled with the genotypic data using windows qtl cartographer  <dig>  software  <cit> . the threshold used for the lod scores to evaluate the statistical significance of the qtl effects was determined using  <dig>  permutations. in total,  <dig> qtls in nine slgs were detected for the traits with contribution rates of 3–24 % . among them,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> qtls were detected in three, two, and one environment, respectively. these loci were not distributed randomly because slg <dig>  slg <dig>  slg <dig>  and slg <dig> together contained more than 78 % of the qtls .table  <dig> significant qtls* associated with sesame plant height and the seed coat color space

ten qtls accounting for  <dig> – <dig>  % of the ph variation were detected. four of these qtls  individually explained more than 10 % of the phenotypic variation . we also detected eight hfc, eight czl, and six tl qtls. of them, three of the hfc qtls  and one czl qtl  were found to contribute more than 10 % of the phenotype variation at a minimum of two sites. tl might be easily affected by the environment because all of the tl qtls were detected in only one or two of the three trial sites. although five qtls were detected for nn, none of them had a phenotype explanation rate of more than 10 %. nevertheless, the qnn- <dig>  locus accounted for approximately 9 % of nn and had a pleiotropic effect on czl  with a contribution rate of  <dig>  %.

we also identified loci with pleiotropic effects in other qtls based on their close or identical locations, particularly in qtls with higher contribution rates. the qph- <dig>  and qph- <dig>  qtls were the two major loci that accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the sesame ph variation, respectively. the qph- <dig>  locus was derived from the tall parent with a positive effect of  <dig>  % and was located between bin markers slg8_bin <dig> and slg8_bin <dig> in a 350-kb region. this region also contained three other qtls  that accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation in hfc, czl, and il, respectively. the qph- <dig>  locus was located in a 928-kb region between bin <dig> and bin <dig> on slg <dig>  this region also contained three other qtls  that accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation in hfc, czl, and nn, respectively. the negative additive effects of these qtls indicated that the zzm <dig> semi-dwarf parent contributes to a strong decrease in the sesame ph and related traits including hfc, czl, and nn.

plant height usually decides the plant architecture and contributes to the crop yield. studies based on mutants with dwarf phenotypes had showed that plant hormones such as gibberellin , auxin, cytokinin , and brassinosteroid  played important roles in determining stem elongation  <cit> . in sesame, few studies have reported the locus or gene that encodes plant height; the exception is wu et al. <cit> , who he detected two qtl with contribution rate no more than  <dig>  however, the relationships of these qtls were not clear for the inconsistent genetic maps and no sesame reference genomes available for the previous study. we predicted  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes for the flanking bin-marker regions of qph- <dig>  and qph- <dig> , respectively, on the new assembled pseudomolecule chromosome according to the true confidence intervals . annotation of these genes showed some of them may function in regulating of plant height. for example, sin_ <dig> in the site of qph- <dig>  site was predicted to encode an auxin-induced protein and sin_ <dig> encoded a brassinosteroid-insensitive protein. further study in the future may be expected to verify their functions.

qtl for sesame seed coat color
the two parents zhongzhi no.  <dig> and zzm <dig> were also distinguishable by seed coat color; the seeds of the former were white and the seeds of the latter were black . genetic analysis showed that black was dominant to white in sesame seed coat color. the black seed coat color was characterized by delayed inheritance or predetermination because the f <dig> seeds  produced from a cross between white and black seed sesame plants were always black. the rils exhibited wide variations in seed coat color. the l*, a*, and b* values for the zhongzhi no.  <dig> seed coat color were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, whereas those for zzm <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the l* values for the  <dig> rils ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and the a* and b* values ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively . because “l*” represents brightness ranging from black to white, “a*” represents red and “b*” represents yellow for positive values  <cit> , the measured values and distributions suggest that black, white, and yellow are predominant in the sesame seed coat color space, which is consistent with the observation that the seed coat color segregates in the rils.

across the pingyu  and yangluo  field trial locations, three qtls  were detected repeatedly for the l* color space and made a cumulative contribution of 80 % to the phenotype. among them, qscl- <dig>  explained approximately  <dig>  % of the l* variation and was located at  <dig>  cm on the slg <dig> linkage group. this locus was flanked by the adjacent slg8_bin <dig>  and slg8_bin <dig>  bin markers that covered a  <dig> -mb region on pseudochromosome chr <dig>  the qscl- <dig>  locus was located in a  <dig> -kb region on pseudochromosome chr <dig> between the bin markers slg4_bin <dig>  and slg4_bin <dig>  and contributed  <dig>  % of the l* variation. the qscl- <dig>  locus was located at the top of pseudochromosome chr <dig> in a  <dig> -kb region between bin markers slg11_bin <dig>  and slg11_bin <dig>  and explained  <dig>  % of the l* variation. there two qtls  contributed  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the color space a* value detected across the py and yl field trial locations, respectively. locus qsca- <dig>  was detected only at py with a phenotype explanation rate of  <dig>  %. three qtls  were detected for the color space b* across both locations with a total contribution rate of 64 %. the high contribution rate of the seed coat color locus to phenotype was also reported by zhang et al., and he detected four qtl with contribution rates ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %  <cit> . however, because the loci in the study of zhang et al. were mainly located with aflp markers in an independent genetic map, it is difficult to determine the relationship of the present loci to them.

of the qtls described above, qscl- <dig> , qsca- <dig> , and qscb- <dig>  were located in the same region on pseudochromosome chr <dig>  the qscl- <dig> , qscb- <dig>  and qsca- <dig>  qtls were located in the same region on pseudochromosome chr <dig>  and qscl- <dig>  and qscb- <dig>  were located in the same region on pseudochromosome chr11; thus, the three sites were pleiotropic for the sesame seed coat color. in other words, only  <dig> loci were detected here. in contrast, the intricate manifestation of seed coat color has been acknowledged to be due to the involvement of various pigments including flavonols, proanthocyanidin , and possibly other phenolic relatives such as lignin and melanin  <cit> . polyphenol oxidase  was reported to participate in the oxidation step in proanthocyanidin, lignin, and melanin biosynthesis, resulting in a dark seed coat color  <cit> . some genes encoding the enzymes participating in flavonoid biosynthesis have been cloned from arabidopsis  <cit> , grape  <cit> , and soybean  <cit> . we checked the two sites of qscl- <dig>  and qscl- <dig>  with higher explanation rates  and found that the gene that encoded ppo , which was reported to account for the black color of the sesame seed coat, was also located at qscl- <dig>   <cit> . for site qscl- <dig> , a gene  belonging to the cytochrome family that contained a ferredoxin reductase-type fad-binding domain and flavoprotein transmembrane component was identified; this gene may contribute to the seed coat color  <cit> . these results also highlight the availability of the genome assembly.

CONCLUSIONS
no previously reported sesame genetic map has contained the same number of linkage groups as the number of chromosomes. the high number of linkage groups  has caused confusion in the numbering of linkage groups and the assembled pseudomolecules in various studies. the present study brought the total number of assembled pseudomolecules equals the chromosome number of sesamum indicum, and that  <dig>  % of the de novo assembly and  <dig>  % of the predicted gene models were anchored successfully. thus, the number of sesame pseudochromosomes is fixed, which is important and helpful for comparative genomics and genetics studies such as sesame genome resequencing, marker development, genetic map integration, gene mapping, allele analysis, and evolutionary analyses.

we provide a high-density sesame bin map containing  <dig>  bins spanning  <dig>  cm. the map covers the entire assembled genome and is useful for mapping qtls or genes. aside from the investigation of traits important for breeding sesame cultivars, such as indehiscent capsule, definite growth habit, ph, and seed coat color  <cit> , few agronomic traits have been studied in the sesame. the present study not only mapped  <dig> qtls for sesame ph and related traits but also detected nine qtls for sesame seed coat color. in particular, two major qtls  associated with ph were located in a 350-kb region on chr <dig> and in a 928-kb region on chr <dig>  respectively. we identified  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes, respectively, in the two regions for future study. notably, the qph- <dig>  locus is predicted to be responsible for the semi-dwarf sesame plant phenotype. this is the first report of a sesame semi-dwarf locus that can be used in an architectural study of sesame. the major qscl- <dig>  pleiotropic seed coat color locus for the l*, a*, and b* color space values was located on chr <dig> in a  <dig> -mb region. another major locus qscb- <dig>  located on chr <dig> in a  <dig> -kb region contributed 39 % to the b* values and contained  <dig> candidate genes. collectively, the combination of the high-density genetic map and the sesame genome assembly update will serve as an essential platform for future comparative genomics and genetic studies.
