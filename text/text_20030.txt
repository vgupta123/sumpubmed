BACKGROUND
auxin, the most ubiquitous phytohormone in plants, is involved in various biological processes, such as organ development, fruit ripening, responses to environmental stimuli and phototropism  <cit> . at an early stage in auxin signal transduction, several gene families, including aux/iaa , gh <dig>  and saur , respond to auxin treatments  <cit> . the aux/iaa genes represent a classical auxin-responsive gene family that are mostly rapidly induced by auxin  <cit> . the first aux/iaa family member was isolated in soybean and then was identified in many different plant species . as an important component of the auxin signaling pathway, aux/iaa proteins are involved in the expression regulation of a large number genes downstream of auxin signaling through the release of auxin response factors   <cit> .

most of the aux/iaa proteins contain four conserved domains, i, ii, iii and iv  <cit> . briefly, domain i is a repressor domain that contains a leucine repeat motif   <cit> . recent studies found that the topless  protein mediates auxin-dependent transcriptional repression by interacting with domain i of an aux/iaa protein  <cit> . domain ii is a key component responsible for the instability of aux/iaa proteins and is recognized by the ubiquitin-proteasome protein  degradation pathway. domains iii and iv are the binding sites for the formation of aux/iaa-arf hetero-dimerization  <cit> .

due to the functional redundancy among family members, phenotypes associated with a loss of function in aux/iaa genes are scarce. based on the characterizations of gain-of-function mutants in model plants, the diverse roles of aux/iaas in plants have been well elucidated. in arabidopsis, the iaa16- <dig> mutation, a dominant gain-of-function mutation in iaa <dig>  reduces the sensitivity to both auxin and abscisic acid   <cit> . domain ii mutations in other aux/iaas affect various aspects of plant growth and development, including lateral root formation, gravitropism, phototropism, pollination and adventitious formation  <cit> .

recently, many studies have revealed the involvement of aux/iaa proteins in the development of reproductive organs. in arabidopsis, the over-expression of iaa <dig> with a domain ii mutation damages cell elongation and cell division in inflorescences  <cit> . in maize, two aux/iaa proteins, bif <dig> and bif <dig>  control inflorescence architecture by regulating the expression of barren stalk <dig>  which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator necessary for axillary meristem formation, that shows a striking boundary expression pattern  <cit> . due to the minimal level of auxin signaling, the inflorescences of a dominant iaa <dig> mutant, axr <dig>  display negative phototropism, with a similar response curve to the positive phototropism of arabidopsis wild-type stems  <cit> . in tomato, sliaa <dig> is a negative auxin response regulator and its down-regulation triggers fruit set before pollination  <cit> . sl-iaa <dig>  another aux/iaa protein that is closely related to sliaa <dig> in terms of sequence homology, regulates fruit initiation and development in a distinct manner  <cit> .

as important components of the auxin signaling pathway, aux/iaa family proteins have been identified in many plant species. thus far,  <dig> aux/iaa family members in arabidopsis,  <dig> members in tomato ,  <dig> members in maize ,  <dig> members in medicago ,  <dig> members in cucumber , and  <dig> members in rice  have been identified . as a climacteric fruit, the market value of papaya is significantly limited by its short-term shelf life and rapid softening  <cit> . fruit ripening is associated with auxin signaling involved in the postharvest storage of fruits  <cit> . the elucidation of how aux/iaa-mediated auxin signaling function in postharvest decay is therefore of importance to both plant biologists and agronomists  <cit> . in the present work, we provide comprehensive information on the genomic structures, sequence homology levels and expression patterns of aux/iaa genes in papaya. our studies provide a new insight into the complexity of papaya aux/iaa expression during the fruit ripening process. the distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns of papaya aux/iaa  genes, and their differential responses to ripening-related hormones, provide clues for the functional characterizations of the auxin-responsive genes involved in fruit development and ripening.

protein structure, gene structure and phylogenetic relationship analysis of iaa family genes
the multiple sequence alignment results showed that four conserved domains  were contained in most cpiaa proteins. a classical lxlxlx motif was identified in domain i of most of the cpiaa proteins, except cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa31- <dig>  two nuclear localization signals , a bipartite nls and a simian virus 40-like nls, were found in most of the identified cpiaa proteins. the bipartite nls, containing two stretches of lysine/arginine residues, was found between domains i and ii, while the simian virus 40-like nls, consisting of several positively charged amino acid residues, was found in domain iv  <cit> . these putative nlss indicate that cpiaas are nuclear-located proteins . the distribution pattern of the exons and introns for each cpiaa gene was analyzed by a comparison of the full-length transcript sequences with the corresponding genomic dna sequences. the number of introns varied from one to four in the cpiaa family and is similar to the numbers found in other plant species  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> protein domain analysis of cpiaa family members. the alignment of papaya iaa proteins obtained with the clustalw program. the multiple alignment of the domains i–iv of the papaya iaa proteins are indicated by red lines. colored shading indicates identical and conserved amino acid residues. the lxlxlx motif is denoted by a thin yellow box. the two nlss are marked by black asterisks

expression of cpiaa and atiaa genes in response to auxin, aba, sa and ga treatments
auxin, aba, sa and ga are four major hormones involved in fruit development and ripening . the expression levels of cpiaa genes were tested in the c. papaya fruits by qrt-pcr under auxin, aba, sa and ga treatments. the expression levels of cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> were significantly up-regulated over five-fold under the auxin treatment, while cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> were significantly reduced by the auxin treatment . under the sa treatment, cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> were significantly induced, while cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> were significantly down-regulated . under the ga treatment, cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig>  were significantly induced and no cpiaa gene was significantly reduced . the expression levels of cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa15b were up-regulated under aba treatment .

the expression levels of atiaa genes response to various hormones was publicly available. furthermore, the expression of atiaa genes in response to auxin, sa, aba and ga were searched at ncbi in the dataset gse <dig>  interestingly, more than two auxres were contained in the promoter regions of atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig>  and the expression of atiaa <dig>  atiaa <dig> and atiaa <dig> were significantly up-regulated by auxin treatment. few gares were contained in the promoter regions of atiaa family gene, and the expression of most atiaa family genes showed no changes to ga treatment .

cpiaa gene expression patterns in different c. papaya tissues
there is a close relationship between biological functions and the organ-specific expression patterns of cpiaa genes. in this study, the spatio-specific expression of each member of the cpiaa family was assessed in various tissues, such as roots, flowers, shoots, leaves and fruits. the cpiaa gene transcript accumulations were detectable in four different organs. however, some cpiaa genes displayed a clear preferential expression in a specific organ, such as cpiaa <dig> showing the highest expression level in shoot, cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> in leaf, cpiaa <dig> in root, cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa15b in flower, and cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> in fruit . overall, the organ-preferential expression displayed by some cpiaa genes could be indicative of their involvement in specific c. papaya tissues and developmental processes.fig.  <dig> tissues-specific expression patterns of cpiaa genes. the expression patterns of the cpiaa genes in the five indicated organs were analyzed by absolute qrt-pcr. the data were analyzed by five independent replicates, and the standard deviations are shown with error bars




expression of cpiaa genes at different fruit developmental and ripening stages
several genetic studies have uncovered that fruit development and ripening is an auxin-related process  <cit> . firstly, we analyzed the expression levels of cpiaa genes during six different developmental stages. several cpiaa genes, including cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa15b, were induced during the developmental process and some cpiaa genes, including cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig>  were reduced . the six different developmental stages are shown in fig. 5b.fig.  <dig> heatmap of cpiaa gene expression during different fruit developmental stages. a changes in the expression levels during different fruit developmental stages, which are schematically depicted above the displayed qrt-pcr data, are relative to rna accumulation levels. levels of down-regulated expression  or up-regulated expression  are shown on a log <dig> scale from the highest to the lowest expression for each cpiaa gene. significant  differences are indicated by an asterisk. b different fruit developmental stages are shown as pictures




to elucidate the functions of the cpiaa genes during the fruit ripening period, their expression levels at six different postharvest stages were analyzed. the expression levels of most of the cpiaa genes were significantly changed during fruit ripening and softening. cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> expression levels significantly increased, while cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> expression levels significantly decreased. the expression of cpiaa <dig> peaked at stage  <dig>  and then declined slightly at stage  <dig>  the expression of cpiaa15b was induced significantly at stage  <dig>  and reached its peak at stage  <dig> .fig.  <dig> heatmap of cpiaa gene expression during different fruit ripening stages. a changes in the expression levels during different fruit ripening stages, which are schematically depicted above the displayed qrt-pcr data, are relative to rna accumulation levels. levels of down-regulated expression  or up-regulated expression  are shown on a log <dig> scale from the highest to the lowest expression for each cpiaa gene. significant  differences are indicated by an asterisk. b different fruit ripening stages are shown as pictures




expression of cpiaa genes under acc and 1-mcp treatments
ethylene is a major hormone that enhances fruit ripening. in our study, an ethylene precursor, acc, and an ethylene inhibitor, 1-mcp, were used to test how the expression of aux/iaa family genes was involved in fruit ripening  <cit> . the data showed that the expression of cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa15a, cpiaa15b, cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> was significantly induced by acc treatment; while the expression of cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> was significantly up-regulated by 1-mcp treatment. four genes, including cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig>  were significantly reduced under acc treatment; while two genes, cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig>  were significantly down-regulated under 1-mcp treatment .fig.  <dig> the expression patterns of cpiaa under acc and 1-mcp treatments. the expression levels of cpiaa genes in acc and 1-mcp treated seedlings were compared to a mock treatment as relative mrna levels. error bars represent standard deviations from five biological replicates. significant differences  between the control and hormone-treated samples are indicated by an asterisk




discussion
auxin is key signaling molecule for most growth and developmental processes in plants . aux/iaas repress the expression of down-stream genes by binding to arfs, which are also involved in auxin gene expression responses  <cit> . however, in papaya, there is little available information on iaa genes. the characterization and expression pattern analysis of cpiaa genes allowed us to uncover the mechanisms behind auxin involvement in fruit development and the ripening of papaya. in total,  <dig> iaa genes were identified in papaya, which was less than in model plants, such as arabidopsis  and rice   <cit> .

in plants, the expression levels of iaa family genes was regulated by different hormones  <cit> . our data showed that the transcript levels of many cpiaa genes were regulated by various hormone treatments . consistent with the changes in cpiaa expression, the promoter analysis revealed the presence of several well-identified hormone response elements in the promoter regions of the majority of cpiaa genes . this suggested that crosstalk among various hormones existed in papaya.

many atiaa and osiaa genes have been identified in previous reports  <cit> . comparative studies on phylogenetic relationships may provide useful information on the respective biological functions in papaya. floral initiation is a major step in the life cycle of plants. in arabidopsis, a gain-of-function mutation in iaa <dig> reduces the light-dependent gravitropism and phototropism of inflorescences, and confers late flowering under short-day light  <cit> . interestingly, cpiaa <dig>  a orthologous gene of atiaa <dig>  was most highly expressed in flowers , suggesting a putative role for cpiaa <dig> in the flowering process of papaya. atiaa <dig> is highly expressed in stamen filaments, and its gain-of-function mutant, msg <dig>  is defective in stamen filament development  <cit> . however, the expression of cpiaa <dig>  a orthologous gene of atiaa <dig>  is very weak in flowers . in addition, atiaa <dig> may be involved in both lateral and adventitious root formation  <cit> . the orthologous gene of atiaa <dig> in papaya, cpiaa <dig>  was preferentially expressed in roots, indicating its importance in papaya root development.

we also built a phylogenetic tree to show the relationships of iaa genes between papaya and rice . in rice, osiaa <dig> and osiaa <dig> both play essential roles in root system development  <cit> . based on the phylogenetic tree, the homologous gene of osiaa <dig> in papaya is cpiaa <dig> and the homologous gene of osiaa <dig> in papaya is cpiaa15b, suggesting that these two genes may play roles in papaya root development.

fruit development and ripening are complex developmental programs characterized by intense metabolic and textural changes  <cit> . previous studies have presumed a close relationship between auxin and fruit development and ripening in various plant species  <cit> . endogenous iaa plays roles in the flower and fruit development in papaya. however, how iaa genes function in the fruit development and ripening of papaya is largely unknown. in tomato, a model plant in fruit development studies, many iaa genes were identified as being involved in fruit development and ripening. for example, sliaa <dig> regulates quality parameters during tomato fruit development by interacting with several arf proteins  <cit> . the expression of cpiaa <dig>  a homologous gene of sliaa <dig> in papaya, was significantly reduced during the fruit developmental process, suggesting a putative function in papaya fruit development and ripening . sliaa <dig>  an aux/iaa family member in tomato, takes part in fruit development. sliaa <dig> showed constitutive expression in different organs and a rapid induction by auxin  <cit> . in our study, the expression of cpiaa <dig>  the papaya homolog of sliaa <dig>  was also detectable in all of the tested organs and was induced significantly by an auxin treatment . silencing sliaa <dig>  a gene closely related to sliaa <dig> in terms of sequence homology, causes a dramatic loss of fertility in tomato  <cit> . here, the homologous gene of sliaa <dig> has been identified in papaya . the expression of cpiaa <dig> was significantly increased during the fruit ripening process and reached its peak at stage  <dig> . our data indicated that cpiaa <dig>  cpiaa <dig> and cpiaa <dig> may be candidate genes for further studies on papaya fruit ripening. on the other hand, it has been widely known that ethylene plays an important role during the ripening process of climacteric fruit  <cit> . some studies showed that papaya displayed a dependence on ethylene, with an increase in production during its ripening process  <cit> . the significant changes in the expression of some cpiaa family genes under acc and 1-mcp treatments indicated a crosstalk between auxin and ethylene during the ripening process of papaya fruits.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, comprehensive information on the aux/iaa family in papaya, including gene structures, phylogenetic relationships and expression profiles, was provided. the involvement of cpiaa gene expression changes in fruit development and ripening gives us an opportunity to understand the roles of auxin signaling in the maturation of papaya reproductive organs.
