BACKGROUND
some organisms use a genetic mechanism to specify sex  <cit> . this often leads to degeneration of one homologue of the critical sex-determining chromosome. consequently, these species evolve a mechanism to survive the otherwise lethal consequences of monosomy for a large chromosome in one sex. in drosophila the primary mechanism of dosage compensation is male-specific hypertranscription of most genes along his single x chromosome to match the rna output from the two x chromosomes found in females  <cit> . this hypertranscription is mediated by acetylation of histone h <dig> at k <dig>  <cit>  throughout the entire body of transcribed genes hinting that the underlying mechanism may be an increase in the elongation rate of rna polymerase across x-linked genes  <cit> . the mechanism by which dosage compensation is limited to males is well understood  <cit> , but how x-linked genes are distinguished from autosomal genes is only beginning to come into focus  <cit> .

dosage compensation is carried out by a chromatin remodelling complex composed of large non-coding rox  rnas and at least five msl  proteins: msl <dig> , msl <dig> , msl <dig> , mof  and mle   <cit> . a chromatin remodelling complex consisting of msl <dig>  msl <dig>  msl <dig> and mof is also found in vertebrates  <cit> . so far no rna helicase or non-coding rna has been linked to the vertebrate msl complex. msl <dig> seems particularly important structurally because it contains docking sites for three of the other subunits. a predicted coiled coil near n-terminus binds msl <dig>  <cit> , and a domain near the c-terminus, containing a pehe motif, binds msl <dig> and mof  <cit> . the interactions between the c-terminal region of msl <dig> with msl <dig> and mof are the focus of this study. outside these motifs, most of the sequence is poorly conserved even within the genus drosophila. it is not clear how rox rnas interact with the protein subunits although non-sequence-specific rna interactions have been reported for mof, msl <dig> and mle  <cit> . the c-terminal region of msl <dig> is required for efficient rox rna incorporation into msl complexes, but it is not clear if this represents direct protein-rna contacts  <cit> . the msl complex is able to spread long distances in cis from sites of rox rna synthesis, and this has been taken as evidence that the msl protein subunits begin assembling onto nascent rox transcripts cotranscriptionally  <cit> .

the genes encoding the protein components of the complex were discovered because of their distinctive male-specific lethal loss of function phenotype. the two rox genes were found in screens for sex-specific transcripts and later found to act in dosage compensation  <cit> . several groups have studied the biochemical composition of the dosage compensation complex searching for additional components. these reports indicate that there are unlikely to be additional rox-like rna genes  <cit> , but several proteins copurify with the msl complex including components of the nuclear pore  <cit> . additionally, general chromatin remodelling proteins such as iswi, nurf <dig>  jil- <dig>  hp <dig>  and su3- <dig> display complex genetic interactions with the msl complex  <cit> . however, in each case it is unclear exactly how the different factors normally interact to produce the proper chromatin architecture along the male x.

if any component of the dosage compensation pathway performed additional functions, it may have been overlooked in screens for male-specific lethal mutants. enhancer-suppressor screens have been highly successful for identifying components of many pathways in flies and other model organisms, but the sex-specific lethality of dosage compensation is not easily incorporated into such a strategy. for instance, an inversion that places the normally euchromatic white locus next to centric heterochromatin results in mosaic white expression  in both sexes. many dozens of dominant modifier su mutants have been isolated that alter the eye colour of in wm <dig> flies. these turned out to encode key chromatin modifying enzymes. here we report a new genetic strategy that exploits epigenetic male-specific mosaic eye colour as a simple phenotypic readout for local msl activity amenable to modifier screens. we used unusual transgenic stocks in which a rox <dig> transgene had been inserted in random autosomal sites  <cit> . consistent with earlier findings, the autosomal rox <dig> transgenes could support dosage compensation of the x even if they were the only source of rox rna  <cit> . the surprising finding was that while most rox <dig> autosomal insertions expressed the adjacent miniwhite marker normally to give solid pigmented eye colour in both males and females, roughly 10% to 15% of the random insertions displayed mosaic patches of eye pigment only in males. many lines show further pairing-dependent silencing of miniwhite where homozygous males have less pigmentation than hemizygotes. these unusual stocks had the transgene integrated in a wide variety of sites, and the females in these stocks had either pale eye colour or completely white eyes indicating that the miniwhite reporter was epigenetically silenced. the miniwhite marker could be activated in females that were supplied with a complete set of dosage compensation components showing that eye colour was a marker for msl complex activity  <cit> . in these stocks, the rox <dig> gene nucleated ectopic dosage compensation at the transgene, opening the surrounding chromatin and permitting miniwhite expression in patches in the male eye. when these rox <dig> transgenes that have mosaic eye pigmentation were crossed into males deleted for the endogenous rox <dig> and rox <dig> genes, msl complex spread >  <dig> mbp from the autosomal sites of rox <dig> transcription in essentially all cells in larval salivary glands. this was accompanied by a change to solid red eye colour only in males  <cit> . this shows that subtle changes in the local distribution or activity of the msl complex can be easily detected by alterations in the epigenetic male mosaic eye pattern long before they affect male viability.

we exploited these unusual transgenics stocks to carry out a dominant modifier screen searching for mutations that alter msl complex activity enough to detect a change in male eye colour. in this strategy, all flies retain one wild-type allele of the candidate modifier gene, so that if the gene of interest performs essential functions besides dosage compensation, viable animals are still recovered. it is possible to search for mutants that either epigenetically changed from mosaic to solid red  or nearly solid white . here, we report the results of the former screen. of the  <dig> mutations isolated,  <dig> mapped to known components of the dosage compensation complex demonstrating the specificity of the screen design. we focused our analysis on the new mutations in msl <dig> because they likely alter complex assembly and spreading by disrupting the interface that binds msl <dig> and mof, two other well characterised subunits of the dosage compensation complex. the new msl <dig> alleles display a complex pattern of gain of function and loss of function when subjected to a battery of assays.

RESULTS
a genetic screen for dominant modifiers of dosage compensation
we carried out a dominant f <dig> enhancer screen  on a gmrox <dig> transgene that carries a wild-type genomic melanogaster rox <dig> gene on a  <dig>  kb ecori fragment adjacent to the miniwhite eye pigmentation marker  <cit>  inserted in a yoyo element at 75c in the euchromatic region of the third chromosome. this transgene is subject to further pairing-dependent silencing in males . initially we found that reducing the dose of the known msl proteins by half in males heterozygous for msl <dig>  msl <dig>  msl <dig> and mle had no consistent effect on the mosaic eye pattern of males carrying one copy of gmrox1-75c . however, removing the endogenous rox <dig> and rox <dig> genes resulted in sons with solid red eyes and extensive cis spreading of the msl complex from the transgene, presumably because, in the absence of endogenous rox expression, more msl subunits are available to associate with the rox <dig> transcripts made at the transgene .

we screened approximately  <dig> ethyl methane sulfonate -treated sons for mutations that increased the fraction of red eye tissue and established  <dig> second chromosome mutant stocks that transmitted the modifier mutation through the germline . while the modifiers enhanced miniwhite expression in males indicating that the msl complex is more active immediately around the rox <dig> transgene, they were unable to stimulate miniwhite expression in females . the modifiers also overcame the pairing-dependent repression so the change in eye phenotype was more dramatic when the gmrox1-75c transgene was homozygous. mapping and complementation analysis indicated that three mutations are unusual alleles of msl <dig>  and one maps to mle, two critical components of the dosage compensation complex.

the enhanced pigmentation we observe with the modifier mutations cannot be due to msl <dig> haploinsufficiency, but rather the modifiers must make proteins with altered activities. this was shown by testing the l <dig> deletion  <cit>  in msl1l60/+; gmrox1-75c/gmrox1-75c males and observing no effect on the eye pigmentation pattern . we recovered essentially equal numbers of msl1mod/+ sons compared to either msl1mod/+ sisters or +/+ brothers arguing against an antimorphic mechanism . surprisingly, after extraneous secondary mutations were removed by recombination, some homozygous modifier males were recovered which also showed solid red eyes . the solid red eye phenotype of modifier males argues that mutants have an increased probability of modifying the local chromatin around the rox <dig> insertion. by contrast, the male specific lethality observed in modifier/df animals demonstrates that the modifiers have reduced ability to dosage compensate the x.

to exclude the possibility that these mutants affected general silencing, we tested their effects on the well characterised position effect variegation  mutation in  wm <dig>  which displays mosaic pigmentation in both sexes. while su2- <dig> made the eyes solid red in both sexes as expected  <cit> , our new modifier mutations had no effect . furthermore, in mosaic lines where gmrox <dig> transgene is inserted at the telomere of chromosome 2r  or at the 5' end of the defective proventriculus  gene , each of the three modifier msl <dig> mutations increased red pigmentation in male eyes  but the females remained pure white. these results show that the effect of the modifiers is completely male specific and largely independent of chromatin context. this indicates that they act on some aspect of the dosage compensation pathway rather than the surrounding repressive chromatin. this is consistent with the finding that most mosaic gmrox <dig> insertions respond weakly or not at all to suppressor of variegation mutations or dose of the heterochromatic y chromosome  <cit> . in the specific case of the gmrox <dig> insertion at 75c used for our screen, mutations in su2- <dig>  su3- <dig>  and su <dig> each failed to make the eyes red .

the modifier msl <dig> mutations map to the conserved pehe domain
sequencing showed that the three modifier msl <dig> mutations fell in the most conserved pehe domain that binds msl <dig> and mof . two alleles, p864l and s943f, are missense mutations that changed amino acid residues conserved within the genus drosophila. the third allele, f979z, is an 11-bp deletion replacing the last  <dig> amino acids of msl <dig> with  <dig> amino acid residues from another reading frame. these residues are near the previously defined mof and msl <dig> binding sites . we tested whether simply disrupting the pehe domain would cause the dominant eye pigmentation effect on mosaic gmrox <dig> transgenes. in previously unpublished screens for msl <dig> mutations, alleles mapping near the c-terminus were recovered that behaved as nulls in male viability assays. the msl1afg allele changes two nearby codons,  <dig> and  <dig>  from afg, a triplet conserved from flies to mammals, to eff . the second pre-existing allele, k1009x, generates a stop codon soon after the pehe domain truncating the last  <dig> residues. neither the afg nor k1009x mutations behaved as modifiers, although afg had a variable weak effect . thus, the gain of function phenotype seen with p864l, s943f, and f979z cannot simply be due to disruption of the critical pehe domain or loss of the fly-specific cter domain, but instead must alter the activity in some distinctive way. the phenotype and sequences of modifiers suggests that they produce stable msl <dig> proteins. western blot analysis showed this was the case . mutant msl <dig> can be detected in all samples although k1009x and afg accumulate to only low levels.

complementation between msl <dig> alleles
li and coworkers  <cit>  have presented evidence that msl <dig> forms homodimers through a sequence at the extreme n-terminus of the protein. the dominant behaviour of the new modifier mutations might be explained if modifier msl <dig> subunits dimerised in vivo with wild-type polypeptides made from the other allele. we crossed the three modifier alleles to each other, afg, k1009x, and the msl1l <dig> deletion in all possible combinations . the two missense modifiers are male lethal over a deletion, but produced adult males when homozygous. thus, these are the first hypomorphic alleles of msl <dig> reported, and demonstrate how exquisitely sensitive flies are to the level of msl <dig> activity. changing the mslmod dose by only twofold causes an approximately 100-fold change in male viability normalised to sisters of the same genotype . all classes of surviving adult males had solid red eye colour  except rare mod/df escapers that had pale mosaic eyes . in addition to strong dose sensitivity, we observed interallelic rescue that is difficult to attribute solely to protein levels. for instance, heterozygous s943f/afg male viability was higher than either homozygote  despite the fact that the afg protein accumulates to low levels . we can exclude any viability effects caused by secondary mutations along the ems-treated chromosome, because we measure male viability relative to their homozygous sisters who share any background mutations. even though some heteroallelic combinations, such as s943f/p864l, produced males in nearly medelian ratios, they had shorter lifespans compared to all other siblings .

both k1009x and afg were scored as nulls when initially isolated, but their ability to complement p864l and s943f modifier alleles demonstrates that they retain a subset of functions. in contrast, the p864l and s943f proteins only supported about 7% viability in combination with frameshift modifier, f979z. this protein is the same length as k1009x but has lost the last few amino acid residues of the pehe motif followed by scrambled sequence, whereas k1009x carries a wild-type pehe domain . we attribute the greater ability to complement to the presence of a complete pehe domain in k1009x. these examples of interallelic complementation are most easily accommodated in a model where msl <dig> forms dimers within the msl complex  <cit> . we saw no complementation between f979z and k1009x, both of which lack the cter sequence immediately following pehe .

localisation of modifier msl <dig> proteins on polytene chromosomes
the pattern of complementation suggested that some mutations might have defects in different functional domains in the protein. to test this idea we first examined whether the mutant msl <dig> proteins retained any ability to bind the male x chromosome in the absence of wild-type msl <dig>  the f979z frameshift protein bound the x at only about 30- <dig> bands . both p864l/df and s943f/df males showed strong painting of the male x despite the fact that these males die before adulthood . the non-modifier afg and k1009x proteins bound the x very weakly at only approximately 10- <dig> bands , which could be partially attributed to the lower stability of these proteins .

we next measured the ability of the mutant msl <dig> proteins to recruit the other components of the complex. we found that the msl <dig> banding pattern closely resembled the msl <dig> pattern in all mutants . both p864l and s943f showed reductions in msl <dig> and mof staining to differing degrees, as might be expected if the amino acid substitutions altered the docking sites for these two subunits . f979z recruited mof to the few bands on the x, but no msl <dig> was detectable . the afg protein weakly recruited mof, but msl <dig> was undetectable even in grossly overexposed photographs . we also measured rox <dig> rna levels in these flies. northern blots showed that the f979z, k1009x and afg mutants that fail to recruit msl <dig> also had no rox <dig> rna. by contrast the two missense alleles that painted the x in a nearly normal pattern and could recruit some msl <dig> accumulated high levels of rox <dig> .

subunit interactions
polytene chromosome analysis only detects subunit interactions within complexes that were successfully recruited to the x, but any soluble msl proteins are lost. we used coimmunoprecipitation experiments to test the ability of mutant msl <dig> proteins to bind mof and msl <dig> regardless of whether they also bound the x. flag-tagged msl <dig> fragments encompassing residues 751- <dig>  were coexpressed in s <dig> cells with either full length msl <dig> or full length mof each tagged with haemagglutinin  . all five msl <dig> mutant proteins readily interacted with both msl <dig> and mof, although the missense mutants s943f and p864l were slightly stronger and afg showed somewhat reduced binding to msl <dig>  the ability of most msl <dig> mutants to bind both msl <dig> and mof was unexpected given the results with polytene chromosomes. in particular, the two c-terminal truncations, k1009x and f979z, each bound mof weakly and msl <dig> not at all on the polytene chromosomes , but precipitated msl <dig> and mof efficiently from s <dig> cells . this indicates that the pehe domain is sufficient for msl <dig> interaction in solution, but that the cter domain is essential to stably tether msl <dig> to the x chromosome. previous work reported that the cter rather than the pehe domain was sufficient for strong msl1-msl <dig> binding . we agree that critical msl1-msl <dig> interactions map to the cter, but consider the newly observed pehe-msl <dig> interactions to be authentic for three reasons. first, they were obtained after  <dig> m nacl washes. second, an unrelated flag-tagged protein  lane 2) was unable to precipitate either mof or msl <dig>  finally, we assayed a truncation encompassing msl <dig> residues 766- <dig>  l940x, equivalent to fragment f assayed by morales et al.  <cit> . l940x precipitated mof but not msl <dig> as described earlier  demonstrating that our assay conditions are comparable to those used by others. these observations argue against non-physiological binding between msl <dig> and k1009x or f979z due to over expression in cell culture, and instead, suggest that msl <dig> binds msl <dig> by two distinct domains .

msl <dig> mutants abolish msl complex cis spreading
when msl complex contains rna derived from an autosomal rox <dig> transgene, it can either diffuse to the x in trans, or spread in cis around the transgene. this choice is strongly affected by the amount of msl subunits available for assembly, the rate of rox <dig> transcription, and the presence of any other source of competing rox transcripts  <cit> . we tested whether the red eye phenotype seen in our msl <dig> modifier mutants was due to enhanced cis spreading from rox <dig> transgenes, as observed in rox <dig> rox <dig> mutants . no local autosomal msl spreading was seen in rox1- rox2+/y; f979z/+ males regardless whether the gmrox1-75c transgene was hemizygous or homozygous . only a single msl <dig> band at the 75c insertion site was detectable, and this is due to binding to a well characterised internal enhancer element  <cit> . the other two modifier alleles did not support widespread spreading either . this shows that the red eye colour phenotype of modifier msl <dig> mutants is not the result of enhanced long distance msl spreading around the gmrox <dig> transgene.

we next examined the msl complex distribution in males whose only source of rox rna was the gmrox1-75c transgene. while robust autosomal msl spreading  consistently occurred around the gmrox1-75c transgene in nearly all nuclei of msl1+ homozygotes , spreading was abolished in males heterozygous for any of the five msl <dig> mutations or deletion . not only do the modifiers not enhance local spreading, instead they totally block spreading even under conditions where it is normally favoured. we went on to test whether mutations in any msl subunit would likewise dominantly abolish local spreading. we found that msl21/+, mle1/+ and mlei926z/+ heterozygous males continued to support massive cis spreading from gmrox1-75c . this indicates that cis spreading is particularly dependent upon msl <dig> 

modifier msl <dig> proteins support dosage compensation using autosomal rox <dig> rna
finding that msl <dig> mutations abolished cis spreading of mature msl complexes around autosomal rox <dig> transgenes despite the presence of wild-type msl <dig> subunits, we asked if these same flies had impaired ability to dosage compensate the x chromosome in trans. we measured the ability of the different msl <dig> mutants to support dosage compensation when the only source of rox rna was the autosomal transgene. males that lack the endogenous rox <dig> and rox <dig> genes die, but can be partially rescued by an autosomal gmrox <dig> transgenes  <cit> . northern blots showed that rox <dig> rna levels produced by gmrox1-75c are comparable to wild-type levels . we found that an autosomal gmrox <dig> transgene could not restore male viability if the amount of msl <dig> was reduced by half in msl1l60/+ hemizygous males . this assay clearly divided the msl <dig> point mutants into distinct classes. the three modifier alleles that enhance eye pigmentation in gmrox1-75c mosaic males restored male viability when heterozygous with one copy of msl1+ . the afg and k1009x non-modifier alleles behaved more like simple loss of function l <dig> deletion in this assay. the ability of the modifier alleles to restore dosage compensation to the x nearly as well as wild-type msl <dig> demonstrates that such complexes have essentially normal chromatin remodelling activity, despite having dramatically impaired ability to spread locally.

the viability of rox <dig> rox2/y; msl1/+; /+ males was measured when the only source of rox rna was the autosomal transgene. in each case the progeny were from rox <dig> rox <dig> mothers mated to rox+/y; msl1/cyo; / fathers. the cyo progeny were discarded and the fraction of msl1/+ sons and daughters was compared. the first column indicates which msl <dig> allele was used. the middle column shows the percentage male viability compared to their sisters, and the right column gives the number of msl1/+ females recovered in each cross.

modifier mutation in the mle rna helicase
the weakest modifier recovered in our screen was a late frameshift mutation in the mle rna helicase subunit of the msl complex . as was the case with msl <dig>  null mutations in mle do not act as modifiers . the mlei926z allele displays a male-specific lethal phenotype when homozygous or in combination with null alleles of mle. this mutation does not affect long distance msl spreading from sites of rox <dig> transcription . because the mutant protein retains the two n-terminal double stranded rna binding motifs and helicase region, we asked if the recessive male lethality might be due to loss of the distinct glycine-aromatic heptad repeats at the c-terminus of mle, postulated to bind rna  <cit> . we constructed an mle transgene lacking the repeats  but found that it supported male viability , but the rescued males were sterile. this shows that the heptad repeat is needed for its germline function, but not for dosage compensation. thus, male lethality displayed by the modifier allele is most likely due to the loss of some element required for dosage compensation located between codons  <dig> and  <dig> .

discussion
genetic screens assaying for male-specific lethality identified the known components of the dosage compensation complex, and yet the precise mechanism by which the msl complex acts upon rna polymerase is not understood. we developed a new approach to search for factors that are needed for either the activity or targeting of the msl complex using a simple eye pigmentation assay. this dominant screen has the potential to recover genes that would have been overlooked previously because they perform additional essential functions in females. in fact, two of the new mutants are recessive lethal to females as well as males. based on the following criteria we consider the mutants isolated by this strategy relevant to the process of dosage compensation.  all modifiers alter eye pigmentation exclusively in males.  the modifiers have no effect on general position effect variegation.  the modifiers act on rox <dig> transgene inserted in diverse repressive environments indicating that they act on rox <dig> rather than relieving flanking repressive chromatin.  of the  <dig> mutants recovered,  <dig> mapped to genes encoding known components of msl dosage compensation complex. here we focused on the unusual characteristics of the new msl <dig> mutations because their eye colour phenotype indicates increased dosage compensation, yet in most assays they behave as loss of function.

a chromatin-remodelling machine similar to the msl complex can be found in most animals where it probably acetylates histone h <dig> at many genes in both sexes. within the genus drosophila this complex has been recruited to x-linked genes in males to carry out dosage compensation. this specialisation almost certainly required changes in one or more of the msl subunits allowing them to interact with rox rnas and bind only the male x. the most conserved region of msl <dig> proteins from insects to vertebrates is termed the pehe motif  <cit> . the pehe domain was known to bind the mof histone acetyltransferase  <cit> . a short interval in the middle of the pehe, which we term the core , is strongly conserved among most insects and vertebrates, but is significantly different in drosophila. immediately upstream of the pehe domain is a highly acidic region and downstream is a second strongly conserved block, cter, found only within the genus drosophila . the acidic motif, core, and cter drosophila-specific domains are candidate adaptations needed for msl complex to carry out the new role of dosage compensation. our mutational analysis highlights the roles of pehe and cter.

the three modifier mutations recovered in msl <dig> cluster around the pehe domain. the two missense mutants display an unusual constellation of phenotypes. when heterozygous with a wild-type allele, the males are fully viable showing that the x is compensated, but more importantly, the eye colour shifts from mosaic to solid red. this shows that msl complexes containing the mutant protein are more effective at modifying chromatin immediately around sites of rox <dig> transcription so that the adjacent miniwhite marker has a high probability of being epigenetically activated. the same mutations are male specific lethal over a deletion indicating loss of function. while these proteins paint the x in a nearly normal pattern, they can only partially recruit mof and msl <dig> to the x. msl complexes lacking msl <dig> are restricted to approximately  <dig> high affinity sites along the x  <cit> , so finding a high density of msl <dig> bands in the modifiers suggests that msl <dig> likely associates transiently with mutant msl <dig> at all sites in vivo even if it is difficult to capture with our fixation conditions. this is in agreement with our finding that the modifier msl <dig> mutants bind msl <dig> efficiently in precipitation assays .

the cter domain  is strongly conserved within the genus but shows no resemblance to the c-terminus in mosquitoes or other insects . this domain is essential for dosage compensation in vivo as shown by the male-specific lethal phenotype of the late nonsense mutant k1009x. the initial mapping of msl1-msl <dig> interactions to the cter domain  <cit>  was surprising because this domain is not conserved outside drosophila, and yet msl <dig> binds msl <dig> even in vertebrates. here we resolve this issue by showing that the conserved pehe domain carries a second msl <dig> binding region. while our observations that k1009x and f979z fail to recruit msl <dig> to polytene chromosomes is fully in agreement with earlier work, we were initially surprised to find both truncations robustly precipitated msl <dig> in coimmunoprecipitation experiments in cell culture. the ability of k1009x and f979z to bind msl <dig> maps to the second half of the pehe domain . this is consistent with the observation that mutations in the highly conserved afg residues within the pehe domain abolish msl <dig> binding in vivo despite the presence of the cter domain. this argues that the pehe domain makes critical contacts with both msl <dig> and mof that are likely to be evolutionarily ancient because only the pehe domain is conserved through vertebrates. the new mosaic eye assay used in this screen apparently selected for mutants that subtly altered subunit interactions without completely abolishing them. we propose that the cter motif exclusive to drosophila provides additional contacts necessary for the recently acquired function of dosage compensation. we note that removing this c-terminal domain results in loss of rox <dig> rna  as expected if this motif plays some new role in aiding msl <dig> target the x in conjunction with rox rnas.

we propose that the pehe and cter domains have distinct functions based on the observation that the missense modifier mutants restore partial male viability to k1009x and afg mutants, but not to an msl <dig> deletion. if each mutant affected distinct functions within msl <dig>  then males making mixed msl complexes might partially restore function. however, the f979z modifier only weakly complements p864l and s943f. although both f979z and k1009x delete the cter domain, f979z also deletes the last few conserved residues of the pehe domain explaining the reduced ability to complement. this would also explain why f979z fails to complement afg. these complex complementation patterns are most easily explained if msl <dig> dimerises within msl complexes  <cit> .

prior to this study, the only factor affecting the mosaic miniwhite expression linked to rox <dig> transgenes was removing the endogenous rox <dig> and rox <dig> genes . this also results in massive local spreading of the msl complex around the rox transgene. we were therefore surprised to find that while the dominant msl <dig> modifiers have the same affect on the mosaic eye pattern as rox deletions, the modifiers abolished cis spreading rather than enhancing it. massive local spreading appears to be coupled to cotranscriptional assembly of msl subunits onto nascent rox transcripts  <cit> . under conditions where assembly is completed by the time the 3' end of rox <dig> rna is released from polymerase, local spreading is favoured. when partially completed rox transcripts are released before assembly is completed, the inactive complex diffuses away from the site of rox synthesis preventing local spreading. the msl <dig> mutants characterised here block local spreading in a dominant fashion even when wild-type subunits are available. we propose this is a direct reflection of how the mutant msl <dig> subunits affect the assembly process.

flies are exquisitely sensitive to the dose of msl <dig>  when msl <dig> is ectopically expressed in females, only about 15% of the animals reach adulthood and are sterile. simply reducing msl <dig> by half completely relieves this toxicity  <cit> . however, overexpressing msl <dig> in the presence of ectopic msl <dig> kills 100% of females  <cit> . in the present study we found that the viability of males carrying modifier mutations p864l or s943f changes drastically over only a twofold change in protein levels. we also found that reducing the msl <dig> dose by half in msl1l60/+ males is sufficient to block distant cis spreading of the msl complex. this suggests that the availability of msl <dig> subunits is the most limiting factor controlling assembly onto rox rnas. although msl1-msl <dig> heterodimers are thought to form the core of the dosage compensation complex, we propose msl <dig> has a stronger effect on assembly kinetics because it alone recruits msl <dig> and mof to the complex. the modifier alleles isolated here reinforce this model. in this case they act not by altering the abundance of msl <dig>  but rather act at the msl1:mof and msl1:msl <dig> interfaces. the two missense msl <dig> modifier proteins are produced in amounts comparable to wild type , stabilise rox <dig> rna , are incorporated into msl complexes and paint the x in a nearly normal pattern . their capacity to block mixed complexes containing wild-type msl <dig> from spreading is more likely due to problems coupling msl assembly with 3' processing and release of rox <dig> transcripts. the red eye phenotype indicates that complexes tend to accumulate immediately around the site of rox <dig> transcription, activating miniwhite. the role of msl <dig> in spreading may be its ability to recognise actively transcribed genes by their histone h3k36me <dig> mark  <cit> . this might explain why alterations around the pehe domain that affect whether or how msl <dig> is presented to chromatin would inhibit extensive cis spreading.

we also isolated a single modifier allele in mle that is a late frame shift that retains the two dsrna binding motifs and the large helicase domain. as in the case of the msl <dig> modifier alleles, the mle modifier displays recessive male lethality in addition to the dominant effect on mosaic eye colour. we showed that the male lethality cannot be attributed to the aromatic repeat sequence at the c-terminus, but rather must be located more upstream in a poorly characterised region of the protein. the biochemical role of mle in dosage compensation is not known, but it is tempting to speculate that it acts on rox rnas, either during assembly of the msl complex, or to catalyse conformational changes in the complex either during cycles of histone modification, or movement along the chromosome.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a new genetic strategy to identify components of the dosage compensation pathway in drosophila using a simple dominant eye colour phenotype. this yielded new mutation of msl <dig> and mle with novel phenotypes never observed in previously isolated alleles, which are likely due to disruption in specific subunit contacts that alter complex assembly. we also recovered mutations in new genes not previously linked to dosage compensation that have additional functions in females.
