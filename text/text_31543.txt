BACKGROUND
 clusters may be the most ancient and versatile inorganic cofactors in biological systems. they can be found in all living organisms, participating in electron transfer, catalysis and regulatory processes. besides,  clusters are involved in sensing environmental stimuli and regulation of protein expression  <cit> . in plants, the biogenesis of fe-s proteins is compartmentalized and mostly adapted to the requirements of the green tissue, which carries out both photosynthesis and respiration, processes that require significant amounts of fe-s proteins. mitochondria and plastid have their own machineries for  cluster assembly, which differ in biochemical and genetic properties. among the fe-s proteins known in plant mitochondria are complexes i, ii and iii of the respiratory chain and aconitase of the citric acid cycle, and in plastids are cytochrome b6f complex, photosystem i and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase  <cit> .

three different systems for  clusters biosynthesis have been identified in bacteria, all of them share cysteine desulfurases and  cluster scaffold proteins. those systems are referred to as nif , isc  and suf   <cit> . there are several mitochondrial proteins homologous to the bacterial isc system, including a group i nifs-like proteins, supporting the evolutionary relationship between Î± proteobacteria and mitochondria  <cit> . in yeast, it has been shown that mitochondria are the primary site of  cluster formation; however, these organelles not only produce their own fe-s proteins, but are also required for the maturation of cytosolic fe-s proteins  <cit> . in the chloroplast, five different  cluster types are found in various proteins, and this organelle possesses its own machinery for  biosynthesis which is most similar to those found in cyanobacteria containing the suf system and the cysteine desulfurase which is similar to the bacterial sufs, a group ii nifs-like protein  <cit> .

cysteine desulfurase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate -dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of l-cysteine to l-alanine and sulfane sulfur. this occurs through the formation of a protein-bound cysteine persulfide intermediate on a conserved cysteine residue  <cit> . considering that sulfide and free iron are toxic to the cell, intracellular concentrations are thought to be extremely low. besides being involved in sulfur mobilization, cysteine desulfurase is proposed to be involved in cellular iron homeostasis  <cit> . isd <dig> is an essential mitochondria matrix protein, a component of the isc-assembly machinery, and is conserved in eukaryotes, but not found in prokaryotes. this protein forms a stable complex with nfs <dig>  increases nfs <dig> activity, and is essential for the enzymatic activity of several fe-s proteins  <cit> . sulfur-containing defense compounds  are involved in stress response and their synthesis involve several genes for sulfur assimilation  <cit> .

it is hypothesized that soybean  has gone through at least two polyploidy and diploidization events, being considered a paleopolyploid  <cit> , still presenting many gene duplications  <cit> . various stresses can adversely affect plant growth and crop production, such as low temperature which modifies membrane lipid composition, thus affecting mitochondria respiratory function  <cit>  and presumably photosynthesis. expression of various plant genes is regulated by abiotic environmental stresses such as cold. many cis-acting elements involved in stress response and stress-inducible genes contain cis-acting elements in their promoter regions have been described.

here, we identified the soybean cysteine desulfurase genes by sequence comparison. furthermore, we investigate the responsiveness of these genes under biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as transcript distribution in different tissues. association between the high transcript level of mitochondrial genes, nfs <dig> and isd <dig>  and an increased expression of two cytosolic fe-s proteins is showing here. our data also demonstrate the relationship between the presence of specific cis-elements and regulation of transcript levels under various conditions.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
comparative protein analyses showed that there are four cysteine desulfurase genes in g. max, corresponding to loci glyma01g <dig>  glyma09g <dig>  glyma11g <dig> and glyma15g <dig>  these proteins can be classified into two groups: the first group is composed of iscs-like proteins, mitochondrial cysteine desulfurases, which are encoded by the genes located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> ; the second group encompasses sufs-like proteins, plastid cysteine desulfurases, which are encoded by genes located on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> . soybean nfs <dig> genes share 94% nucleic acid similarity and 98% protein identity, while nfs <dig> genes share 96% nucleic acid similarity and 97% protein identity. when compared to arabidopsis thaliana sequences, nfs <dig> proteins have 76% protein identity, whereas nfs <dig> have 77%. pfam analysis demonstrated that all genes encode for an aminotransferase class-v motif and alignment analysis showed the location of a cysteine in the active site and a histidine and alanine in the cofactor binding site . to find isd <dig> genes, we used sequences from saccharomyces cerevisiae and a. thaliana as queries against the glyma <dig> genome. we found two loci that encode isd <dig> orthologs, glyma08g <dig> and glyma18g <dig>  showing 87% protein identity . soybean genes that encode nfs <dig>  nfs <dig> and isd <dig> appear at least twice on different chromosomes due to duplication events  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
comparative amino acid analysis of iscs-like and sufs-like proteins of different plants and bacterial species showed that conserved regions varied from  <dig> to 98% and from  <dig> to 97% identity, respectively. a phylogenetic analysis of a wide range of organisms has shown that cysteine desulfurases form three independent clusters . one clade was composed by all sequences from the isc system, and divided into monocots, dicots and bacteria, forming three subclades. the second cluster contained bacterial and algae sequences of cysteine desulfurases from the nif system. the third clade was composed of proteins from the suf system, and subdivided into three clades, showing the same branching as the isc system. some bacterial and all mitochondria located proteins clustered together; some bacterial, cyanobacterial and all plastid located proteins were also found in one cluster. this is in agreement with the endosymbiotic theory, which establishes a relationship between the endosymbiotic host and the bacterial ancestors  <cit> .

transcript analysis of cysteine desulfurases and isd <dig> genes in soybean
considering that fe-s proteins are involved in environmental or cellular sensing  <cit> , quantitative rt-pcr was performed in order to investigate transcript levels of cysteine desulfurases and isd <dig> in soybean. we designed gene-specific primers for nfs1_chr <dig>  nfs1-_chr <dig>  nfs2_chr <dig> and nfs2_chr <dig> and analyzed the expression pattern of leaves and roots from non-treated plants and plants treated with salicylic acid  and cold incubation. further, to study whether isd <dig> transcript levels are co-regulated with the nfs <dig> expression pattern, we performed a quantitative rt-pcr with non-treated and cold-treated plants. for all studied genes the transcript levels were normalized to the transcript levels of f-box and metalloprotease  <cit> .

in order to determine whether duplicated genes have differential expression profiles, we analyzed mrna accumulation in control plants. these analyses showed that each cysteine desulfurase gene is individually expressed indicating a differential response to environmental stimuli. as the duplicated genes share a high degree amino acid identity, we summed expression levels from both copies to compare total nfs <dig> and nfs <dig> mrna accumulation. while nfs1_chr <dig> is predominantly expressed in roots, we found higher nfs1_chr <dig> transcript levels in leaves. in sum, a higher level is found in roots . nfs2_chr <dig> shows a higher expression in both organs as compared to nfs2_chr <dig>  nfs2_chr <dig> transcripts mostly accumulate in roots and those of nfs2_chr <dig> in leaves . in both organs, isd11_chr <dig> shows a higher expression level than isd11_chr <dig>  taken together, a higher level was found in roots . as shown in genevestigator database, nfs <dig> is highly expressed in roots than in leaves in arabidopsis thaliana, while nfs <dig> is predominantly expressed in leaves  <cit> .

it appeared that cold-treated plants exhibited a differential response depending on the gene and tissue. in roots, nfs1_chr <dig> showed a higher expression than nfs1_chr <dig> during the whole treatment. while nfs1_chr <dig> transcript level decreased upon cold treatment, those of nfs1_chr <dig> increased . sum analysis showed that total nfs <dig> mrna in roots did not respond to cold treatment . in leaves, nfs1_chr <dig> was higher expressed than nfs1_chr <dig> during the whole treatment. nfs1_chr <dig> transcript level oscillated, and nfs1_chr <dig> increased its expression during cold treatment . total nfs <dig> mrna increased in leaves after cold incubation . these results corroborate with a. thaliana database, where leaves improve expression during cold treatment, while roots do not change  <cit> . cold-treatment induced a decrease in both nfs2_chr <dig> and nfs2_chr <dig> transcript levels in roots reaching a comparable expression level at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h  . in leaves, nfs2_chr <dig> showed a higher expression level than nfs2_chr <dig> during the whole treatment. while nfs2_chr <dig> transcript levels decreased, nfs2_chr <dig> increased at  <dig> h . sum analysis showed that cold-treatment induced a decrease in nfs <dig> genes transcript levels . in roots, isd11_chr <dig> was higher expressed than isd11_chr <dig> during the whole treatment. while isd11_chr <dig> transcript levels increased were cold induced, isd11_chr <dig> did not show changes in expression . sum analysis revealed that total isd <dig> mrna initially decreased and then reached the former level in roots upon cold treatment . in leaves, isd11_chr <dig> showed a higher expression than isd11_chr <dig> during whole treatment, but both genes were upregulated upon cold treatment .

when treated with  <dig> mm sa, the response of cysteine desulfurase expression varies depending on tissue and gene. in roots, both nfs <dig> genes were upregulated upon sa incubation. thus, sum analysis showed that nfs <dig> mrna level after sa treatment was significantly higher than before . in leaves, nfs1_chr <dig> decreased expression, while nfs1_chr <dig> did not show any changes. total nfs <dig> mrna level decreased due to sa treatment . when a. thaliana were treated with  <dig> mm sa during  <dig> hours, nfs <dig> expression was induced  <cit> . nfs <dig> transcript levels did not change in roots . in leaves, nfs2_chr <dig> showed a significant decrease in expression, while nfs2_chr <dig> did not change. sum analysis, for leaf, did not show any changes in expression .

cis-elements search in promoter regions
to identify putative cis-elements present in the nfs <dig> and nfs <dig> promoters, we inspected the sequences  <dig>  bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of all genes using the plant cis-acting regulatory elements  database  <cit> . the analysis identified a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hits for potential cis-elements putative transcription factor binding sites in nfs1_chr <dig>  nfs1_chr <dig>  nfs2_chr <dig> and nfs2_chr <dig>  respectively. while some of the predicted cis-elements were present multiple times in the promoters, others occurred only once. all putative transcription factor binding sites with known function are shown in table  <dig>  comparative analysis among cysteine desulfurase promoter regions showed sequence similarity between  <dig> and 66%, and that the amount of shared cis-elements varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . comparing duplicated genes, they have a high promoter region similarity, and nfs <dig> and isd <dig> promoters diverged less than those of nfs <dig> genes . the relationship between some motifs and our quantitative rt-pcr results are shown in table  <dig>

coincidence of increased nfs1/isd <dig> transcript levels and activities of cytosolic fe-s enzymes
aldehyde oxidase  catalyzes the conversion of an aldehyde to an acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen and water and xanthine dehydrogenase  catalyzes the hydrogenation of xanthine to urate. both enzymes require fad, molybdenum and two  clusters as cofactors. therefore, ao and xdh activities are directly dependent on the mitochondrial  cluster assembly machinery. hence, we analyzed the activity of ao and xdh using an in-gel activity assay  <cit> . in comparison to unstressed leaves, xdh activities were clearly enhanced upon cold treatment while ao activities increased only moderately under these conditions. crude extract were obtained from three independent treatment , indicating that nfs1/isd <dig> are required for  cluster assembly on both proteins tested.

discussion
soybean is a paleopolypoid plant, whose polyploidisation may have occurred in the common ancestor of the soybean and medicago truncatula. in addition, it was suggested that a relatively recent polyploidy event occurred in the soybean lineage  <cit> . all analyzed genes are present in duplicate on different chromosomes showing a high degree of conservation and share important characteristics  <cit> . due to the polyploidy events, mutations and gene rearrangements occurred, resulting in diversification of gene expression  <cit> . here, we present the characterization of the promoters of soybean nfs1and nfs <dig> genes, and identified tissue- and stress-specific response in expression of cysteine desulfurase and isd <dig> genes both involved in  cluster biosynthesis.

three different systems responsible for  cluster biosynthesis have been described  <cit> , and involved genes appear to be conserved in bacteria, fungi, animals and plants  <cit> . in our phylogenetic analysis , it was possible to identify three distinct groups, composed of proteins from isc, nif and suf systems. g. max protein sequences were located in plant clades near to m. truncatula. comparing our phylogenetic approach and the described polyploidy events  <cit> , it was possible to hypothesize that analyzed cysteine desulfurase genes were duplicated after the divergence of soybean and m. truncatula. thus, soybean has two copies of each cysteine desulfurase gene, while m. truncatula has only one copy . both species contain duplicated isd <dig> genes . therefore, this polyploidy event may have occurred prior to divergence of both lines.

the present results suggest that nfs <dig> and nfs <dig> soybean genes, which encode proteins involved in sulfur assimilation and  cluster biosynthesis  <cit> , are involved in response to cold stress and sa. sulfur is an essential macronutrient which is assimilated to cysteine  <cit> , which will take part in the assembly of sdcs. when exposed to biotic and/or abiotic stress, synthesis of sdcs is induced via different signals, demonstrating their potential involvement in stress defense. there is an increased demand for cysteine as a precursor due to sdcs synthesis; therefore, the expression of genes for sulfur assimilation is induced  <cit> . analyzing cold-treated plants, it is possible to observe that, in leaves, nfs <dig> and nfs <dig> genes increased transcript levels , perhaps due to sdcs stress response or due to its possible role in sdcs synthesis. when treated with sa, a simulator of biotic stress, nfs <dig> genes changed their expression pattern . in both experiments we observed a particular expression pattern, i.e. organs with primary contact to the stressor showed an increase in cysteine desulfurase transcript levels, while those less exposed showed a lower expression . this opposite profile may be due to a compensatory mechanism present in early stress response, and it may change if plants are exposed to longer stress periods.

when the plant cell are exposed to biotic or abiotic stress factors, modifications of the lipid composition of its membranes occur  <cit> . soybean mitochondria show modifications in lipid content in response to low temperature  <cit> , and this can alter respiratory properties and gene expression  <cit> . as many proteins involved in respiration, such as complexes i, ii and iii, are fe-s proteins  <cit> , a modification in the respiratory profile may change the requirement for proteins of the  cluster biosynthesis pathway, i.e. altering the expression of cysteine desulfurase genes. stress dependent changes in gene expression occur in the cytoplasm as well as in chloroplasts. whereas mitochondria developed an export system for  clusters that is essential for maturation of many nuclear and cytosolic proteins,  cluster biosynthesis in mitochondria has a direct impact on protein activity, such as for aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase  <cit>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the chloroplast is extremely sensitive to abiotic stress factors, such as elevated temperature and light, both increasing reactive oxygen species. glutathione is involved in protection against oxidative damage triggered by biotic and abiotic stress in the cytosol and other cellular compartments. synthesis of this peptide depends on sulfur assimilation and cysteine synthesis  <cit> , as this amino acid is the substrate of cysteine desulfurase  <cit> , a change in cysteine content may lead to a modification in its catalytic properties.

sa and its methylated form are involved in development, and are also fundamental for hypersensitive response and for systemic acquired resistance under biotic stress  <cit> . sa can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species, and these can react with various molecules in the cell, including lipids. as the organelle is often exposed to strong oxidative stress, some antioxidant enzymes should be simultaneously upregulated. an alternative oxidase has been proposed to represent a functional marker for mitochondrial dysfunction during biotic stress, and its content is increased in sa-treated soybean  <cit> . the treatment with sa causes mitochondrial dysfunction via oxidative stress causing changes in the cysteine desulfurase expression. this enzyme transfers electrons from reduced ubiquinone to molecular oxygen, bypassing complexes iii and iv  <cit> , and complex iii contains  cluster  <cit> . in addition, sa-treated soybean altered the fatty acid composition of its mitochondria. as these organelles modified their membranes upon sa treatment, and cellular respiration involves fe-s proteins, the expression of cysteine desulfurase may be altered under biotic stress.

the present quantitative rt-pcr results revealed a relationship between nfs <dig> and isd <dig> transcript contents in roots and leaves as both genes showed a similar expression pattern . moreover, to analyze whether an increase in nfs <dig> expression triggers an increase in isd <dig> transcript levels, we studied isd <dig> expression levels under cold stress. in roots, total isd <dig> mrna decreased during the treatment and recovered to the initial level after  <dig> h, while nfs <dig> transcript levels did not change. in leaves, both genes were upregulated . the similarity in expression pattern between these genes may be explained by their function. nfs <dig> is a cysteine desulfurase involved in  biosynthesis in mitochondria  <cit> , whereas isd <dig> was recently identified in yeast as a protein responsible for forming a stable complex with nfs <dig>  <cit> . besides interacting with the cysteine desulfurase, isd <dig> showed in humans an important role in mitochondrial and cytosolic iron homeostasis  <cit>  mediated by nfs <dig>  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that interaction between mitochondrial genes nfs1/isd <dig> increased expression and maturation of cytosolic enzymes xdh and ao. these results corroborate with data described for yeast, which associates the mitochondrial machinery for  cluster biosynthesis as being responsible for maturation of cytosolic fe-s proteins. also, results in figure  <dig>  show, for the first time, a direct relation among increase expression of both cytosolic fe-s protein  and mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase as a result of cold stress conditions. moreover, our results are in agreement with the experiments involved co-expression of nfs <dig> and isd <dig> of a. thaliana, which show a higher stability of nfs <dig> when co-expressed with isd <dig> may suggesting that the interaction of nfs1/isd <dig> promote the correct conformational structure of nfs <dig> .

the soybean genome contains highly similar genes integrated in wider regulatory networks involved in differential regulation, including the presence of cis-acting regulatory elements in promoter regions  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed dna sequences to predict putative transcription factor binding sites located in the - <dig> bp promoter regions. duplicated genes have highly homologous promoter regions . when cis-elements were compared, all genes share high degree of common binding sites , suggesting that cysteine desulfurase genes share regulatory networks. in spite of this similarity, it has been shown that different environmental factors may trigger gene expression . since a complex molecular network is involved in regulation of gene expression and transcription factors are important components that lead to activation or repression of transcription  <cit> , the differences observed may be due to the requirements of the corresponding factors in a particular tissue or organelle. the analysis of transcription factor binding sites provided an insight into transcript level data. cis-elements related to quantitative rt-pcr experiments are shown in table  <dig>  a py-rich element was found in nfs1_chr <dig> and nfs2_chr <dig> genes that showed high transcription levels in leaves and in both leaves and roots, respectively. an are element was found in nfs1_chr <dig>  which displayed higher expression in roots than in leaves, whereas promoters with an as-2-box element showed higher expression in leaves. the tca-element, related to sa response, was found in nfs <dig> genes that changed transcription pattern under this stress. besides, all genes had cis-elements related to defense and stress  and to drought response , and several genes are induced by both drought and cold stress, indicating a crosstalk between signaling pathways  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we carried out an analysis of cysteine desulfurase genes from soybean, which are involved in  cluster biosynthesis. this study suggests that nfs <dig> and nfs <dig> genes are involved in stress response, and that their differential expression may be due to the presence of different cis-elements . furthermore, isd <dig> displayed an expression pattern similar to nfs <dig> genes, supporting a positive correlation in their activity. our results provide the first insight into differential expression of duplicated genes involved in  cluster pathway, but further research is needed to determine whether other genes involved in  cluster biogenesis follow this pattern.
