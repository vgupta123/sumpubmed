BACKGROUND
the cultivated peanut or groundnut, arachis hypogaea l.,  is a major crop in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world, with 68% of groundnut cultivated world-wide produced in asia , 24% in africa  and the remaining 8%  from north america, the caribbean, europe and oceania  <cit> . the seeds are used for direct human consumption, and as an oil and protein source  <cit> . additionally, plant residues are extremely important as fodder for cattle in many regions of the world  <cit> . the crop is becoming increasingly important as an income source in tree plantations before tree crops mature. in africa and asia, groundnut is intercropped between maize, sorghum, and soybean or, in a few areas, between mature coconut trees  <cit> .

in contrast to the wealth of phenotypic diversity observed within cultivated groundnut, the genetic diversity observed to date within the cultivated gene-pool is much lower. this low level of genetic variation in cultivated groundnut is attributed to its origin from a single polyploidization event that occurred relatively recently on an evolutionary time scale  <cit> . however, additional contributing factors to the low levels of molecular polymorphism observed to date could be the marker techniques used and the amount of diversity of samples tested  <cit> .

molecular markers, in general, and microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  in particular have proven very useful for crop improvement in many species  <cit> . in groundnut, the use of molecular markers for breeding applications, however, has been limited by the low level of the genetic variation in this species. nevertheless, in recent years, significant efforts have been made to develop the ssr markers in groundnut  <cit> . development of ssr markers traditionally requires cloning and sequencing and hence is more cost and labour-intensive, compared to pcr arbitrary priming techniques e.g. randomly amplified polymorphic dnas , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> . however, once the ssr markers are developed, their applications in breeding activities particularly using high throughput approaches becomes very cost effective. to isolate the ssrs from genomic dna libraries, several approaches for creating ssr-enriched genomic libraries have been developed, with ssr selection either before  <cit>  or after genomic library construction  <cit> .

by using different approaches, >  <dig> ssrs have been developed in groundnut  <cit> . by using these ssr markers, good progress has been made in developing the genetic maps and diversity studies in aa- and bb-genome groundnut species  <cit> . in case of cultivated germplasm, however, these ssr markers showed very low level of polymorphism  <cit> . this is one of the reasons that despite the availability of moderate number of ssr markers in groundnut, not a single genetic map based on cultivated germplasm has been published so far. to overcome the low level of polymorphism, one of simple solutions will be to develop a critical number of ssr markers in groundnut so that a repertoire of about 200– <dig> polymorphic ssr markers for cultivated groundnut germplasm may be available.

the present study was initiated in order to isolate and characterize new microsatellite markers from groundnut, following a microsatellite enriched genomic library approach. the overall aim of this study is to enhance the repertoire of polymorphic ssr markers for cultivated groundnut germplasm so that genetic mapping and trait mapping could be feasible in cultivated groundnut.

RESULTS
ssr-enriched library
the ssr enriched library was constructed from the genotype tmv <dig> following by modified method of fischer and bachmann  <cit> . this library was enriched for ca and ct ssr repeat motifs. from this library,  <dig>  clones were picked from  <dig> 96-well plates. hybridization of these clones with digoxigenin-labeled ssr probes  provided  <dig>  putatively positive clones. sequencing of these clones indicated the insert size in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp with an average size of  <dig> bp. majority of clones  contained the insert of moderate size  while  <dig> % clones contained small inserts  and  <dig> % clones contained inserts of >  <dig> bp.

analysis of sequence data mentioned above with tandem repeat finder  had  <dig>  clones which contained one or more ssrs. the efficiency of the enrichment procedure for the constructed library was higher as compared to other ssr isolation studies of groundnut. like the present study, 61% of clones were found to contain ssrs in the study of he and colleagues  <cit> , 56% clones had ssrs in the study of gimenes and colleagues  <cit>  and  <dig> % clones were reported to contain ssrs by wang and colleagues  <cit> . however very low enrichment efficiency  were obtained in some other libraries enriched for ssrs  <cit> . indeed, this enrichment efficiency depends on many factors including the choice of restriction enzyme used for library construction, the ssr probes used for enrichment, etc. the approach used in the present study seems to be the most efficient enrichment strategy for ssr isolation in groundnut.

a redundancy level of 26% in the ssr-enriched genomic library was observed through multiple sequence alignment analysis using the clustalw programme; in total  <dig> copies of one clone was observed,  <dig> copies of five clones,  <dig> copies of  <dig> clones and  <dig> copies of  <dig> clones. the rate of redundant ssr-containing clones was found to be comparable  to other studies utilizing microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries in other plant species, e.g., olive tree   <cit> , onion   <cit> . as compared to ssr isolation studies in groundnut where upto 67% redundancy has been observed  <cit> , the strategy employed in the present study seems to be quite effective to isolate a higher proportion of novel and unique ssrs. observed level of redundancy in this study could be explained due to the existence of multiple copies of some ssrs in the groundnut genome, which may be present on both the a and b genomes within cultivated a. hypogaea. the bias observed for some ssrs being repeated in multiple clones could also be explained by the fact that during the enrichment procedure  some fragments can be arbitrarily selected over the rest.

despite the addition of excess adapter during the enrichment procedures,  <dig> % of clones were identified as concatenates, generated during the initial restriction/ligation step, by the presence of internal rsai and mlui restriction sites. another type of concatenation may be formed during the pcr step of the enrichment cloning procedure  <cit> . such chimeras usually remain undetected and may result in the failure of some primer pairs to amplify genomic dna templates in the evaluation of primers  <cit> .

occurrence and features of ssrs
sequence analysis of  <dig> clones showed the presence of one or more ssrs in  <dig>  clones. following the definitions of weber  <cit> ,  <dig> % of the ssrs identified were perfect,  <dig> % were imperfect  and  <dig> % were compound  with  <dig> % being compound perfect and  <dig> % being compound imperfect. similar kind of distribution of different ssr classes was observed in different ssr isolation studies in groundnut  <cit> .

in terms of the repeat motifs, the gt/ca repeat motif was the most common, accounting for  <dig> % of all repeat types, followed by ga/ct repeat at  <dig> %. the previous surveys carried out on microsatellite abundance in plant genomes have shown at as the most frequently occurring dinucleotide repeat motifs followed by ag/ct and gt/ca  <cit> . the at repeat is self-complementary and is difficult to screen for by colony hybridization, hence the library was not enriched for at. abundance of ga/ct, gt/ca, at and att repeat motifs in isolated ssrs in groundnut in the present study is in agreement with earlier reports on isolation of ssrs in groundnut  <cit> . the use of separate ga and gt filters could increase the ability of detecting perfect ga/ct and gt/ca repeat motifs or the frequency of the repeats, in comparison to using mixtures of different repeat motifs in the same hybridization. however several studies have shown the retrieval of higher proportion of compound ssrs  when the library was enriched using a mixture of different ssr oligos  <cit> .

the maximum repeat unit number of dinucleotide repeat motifs of gt/ca and ga/ct were  <dig> and  <dig> units, respectively; the overall repeat motif number ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  in fact, in some studies, the markers developed for longer repeat motifs were found more informative for detection of polymorphism in cultivated groundnut germplasm  <cit> . in addition to gt and ga repeats containing ssrs, several ssrs containing the repeat motifs- n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n and n with 2– <dig> repeat numbers were also isolated. it was interesting to note that most of the clones containing these repeats had an additional repeat of gt/ca or ga/ct. gimenes and colleagues  <cit>  also observed 37% ssrs with different repeats, like in the present study, that were not totally complementary sequences to the oligonucelotide probes used. however, the repeat motif att is highly abundant and informative in several legume species like soybean  <cit> , chickpea  <cit>  and pea  <cit>  was not observed abundant in the present study. in case of groundnut, many reports are available on isolation and distribution of ssrs, only two studies  <cit>  indicated the abundance of aat repeat motifs. in the present study, as only  <dig> clones sequenced were selected randomly from the set of  <dig> clones, probably sequencing of larger number of clones could have showed the abundance of aat repeat motifs.

marker development
ssr containing sequences were used for primer designing using primer <dig> programme. following the standard criteria: primer length- 18– <dig> bp; tm- 57–63°c; gc content – 40–60%, maximum tm difference between forward and reverse primer –  <dig> °c, primer pairs were designed for  <dig> ssr containing clones . of this set,  <dig> % primer pairs were designed for perfect repeats,  <dig> % for imperfect repeats while the remaining  <dig> % for compound repeats. for the remaining sequences, the primer designing could not be possible as in some cases sequence quality was poor while in some cases the ssrs were too near the start or end of the insert. the percentage of primers designed, in relation to the number of clones sequenced  is higher than some studies in groundnut like moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit>  , he and colleagues  <cit>   and ferguson and colleagues  <cit>   while lower than some other reports such as moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit>   and wang and colleagues  <cit>  . this may be attributed to the size range of insert, the restriction enzyme used for genomic dna library construction and the approach used for ssr enrichment, etc.  <cit> .

newly designed ssr markers were tested for amplification on two genotypes i.e. tmv <dig> and icg  <dig>  of this set, only  <dig>  primer pairs yielded the scorable amplicon in the genotypes examined . the functionality of the primer pairs is comparatively lower than the studies of ferguson and colleagues  <cit>  and moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit>  who observed amplification in  <dig> % and  <dig> % cases, respectively. it is noteworthy that several pcr profiles and pcr optimization strategies were adopted in above mentioned studies, however in the present study to save costs and time, pcr conditions for non-amplifiable markers were not optimized repeatedly. out of  <dig> working primers,  <dig>  primer pairs were optimized on 65°c -60°c touch down profile,  <dig>  primer pairs optimized on 60°c -55°c touch down profile while only one  primer pair was optimized on 55°c -45°c specific profiles. it is quite likely to increase the rate of functionality of newly developed markers by using different pcr conditions and profiles.

it is also noted that the markers for less than  <dig> repeat units produced amplicons in about 73% cases, while the markers containing the higher number of repeat units  yielded amplicon in  <dig> % –  <dig> % cases only. it is possible that higher number of repeat units make the taq polymerase unstable that makes it unable to extend alongwith the template dna  <cit> .

ssr polymorphism
in order to assess the potential of newly developed ssr marker for detecting the polymorphism in 4× groundnut genotypes, all the  <dig> primer pairs yielding pcr products were tested on the set of  <dig> genotypes . as a result, only  <dig>  markers showed polymorphism in the germplasm analyzed . of the  <dig> primers,  <dig> primers were for perfect ssrs while  <dig> primers were for imperfect ssrs. marker polymorphism observed in the present study is higher or comparable to earlier studies on ssr diversity in cultivated groundnut germplasm. for example, in two different studies, he and colleagues observed polymorphism with  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> % markers  <cit>  while  <dig> % markers showed polymorphism in the study of moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit> . in all these studies, the ssr markers, like in the present study, were isolated from the genomic dna libraries. it seems that either the ssr markers developed in the present study are more informative or the germplasm surveyed here is more diverse. higher informativeness of the newly developed markers is supported by the general theory that degree of polymorphism of the ssr marker increases with the total length of the repeat  <cit> . the majority of the markers  developed here contained more than  <dig> repeat units for the corresponding ssrs . however, ferguson and colleagues  <cit>  observed higher  marker polymorphism as compared to this study which can be attributed to the diverse nature of the germplasm examined in their study.

in recent years, ssr markers have been developed from the expressed sequence tags  because of increasing the emphasis on developing the functional molecular markers  <cit> . luo and colleagues  <cit>  had 20% of the markers showing polymorphisms; while moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit>  detected polymorphisms in cultivated germplasm with  <dig> % of the markers. lower level of polymorphism of est-based ssr markers can be attributed to their origin from highly conserved proportion of the genome  <cit> . in our opinion, the crops like groundnut having narrow genetic background needs higher number of ssr markers derived from genomic dna library instead from cdna library or ests.

the numbers of alleles detected by the set of  <dig> polymorphic markers were in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus . the pic value for these polymorphic markers varied from  <dig>   –  <dig>   with an average of  <dig>  . when looking at ssr classes and motifs, the trinucleotide ssrs showed higher allele numbers  and pic values  followed by dinucleotide  and compound ssrs . among dinucleotide ssrs, ga/ct repeat motifs exhibited more informativeness  as compared to gt/ca repeat motifs . ferguson and colleagues  <cit>  as well as moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit>  observed higher informativeness of ga/ct repeat motifs. therefore to develop more polymorphic markers for cultivated groundnut, we propose to isolate and develop the ga/ct repeat based ssr markers.

to understand the possible relationship between polymorphism of ssr markers with the repeat unit length of the corresponding ssrs, two scatter plots were made between repeat unit length and number of alleles detected  and the pic value calculated . the scatter plot between number of alleles and repeat unit length shows the widest variation in number of alleles was between  <dig> and  <dig> repeats and a lower number of alleles found in the low number or very high number repeats. however it does not provide any conclusive relationships between the number of alleles and repeat unit length as indicated by ferguson and colleagues  <cit>  and moretzsohn and colleagues  <cit>  that loci with longer repeats are much more likely to be more variable. indeed, among the polymorphic ssr markers, the ipahm  <dig> marker containing highest number of repeat units  provided just  <dig> alleles while the ipahm  <dig> markers with  <dig> repeat units long ssr revealed the highest number of alleles . this is possible as the majority of the polymorphic ssr markers detected  <dig> and  <dig> alleles in the present study.

the scatter plot between pic value and repeat unit length indicates that the higher pic values  were between  <dig> and  <dig> repeats while lower pic values were found in the low number  or very high number  repeats. it is noteworthy that the relationship appeared to be ssr class specific as it was more consistent for the compound ssrs. as no other report, to the best of our knowledge, is available on relationship between pic value and repeat unit length in groundnut, a direct comparison of the observed results could not be possible.

based on our investigations on relationship of repeat unit length with number of alleles or pic value, no consistent relationship between the number of repeat units and ssr polymorphism was observed. it has been reported earlier that the degree of polymorphism increases with the total length of the repeat  <cit> , some other studies including in groundnut showed no relationship or weak correlation between ssr polymorphism and repeat unit length  <cit> .

diversity analysis and genetic relationships
based on the unique dna fingerprint profiles of each accession of cultivated groundnut obtained by the polymorphic markers, a phenogram was constructed to understand the relationships among the cultivated groundnut germplasm surveyed. the dendrogram based on dice similarity coefficient and constructed using the darwin programme classified the germplasm in four main clusters a, b, c and d . the cluster a contained  <dig> genotypes, the cluster b contained  <dig> genotypes while the other two clusters namely c and d contained  <dig> and  <dig> genotypes, respectively. under each of these main clusters, genotypes were grouped further into sub clusters. for instance, the cluster a contained four subclusters  and the cluster b  and c  contained two subclusters each.

majority of the genotypes  representing subspecies hypogaea  were found in the main cluster a. the genotypes belonging to fastigiata subspecies were grouped mainly under the main clusters b and c. the grouping of genotypes representing two subspecies in different clusters agrees with the classification of groundnut botanical varieties  <cit> . however, in an earlier study  <cit>  genotypes representing the two subspecies were classified in only two groups.

the cluster b contained  <dig>  genotypes belonging to variety fastigiata and three genotypes belonging to variety vulgaris. the cluster c also contained the genotypes from the fastigiata subspecies that includes  <dig> genotypes of variety fastigiata,  <dig> to variety peruviana and one each from varieties vulgaris and aequatoriana. the cluster d contained only  <dig> genotypes belonging to subspecies fastigiata. majority of the nodes under the main clusters were supported by high bootstrap values.

it is important to note that positioning of botanical varieties aequatoriana and peruviana to the subspecies fastigiata or hypogaea has been debatable in the literature. for instance, in the past, based on morphological and physiological traits, two botanical varieties were classified under the subspecies fastigiata  while aflp markers suggested relationships of aequatoriana and peruviana to hypogaea rather than subspecies fastigiata  <cit> . the present study included only two aequatoriana and three peruviana genotypes, and they were grouped under all three major clusters . nevertheless, like the observations of he and prakash  <cit> , four out of the five genotypes representing aequatoriana and peruviana subspecies showed closer relationships with the hypogaea genotypes  while only one genotype of peruviana subspecies  showed some proximity to subspecies fastigiata. the botanical variety peruviana, based on rapd and issr marker data, was classified as an operational taxonomic unit in addition to four varieties i.e. fastigiata, vulgaris , runner and bunch   <cit> .

it is interesting to note that the two accessions with resistance to leaf rust  were grouped together  and similarly the other two accessions resistance to late leaf spot  were grouped together . it seems that genotypes resistant to leaf rust and late leaf spot shared the pedigree or have the same resource of resistance. however, three accessions resistance to early leaf spot  were scattered in the dendrogram. the accession, tmv <dig>  susceptible to all three diseases  was present under cluster b. the dendrogram suggests the potential parental genotypes having higher genetic diversity for constructing the mapping population for mapping the leaf rust, late leaf spot and early leaf spot. even selection and utilization of diverse cultivars in breeding programmes is needed to enhance the diversity of breeding populations for selection gains in the future  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study highlight a reliable and efficient way of obtaining microsatellites markers from cultivated groundnut. it is desirable to isolate and characterize more dna markers in cultivated groundnut for more productive genomic studies, such as genetic mapping, marker-assisted selection, and gene discovery. construction and sequencing of ssr enriched library yielded a total of  <dig> ssrs, however, primer pairs could be designed for only  <dig> ssrs of which  <dig> primer pairs showed the functionality. as a result, the present study contributes a new set of  <dig> ssr markers for cultivated groundnut. in order to assess the potential of newly developed markers for germplasm analysis, screening of these markers on  <dig> genotypes showed reasonable level of polymorphism. newly developed markers detected on average  <dig>  alleles per locus with an average pic value  <dig> . the present study also provided some indications about nature and type of repeat class or length of ssrs on the polymorphism of corresponding ssr marker. finally, the ssr markers, developed in this study would be very useful for germplasm analysis, population genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships.
