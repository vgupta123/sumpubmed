BACKGROUND
the cultivated apple, malus pumila mill. , is a member of the spireaoideae subfamily of rosaceae, and is the fourth most economically-important fruit crop worldwide. as a consequence of the long juvenility phase of apple trees and of relatively high husbandry costs, the breeding and selection of novel apple rootstocks and scions is a time-consuming and costly procedure. marker assisted selection  has the potential to increase the precision of apple breeding and an essential prerequisite to mas is the production of high quality saturated genetic linkage maps to enable marker-trait associations to be made.

the genome of the apple scion cultivar ‘golden delicious’ was recently sequenced and assembled into  <dig> pseudo-chromosomes by an international consortium  <cit>  using predominantly second generation  <dig> sequencing technology. despite the inherent difficulties associated with contig assembly and gene-prediction in complex heterozygous genomes  <cit> , the ‘golden delicious’ genome covers  <dig>  mbp, an estimated  <dig> % of the malus genome and almost complete coverage of the gene-space of the variety  <cit> , with an average depth of sequencing  <dig> ×. thus, the sequence provides a solid foundation for a wealth of downstream research activities including marker development, linkage map construction and marker-trait association.

the availability of data relating to single nucleotide polymorphisms  from early in the development of the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence meant that assays have been developed for screening segregating snps in apple mapping populations at relatively high throughput using the snplex and golden gate genotyping platforms  <cit> , permitting not only the rapid development of linkage maps for malus progenies, but the high resolution anchoring orientation of the scaffolded sequence data to a reference linkage map  <cit> . the degree of transferability of heterozygous snps between malus varieties and species, and between malus and pyrus has recently been assessed  <cit> , and estimates have been made about the number of snps required to allow the construction of a saturated linkage map in any given malus progeny. in the study of micheletti et al.  <cit> , snps identified from the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence were validated and tested for heterozygous transferability  in a diverse selection of malus germplasm. the investigation showed that snps identified within the ‘golden delicious’ sequence had an average transferability rate of  <dig> % to malus cultivars, with the lowest tsnp to the cultivar ‘wagner’  from those tested. the transferability rate in rootstock germplasm was between  <dig> % and  <dig> %, whilst to an accession of pyrus pyrifolia, the tsnp value was just  <dig> %, demonstrating low cross-genera snp transferability of the snps tested  <cit> .

through international collaboration, led by the rosbreed initiative in the usa  <cit> , the malus research community has developed an infinium® ii wgg genotyping array  for malus and pyrus using data from the re-sequencing of  <dig> malus genotypes along with data from the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence. the irsc array contains a total of  <dig>  malus snps  <cit>  in addition to  <dig> pyrus snps. the development of this array represents a milestone in the development of molecular genetics and genomics resources for malus and offers the promise of rapid, low-cost, high-throughput genotyping for the purposes of linkage map construction and the genotyping of germplasm collections, that will facilitate future qtl and genome-wide association studies. however, reports are yet to emerge of the efficacy of such arrays for genotyping germplasm and mapping populations from divergent sources or from species related to those for which they were originally designed.

the m <dig> mapping progeny  <cit>  has been raised for the study of genes controlling traits of relevance to rootstock breeding, with the long-term aim of developing robust markers for mas. since the progeny is derived from parental rootstock varieties, the genetic basis of the seedlings that comprise the population represents a departure from the well-characterised scion genotypes that were used to identify snps for the construction of the irsc array  <cit> . the progeny has been previously characterised with s-locus-specific markers, and  <dig>  ssr markers  <cit>  distributed throughout the malus genome. a comprehensive consensus linkage map of the progeny has been developed spanning  <dig> linkage groups , with an average marker density of one marker every  <dig>  cm. the linkage map was partially anchored to the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence, and a total of 47% of the sequence that was contained in metacontigs could be assigned positions on the m <dig> map.

the aim of this investigation was to test the irsc array in the m <dig> rootstock mapping progeny to determine its utility to genome-wide saturated map construction. additionally, we aimed to increase the percentage of the malus genome sequence that could be directly related to regions of the m <dig> linkage map for the purposes of candidate gene identification and marker development following qtl analysis. we evaluated the snp-based linkage map produced against the previously-published ssr-based linkage map of the population developed by fernández-fernández et al.  <cit> . we compared the positions of snp markers on the m <dig> linkage map with their predicted positions on the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence and assessed the accuracy of the genomic placement of the heterozygous snp markers in relation to the genetic positions of the markers on the m <dig> map. an evaluation was made of the ease at which the irsc array could be implemented in the mapping progeny in relation to previous ssr assays performed for linkage map construction in this progeny.

RESULTS
snp heterozygosity in the m <dig> mapping progeny
gentrain scores for all snps scored in the m <dig> progeny ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> . cluster separation ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> . of the  <dig>  snp markers contained on the irsc array ,  <dig> markers failed in both parental genotypes,  <dig> failed in the ‘m.27’ genotype and a further  <dig> markers failed in the ‘m.116’ genotype. a total of  <dig>  markers were homozygous in both parental genotypes of the m <dig> progeny, and  <dig> revealed unexpected genotypes in the progeny given the parental genotypes. of the remaining  <dig>  markers  <dig>  were heterozygous in both parents,  <dig> markers were heterozygous only in the ‘m.27’ parental genotype, and  <dig> markers were heterozygous only in ‘m.116’.

snp and ssr co-segregation analysis and linkage map construction
gentrain scores for the markers considered for mapping ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> . cluster separation scores ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . a total of  <dig> snps heterozygous in the ‘m.27’ parental genotype,  <dig> snps heterozygous in the ‘m.116’ parental genotype, and a further  <dig> snps heterozygous in both parental genotypes of the m <dig> progeny coalesced into the  <dig> expected lgs for a consensus genetic linkage map. thus, a total of  <dig> putatively segregating loci were not located to lgs on the m <dig> map. close visual inspection of these loci in genomestudio  revealed that the majority had poor cluster separation scores and did not cluster as expected despite having high gentrain scores. in many cases, the clusters that were produced were composed of a number of smaller sub-clusters and of individual genotype calls that did not cluster tightly or that did not cluster in the expected region of the graph space and were shifted from either the  <dig> or the  <dig> axis . as such, cluster patterns at these loci were either unsuitable for genotypic analysis due to mis-assignation of sub-clusters, or it was not possible to reliably determine the heterozygosity status of the parental genotypes, and thus the loci were not considered for further analyses.

in addition to the  <dig> snps, the  <dig> codominant ssr markers and the s-locus that were previously mapped by fernández-fernández et al.  <cit>  were located to the  <dig> lgs. previously mapped dominant ssr markers segregating aØ × aØ were not considered for mapping in this investigation. the consensus linkage map of the m <dig> progeny is presented in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> summarises the marker composition and lengths of the 17 m <dig> lgs. the map spanned a total of  <dig> .2 cm and contained a total of  <dig>  molecular markers. lg  <dig> was the shortest lg on the map, spanning  <dig>  cm, whilst lg <dig> was the longest, spanning  <dig>  cm. the highest number of markers mapped to a single lg was  <dig> on lg2; the smallest number of markers on a single lg was  <dig> on lg <dig>  the map had an average marker density of one marker every  <dig>  cm. the linkage map contained a total of three regions in excess of 10 cm that contained no mapped molecular markers.

the total number of snp and ssr markers mapped in the m <dig> mapping progeny, the number of markers per chromosome and the total length of each lg in centi-morgans .

the largest region to which no markers were mapped was  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> which was defined by four ssr markers that had been previously mapped by fernández-fernández et al.  <cit> . similarly, a region at the distal end of lg <dig> spanning  <dig>  cm containing no markers was defined by a single ssr marker previously mapped by fernández-fernández et al.  <cit> . upon closer inspection, the segregation of these ssr loci were distorted towards an excess of an allele from ‘m.27’ parental genotype which could have potentially led to an overestimation of the genetic distance between these markers and their closest flanking markers along the lg. the markers were tentatively included on the linkage map presented since their position and order corresponded with the previously published m <dig> linkage map.

segregation distortion on the m <dig> linkage map
a total of six lgs exhibited some level of segregation distortion along their length . of these, two  displayed segregation distortion for a short region at their proximal end, whilst the distortion observed on the other four groups  was more extensive, the most significant distortion present on lg <dig> and on lg <dig> in the region of the s-locus.

comparison of genetic and physical positions of the irsc array snp markers
discussion
we have extended the previously published m <dig> genetic linkage map using snp markers generated using the irsc array, and increased marker saturation on the map from an average of one marker every  <dig>  cm to one marker every  <dig>  cm. of the  <dig>  malus snp markers contained on the array,  <dig>   were heterozygous in one of the two parents of the progeny, and a further  <dig>  were heterozygous in both parental genotypes. a total of  <dig> heterozygous snps were derived from the  <dig> pyrus snps on the array, indicating a tsnp value of  <dig> % transferability to malus, which is within the range of values previously obtained by micheletti et al.  <cit>  of between  <dig>  and 3% transferability of snps from malus to pyrus. the total percentage of heterozygous malus snps  was within the tsnp value range reported for the transferability of ‘golden delicious’ snps to rootstock varieties  <cit> , indicating that previously reported tsnp values for malus cultivars should be broadly applicable to the number of snps expected to segregate in a given malus genotype on the irsc array.

snp marker heterozygosity and genomestudio genotype clustering
our investigation revealed a large number of snps putatively heterozygous and thus segregating in the m <dig> progeny, but for which genotype calls using genomestudio  resulted in segregation patterns that could not be assigned a position on one of the  <dig> lgs of the m <dig> consensus map. a closer inspection of the genotype data in genomestudio  revealed low cluster separation calls for all snps and a number of different causes for the discrepancies in these data, including many loci for which data were grouped into more than one sub-cluster in each genotype. sub-clusters are most likely caused by probes detecting more than one locus, one of which contained an snp or indel, or the detection of more than one allele containing snps within the probe sequence  <cit> , leading to non-uniform clustering of the detected genotypes. such variation has been detected using oligonucleotide arrays in humans, where it is attributed to copy-number variation   <cit> . sanzol  <cit>  investigated duplicated genes in malus using est data and concluded that the data supported a model of continuous small-scale duplication events, in addition to the recent whole genome duplication event in the lineage of the genus  <cit> . we suggest that the apparently large number of loci for which segregation data was generated using the irsc array, but which could not be located to the m <dig> linkage map  is a result of a combination of factors, including detection of paralogous loci generated through whole genome duplication and cnv, and the mis-assignation of genotypes scored in genomestudio  due to the lack of a well defined cluster file for the analysis of malus.

snp and ssr co-segregation analysis and linkage map construction
to our knowledge, this is the most extensive linkage map of a malus mapping progeny published to date. previously, the irsc array had been used to genotype the progeny derived from the cross ‘royal gala’ × ‘granny smith’  which was reported by chagné et al.  <cit> , although in the report, data from only a single lg  was presented. the number of snp markers heterozygous in the m <dig> population was  <dig>  , almost identical to the  <dig>   reported to be heterozygous in rg × gs by chagné et al.  <cit> . of those markers heterozygous in the m <dig> progeny,  <dig>  markers could be assigned reliable positions on the linkage map presented. since only one lg was presented in the report of chagné et al.  <cit> , it was not possible to determine if all  <dig>  markers were located to the rg × gs linkage map. additionally as only markers segregating in a ‘pseudo test-cross’ configuration were presented on the rg × gs lg <dig> parental linkage maps and the m <dig> progeny is derived from a back-cross between ‘m.27’ and its semi-vigourous seedling ‘m.116’ , direct comparison between the number of markers mapped in both investigations was not possible. however, the average distance between markers on the rg × gs linkage map was reported to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the ‘royal gala’ and ‘granny smith’ linkage maps respectively. these distances are comparable to the average genetic distances between the same marker types in this investigation  and thus we conclude that, given the diverse pedigrees of these two mapping progenies, the irsc array should be an invaluable tool for linkage map development and saturation in any given m. pumila mapping progeny.

we identified a number of regions of the m <dig> map where segregation distortion was widespread and extensive. the most extreme example was at the bottom of lg <dig> where the self-incompatibility is located  <cit> . the m <dig> progeny was derived from a semi-compatible cross between ‘m.27’ and its semi-vigourous seedling ‘m.116’ , and thus fertilisation could not occur in homozygous genotype combinations around the s-locus, leading to the observed segregation distortion. two other regions of distortion are probably the result of genes associated with the dwarfing phenotype in the cross, since some seedlings of the progeny displayed lethal and sub-lethal dwarf phenotypes. efforts are on-going to characterise the m <dig> progeny and identify qtl associated with the dwarfing phenotype as well as a number of other traits including water-use efficiency.

genome heterozygosity, snp marker genome coverage and a comparison of genetic and physical snp positions
when the genetic positions of the  <dig>  malus snp markers mapped in the m <dig> progeny were compared to their physical positions on the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence a high degree of colinearity was observed. additionally, distinct regions of high and low recombination could be observed in a number of cases along the lgs/pseudochromosomes. the anchored portion of the ‘golden delicious’ genome from which the physical positions of the snps mapped in the m <dig> progeny were derived covers an estimated  <dig> % of the ‘golden delicious’ genome and represents the majority of the gene-rich portion of the apple genome sequence  <cit> . since the un-sequenced and un-anchored portions of the genome have been predicted to be largely repetitive sequence, and the snps positioned on the irsc array were derived almost exclusively from exonic sequence  <cit> , it was expected that plots of genetic and physical positions of the snps mapped in the m <dig> progeny would reveal a largely linear relationship for each chromosome due to the absence of markers mapped to the largely repetitive centromeric and telomeric regions of the chromosomes. however, many of the plots revealed non-linear relationships, with clear regions of high recombination representing chromosome arms, and centres of low recombination representing putative centromeric regions, as have been observed in similar plots of other organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans <cit>  and oryza sativa <cit> . regions of effectively zero recombination at the lg ends which would indicate the presence of telomeric regions were largely undetected in this investigation. however, at least one region of zero recombination was observed on plots of lg/pseudochromosomes lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> 

a total of  <dig> snp markers  were located to positions on lgs that conflicted with the predicted positions of the snps on the ‘golden delicious’ pseudo-chromosomes  <cit> . upon closer inspection of the predicted positions of these snp markers,  <dig>  mapped to regions in the m <dig> mapping progeny that were homeologous to those predicted, whilst the remaining  <dig>  were located in non-homeologous regions of the genome, indicating the presence of paralogous genomic regions, or possible mis-assignment of genome sequence contigs during the assembly and anchoring of the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence.

human and animal genetics employ genetic information gained from individuals who are members of extended pedigrees for the identification of loci controlling complex genetic traits  <cit> . one of the aims of the irsc was to produce a genotyping tool to enable the determination of snp haplotypes for apple varieties related through well-defined pedigrees  <cit> , leading to the identification of genes controlling important agronomic traits using a pedigree-based analysis. the advantages of such analyses are that the full variation associated with a trait of interest can be sampled within a gene pool; however, it is essential that markers included in each haplotype are derived from physically associated locations on the malus genome. if the  <dig> % of the markers mapped in the m <dig> progeny in this investigation that were identified as misplaced on the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence of velasco et al.  <cit> , had been used to create haplotypes for pedigree-based association studies, they would have exhibited recombination at higher frequencies than linked markers within the haplotype, making genetic data within the pedigree difficult or impossible to interpret. in total,  <dig>   of the snp markers contained on the irsc array were mapped in the m <dig> progeny. if the markers mapped in the m <dig> progeny are representative of all snps contained on the array, there are potentially a further  <dig> snps for which the genetic and predicted genomic positions may disagree, potentially leading to the creation of false haplotypes for malus cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
we have employed the irsc malus array to extend and saturate the ssr linkage map of the m <dig> mapping progeny. the use of the array enabled us to locate a total of  <dig>  snps to the consensus linkage map at a fraction of the time and cost of developing a similar map using other experimental approaches, and to develop the most comprehensive saturated complete linkage map for a malus mapping progeny to date. the mapping of the snps enabled us to assess the relative coverage and accuracy of the ‘golden delicious’ genome sequence and to identify a significant proportion  of snps that had been erroneously located to the ‘golden delicious’ pseudochromosomes. further mapping in additional progenies will help to characterise regions of the ‘golden delicious’ sequence that are incorrectly placed in the current assembly version, and assist in the continued improvement of the reference sequence for malus.
