BACKGROUND
atlantic halibut, hippoglossus hippoglossus l., the largest flatfish of atlantic ocean, is a species of commercial interest to the aquaculture industry. halibut's early developmental stages are prolonged and morphologically defined  <cit> . the critical developmental stages, when dramatic changes in signaling, physiology and morphology occur, include:  maternal to zygote transition , when maternally stocked transcripts are degraded and zygote transcripts take control over the development;  organogenesis, when the germ layers are formed;  hatching, when the embryo becomes a free-swimming larva;  first feeding, when active movement, visualization, recognition of prey, and exogenous feeding begin; and  metamorphosis, the most dramatic morphological and behavioral change in a flatfish during the transition from a symmetric post-larval to an asymmetric juvenile stage, when migration of one eye towards the other one occurs across the skull  <cit> .

mirnas are small  non-coding rnas that control and regulate target genes, mostly in a suppressive way  <cit> . in vertebrates, mirnas are important in various developmental processes including mzt, maintenance of cell and tissue identity, organ development, hematopoietic lineage modulation, adipocyte differentiation, and imprinting  <cit> . developmental profiles of mirnas have been reported in few fish species only, including model species such as zebrafish , fugu , tetraodon , and medaka . recently, mirnas have been characterized in atlantic cod , asian seabass  and japanese flounder   <cit> . functional studies have been performed only on zebrafish and medaka  <cit> . these studies showed the conservation of mirna sequences among distantly related teleosts and variations in the expression pattern of selected mirnas during the development  <cit> , and indicated that mirna sequence conservation did not reflect spatial or temporal conservation of expression  <cit> . some species-specific mirnas have been found  <cit> .

isomirs are size variants of mirnas. their occurrence has been observed along with the main mirna types  <cit> , but their origin and possible biological role are not known yet. modifications and size variations have been reported during mirna maturation in different organisms  <cit> . these alterations have been suggested to influence stability, effectiveness, protection or degradation of mature mirnas  <cit> . imperfect cleavage of pri- and/or pre-mirnas by drosha and dicer, respectively, affects mature mirnas size and indicates that size heterogeneity could be an enrichment strategy of mirnas for target diversification  <cit> . isomirs can play important roles under both physiological and disease conditions  <cit> . to our knowledge, differential expressions of isomirs have not yet been shown during ray-finned fish development.

various approaches have been used to characterize and profile mirnas with or/and without prior knowledge of sequences. the solid high throughput sequencing platform has been used to identify and characterize small rnas in various species  <cit> . the depth of coverage from solid platform is a considerable advantage over other comparable platforms, such as the  <dig> pyrosequencing platform  <cit> . we applied high-throughput solid sequencing to identify and profile atlantic halibut mirnas during the development. we discovered putative novel mirnas and isomirs, and demonstrated that isomirs were differentially expressed during halibut development.

RESULTS
sequence statistics and mirna identification
the last  <dig> color reads from the 3' end, which were poor in quality, were removed from all tags . this pre-processing did not affect the actual size of mirnas. about  <dig> million reads were obtained from eight developmental stages of atlantic halibut. out of it,  <dig> % were longer than  <dig> nucleotides, nt . length distribution of all reads showed three peaks , with the majority  being between  <dig> and  <dig> nt long. reads longer than  <dig> nt were composed of  <dig> % mitochondrial transcripts,  <dig> % trna, and  <dig> % rrna sequences. the size distribution of reads that mapped to different databases is shown in additional file  <dig>  on average,  <dig> % of these reads were mapped to known mirnas in all examined developmental stages with the highest percentage  in the first feeding stage and the lowest  in the blastula stage. in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the reads were mapped to halibut ests and to other non-coding rnas, respectively . remaining reads were unmapped.

most of conserved fish mirna families annotated in mirbase release version  <dig> were identified in the present study, with except for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families. the identified families consisted of  <dig> types of conserved mirnas . mirna diversity was increasing along with the developmental advancement .

we found extensive length variation in several mirnas . these modifications were more pronounced at the 3' end, where 46% of mirnas had added bases and 24% had missed bases compared to the reference sequences. likewise, the majority  of mismatches was observed on the last six nucleotides from 3' end of mature mirnas, but 8% of the mirnas showed a mismatch at the first base of the 5' end.

expression profile of conserved mirnas
expression patterns of some mirna families were associated with certain developmental stages . hierarchical clustering showed four major expression patterns: a) early embryonic expression, which might be related to mzt and post-mzt clearance of maternal transcripts; b) embryonic expression, during organogenesis and hatching; c) feeding larvae expression, when larvae undertook exogenous feeding; and d) metamorphosis expression, during larva-to-juvenile transition.

mirna diversity and expression intensity varied among the developmental stages. at early stages , fewer types of mirnas were found than in later stages . the most dominant mirnas at earlier stages belonged to the mir- <dig> family, showing the highest expression during the gastrulation and ceasing after hatching .

among mirnas involved in the pattern formation and maintenance of cellular and tissue identity, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  or mir- <dig> families were relatively highly expressed throughout somitogenesis and hatching , and mir- <dig> family was highly expressed around hatching stage . other mirnas, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> family, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were expressed intensively during the first feeding stage .

peak of expression of a number of mirnas, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was associated with specific developmental transition points .

in some cases the passenger strand mirnas were highly expressed compared to the guide strand. for example, mir-133a* and mir-140* had at least three-fold higher expression compared to their counterparts mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  respectively . at somitogenesis, the expression of mir-133b* was comparable to that of the guide strand, whereas mir-30e* expression at this stage was two times higher than the expression of the guide strand. however, in the later stages, the expression of mir-30e* and mir-133b* was dissipated comparing to their counterparts mir-30e and mir-133b, respectively. in addition, the expression of mir-203b* was higher than mir-203b in all examined stages of the development .

our digital expression profile results were positively validated by rt-qpcr assay .

differential expression of isomirs during halibut development
some mirnas with up to three missed or added nts from the 3' end were expressed differently compared to full-sized mirnas . we found that the expression of isomirs varied and some isomirs showed distinct quantitative patterns throughout the development. this pattern was clearly visible in mir-301c, where single nt-added isomir showed constant increase in the expression from blastula stage towards the juvenile stage, in contrast to the three nts-added isomir in which expression declined during the development . also, single nt-missed and single nt-added isomirs of mir-17a showed the same expression level at blastula stage, but in the later developmental stages they followed opposite trends . truncated mir-19b isomirs showed a reciprocal expression pattern throughout the development compared to the non-truncated counterpart . stage-specific expression pattern of truncated isomirs was observed in mir-203a  and differential expression was observed in other tested isomirs . although most of the added nucleotides were template nucleotides, there were non-template nucleotides in some of the isomirs, such as mir-1- <dig>  mir-125a, mir-203a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> . the prominent non-template nucleotides were uracil or adenine, reaching  <dig> % and  <dig> % of number of reads in mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  respectively. guanine additions were below 1% of reads, and cytosine additions were less than  <dig> % . single nt-additions at 5' end were frequent in mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , mir-22a , and mir- <dig> . single nt additions at 3' end exceeded 60% frequency, in a number of mirnas, such as mir-10b, mir-30c mir-126a, mir-135b, and mir-430d .

we performed cloning and sanger sequencing to verify the presence of isomirs. fifty out of  <dig> sequenced clones had mirnas inserts. these sequences aligned to  <dig> different types of mirnas. clones containing mir- <dig> sequence showed size variations, including three nts truncation and addition at both 5' and 3' ends. untemplated adenine at the 3' end of mir- <dig> was found. mir- <dig> clone sequences were truncated by  <dig> nts from the 3' end .

identified novel mirnas
we identified one precursor mirna from est dataset  having sequence similarity with mammalian and bird mir- <dig>  we also found reads of a putative novel mir-147* sequence in the deep sequencing dataset .

antisense mirna of reverse complementarity to mir- <dig> with one mismatch and additional nucleotides at the 3' end was another putative novel mirna . the expression pattern of the antisense  throughout the development was different from that of the mir- <dig>  the ratio antisense:sense expression was the highest at the blastula stage, then declined as the development progressed. sense mirna expression was higher than antisense from the first feeding stage onwards .

characterization atlantic halibut small rnas
the three distinct peaks in the size distribution of atlantic halibut small rna consisted of  <dig> -  <dig> nts cluster corresponding to piwi-interacting rnas,  <dig> -  <dig> nts cluster containing mirnas and short interfering rnas, and 10- <dig> nts cluster of unknown origin and function . to our knowledge, these very short rnas have not been characterized yet; previously, they were considered as degradation products and removed from the datasets during the data processing  <cit> .

the number of reads in size range between  <dig> and  <dig> nts was high  indicating that the libraries were enriched with mirnas. mirnas are classified into different families based on their seed sequence similarity that span  <dig> -  <dig> nucleotide positions from 5' end of mature mirna  <cit> . this conservation allows comparison among species. in the present study, all but two known fish mirna families were identified, confirming high conservation of mirnas among teleosts.

expression profile of conserved mirnas and halibut development
atlantic halibut has morphologically defined developmental stages that can be inferred along with the expression of various genes  <cit> . the increase in mirna diversity along with the developmental advancement  indicates the importance of mirnas in the tissue and organ differentiation, similar to mice  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , other fish  <cit> , and invertebrates  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that mirnas play pivotal roles in the developmental progression and maintenance of tissue identity in several species  <cit> . in the present study, mirnas were expressed either uniquely or ubiquitously during the development .

maternal-zygotic transition  was the earliest developmental transition investigated in the present study. in mammals, the onset of mzt occurs during the three first cell divisions  <cit> , while in most teleosts it takes place around the beginning of gastrulation  <cit> . maternal transcripts clearance and mzt in zebrafish and medaka is associated with the expression of mir- <dig> family  <cit> . similarly, we demonstrated previously that maternal transcripts decline around mzt in atlantic halibut  <cit> . high expression of mir- <dig> at the onset of gastrulation  suggests that mzt in atlantic halibut is facilitated by mirnas.

we found that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  or mir- <dig> families were relatively highly expressed throughout somitogenesis and hatching . mir- <dig> family is involved in early development and functional cell differentiation in mammals  <cit> . high expressions of mir- <dig> family during halibut organogenesis can imply this assertion. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been identified along with hox genes cluster in fruit fly, zebrafish, pufferfish, mouse, and human  <cit> . mir- <dig> family, highly expressed around halibut hatching stage , have been implicated in regulation of angiogenesis  <cit> . thus, the mir- <dig> family could also promote development of the blood and lymphatic vascular systems in halibut.

some mirnas, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> family, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were expressed intensively during the first feeding stage . previous studies have shown exclusive expression of some mirnas in certain tissue types  <cit> . for example, in zebrafish, mir- <dig> is expressed in differentiated neurons, and mir- <dig> is broadly expressed in both proliferative and differentiated brain cells  <cit> . the expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in halibut was synchronized with the beginning of exogenous feeding, which requires intensified neural functions for active movement, identification, and capturing of a prey. also, mir- <dig> was expressed in similar fashion during the first feeding. mir- <dig> is involved in intestinal cell proliferation in mouse,  <cit> , and in zebrafish it is expressed in the gut  <cit> . high expression of mir- <dig> during the start of exogenous feeding in halibut might be related to intestinal growth.

various mirnas, including mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  are differentially expressed during metamorphosis of japanese flounder  <cit> . in the present study, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were among mirnas highly expressed during halibut metamorphosis . erythropoiesis is regulated by many mirnas including mir- <dig>  <cit> . specific expression of a number of mirnas during halibut metamorphosis indicates the possible involvement of mirnas in this developmental transition.

relatively high expression of mirna*'s have been reported during zebrafish development  <cit>  and in japanese flounder  <cit> . our results support these findings. in a number of cases halibut mirna* expression exceeded mirna expression and showed development-specific pattern . mirna*s can be part of the post-transcriptional regulatory network during the development  <cit> .

isomir expression during halibut development
size variants found in multiple mirnas during atlantic halibut development  raise the question whether they play any regulatory role. the presence of truncated or added template nucleotides in  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas in this study is similar to that reported in few other species  <cit> .

frequent 5' nucleotide addition observed in some of the mirnas  might be explained as imperfect cleavage of pri- and/or pre-mirnas by drosha and dicer micro processors. starega-roslan et al.  <cit>  have shown that the structure of hairpins including the symmetry of internal loops and number of nucleotides on bulges affects size heterogeneity of mature mirnas in human cell lines. other possible explanation is that mirna size variants can result from paralogue genes  <cit> , or different allelic forms.

a number of reads in the present study showed significant additions of a or u. the presence of non-template nucleotides at the 3' end in our datasets  may indicate post-maturation modifications of mirnas, as shown in mammals and insects  <cit> . mirna modifications including 3'-methylation and adenosine-to-inosine editing have been reported in several organisms  <cit> . these changes are implicated in the stability, protection and destruction of mirnas, as well as in determining mirnas efficiency in loading to argonaute protein complex  <cit> .

we found isomirs in both cloning and next generation sequencing datasets; for example, mir-17a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> had identical isomirs . similar results have been reported in different organisms and platforms  <cit> . all those data suggest that end modifications in mature mirna could unlikely be a processing error.

differential expression of isomirs has recently been reported during drosophila development  <cit> . also, it has been shown that both 5' and 3' truncated versions of mirnas were incorporated in rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> , indicating possible functional role of isomirs. we demonstrated that isomirs showed clearly distinctive expression patterns during the development of halibut . our data suggest possible diversification strategy for selective exclusion/inclusion of certain target genes from/for repressive control during the specific stages of development. therefore, we hypothesize that isomirs can be legitimate and biologically meaningful forms of mature mirnas, which deserve further investigation.

novel mirnas in atlantic halibut
discovery of species-specific mirnas largely depend upon the availability of genomic resources, since mapping and extracting precursor mirna sequences is a crucial step of the process. given the limitation of adequate genome resources for atlantic halibut, we identified only single precursor mirna from atlantic halibut est data using stringent criteria. although this precursor mirna was characterized in mammals and chicken  <cit> , the mirna* sequences have not been characterized yet  <cit> . the other novel mirna was antisense mirna . transcription of mirna iab- <dig> locus from both dna strands shows developmental importance of sense/antisense mirnas in flies as well as in mammals  <cit> . deep sequencing data revealed mirna sense/antisense expression during silkworm development  <cit> . the gradual shift between the antisense and sense mirna expression during the atlantic halibut development suggests that antisense mirnas can have a functional role.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> conserved mirnas, one mirna*, and one novel antisense mirna during atlantic halibut ontogenesis. we profiled their expression pattern using solid deep sequencing technology and verified it using rt-qpcr. we demonstrated differential expression of mirnas throughout major developmental transitions. some mirna*'s showed higher expression than their mirna counterparts. also, we found reciprocal expression levels of sense/antisense mirnas during halibut development. we demonstrated differential expression patterns in a number of isomirs. whether isomirs are biologically meaningful it will be addressed in the future investigations.
