BACKGROUND
virulent mycobacteria such as mycobacterium leprae and m. tuberculosis manipulate host cells to persist within them. apoptosis, or programmed cell death is essential for the homeostatic regulation of cells, restriction of intracellular pathogens and also for stimulation of the host adaptive immune response. virulent mycobacteria modulate host cell apoptosis to create a protected niche within cells  <cit> , and downregulate protective host cytokines such as, tnfα and ifnγ  <cit>  to reduce effector t cell and macrophage responses to the pathogen. virulent m. tuberculosis and m. bovis induce lower levels of apoptosis than avirulent strains  <cit> . virulent mycobacteria such as m. leprae induce reduced activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine such as tnfα, as compared with the non-pathogenic m. bovis bcg strain  <cit> . the apoptotic response to mycobacteria is found to be dependent on cytokine activation  <cit>  whereby, tnfα has been shown to activate mycobacterium-induced apoptosis <cit> , while il- <dig> downregulates apoptosis in macrophages  <cit> .

m. leprae causes a disease spectrum ranging from disseminated multibacillary  leprosy to restricted paucibacillary  disease. t cell and macrophage responses are less affected in pb leprosy than in mb, where effector t cell and macrophage responses are severely compromised. multibacillary leprosy granulomas show increased expression of fas ligand which may protect these sites from attack by fas-expression cytotoxic t lymphocytes  <cit> . production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnfα is found to be greater in pb disease as compared with mb disease  <cit> . although apoptotic proteins are activated in leprosy lesions from all patients  <cit> , reports indicate that apoptosis is greater in pb disease, correlating with increased tnfα secretion. a role for tnfα is further corroborated as m. leprae induced apoptosis is reduced by treatment with tnfα inhibitor pentoxyfylline  <cit>  or anti-tnfα antibodies  <cit> .

regulation of programmed cell death occurs via either the intrinsic pathway, involving mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase  <dig>  or the extrinsic pathway, involving the stimulation of death receptors expressed on the cell surface and activation of caspase  <dig>  the bcl 2-family of proteins comprise of anti-apoptotic members; bcl- <dig>  bcl-xl and mcl- <dig>  and pro-apoptotic members; bad, bid, bax and bak. pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins located in the cytosol act as sensors of cellular stress and damage  <cit> . upon activation, they relocate to the mitochondrial surface where anti-apoptotic proteins are located. activation of bax or bad and blockade of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins are pivotal steps in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. bad positively regulates cell apoptosis by forming heterodimers with bcl-xl and bcl- <dig> and reversing their death repressor activity. pro-apoptotic bak is sequestered by mcl- <dig> and bcl-xl; but not bcl- <dig> until displaced by bid, bad or bak  <cit> . when there is an excess of pro apoptotic proteins, cells are more sensitive to apoptosis.

mycobacteria interfere with host apoptosis by modifying expression of bcl- <dig> proteins. virulent m. tuberculosis has been shown to repress apoptosis by upregulation of bcl- <dig>  <cit>  and mcl- <dig>  <cit> , and by deactivation of bad  <cit>  and bax  <cit> . previously, m. leprae has been shown to induce apoptosis in monocytes via induction of bak and bax genes  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which m. leprae influences host cell apoptosis is as yet unclear.

the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line thp- <dig> has been established as a model to study mycobacterial growth and persistence  <cit>  in addition to mycobacterium-induced apoptosis  <cit> . here we have investigated the mechanism by which virulent m. leprae regulates apoptosis in thp- <dig> human monocytes as compared with the non-pathogenic m. bovis bcg vaccine strain.

RESULTS
mycobacterium leprae induces less cell death as compared with m. bovis bcg
m. leprae and bcg-induced death in thp- <dig> cells was evaluated by fluorescent viability staining. a time course of infection was carried out at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post-stimulation. viability was determined after infection with mycobacterium at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> and  <dig> in each case. neither m. leprae nor bcg induced any significant loss in cell viability at the earlier  <dig> h time interval studied . after  <dig> h of culture m. leprae did not cause any significant loss of viability in thp- <dig> cells at moi- <dig> however, cell death was evident in cells infected at moi- <dig>  at  <dig> h but not at either moi  <dig> or moi- <dig>  by the later  <dig> h time interval. in contrast, bcg infection of thp- <dig> cells resulted in a significant increase in cell death at both mois  <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> h   and this effect was also evident at  <dig> h  .

the pattern of genomic dna fragmentation in mycobacterium infected cells was determined in order to investigate the cause of loss in cell viability observed at  <dig> h post-infection. bcg-infection of cells resulted in dna laddering characteristic of apoptotic cells, with an increase in apoptosis with dose from moi- <dig> to moi- <dig> . in contrast, apoptotic laddering was not observed in cells infected with m. leprae .

we employed gamma-irradiated m. leprae in our assays as this was the only strain available to us and we have previously used it to model m. leprae infections in cells from both healthy controls and leprosy patients  <cit> . the m. bovis bcg strain served as a comparison of a non-pathogenic species, while heat-killed bcg was employed as a control for bcg viability in the assays. heat-killed bcg at the lower infection dose of moi- <dig> did not cause any significant loss in thp- <dig> viability but did so at moi- <dig>  at  <dig> h. however, cell death was not induced by heat-killed bcg at  <dig> h post-infection .

m. leprae is a poorer inducer of tnfα than m. bovis bcg
a role for tnfα is indicated in mycobacterium-induced apoptosis. m. leprae-induced apoptosis in primary macrophages has been shown to be dependent on tnfα activation  <cit> , while bcg-induced apoptosis in thp- <dig> cells is dependent on an endogenous tnf response  <cit> . virulent mycobacteria are poorer inducers of tnfα than avirulent strains  <cit> . m. leprae has previously been shown to induce only negligible tnfα secretion in thp- <dig> cells  <cit> . we investigated m. leprae induced tnfα secretion and mrna expression in thp- <dig> cells to determine whether the low level of apoptosis observed could be associated with a lack of tnfα activation in the assay. m. leprae and bcg -induced cytokine secretion was measured at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post-stimulation. bcg infection of cells induced tnfα secretion within  <dig> h of stimulation  with peak secretion at  <dig> h  and a decrease at  <dig> h . m. leprae did not induce any detectable tnfα secretion in thp- <dig> cells at either moi  <dig> or  <dig> at  <dig> h, with negligible secretion  at the  <dig> h peak interval. however, m. leprae induced tnfα mrna expression upon infection of cells but at a lower level than as compared with bcg .

bak and bad gene expression is down-regulated in m. leprae infected thp- <dig> cells
m. leprae infection of peripheral blood monocytes has been shown to result in the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein bad and induction of bak mrna  <cit> . in this study we did not observe apoptosis in thp- <dig> cells infected with m. leprae, while cells infected with bcg showed increased apoptosis. to investigate the mechanism responsible for this difference we measured mycobacterium-induced mrna expression of pro-apoptotic  and anti-apoptotic  genes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection. gene expression was compared relative to that of the β-actin housekeeping gene in each case. fig.  <dig> illustrates the changes in gene expression observed in response to m. leprae and bcg infection of cells at mois of  <dig> and  <dig>  m. leprae induced negligible effect on bcl- <dig> mrna at both infection doses, while bad mrna expression appeared to be reduced at moi- <dig> but increased at moi- <dig> . m. leprae downregulated bak expression at both infection doses studied. in contrast, bcg infection of monocytes downregulated bcl- <dig> mrna but upregulated bad mrna expression at both mois  <dig> and  <dig>  while it had negligible effect on bak mrna expression . the data shown is of one representative experiment and some variation is evident between background levels of mrna expression in different experiments. to account for this, in each case mrna levels for each gene were normalized to baseline levels of β-actin within the same experiment. further time course kinetics of apoptotic mrna expression based on data from  <dig> independent experiments is presented in fig.  <dig>  the effect of heat-killed bcg on thp- <dig> cells is also included. negligible change was observed in bad or bak gene expression in response to m. leprae or bcg  at the earlier  <dig> and  <dig> h time intervals. however by  <dig> h, m. leprae induced downregulation of mrna expression both pro-apoptotic genes bad  and bak  . in contrast, live bcg induced negligible change in either bad or bak mrna expression at  <dig> h post-infection . killed bcg induced downregulation of bad mrna  but upregulation of bak mrna  at  <dig> h post-infection .

outcome of cellular viability/apoptosis is determined not only by the expression of specific pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, but is dependent on the ratio between pro and anti apoptotic genes. therefore, to further understand mycobacterium-induced change in host apoptotic gene expression we determined bad/bcl- <dig> and bak/bcl- <dig> expression ratios. we chose to evaluate gene expression at  <dig> h post-infection, the time interval at which differential cell death induction is evident between m. leprae and bcg . m. leprae infection of thp- <dig> cells resulted in a  <dig> % decrease in bad/bcl- <dig> and a  <dig> % reduction in bak/bcl- <dig> gene expression as compared with unstimulated cells  while m. leprae at moi  <dig> caused a  <dig> % decrease in bad/bcl- <dig> and  <dig> % decrease in bak/bcl- <dig> mrna expression . bcg infection of cells at moi- <dig> increased bad/bcl- <dig> by  <dig> % and reduced bak/bcl- <dig> mrna expression by  <dig> %, with a further increase in bad/bcl- <dig> mrna at moi- <dig> and similar change in bak/bcl- <dig> mrna. killed bcg had a limited effect on bad/bcl- <dig>  and bak/bcl- <dig>  mrna expression at mois  <dig> and  <dig> .

m. leprae upregulates mcl- <dig> mrna expression
survival of m. tuberculosis infection in thp- <dig> cells has been linked to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family member mcl- <dig>  <cit> . however, a role for mcl- <dig> in m. leprae or bcg infection of cells is not known. therefore, we investigated m. leprae and bcg induced mcl- <dig> gene expression in thp- <dig> cells. a time course of mycobacterium-induced mcl- <dig> expression was determined at  <dig>   <dig> and 48h. mcl- <dig> was evaluated relative to that of the housekeeping gene human ribosomal protein , which has been shown to be optimal for real-time pcr quantification of gene expression in human cells  <cit> . at the earlier  <dig> h time point neither m. leprae nor bcg infection of thp- <dig> cells had any effect on mcl- <dig> mrna expression as compared with unstimulated cells . m. leprae induced an increase in mcl- <dig> expression by  <dig>  % at  <dig> h post-infection with a further  increase at  <dig> h. in contrast, bcg induced a decrease in mcl- <dig> mrna by  <dig> % at  <dig> h and  <dig> % by  <dig> h .

discussion
our study shows that m. leprae inhibits apoptosis in the thp- <dig> monocytic cell line by downregulation of proapoptotic genes bak and bad and concomitant upregulation of anti-apoptotic mcl- <dig> mrna. in contrast, the increased apoptosis evidenced by bcg infection of thp- <dig> cells is coordinated by an increase in bad mrna expression relative to bcl- <dig> and a downregulation of mcl- <dig> mrna.

our data correlates with previous reports that virulent mycobacteria induce lower levels of cell death than avirulent mycobacteria  <cit> . we did not observe m. leprae-induced loss in cell viability in cells infected at moi- <dig> at  <dig> post-infection. while, some thp- <dig> cell death was caused by m. leprae at moi  <dig> by  <dig> h post-infection, this was not accompanied by the characteristic dna laddering pattern found in apoptotic cells. therefore, it is possible that the loss of viability observed here could be due to an alternate mechanism of cell death such as, necrosis, and could also be attributed to the increased mycobacterial load in the thp- <dig> cells. however, at the later time interval of  <dig> h m. leprae -induced cell death was not observed at either infection dose. this may be attributed to the time required for m. leprae -induced modification of host gene expression which facilitates persistence of the pathogen within cells. this is further evidenced by the time course changes in mrna expression of the bcl- <dig> family of proteins observed in this study.

cell death induced by bcg was dose dependent as shown previously  <cit> . bcg-induced apoptosis  increased with time from  <dig> to  <dig> h post-infection. loss in cell viability was observed in response to heat-killed bcg at  <dig> h but was no longer apparent by  <dig> h. the earlier response to non-viable bcg observed at  <dig> h may be the result of non-specific binding and entry of the mycobacterium into the host cell which may trigger host defenses. initial cell attachment and uptake of bcg into host macrophages has shown to be common amongst live and dead mycobacterium, with subsequent differences occurring later due to differential trafficking of live and dead organisms within host the endosomal/lysosomal pathway  <cit> . as bcg-induced apoptosis is most probably dependent on bacterial viability it is therefore only sustained in the case of live bcg.

m. leprae-induced less tnfα secretion and gene expression than bcg did. a role for tnfα has been defined previously in bcg-induced apoptosis in thp- <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, m. leprae-induced apoptosis in primary monocytes has been shown to be tnfα dependent  <cit> , and inhibition of tnfα via treatment with anti-tnfα inhibitors or pentoxyfylline is found to reduce host inflammation and cell death in reactional leprosy  <cit> . therefore, in the case of m. leprae infection, the reduced levels of tnfα activation coordinate with the downregulation of pro-apoptotic gene expression would contribute to apoptosis inhibition in the cells.

we found m. leprae to downregulate expression of pro-apoptotic genes bak and bad relative to both β-actin and anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig>  this correlates with previous studies where reduced bax and increased bcl- <dig> mrna expression has been shown to be responsible for slowly progressive murine tuberculosis  <cit> . the role of bad gene expression in determining outcome of cellular viability is further indicated where cell wall lipoarabinomannan  from m. tuberculosis-induces survival in monocytes by phosphorylation of the protein bad, hence preventing it from binding bcl- <dig>  <cit> . however, our work differs from that by hernandez, et al. who demonstrate that infection of primary monocytes with irradiated m. leprae resulted in apoptosis due to activation of apoptotic genes, bax and bak  <cit> . this apparent discrepancy can be attributed to differential outcome of mycobacterial infection dependent on host cell type, as evidenced by the variation in apoptosis induction by m. tuberculosis observed in alveolar epithelial cells and u <dig> macrophages  <cit> . in addition, hernandez et al  <cit>  showed that m. leprae increases apoptosis in monocytes-derived macrophages of leprosy patients. however, macrophages from leprosy patients are more prone to apoptotic death than those from healthy individuals  <cit> . therefore, the spontaneous activation of apoptotic genes in leprosy patients may make the cells more prone to extracellular triggers such as infection with mycobacteria.

we demonstrate a role for mcl- <dig> in m. leprae mediated inhibition of apoptosis in the thp- <dig> cells. the anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family member gene mcl- <dig> has been shown to play a role in cell survival of human polymorphonuclear cells  <cit>  and neutrophils  <cit> . virulent m. tuberculosis h37rv has been shown to persist in thp- <dig> cells by upregulation of the anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family member gene mcl- <dig>  <cit> . pro-apoptotic bak is sequestered by mcl- <dig>  <cit>  therefore upregulation of mcl- <dig> expression would result in a coordinate decrease in available bak leading to further downregulation of apoptosis.

we found bcg-induced apoptosis to be accompanied with increased expression of bad/bcl- <dig> mrna. previously, bcg-induced apoptosis has been shown to be a consequence of downregulated bcl- <dig> expression  <cit>  and also by activation of caspases  <cit> . we show for the first time in our study that bcg induces downregulation of anti-apoptotic mcl- <dig> mrna. overall, our results indicate that the differential effect of virulent m. leprae and non-pathogenic bcg on host cellular survival is determined by the combined gene expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes bad, bak, bcl- <dig> and mcl- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
m. leprae-induced downregulation of bad and bak genes coordinate with a reduced tnfα response and upregulation of mcl- <dig> results in the inhibition of apoptosis in thp- <dig> monocytes. therefore, leading to a more efficient mechanism for dissemination of leprosy infection.
