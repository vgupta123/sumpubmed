BACKGROUND
aging is accompanied by a process of cellular senescence that occurs throughout the body, resulting in a decrease in the regenerative potential of the stem cell pools  <cit> . in the brain there are two stem cell pools, one residing in the subventricular zone , and the other in the subgranular zone  of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. as in other stem cell pools such as the hemapoietic pool in the bone marrow or the satellite stem cells in the muscle, the stem cells in the brain lose there capacity to generate new cells with age  <cit> . in the brain it appears that the decrease in neurogenesis is a result of a decrease in proliferation of the stem cells and not due to a loss of the cells  <cit> . in the muscle it has been shown that the stem cells can be rejuvenated by exposure of the cells to the systemic environment of a young animal through parabiosis  <cit> . even though it has been known since the 1960s that a cellular senescence occurs with age  <cit> , it is less clear if this cellular senescence leads to an aging phenotype, particularly to the age related cognitive decline.

however, it is clear that the process of cellular senescence that occurs with age is an important mechanism to protect against cancer. there are a number of tumor-supressor genes, including p <dig> and p16ink4a, which respond to cellular stressors to induce senescence  <cit> . it has recently been shown that knocking out p16ink4a can restore the proliferative potential of the aged neural stem cells  <cit> , but the animals have decreased longevity due to tumor formation  <cit> . this demonstrates the important balance that oncogenes play in protecting organisms from cancer, but with the negative consequence of inducing an aging state of cellular senescence. an effective target to lessen the amount of senescence might be the cellular stressors that accumulate with age which include telomere shorting  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit> , inflammation  <cit> , increased corticosteroid levels  <cit> , and a decrease in a number of trophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor , insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>   <cit> .

a potent cellular stressor that is increased with age is inflammation. recently, our laboratory has shown that reducing neuroinflammation in aged rats by blocking the conversion of pro-il-1β to il-1β through inhibition of the converting enzyme caspase- <dig> rescued some of the age-related decrease in neurogenesis  <cit>  and resulted in an improvement in cognitive function  <cit> . we believed that human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells  may have a similar potential to restore some of the loss in capacity of the neural stem/progenitor cells ability to proliferate and differentiate into neurons.

in an animal model of stroke, ucbmc administered intravenously have reduced infarct volume and improved functional recovery on behavioral measures  <cit> . the effects of ucbmc have been attributed to changes in the microenvironment of the brain, through the release of trophic factors or by reducing inflammation, and not by a direct replacement of cells  <cit> . ucbmc contains a number of cell types including b-cells and t-cells, as well as, mesenchymal and endothelial progenitor cells. ucbmc is also a rich source of cd34+ hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . it was recently demonstrated that a systemic injection of ucbmc cells could suppress inflammation in the brain following stroke. moreover, the effects of ucbmc cells seemed to shift the cytokine expression from a th <dig> response to a th <dig> response  <cit> . in addition to the immune modulatory effects, ucbmc cells also produce a number of trophic factors including, but not limited to, vegf, nerve growth factor, and cytokine colony stimulating factor- <dig>  thrombopoietin, and il <dig>  <cit> .

the goal of the present study was to determine if ucbmc could stimulate the endogenous stem/progenitor cells to regenerate new cells. to this end, young and aged rats were intravenously administered a single dose of ucbmc to determine if ucbmc could increase proliferation of the neural stem/progenitor cells as well as to determine if there would be an effect on neurogenesis in the aged rats. this study provides insight into how the aged stem cell niche could be rejuvenated. furthermore, as the ucbmc are administered minimally invasively this study raises the possibility of a clinically applicable therapeutic for the aged brain.

RESULTS
human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells  stimulate proliferation of the senescent hippocampal neural stem cell
in the first of a series of experiments we wanted to determine if ucbmc given intravenously could stimulate the proliferation of the endogenous stem/progenitor cells in the hippocampus. we chose to study proliferation as a slowing of the cell cycle and a decrease in proliferation seems to be most affected with age when compared to the ability of the cells to survive and differentiate into neurons which appears to occur at relatively the same rate in young animals  <cit> . the effect of a single intravenous injection of ucbmc on cell proliferation in the granule cell layer in young  or aged  f <dig> rats was determined by analyzing brdu staining  <dig> hours after the brdu injections . using the optical fractionator method of design based stereology  <cit> , we found that in the aged animals there was a significant increase  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) in the number of brdu+ cells in the ucbmc group  compared to the animals that received media alone  . in young animals there was no significant effect of the ucbmc treatment . to determine if there might be a prolonged effect on proliferation in the aged f <dig> rats brdu injections were given  <dig> days after the ucbmc treatment. figure  shows the effect of a single intravenous injection of ucbmc on the number of cells that incorporated brdu on day  <dig>  stereological analysis revealed that in the aged ucbmc-treated rats there was a significant increase in the number of brdu+ cells  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> )  compared to the media-treated group .

neurogenesis is stimulated in the aged hippocampus following ucbmc treatment
to determine if ucbmc would also stimulate neurogenesis in the aged rats, doublecortin  immunostaining was examined. counting the number of dcx+ cells in the sgz/gcl, we found a significant increase  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) in the number of dcx+ cells in the aged rats  <dig> days after a single i.v. injection of the ucbmc  compared to animals that received media alone  . to confirm the results obtained by dcx, and to determine if there was any change in the ability of the proliferating cells to differentiate following a ucbmc treatment, we injected the animals with brdu  for five days beginning  <dig> hours after our i.v. treatment. quantifying the number of brdu+ cells in the sgz/gcl using the optical fractionator method of design based stereology we found a similar increase in the number of brdu+ cells in the aged ucbmc treated group as was found using the neurogenic marker dcx . in aged rats, there was a significant increase  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) in the number of brdu+ cells generated over a period of five days following a single i.v. injection of ucbmc  compared to the rats that received media alone ; as determined by the tukey's multiple comparison test . in this experiment, we also included a group that was injected with adult human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  as a control for the effect of delivering cells. the pbmc group was determined to have significantly fewer brdu+ cells  than the ucbmc treated group , but this was not significantly different from the group that received media alone . as with the results of the proliferation study, young rats showed no significant effect of ucbmc treatment . to determine if the treatment with ucbmc might alter the phenotype of the newborn cells, we double labeled with the antibodies to tuj <dig>  neun and gfap. while exhaustive sampling was not conducted,  <dig> brdu+ cells were analyzed from each rat  using confocal microscopy for each marker and there did not appear to be any change in phenotype due to the treatment . to confirm that the increase in neurogenesis was from the endogenous stem/progenitor cells, sections were stained for hunu to look for the presence of the transplanted cells in the brain. cells positive for the hunu were found in the blood smears of the rats that were treated with ucbmc, but no hunu immunoreactive cells were found in the hippocampus of the rats .

a decrease in microglia activation following ucbmc correlates with the increase in neurogenesis
using the optical fractionator method of design based stereology, we counted the number of ox-6+ cells in the dentate gyrus  <dig> days after a single ucbmc injection; this was at the same time point that we observed an increase in dcx+ cells and brdu+ cells. ox- <dig> is a marker for mhcii and presumably stains for microglia in an activated, proinflammatory state. in aged rats, we found that  <dig> days after the ucbmc treatment there was a significant decrease  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) in the total number of activated ox-6+ microglia in the ucbmc group  compared to the media control  . the decrease in ox-6+ microglia negatively correlated with the number of dcx+ cells  = --  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) .

morphologically the ox-6+ cells expressed two main phenotypes . type  <dig> microglia appear to be in a more quiescent state based on morphology type  <dig> microglia were thought to represent a more activated state. the type  <dig> microglia make up the majority of the ox-6+ cells in the dentate gyrus and were found to be significantly decreased  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) in aged rats following ucbmc treatment  compared to controls  . the type  <dig> microglia, while representing a smaller percentage of the total ox-6+ microglia, were significantly reduced  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ) to a greater extent by the ucbmc treatment  compared to controls  than the total microglia . fifteen days after the ucbmc treatment, there was a  <dig> fold change in the number of type  <dig> ox-6+ microglia, whereas there was only a  <dig>  fold change in the total number of ox-6+ microglia. it appears that the highly activated microglia are being reduced to a greater extent by the ucbmc treatment, although all ox-6+ microglia are affected.

discussion
the present study explored whether human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells  could improve the neurogenic niche of the aged brain and stimulate the endogenous stem/progenitor cells to generate new neurons. as determined by stereological analysis of both dcx and brdu, a single peripherally administered injection of ucbmc appeared to stimulate neurogenesis. the finding that the administration of ucbmc also increased the number of proliferative cells generated within  <dig> hours following the treatment, suggests that the increase in neurogenesis observed in this study may be a consequence of an increase in proliferation rather than changes in differentiation or survival of newly generated cells. to support this hypothesis, it will be important to allow more time for the cells to fully mature and then determine if there is still no change in the phenotype of the brdu+ cells. it will also be important to determine what effect ucbmc have on the survival of the brdu+ cells.

in addition, it was determined that ucbmc were able to increase cell proliferation for at least fifteen days in the aged rats. this suggests that the ucbmc may have a beneficial effect on the microenvironment of the aged brain. in support of this hypothesis we show that coinciding with an increase in neurogenesis in the aged treated rats, there was a decrease in the number of activated microglia in the dentate gyrus. a negative correlation between the degree of inflammation as indicated by the activation of microglia and the number of newborn neurons has been previously described  <cit> . consistent with previous studies showing that ucbmc have the potential to reduce neuroinflammation  <cit>  in the aged brain, we did find that neurogenesis correlated with the number of activated microglia, suggesting that ucbmc were stimulating neurogenesis by decreasing microglia activation. although other possibilities cannot be excluded, since ucbmc could be having multiple effects including increasing trophic support as previously published  <cit> .

ucbmc have been shown to reduce neuroinflammation  <cit>  and, consistent with previous studies, we show here that the peripherally administered ucbmc do have anti-inflammatory properties. it appears that one of the factors that leads to the negative regulation of neural stem cells is inflammation  <cit> . a primary source of inflammation in the cns is from the macrophages/microglia which can produce a wide array of cytotoxic factors, including proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor , il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . with age, microglia shift from a quiescent state into an active proinflammatory state. it is not clear if this change in activation state is in response to injury, infection, or debris or if it is due to dysregulated cytokine levels. another possibility recently proposed, is that microglia becoming senescent and this leads to them becoming dysfunctional  <cit> . it has previously been demonstrated in models of induced inflammation through the use of lps or radiation, a dramatic decrease in proliferation and neurogenesis occur, and when the inflammation is alleviated the replicative potential of the stem cells returns  <cit> . this effect is likely a protective mechanism so that the dna is not exposed to the noxious inflammatory environment which could damage the replicating dna. this correlation also imparts support to the hypothesis that ucbmc stimulate neurogenesis by decreasing inflammation, particularly the activation state of microglia. however, it does not rule out the possibility that ucbmc may be acting on multiple targets, with microglia only representing one part of the total mechanism.

while ucbmc do seem to have an effect on microglia, it is not clear how this occurs. a number of studies have shown that t-cells appear to act on macrophages/microglia to cause them to adopt a phenotype that is 'pro-repair' , without being pro-inflammatory  and this effect can promote neurogenesis and be neuroprotective  <cit> . as t-cells are a major fraction of ucbmc, it is possible that the naïve t-cells in the ucbmc are able to induce a protective t-cell mediated response in the aged rats, since adult pbmc did not have an effect. alternatively, the cd34+ stem cells in the ucbmc may be involved. taguchi et al.  <cit>  has shown that cd34+ stem cells can increase both angiogenesis and neurogenesis as part of the protective mechanism against stroke. from the results of the current study it can not be determined if the effects of the ucbmc are a result of direct action on the brain or though peripheral effect. however, the fact that we did not detect any immunoreactivity for human nuclei in the brains of the ucbmc-treated rats raises the possibility that the ucbmc may be acting through a peripheral mechanism. moreover, the observation that the adult pbmc did not alter hippocampal neurogenesis ruled out the possibility of a non-specific effect due to an influx of cells, supporting our belief that the increase in neurogenesis, which occurred following treatment with ucbmc was not due to an influx of cells but was specific to ucbmc.

the present study did not attempt to determine if decreasing senescence of the neural stem cells could reverse the cognitive decline with age. there is still much debate surrounding the role of neurogenesis in learning and memory  <cit>  and whether cellular senescence of the stem cell pool with age leads to an aging phenotype. while not a goal of the current study, it will be important to determine if the rejuvenation of the aged stem/progenitor cell pool can reverse the age-related cognitive decline.

in summary, this study demonstrates that a single peripheral injection of ucbmc could stimulate the endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells to increase proliferation. we also determined that the ucbmc were able to improve the microenvironment of the aged brain by reducing the number of activated microglia, and this reduction is correlated with an increase in neurogenesis. further work will be important to determine the mechanism of action of ucbmc in the aged rats, including the possible role of the immune system in a t-cell mediated response, as well as the affects of angiogenesis via the cd34+ stem cells. it will also be important in future experiments to determine the duration that a single injection of ucbmc will elevated proliferation in aged rats. not only do the results of this study provide novel insight into the state of the aged stem cell niche, the ability of the ucbmc to exert their effects while being administered minimally invasively may make translation to the clinical setting more likely. for this reason it will be important in future studies to determine the most efficacious dose and dosing regimen. nevertheless, this is the first time that a systemic injection of hematopoietic cells has been shown to restore the regenerative potential of the aged brain, providing a novel insight into how the regenerative potential of the aged stem cell niches could be restored.

CONCLUSIONS
the results demonstrate that a single intravenous injection of ucbmc in aged rats can significantly improve the microenvironment of the aged hippocampus and rejuvenate the aged neural stem/progenitor cells. our results raise the possibility of a peripherally administered cell therapy as an effective approach to improve the microenvironment of the aged brain.
