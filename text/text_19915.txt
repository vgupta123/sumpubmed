BACKGROUND
many tumors demonstrate a characteristic, non-random deletion of chromosomal material, termed loss of heterozygosity . from molecular genetics studies, deleted in liver cancer- <dig>   <cit>  and a closely related gene, dlc <dig>  <cit>  were discovered at two distinct chromosomal loci known to be sensitive to loh. the dlc <dig> and dlc <dig> proteins share  <dig> % amino acid identity. several studies suggest that dlc <dig> and dlc <dig> are tumor suppressors involved in the progression of a wide range of cancers  <cit> . for example, reintroduction of dlc <dig> suppresses proliferation of breast carcinoma  <cit>  and hepatoma cells  <cit>  and prevents the formation of tumors in nude mice. expression of dlc <dig> prevents the formation of ras induced foci in nih3t <dig> cells  <cit> . from examinations of several cancers, point mutations leading to the inactivation of dlc <dig> are rare. rather, dlc <dig> appears to be downregulated by promoter methylation  <cit> .

at  <dig> residues, murine dlc <dig> is a large protein with relatively few identifiable domains. based upon sequence homology and a recent deletion study  <cit> , the amino terminus of dlc <dig> contains a sterile alpha motif  domain  <cit> . following an expanse of unknown function, a gtpase activating domain  capable of inactivating rho and cdc <dig> is situated near the carboxyl terminus  <cit> . a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein -related lipid transfer  domain completes the protein and localizes dlc <dig> to mitochondria that are proximal to lipid droplets  <cit> . all of these domains are likely to be regulated by an array of intra- and intermolecular protein partnerships. the sam domain, which has a rich history as a protein-ligand binding motif  <cit> , represents an excellent focal point for exploring dlc <dig> partnerships in detail.

towards determining its functional role, we present the structure of the murine dlc2-sam domain solved using nuclear magnetic resonance  methods. consistent with secondary structure predictions, the dlc2-sam domain lacks what would be the third helix of a canonical, five helix sam domain. furthermore, the first two helices occur in a unique orientation. combined, these differences result in a structure that resembles an anti-parallel four-helix bundle as much as it resembles a sam domain. upon closer inspection of the structure, a hydrophobic cleft lined with aromatic residues may offer a binding site for a unique class of ligands.

RESULTS
by sequence similarity, the murine dlc2-sam domain is located near the n-terminus of the protein with boundaries conspicuously defined by exons 2– <dig> . the first exon has no obvious similarity to any short protein domains . using sequence similarity and exon boundaries as a guide, we expressed four hexahistidine-tagged protein fragments spanning the dlc2-sam domain. highly purified preparations of the largest fragment, dlc <dig> , were aggregated at μm concentrations precluding further analysis. fortunately, the remaining three dlc <dig> protein fragments were suitable for biophysical characterization.

far uv cd spectra indicate that dlc <dig> , dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig>  were all folded with a majority of α-helical content as shown by two characteristic minima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm . in exon  <dig> , the phd secondary structure algorithm  <cit>  predicts the presence of one α-helix spanning residues 22– <dig> immediately preceding the start of the sam domain. assuming an α-helix is present in exon  <dig>  the predicted mean residue ellipticities  at  <dig> nm for dlc <dig> , dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig> , are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> deg·cm2·dmol- <dig>  respectively. alternatively, if no α-helix is present in exon  <dig> of dlc <dig> , the predicted ellipticity decreases to  <dig>  together, the three spectra presented in figure 1a appear to underestimate the predicted mres by ~10%, which may be due in part to a systematic error in the estimation of protein concentration. regardless, at a qualitative level, the similarity in the absolute mres between dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig>  suggest that an α-helix may be present in exon  <dig> 

the shortest fragment, dlc <dig>  demonstrated a thermal denaturation midpoint  that was approximately 5°c lower than dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig>  suggesting that residues beyond arg <dig> contribute stabilizing contacts. since dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig>  demonstrated similar melting points, it suggests that the n-terminal sequence immediately flanking the dlc2-sam domain does not provide any additional stabilizing contacts.

following the cd study, the three dlc2-sam protein fragments were 15n-labeled for nmr analysis. amide hsqc spectra of dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig>  were nearly identical both in terms of the number of amide resonances and their absolute chemical shifts . the similarity between the two spectra suggests that residues 22– <dig> occur in intermediate exchange and therefore do not interact with the sam domain. a comparison of the dlc <dig>  and dlc <dig>  hsqc spectra revealed several sharp resonances that were not present in dlc <dig> . in the absence of chemical shift assignments, these sharp resonances would be attributed to a disordered stretch extending from the c-terminal end of the sam domain. taken together, these cd spectra and nmr hsqc spectra indicate that the minimal protein fragment of dlc <dig> encompassing the sam domain is consistent with the boundaries  predicted by exons and sequence similarity.

while the spectra of dlc <dig>  were qualitatively easier to interpret due to the absence of sharp resonances and the reduced 1h chemical shift degeneracy, this protein fragment could only be concentrated to  <dig>  mm thereby precluding any structural studies. furthermore, preparations of dlc <dig>  precipitated when mixed with pf <dig> bacteriophage for nmr orientational studies. in contrast, preparations of dlc <dig>  were stable up to a concentration of  <dig> mm and could be mixed with pf <dig> bacteriophage. based upon greater solubility and thermal stability, dlc <dig>  was selected for structural studies.

the nmr structure of the murine dlc2-sam domain  was solved using a combination of experimentally derived noe distance restraints, amide residual dipolar couplings, and dihedral angles derived from chemical shifts . the nmr structure of dlc <dig>  indicates that the last ordered residue is ala <dig>  in contrast, the cd study suggested there were additional stabilizing determinants beyond arg <dig>  however, we did not observe any contributions to the hydrophobic core from the nearby hydrophobes leu <dig>  val <dig>  or phe <dig>  the ensemble of lowest energy structures spanning residues 58– <dig> has a global backbone atom precision of  <dig>  Å. restricted to the regular secondary structure, the backbone atom precision is  <dig>  Å .

previously, we solved the nmr structure of the s. cerevisiae ste50-sam domain  <cit> . based upon sequence similarity, number of helices and the position of the helices, the ste50-sam domain demonstrates a typical fold and therefore, is a good basis for comparison with the dlc2-sam domain structure. as well, ste <dig>  like other sam domains including drosophila ph, scm, yan and mae  <cit>  presents two complementary surfaces for high-affinity sam-sam interactions. overall, the sam domains of dlc <dig> and ste <dig>  superimposed with a cα root-mean-square deviation  of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> residues . as illustrated in figure 2b, the dlc2-sam domain differs from a canonical, five-helix sam domain fold of ste <dig> in two distinct ways.

the first immediate distinction between the dlc <dig> and ste50-sam domains is demonstrated by the difference in the number of helices present. helix h <dig>  which is typically short, is replaced in the dlc2-sam domain by an extended structure occupying the same location. to facilitate the comparison with ste <dig>  we will refer to the dlc2-sam domain as a four-helix fold comprised of helices h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  in the ste50-sam domain, leu <dig> and ile  <dig> anchor helix h <dig> and contribute to the compact, hydrophobic core. as shown in figure 2b, two regularly spaced, conserved hydrophobic residues also anchor helix h <dig> of the s. cerevisiae ste11-sam domain  <cit>  and the drosophila polyhomeotic  and sex-comb-on-midleg  sam domains  <cit> . in lieu of helix h <dig>  ile <dig> and ile <dig> supply the requisite hydrophobic contacts from nearby positions in the dlc2-sam domain .

the relative orientation of a hairpin defined by helices h <dig> and h <dig> represents a second major distinction between the ste <dig> and dlc2-sam domains. in a typical sam domain, the hairpin is approximately perpendicular to helix h <dig>  in contrast, the helical hairpin of dlc2-sam occurs in an anti-parallel orientation to helix h <dig>  key unambiguous experimental noe observations defining this orientation are derived from tyr <dig> in helix h <dig>  and leu <dig> in helix h <dig> . both of these residues are distinguished by their upfield chemical shifts. interestingly, the side chain of trp <dig>  a bulky residue conserved throughout all sam domains in helix h <dig>  is similarly positioned near helix h <dig> in both dlc2-sam and ste50-sam domain structures. thus, trp <dig> may be considered a pivot point through which the helical hairpin has been rotated.

pairwise comparisons between the dlc2-sam domain and the entire pdb were performed using the ssm  server at the european bioinformatics institute  <cit> . the ssm method assigns a quality score to each match that is a function of overall protein length, the number of aligned residues between the two proteins, the number of gaps introduced and the cα rmsd. from this survey, no sam domains were identified among the top  <dig> hits presumably due to the alternate placement of the helices h1/h <dig> and the absence of helix h <dig>  the top hit with a rmsd of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> aligned residues was felix , a theoretical model of an anti-parallel, or up-down-up-down, four-helix bundle  <cit> . a superimposition of felix and dlc2-sam demonstrating the structural similarity is shown in figures 3a and 3b. although only six residues are identical between felix and dlc2-sam, the amphipathic character of the four helices is retained and consequently, the positions of nonpolar residues that contribute to the hydrophobic core of the respective proteins . on the basis of rmsd  and most aligned residues , the best experimentally determined structure that was similar to the dlc2-sam domain is also a four-helix bundle termed s- <dig>   <cit> .

interhelical angles present a straightforward means of comparing the dlc2-sam domain with representatives of four-helix bundle and five-helix sam domain classes. as shown in table  <dig>  the dlc2-sam domain presents its four helices in a nearly parallel manner, although there is variation in the direction at which the helices cross as compared to the felix model and the s- <dig> protein structure. there appears to be no similarity between the interhelical angles of dlc2-sam and nine five-helix sam domains presented. however, within the five-helix sam domain class itself, there is considerable similarity, the only exception being the angle at which helices h <dig> and h <dig> cross each other.

a dynamics study was performed to supplement the dlc2-sam domain structure determination. amide 15n t <dig> and t <dig> relaxation times and heteronuclear noe enhancements were measured at 23°c. in general terms, t <dig> relaxation rates and heteronuclear noe enhancements tend to be sensitive to fast motions at the ns timescale. on the other hand, t <dig> relaxation rates are sensitive to slower processes. a global molecular tumbling time, or correlation time, can be determined from the ensemble of t <dig> and t <dig> rates. as larger molecules tumble slower, the correlation time provides insight into the oligomeric state of a given protein. from gel filtration studies performed at μm concentrations, the dlc2-sam domain elutes as a single peak with a retention time that is consistent with a monomeric protein .

at  <dig>  mm, the concentration used for the nmr structural study, the average t1/t <dig> ratio was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  reflecting a correlation time  of  <dig>  ns. when the sample was diluted in half to  <dig>  mm and then in half again to  <dig>  mm, the t1/t <dig> ratios dropped slightly to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with respective correlation times of  <dig>  ns and  <dig>  ns. at a similar protein concentration and ionic strength, the s. cerevisiae ste <dig> kinase sam domain demonstrates a comparable correlation time of  <dig>  ns  <cit> . the observed reduction in correlation times suggests that the dlc2-sam domain has a slight concentration dependent propensity to self-associate. supporting this conclusion, dlc2-sam domain preparations for nmr spectroscopy were observed to polymerize into a gel over a period of months, even at 4°c and in the presence of reducing agents to prevent oxidization of the three solvent exposed cysteines. weak self-association has been documented previously for the ste <dig>  <cit>  and human ephrin kinase b <dig> sam domains  <cit> . however, unlike these two sam domains, no concentration dependent chemical shift changes were observed suggesting that dlc2-sam self-association is much weaker. at low concentrations , the minimal dlc2-sam protein fragment  had sufficient solubility for a relaxation study to be performed. from a similar t <dig> and t <dig> relaxation rate analysis, the loss of  <dig> c-terminal residues reduced the global correlation time from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ns.

on a per residue basis, the helix h4-h <dig> loop demonstrated higher t <dig> and t <dig> relaxation times and lower heteronuclear noe values  indicating the contribution of additional motions in the μs-ms range. consistent with the greater relative conformational sampling occurring in this region, fewer noe observations were made thereby leading to a higher backbone rmsd in the ensemble.

an examination of the dlc2-sam domain surface reveals a narrow hydrophobic cleft that extends from the helix h2-h <dig> loop towards helix h <dig> . this surface follows a tract of aromatic residues that include phe <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  phe <dig> and phe <dig>  of these aromatics, phe <dig> and phe <dig> are partially exposed and phe <dig> is entirely solvent exposed thereby providing a shallow pocket for a hydrophobic ligand. the position of this potential ligand binding cleft has not been observed in protein-protein  <cit>  and protein-nucleic acid complexes  <cit>  of other sam domains.

discussion
convergence and divergence of signals through ras and rho represent some of the most studied cases in the literature  <cit> . by targeting rho, cdc <dig>  and possibly other gtpases, the gap activity of dlc <dig> exerts a repressive effect on cell proliferation and regulates the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions  <cit> . combined, these abilities have earned dlc <dig> the designation as a tumor suppressor. since rhogap signaling proteins such as dlc <dig> outnumber their potential gtpase targets by over a factor of 2: <dig>  a considerable level of crosstalk is expected  <cit> . while the gap domain of dlc <dig> possesses all of the necessary determinants to interact with rho, additional sequences are likely necessary to couple dlc <dig> to multiprotein signaling complexes. a yeast two-hybrid study using full length dlc <dig> as bait identified a number of interacting proteins that shared no singular functional class  <cit> . the sam domain of dlc <dig>  owing to its established role in protein-protein interactions, is an obvious choice for beginning a refined study of dlc <dig> partners.

as previously demonstrated by the homo-oligomeric forms of the ste <dig>  <cit> , tel  <cit> , ephrin a <dig>  <cit>  and ephrin b <dig>  <cit>  structures, sam domains are capable of displaying a variety of protein interaction surfaces despite their relatively small size. over the last five years, the repertoire of sam domain/ligand interactions has been extended to include nucleic acids and lipids. reinforcing the versatility of the fold, the surfaces employed by this emerging class of sam domains are distinct from their protein-binding counterparts. for example, the vts <dig> and smaug sam domains bind specific pentaloop hairpin rnas at a shallow site that draws upon contributions from helices h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . the p <dig> sam domain has been demonstrated to partially embed in both anionic and zwitterionic lipid membranes accompanied by predicted conformational changes in helices h <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> .

four isoforms of human dlc <dig>  have been reported  <cit> . dlc2α and dlc2β exhibit only minor amino terminal deletions before the sam domain. dlc2γ lacks the sam domain while dlc2δ is a very short deletion  only possessing a sam domain. at present, no information is available regarding cells overexpressing the dlcδ isoform. does the overexpression of the sam domain bind and suppress other signaling protein partners leading to a phenotypic change? of note, only the dlc2γ isoform could be stably expressed in hepg <dig> hepatoma cells suggesting the sam domain may increase the suppressive strength of signals through rho.

in yeast, the ste50-sam domain acts as a high-affinity beacon that recruits the ste <dig> map kinase to cdc <dig> gtpase-associated complexes involved in filamentous growth and the response to high osmolarity environment  <cit> . with its unique four-helix bundle fold and hydrophobic surface lined with aromatic residues, the dlc2-sam domain may serve an analogous role by coupling receiver and effector proteins to inactive rho- and cdc42-associated complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
the dlc2-sam domain structure appears to be a hybrid of a sam domain and an anti-parallel four-helix bundle. as a result, dlc <dig> may interact with a new class of biomolecular ligands, including peptides and lipids.

note added in proof
during revision of this manuscript, a structural study of the human dlc2-sam domain was published  <cit> . since coordinates of human dlc <dig>  were unavailable, we could not perform a detailed comparison with the murine dlc2-sam domain fragment presented in this study. in general terms, the number and position of the secondary structures of the human dlc2-sam domain, as well as its topology, are in agreement with our murine dlc2-sam data. furthermore, we obtained a comparable correlation time indicating that both the human and murine dlc2-sam domains occur in a predominantly monomeric form over a wide range of concentrations.
