BACKGROUND
the p <dig> tumor suppressor is certainly one of the most studied sequence-specific transcription factor to date. yet, much has still to be learned to fully describe its transcriptional regulatory network, both in terms of the crosstalk with other transcription factors and in terms of the entire spectrum of regulated transcriptional target genes, that can be both up-regulated or down-regulated .

recently, several genome-scale techniques such as chip-on-chip, chip-seq, and, more recently, chip-exo, have provided us with different and largely non-overlapping maps of p <dig> bound sites in the human genome in response to specific stimuli . correlation between occupancy data and modulation of transcription levels of nearby genes helped identifying additional direct p <dig> target genes, of which > <dig> have been established  <cit> . furthermore, new methodologies are refining the potential to map the p <dig> network taking also into account the kinetics of transcriptional initiation  <cit> . it is worth noting that, to date, most experiments have been developed in cancer-derived cell lines that may represent an adapted environment potentially biasing a comprehensive annotation of physiological p <dig> target sites  <cit> . to this respect, the impact of specific p53-inducing stimuli and the differentiation/tissue context of the cell have not been systematically investigated  <cit> .

considerable attention has been given to the sequence and structural features of p <dig> binding sites that provide for p <dig> recruitment to target sites  <cit> . it is now more clear that the loose definition of p <dig> response element   <cit>  that has been used for many years comprises a wide range of dna binding affinity, occupancy rates and transactivation potentials measured by various types of assays, and that specific differences in the definition of p <dig> res are evident between purely in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo occupancy measurements .

the canonical p <dig> consensus found in many identified binding sites of mostly up-regulated p <dig> target genes consists of two copies of the palindromic half-site rrrcwwgyyy separated by a spacer of 0–13 bp, in which r = purine, w = a or t and y = pyrimidine. theoretically, each p <dig> monomer binds five nucleotides – i.e., one monomer binds the i° quarter site r1r2r3c1w <dig> and the second monomer the ii° quarter site w2g1y1y2y3-. as reviewed previously, the rather degenerate p <dig> consensus sequence, reflects the established observation that in virtually all cases of validated p <dig> res, an optimal consensus site is not found, because of mismatches, in some cases resulting in partial binding sites, referred to as non-canonical res  <cit> . this has raised the hypothesis of a selection pressure to limit the intrinsic potential of p <dig> proteins to target binding sites, thereby allowing for modulation of p53-induced transcriptional changes by signal transduction pathways affecting p <dig> protein amount, dna binding potential, quaternary structures and/or availability of multiple trans-factors . for example, p <dig> res with lower dna binding affinity appear to be more frequent in target genes involved in apoptosis  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, optimized p <dig> res have been recently studied in experimental models and in vitro for their kinetic and thermodynamic interactions with p <dig> as well as transactivation potential and shown to provide for high level of p53-mediated transactivation even at low p <dig> protein levels  <cit> .

functional assays in a defined experimental setting provided by the yeast s. cerevisiae have been extensively used to characterize the transactivation potential of p <dig> re in isogenic conditions and exploit variable expression of p <dig> under an inducible promoter to yield a matrix of transactivation results, to some extent comparable in precision to that of a biochemical assay in a test tube . further, high correlation was reported between results in yeast and transactivation or occupancy data in cancer cell lines  <cit> . for example, experiments in this model system led to identify functionally active half-site and 3/ <dig> site  p <dig> res, a group of res collectively considered as non-canonical that were then mapped and validated also in human cells  <cit> .

here we have combined all the data obtained so far with the yeast-based p <dig> transactivation assay and developed an algorithm, p53retriever, to scan dna sequences, identify p <dig> res and classify them based on predicted transactivation potential into five broad categories. as unique features, this algorithm takes into account cooperative interactions between groups of mismatches in two p <dig> dimers and scores also non-canonical res.

specifically we used this approach to map functional p <dig> res in the proximity of all annotated coding genes, searched for high affinity p <dig> res in the entire genome, and mapped functional p <dig> res within encode-defined distant enhancer regions. the predictive power of mapping p <dig> res with high functional score near transcription start sites  was validated for a panel of  <dig> genes, using cell lines differing for p <dig> status, two p53-inducing stimuli and measuring relative expression by qpcr at three time points. apobec3h, e2f <dig>  gas <dig>  trim <dig>  pde2a, kctd <dig>  dicer, map2k <dig>  dnaja <dig>  hras, kitlg, tgfa and potentially yap <dig> were confirmed or identified as p <dig> target genes.

RESULTS
development and implementation of p53retriever, a pattern search code that identifies canonical and non-canonical p <dig> res based on predictions from transactivation assays
in general, the degree of p <dig> binding depends on various factors including the state of the p <dig> protein, its cofactors, and the sequence composition of the p53-re  <cit> . because easier to predict than the p <dig> state, computational algorithms were developed to explore p <dig> binding through sequence motif analysis. the majority of these algorithms, such as p53mh  <cit> , do not directly consider the response element  potential to drive p53-dependent transactivation. on the contrary, p53retriever is based on a set of manually curated rules, derived from a compendium of p <dig> transactivation data obtained using a yeast-based assay  <cit> .

res are scored from five  to one  . the grade represents the inferred transactivation potential rather than being an indication of the percent similarity to the canonical p <dig> consensus sequence. for full site p <dig> res the grade considers a severe negative impact of a spacer between the two half sites larger than two nucleotides . variable p53-re spacer lengths are known to affect transactivation capacity. only two previous studies tried to incorporate the spacer length as one of the relevant features  <cit> , calculating a penalty score directly proportional to spacer length. also in our algorithm, based on previous results, we attribute high negative impact to spacers longer than two nucleotides . indeed, res with a long spacer length are also confirmed to be rarely bound by p <dig> in vivo  <cit> . many of the computational approaches for identifying putative p53-res define how similar that putative binding site is to the consensus, but do not consider the local context of single mismatches within the re. in our approach mismatches from consensus are also weighted depending on their position within the re 20-mer sequence, given the finding that mismatches in the quarter sites at the interface between the two half sites have a more severe impact likely due to cooperative interactions among two p <dig> dimers  <cit>  . in addition, interaction effects between groups of mismatches are also considered. in general, any combination of mismatches is penalized in a different way according to their location, considering that p <dig> is functionally active as a tetramer, that each p <dig> monomer interacts with a 5 nt motif  and that the p <dig> tetramer is thought to be assembled as a dimer of dimers  <cit> . if groups of mismatches are localized in the same “quarter” of the re, the score is less penalized than if the same mismatches were scattered in different quarters . importantly, non-canonical res consisting of 3q sites and ½ sites  <cit>  are considered functional p <dig> res with specific pattern searches. a graphical view of these features presented as “penalty matrix” summarizes the main features of our pattern search . the complete list of the rules used to attribute the functional score is presented . the p53retriever pattern search algorithm, together with functions to better visualize search results, has been implemented as an r package and is available for download at: http://tomateba.github.io/p53retriever.fig.  <dig> summary of re sequence features and associated grades in p53retriever. a grade: classification of res reflecting associated functional scores. the color code matching the  <dig> different grades will be maintained in all figures. b mismatch label: classification of mismatches in different positions. high penalties are given to mismatches located in the core consensus sequence , lower penalties are given when mismatches are gradually distant from the core . label o is given to a site without mismatches. mismatches group penalties: different penalties are attributed to groups of mismatches according to how they are scattered or grouped along the site. c schematic representation of the main rules on which p53retriever search algorithm is based. the full list of rules is listed in additional file  <dig>  the p <dig> consensus sequence is presented, grouping dinucleotide motifs that were revealed to provide a specific impact on transactivation potentials, based on our previous studies   <cit> . penalties are indicated by an increment in the number of the “-” symbol and a color code broadly matching the grade scale. single mismatches are more penalized when affecting a base in the internal portion of the re, as indicated. on the contrary, the at motif at the center of the cwwg core is a positive feature, particularly in the case of non-canonical res 



distribution of identified p <dig> response elements around human promoters
we applied p53retriever to the set of sequences in the human genome placed around annotated transcriptional start sites , selecting a window from -10 kb to 10 kb. the entire list of identified res, chromosomal coordinates, official gene name, distance from tss and re sequence features resulting in the given grade, is available in additional file  <dig> 

the distribution of identified p <dig> res grouped based on the functional score, shows a very large preponderance of “grade 1” res, that are considered as unlikely functional . also, the distribution of re scores is highly skewed, with only  <dig>  % of res obtaining the highest grade, supporting the hypothesis of a selecting pressure to reduce p <dig> binding affinity and provide plasticity in the modulation of p53-mediated stress responses in vivo  <cit> . very recent analyses confirmed that p <dig> res that are more highly conserved in evolution are relatively weak p <dig> re sites displaying lower levels of occupancy compared to higher affinity res that exhibit low evolutionary conservation  <cit> . grade five sequences either lack entirely mismatches, or contain two or fewer mismatches in the external positions , and contain the positive at motif in the cwwg core. the vast majority of res that can be considered functional are in the grade two category. predicted to be poorly responsive on their own, these res could participate in the regulation of gene expression conditional to other features, such as the local sequence context of promoter architecture. included in the grade two category are ~30 % of all half sites mapped . a unique feature of our search tool is the specific pattern search for non-canonical 3q sites. interestingly, even though mismatches in the two internal quarter sites have an higher impact on p <dig> transactivation for 3q sites compared to full sites, and thus result in a final lower grade, many 3q sites obtained a grade higher than  <dig>  hence, a great number  of p <dig> res are predicted to be functional even though the entire motif is not present. this observation strongly supports recent reports suggesting that p <dig> res match the consensus in one half site, with the two central quarter sites being somehow less variable  <cit> . it is also consistent with the recent report of the frequent identification of p <dig> half-sites among p <dig> chip-seq peaks lacking full sites  <cit> .fig.  <dig> analysis of p <dig> res found in human promoters. a pie chart displaying the distribution of grades associated to res found in all human promoters. b comparison between the frequencies of res found in human promoters, and the frequencies of res found in scrambled promoter sequences after applying local permutations . the comparison is shown for each grade. the ratio is  <dig> if the frequency is the same, >  <dig> if the frequency is higher in real promoters, < <dig> if the frequency is higher in scrambled promoters. all enrichments are significant, the binomial test p-value is  <dig> e- <dig> for grade  <dig> , <1e- <dig> for all the other grades . c p <dig> occupancy metaprofile, based on the position of res in all human promoters, centered on the tss position. the grey histogram displays the probability distribution of all res independently from the grade. colored lines represent the density distribution of res with higher grades . the specific positions of grade  <dig> res are dotted in yellow under the histogram. d p <dig> occupancy metaprofile, based on the position of res in the human promoters of  <dig> p <dig> target genes, published in  <cit> . the color scheme is the same as in panel c. the specific positions of grade  <dig> and  <dig> res are dotted under the histogram 



we compared the results obtained searching within human promoters with what we would expect by chance, by applying p53retriever to sets of scrambled sequences obtained by local permutations of real promoter sequences . local permutations allowed us to preserve the local gc content of promoter regions, showing in fact an increase in gc content around the tss . from this analysis we could determine that the frequency of res in the global set of human promoters is slightly but significantly higher than the frequency of res in scrambled sequences . this soft enrichment is plausible, given that we are considering all known human tss and not specific populations of genes. grade five and three are the most enriched class of res when comparing the frequency of each grade .

mapping all the res considering their position with respect to the tss, we obtained an occupancy metaprofile of p <dig> res, displayed in fig. 2c. this occupancy profile reveals a general decrease of res in the region proximal to tss . this decrease affects all res, independently from the grade, and appears to be a consequence of the local increase in gc content, since we observed the same effect in scrambled sequences when applying local permutations . overall the res reduction  could be interpreted as a selection against a high density of active p <dig> res from promoter regions of non-target genes that is limited to about  <dig> kbs from tss. this reduction is driven by the general increase in gc content around the tss, which more globally is instrumental in the interplay between chromatin conformation and transcription processes. on the other hand, when restricting our analysis to the promoter region of known p <dig> targets, we found an entirely different landscape. fig. 2d displays the promoter occupancy metaprofile of res identified by p53retriever in a group of  <dig> hgnc genes listed as targets of p <dig> in literature and collected in  <cit> . interestingly, this profile shows the highest probability density in the region closer to the tss, especially for functional res with grade four and five . indeed, recent data reported a prevalence of p <dig> res nearby the tss of known target genes  <cit> .

comparison with other p <dig> binding site datasets and search tools
to further verify if p53retriever recognized already established p <dig> binding sites, we compared our approach with lists of p <dig> target genes and res previously reported. the detailed results of all comparisons are contained in additional file  <dig> 

first, we used our method to score  <dig> res sequences that are consistently bound by p <dig> according to seven different chip-seq datasets, reported in  <cit> . all these sequences were picked by p53retriever as potentially functional. interestingly, excluding one sequence, all p <dig> res from this list obtained a grade greater than one with the majority being of grade  <dig>  confirming that our tool can discriminate functional and well-known res .fig.  <dig> comparison of p53retriever with other p <dig> binding site datasets and tools. a pie chart displaying p53retriever classification on a list of  <dig> regions commonly identified by  <dig> different chip-seq experiments  <cit> . b left panel: pie chart displaying p53retriever classification on a list of  <dig> regions identified by chip-exo  <cit> . right panel: boxplot displaying for each grade assigned by p53retriever to chip-exo sequences, the distribution of the corresponding chip-exo occupancies, measured in  <cit> . n.g. = no grade given by p53retriever. c pie chart displaying p53retriever classification on a list of  <dig> regions identified by chip-seq in  <cit> . d p <dig> target gene lists from curated databases  or from expression datasets  were compared to the list of p <dig> promoter res obtained with p53retriever. presented in the bar graph are the predicted p <dig> res grouped by the maximum functional grade identified by p53retriever in their promoter. e comparison between p <dig> res identified in human promoters by p53retriever, and the corresponding score given by jaspar p <dig> pwm , based on chipseq data. res are divided in  <dig> groups along the horizontal axis, corresponding to the grade assigned by p53retriever. for each group, the distribution of the scores given by jaspar pwm is represented as a violin plot, i.e., a box plot with a rotated kernel density plot on each side. jaspar scores range from  <dig>  to  <dig> 



next, we applied p53retriever on p <dig> res obtained by chip-exo analysis  <cit> , providing near-nucleotide resolution of p <dig> bound sites in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses. . while 28 % of sites were not classified, the majority of bound sequences from chip-exo obtained a grade greater than  <dig>  with a predominance of grade four and five, . interestingly, we saw a clear correlation between higher relative occupancy and higher re grade . looking in more detail to the “no grade” group, we noticed that all non-scored sequences differed from the canonical re site for features which are highly penalized by our algorithm, like a number of mismatches higher than three scattered on three different quarter sites. nevertheless, we could show that these not-scored sequences are mostly characterized by low occupancy values . consistently, when considering the subset of regions increasingly bound by p <dig> after all the stimuli used in  <cit> , the percentage of “no grade” drops to  <dig>  % .

we also extended the comparison to a chip-seq dataset, reported in  <cit>   and obtained an overall similar distribution of re grades. the percentage of regions with “no grade” is  <dig>  %.

next, we extended the comparisons to other lists of res, starting from two small collections of reported p <dig> res, based on heterogeneous experimental approaches  <cit> . only a minority of those res obtained the highest grade, and the proportion of sequences not scored as potentially functional was approximately 40 % . it has to be said that the res reported in those lists are not guaranteed to be the ones actually or solely responsible for the responsiveness of the associated genes to p <dig> 

even though total mrna levels are an indirect measurement of p <dig> transcriptional activity, they reflect the transcriptome status upon p <dig> activation. thus, we did an additional comparison using microarray data obtained after p <dig> activation upon doxorubicin treatment of mcf <dig> cells  <cit> . the majority of differentially expressed, up-regulated genes turned out to have a p <dig> binding sites with grade three , and exhibited a specific enrichment of res with grade > <dig> near the tss . similar comparisons were done with lists of p <dig> target genes in curated databases such as transfac and ipa. again, the majority of these genes have a re of grade three predicted by p53retriever in their promoter region . using ingenuity pathway analysis , grade five and grade four human promoters revealed a strong p <dig> pathway signature .

finally, we compared p53retriever results with the standard pwm approach, using two pwms provided by the jaspar database . all res identified by p53retriever in the set of human promoters were scored in parallel with both jaspar pwms: the comparison with the jaspar pwm derived from chipseq data is shown in fig. 3e. although there is a high agreement on res with the maximum grade, very close to the optimal p <dig> consensus, the comparison shows divergences between the two methods for the lower grades. for example, a considerable population of res assigned to grade four by p53retriever receives very low scores from jaspar. this is likely due to the presence of ¾ sites that are over-penalized by the pwm approach. on the other hand, many res with low grades are highly scored by jaspar, that doesn’t penalize groups of scattered mismatches. apart from grade  <dig>  we can observe a linear trend between the two scoring systems if we look at the median values of the boxplots displayed in fig. 3e, so we can conclude that the two approaches are distinct and complementary. on the other hand, the second jaspar matrix, based on selex data, gives misleading results, since even optimal res  receive low scores .

high grade p <dig> res are enriched in distant enhancers
recent functional genomics approaches, particularly resulting from the encode initiative, have revealed that transcription is rather pervasive, that enhancer sequence can be very distant, at least in terms of primary sequence, from genes, and that active enhancers can be mapped based on specific histone code marks  <cit> . hence, we exploited this rich body of available information to map p <dig> res in distal enhancer sites, using dnase hypersensitive sites tracks. we filtered out sites overlapping with promoter regions defined in the previous sections, and considered a population of  <dig>  distal regions, whose length distribution is displayed in fig. 4a. p53retriever was run on this set of regions, and the complete results are provided in additional file  <dig>  the grade distribution of res found in distal dnase regions is displayed in fig. 4b. the frequency of res in these regions is significantly higher than the frequency found in human promoters and also in random sequences . the overall fold enrichment is  <dig> , but this trend grows proportionally to the grade of the res, reaching a peak with grade  <dig>  in fact,  <dig> high grade res are found within dnase hypersensitive sites , more than in the entire human promoter dataset. the fold enrichment of grade five res is  <dig>  . presently, it is undetermined if this enrichment for high quality binding sites reflects a common trend for sequence-specific transcription factors or a distinct feature of p <dig> family proteins. consistent with our results, higher levels of p <dig> occupancy in distal enhancers compared to promoters was very recently reported based on chip-seq analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with doxorubicin  <cit> . additionally, chip-seq analysis reported in  <cit>  allowed us to expand the study of p <dig> res in enhancers regions. in fact that paper provided p <dig> bound regions classified as enhancers based on encode annotation or as proto-enhancers, where p <dig> could act as pioneer transcription factor. interestingly, this latter group showed an enrichment for high scoring  p <dig> res according to p53retriever and a lower proportion of sequences with no grade .fig.  <dig> analysis of p <dig> res found in distal dnase hypersensitive regions. a boxplot of the nucleotide length of human distal dnase hypersensitive regions, determined as described in methods. b pie chart displaying the distribution of grades associated to res found in human distal dnase hypersensitive regions. c comparison between the frequencies of res found in human distal dnase hypersensitive regions, and the frequencies of res found in random sequences with the same gc content. the comparison is shown for each grade. the ratio is  <dig> if the frequency is the same , >  <dig> if the frequency is higher in dnase regions, < <dig> if the frequency is higher in random sequences. all enrichments of res mapped to distal dnase hypersensitive regions are highly significant . d pie charts displaying p53retriever classification on two lists of regions identified by chip-seq in  <cit>  as proto-enhancers  and enhancers 



new direct p <dig> target genes identified based on the p <dig> re functional search tool
high-activity, or non-canonical p <dig> res predicted to be moderately active were mapped by our tools near the tss of genes that are not completely established or novel putative direct p <dig> target genes. to infer the predictive power of the pattern search on p53-dependent transcriptional changes,  <dig> genes were selected and their expression was tested followed by qpcr in cell lines differing for p <dig> status  and at different time points  after p <dig> activation by two different treatments, i.e., doxorubicin -a genotoxic chemotherapeutic drug- and nutlin-3a -an mdm <dig> inhibitor-  . results support p53-dependent up-regulation for most genes. the p53-dependency is confirmed by the absence of induction in hct p53−/− and mcf7shp <dig> cell lines, despite the different p <dig> status between the two cells lines . in some cases, the increase in gene expression compared to the mock condition was time-dependent. differences in these kinetic features were apparent between the two treatments applied. e2f <dig> was inducible by doxorubicin at different time points, while after nutlin-3a treatment an early up-regulation was followed by repression, which appeared to be p53-dependent. gas <dig> and kctd <dig> had a similar trend especially in mcf <dig> cells. differences were noted between mcf <dig> and the mcf7-vector derivative clone in the magnitude or the kinetics of relative expression changes . nine of the thirteen candidates  were selected among the list of genes having both a predicted binding sites in our algorithm output with a grade higher or equal to  <dig>  and a reported p <dig> binding sites on chipseq datasets  <cit> . for all of them except trim <dig>  total mrna levels are also reported as upregulated after doxorubicin treatment by microarray data  <cit> . although the induction is not directly proportional to the grade, we confirmed p <dig> dependent induction by qpcr for all of them in time/cell line dependent manner. even though trim <dig> is not upregulated after doxorubicin treatment in all the tested cell lines, it is upregulated upon nutlin-3a treatment, confirming chip-seq data. besides their p <dig> binding sites, these candidates were selected because of their reported involvement in cell-cycle control and tumor progression , in transcription , and dna editing  .fig  <dig> p53-responsiveness of target genes associated with predicted functional res. a qpcr results of  <dig> selected genes. fold of changes values  upon each treatment are presented as a heatmap. upper part shows mrnas level after nutlin-3a treatment while the lower shows the same after doxorubicin  treatment. expression levels were tested in different cell lines  and at different time points  . for each gene, the “grade” column presents the binding site grade reported by our algorithm. “chipseq” column shows the presence  or absence  of reported p <dig> binding sites  <cit> . “doxo” column presents mrna levels obtained by microarray data  <cit> . b positional representation of p <dig> binding sites in tss proximity for dicer, yap <dig>  dnaja <dig>  map2k <dig>  bar height is proportional to the binding site grade. grade  <dig> is yellow, grade  <dig> is red, grade  <dig> is green, grade  <dig> is blue and grade  <dig> is grey. c p <dig> occupancy on the promoter of dicer, yap <dig>  dnaja <dig> and map2k <dig> comparing mock and doxo condition in mcf <dig> cells. p <dig>  well-known p <dig> direct target, is a positive control. actb is used as a reference. sites validated by chip are indicated by a * symbol in figure 5b




for the remaining four genes, whose res are displayed in fig. 5b, we performed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiment in mcf <dig> cells treated with doxorubicin for 16 h. weak p <dig> occupancy was observed by qpcr at dnaja <dig> and map2k <dig> loci after doxorubicin treatment, while a region containing a predicted grade  <dig> category p <dig> re in the yap <dig> gene showed evidence for p <dig> occupancy in the mock condition. our results did not support direct p <dig> binding to the dicer promoter, consistent with a previous study  <cit>  .

overall, we propose dnaja <dig>  map2k <dig> and potentially yap <dig> as new direct p <dig> target genes, although the level of transactivation was relatively low.

dnaja <dig> can act as a co-chaperone of hsc <dig> that was previously associated to radioresistance phenotype in wild type p <dig> glioblastoma cells treated with farnesyltransferase inhibitors  <cit> . recently, overexpression of dnaja <dig> was associated with a reduction of pancreatic cancer cell survival and with c-jun repression  <cit> .

map2k <dig> participates in the map kinase cascade and can phosphorylate p <dig>  this protein was identified as a senescence-promoting factor in human breast epithelial cells  <cit> . however, it has also been associated to tumor invasion potential and to be regulated at transcriptional level by nfy, nf-κb and gain-of-function mutant p <dig>  <cit> .

the yes-associated protein  <dig>  is a transcriptional regulator involved in the hippo signaling pathway. evidences support both an oncogenic and a tumor suppressor role for yap <dig>  linked to abl1-induced apoptosis  <cit> . yap <dig> protein was found capable to bind the p <dig> promoter and a positive feedback loop was proposed based on the finding that p <dig> can bind the yap promoter  <cit> . in part consistent with this view we found p53-dependent yap <dig> gene up-regulation both after doxorubicin and nutlin-3a treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
several previous tools were developed to identify bona fide p <dig> response elements, starting with pioneering in vitro selection experiments that led to the initial and still accepted definition of the consensus p <dig> re  <cit> . the majority of these tools were based on position weight matrices derived from results of in vitro approaches, namely competitive gel shift assays and selex, more recently integrated with results obtained from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. a systematic effort to quantify changes in dna binding affinity  using fluorescence anisotropy titration led to the development of a p <dig> binding site predictor algorithm  <cit> . this tool was also used to search genome wide for high affinity p <dig> res and to map naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms  that can impact on the dna binding affinity of p <dig>  the functional relevance of snps within p <dig> res has been established in several reports  <cit> .

all position weight matrix approaches assume additive contributions of the individual positions within the re sequence, and except for  <cit>  and  <cit> , all tools do not specifically weigh the impact of spacers between half site decameric re motifs in the 0-13 nt range. this spacer length was in fact considered neutral in the initial in vitro experiments  <cit> . however, dna binding assays where re sequence are embedded in longer dna molecules, competitive binding experiments in microfluidics, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, yeast- and mammalian-cell based transactivation assays all indicate that even a single nucleotide spacer between p <dig> re half sites can reduce transactivation potential  <cit> . in fact, when the spacer is longer than 2–3 nt the two decameric half sites no longer show cooperative interactions  <cit> , although when the distance in primary sequence approach one helical pass, transactivation potential appears to increase beyond additivity  <cit> , yet remaining much lower compared to the absence of a spacer. the negative impact of spacer is even more dramatic for tap <dig>  <cit>  and tap <dig> proteins, but not for Δnp <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that the structure as well as the sequence of dna binding sites can lead to conformational changes in the quaternary tetrameric structure of p <dig> family proteins, and that intrinsic differences exist in the oligomerization state of these proteins  <cit> .

we have coded in p53retriever sequence and structural features of p <dig> res impacting on transactivation potential that were revealed in the past several years using our yeast-based transactivation assay  <cit> . the resulting algorithm has several distinctive features compared to previous tools, particularly for scoring interactions among groups of mismatches, non-canonical 3q sites and half sites p <dig> res, weighing the impact of consensus mismatches considering their position within the full site re sequence, i.e., giving higher penalty to mismatches in the two internal quarter sites, and weighs consensus sequence variations within dinucleotide motifs in the core and flanking regions  <cit>  . possible interactions between nearby half site p <dig> res or clusters of full site and 3q sites are currently not considered by our algorithm.

we mapped and ranked functional res near tss for all annotated transcripts in ucsc . further, we exploited encode data and provide a cartography of ranked p <dig> res within distant dnase hypersensitive sites, considered as distant enhancers . in these regions we found a significant 16-fold enrichment of high grade res with respect to the basal frequency expected by chance or observed in promoter regions. an enrichment for high grade res was also found among proto-enhancer sequences bound by p <dig> identified by chip-seq  <cit> . it is worth noting that our results represent a projection from all dnase hypersensitive sites, irrespective of the specific tissues in which they are active. tissue variability may influence which res are selectively bound. an additional layer of complexity is represented by the known interplay between different transcription factors. this important aspect is not included in our analysis that is focused on p <dig> alone.

although the data on which the algorithm is construed are the outcome of transactivation assays measured from chromatinized promoter-reporter construct, the isogenic nature of the yeast-based functional assays, minimizes most variables potentially impacting on transactivation by p53; at the same time distinct chromatin features of the natural context of the res’ location in vivo may certainly influence the associated gene transcriptional responsiveness to p <dig>  hence the yeast-based results might be more similar to chip-seq and chip-exo results, albeit with a more quantitative power.

undoubtedly different chip-seq experiments do not agree with each other and there is limited overlap among the results obtained with different cell lines or using different treatments to activate p <dig>  while global differences in occupancy could be related to differences in accessibility between different tissue-derived cells or to distinct p <dig> post-translational modifications or cofactors activated by different treatments, it was interesting to find that the list of p <dig> bound sites that are common to multiple chip-experiments were highly enriched for high scoring  res and none of them failed to be classified by our tool . instead, when examining individual chip-seq or even, although to a lower extent, chip-exo data, 20 % to 30 % of p <dig> bound fragments did not contain a motif scored by p53retriever. while those sites may represent examples of p <dig> proteins tethered to dna by protein interactions, the manual inspection of “no grade” sites from the chip-exo datasets showed that the majority of these sites resemble p <dig> response elements but contain several  “core” mismatches scattered on three different quarter sites. these multiple mismatched res are not presently scored by p53retriever, but would probably result in weak responsiveness. consistently, the majority of no grade chip-exo res showed lower occupancies .

finally, we decided to validate a few of the predictions from the pattern search, particularly for non-canonical 3q sites using cell lines as a model.  <dig> genes with mapped functional res were chosen. overall, despite our algorithm doesn’t consider the system complexity of transcriptional regulation in living cells and the response variability upon each different p <dig> stimulus, results support p53-dependent transactivation for the majority of them. based on the combined qpcr and chip results we conclude that dnaja <dig>  map2k <dig>  and potentially yap <dig> can be considered new direct p <dig> target genes, linking p <dig> to yet additional potential biological outcomes. furthermore, our data further establish the very recent findings of pde2a, gas <dig>  e2f <dig>  apobec3h, kctd <dig>  trim <dig>  hras, kitlg and tgfa as p <dig> target genes.
