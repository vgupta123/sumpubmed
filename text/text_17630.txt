BACKGROUND
chickpea  is the 4th most important grain-legume crop after soybean, bean, and pea, but contributes only  <dig> % to the world grain legumes production  , assessed on 27th january 2008). worldwide chickpea production in  <dig> was  <dig>  million tonnes  from an area of  <dig>  million ha, and average productivity of  <dig>  t ha- <dig>  asia contributes  <dig> % , africa  <dig> % , north and central america  <dig> % , oceania  <dig> %  and europe  <dig> %  to world chickpea production. over  <dig> countries grow chickpea; however, india, turkey, pakistan, iran, canada, myanmar, mexico, ethiopia, and australia together contribute  <dig> % of the global chickpea production. although north and central america and oceania together contribute only  <dig> % of the world chickpea production, these regions have the highest recorded chickpea productivity . in contrast, asia and africa show the lowest productivity  while contributing  <dig> % of the world chickpea production. several biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> , its narrow genetic base  <cit>  probably as a consequence of its monophyletic descendent from its wild progenitor c. reticulatum in the fertile crescent  <cit>  and lack of adapted varieties contribute to fluctuations in chickpea yield.

chickpea is a self-pollinated crop, with 2n = 2x =  <dig> chromosomes and genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . the two distinct forms of cultivated chickpeas are desi types  and kabuli types . a third type, designated as pea-shaped, is characterized by medium to small seed size, and cream coloured seeds. the desi types are primarily grown in south asia, while kabuli types mainly in mediterranean region. chickpea is the good source of carbohydrates and proteins, together contributing about 80% of the total seed dry weight. the chickpea grains are rich in minerals and vitamins, and also forms a good source of livestock feed.

vast collections of chickpea germplasm are maintained by two cgiar  centers: the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics , patancheru, india and the international center for agricultural research in the dry areas , aleppo, syrian arab republic. the former maintains  <dig>  accessions  while the latter  <dig>  accessions . in spite of such an impressive number of germplasm accessions available in the genebanks, there has been very limited use of these accessions in genetic enhancement of chickpea. for example, the chickpea breeders in icrisat used only  <dig> germplasm lines during the period from  <dig> to  <dig> in comparison to the use of  <dig> breeding lines for the development of  <dig> advanced varieties. a similar situation was noted at icarda, wherein the chickpea breeders during the same period used approximately  <dig> germplasm lines in their crosses, compared to approximately  <dig> breeding lines in generating breeding materials, from which  <dig> cultivars were released. india is the largest producer of chickpea and has a very strong chickpea improvement program, which released  <dig> cultivars during  <dig> to  <dig>  the pedigree analysis of the  <dig> released cultivars, developed through hybridization, indicated that though  <dig> ancestors were involved in their development, only  <dig> accessions contributed to 35% of the genetic base  <cit> .

the development of core and mini-core collections has been suggested as a gateway to the utilization of genetic diversity in crop improvement  <cit> . in chickpea, core and mini core subsets have been reported  <cit> . more recently, a composite collection of  <dig> accessions have been developed  <cit>  which included the  <dig> accessions of the icrisat core collection  <cit> ,  <dig> icarda cultivated genebank accessions,  <dig> advanced breeding lines and cultivars and  <dig> trait-specific accessions   <cit> , and  <dig> wild cicer species  accessions. both c. echinospermum and c. reticulatum are cross compatible with cultivated chickpea , and reported resistant to several pests  and diseases , tolerance to cold, and high seed protein content in c. reticulatum  <cit> . this composite collection consists of 80% landraces, 9% advanced breeding lines, 2% cultivars, 1% wild relatives, and 8% for which precise status is unknown. geographically, 39% of the composite collection originates from south and south-east asia , 25% from west asia , and 22% from the mediterranean region. africa and americas each contribute 5% of the collection. this composite collection thus represents a wide spectrum of genetic diversity captured from the entire collection of chickpea germplasm preserved in icrisat and icarda genebanks.

knowledge and management of the genetic diversity in cultivated and wild relatives are critical for any crop improvement programs. hybridization, seed protein electrophoresis and isozyme analysis, prior to the discovery of pcr-based markers, were used to establish genetic relationships among cicer species  <cit> . subsequently, markers such as random amplified polymorphic dna , restriction fragment length polymorphism , amplified fragment length polymorphism , inter simple sequence repeat , and simple sequence repeat   were used to study the genetic diversity and species relationships in chickpea; with most of these studies reporting abundant diversity in wild cicer but limited variation in cultivated chickpea  <cit> . efforts were directed towards the discovery and characterization of large number of ssr markers in chickpea  <cit> . limited studies on ssr-based genetic diversity revealed sufficient polymorphisms in chickpea that led to the construction of genetic linkage maps and identification of quantitative trait loci  associated with few traits of significant agricultural importance  <cit> .

in this article, we analyze the genetic structure, diversity and allelic richness in a composite collection, using ssr markers, and report the formation of a genotype-based reference set of  <dig> accessions for diverse applications in chickpea genomics and breeding.

RESULTS
allelic richness and diversity in composite collection
the forty-eight ssr markers detected a total of  <dig> alleles in  <dig> chickpea accessions. the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> alleles per locus . the polymorphic information content  values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig> . most of the markers, except for castms <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  and ts <dig>  were highly polymorphic. gene diversity is defined as the probability that two randomly chosen alleles from the population are different. it varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , with an average of  <dig> . a very low level of heterozygosity  was detected in the investigated materials,  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with an average of  <dig> %. fifteen ssr loci detected no heterozygosity while nineteen, six, seven, and one loci, respectively, detected < 1%, < 2%, < 3%, and < 4% heterozygosity in  <dig> accessions. correlation analysis revealed that allele size range was significantly associated with alleles per locus  and gene diversity ; alleles per locus with gene diversity ; common alleles with allele range size , alleles per locus , and gene diversity ; rare alleles with allele range size , alleles per locus , and gene diversity . significant and positive relationships were observed between allele size range and the amount of variation at ssr loci  indicate that ssr loci with large allele range  show greater variation, and agree with the idea that replication slippage plays an important role in the generation of new alleles at ssr loci  <cit> .

of the  <dig> alleles detected in the composite collection,  <dig> were rare,  <dig> common, and  <dig> most frequent alleles . rare and common alleles were detected at all the  <dig> ssr loci, the former ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  rare alleles per locus while the latter from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> common alleles per locus. in contrast, only  <dig> ssr loci detected  <dig> to  <dig> most frequent alleles in the composite collection. average allele range size of the markers with trinucleotide repeat motifs was greater  than those either with dinucleotide  or compound  repeat motifs markers.

heterozygosity in germplasm accessions
chickpea is a self pollinated crop. moreover, in this study, a single plant from each accession was harvested and parts of the seeds obtained from such plants were sown in greenhouse to raise seedlings for dna extraction. extreme care was taken to avoid inadvertent seed mixtures. in spite of this, allelic heterozygosity was detected in chickpea accessions that ranged from one to  <dig> loci in  <dig> accessions : one locus heterozygous in  <dig>  two loci in  <dig>  three loci in  <dig>  four loci in  <dig>  five loci in  <dig>  six loci in  <dig>  seven and nine loci each in  <dig>  eight loci in  <dig>  ten loci in  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> loci each in  <dig> accessions . in the remaining  <dig> accessions, these markers detected no heterozygosity. a large collection of landraces was involved in this study and it is possible that these accessions still possess some residual heterozygosity at least at some ssr loci reported. a landrace is defined as an autochthonous  variety with a high capacity to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses, resulting in high yield stability and an intermediate yield level under a low input agricultural system  <cit> . the heterozygosity observed at some of the loci could also be due to high mutational rate and mutational bias at ssr loci  <cit> . the loci with large number of repeat units  tend to show high mutational rate  <cit> . as a result, any mutations in any one of the alleles may create a heterozygous condition. many of the loci which displayed heterozygous status have a large number of ssr units.

wild cicer accessions as a group were more heterozygous  than cultivated forms . mediterranean accessions were more heterozygous  than the accessions from rest of the geographic regions  .

biological and geographical diversity in the composite collection
biologically, the  <dig> accessions could be grouped into desi, kabuli and pea-shaped, among the cultivated chickpea types, and wild cicer accessions into a separate group while geographically they can be assigned to eight geographical regions, with another group of accessions of unknown origin. though kabuli and desi showed similar mean gene diversity, the kabuli's as a group were genetically more diverse  than desi's . interestingly, accessions from south america, europe and mediterranean regions were genetically more diverse  than those from other regions.

this study detected many rare, common, and unique alleles within each group . in the cultivated group, desi's contained the largest number of unique alleles  followed by kabuli  and pea-shaped . sixty-nine unique alleles differentiated wild cicer accessions from the cultivated chickpea germplasm. mediterranean and wa region accessions each have  <dig> unique alleles while ssea accessions  <dig> unique alleles. accessions from africa contained  <dig> unique alleles. of the  <dig> alleles detected in the composite collection, desi and kabuli germplasm shared the largest number of alleles  while wild cicer shared only  <dig> and  <dig> alleles with desi and kabuli accessions, respectively. pea-shaped type shared  <dig> alleles with desi and  <dig> alleles with kabuli. the accessions from ssea and wa shared  <dig> alleles while those from mediterranean shared  <dig> and  <dig> unique alleles with wa and ssea, respectively. african germplasm shared more alleles with ssea  than those from mediterranean  and wa . desi's contained a higher proportion of rare alleles  than kabuli's , while wild cicer accessions were devoid of rare alleles. the frequency of common alleles between desi and kabuli types ranged from 47% to 54%, while pea-shaped type had 99% common alleles. accessions from africa had more common alleles  than those from wa , mediterranean , and ssea . a very high proportion of common alleles  found in commonwealth of independent states , european, north central america  and south america  accessions probably revealed homogeneity in the genetic materials from these regions. these are the regions that also detected a very low number of unique and rare alleles.

several differences were detected in allelic richness in the composite collection. desi and kabuli types possess greater average number of alleles  than those from pea-shaped and wild cicer , with more alleles in desi than kabuli . african accessions had less alleles than those from the mediterranean, ssea, and wa  . the average allele size range in desi and kabuli types differ by  <dig> bp while pea-shaped differed from both the types by 47– <dig> bp . interestingly, mediterranean and ssea regions accessions had no difference in mean allele-size range . the african accessions, in contrast, differ by 36– <dig> bp from mediterranean and ssea region accessions. the wa region accessions differ by 3– <dig> bp from mediterranean and ssea.

variation in polymorphic information content  in composite collection and reference set
several differences were detected in marker polymorphism . lower pic values for most of the markers were found for the reference set than for the composite collection. however, a few markers were more polymorphic in the reference set than in the composite collection. for example, ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  and ta <dig> in desi type; castms <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ta <dig>  and ts <dig> in kabuli types; ncpgr <dig> and ncpgr <dig> in pea-shaped types were more polymorphic in reference set . region-specific differences in marker polymorphism were also detected: ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  and ta <dig> were more polymorphic in the reference set accessions included from african and mediterranean regions while none of these markers, except for ncpgr <dig>  were more polymorphic in ssea and wa region accessions included in the reference set .

genetic structure of the composite collection and a reference set
neighbour-joining tree based on simple matching dissimilarity matrix between  <dig> accessions of the composite collection highlighted two major groups, broadly representing kabuli and desi types . clearly, three subgroups could be seen in kabuli while four subgroups in desi types. further, a group of kabuli accessions clustered with desi types while a group of desi accessions formed a distinct subgroup within the kabuli types. no specific grouping was observed for the pea-shaped accessions, which dispersed in both the groups. wild cicer accessions clustered with kabuli types; however, c. reticulatum accessions  formed a distinct cluster separating those belonging to c. echinospermum . both belong to the primary gene pool and are cross compatible with c. arietinum, the cultivated chickpea.

a reference set of  <dig> accessions  was formed that captured  <dig> of the  <dig>  alleles detected in the composite collection of  <dig> accessions. the number of alleles per locus ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and averaged  <dig> alleles per locus. this reference set contained  <dig> rare and  <dig> common alleles. rare alleles ranged from 2– <dig>  averaged  <dig>  alleles per locus, while common alleles ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  averaged  <dig> alleles per locus. twenty-six of the  <dig> most frequent alleles of the composite collection were also detected in this reference set. the gene diversity varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , averaged  <dig>  per locus. neighbour-joining tree diagram of this reference set  represented diversity from all directions of the tree diagram of the composite collection . biologically, this reference set consists of  <dig> landraces,  <dig> advanced lines and cultivars,  <dig> wild cicer accessions, and  <dig> accessions with unknown biological status. geographically it consists of accessions from asia , africa , europe , mediterranean , americas , cis , and  <dig> accessions with unknown geographical origin. when accessions classified based on seed types, it has  <dig> desi,  <dig> kabuli, and  <dig> pea-shaped accessions among cultivated types and  <dig> wild cicer accessions .

rare, common, and most frequent alleles in composite collection and the reference set
the allelic composition revealed the predominance of rare and common alleles while the most frequent alleles are represented by ≤ 2% of the total number of alleles detected in the composite collection and reference set . however, the representation of common alleles in the reference set increased by  <dig> % while the rare and most frequent alleles decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. a large number of these alleles represented both in the composite collection and reference set:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rare, common, and most frequent alleles, respectively, in composite and reference set, though in varying frequency .

discussion
crop genetic resources and the diversity present in them provide an assurance for future genetic progress and an insurance against unforeseen threats to agricultural production. thus, genetic diversity is of utmost importance to increased yield, enhanced resistance to pests and diseases, and improved grain quality . chickpea, like other legumes, has a narrow genetic base in spite of the large collection of germplasm and globally active genetic enhancement program. knowledge and management of the genetic diversity are critical for any crop improvement programs. past efforts led to believe that low molecular variation exists in cultivated chickpea; however, this conclusion is based on limited number of germplasm and markers involved in these studies. with the discovery of large numbers of genomic ssr markers, it is now possible to conduct extensive molecular diversity in chickpea for identifying genetically diverse germplasm with beneficial traits for use in crop improvement programs  <cit> . towards this end, a composite collection of  <dig> accessions  <cit>  has been developed, sampling wide geographical and biological diversity from over  <dig>  chickpea accessions conserved in genebanks in icrisat and icarda, the two cgiar centers having chickpea improvement programs. in this study, we have molecularly profiled this composite collection using  <dig> ssr markers. this is the largest and most extensive molecular dataset generated in chickpea, which detected  <dig> alleles with high gene diversity, and large number of rare, common, and unique alleles. this study also detected a highly significant  positive correlation between alleles per locus and gene diversity, allele size with alleles per locus and gene diversity, and common and rare alleles with allele size, alleles per locus and gene diversity. however, variable and inconsistent relationship between the number of repeat unit length and ssr polymorphism has been reported in several legumes including chickpea  <cit> . information available on these alleles present in different germplasm lines will be very useful for developing the mapping populations for genome analysis as well as in applied breeding programmes.

molecular-based biological and geographical diversity differed with respect to allelic richness, frequency of rare alleles, the common and most frequent alleles, and group-specific unique alleles. the differences in sample size of the germplasm included in each group may partially explain these differences. however, we also detected differences in mean molecular weight for the amplified fragments  produced by different groups. for example, the average allele-size range of the desi types  was greater by  <dig>  bp than kabuli types ; pea-shaped allele-size range  lower by  <dig>  bp from desi and by  <dig>  bp from kabuli types; the mediterranean and ssea accessions had similar average allele-size range  while african accessions showed much reduced allele size range  that differ by 32– <dig> bp from those of mediterranean, ssea, and wa region accessions . the reduced allele size range observed in pea-shaped types or with those from african accessions could probably be due to founder effects  associated with chickpea evolution and domestication  <cit> , ssr evolution  <cit> , or dilution of genetic variation as the pea-shaped most probably originated as a result of introgression between desi and kabuli types.

reduced marker polymorphisms, as measured by differences in pic values between groups of accessions, were detected in the reference set in comparison with composite collection. however, few markers in desi, kabuli, and pea-shaped among biological types and africa and mediterranean region accessions among geographical types were more polymorphic in the reference set than in composite collection. both mediterranean and africa regions, respectively, are the center of origin  <cit>  and secondary center of diversity  <cit>  of chickpea, thus genetically more diverse than other region accessions. the highly polymorphic markers and genetically diverse germplasm with beneficial traits from the mediterranean and africa region accessions are probably the best source materials for use in chickpea genomics and breeding.

neighbour-joining tree broadly separated kabuli from desi types, with pea-shaped types dispersed in both the groups, and wild cicer accessions falling within kabuli types. however, c. echinospermum separated from c. reticulatum, though both belong to the primary gene pool and are cross compatible with c. arietinum . a reference set of  <dig> most diverse accessions has been formed that captured  <dig>  of the  <dig> alleles, representing diversity from the entire spectrum of composite collection. from preliminary evaluation of this reference set for various agronomic traits at patancheru, india, a number of accessions with beneficial traits were identified:  <dig> tolerant to drought,  <dig> to salinity,  <dig> to pod borer,  <dig> to dry root rot,  <dig> to fusarium wilt, and  <dig> to ascohcyhta blight, while  <dig> to  <dig> accessions each with variation in early maturity, large-seed size, high seed yield and high protein content . this reference set is therefore a useful resource for identifying diverse lines for use in functional and comparative genomics, in mapping and cloning gene, and in applied plant breeding for enhancing the genetic potential of chickpea. further work is in progress at icrisat to add more number of markers and phenotype to this reference set for agronomic traits including drought, salinity and high temperature tolerance. limited seed stock of this reference set is available upon request to researchers after signing standard material transfer agreement .

CONCLUSIONS
crop improvement depends on the existence of genetic diversity. we report here the largest ever study undertaken in chickpea to characterize genetic structure and allelic diversity, using ssr  in high throughput assay , in composite collection , and formation of a genotype-based reference set . this reference set captured  <dig> of the  <dig>  alleles, representing diversity from all direction of the neighbour-joining tree diagram, of the composite collection. it is a useful resource for allele mining, association genetics, mapping and cloning of gene, and in applied breeding to broaden the genetic base of chickpea.
