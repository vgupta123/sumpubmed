BACKGROUND
gene duplication has been an ongoing process during eukaryotic evolution that has provided genetic raw material for the evolution of new gene functions that can lead to morphological and physiological novelty. duplicated genes can undergo sequence divergence caused by positive selection or neutral drift  <cit>  and divergence in expression patterns and function. two common fates of retained duplicated genes are neofunctionalization – gain of a new function or expression pattern by one copy  <cit>  and subfunctionalization – partitioning of ancestral function or expression pattern between both copies  <cit> . plant genomes contain large numbers of duplicated genes, derived by polyploidy, segmental duplications, tandem duplications, and retroposition of cdnas. many duplicated genes in plant genomes have been preserved and undergone purifying selection, a few have undergone positive selection and functional diversification, and some have experienced subfunctionalization  <cit> .

there are three genes that code for organellar ribosomal s <dig> genes among rosid species. analysis of rps <dig> genes in the rosid species arabidopsis thaliana, cotton , and soybean  revealed the presence of two expressed copies of rps <dig> in the nucleus that were derived by gene duplication  <cit> . both in vitro and in vivo rps <dig> protein import experiments indicated that one copy encodes the chloroplast-imported protein  while the other encodes mitochondria-imported rps <dig>   <cit> . it was inferred that the missing mt rps <dig> gene product has been functionally replaced by the product of numit rps <dig> in a common ancestor of arabidopsis, cotton, and legumes. thus the function of numit rps <dig> has been modified after gene duplication, and one could argue that numit rps <dig> has gained a new function because it is operating in a new cellular context . subsequently mt rps <dig> was lost from mitochondrial dna many times during the evolutionary history of rosids, as inferred from a southern blot hybridization survey  <cit> . surprisingly, however, there were many species of rosids that do appear to retain rps <dig> in the mitochondrion, based on southern blot hybridizations, but the gene in some species may not be intact or functional.

the organellar rps <dig> genes in rosids provide an intriguing system to study gene duplication because the subcellular location and site of action of numit rps <dig> has changed after gene duplication from the chloroplast to the mitochondrion. we have studied sequence evolution of numit rps <dig> among rosids to determine what kinds of amino acid changes have taken place and where those amino acids are located in the tertiary structure, as well as to test the hypothesis that there has been adaptive evolution. also we have examined the divergence of expression patterns between numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig>  after finding intact and expressed numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> genes in malus we tested the hypothesis that there has been expression partitioning of the two genes in different organ types and/or stress conditions to preserve both genes.

RESULTS
identification of numit rps <dig> in malus, populus, and citrus and phylogenetic analysis
to study the evolution of numit rps <dig> sequences in the rosids, we identified sequences homologous to numit rps <dig> in malus, populus, and citrus by blast searches of the ncbi expressed sequence tag  database using the numit rps <dig> from arabidopsis as a query. ests  were aligned and the open reading frames were identified. the genes in each species are predicted with high probability to encode mitochondrial proteins by four prediction programs: mitoprot  <cit> , targetp v <dig>   <cit> , predotar v <dig>   <cit> , and ipsort  <cit> . three of the four programs discriminate mitochondrial from chloroplast proteins and no support was obtained for chloroplast targeting. alignment of the n-termini with mitochondrial targeting presequences from numit rps <dig> in other rosid species shows sequence conservation and indicates that they are homologous genes . because numit rps <dig> in arabidopsis, gossypium, and glycine have been experimentally shown to be imported into mitochondria but not chloroplasts , we infer that the products from the homologous genes in malus, populus, and citrus also are targeted to mitochondria. we found numit rps <dig> sequences only in species belonging to the rosid lineage, suggesting that the gene duplication event that created numit rps <dig> likely occurred after the emergence of the rosid lineage. we did not find a numit rps <dig> sequence in vitis, a group at the base of rosids  <cit> , despite the mostly sequenced genome  <cit>  and a large est collection available at ncbi. we infer that the gene duplication event occurred at the base of the eurosids after separation from the vitaceae lineage .

nucp rps <dig> sequences from seven rosid species were obtained from genbank by blast searches using the previously characterized nucp rps <dig> from arabidopsis  <cit>  and aligned with the numit rps <dig> sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the sequences verified the orthologous relationships of numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> sequences . the phylogenetic relationships inferred from nucp rps <dig> and numit rps <dig>  however, did not follow established relationships of rosid species  <cit> . for numit rps <dig>  the positions of populus and gossypium in the tree are switched; for nucp rps <dig> the gene positions in the tree are completely scrambled. the lack of congruence between the gene trees and organismal phylogeny is probably due to the short sequences being analyzed . alternatively, it might be caused by the complex history of multiple polyploidy events and subsequent loss of duplicated genes during rosid evolution. for example, after polyploidization the lineage containing legumes and malus might have retained copy  <dig> while arabidopsis, citrus, gossypium and populus retained copy  <dig> . comparisons of branch lengths showed that numit rps <dig> sequences have diverged rapidly with much longer branch lengths than the nucp rps <dig> sequences, suggesting there has been accelerated evolution of numit rps <dig> in each lineage, and consistent with results from adams et al.  <cit>  that included fewer species of rosids.

accelerated nucleotide substitution rates and positive selection on numit rps13
to better quantify the rate increase and to determine if both ka and ks  are accelerated in numit rps <dig> sequences, the ka, ks values, and ka/ks ratios were compared between nucp rps <dig> and numit rps <dig> in the rosids. significantly higher ka values and ka/ks ratios were observed in the numit rps <dig> genes than in the nucp rps <dig> genes . the ka values in the numit rps <dig> genes were 3– <dig> times greater than in the nucp rps <dig> genes. no significant difference in ks values, however, was found between the nucp rps <dig> and numit rps <dig> copies . these results show that numit rps <dig> has been experiencing a considerably accelerated rate of non-synonymous substitutions compared with the nucp rps <dig> in all seven lineages of rosids.

athe mean and standard deviation are shown in parentheses.

although simple pair-wise comparison of ka and ks analysis provides some insights into the accelerated amino acid substitution in numit rps <dig>  branchwise estimation of ka, ks values, and ka/ks ratios can provide additional information such as positive selection and adaptive molecular evolution along certain branches and clades  <cit> . to detect if there has been positive selection acting on numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> in different rosid species, site specific model analysis was conducted using paml  <cit> .  both the rps <dig> tree  and the species tree that reflects our current understanding of rosid phylogeny  <cit>  were used for detection of positive selection to determine if the tree topology influenced detection of positively selected sites, and no differences were found in this regard.

one ratio model  shows that the ka/ks ratio of numit rps <dig> is about  <dig> times higher than nucp rps <dig> , congruent with observations from simple ka and ks analysis. for each dataset, likelihood ratio tests  for detection of positive selection were examined using m7-m <dig> and m8a-m <dig> comparisons. for numit rps <dig>  m <dig> is significantly better than m <dig> and m8a in numit rps <dig>  and  <dig> % of sites are inferred to undergo positive selection , suggesting there has been positive selection acting on numit rps <dig>  in addition, based on bayes empirical bayes  analysis, two codon sites in numit rps <dig> were identified as showing strong positive selection . however, there is no evidence for sites under positive selection in nucp rps <dig>  in nucp rps <dig>  m <dig> is not significantly better than m <dig> and m8a . these results indicate that strong positive selection acts on the evolution of numit rps13among the rosid species, particularly at codons  <dig> and  <dig>

structural location of positively selected amino acids
relative locations of the two positively selected sites were plotted on the tertiary amino acid structures of rps <dig> from escherichia coli and thermus thermophilus  to infer approximate locations in numit rps <dig>  except for the c-terminal end which is longer and contains one more α-helix structure in t. thermophilus, the overall structure of rps <dig> from e. coli and t. thermophilus are relatively similar . rps <dig> residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in e. coli  correspond to the positively selected sites in numit rps <dig> based on the amino acid alignment . previous structural and functional studies of thermus rps <dig> showed that there are two structurally important regions where rps <dig> interacts with the 16s rrna  <cit> . one of them is the loop region between helix  <dig> and turn  <dig>   <cit> . one of the positively selected residues found in our analysis is close to that region. the second positively selected residue in numit rps <dig> is located in the highly basic cooh-terminal extended region . this region is virtually devoid of secondary structure and found to interact with the 16s rrna at the p-site and a-site   <cit> . positively selected sites in or near regions that interact with the 16s rrna suggest that there has been functional refinement of numit rps <dig> to interact better with the 16s rrna.

amino acid changes in numit rps <dig> that increase identity to mt rps13
because numit rps <dig> was derived from nucp rps <dig> and encodes a rps <dig> protein that functions in the mitochondria, we were interested in determining if the numit rps <dig> has become more like the mt rps <dig> amino acid sequence. we determined if there have been mutations in the numit rps <dig> genes in any of the seven rosid species that change an amino acid to the residue that is present in mt rps <dig>  in our alignment of nucp rps <dig>  numit rps <dig>  and mt rps <dig> across different plant species, sixteen sites were identified where numit rps <dig> in one or more species has the same amino acid at the corresponding site in mt rps <dig> from seven angiosperms, and the amino acid is different from the amino acid present in nucp rps <dig> . the sixteen sites are relatively evenly distributed in the rps <dig> tertiary structure . although little is known about the exact functions of those regions, some of the mutations might help improve the function of numit rps <dig> in the mitochondrial ribosome. we plotted the sixteen amino acid changes on the phylogeny of the seven rosid species to infer when they might have occurred . mutations are inferred to have occurred along most of the branches, suggesting continuous refinement of the numit rps <dig> sequence. we infer that three mutations occurred in the common ancestor of all the species, with a subsequent mutation at site  <dig> in arabidopsis from d to e  and at site  <dig> in gossypium from a to s, although scenarios with multiple recent mutations cannot be ruled out.

expression evolution of numit rps13
having studied sequence evolution of numit rps <dig> we next tested the hypothesis that there have been changes in expression patterns and levels of expression of numit rps <dig> relative to nucp rps <dig>  extensive microarray data are available for arabidopsis thaliana including a single study that examined expression in  <dig> organs and developmental stages using the ath <dig> array  <cit> . we analyzed expression data for numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> using an anova approach . nucp rps <dig> is expressed a higher level than numit rps <dig> in most organs . notable exceptions were roots, senescing leaves and pollen where numit rps <dig> is more highly expressed . when comparing expression levels of the two genes among organs, sometimes the levels of both genes go up or down together, but sometimes the levels go in opposite directions. overall the organ-specific expression patterns between the two genes show both similarities and differences , depending on the organs compared.

to compare expression patterns of numit rps <dig> to other nuclear encoded ribosomal protein genes, we analyzed expression data for three other nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes: rps <dig>  rps <dig>  and rps <dig>  <cit> . the expression levels and patterns of all four genes were highly similar , although rps <dig> expression levels were lower in some organs . thus numit rps <dig> has evolved an expression pattern similar to that of other nuclear-encoded genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and its expression has diverged from that of nucp rps <dig> 

malus contains an expressed and rna-edited copy of rps <dig> in the mitochondrion
having studied the sequence and expression evolution of numit rps <dig> we next consider the fate of mt rps <dig> in rosids. a large number of rosids, including arabidopsis, gossypium, glycine, and citrus have lost mt rps <dig>  as judged by dna gel blot hybridization  <cit>  , but some rosids retain rps <dig> in mitochondrial dna. we identified a transcribed copy of rps <dig> in malus domestica  from blast searches of the ncbi est database that is 90–92% identical with the rps <dig> gene in the mitochondrion of several eudicots. the sequence was derived from a study of ests in malus  <cit> . a similar gene  was found in prunus persica, another member of the rosaceae family. we evaluated the rps <dig> sequence from malus for sites of c-to-u rna editing by pcr amplifying and sequencing rps <dig> from genomic dna and comparing the gdna sequence to the est sequences. c-to-u rna editing plays an important role in the expression of plant mitochondrial genes to restore certain amino acids to those that are evolutionarily conserved  <cit> . among angiosperm rps <dig> genes, nine possible edited sites have been identified . four of those sites are already t's instead of c's in the genomic dna sequence of mt rps <dig> from malus, and thus rna editing might be expected at five sites in the malus cdnas. no editing was observed in the two ests from malus, and the est from prunus had editing at only one site . to verify the lack of rna editing, we amplified and directly sequenced mt rps <dig> cdnas from leaves and petals of malus. unexpectedly five rna editing sites were discovered in both leaves and petals at five sites . after transcription, rna editing converts codons from serine to leucine  and from arginine to cysteine . the changes made by rna editing would restore an evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence and make the resulting protein likely to be functional, should the transcripts be translated.

co-expression of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in  <dig> different organ types and under five different stress conditions
we conducted expression assays of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig>  and rna editing examination of mt rps <dig>  in malus to test the hypothesis that expression patterns have been partitioned between the two genes in different organ types. rt-pcr was performed with  or without  reverse transcriptase to check for dna contamination . transcripts of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> were observed in roots , stems, stigmas + styles, and ovaries. transcripts of these two genes were also observed in  <dig> additional organ types: hypocotyls, cotyledons, young leaves , mature leaves, peduncles, petals, seeds, sepals, stamens, and young fruit. mt rps <dig> cdnas were sequenced from each organ type to determine if any sites were edited. different organ types in apple all showed the five rna editing sites mentioned above. the results of the rt-pcr experiments show that both copies are co-expressed in all examined organ types.

although both copies of rps <dig> are expressed in many organ types it is possible that there might be partitioning of expression between the two genes under stress conditions. we tested the hypothesis by examining the expression patterns of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> under five different stresses including cold, dark, heat, salt, and water submersion treatments to determine if expression partitioning occurs under different environmental stresses. apple seedlings were independently subjected to each of these five stresses . four organ types, including roots, hypocotyls, cotyledons, and leaves were examined for expression of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig>  based on rt-pcr results, transcripts of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> were observed under each of the five stress conditions: cold, dark, heat, salt, and water submersion treatments. sequencing of rt-pcr products showed that the transcripts were rna edited at  <dig> sites, although in some cases there was partial editing at one or more sites.

we have shown transcription of both numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in many organs and under several stress conditions. however it is possible that transcripts from one gene might be present at low levels. pcr of cdna template  is not a quantitative technique and low levels of transcripts might not be distinguishable from high levels. to determine if abundant levels of steady-state transcripts are derived from both genes, we used real-time pcr  to assay transcript levels of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig>  we compared levels of numit rps <dig> to those of another nuclear gene for a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, rps <dig> , and we compared levels of mt rps <dig> to those of another mitochondrial gene, cob . we assayed expression levels in a subset of  <dig> organs and two stress conditions that were assayed above. numit rps <dig> transcripts were present at or above the levels of rps <dig> in ovaries and roots, and most organs showed at least half as many transcripts from numit rps <dig> as rps <dig> . cold stress was an exception, where the numit rps13/rps <dig> ratios were less than  <dig>  . mt rps <dig> transcripts were present at slightly over twice the levels of cob transcripts in leaves . the mt rps13/cob transcript ratio was above  <dig>  in most other organs and under cold stress. overall there is evidence for relatively high levels of steady-state transcripts from numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in most organs.

purifying selection acting on numit rps <dig>  nucp rps <dig>  and mt rps <dig> in malus
detecting purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection on each of the three rps <dig> genes would provide insights into the selective forces at work and could indicate if one copy is a pseudogene. a ka/ks ratio less than one would indicate purifying selection and be evidence for a functional gene, and a ka/ks ratio of about one would be evidence of neutral evolution and thus probably pseudogenization. the branch specific model in paml was used to detect adaptive molecular evolution in numit rps <dig>  nucp rps <dig>  and mt rps <dig> for the malus branches by comparing with other plant species. for each lrt, m <dig> is the model assuming neutral evolution among sites, matest <dig> assumes that there are positively selected amino acid sites for the foreground lineage, and matest <dig>  is used to test if the detection of positive selection is an artifact. lrts showed that matest <dig> is not significantly better than m <dig> and matest <dig> in malus numit rps <dig> and malus mt rps <dig>  indicating that there is no positive selection for these two branches . for nucp rps <dig>  matest <dig> is significantly better than m <dig>  but not better than matest <dig> , suggesting that there is no positive selection in nucp rps <dig>  in addition, branch specific models can provide detailed information about how many sites are undergoing purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection. for numit rps <dig>  65% of the sites are under purifying selection with ka/ks less than one, 28% of sites are under neutral evolution with ka/ks close to one, and 7% of sites are under positive selection with ka/ks greater than one  without statistical support by lrts. for nucp rps <dig>  90% of sites are under purifying selection, 7% of sites are under neutral selection, and 3% of sites are under positive selection  although the positively selected sites are not supported by lrts. for mt rps <dig>  66% of sites are under purifying selection and 34% of sites are under neutral selection . the number of sites experiencing each type of selection in numit rps <dig> in malus is similar to numit rps <dig> in other rosids that do not have mt rps <dig> . overall our results reveal that the three ribosomal protein s <dig> genes in malus are undergoing higher purifying selection than neutral evolution, suggesting that their functionality is maintained by purifying selection.

discussion
continuous accelerated evolution and molecular adaptation of numit rps <dig> among rosids
after gene duplication some retained duplicated genes undergo asymmetric rate divergence and the faster evolving copy experiences relaxed constraint or positive selection  <cit> . the increased ka rate, ka/ks ratio, and positively selected sites detected in numit rps <dig>  compared with nucp rps <dig>  across different rosid species show there has been accelerated sequence evolution of numit rps <dig>  the increased ka rate is likely to be correlated with the modified function of numit rps <dig> – from encoding a chloroplast ribosomal protein to a mitochondrial ribosomal protein. some amino acid sequence changes were probably necessary for numit rps <dig> to interact well with other proteins in the mitochondrial ribosome. the increased rate of non-synonymous substitutions is a continuing process instead of there being a burst of sequence change upon formation of numit rps <dig> followed by a prolonged period of lower rates of non-synonymous substitutions. the continued higher ka rate, and the two positively selected codons in numit rps <dig> near the positions where rps <dig> interacts with 16s rna domain, show that the sequence, and suggest that the function, of numit rps <dig> in mitochondria is continuing to be refined. site-specific positive selection has been detected in other duplicated genes  <cit> . for example, in duplicated ap <dig> and pi genes there has been functional diversification driven by positive selection acting on different sites within a functional domain involved in heterodimerization  <cit> .

the sixteen amino acids in one or more rosid species that have changed to the amino acid present in mt rps <dig>  indicate that numit rps <dig> is becoming more like mt rps <dig>  we propose that this is a type of convergent sequence evolution of numit rps <dig> that possibly improves the function of numit rps <dig> in the ribosome. the amino acid changes appear to have been taking place continuously during rosid evolution , with the largest number  having occurred on the branch leading to the legumes glycine and medicago. we speculate that some of the amino acid changes that have taken place along the terminal or subterminal branches of the tree might have allowed numit rps <dig> to be selected for, over mt rps <dig>  and allowed multiple independent losses of mt rps <dig> in different lineages . in species where mt rps <dig> has been lost the product of numit rps <dig> presumably functions as well as, or perhaps better than, mt rps <dig> or else there would have been selection for retention of mt rps <dig>  overall the adaptive and convergent evolutionary forces that seem to be acting on numit rps <dig> have continued during rosid evolution instead of being factors only soon after gene duplication in a common ancestor of most rosids.

expression evolution of numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> in arabidopsis
expression patterns of some duplicated genes have been shown to evolve in a divergent and sometimes asymmetric manner  <cit> . for example, many of the genes derived by an ancient polyploidy event in the arabidopsis lineage have undergone considerable expression divergence  <cit> , some of which may have been asymmetric between the two duplicates. considering that numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> show asymmetric divergence in sequence, and different subcellular locations of their protein products, we predicted that they also would show asymmetric divergence in expression, with the expression pattern of numit rps <dig> being similar to that of other nuclear-encoded genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> did show some differences in expression patterns although the differences were only dramatic in roots, senescing leaves, and pollen. numit rps <dig> has evolved a similar expression pattern to three other genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, perhaps by gaining regulatory elements from another gene for a mitochondrial protein, as have several mitochondrial genes that have been transferred to the nucleus  <cit> . alternatively there may have been mutations in the regulatory elements of numit rps <dig> soon after gene duplication that produced an expression pattern similar to that of other genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. considering that numit rps <dig> was formed in a common ancestor of most rosids, distinguishing between the above possibilities about the origin of its regulatory elements is impossible. overall numit rps <dig> and nucp rps <dig> add to the growing number of duplicated genes reported in arabidopsis thaliana that have experienced divergence in expression patterns.

co-expression of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in malus
we have shown that numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in malus are both transcribed in  <dig> different organ types and under five abiotic stress conditions, mt rps <dig> is rna edited at sites to make the transcripts contain an evolutionarily conserved sequence, and abundant steady-state transcripts from both genes are present in a variety of organs. both genes are experiencing purifying selection. taken together, the data obtained in this study indicate that it is likely that both numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in malus are functional genes and not pseudogenes. however there is the possibility, albeit unlikely, that transcripts from one gene  might not be translated. even if both proteins are present, there is the possibility that only one is assembled into mitochondrial ribosomes, and that process could vary among organs and environmental conditions. showing that both numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> proteins are assembled into mitochondrial ribosomes, especially in a variety of organ types and under various environmental conditions, is beyond the scope of the current evolutionary study.

although we have provided evidence for the functionality of the gene products from numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in malus, might numit rps <dig> have experienced functional reversion to encode a chloroplast protein? several lines of evidence do not support that possibility. the mitochondrial targeting presequence of numit rps <dig> is similar to those of numit rps <dig> in arabidopsis, gossypium, and glycine , each of which was experimentally determined to be imported into mitochondria but not chloroplasts  <cit> . numit rps <dig> in malus does not have a greatly accelerated rate of sequence evolution or show more sites under positive selection, compared with numit rps <dig> in other rosids, as might be expected if its product now functions in the chloroplast. instead purifying selection is operating on numit rps <dig> in malus. finally, there is no evidence to suggest that nucp rps <dig> in malus is a pseudogene and indeed the gene is experiencing strong purifying selection.

co-expression of numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> genes in malus contrasts with the atp <dig> genes in neurospora crassa where the nuclear and mitochondrial copies are expressed during different stages of the life cycle  <cit>  and expression has been partitioned between the two genes. presumably the nuclear copy of atp <dig> was derived from transfer of the mitochondrial gene to the nucleus in an ancestor of neurospora, and the current availability of several ascomycete genome sequences could shed light on the evolutionary timing of the gene transfer. only three other cases of co-expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes have been reported, to our knowledge, including cox <dig> genes in multiple legume species within the phaseoleae tribe  <cit> , rpl <dig> genes in wheat   <cit> , and sdh <dig> genes in populus  <cit> . those genes contrast to rps <dig> in rosids because the nuclear copies were derived by transfer of the mitochondrial gene to the nucleus.

considering that numit rps <dig> was created by gene duplication in the common ancestor of most rosids, co-expression of mt rps <dig> and numit rps <dig> in malus has presumably occurred for a long period of evolutionary time. other cases of co-expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in plants represent evolutionarily recent gene transfers to the nucleus. indeed following transfer of a mitochondrial gene to the nucleus the mitochondrial copy is often lost in a relatively short amount of time  <cit> . thus it was unexpected that numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> have been preserved without partitioning of expression patterns. why would both copies continue to be retained and expressed? one possibility is that there is partitioning of expression in organs, tissues, or cell types, or under environmental conditions that were not examined in this study. another possibility is that, despite the considerable level of sequence divergence between numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> , the product of either gene functions well in the mitochondrial ribosomes of malus. that possibility is supported by the fact that some rosids  have only the numit rps <dig> and non-rosid angiosperms have only mt rps <dig>  another possibility is that mutations have not occurred in numit rps <dig> from malus that cause it to be selected for over mt rps <dig>  as presumably occurred in other lineages of rosids that have lost mt rps <dig>  in this regard it is notable that there are no amino acid changes in numit rps <dig> to the residue present in mt rps <dig> that occurred along the terminal branch leading to malus , unlike all of the other terminal branches on the tree leading to species that have lost mt rps <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the accelerated rate of amino acid evolution, positive selection on specific sites, and amino acid changes to the residue present in mt rps <dig> provide evidence that numit rps <dig> genes in rosids have experienced adaptive evolution and convergent sequence evolution with mt rps <dig>  numit rps <dig> provides an example of a gene that has experienced site-specific positive selection while the gene as a whole has been under purifying selection. expression patterns of numit rps <dig> have diverged to become similar to those of other genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. malus contains intact genes for both numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> that are transcribed in a range of organs and under several abiotic stresses. abundant levels of steady state transcripts from both numit rps <dig> and mt rps <dig> in malus in a variety of organ types, as well as purifying selection acting on both genes, suggest that both genes are functional and not pseudogenes. the three organellar rps <dig> genes in rosids provide a distinctive case of gene duplication involving the co-evolution of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes.
