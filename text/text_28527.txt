BACKGROUND
genomic structural variation is an important and abundant source of genetic and phenotypic variation  <cit> . as a key type of genomic structural variation, copy number variant  is operationally defined as a dna segment longer than 50 bp that is found in variable numbers relative to that found in a reference genome  <cit> . the different types of cnvs—duplications, deletions, insertions  <cit> —have different effects, which include changes in levels of gene expression, disruption of gene dosage, and loss of regulatory elements  <cit> .

array comparative genomic hybridization  is an efficient and reliable method for analyzing changes in dna copy number losses and gains. since its invention in  <dig>  <cit>  and first used to examine dna copy number in  <dig>  <cit> , acgh technology has become an essential tool for identifying cnvs  <cit> . since  <dig>  when two groups reported genome-wide analysis of human cnvs  <cit>  and completion of a comprehensive human cnv map in  <dig>  <cit> , much of the attention focused on cnv research had been devoted to understanding human disease. nonetheless, in addition to the large number of cnvs discovered in humans  <cit> , considerable structural polymorphism had also been found for mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , macaque  <cit>  and several domesticated animal genomes, including those of dogs  <cit> , pigs  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , chickens  <cit> , and horses  <cit> .

besides chickens, cnvs had been detected in other avian genomes, such as those of turkeys  <cit>  and ducks  <cit> . some commercial chicken breeds as cobb broiler, white leghorn and also chinese dou had been reported for their cnv loci yet  <cit> . herein, we reported the use of a genome-wide 400 k acgh platform with custom-designed probes to map common cnvs in the genomes of  <dig> locally raised chinese chicken breeds, besides the data of cobb broiler, white leghorn and chinese dou, which had been reported previously under the same platform and reference sample  <cit> . we discussed the value of further cataloguing large amounts of such variations, some of which were likely to underlie breed-specific biology.

RESULTS
distribution of cnv loci and cnvrs in eleven chicken breeds
the  <dig> chicken breeds  used in this study were the silkie , tibet , chahua, bearded , jinhu , anak , beijing fatty , langshan , qingyuan partridge , shek-ki , and wenchang  varieties. ten of these breeds originated in china, which has historically demonstrated extraordinary success in breeding disease-resistant chickens able to adapt to environmental changes . the ak variety was included as it represents several broiler chickens imported from israel and was used in the breeding of the huangyu variety, which is currently the fastest-growing domestic chicken breed in china. the genome of a female chinese dehong chicken, which was undomesticated in south of china was used as the reference for the acgh experiment. the two animals in each breed were chosen randomly in their population. all the  <dig> chicken breeds belonged to preserved populations which were kept by our collaborator. and all the typical phenotypes for each breed were stable after breeding for several generations. two individuals  were chosen in order to represent the typical breed and also to get rid of the gender-specific bias in our analysis as previous studies  <cit> . we used a high-throughput agilent 2 × 400 k array cgh platform with custom-designed probes and excluded the sex chromosomes  from our analysis to avoid gender-related analysis regarding global cnv regions. cnvs discovered from uncertain chromosomes  and linkage groups that did not assigned to typical chromosomal loci  were also removed from the analysis. the rest array data used for further analysis were specific for chicken autosomes gga 1– <dig> and gga  <dig> to identify a total of  <dig> cnvs in the  <dig> chicken breeds . the mean and median lengths of the cnvs were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. the lengths of the cnvs ranged from  <dig>  kb to 2 mb. within these segments,  <dig> cnvs involved an increase in dna sequence, whereas  <dig> involved a decrease in dna sequence. the total number of cnvs detected for each breed was  <dig> in wj,  <dig> in zj,  <dig> in ch,  <dig> in hx,  <dig> in jh,  <dig> in ak,  <dig> in by,  <dig> in ls,  <dig> in qy,  <dig> in sq, and  <dig> in wc . the average number of cnvs per breed was  <dig> in wj,  <dig> in zj,  <dig> in ch,  <dig> in hx,  <dig> in jh,  <dig> in ak,  <dig> in by,  <dig> in ls,  <dig> in qy,  <dig> in sq, and  <dig> in wc. all of these cnvs localized to different sets of cnvrs in the genomes of the different chicken breeds.

a total of  <dig> cnvrs were characterized. the mean and median sizes of the cnvrs were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. their lengths ranged from  <dig>  kb to 2 mb. the total number of cnvrs detected in each breed was  <dig> in wj,  <dig> in zj,  <dig> in ch,  <dig> in hx,  <dig> in jh,  <dig> in ak,  <dig> in by,  <dig> in ls,  <dig> in qy,  <dig> in sq, and  <dig> in wc. among these cnvrs,  <dig>  were present in a single individual,  <dig>  in two individuals,  <dig>  in three individuals,  <dig>  in four individuals, and  <dig>  in more than four individuals. whereas  <dig>  cnvrs involved a gain of dna,  <dig>  involved a loss of dna, and  <dig>  involved both gain and loss of dna . in terms of their locations within genes, 44% of the cnvrs localized to exons, 49% localized to intergenic regions, and only 7% localized to introns . and in chicken whole genome data , nearly 3% of the genome localized to exons, 60% localized to intergenic regions, and 37% localized to introns . it suggested that cnvrs were apt to happen in gene regions comparing with the whole genomic distribution.

cnv loci and cnvrs among different chicken breeds
duplicated and deleted cnv loci for the chicken genomes were classified according to their lengths . for all breeds, the majority of the cnvs were larger than 10 kb. this category of cnvs included 86% of the duplicated loci and 83% of the deleted loci . the relative numbers of the different cnvrs appeared to be distributed evenly within the autosomes of each breed, with the exception of chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  which did not contain any cnvrs . of the  <dig> autosomes that contained cnvrs, in all breeds, chr1–chr <dig>  chr <dig>  and chr <dig> contained cnvrs, whereas the other chromosomes of each breed did not always have a cnvr.

comparison of the cnvrs in the  <dig> breeds indicated that the average number of cnvrs shared among all the varieties was ~ <dig> , whereas the average number of variety-specific cnvrs was ~ <dig> . this means that the number of cnvrs found in each breed was approximately constant, whereas the variety-specific cnvrs differed in number . in each breed, the number of variety -specific cnvrs was mainly contributed by individual variations. compared with the other breeds studied, ls, qy, sq, and wc had substantially more cnvrs and variety-specific cnvrs. this may indicated that these four breeds were more closely related to each other than to the other breeds.

principal component analysis
to classify different clusters of breeds, we used whole-genome cgh log <dig> ratio data to perform principal component analysis . to complete this analysis, we included previously published data for cobb broiler , white leghorn , and chinese dou  chickens  <cit> . using the pca results, we could classify the  <dig> breeds  into roughly three categories. whereas wc, lc, sq, and qy clustered on the top left of figure  <dig>  the commercial a-hen division variety  was found on the top right, and the remaining local breeds and commercial strains of the c-cock division  clustered on the left of the bottom. in terms of regional distributions, the four varieties found on the top left of figure 5—the wc, ls, sq and qy varieties—all originated in the southern part of china. we proposed that the clustering of these four varieties reflected the admixture and inbreeding effects, and the influence of geographical proximity on the domestication process. as cb-f was a commercialized variety subjected to strong artificial selection pressure during its development, it was isolated from the other varieties in figure  <dig> 

agglomerative hierarchical clustering
to confirm the clustering patterns deduced by pca and attempt an independent strategy for hierarchical clustering of chicken breeds on the basis of their ancestries, we performed a cluster analysis  <cit>  for all individuals within each of the  <dig> breeds according to their absent or present cnvs. the cluster tree was shown in figure  <dig>  the approximate unbiased  p-value and bootstrap probability  value were shown for each node. given that the au p-value is less biased than the bp value, we focused on the au p-values. edge numbers, given beneath the nodes, represented the order in which the clusters were built. a smaller edge number indicated more closely related individuals. although not all of the individuals from each variety group together, the overall trends were consistent with the clustering achieved using pca, i.e.,wc, sq, qy, and ls were more closely. the separate of the intra-specific individuals may caused by the limit that a cnv locus must contain five probes at least in the statistical analysis, which excluded some variety-specific cnvs.

functional analysis of cnvrs
we applied the biomart webtool to the ensembl gallus gallus  database to retrieve genes associated with the observed cnvrs. a total of  <dig> ensembl genes were matched to  <dig> cnvrs . then, functional annotation and functional clustering analysis were performed for these genes  using the cnvrs to identify biological processes enriched for cnvs  <cit> . of  <dig> ensembl gene identifiers found using the david functional annotation tool,  <dig> had functional annotations. gene functional classification of the genes grouped  <dig> ensembl genes into  <dig> clusters and excluded  <dig> unrelated genes from the analysis . this indicated a wide distribution of cnvrs and reflected the inadequacy with which chicken genes had been annotated relative to other model mammalian species. the eight clusters corresponded to different categories in terms of the ontology of their molecular functions and biological processes, including structural components of the cytoskeleton, antigen processing and presentation, proteolysis involved in cellular protein catabolic processes, transition metal-ion binding, calcium-ion binding, g-protein-coupled receptor signaling, atp binding, and dna-dependent regulation of transcription. the gene clusters with the highest levels of significance were associated with structural components of the cytoskeleton  and antigen processing and presentation . to explore the basis of the distinct gene clustering in the groups comprising ls, qy, sq, and wc, and the other chinese local breeds, the david functional annotation tool was used again to analyze the cnvs of the two groups . the results clearly indicated that the group comprising ls, qy, sq, and wc had four more gene clusters than the group containing the other chinese locally raised breeds, which means ls, qy, sq, and wc were more closely related and uniform.

validation of cnvs by quantitative pcr
all real-time quantitative pcr  assays were designed to confirm the presence of the cnvs detected by acgh analysis. we chose to investigate  <dig> of the predicted cnvs in the qy and wj breeds using one primer set per locus, included two cnvs adjacent to functional genes and also twenty-two random selected cnvs. sixteen dna samples from the two chicken breeds , including the samples used in the acgh analysis, were used for qpcr of the  <dig> cnvs . then we got the same results between acgh and qpcr including  <dig> cnvs loci in sixteen individuals, which strongly supported our results that got from cgh arrays. pcca, which encodes propionyl-coenzyme a carboxylase and was previously identified as a non-cnv locus, was used as the reference gene. our findings confirmed the stability of pcca in the chicken genome and its suitability as a reference gene to normalize sample amounts in different breeds. most of the qpcr and acgh results were concordant based on the detection in the same sample . f-test were performed to check for homogeneity of variances between copy number of selected cnv loci and that of the reference ppca locus at the first step. if the variances were statistically homogeneous, the paired t-test was performed in the next step in order to check if the test samples showed significant mean difference comparing with the reference locus. as a result of that,  <dig> sets for f-test showed greater variance than references locus . and for the rest  <dig> sets tested by paired t-test, results indicated that they all showed the significant difference  except one. our results suggested that most of the test loci were truly cnvs. and for the chr2: 130453299– <dig> locus, it was detected and verified only in one sample of the qingyuan partridge breed, which displayed rare cnv .

our acgh analysis identified some interesting loci. one of the cnv loci locates on chr <dig> , which contains the gene that encodes the mhc class i antigen  . the gene, which is transcribed at a high level and is polymorphic, was duplicated in all of the breeds we studied, except for wc, in which it was deleted. mature epitope-tagged yfv, which is associated with ®2-microglobulin, is located at the surfaces of chicken b  lymphoma cells  <cit> . cnvs occur predominantly in genes encoding components of the immune systems of birds  <cit> , and mammals, such as humans  <cit>  and holstein cattle  <cit> . this trend was confirmed by our finding that the genes on chr <dig> of chicken, which encode components of the immune system, contained cnvs found universally in various breeds of chickens.

the other specific duplication of a cnvr occurred on chr <dig> at positions  <dig> ,139– <dig> ,289 bp and  <dig> ,937– <dig> ,137 bp . the distance between the loci was  <dig>  kb. the first region was associated with dermal hyperpigmentation in chickens  <cit>  and contained four annotated functional genes, encoding endothelin  <dig> , the atp synthase epsilon subunit , the slowmo homolog  <dig> , and beta- <dig> tubulin . edn <dig> promoted melanoblast proliferation in chicken  <cit>  as seen following ectopic expression of an edn <dig> transgene in mouse  <cit> . the three other aforementioned genes may also contributed to dermal hyperpigmentation or phenotypes associated with dermal hyperpigmentation. the second duplicated region did not contain any known coding or regulatory elements. we provided compelling evidence consistent with the conclusion reported by dorshorst  <cit>  and shinomiya  <cit>  that a complex genomic rearrangement  on chr <dig> involving the edn <dig> locus caused the hyperpigmentation associated with fibromelanosis in the chicken. the genetic causative mutation of fibromelanosis was an inverted duplicated and junction of two genomic regions separated by 417 kb in wild-types. one duplicated regions contained edn <dig>  the expression level of which gene was increased during embryo developmental stages in silkie and also maintained a highly expressed level especially in adult skin  <cit> . furthermore, given that wj and jh were the only two breeds with this cnvr, we concluded that the dermal hyperpigmentation of these two chinese local chicken breeds was also caused by the copy number variation of this cnvr. on the other hand, wj and jh were closely distributed in the southeast of china. so it could be supposed that these two breeds originated from the same place or it might also be due to the trait being purposely bred into different strains.

we also found one other breed specific cnvr in ak, two in ch, three in wj, three in sq, three in ls, two in qy, two in wc, three in by, and three in hx. to associate cnvrs with specific phenotypes, the genes in the intra-specific cnvrs of by and hx were selected for further analysis. there were two genes in the three cnvrs of by. one of these genes encoded the mitochondrial ribosomal protein l <dig>   <cit> , and the other encoded the homologous homo sapiens solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig> protein   <cit> . neither of them appeared to be closely associated with macroscopic features of by, such as feathered feet.

in hx, five genes appeared in the three hx breed specific cnvrs. the cnvr on chr <dig> between positions  <dig> ,354 bp and  <dig> ,835 bp contained no genes, and between them, two cnvrs on chr <dig>  had five genes. among them, the gene that encoded keratin  <dig>  attracted our attention, owing to the participation of the keratin family in development of the hair follicle and epithelium  <cit> . it seemed possible that duplication of krt <dig> may  account for the bearded phenotype of hx chickens, although further work is necessary to evaluate this speculation.

CONCLUSIONS
this was the first study to investigate the cnvs in locally raised chinese chicken varieties by using customized cgh array. it described the distribution of cnvs and compared the differences in the cnvrs of the  <dig> chicken breeds. our results supplemented the information available for chicken cnvs and provided the first insights into how chicken breeds cluster on the basis of cnvs, which will be valuable for elucidating the relationship between cnvrs and regulatory mechanism of chicken functional genes.
