BACKGROUND
insulin is essential in maintaining normal blood glucose levels and is produced and secreted by the beta cells of pancreas in response to increased blood glucose levels. defects in insulin production and secretion, as observed in type  <dig> diabetes due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, result in chronic hyperglycemia, which is responsible for most of the secondary complications associated with diabetes. besides insulin injections, the only other option for treatment of type  <dig> diabetes is islet transplantation. because of the lack of insulin production, gene therapy using surrogate beta cells is a potential approach in the treatment of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . delivery of insulin by gene therapy represents an attractive alternative to protein replacement therapy by potentially providing a more convenient and cost-effective delivery strategy.

successful therapy for type  <dig> diabetes requires that mature insulin be produced and secreted from surrogate beta-cells in a glucose-regulated manner. liver appears to be an excellent surrogate organ for production of insulin, because it contains a glucose sensing machinery that is similar to pancreatic beta cells  <cit> . liver and pancreatic beta cells both express glut- <dig> and glucokinase  <cit> . moreover, viral gene transfer into hepatocytes is very efficient and the liver is also capable of mediating the production and release of therapeutic proteins into the systemic circulation. one major caveat of hepatic insulin production via gene therapy is that hepatocytes lack a regulated insulin secretory machinery that is present in pancreatic beta cells. several different viral and non-viral vectors are available to target insulin expression to liver  <cit> .

several studies indicate that liver cells can be engineered to secrete biologically active insulin  <cit> . furthermore, it has been demonstrated that introduction of the beta-cell specific transcription factors pdx- <dig> and neurod <dig> into hepatocytes ameliorates streptozotocin-induced hyperlgycemia in mice  <cit> . in a recent study, hepatocytes transfected with neurod <dig> and betacellulin, a β-cell growth factor, have been shown to produce insulin and to normalize blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice  <cit> .

changes in blood glucose levels directly control insulin secretion and also modulate the insulin-releasing effects of other secretagogues in pancreatic beta cells  <cit> . in addition to insulin secretion, increases in blood glucose levels also regulate insulin gene transcription by modulating the function of three beta cell specific transcription factors known as pdx- <dig>  mafa and neurod <dig>  defects in these transcription factors have been associated with decreased insulin production and hyperglycemia  <cit> .

in this study we demonstrate that the expression of human insulin or the beta-cell specific transcription factors pdx- <dig>  mafa and neurod <dig> in the hepa1- <dig> liver cell line or in primary liver cells using adenoviral gene transfer, results in production and secretion of insulin. furthermore, we show that insulin secretion from these engineered liver cells is stimulated by treatment with l-arginine via the nitric oxide pathway. l-arginine potentiates insulin secretion also in other cell lines such as fibroblasts and cervical carcinoma cells incubated with an adenovirus containing the human insulin cdna. this suggests that l-arginine stimulates protein secretion in various cell types via the synthesis of nitric oxide. the regulation of protein secretion by nitric oxide may be useful in the engineering of surrogate beta cells for the treatment of type  <dig> diabetes.

RESULTS
hepa1- <dig> liver cells transfected with an adenoviral vector containing human insulin are able to produce and secrete insulin
to test whether liver cells can be engineered to produce and secrete insulin in a regulated manner, we have incubated the hepa1- <dig> liver cell line with an adenovirus expressing human insulin. liver cells incubated with the human insulin adenovirus produced detectable amounts of insulin compared to the gfp only control virus, as demonstrated by immunostaining with an insulin antibody . next we quantified the amount of insulin secreted and the glucose-dependency of insulin secretion after treatment with  <dig> or  <dig> mm glucose using an insulin elisa kit. the total amount of insulin secreted was about  <dig> μu/ <dig> cells and the amount of insulin secreted in response to high glucose was not significantly higher than insulin secretion at  <dig> mm glucose .

l-arginine induces insulin secretion in the hepa1- <dig> liver cell line expressing human insulin via the nitric oxide pathway
since l-arginine acts as a potentiator of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, we tested the effect of l-arginine on insulin release in hepa1- <dig> liver cells expressing human insulin. treatment with  <dig> mm l-arginine for  <dig> h in the presence of  <dig> mm glucose increased insulin secretion over 3-fold . l-arginine has been reported to act via the nitric oxide pathway and therefore we determined whether the production of nitric oxide  was responsible for the increase in insulin secretion in hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin. for this purpose, we treated the hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin or gfp as control with  <dig> μm l-nna, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase  in the presence or absence of l-arginine . treatment with the general nos inhibitor l-nna for  <dig> h abolished the l-arginine-induced insulin secretion in hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin . treatment with l-nna also inhibited basal insulin secretion, suggesting the idea that no is responsible for some of the observed basal secretion of insulin.

next, we tested whether the no donor sodium nitroprusside  can induce insulin secretion similar to l-arginine. for this purpose, hepa1- <dig> liver cells were treated with  <dig> μm snp in the presence of  <dig> mm glucose for  <dig> h. like l-arginine, snp was also able to enhance insulin secretion , indicating that production of no stimulates insulin secretion. both, basal and l-arginine induced insulin secretion was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium . hepa1- <dig> cells incubated with krb buffer lacking calcium displayed a 2-fold reduction in insulin secretion independent of the presence of l-arginine . furthermore, inhibition of calcium channels using nifedipine abolished both basal and l-arginine stimulated insulin release .

insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells is mediated by regulated exocytosis in which the insulin containing granules fuse with the plasma membrane  <cit> . however, liver cells do not have a regulated exocytosis pathway and secretion in liver cells occurs via the constitutive secretory pathway. to test the effect of l-arginine on constitutive secretion in liver cells, we have treated hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin with brefeldin a , which blocks the constitutive secretion pathway by inhibiting the transport of proteins into the golgi apparatus  <cit> . treatment with brefeldin a blocked both basal and l-arginine stimulated insulin secretion in hepa1- <dig> cells , but did not effect the secretion of insulin from min <dig> insulinoma cells, which occurs via regulated exocytosis from insulin granules .

l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion in various non-beta cell lines incubated with the human insulin adenovirus
to determine whether the stimulatory effect of l-arginine on insulin secretion is specific to liver cells or not, we incubated the following cell lines with the human insulin adenovirus: hepg <dig> , nih3t <dig>  and hela . all three cell lines were able to produce and secrete insulin. however insulin secretion was highest in the hepg <dig> cell line and lowest in the hela cell line . treatment with  <dig> mm l-arginine for  <dig> h stimulated insulin secretion in every cell line tested to various degrees . addition of l-arginine enhanced insulin secretion by about 2-fold in the human liver cell line hepg <dig> , while insulin secretion was less than 2-fold in the fibroblast cell line nih3t <dig> and human cervical carcinoma . in every cell line tested, stimulation of insulin secretion by l-arginine was dependent on the production of nitric oxide, since addition of l-nna an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase abolished l-arginine mediated insulin secretion.

hepa1- <dig> liver cells expressing beta-cell specific transcription factors produce and secrete insulin
it has been previously shown that the beta-cell specific transcription factors such as pdx- <dig>  neurod <dig> and mafa are able to induce insulin gene transcription in non-beta cells. therefore, we introduced pdx- <dig>  neurod <dig> and mafa using adenoviral gene transfer into the hepa1- <dig> liver cell line and determined their effects on insulin production and secretion from liver cells. as demonstrated in fig.  <dig>  expression of all three beta-cell transcription factors in combination as well as individually induces insulin production in hepa1- <dig> cells compared to cells expressing only gfp as control. insulin secretion was highest in hepa1- <dig> cells expressing pdx- <dig> and lowest in hepa1- <dig> cells expressing mafa . insulin secretion in hepa1- <dig> cells expressing all three transcription factors at the same time was increased about  <dig> -fold by addition of  <dig> mm l-arginine . l-arginine stimulated insulin secretion was inhibited by addition of  <dig> μm l-nna, which inhibits nos .

l-arginine induces insulin secretion in primary rat liver cells expressing human insulin
all of our initial experiments were carried out using the hepatoma carcinoma cell line hepa1- <dig>  thus, we next confirmed the effects of l-arginine on insulin secretion in primary rat liver cells expressing human insulin. for this purpose, primary rat liver cells were cultured and incubated with an adenovirus containing human insulin . insulin secretion from primary hepatocytes was comparable to insulin secretion from the hepa1- <dig> cell line expressing human insulin and was slightly increased on high glucose compared to low glucose . as observed with the hepa1- <dig> cell line, secretion of insulin was more than 3-fold higher when primary rat liver cells expressing human insulin were incubated with  <dig> mm glucose in the presence of  <dig> mm l-arginine . the l-arginine mediated increase in insulin secretion was abolished after treatment with  <dig> μm l-nna , consistent with the idea that l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion via the nitric oxide pathway.

primary rat liver cells expressing the beta-cell specific transcription factors pdx- <dig>  neurod <dig> and mafa produce and secrete insulin
in addition to the human insulin adenovirus, we incubated primary rat liver cells with a combination of pdx- <dig>  neurod <dig> and mafa adenoviruses. the expression of these transcription factors in primary liver cells was confirmed by western blotting . we found that insulin secretion in primary rat liver cells expressing the transcription factors was only 4% of that observed in primary hepatocytes expressing human insulin . insulin secretion was also slightly increased by high glucose . incubation of these cells with  <dig> mm l-arginine in the presence of  <dig> mm glucose increased insulin secretion by 2-fold . the observed increase in insulin secretion was diminished after addition of the nos inhibitor l-nna .

discussion
in this study, we have demonstrated that expression of human insulin or beta cell specific transcription factors in the hepa1- <dig> liver cell line or primary rat hepatocytes results in production and secretion of insulin. however, the secretion of insulin from these engineered cells was not very responsive to changes in glucose levels. furthermore, we have expressed human insulin also in various cell lines such as hepg <dig> , nih3t <dig>  and hela  cells. all of these cell lines were able to produce and secrete insulin.

l-arginine has been found to stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells  <cit> . therefore, we determined the effect of l-arginine on insulin secretion from the engineered hepa1- <dig> cell line or primary hepatocytes and found that l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion up to 3-fold in these engineered tissues. the l-arginine mediated enhancement of insulin secretion was via the production of no, since inhibition of nitric oxide synthase  abolished this effect. furthermore, treatment with sodium nitroprusside, which is an no donor stimulated insulin secretion similar to l-arginine.

insulin secretion from hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin depends on the presence of calcium. lack of calcium or inhibition of the calcium channels with nifedipine abolishes both basal and l-arginine stimulated insulin secretion. brefeldin a  is an agent that blocks the transport of proinsulin to the trans-golgi network, but has no effect on insulin secretion via granule exocytosis  <cit> . addition of bfa to hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin blocked the secretion of insulin, while it had no effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell line min <dig>  this indicates that insulin secretion from hepa1- <dig> cells expressing human insulin is due to constitutive secretion, while secretion of insulin in pancreatic beta cells occurs via the regulated exocytotic pathway as expected. furthermore, l-arginine-mediated insulin secretion was also inhibited by bfa, suggesting that l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion via the nitric oxide pathway by enhancing the constitutive protein secretion pathway.

the exact mechanism by which no produced from l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion from liver cells is not known. since liver cells were exposed to l-arginine only for  <dig> h, the observed enhancement of insulin secretion is unlikely due to transcriptional effects. there was no difference in insulin mrna levels in cells treated with l-arginine for  <dig> h compared to untreated cells . no has been previously reported to stimulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis. synaptic proteins such as snap  <dig>  syntaxin and vamp are known to be involved in no mediated secretion  <cit> . it has been reported that no is capable of s-nitrosylation of neuronal proteins including snap- <dig> and nsf  <cit> . no has been also shown to associate with snare proteins, which play a main role in the secretory pathway  <cit> . we propose that the production of no from l-arginine enhances secretion in liver by either nitrosylation of secretory proteins such as snap- <dig> or by direct interaction of no with the secretory pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented data indicate that liver cells and other non-beta cells can be engineered to produce and secrete insulin. although insulin secretion from these engineered cells is not very responsive to changes in glucose levels, addition of l-arginine stimulates insulin secretion up to 3-fold via the nitric oxide pathway. stimulation of insulin secretion from surrogate beta cells via the production of no could provide a potential therapy for the treatment of type  <dig> diabetes. instead of glucose, engineered liver cells can be induced to secrete insulin using nitric oxide precursors such as nitroprusside. since nitric oxide is very unstable, insulin secretion stimulated by nitric oxide would be transient and may avoid hypoglycemia as observed by constitutive secretion of insulin from engineered cells. further studies will investigate the molecular basis of stimulation of insulin secretion by l-arginine in surrogate β cells, which will be a useful step in the development of insulin-replacement therapies of diabetes. future experiments will also determine whether l-arginine can stimulate insulin secretion and thereby correct hyperglycemia in diabetic animals expressing insulin in liver.
