BACKGROUND
infection due to campylobacter sp. is one of the major causes of diarrheal disease worldwide and is the most common source of bacterial gastroenteritis  <cit> . although transmission of campylobacter occurs mainly through the consumption of livestock, with poultry being the most common source, c. jejuni has been isolated from diverse animal, human and environmental sources. several recent studies have sought to determine clonal prevalences amongst isolates from these diverse sources by applying multilocus sequence typing   <cit> . whilst some mlst clonal complexes, such as the st- <dig> complex, are widespread, others, such as the st- <dig> and st- <dig> complexes, have a more restricted distribution amongst different host animals, including humans  <cit> .

the complete genome sequences have been published for the c. jejuni strains nctc <dig>  <cit> , rm <dig>  <cit>  and c. jejuni strain 81– <dig>  <cit> , including its ptet and pvir plasmids  <cit> . genome sequences have also been published for strains of c. lari, c. coli and c. upsaliensis  <cit>  and further genome sequence projects for several other campylobacter strains are ongoing  <cit> . although unpublished, the genome of c. fetus is also complete. in addition, strain-specific dna sequences have been identified for c. jejuni atcc <dig>  <cit> .

there has been considerable interest in characterising genetic variation between isolates of c. jejuni with a view to identifying those genes relevant to severity of disease or host colonisation. inter-strain variations in loci such as those encoding lipooligosaccharide   <cit> , capsule  <cit>  or restriction-modification  systems  <cit>  have already been characterised. comparative genome analyses using microarrays, based largely upon the strain nctc <dig> genome sequence  <cit> , indicate high levels of genome diversity but low levels of genome plasticity in c. jejuni  <cit> . recently it has been suggested that this kind of approach can help to identify genetic markers predictive of the source of an infection  <cit> .

since these studies were mostly restricted to those genes present in a single strain, nctc <dig>  further identification of such markers would be greatly facilitated by the construction of microarrays containing all potentially variable genes. genes contributing to plasticity amongst c. jejuni populations have been identified from the genomes of strains such as rm <dig>  81– <dig> and atcc <dig>  <cit> . however, it is not clear whether the widely accessible nucleotide and protein sequence databases are representative of the variable genes that occur in c. jejuni.

suppression subtractive hybridisation  is a method designed to identify sequences present in one strain  but absent from a reference strain   <cit>  and has been applied previously to identify genetic differences between two c. jejuni human isolates with different colonisation potentials  <cit> . in this study we used several rounds of ssh between and within c. jejuni mlst clonal complexes, using isolates from various sources, in order to gain a better understanding of the genomic variability that remains uncharacterised in populations of c. jejuni. furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of variable genes involved in the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors may be related to host preference.

RESULTS
ssh libraries
our initial choice of restriction enzymes for the digestion of dnas in the ssh was based on a previous study of c. jejuni  <cit> . a summary of all of the ssh sequences obtained is shown in table  <dig>  the ssh libraries obtained with alui/drai-digested dnas were dominated by very short dna sequences . in order to obtain longer sequences we carried out two further subtractions using rsai-digested dnas. this reduced the proportion of sequences < <dig> bp in length. the majority of subtracted sequences from strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> matched sequences previously found in c. jejuni strains rm <dig> or 81– <dig>  thus, in an attempt to enrich for sequences not previously reported, the final two subtractions were carried out with strain  <dig>  as an additional driver to strain nctc <dig> . this proved successful in that the majority of ssh sequences no longer matched strains rm <dig> or 81– <dig>  however, the overall proportion of ssh sequences matching previously reported campylobacter sp. was not reduced significantly. the combination of enrichment and the choice of an enzyme giving longer ssh fragments resulted in fewer ssh sequences overall .

in total,  <dig> subtracted sequences were obtained. details of these are given in additional file  <dig>  these ssh sequences were all confirmed as absent from the driver strain c. jejuni nctc <dig>  even though occasionally the best blastx match in the database was against this strain. furthermore, the second driver strain, strain  <dig>  was pcr-negative for nine of  <dig> sequences tested from the two dual driver subtractions. of the  <dig> ssh sequences obtained only two  had a best blastx match with proteins from outside the genus campylobacter. a further three ssh sequences  had no significant blastx match. thus, the vast majority of ssh sequences matched within the genus campylobacter. however, it should be noted that eight ssh sequences , although having a best blastx match with a campylobacter sp. protein, shared less than 80% identity with the matching protein. those ssh sequences matching outside the genus campylobacter, matching campylobacter sequences with <80% identity, or used in distribution analysis are shown in table  <dig> 

both the mean and the median % gc content for the  <dig> subtracted sequences was 29%, with a range of 18–42%. the mean % gc contents varied little between the subtractions . thus, the average % gc contents for the subtracted sequences was only slightly below the values reported for the genomes of the c. jejuni strains nctc <dig>   <cit>  or rm <dig>   <cit> .

of the three subtractions conducted using alui/drai-digested dnas and a single driver strain , two were intra-clonal complex and one was between clonal complexes. the numbers of subtracted sequences obtained did not vary significantly between these subtractions . however, there were some variations in the putative functions of subtracted sequences. plasmid and bacteriophage-associated sequences accounted for 73% of those sequences differing between the two st- <dig> complex strains  <dig> and nctc <dig>  and 16% of those sequences differing between the two st- <dig> complex strains  <dig> and nctc <dig>  but only 2% of those sequences differing between the st- <dig> complex strain  <dig> and strain nctc <dig>  the largest group of subtracted sequences for the inter-clonal complex subtraction were those associated with metabolism/biosynthesis . the ssh data suggest that there are both intra- and inter-clonal complex variations in genes associated with los, capsule, flagella/motility, membrane/transport and metabolism .

it has been demonstrated that ssh is an effective method for analysing genetic differences between related strains. in a previous study using ssh, agron et al.  <cit>  were able to detect most of the 7% of genomic differences between two closely related, fully sequenced strains of helicobacter pylori. unlike in our study, the authors used four parallel subtractions with different restriction enzymes. however, they further demonstrated that as tester-specific sequences became limiting the proportion of repeat fragments increased  <cit> . because of our use of single restriction digestion conditions for each subtraction, we cannot claim the extent of coverage achieved by agron et al.  <cit> , but the increased proportion of repeat sequences obtained with the dual driver subtractions is indicative of a reduction in the overall pool of tester-specific sequences in these subtractions. it is our belief that we have detected a significant proportion of the genetic variation between the strains and that our data indicate that there are very few genes present in c. jejuni strains with best blastx matches outside the genus rather than with already sequenced genes/proteins from within the genus.

ssh sequences matching outside the genus campylobacter
the two sequences matching outside the genus campylobacter were a putative transport protein  and a putative phosphodiesterase  . these ssh sequences have been submitted to genbank . the predicted protein sequence derived from ssh629-d <dig> matched a transport protein from rhodopseudomonas palustris, predicted to be a cytoplasmic component of an abc-type sugar transport system. the gene encoding the phosphodiesterase enzyme from delftia acidovorans matching ssh629-d <dig> has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it shares sequence similarity to cyclic amp  phosphodiesterase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and exhibited activity on camp in vivo  <cit> . using dot-blot hybridization, we determined the distribution of these two ssh sequences amongst a panel of c. jejuni isolates representative of common mlst clonal complexes and various sources . the sequences ssh629-d <dig> and ssh629-d <dig> were found only in the st- <dig> complex . it should be noted that ssh629-d <dig> appears to be part of a pseudogene containing a frame-shift mutation. we used pcr amplification to amplify this region from four of the c. jejuni isolates testing positive for ssh629-d <dig>  including strain  <dig>  and confirmed that this mutation is genuinely present and not an artefact of the ssh procedure.

genomic islands and mobile elements
the distributions of ssh sequences according to the function of the matching proteins varied considerably between strains, reflecting the divergence amongst those strains chosen . the ssh data suggest that the st- <dig> wild duck isolate, strain  <dig>  contains at least parts of two of the mobile elements reported previously in c. jejuni rm <dig>   <cit> . cmlp <dig> is a mu-like bacteriophage and wasn't identified in any of the other tester strains used in this study. cjie <dig> carries sequences similar to a putative prophage encoded by c. lari   <cit> . strain  <dig> alone also carried multiple sequences matching the related ptet or pcc <dig> plasmids reported previously in c. jejuni 81– <dig> and c. coli respectively  <cit> . ssh data also indicated that the st- <dig> cattle isolate strain  <dig> carries the prophage-like element cjie <dig> . however, none of the strain  <dig> ssh sequences matched plasmid sequences. in fact, other than those matching cjie <dig>  most of the ssh sequences from strain  <dig> matched hypothetical proteins of unknown function . the ssh sequences from strains  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each representing a different mlst type, contained no matches to the genomic islands of strain rm <dig> and very few matches to either bacteriophage or plasmid-related sequences .

using dot-blot hybridization we determined the distribution of the sequence 670-d <dig> as an indicator of the prevalence of the ptet/pcc <dig> plasmid amongst our strain panel . the sequence was found in three isolates from the st- <dig> complex and four isolates from the st- <dig> complex.

plasticity regions and variable genes
most of the subtractions identified variations in loci previously reported as variable amongst c. jejuni strains. it has been reported that variable genes  in the campylobacter genome map to discrete areas, termed variously plasticity regions, hypervariable regions or plasticity zones  <cit> . indeed the genotypes of c. jejuni strains have been shown to be inherently unstable, and recombination events occur between unrelated strains both in vitro and in vivo even in the absence of selective pressure  <cit> . pearson et al.  <cit>  identified seven hypervariable plasticity regions  in the genome of c. jejuni nctc <dig>  pr <dig> contains the capsule biosynthesis locus, flanked by capsule transport genes. twelve ssh sequences in all matched capsule-related proteins. pr <dig> contains numerous putative outer membrane proteins but also carries a divergent gene encoding a probable flagellar hook protein  <cit> . other motility-related genes, including flagellin and flagellin-glycosylation genes, are carried by pr <dig>  along with los biosynthesis genes. ssh sequences matching flagellar hook proteins , flagellins, flagellin glycosylation proteins and los biosynthesis proteins were all identified amongst the ssh sequences in our study. pr <dig> includes glycosyltransferases and galactosyltransferases of unknown functions as well as genes involved in the sialylation of los. ssh sequences matching proteins with similar putative functions were found with both the strain  <dig> and strain  <dig> subtractions. in addition, the  <dig> subtracted library included one sequence matching both the nctc <dig> gmha gene  and a polysaccharide-related protein .

rm systems protect bacteria from foreign dna and may impact on the transfer of genes responsible for virulence or host colonisation. it has also been demonstrated previously that rm genes vary in campylobacter spp.  <cit>  and rm genes were amongst those identified in a previous study using ssh  <cit> . the first three subtractions in our study all identified rm-related ssh sequences. ahmed et al.  <cit>  also identified subtracted sequences relating to arsenite-metabolising genes as present in strain 81– <dig> but absent from strain nctc <dig>  noting that phenylarsonic compounds have been used in poultry feed and may have contaminated agricultural lands on which poultry litter has been used as manure. we identified an ssh matching the arsenical resistance protein of rm <dig> in the subtracted library of strain  <dig> , a rabbit isolate. in addition, ahmed et al.  <cit>  identified a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase gene in their subtraction. equivalent genes have been implicated in a role in colonization of the gastric mucosa by helicobacter pylori  <cit> . we also identified ssh sequences matching a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase protein in strain  <dig>  it has been reported that c. jejuni 81– <dig> carries a putative gene encoding a serine protease belonging to the autotransporter family  <cit> . the ssh indicates that this gene is also present in the cattle isolate  <dig> . c. jejuni 81– <dig> and isolates  <dig> are both members of the st- <dig> clonal complex. we determined the distribution of ssh1967-a <dig> amongst our strain panel. all st- <dig> isolates were positive for ssh1967-a <dig>  of the other isolates, only one st- <dig> cattle isolate contained ssh1967-a <dig> .

we also determined the distribution of the ssh sequence ssh961-a <dig>  which matches an enzyme from c. jejuni subsp. doylei . with the exception of three isolates, the distribution was also restricted to the clonal complex of the tester strain .

metabolic genes
when oxygen levels are low c. jejuni has the capacity to utilise a wide range of electron acceptors, including fumarate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfite, trimethylamine-n-oxide  and dimethyl sulfoxide   <cit> . in strain nctc <dig> pr <dig> contains genes encoding the transport apparatus for molybdenum, which has a putative role in the reduction of nitrate as an alternative terminal electron acceptor  <cit> . just upstream of pr <dig> lies the gene  encoding the reductase responsible for reduction of tmao and dmso under oxygen limiting conditions  <cit> . whilst lacking the cj0264c gene or its close homologues, c. jejuni 81– <dig> carries an alternative dmso reductase gene cluster , and an additional cytochrome c biogenenesis gene cluster   <cit> . cytochrome c may be an important link between the menaquinine pool and alternative terminal electron acceptors such as dmso and tmao  <cit> . it has been suggested that the capacity of campylobacter isolates to utilise alternative electron acceptors may contribute to selective advantages in specific ecological niches  <cit> , and that the presence of additional respiratory capabilities may contribute to the efficiency of colonisation of highly pathogenic strains such as c. jejuni 81– <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the presence or absence of particular genes or islands contributing to growth in microaerophilic environments may influence host preference. hofreuter et al.  recently provided some evidence for this when demonstrating that a dmsa mutant of c. jejuni 81– <dig> colonised mice less well than its wild-type equivalent in a mixed infection model.

we identified several strain-variable ssh sequences matching putative enzymes with roles in electron transport using alternative terminal electron acceptors. the ssh library constructed from strain  <dig>  included ssh sequences with best blastx matches against genes in the cytochrome c biogenesis cluster of c. jejuni 81– <dig> . the ssh library constructed from strain  <dig>  included numerous ssh sequences  with a best blastx match against the dmsabc genes of c. jejuni 81– <dig>  the ssh libraries constructed from strains  <dig>   <dig> and strain  <dig> each contained ssh sequences  matching a pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase from c. jejuni 84- <dig> belonging to a family of enzymes that can play a role in electron transport. ssh sequences ssh670-b <dig> and ssh504-c <dig> were identical to each other.

in order to test the hypothesis that the distribution of such metabolic genes may be related to host preference, we chose to screen a panel of isolates varying in mlst type and source for the presence or absence of four representative sequences . ssh1967-h <dig> and ssh1967-c <dig> were chosen to represent the alternative dmso reductase gene cluster , and the additional cytochrome c biogenenesis gene cluster , of c. jejuni 81– <dig> respectively.  ssh1967-c <dig> was chosen to represent the pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase described in c. jejuni 84- <dig>  in addition, the cj0264c gene of strain nctc <dig>  encoding a reductase, was included.

interestingly, of the  <dig> c. jejuni isolates screened, only two  shared the sequences ssh1967-h <dig> and ssh1967-c <dig>  whilst a further  <dig> lacked both sequences, including all of the st- <dig> isolates. for most of the clonal complexes  the sequences ssh1967-h <dig> and ssh1967-c <dig> were mutually exclusive.

there was a strong correlation between the distribution of the two reductase-related sequences  or the cytochrome c biogenesis-related sequence  and the mlst clonal complex. it has been reported previously that the c. jejuni nctc <dig> orf cj0264c, which encodes the sole tmao and dmso reductase in this strain  <cit> , was absent or highly divergent in  <dig> strains amongst a panel of  <dig> c. jejuini strains from diverse sources  <cit> . our data indicated that this gene was widespread amongst all clonal complexes in our panel of strains, with the exception of the st- <dig> complex .

in our study, there was no evidence for an association between the presence of a particular gene associated with metabolism using alternative electron acceptors and the source of the isolate, suggesting that the presence or absence of these alternative metabolic genes does not play a significant role in niche preferences. however, it should be noted that our strain panel was dominated by isolates from cattle and human sources. thus we cannot completely rule out such associations with other host species. in a study of gene expression variations by different variants of c. jejuni nctc <dig> it was reported that many of the differences in gene expression were in respiration and metabolism genes  <cit> . the authors suggested that adaptation to different oxygen tensions may influence colonisation potential. the gene expression profiles compared were those of c. jejuni nctc 11168-gs, the genome-sequenced isolate, and nctc 11168-o, the original isolate from which nctc11168-gs was derived. of the two, isolate nctc 11168-o is a much better coloniser of chicks and invades tissue culture cells far more efficiently  <cit> . under microaerobic and severely oxygen-limited conditions there were marked difference in the expression of genes associated with metabolism and respiration. although orf cj0264c was not amongst those loci expressed differently between the two variants of nctc  <dig>  such observations support the notion that rather than the presence or absence of metabolic and respiratory genes per se, variations in expression may be more relevant to niche preference.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have demonstrated that by broadening the range of clonal complexes and host sources of c. jejuni isolates submitted to genetic interrogation, we did not greatly increase the pool of identified strain-variable genes. this suggests that the current database already contains most of the diversity within this species. however, it should also be noted that genes currently associated with other closely related species, such as c. coli, can also make a contribution to the diversity within c. jejuni.

it is clear from our subtractions between st- <dig> complex isolates that variation in gene content occurs within as well as between clonal complexes. however, our survey of strain-variable sequences, including four associated with genes involved in the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors, indicated a distribution according to clonal complex rather than host source. thus, we found no evidence that the presence or absence of such genes plays a role in the host preferences of c. jejuni strains.
