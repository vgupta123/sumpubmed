BACKGROUND
the filamentous actinobacterium microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> is a potentially relevant industrial bacterial strain since it produces the lantibiotic nai- <dig>  <cit> , an antibiotic peptide active against gram-positive bacteria - including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci  - and some gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  the mlb cluster has been demonstrated to contain genes encoding enzymes required for nai- <dig> biosynthesis, pathway specific regulators, and proteins involved in secretion and self-resistance mechanism   <cit> . the nai- <dig> cluster is highly similar to the mib cluster present in m. corallina nrrl  <dig>  where the function of the corresponding gene products and the mechanisms regulating gene expression have been elucidated  <cit> . similarly to other lantibiotics  <cit> , nai- <dig> is ribosomally synthesized as a precursor peptide that is encoded by the mlba structural gene. the nai- <dig> precursor undergoes extensive modifications, including the formation of meso-lanthionine  or 3-methyllanthionine  residues, before the removal of the n-terminal leader peptide and the secretion of the final  <dig> amino acid-long product.

in streptomyces coelicolor, the most studied actinomycete used as model strain, the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites is elicited as a developmental program and a physiological response to a variety of environmental stimuli and conditions, which depend on cell density, nature and/or quantity of carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources . from a molecular cell biology perspective, production of these secondary metabolites is generally associated with a cascade of regulatory proteins, which span from those playing pleiotropic roles to pathway-specific regulators controlling anabolic or catabolic genes and, eventually, gene products responsible for antibiotic biosynthesis. a comprehensive understanding of such a complex network of signalling, regulatory circuits and biochemical reactions may be in principle difficult, labour intensive and time consuming. nowadays, the continuous integration of bioinformatic tools and holistic technologies has allowed the development of consolidated strategies to manage the huge amounts of molecular information on gene expression and biochemical capabilities deriving from “omic” investigations, ultimately leading to novel perspectives and approaches to explore microbial strain physiology  <cit> . in this context, proteomics has recently been used for shedding light on the relationships among overall metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of interesting bioactive molecules in several actinomycete strains .

in the perspective of using microbispora strains for the industrial synthesis of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, insights on the molecular cell physiology of this rare genus of filamentous actinobacteria would be beneficial to develop robust and economically-feasible production processes. thus, due to the promising applicative scenario of nai- <dig> and the limited knowledge on microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  an extensive investigation on the proteomic changes associated with lantibiotic production was carried out on the wild-type  strain at different fermentation stages by using combined two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis  and mass spectrometry  approaches. in addition, with the aim to confirm results concerning the impact of nai- <dig> on microbispora physiology, comparative proteomic experiments were performed on a microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> lantibiotic-null producer strain after the exposure to nai- <dig>  all proteomic data were integrated with bioinformatic, confocal microscopy and genetic engineering results in order to elucidate regulatory networks, biochemical pathways and molecular processes linking bacterial growth and nai- <dig> production, thus providing the first global functional picture of a member of the microbispora genus.

RESULTS
growth parameters and nai- <dig> production kinetics
when incubated in the kv <dig> complex medium, microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> wt showed a growth kinetics characterized by a stage of active mycelial cell growth and biomass accumulation , ranging from a-66 h to a-96 h, which was followed by a stage of general cell growth arrest and cellular lysis occurrences, as inferred by biomass content decline  from d-117 h to d-191 h . the a and d stages of biomass accumulation profiles paralleled the kinetics of medium concentration changes of glucose, phosphate and ammonium as well as of ph variation during cultivation time . in particular, glucose resulted progressively consumed and then completely exhausted at d-117 h . the medium inorganic phosphate  content gradually decreased until a-90 h, reaching the lowest value, and then progressively increased during d substages . the content of hydrolysable phosphate from medium organic sources  showed a decreasing trend during the a substages that became more rapid during the transition from a to d substages where po resulted almost exhausted at d-117 h and completely exhausted thereafter. the medium ammonia content resulted slightly fluctuating until d-117 h and then gradually increased . in agreement with glucose consumption and the ammonia concentration profile, the medium ph was characterized by a bi-phasic profile  comprising: i) a first stage of acidification ending at a-96 h, which is probably a consequence of the production of organic acids from glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid  cycle  <cit> ; ii) a second stage of ph increase, which is probably due to ammonia produced by medium peptide hydrolysis and amino acid utilization as carbon and nitrogen source during growth . nai- <dig> production was observed starting from a-90 h, when the glucose concentration in the medium was about 3 g/l . nai- <dig> accumulation still occurred at d- <dig> and d-140 h, when nai- <dig> production reached the maximum yield. at d-162 h and thereafter, nai- <dig> amount dropped down .fig.  <dig> growth parameters of microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> wt strain. each value is the mean of three independent measurements performed on parallel cultivations. error bars represent standard deviation. kinetic profiles during cultivation time of: glucose concentration, bacterial biomass and nai- <dig> production yields ; inorganic  and organic  phosphate concentration ; ph values and ammonia concentration . squares: glucose triangles: percentage of packed mycelium volume . asterisks: nai- <dig>  black circles: pi. empty circles: po. black diamonds: ph. empty diamonds: ammonia. in a panel, numbered arrows represent time points of biomass sampling:  <dig>  a-66 h;  <dig>  a-90 h;  <dig>  d-117 h;  <dig>  d-140 h;  <dig>  d-162 h



experimental design of the proteome analyses of microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> wt strain
differential proteomic analyses were accomplished by comparing whole protein extracts from wt strain biomass samples collected: i) at a- <dig> and a-90 h time-points, corresponding to a substages preceding and following the lantibiotic production onset, respectively, ; ii) at d- <dig>  d- <dig> and d <dig> h time-points, when nai- <dig> production yield firstly reaches a maximum and then progressively decreases . thus, additional file 1: table s <dig> reports the quantitative proteomic changes between a- <dig> and a-90 h substages, detailing the molecular events associated with or leading to nai- <dig> production in a context characterized by an active biomass accumulation supported by glucose utilization. on the other end, additional file 2: table s <dig> illustrates the quantitative variations between d- <dig>  d- <dig> and d-162 h substages, showing the cellular protein complement associated with the maintenance, first, and the decline, then, of nai- <dig> production in a context of glucose exhaustion and biomass content decrement. in addition, since it has been previously demonstrated that the genetic regulatory circuits controlling the biosynthesis of the lantibiotic nisin  <cit>  and nisin biosynthesis itself  <cit>  partly occur at the membrane level, a proteomic comparison between a- <dig> and a-90 h substages was also carried out on ad hoc prepared bacterial membrane extracts. additional file 3: table s <dig> shows the corresponding results for protein quantification and identification.

the time sampling of the a and d stage differential proteome analyses was corroborated by principal component analysis  performed on protein abundance 2d-patterns and by the overall diminished representation of primary metabolism enzymes during d substages, as detailed in the “additional file 4: supplementary results section and in additional file 5: figure s <dig> and s <dig>  the reliability of quantitative proteomic results was demonstrated by the coherent trend of the amount of protein species encoded by genes organized as putative operons, as detailed in the “additional file 4: supplementary results section. microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> proteomic 2d-maps, representative of the above-mentioned experimental conditions, are provided in a digitalized database built as an interactive webpage available at http://www.unipa.it/ampuglia/microbispora/. a detailed description of this database is provided in the “additional file 4: supplementary results section.

comparative proteomic analysis between a substages preceding and following the lantibiotic production onset
proteomic analysis of the whole protein extracts revealed  <dig> differentially represented protein species. among that,  <dig> increased and  <dig> decreased their abundance in the biomass sampled at a-90 h, with respect to the one taken at a-66 h . on the other hand, proteomic analysis of the membrane protein extracts revealed  <dig> differentially represented spots; among that,  <dig> increased and  <dig> decreased their abundance in the above-mentioned comparison . protein spots from both experiments were analyzed by ms procedures, which assigned them to specific orfs in the microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> genome  <cit> . corresponding proteins were then clustered into nine groups  according to the predicted functions, based on blast interrogations against the kegg <dig> database  <cit> . spots corresponding to multiple protein identification   were excluded from functional analysis. gene products associated with secondary metabolism were grouped also considering the information deriving from a previous bioinformatic analysis  <cit> . both proteomic datasets, having  <dig> orf products in common, showed proteins with unknown function  as the most represented group, followed by those involved in: i) amino acid, carbon, nucleotide and protein metabolism  in the case of global proteome analysis; ii) amino acid, carbon and protein metabolism  in the case of membrane proteome analysis. the distribution into functional groups of increased or decreased protein species from both proteomic datasets revealed similar profiles, with the exception of that involved in nucleotide and protein metabolism, oxidoreduction and oxidative stress response , which showed different quantitative trends at global and membrane levels . thus, both membrane and global proteomic analyses revealed that functional groups including protein species involved in amino acid, carbon and energy metabolism were mostly down-regulated at a-90 h , while those containing components associated with secondary metabolism or having unknown function were mostly up-regulated at this time point. some of the most interesting proteins presenting a differential abundance are detailed below within sub-paragraphs highlighting specific metabolic pathways and molecular processes, which are put in relationship with nai- <dig> production onset.fig.  <dig> functional distribution of the differentially represented protein species at the a and d stages. functional distribution of the differentially represented protein species in the whole extract from the proteome comparison a-90 h vs a-66 h . functional distribution of the differentially represented protein species in the membrane extract from the proteome comparison a-90 h vs a-66 h . functional distribution of the differentially represented protein species in the whole extract from the proteome comparison d-117 h vs d-140 h . functional distribution of the differentially represented protein species in the whole extract from the proteome comparison d-117 h vs d-162 h . functional distribution of the differentially represented protein species in the whole extract from rp <dig> cells exposed to nai- <dig>  with respect to unexposed cells used as control . a: amino acid metabolism; b: carbon metabolism; c: energy metabolism; d: nucleotide metabolism; e: others; f: oxidoreduction and oxidative stress; g: protein metabolism; h: secondary metabolism; i: unknown function

carbon metabolism
most of the differentially represented enzymes involved in carbon metabolism showed a decreased abundance at a-90 h . in particular, as detailed in the “additional file 4: supplemetary results section, almost all glycolytic enzymes and enzymes using glycolysis products as substrates showed a decreased abundance at a-90 h, in coincidence with the dropping down of the glucose concentration in the medium , which may be also related with a differential expression of genes involved in glycogen metabolism. in this context, the down-representation of two glycogen phosphorylase  protein species, coupled with the over-representation of a corresponding proteolytic fragment, and the concomitant slight increment of the alpha amylase glge abundance at a-90 h suggested an increased glycogen conversion to trehalose, whose intracellular synthesis is associated with morpho-physiological development and stress resistance capability in streptomycetes  <cit> .

among the a-90 h over-represented proteins belonging to the carbon metabolism group, worth mentioning are some tca cycle enzymes, such as citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase iron-sulfur subunit . their up-regulation may be put in relation with an increased production of the alpha-keto acids deriving from the utilization of peptides and amino acids present in the medium. this possibility is supported by the over-representation at a-90 h of different protein species, which were further identified as two putative peptidases  and four proteins with unknown function. an intensive-mode phyre <dig> analysis  <cit>  also designed the latter proteins as possible alkaline serine proteases , peptidase  and trypsin-like protein , with a confidence greater than 90 % for a percentage identity spanning from 56 % to 69 %. coherently with this context, ammonia concentration slightly increased moving from a-66 h to a-90 h substages  as a consequence of medium peptide hydrolysis and amino acid utilization .fig.  <dig> growth kinetics parameters of the microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> rp <dig> strain. biomass accumulation profiles of nai- <dig> exposed  and unexposed  cultivations measured as percentage of packed mycelium volume  . nai- <dig> was added at 72 h; ph and glucose concentration profiles of nai- <dig> exposed  and unexposed  cultivations . numbered arrows in a panel represent biomass sampling:  <dig>  unexposed cultivations;  <dig>  cultivations 24 h exposed to nai-107



some enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were observed as differentially accumulated during a substages. among that, worth mentioning is the down-representation of 3-oxoacyl-acp synthase ii  that is involved de novo lipid synthesis. fabf showed a coherent profile in both membrane and whole proteome analyses, which also paralleled the over-representation of proteins involved in: i) recycling of fatty acids, such as ab-hydrolase associated lipase that presented subtle quantitative changes in membrane proteome analysis); ii) lipid modifications, like the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase sdr  and cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase .

amino acid and amino sugar metabolism
concerning proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, few enzymes resulted over-represented in coincidence of nai- <dig> production at a-90 h. among that, worth mentioning is glutamine synthetase  , a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism that catalyzes the biosynthesis of glutamine starting from glutamate and ammonia  <cit> , whose concentration increased from a- <dig> to a-90 h. in agreement with this result, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase  was also over-represented at a-90 h ; this enzyme catalyzes the first step of amino sugar biosynthesis, which leads to the synthesis of glucosamine-6p using glutamine as ammonia donor. interestingly, increased levels of gfpt paralleled with the over-representation at a-90 h of diaminopimelate epimerase, udp-n-acetylmuramate-alanine ligase and udp-n-acetylmuramoylalanyl-d-glutamyl- <dig> - diaminopimelate--d-alanyl-d-alanyl ligase, whose encoding genes are organized in putative operons ; these proteins are all involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall stem peptide, thus revealing an up-regulation of this cellular process during nai- <dig> production at a-90 h.

protein metabolism
according to the general down-representation of enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism during nai- <dig> production at a-90 h, protein components involved in protein biosynthesis, folding and export were generally under-represented in both global and membrane proteomic maps. on the other hand, many proteins associated with protein degradation and turnover resulted over-represented therein. a detailed description of those changes is provided in the additional file 4: supplementary results section. the putative functional role of etk <dig> , etk <dig> , etk <dig> , etk <dig> , etk <dig> , and etk <dig>  proteases has been mentioned above.

nucleotide metabolism
at a-90 h, proteomic analysis of whole bacterial extracts suggested a decreased representation of proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, dna replication and, in accordance with the observed down-regulation of protein biosynthesis, rna synthesis. interestingly, some enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism were observed as associated with membranes too. the detailed description of the abundance profile of these proteins is provided in additional file 4: supplementary results section; it is consistent with a global metabolic context of decreased nucleotide synthesis.

proteins involved in nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur metabolism
the accumulation profile of key factors involved in phosphate, nitrogen and sulphur metabolism were positively associated with nai- <dig> production and, in the first two cases, with the measured concentration profiles of pi, po  and ammonia  in the spent medium. this was evident from the augmented abundance levels detected at a-90 h for: i) psts and phoh proteins that are part of the pho regulon, whose members are devoted to the scavenging for phosphate from organic sources and assimilation thereof  <cit> ; ii) the putatively co-transcribed gene products p-ii  and protein-pii uridylyltransferase  , and the above-mentioned glna, which ultimately control the cell utilization of ammonia  <cit> ; iii) thiosulfate sulfurtransferase that is involved in sulphur metabolism.

regulatory proteins of morpho-physiological differentiation
some bld-like proteins  <cit>  were detected as differentially represented in coincidence of nai- <dig> production at a-90 h. in particular, the microbispora lipoprotein bldk, which is an abc-type permease involved in mycelium differentiation by permitting the transport of the morphogenic oligopeptide bld <dig> in s. coelicolor  <cit> , was found as under-represented in its two intact isoforms and over-represented in its putative proteolytic fragment to highlight a decreased need of its function during nai- <dig> production. instead, the anti-anti sigma factor bldg showed augmented levels in concomitance of nai- <dig> biosynthesis, which well paralleled the moderate increment of the transcriptional regulator bldd. this result may be consistent with a synchronized progression of physiological regulatory events in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  suggesting an early accumulation of bldk at a-66 h, whose abundance dropped down with the concomitant accumulation of bldg and bldd at a-90 h, according to the regulatory cascade proposed in s. coelicolor  <cit> . in s. coelicolor, the bld cascade has already been associated with a growth rate decrement due to nutrient limitation that activates the biosynthesis of the intracellular signalling molecule ppgpp  <cit> . in agreement with this observation, microbispora obge gtpase showed a modest, but appreciable, abundance increment, while pnpase presented decreased abundance levels of intact species and augmented representation of the corresponding degradation products during nai- <dig> production. the first protein is an important modulator of bacterial physiological differentiation by controlling the decrease of gtp pool, while the second one is an enzyme involved in mrna degradation. in s. coelicolor, the obge homologue has been shown to control biomass production positively and bacterial differentiation negatively throughout ppgpp level regulation  <cit> . on the other hand, pnpase is negatively controlled by ppgpp in actinomycetes  <cit> . by describing the dynamics of the corresponding isoforms during nai- <dig> production, this proteomic study suggests the occurrence of post-translational regulatory mechanisms determining decreased pnpase levels in concomitance of the antibiotic biosynthesis.

secondary metabolism proteins
an accumulation of mlb gene products  <cit>  was observed at a-90 h. in particular, mlbf and mlbz atpases, which are specifically devoted to nai- <dig> transport  <cit>  and immunity  <cit>  as members of two distinct abc transporters, were found as membrane-associated proteins over-represented at a-90 h. a similar quantitative trend, although with subtle abundance changes, was observed for lantibiotic cyclase mlbc, which is involved in lanthionine ring formation  <cit> . indeed, mlbf and mlbz were also found in the global proteome analysis dataset at a-90 h , where mlbf and mlbz occur as over- and under-represented species, respectively, thus suggesting a control mechanism for the cellular compartmentalization of the latter protein. in addition, an over-representation of proteins generally related to cell detoxification and protective mechanisms against antibiotic toxicity was revealed. in particular, various atpase components , which are part of abc-type multidrug transporter systems, as inferred by bioinformatics  <cit> , were differentially represented in global and/or membrane proteome analysis at a substages . indeed, these components showed opposite accumulation profiles with the interesting exception of etk <dig>  protein, which was over-represented in both global and membrane proteome analyses.

stress response proteins
a differential representation of stress response proteins, such as trxb and trxa, catalase/peroxidase hpi, siroheme synthase, globin, uspa and phage shock protein a , was observed at a substages in global and/or membrane proteome analysis . these proteins are generally induced as result of various environmental challenges . in particular, an over-representation at a-90 h was observed for trxb, siroheme synthase, globin, and uspa. pspa and hpi showed discordant and inverse accumulation levels in the whole/membrane bacterial extracts during nai- <dig> production, being pspa modestly-increased/decreased and hpi modestly-decreased/increased, respectively. these results suggest a differential compartmentalization of these proteins. in the case of pspa, the compartment-dependent accumulation profile may be related with its dual role as regulatory element and membrane component, similarly to what already observed in e. coli  <cit> .

comparative proteomic analysis between d substages characterized by different profile of nai- <dig> yield
the d stage is characterized by a decrease in the amount of bacterial biomass compatible with cell growth arrest and cellular lysis occurrences . however, surviving cells are still metabolically active and use medium peptides as carbon and nitrogen source. this can be inferred from the progressive increment of the ph value of the medium , as consequence of amino acid utilization and ammonia production , and by the nai- <dig> concentration that increases until d-140 h . in order to shed light on the molecular events associated with nai- <dig> production maintenance and arrest, differential proteomic analysis was carried out on biomass samples collected at d- <dig>  d- <dig> and d-162 h substages, using d-117 h as pivotal time-point. this analysis revealed  <dig> differentially represented spots in the d- <dig> vs d-140 h comparison, with  <dig> and  <dig> ones over- and under-represented at d-117 h, respectively ; on the other hand,  <dig> differentially represented spots were observed in the d- <dig> vs d-162 h comparison, with  <dig> and  <dig> ones over- and under-represented at d-117 h, respectively. hundred and fifty-one spots were in common between the two datasets showing concordant abundance profiles in terms of up- and down-regulation . thus,  <dig> spots were then subjected to ms analysis for protein identification. identified proteins were clustered according their function as reported above . proteins occurring in spots  presenting the concomitant presence of multiple components  were excluded from clustering. functional analysis revealed that proteins with unknown function were the most represented group  of differentially regulated species, followed by that of species involved in carbon and protein metabolism . the two datasets showed a concordant profile and distribution into functional groups of over- and under-represented protein species . these results univocally revealed that proteins belonging to all functional groups were mostly over-represented at d-117 h ; conversely, an opposite trend was observed for proteins with unknown function . in particular, proteins involved in protein biosynthesis, folding and turn-over, stress response factors, transport through membranes , and enzymes active in nucleotide, energy and carbon metabolism  were accumulated at d-117 h . global accumulation pattern of these functional groups well paralleled the fact that mycelial cells stopped growth at d substages, with the occurrence of concomitant events of cell lysis which became more severe after d-140 h, thus determining the dramatic decrease of biomass content and nai- <dig> production yield as observed thereafter . interestingly, a number of proteins or specific metabolic/molecular processes already observed as over-represented at a-90 h confirmed their positive association with the progression of nai- <dig> production in the d stages, resulting over-represented at d-117 h with respect to d-162 h or to both d- <dig> and d-162 h substages. prototype examples are: i) cell wall biosynthesis/maturation ; ii) lipid modification ; iii) nitrogen metabolism ; iv) oxidative  and osmotic stress response ; v) nai- <dig> transport across membrane, ; v) abc-type multidrug transporter systems  .

construction and characterization of a tetr over-expressing microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> strain
a transcriptional regulatory protein of the tetr family  was observed as slightly over-represented at a-90 h, and progressively accumulating during the bacterial cultivation . tetr family proteins generally act as transcriptional repressors; in the streptomyces genus, they have been reported as being involved in many physiological processes  <cit> , including antibiotic production  <cit> . the relationship between the accumulation of the tetr-like transcriptional regulator and microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> physiological differentiation was analysed through the construction of a tetr over-expressing microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> strain by using the pij <dig> plasmid containing a thiostrepton-inducible promoter upstream the corresponding cloning site  <cit> . in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  over-expression of this gene promoted both morphological - i.e. formation of white aerial mycelium - and physiological differentiation – i.e. increased antibiotic production - , thus confirming its important role in the progression of the microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> life cycle.

evaluation of nai- <dig> impact on microbispora growth physiology
the differential proteomic analyses performed in this study on wt strain revealed a pattern of accumulation of stress response proteins, including those involved in oxidative, osmotic and/or cell envelope-integrity stress response, in coincidence with nai- <dig> production. in order to assess if this phenomenon could be directly imputable to nai- <dig>  a null mutant for nai- <dig> production , constructed by mlba disruption  <cit> , was exposed to an externally-added nai- <dig> amount during growth. in particular, the rp <dig> strain was incubated in kv <dig> medium, where the absence of nai- <dig> was verified by lc-ms analysis. then, nai- <dig> was added to rp <dig> strain cultivations in coincidence with glucose consumption . chosen nai- <dig> concentration  was similar to that observed for wt strain at the end of the a stage . exposition of the bacterial cells to the lantibiotic for 24 h and thereafter resulted in mycelial cell lysis, as inferred by the decrease in the corresponding biomass content, in comparison with untreated cultivations . the nai- <dig> effects on microbispora mycelium were evaluated by differential proteome analysis and confocal microscopy analysis coupled with differential fluorescent staining, as described in the following two sub-paragraphs.

effects of the nai- <dig> addition on the proteomic profile of microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> rp <dig> strain
rp <dig> strain biomass samples were collected at 96 h of incubation from either nai- <dig> exposed and unexposed cultivations  and then processed for differential proteomics. additional file 7: table s <dig> and additional file 6: table s <dig> report the identification of the differentially abundant protein species; description and representations of overall results of this analysis are in additional file 4: supplementary results section, and in figs. 2e and 3e, respectively. by cross-checking global proteomic data obtained from the experiments on microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> wt strain at a-66 h vs a-90 h  and on nai- <dig> exposed vs unexposed rp <dig> strain, worth mentioning was the observation of  <dig> proteins  which have a concordant accumulation profile . their quantitative trend well paralleled with the lantibiotic presence in the medium . among them, proteins over-represented in presence of nai- <dig> are two atpase components of the abc-type multidrug transporter systems , cfa enzyme and pspa protein above mentioned.

effects of the nai- <dig> on cell membrane permeability
by using confocal microscopy coupled with differential fluorescent staining, a quantitative evaluation of the relative amount of damaged  on total  mycelium was provided in the wt strain at different time points . in particular, a progressive increment of the relative amount of damaged mycelium was demonstrated during progression of nai- <dig> accumulation , with a maximum observed at d-140 h  that preceded the further and pronounced decrease of biomass content due to cell lysis . this result confirmed a change in the membrane permeability that well paralleled with the accumulation of stress response factors therein, as revealed by proteomics. the fact that the alteration of the membrane structure was associated with nai- <dig> presence was demonstrated by differential staining using confocal fluorescent microscopy on microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> rp <dig> strain after exposure to nai- <dig> . in fact, red intensity levels of nai-107-treated rp <dig> cultures were similar to those of wt during nai- <dig> yielding stages, while untreated cultivations did not show membrane permeability alterations at the same incubation time .

discussion
in this study, proteomic investigations were carried out on microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  the producer of the promising lantibiotic nai- <dig>  in particular, a total of  <dig> gene products, participating into  <dig> molecular/metabolic functions, as inferred by a kegg orthology and links annotation  analysis  <cit>  , were identified and associated with nai- <dig> production onset and maintenance during bacterial growth.

the nai- <dig> production onset coincided with a pronounced decrease of glucose amount in the growth medium. at the molecular level, this phenomenon was associated with a down-representation of enzymes involved in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and of proteins involved in dna replication, amino acid and protein biosynthesis; conversely, protein degradation factors as well as tca cycle enzymes were instead over-represented during nai- <dig> production at a-90 h . interesting exceptions of the general trend of down-regulation of anabolic pathways at a-90 h were some over-represented enzymes involved in cell wall precursor biosynthesis. the glucose limitation signal may be responsible for a metabolic imbalance that results in the observed over-representation of oxidoreductive processes and oxidative stress response proteins . in addition, the nutrient stress may be a triggering factor that, through the ppgpp activity , can sequentially activate the bld cascade, as deduced by the accumulation profiles of the microbispora bldk, bldg and bldd proteins. in agreement with this view, a stimulation of nai- <dig> biosynthesis has been recently demonstrated in microbispora corallina by the over-expression of rela, whose product is responsible of ppgpp biosynthesis  <cit> . worth mentioning is the fact that the presence of bldk suggests the involvement of cell density signals too  <cit> , which may integrate nutrient availability signals. thus, in parallel with what already observed for the biosynthesis of the morphogenetic lanthionine containing peptide sapb in s. coelicolor  <cit> , the bld regulatory cascade can promote the activation of pathway-specific mlb genes that control the production of nai- <dig> in microbispora. in line with these observations, products of the mlb cluster - i.e. abc transporters mlbf and mlbz, together with lantibiotic cyclase mlbc - accumulated in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> during nai- <dig> production at a-90 h. interestingly, mlbf, mlbz and mlbc were identified as associated with bacterial membranes, thus confirming the possibility that lantibiotic biosynthesis and self-immunity mechanisms occur in proximity of this bacterial district, as already reported in the case of nisin  <cit> . indeed, proteomic analysis of the membrane extracts identified specific proteins, such as pspa, which shifted their quantitative representation moving from the cytosolic to the membrane district. these results confirmed also previous observations on cytosolic translational effectors in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, for which a “moon-ligthining” activity was claimed  <cit> .

interestingly, the metabolism of nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur resulted important for nai- <dig> production onset. evidences of the importance of pi for nai- <dig> production have recently been reported  <cit> . in this study, the pi content in the medium was observed as decreasing and reaching its minimum in coincidence of nai- <dig> onset at a-90 h ; then, it progressively increased during the d stage. this last evidence may be a consequence of two different and partly simultaneous events consistent with: i) mycelial cell lysis during the d stage - as inferred by several experimental evidences such as biomass content kinetics , fluorescent confocal microscopy observations , the accumulation of osmotic and membrane-associated stress response factors  and overall diminished representation of primary metabolism enzymes during the transition from a to d stages  - leading to the progressive release of cellular phosphate; ii) the scavenging action for phosphate from organic sources by pho regulon gene products  <cit> , whose members were observed as accumulating during nai- <dig> production at a-90 h . this last occurrence well paralleled the po consumption profile . on the other hand, the ammonia content profile suggests an equilibrium between production/assimilation of ammonia from medium peptides  <cit> , according with the activity of the glna enzyme  <cit>  that was up-regulated at a-90 h . this equilibrium appeared as interrupted in coincidence with glucose exhaustion during d substages. ammonia metabolism seems to play a crucial role also during nai- <dig> production maintenance at d substages, due to the accumulation profile of two glna paralogues and of glnk . altogether, these evidences suggest that nai- <dig> biosynthesis is mainly supported by the supply of general and essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur. this is in good agreement with the fact that nai- <dig> is a ribosomally synthesised lanthipeptide containing all the proteinogenic amino acids except phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamine and histidine as can be inferred from the amino acid sequence of the precursor peptide encoded by the structural gene mlba.

an interesting finding from comparing a and d substage proteomes was the increasing abundance of a tetr-like regulatory protein. the over-expression of this tetr-family regulator exerted a stimulatory effect on morphological and physiological differentiation in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  as reported for the first time in this study. although further studies are necessary to elucidate which regulatory circuits control the expression of this regulator and which genes are regulated by its activity, this result confirm the powerfulness of differential proteomic-based approaches to reveal regulatory factors playing crucial role in actinomycete biology.

another common aspect that characterized a and d substage proteomes is the evidence of a positive correlation between nai- <dig> production and the stimulation of cellular processes involved in nai- <dig> transport, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation, lipid modification, stress response and multidrug resistance mechanisms. their up-regulation during nai- <dig> production suggests that, beside having mlb specific genes associated with self-immunity  <cit> , microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> genome contains a number of additional genes whose increased expression possibly diminish/prevent the potential detrimental effects due to this lantibiotic. a similar phenomenon was described in s. coelicolor during the metabolic switching that leads to secondary metabolism activation  <cit> , and also emerges from studies on other actinomycetes producing antibiotic metabolites  <cit> . this can be related to the general responses exerted by bacterial strains in circumstances where they are exposed to antibiotics  <cit> . worth mentioning is the fact that bacillus subtilis in exponential growth phase, when exposed to nai- <dig>  showed the over-representation of proteins that coincide with or are strictly related to the molecular processes here described for microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  <cit> .

accumulation of factors that may help maintaining the integrity and stability of the cell membrane, i.e. cfa that catalyzes the cyclopropane ring formation in phospholipid biosynthesis  <cit> , further confirms that nai- <dig> can alter membrane district integrity by binding to bacterial lipid ii  <cit> . although no a real pore-forming mechanism can be claimed to justify the nai- <dig> activity  <cit> , the nai- <dig> capacity of modifying bacterial membrane permeability was highlighted here by confocal microscopy observations coupled with differential fluorescent staining. confirmatory results for the involvement of cellular factors involved in the response to membrane permeability alterations and of abc-type multi drug transporter systems as additional self-resistance mechanisms were finally obtained from the rp <dig> strain proteomic analysis performed by comparing nai-107-exposed cultivations with unexposed ones. this analysis allowed identifying proteins directly induced to face the presence of nai- <dig> in the medium. thus, analogously to other holistic studies realized on antibiotic producing or non-producing bacteria  <cit>  the data obtained from differential proteomic analyses in this study for microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> strains suggests that antibiotics generally do not affect only proteins directly involved in drug binding, trafficking or metabolism, but also components that have no apparent relation with the bioactive molecules itself. altogether, these findings reveal the existence of a well-conserved antibiotic bacterial resistome  <cit>  that can in turn support the function of signalling molecules besides inhibitors in a dose dependent manner  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work reports the first proteomic study of the poorly investigated actinomycete microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> that produces the promising lantibiotic nai- <dig>  patterns of protein accumulation/decrease during microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> growth provided a sharp and net contribution to the elucidation of the complex molecular, metabolic and regulatory pathways controlling physiological differentiation and eventually leading to nai- <dig> production onset and maintenance. integration of proteomic data with gene ontology results, fluorescence microscopy assays and analyses carried out on wt and genetically engineered strains allowed drawing a schematic representation of the regulatory pathways occurring in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> . the data reported in this study will contribute to the development of an efficient production process for nai- <dig> through the application of rational genetic engineering approaches  and/or fermentation technology improvements . it further supports the relevance and the powerfulness of proteomics in revealing novel players of antibiotic biosynthesis regulation in actinomycetes.fig.  <dig> signalling systems and regulatory cascades potentially controlling the physiological differentiation in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  red and green characters, highlighting molecular/metabolic processes in the corresponding boxes, stand for positive and negative association with nai- <dig> production, respectively, according to the data reported in this study. continuous and dashed lines stand for relationships inferred from this study and hypothetical ones based on scientific literature, respectively. lines ending with arrow and black circle tips represent stimulatory and inhibitory relationships, respectively
