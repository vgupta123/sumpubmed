BACKGROUND
orthosiphon stamineus benth.  is a medicinal herb widely distributed in southeast asia. leaves of this plant are commonly used in southeast asia and europe as herbal tea. os is used as a traditional medicine for treatment of some angiogenesis- related diseases such as rheumatism, tumorous edema, obesity, diabetic retinopathy and psoriasis  <cit> . research on os has increased recently due to its various pharmacological properties such as diuretic and hypouricemic  <cit> , hepatoprotective  <cit> , anti-hyperglycemic  <cit> , antioxidant and antimicrobial  <cit> , antiapoptotic  <cit> , antiangiogenic and anticancer effects  <cit> . pharmacological effects of os are attributed to presence of polyphenolics, glycosides, lipophilic flavones  <cit> , rosmarinic acid  and caffeic acid derivatives, triterpenes  <cit> , and diterpens  <cit> . the lipophilic flavones of os including sinensetin , eupatorin  and 3′-hydroxy- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4′-tetramethoxyflavone   have been given considerable interest as markers of pharmacological activity by several researchers  <cit> . however; these lipophilic compounds suffer poor aqueous solubility which limits the os oral bioavailability and therapeutic applications. the os ethanolic extract is rich in the lipophilic flavones such as eup, sin and tmf while containing very low concentration of proteins and polysaccharides. therefore, improving solubility of the lipophilic flavones may improve the bioavailability and hence the overall pharmacological activity of os extracts.

liposomes are artificial vesicles formed by one or more concentric lipid bilayers separated by water compartments  <cit> . they have a unique ability of encapsulating hydrophobic, hydrophilic and amphiphilic compounds  <cit> . drugs with varying hydrophobicities can be encapsulated in the phospholipid bilayer, in the entrapped aqueous core, or at the bilayer interface  <cit> . liposomal drug delivery systems have several advantages such as improving solubility, bioavailability and efficacy, reduced toxicity, and increased product stability and patient compliance  <cit> . phospholipids from soybean lecithin are widely used in liposomal drug delivery systems due to their safety, and wide availability at relatively low cost for upscale production. crude soybean lecithin contains 65–75% phospholipids, together with triglycerides and smaller amounts of other substances such as carbohydrates, pigments, sterols and sterol glycosides  <cit> . the major phospholipids in soybean lecithin are phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylethanolamine , and phosphatidylinositol   <cit> . liposomes of herbal extracts or isolated compounds are usually prepared in pure phospholipids  <cit> , or in crude phospholipid extracts  <cit> . however, the cost of pure phospholipids is a limiting factor in upscale production of liposomal drug delivery systems particularly those containing herbal extracts or dietary supplements  <cit> . it was estimated that one kilogram of pure natural phospholipids costs around  <dig> euro  <cit> , whereas the cost of crude soybean phospholipids is only 5% of the pure one, which makes unpurified soybean phospholipids a good alternative and attractive choice.

this study sought to produce a cost effective nano liposomes of os ethanolic extract in crude soybean phospholipids obtained from food grade soybean lecithin, in order to improve the extract’s solubility and permeability as major factors for improving oral bioavailability. the liposomes were prepared by the film method and were evaluated for solubility, entrapment efficiency, stability under various ph conditions, critical micellar concentration, particle size and zeta potential, ftir spectroscopy, tem, drug release, absorption through everted rat’s small intestinal sacs, and free radical scavenging effect.

RESULTS
analysis of soybean phospholipids and os extract
the crude soybean lecithin was found to contain 62 ±  <dig> % acetone insoluble phosphatides, and hplc analysis indicates phosphatidylcholine  is the main phospholipid ingredient in the phospholipids prepared . the percentage of pc  in crude soybean phospholipids, soybean phospholipid extract prepared in ethanol , soybean phospholipid extract prepared in acetone , and phospholipid fraction prepared by column chromatography  was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 42%, respectively.

phytochemical analysis of os extract revealed presence of high content of phenolics  and glycosaponins . uv–vis spectrum showed maximum absorption at  <dig> and 286 nm , and hplc analysis  revealed presence of ra , eup , sin  and tmf .

optimization of preparation method
selection of phospholipids to extract ratio
the optimum phospholipids to extract ratio was selected based on the improvement in aqueous solubility of os extract. at first, the formulations were prepared using ph-et phospholipid extract at various w/w ratios with os extract. solubility of nonformulated os extract  was determined by uv–vis spectrophotometry and was found to be 956 ± 34 μg/ml. the formulations were prepared by mixing ethanolic solution of the extract with chloroform solution of phospholipids followed by evaporation of solvents and hydration of the resulting film. aqueous solubility results showed significant improvement in formulations prepared at phospholipid: extract ratio of 50: <dig>  150: <dig> and 100: <dig> . the formulation prepared at 100: <dig> w/w ratio showed the highest improvement in solubility; therefore this formulation was selected for further optimization.

p 
results are shown as av ± sd, and the p value was calculated by one way anova with dunnett’s post hoc test versus extract’s solubility in water .

selection of solvent to dissolve the os extract
at the beginning ethanol was selected to dissolve the extract since os ethanolic extract is used in this study. however, solubility results of formulated extract were not very encouraging. therefore, methanol was used to dissolve the extract. aqueous solubility results showed substantial improvement of os extract from 1402 ± 66 μg/ml  to 3979 ± 139 μg/ml  . a possible explanation of these results is that chloroform evaporates  at higher rate than ethanol , leaving behind an ethanolic solution of the extract and causing precipitation of phospholipids, leading to phase separation and the formation of a non-homogeneous mixture of extract and phospholipids. on the other hand, chloroform and methanol evaporate at almost the same rate due to the narrow difference between their bp  leaving behind a homogeneous film of the extract and phospholipids. consequently, this made the water dispersion of the mixture much easier and lead to substantial improvement in solubility.

selection of phospholipids extract
three formulation types were prepared in  <dig> phospholipid extracts including ph-et, ph-ac, and ph-fr. the formulations were prepared at phospholipid: extract ratio of 100: <dig>  and using methanol to dissolve the extract. aqueous solubility was determined by uv–vis spectrophotometry, and the highest solubility  was obtained in the formulation prepared in ph-et phospholipid extract. formulation prepared in ph-ac phospholipid extract showed a solubility of 2997 ± 367 μg/ml, and the lowest solubility was obtained when ph-fr phospholipid fraction  was used  . therefore, the final formulation was prepared in ph-et phospholipid extract that was used in all subsequent analysis.

hplc analysis of os liposomes
hplc analysis of  <dig> marker compounds and  <dig> unknown compounds revealed significant improvement in their aqueous solubility compared to that obtained in non-formulated extract  .

results are shown as average peak area  ± sd .

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
ftir spectra of soybean phospholipid, os extract, and os liposomes were studied in order to get insights into occurrence of interaction between os extract and phospholipids . in ph-et phospholipids extract the broad band centered at 3387 cm− <dig> represents the oh stretching, the principal bands at 2854 cm− <dig> and 2924 cm− <dig> correspond to the symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching in the ch <dig> groups of alkyl chains, the strong band centered at 1741 cm− <dig> corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the ester carbonyl groups, the band centered at 1650 cm− <dig> is assigned to c = o stretching, and the scissoring vibrations of the ch <dig> groups are represented by the band at 1465 cm− <dig>  the characteristic phosphate group vibrational band assigned to the po2− anti-symmetric stretching mode is centered at 1232 cm− <dig> and the po2− symmetric stretching mode po2− at 1075 cm− <dig> , these results are similar to previously reported results  <cit> . in os extract, the broad band centered at 3385 cm− <dig> corresponds to oh stretching, vibrations at 2924 cm− <dig> and 2854 cm− <dig> correspond to c-h stretching, the bands centered at 1695 cm− <dig> and 1607 cm− <dig> correspond to stretching vibrations of carbonyl groups, the bands at 1600–1420 cm− <dig> correspond to phenyl groups, the bands at 1267 cm− <dig> corresponds to ester carbonyl groups, and the band at 1060 cm− <dig> corresponds to primary oh groups. these results are consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

remarkable changes were observed in the infrared absorption spectra as a result of incorporation of os extract in phospholipids; the broad band corresponding to oh groups is shifted from 3387 cm− <dig> to 3421 cm− <dig>  the c = o bands at 1695 cm− <dig> and 1607 cm− <dig> disappeared, the band corresponding to c = o stretching in phospholipids is shifted from 1650 cm− <dig> to 1634 cm− <dig>  the band at 1267 cm− <dig> is shifted to lower frequency  with much lower oscillation strength, the band at 1232 cm− <dig> disappeared, and band at 1075 cm− <dig> is shifted to 1071 cm− <dig>  the most pronounced spectral changes can be observed in the spectral region corresponding to the polar heads of phospholipids. such changes may represent hydrogen bonding between the polar heads of phospholipids with the hydroxyl groups in os extract. hydrogen bonding can also occur between the keto groups of flavonoids and oxygen groups of phospholipids. hydrophobic interaction may also occur between the flavone’s methoxy groups and the phospholipid tails.

effect of ph on stability of liposomes
stability of the os liposomes at ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  was studied in order to predict their stability in the gastrointestinal tract. agglomeration and precipitation of os liposomes occurred immediately after mixing with pbs at ph  <dig> , but not at ph  <dig> , or  <dig>  or water. the percentage of the soluble fraction , relative to that in water, was 66 ±  <dig> % , 94 ±  <dig> %  and 93 ±  <dig> % . these results indicate that os liposomes are highly stable at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , but relatively unstable at ph  <dig> .

in order to verify whether the agglomeration observed at ph  <dig>  is reversible, the precipitate obtained at this ph was re-dispersed in pbs at ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the precipitate was totally dissolved at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  but not at ph  <dig> . these findings indicate that the agglomeration observed at ph  <dig>  is reversible at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . under git ph, the os liposomes are expected to agglomerate under gastric conditions and re-dissolve under intestinal ph. it is noteworthy that soybean phospholipids and os extract separately did not show any precipitate at ph  <dig> .

entrapment efficiency
os liposomes are unstable at ph  <dig> , a property which was used to study the entrapment efficiency of os liposomes. entrapment efficiency was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . this value is considered satisfactory when compared to published data on liposomal drug delivery systems of herbal extracts or compounds from herbal origin  <cit> . entrapment efficiency of ra, tmf, sin and eup was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, 43 ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively. the average entrapment efficiency  of the known fraction is almost 41%, as measured by hplc. the known fraction of the extract  is only 4% of the total components, and the exact ee of the unknown fraction is unknown and cannot be measured accurately . these two points may help to explain the difference in ee observed. basically, the lipophilic compounds have poor solubility in water, and they have higher tendency to be entrapped in the lipid bilayers of liposomes. whereas the hydrophilic drugs may be entrapped inside the aqueous cores of liposomes, or located in the external water phase  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the unentrapped extract can be removed by centrifugation after acid treatment of the liposomes, or by dialysis method without pretreatment, or can be kept in the formulation. in this study the free extract was kept in the formulation in order to avoid extract loss, and reduce the production expanses.

the n-octanol: water partition
when a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds is partitioned between n-octanol and water, the hydrophilic compounds are distributed in water and the hydrophobic compounds are concentrated in n-octanol layer. since os liposomes have improved the extract’s solubility, it is expected that the os extract will be more concentrated in the aqueous layer. our results show that 40 ±  <dig> % of the non-formulated extract is distributed in the aqueous layer which indicates relatively low hydrophilicity of the os extract. on the other hand, this ratio is increased to 64 ±  <dig> % in the os liposomal formulation, which indicates increased extract’s hydrophilicity.

particle size analysis and transmission electron microscopy 
particle size measurement by photon correlation spectroscopy  indicates presence of structures with dynamic diameter of 153–177 nm with narrow size distribution. zeta potential measurements showed presence of anionic liposomes with a surface charge from − <dig> to −49 mv . the presence and morphology of liposomes were further confirmed by tem which verified the presence of round liposomes of <200 nm. furthermore, the lipid bilayer of the os liposomes can be seen clearly at high magnification .

results are displayed as av ± sd .

critical micellar concentration
the critical micellar concentration  was determined using the fluorescent probe pyrene. the results showed that addition of pyrene to aqueous solution containing os liposomes caused substantial quenching of pyrene’s fluorescence in a dose dependent manner . increasing liposomes concentration also caused a redshift in emission intensity, and the intensity ratio i384/i <dig> of pyrene was increased accordingly. the cmc was estimated from the graph  and was found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml.

in vitro release and antioxidant effect
despite of the immediate dissolution of os liposomes in water, the percentage cumulative release was 62% after 24 h at 37°c and ph  <dig> . on the other hand, the percentage cumulative release of non-formulated extract under the same conditions was 94% . this result gives more insights into stability of the liposomal structures under the test conditions, most likely due to the interaction between os extract and the phospholipid carrier, and consequently leading slow release of the active principles. the released extract was then studied for dpph scavenging effect. the results showed potent scavenging of dpph in both os liposomes and non-formulated extract; however with stronger effect obtained in os liposomes  than in non-formulated extract , p =  <dig> .

absorption through everted intestinal sacs
absorption studies were carried out using everted rat small intestinal sacs under physiologic conditions . intestinal sacs were recovered after 1 h incubation, and the contents were analyzed by hplc. significant improvement in absorption of  <dig> compounds was achieved, with a minor reduction in absorption of rosmarinic acid . the largest improvement was obtained in eupatorin  which showed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  folds increment in the compound’s absorption . these results indicate higher intestinal permeability of liposomal extract than non-formulated extract, which can be explained due to encapsulation in phospholipids, increased solubility, presence of nanoscale liposomes, increased negativity and colloidal stability  <cit> . previous research on anionic liposomes has shown enhancement of colloidal stability and absorption  <cit> , and even with higher cellular uptake rate than neutral and cationic liposomes  <cit> .

results are presented as the av ± sd of absorption ratio of os liposomes  to non-formulated extract  .

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the data presented in this study provide evidence about feasibility of using unpurified soybean phospholipids for preparation of nano liposomes of o. stamineus ethanolic extract. the os liposomes demonstrated significant enhancement of intestinal absorption of the active principles, which can be attributed to the improvement in aqueous solubility and permeability, presence of nanoscale anionic liposomes, and colloidal stability of os liposomes. the sustained release profile along with the improvement in free radical scavenging effect may provide a prolonged protection effect against oxidative stress related diseases. therefore, this study may provide a basic formulation of orthosiphon stamineus ethanolic extract for preparation of oral drug delivery system, and possibly topical delivery systems to the skin.
