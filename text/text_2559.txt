BACKGROUND
human immunodeficiency virus , the virus responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , is one of the major causes of death around the world today. there were  <dig>  million aids related deaths and  <dig>  million new infections in  <dig> alone with over  <dig>  million people living with hiv- <dig> infection . although the use of the highly active anti-retroviral therapy  has significantly reduced the mortality and morbidity of hiv patients by chronically suppressing hiv- <dig> replication, we are far from finding a cure  <cit> . moreover, drug regimens not only come with many drawbacks such as increased malignancies, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus  <cit> . other challenges to haart efficiency are development of latency and drug resistance as viruses mutate and escape from the drug action  <cit> . despite isolated stories about cures for hiv infection  <cit>  and a recent modest success in a clinical vaccine trial  <cit> , a vaccine that can give total protection and a drug that can give complete cure remain to be designed  <cit> .

immune response to the hiv infection consists of a combination of both humoral and cellular immunity  <cit> . furthermore, different immune responses can target the same regions of viral peptides. for example, v3-loop peptides of the env gene can be presented by both class i and class ii major histocompatibility complex  molecules and can be recognized by both cytotoxic t-lymphocytes  and t-helper cells , as well as by neutralizing antibodies  . likewise, a highly conserved region in the gag gene  has been shown to interact with ctl, as well as b and t-helper cells  <cit> . this, in turn, implies that escape changes driven by the selection pressure from one type of the host immune response can also lead to escape from a different immune mechanism . recently, epitope vaccines  against hiv as well as other viruses such as influenza have been suggested as a new strategy to avoid the viral escape from the host immune system as well as to counteract development of resistance against drugs  <cit> . while recognition of epitopes by the host immune system and mounting of immune response against pathogen is important in controlling and prevention of infections  <cit> , mutations in the epitope regions can help pathogens to evade recognition by immune receptors and lead to subsequent escape of host immune system  <cit> . selection by the immune system that promotes amino acid sequence diversification at viral epitopes has been shown to play a significant role in the evolution of different viruses, including hiv- <dig>  siv, hepatitis c virus, and the influenza a virus .

based on the type of recognizing receptors, there are three types of epitopes, namely ctl/cd8+ epitopes , t-helper/cd4+ epitopes  and neutralizing antibody  epitopes. single and multi-epitope vaccines containing ctl, th and ab epitopes have been described  <cit> . inclusion of highly conserved epitopes from different genomic regions in a multi-epitope vaccine has been suggested as a strategy to induce a broader cellular immune response that targets the majority of the virus variants  <cit> . however, identification of good vaccine candidates based on the extent of sequence conservation in hiv is a challenging problem, compounded by the fast mutation  <cit>  and recombination rates  <cit> , overlapping reading frames  <cit>  and overall high degree of sequence divergence among the global hiv- <dig> population  <cit> .

recently, we reported a series of highly conserved, co-occurring ctl epitopes from three different genes  that are frequently found in association with each other and therefore can be considered strong candidates for inclusion in ctl multi-epitope vaccines  <cit> . however, to further improve the vaccine efficiency, the use of adjuvants capable of inducing a strong cellular response and potentially augmenting these responses should be considered , including use of multiple types of epitopes  <cit> . for example, gram et al.   <cit>  recently showed that while the use of immune-stimulating adjuvant caf <dig> induces strong a ctl response, inclusion of a cd <dig> t-helper epitope further improves this ctl response.

thus, this study was focused on identifying strong associations between different types of epitopes from multiple genes in search of potent multi-epitope vaccine candidates. our results identified several highly conserved t-helper epitopes that frequently co-occur with particular highly conserved ctl epitopes and that these epitopes co-occur in the majority of hiv- <dig> genomes of different subtypes and groups as well as circulating recombinant forms. here we report  <dig> unique ctl and t-helper epitope associations  that involve epitopes from  <dig> non-overlapping genomic regions from three different genes, namely, gag, pol and nef. widespread presence of these epitope combinations across highly divergent hiv- <dig> genomes sampled worldwide, including circulating recombinant forms, coupled with a high degree of evolutionary sequence conservation likely reflective of substantial fitness impacts of escape mutations  <cit>  makes them potent candidates for a multi-epitope vaccine.

methods
hiv- <dig> genomic sequence data and sequence alignment
hiv- <dig> sequences in the primary analysis included  <dig> hiv- <dig> reference sequences from the  <dig> subtype reference set of the hiv sequence database , http://www.hiv.lanl.gov), which included full length genomes containing sequences from all nine protein-coding genes, one sequence per patient . amino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments were collected separately for analyses of epitope presence and estimation of nucleotide substitution rates, respectively. these curated alignments were generated using hmmer and verified manually . further details about sequence alignments and selection of reference sequences are available in the hiv sequence database and leitner et al.   <cit> , respectively. this reference set was comprised of  <dig> non-recombinant sequences, including  <dig> sequences from m group ,  <dig> sequences from n and o groups and  <dig> recombinant sequences, with approximately  <dig> representatives for each subtype . we used this reference sequence set because it roughly approximates the diversity of each subtype as represented in the database. inclusion of circulating recombinant forms  that are defined as inter-subtype recombinant viruses identified from more than a single patient and spreading epidemically  <cit> , allowed us to capture those highly conserved epitopes that are shared with non-recombinant genomes and are also present in the majority of the recombinant reference genomes.

hiv- <dig> epitopes
the sets of ctl, t-helper and antibody epitopes were collected from the hiv immunology database   <cit> , the most comprehensive curated source of known hiv epitopes  <cit> . a total of  <dig> linear epitopes were collected, including  <dig> ctl epitopes that were described as the "best defined" ctl epitopes and were supported by strong experimental evidence, as defined by frahm et al.,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> t-helper epitopes and  <dig> antibody epitopes . because of the challenges in identifying primary sequence elements of structurally conserved discontiguous conformational epitopes , conformational epitopes were not included in the study. only the epitopes proven to be immunogenic in human as per the hiv immunology database were used in this study. the overview of epitope mapping techniques and challenges in epitope identification has been described elsewhere  <cit> . although ctl and th epitopes had representation from all nine protein-coding genes, ab epitopes were absent in the vif, vpr, rev and vpu genes. the majority of the ab epitopes  belonged to the env gene, while the pol gene had three and the gag, tat and nef genes had one epitope each  <cit> . it should be noted that because of the high amino acid sequence diversity of the env gene that may differ by as much as 30% between subtypes  <cit> , very few antibody epitopes if at all could be expected to be conserved across a broad range of hiv- <dig> sequences; thus, in this study we primarily focus on ctl and t-helper epitopes. restricting hla allele for associated epitopes are given in table  <dig> as per hiv immunology database and iedb http://www.immuneepitope.org/.

inclusion of epitopes in association-rule mining
in order to identify the most broadly represented epitopes, each epitope sequence was aligned with  <dig> reference sequences and the epitopes present in more than 75% of the reference sequences  were selected for association rule mining. a total of  <dig> epitopes, including  <dig> ctl,  <dig> t-helper and  <dig> antibody epitopes, were present in more than 75% of the reference sequences. among them one ctl and two th epitopes were completely overlapping with other epitopes of the same type without amino acid differences and, thus, were excluded from the association rule mining to avoid redundancy . epitopes of different types that completely overlap with each other without amino acid differences were also included to take into account multi-functional regions . the final set of epitopes consisted of  <dig> epitopes representing  <dig> genes, namely, gag, pol, env and nef, and included  <dig> ctl,  <dig> th and  <dig> ab epitopes  .

identification of associated epitopes
to identify frequently co-occurring epitopes of different types, we used association rule mining, a data mining technique that identifies and describes relationships  among items within a data set  <cit> . although association rule mining is most often used in marketing analyses, such as "market basket" analysis  <cit> , this technique has been successfully applied to several biological problems , including discovery of highly conserved ctl epitopes  <cit> .

the data on presence and absence of selected  <dig> epitopes in  <dig> reference sequences  was used as the input for the apriori algorithm  <cit>  implemented in the program weka  <cit> . because of our focus on the highly conserved epitope associations, the minimum support was set at  <dig>  to include only association rules present in at least 75% of the reference sequences. the confidence was set very high at  <dig>  to generate only very strong associations, i.e., where epitopes co-occur in more than 95% of the sequences, and all generated association rules were exhaustively enumerated and examined. the maximum number of rules identified was set at  <dig> to ensure that all association rules above the support and confidence thresholds are captured. once identified, association rules that involved the same epitopes, but in different order, were "collapsed" into a single "unique" rule   <cit> .

epitope-associations in a worldwide set of hiv- <dig> genomes
to verify whether the association rules identified using a representative reference set reflect associations existing in a worldwide hiv- <dig> population, we examined a larger set of  <dig> hiv- <dig> sequences. this genome set included  <dig> hiv- <dig> sequences from the  <dig> web alignment of the hiv sequence database selected to include full-length gag, pol and nef genes for each genome, as well as  <dig> reference sequences used in the first steps of the analysis. the larger genome set included  <dig> sequences from the m group,  <dig> from the n and o groups and  <dig> recombinant sequences . an epitope-association was considered to be present in a particular genome only if all the epitopes participating in that association rule were present without any amino acid differences.

estimation of the nucleotide substitution rates
to assess the extent of sequence divergence of associated epitopes, the number of synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site  and the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site  were estimated in  <dig> hiv- <dig> reference sequences. each codon was classified as  non-epitope or as epitope region, if the codon was mapped to at least one type of epitope. the epitope regions were further subdivided into  associated epitopes ,  non-associated epitopes , and  all other, variable, epitopes that were excluded from the association rule mining . pairwise dn and ds values were estimated using the nei-gojobori method with the jukes-cantor correction  <cit> . this simple method was chosen because it is expected to have lower variance than more complicated substitution models  <cit> . the mega <dig> program  <cit>  was used, and the standard errors were estimated with  <dig> bootstrap replications.

RESULTS
discovery of epitope associations in  <dig> hiv- <dig> reference sequences
out of  <dig> epitopes included in the initial analyses, a total of  <dig> epitope regions, including  <dig> ctl,  <dig> th and  <dig> ab epitopes, were present  in at least 75% of the  <dig> hiv- <dig> reference sequences and thus were included in the association rule mining. using a high confidence value of 95% allowed us to focus only on the strongest association rules that involve the most frequently co-occurring epitopes. using this stringent confidence cut-off, a total of  <dig> associations involving three types of epitopes belonging to four genes, gag, pol, env and nef, were discovered, of them  <dig> association rules were unique combinations of epitopes . a total of  <dig> epitopes that belonged to  <dig> non-overlapping genomic regions from four genes were found to be involved in these association rules . figure  <dig> shows an example of an association rule involving four epitopes of two types  and three genes .

* there were no epitope associations in the following categories: env only, nef-env, gag-pol-env, gag-nef-env, pol-nef-env, gag-pol-env-nef

$ detailed break-up of number of associations based on epitope type and genes involved is given in additional file 4

the majority of the unique epitope association rules  involved only three to five epitopes, with the largest category comprised of rules with four epitopes , followed by  <dig> associations with five and  <dig> associations with three epitopes, respectively . notably, a significant number of association rules involved  <dig> to  <dig> epitopes . there were only two association rules in which  <dig> epitopes were involved. more details on number of associations based on epitope type and genes involved are given in additional file  <dig>  when gene locations were considered, over 82% of the unique epitope associations included epitopes from both the gag and pol genes, followed by  <dig> % and  <dig> % of associations involving only the gag and only pol genes, respectively. another  <dig> % of unique association rules involved epitopes from the nef gene, of which almost 60% of rules involved three genes, gag, pol and nef, with the remainder distributed mostly between gag-nef and pol-nef associations . there were only five association rules that involved epitopes from the env gene. four of these five were from gag-env and one from pol-env associations. notably, associations with antibody epitopes were limited to these five env association rules, which can partially be attributed to the high degree of sequence divergence among the env sequences that can differ by as much as 30% at the amino acid level  <cit> .

no association rules included all three types of epitopes  and four genes . however, several "multi-type" association rules comprised of two different epitope types  and three genes  were discovered . for example, in the association rule: ghqaamqml  - pkepfrdyv  - klnwasqiy  - flkekggl  , ghqaamqml, klnwasqiy and flkekggl are ctl epitopes from the gag, pol and nef genes, respectively, while pkepfrdyv is a th epitope from the gag gene. overall, there were  <dig> "multi-type" associations involving epitopes from two types and three genes  among a total of  <dig> ctl and th epitopes from the gag, pol and nef genes . these  <dig> epitopes can be mapped to  <dig> different non-overlapping genomic regions  and a single association rule is generally spread across  <dig> to  <dig> of such regions. interestingly, even though the association rule with the maximum number of epitopes in a single rule  involved four non-overlapping genomic regions, it included epitopes from only two genes, gag and pol.

epitope-associations in the reference genome are representative of the global hiv- <dig> population
presence of association rules discovered in the reference genome set was verified by analyzing a larger worldwide set of  <dig> hiv- <dig> genomes . the gag, pol and nef genes in each sequence were concatenated for the purpose of the analysis, and presence of each association rule  was noted. the results showed that most of the epitope-associations were present in the majority of genomes from the global hiv- <dig> population. in particular, out of  <dig> epitope associations involving two different types and three different genes ,  <dig> association rules were present in more than 70% of the hiv- <dig> genomes  . further,  <dig> sequences were also analyzed for the presence/absence of  <dig> individual epitopes participating in the 2t-3g associations. the results revealed that with the exception of a single ctl epitope , all other epitopes were present in over 85% of the sequences .

these results underscore the importance of these  <dig> highly conserved epitope regions, as reflected by their substantial presence across the global population of hiv- <dig>  notably, similar pattern of presence with high frequency was observed when the sets of m group sequences , as well as sets of recombinant sequences , were considered separately. interestingly, the latter group had these epitopes present in at least 80% of all sequences. on the other hand, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> epitopes were present in more than 75% of the sequences when the n and o groups were considered separately, which may reflect both the high degree of sequence divergence between n, o and m groups  <cit> , as well as that the majority of epitopes used here were discovered in m group sequences  and the number of nonsynonymous  substitutions per nonsynonymous site  were estimated in all pairwise sequence comparisons of  <dig> reference genomes. each codon was classified into one of four categories, either as  non-epitope, or as  associated,  non-associated or  variable epitope regions . overall, in all pairwise sequence comparisons and different categories of epitope regions the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site significantly exceeded the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, i.e., ds >> dn  . this indicates that purifying selection plays a significant role in the evolution of hiv including evolution of the epitope regions, which is in agreement with our previous results  <cit> . similar trend of overall ds >> dn  was also observed when sequences of the n and o groups were considered separately. however, because of the high degree of sequence divergence between the three groups due to their independent origin via separate cross-species transmission events  <cit> , we will focus our discussion on the pairwise comparisons of the m group sequences only .

average pairwise number of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  substitutions per nonsynonymous and synonymous site, respectively, estimated at different categories of epitope and non-epitope regions among reference sequences of m group are given.

# standard errors were estimated with  <dig> bootstrap replications in mega <dig> 

* in pairwise t-tests, the null hypothesis of ds = dn was rejected in all four comparisons.

the average dn and ds values for each category of sites obtained from the pairwise comparisons of the reference sequences from the m group are shown in table  <dig>  notably, associated epitopes have significantly smaller dn and ds values than respective dn and ds values at other categories of sites, including non-epitopes  . while significantly lower dn values at associated epitopes can be attributed to strong purifying selection operating to reduce amino acid diversity at these highly conserved epitope regions, in agreement with our previous results  <cit> , the significantly lower ds values indicate that the high degree of sequence conservation exist not only at the amino acid level, but also at the nucleotide level in these associated regions. notably, when we consider correlations between the levels of synonymous and nonsynonymous sequence divergence from different site categories for the same pair of sequences, relatively strong and statistically significant positive correlations  exist between dn and ds values for both non-epitope and epitope regions that were not included in the association rule mining, including variable epitopes, but not for associated epitopes. similar trends are detected using non-parametric correlation . this may be attributed to common factors  influencing evolution of these regions, so that the regions with higher ds values are also likely to have higher dn values. on the other hand, the levels of synonymous and nonsynonymous sequence divergence at the associated epitopes have only weak or non-significant correlation both with each other , as well as with dn and ds values at other regions within the same genomes . these results indicate that the lower ds values at the associated epitope regions are not merely the reflection of the overall lower mutation rates, but rather due to specific selective forces preserving nucleotide sequences in these regions, much like purifying selection operating to maintain amino acid sequences at the same epitopes. although the exact nature of these selection constraints remains to be elucidated, it may be related with the structural constraints at the level of rna structure, including potential regulatory rna elements that are yet to be described in the hiv genome  <cit> . interestingly, when the number of sites characterized as "structured" and "non-structured" in watts et al.   <cit>  study was compared among regions classified as associated epitopes and non-epitopes in this study, the results showed that associated epitope regions tend to harbor a significantly larger proportion of structured than non-structured sites while non-epitopes harbor more non-structured than structured sites . because structured regions are expected to be more evolutionary conserved at the nucleotide level to preserve the ability to form secondary or higher-order rna structures, this is consistent with the overall lower degree of sequence divergence observed among associated epitopes. however, no statistically significant difference was observed when the numbers of structured and unstructured sites were compared between associated epitopes and epitope regions not included in the association rule mining . this can be attributed to a variety of factors, including that the latter epitope category is a heterogeneous mixture of epitopes that are evolving with different rates under different selection pressures  <cit> . likewise, as pointed out by watts et al.   <cit> , while most structures in their studied hiv- <dig> model have been well characterized, some structural rna elements may still require further refinement.

discussion
overall, our results identified a set of strong associations between ctl and t-helper epitopes that co-occur in the majority of the hiv- <dig> genomes worldwide and can be considered strong candidates for multi-epitope vaccine and/or treatment targets. there have been several attempts to design multi-epitope vaccines using different strategies for the epitope selection, which is one of the most important steps in a multi-epitope vaccine design. some studies have suggested computer based epitope prediction methods  for such selection, although accuracy of in-silico methods for "prediction of epitopes" is still debated  <cit> . it has been proposed that a mixture of epitopes representing variable regions or potential escape variants can be used to overcome enormous viral diversity of hiv . indeed, some of the hypervariable regions have been shown to be strongly immunogenic eliciting broad cross-subtype-specific responses  <cit> . on the other hand, such highly variable regions may not account for critical functional or structural features of the virus, while epitopes that are highly conserved among different subtypes are likely to be of functional significance and thus less prone to escape mutations  <cit> . in either case, because of the dynamic nature of intra-patient hiv evolution, the need to achieve a broad immune response can be fulfilled through multi-gene/multi-type approach  <cit> , with t-helper activity playing an important role alongside the ctl response .

our results identified several association rules that not only involved two epitope types and three genes, but also were found in the vast majority of hiv- <dig> genomes analyzed. for instance, the association rule, ghqaamqml  - pkepfrdyv  - klnwasqiy  - flkekggl   was present in over  <dig> %  of the worldwide hiv- <dig> genomes analyzed. among these, the epitope ghqaamqml is restricted by hla alleles from different supertypes, namely, b <dig> , b <dig> , a <dig>  and a <dig>  while epitopes pkepfrdyv, klnwasqiy and flkekggl are recognized by dq <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig>  respectively. notably, many of the associated epitopes harbor other epitopes as sub-sequences that are restricted by yet other set of hla alleles, thus potentially expanding the breadth of epitope recognition across a broad range of host hla alleles. for example, in the association rule involving epitopes glnkivrmy  - pkepfrdyv  - lvgklnwasqiy  - flkekggl , epitope lvgklnwasqiy includes another epitope, klnwasqiy, as its sub-sequence. these two epitopes are recognized by alleles from different class i hla loci, b* <dig>  and a* <dig> , respectively. this not only increases the potential for recognition population-wide, but also increases the likelihood of this region being recognized within the same individual. moreover, recent studies have shown promiscuous binding of ctl  <cit>  and th epitopes  <cit>  in hiv- <dig>  i.e., epitope presentation and t-cell recognition may occur in the context of alternative hla alleles different from the originally defined hla alleles. this further enhances potential population coverage for recognition of the associated epitopes. it is worth noting that the involvement of ab epitopes in association rules described here was quite limited, partly because of the strict presence/absence criteria used in the initial selection of epitopes and association rule mining, as well as the fact that the vast majority of ab epitopes are located within env, a highly variable genomic region. only five association rules included a combination of ab and other epitope types . further, this study did not include conformational epitopes, which form a large number of hiv- <dig> b cell epitopes. however, inclusion of a suitable ab epitope should be considered alongside the associated ctl and th epitopes, although further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms of epitope association and interaction across different types and to identify the most promising ab epitope candidates.

although some individual epitopes have been previously identified as conserved , lack of uniform criterion for defining conservation and use of different subsets of hiv sequences  in different studies make it difficult to evaluate relative extent of sequence conservation. thus, our study provides first comprehensive systematic survey of ctl, th and ab epitopes that are highly conserved and also co-occur together among all subtypes of hiv- <dig>  there are several advantages of using multiple highly conserved epitopes from different genomic locations, such as those represented by association rules, in hiv vaccine. the highly conserved nature of amino acid sequences of these epitopes, along with the signature of strong purifying selection acting at the nucleotide level of the associated epitopes indicates that these associated regions represent functionally critical genomic regions, thus decreasing the likelihood of successful escape mutations. the reasons behind such conservation remain to be elucidated and may be driven by constraints acting on the viral genome itself or restraints due to virus-host interactions. it is likely that such persistently conserved residues indeed comprise structurally or functionally important elements critical for viral fitness, either due to interactions between the associated regions, or due to their involvement with the "outside" interactors. the latter possibility is indirectly supported by the appearance of compensatory mutations that accompany escape mutations and that may be located elsewhere in the protein sequence . further, the structural constraints may also be driven by interactions between regions harboring associated epitopes, direct or indirect. for example, conserved 2t-3g epitopes sprtlnawv  and ghqaamqml  from the 5' end of the gag gene are involved in formation of the secondary structure elements, such as helix i and iv, of the p <dig> capsid protein  <cit> . further, of  <dig> association rules that involve the former epitope, about  <dig> % also include the latter epitope . notably, helix i plays an important role in hexamerization of p <dig> during viral maturation  <cit>  and mutations in that portion of the capsid often give rise to noninfectious viruses  <cit> . likewise, the outside positioning of helix iv in the p <dig> hexameric ring as shown in figure two of li et al.   <cit>  and pdb structure 3gv <dig>  <cit>  suggests it may participate in protein-protein interactions. it is possible that associated epitopes are involved in rna-protein interactions as well  <cit> .

an additional advantage of using the associated epitopes is that even if escape mutations are successful at a particular region, the other regions can still be targeted. moreover, because amino acid changes in these epitope regions are relatively rare, inclusion of these regions in a multi-epitope vaccine can not only provide protection against a broad variety of existing hiv- <dig> variants including many circulating recombinant forms, but can also offer some protection against the new strains that can arise in the near future. most importantly, inclusion of epitopes that are immuno-responsive to different arms of the host immune machinery, such as ctl and th epitope combinations can enable stronger and more efficient immune responses, similar to responses achieved with adjuvant therapies .

thus, our study provides a unique strategy to identify suitable epitope candidates for multi-gene/multi-type vaccines that are both highly conserved across the global hiv- <dig> population and highly likely to co-occur together in the same viral genome in various hiv- <dig> subtypes and thus can be simultaneously targeted by multi-epitope vaccines. some of these conserved epitopes have been included in several recently tested vaccine candidates that showed promising results; however, none have included associated epitopes from all three genes. for example, segments of gag, pol and nef were included in the recent lipo- <dig> lipopeptide vaccine trial that showed t-cell responses in ~50% of vaccines  <cit> , yet it lacked associated epitopes from pol . further, because the included epitopes are already derived from the lists of epitopes with experimentally demonstrated immunogenicity in humans, , many challenges associated with the accuracy of computational epitope prediction  can be avoided. moreover, while sequence conservation does not assure that the epitope will be strongly immunogenic , associated epitopes reported in this study also exhibit a high degree of nucleotide sequence conservation which is not readily identifiable by other tools, such as epitope conservancy analysis tool  <cit> , making them suitable targets for other types of treatments such as rna interference  <cit> .

notably, a high degree of amino acid sequence conservation is not the only factor that influences identification of epitopes as promising candidates. for example, several epitopes included in the association rule mining, namely, pipihycapa , wasrelerf  and rkakiirdy , were not involved in any of the  <dig> associations that we discovered, showing that high conservation at the amino acid level does not automatically translate into involvement in association rules and that other factors are also at play. while it is likely that associated epitopes are harbored in functionally or structurally important domains and thus experience strong constraints due to protein-protein or rna-protein interactions  <cit> , further comprehensive experimental and computational studies are needed to better understand the functional and structural constraints and mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of associated epitopes and evolutionary forces that shape sequence variability of these regions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comprehensive systematic survey of ctl, th and ab epitopes that are both highly conserved and co-occur together among all subtypes of hiv- <dig>  including circulating recombinant forms. several co-occurring epitope combinations were identified as potent candidates for inclusion in multi-epitope vaccines, including epitopes that are immuno-responsive to different arms of the host immune machinery and can enable stronger and more efficient immune responses, similar to responses achieved with adjuvant therapies. signature of strong purifying selection acting at the nucleotide level of the associated epitopes indicates that these regions are functionally critical, although the exact reasons behind such sequence conservation remain to be elucidated.
