BACKGROUND
the lesion environment of the injured spinal cord constitutes an impediment to regenerating axons  <cit> . a number of neurite growth inhibitors expressed in and around the lesion area have been identified, including the myelin-associated inhibitors nogoa, myelin-associated glycoprotein , oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein , ephrinb <dig> and semaphorin4d as well as scar-derived factors such as cspgs, secreted semaphorins, ephrins, slits and wnts . these proteins act through multimeric receptors expressed at the surface of injured axons. functional interference with nogoa or its receptor stimulated the recovery of function after spinal cord lesion  <cit> . neutralizing inhibitory molecules in the injured cord would be an important component of a multifaceted therapeutic strategy to promote axonal regeneration. given the diversity of repulsive proteins, targeting of multiple ligands or their receptors will be required to produce extensive repair after cns trauma. rnai is a relatively new tool to silence gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. shrnas can be used to simultaneously silence the expression of multiple genes  <cit> . we investigated whether this technology could be applied in the cns to render injured neurons insensitive to multiple repulsive signals. as a first step in this direction we explored the feasibility to apply rnai to interfere with the signaling of secreted chemorepulsive semaphorins in vivo.

semaphorins are potent chemorepulsive axon guidance cues. secreted semaphorins are expressed by meningeal fibroblasts invading the spinal cord lesion site  <cit> . the receptor for secreted semaphorins is composed of a semaphorin binding subunit  and a plexin signaling subunit . these receptors persist in corticospinal tract and rubrospinal tract  neurons after injury  <cit> . rubrospinal neurons express npn- <dig> but not npn- <dig>  the signaling component plexina <dig> and the intracellular signaling molecule crmp <dig> are present in rubrospinal neurons  <cit> . following injury of the rst, the expression of plexin a <dig> and a <dig> persist, whereas plexin a <dig> is upregulated and a <dig> is undetectable in the red nucleus  <cit> . thus, this descending motor tract in the spinal cord is potentially sensitive to semaphorins in the lesion core. axon outgrowth is considerably improved when neurons are cultured on semaphorin3a -deficient meningeal cells  <cit>  and axon crossing from an astrocyte to a meningeal cell substrate is enhanced by blocking npn- <dig>  <cit> . recently, an inhibitor of sema3a was successfully used to enhance regeneration and to produce a certain degree of functional recovery of the injured spinal cord  <cit> . interfering with semaphorin-neuropilin signaling would therefore be a promising strategy to overcome inhibition of axonal regeneration.

the potential of rnai-based therapies as well as the utility of rnai for basic research is widely recognized. a persistent question in the field of rnai is how the efficiency and specificity of rnai-mediated knockdown of gene expression can be improved. the development of rnai has been hampered by cellular toxicity, which can be the result of interference with the endogenous mirna machinery, the induction of innate immune responses, and off-target effects  <cit> . here we document our attempts to block semaphorin receptor expression by expressing shrna molecules in neuronal cells in vitro and in the red nucleus and drg neurons in vivo. we show that shrna-mediated knockdown of the semaphorin receptor npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> can be achieved in cultured neuronal cells by lentiviral vector derived shrnas. one of two shrna sequences was effective in aav-mediated knockdown of npn- <dig> in drg neurons in vivo. unexpectedly, aav1-mediated expression of shrnas in the red nucleus resulted in an adverse tissue response and neuronal degeneration.

we conclude that, although this technology has great potential to interfere with multiple inhibitory signaling pathways, the present results illustrate unanticipated problems related to the in vivo delivery of shrna. we discuss a number of solutions that have to be implemented before this technology can be routinely applied to interfere with chemorepulsive signaling following neurotrauma.

RESULTS
efficient in vitro knockdown of npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> by lentiviral delivery of shrna
as a primary screening method to assess knockdown efficiency of endogenous npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> expression levels, f <dig> cells, a fusion cell line derived from of rat embryonal drg and mouse neuroblastoma cells  <cit> , were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding green fluorescent protein  and an shrnas directed against npn- <dig> or npn- <dig> . four days after transduction, total rna was isolated. qpcr analysis revealed that npn- <dig> expression after transduction with two shrna sequences was significantly reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively . western blot analysis confirmed npn- <dig> knockdown at the protein level by showing that expression was reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . two out of seven npn- <dig> shrna sequences successfully reduced npn- <dig> mrna expression to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively .

aav1-mediated overexpression of shrna in the red nucleus results in a dose dependent adverse tissue response and neuronal degeneration
recent data from our lab has shown that lentiviral vectors are suboptimal transducers of rubrospinal neurons. the efficiency of transduction of red nucleus neurons is much better when using aav <dig> viral particles <cit> . therefore, the control shrna and the two shrna cassettes that were effective in knocking down npn- <dig> expression in vitro were cloned in the ptr-cgw aav <dig> backbone . after packaging, the resulting aav <dig> particles mediate both gfp and shrna expression. these vectors were stereotactically injected in the red nucleus of rats. animals were sacrificed  <dig> weeks after the injection and processed for gfp-immunohistochemistry. gfp immunohistochemistry was detected in the red nucleus, demonstrating efficient transduction efficiency. however all animals injected with aav <dig> shrna vectors displayed neuronal degeneration and an adverse tissue response  as compared to the uninjected contralateral nucleus . high magnification photomicrographs consistently showed atrophic morphology of neurons that were transduced with an aav <dig> vector encoding shrna . this adverse tissue response and aberrant cellular morphology was not present in aav1-gfp transduced neurons , indicating that the effect was not due to gfp overexpression or aav transduction per se.

the adverse tissue response was partially alleviated by injecting a  <dig> fold lower viral titer . although more neurons appear to survive under these conditions, many still have an irregular and vacuolar morphology. an alternative strategy to attenuate the level of transgene expression in rubrospinal neurons is the use of aav <dig> particles. previous experiments from our laboratory have shown that both spread and expression levels are reduced when using aav <dig> as compared to aav <dig> vector particles <cit> . when control shrnas were expressed by injection of aav <dig> vectors in the red nucleus, gfp immunohistochemistry showed a confined population of gfp positive neurons within the red nucleus . as expected, aav <dig> mediated gfp expression was lower than the expression levels observed in the aav <dig> injected animals and no shrna induced adverse tissue response was present. however, after injection of aav <dig> expressing npn- <dig> shrnas, no knockdown was observed under these conditions .

aav <dig> mediated knockdown of npn- <dig> in rat dorsal root ganglia
we also studied npn- <dig> knockdown in a separate model often used for neuroregeneration studies, the rat dorsal root ganglia. previous results showed that up to 80% of the drg sensory neurons can be readily transduced by a single injection of aav <dig> packaged viral genomes <cit> . we therefore packaged our npn- <dig> targeting and control shrna vectors in aav <dig> particles and injected this vector in the l <dig> and l <dig> drg of  <dig> adult female wistar rats. three weeks after injection npn- <dig> expression was analyzed by in situ hybridization. in drgs injected with virus expressing the control shrna  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of all gfp positive cells expressed npn- <dig> . one of the two shrna sequences was able to reduce the proportion of npn- <dig> expressing cells to  <dig> % ±  <dig>   while the second shrna was not effective . in contrast to the shrna induced toxicity and aberrant cell morphology observed in the red nucleus, the drg neurons appeared unaffected by the expression of shrnas.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to develop an rnai based strategy to knock down the expression of the class- <dig> semaphorin receptors npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> in neurons of spinal nerve tracts and to employ this methodology to investigate the proposed involvement of these receptors in the failure of cns-axons to regenerate. we have successfully developed shrnas that knock down the expression of both neuropilins in a neuronal cell line. in vivo, aav <dig> mediated expression of the most effective npn- <dig> shrna resulted in knockdown of npn- <dig> in drg sensory neurons. unexpectedly, aav5-mediated expression of a second shrna had no effect. aav1-mediated expression of a control shrna and a npn-2-shrna in the red nucleus resulted in an adverse tissue response, including neuronal cell degeneration. these observations demonstrate that, although this technology would have great potential to interfere with multiple chemorepulsive signaling pathways, unanticipated problems with cytotoxicity currently preclude the routine use of this approach in studies on neural repair in vivo.

selection of shrnas for in vivo use
despite considerable efforts to improve the selection of effective rnai target sequences, including the development of various algorithms  <cit>  and the use of favourable thermodynamic properties  <cit> , several shrna sequences against a particular target mrna need to be screened to obtain efficient knockdown. we initially developed two shrnas for npn- <dig> and seven for npn- <dig> and evaluated their capacity to silence npn- <dig> or npn- <dig> expression in f <dig> cells. both npn- <dig> and two out of seven npn- <dig> shrnas exhibit potent gene silencing following lentiviral vector-mediated delivery to the f <dig> cell line. when using a standard transfection for shrna expression, most shrna sequences are capable of reducing target expression . the decreased effectiveness of lentiviral vector-mediated knockdown could be due to significantly lower shrna expression levels as compared to an expression level achieved using transfection methods. standard transfection methods deliver several hundred thousand plasmid molecules to one single cell resulting in fast-onset high level expression of shrnas. in contrast, when shrnas are introduced by means of lentiviral delivery, the number of genomic copies per cell is reduced by at least  <dig> orders of magnitude. this would result in reduced shrna expression levels and consequent diminished knockdown efficiency of the target mrna.

in vivo studies
the efficacy of the selected shrnas was tested in two neural systems that are widely used to study axonal regeneration: the sensory neurons of the drg and the neurons of the red nucleus that form the rubrospinal tract. work from our laboratory has shown that, as compared to aav vectors, lentiviral vectors poorly transduce sensory neurons in vivo <cit>  and are suboptimal transducers of rubrospinal neurons <cit> . therefore the most effective shrnas were expressed via aav <dig> vectors in drg and via aav <dig> vectors in rubrospinal neurons. we chose these two aav serotypes because we have shown that these are the most efficient aav serotype vectors for these two neuronal populations  <cit> .

despite our preselection of the most effective shrna by lentiviral vector-mediated gene silencing in f <dig> cells, only one of the two selected shrnas was capable to significantly reduce the population of npn- <dig> expressing drg neurons. although the observation that the second shrna is somewhat less effective in vitro may already be an indication that it would be less capable to knock down npn- <dig> in vivo, these observations also demonstrate that a shrna that is effective in vitro not necessarily works in vivo.

aav1-mediated shrna expression in the red nucleus caused an unexpected adverse tissue reaction. three weeks after aav <dig> injection, many of the rubrospinal neurons contain vacuolar structures and have an atrophic appearance. furthermore, there is considerable cell death as shown by the loss of neurons and the acellular granular structure of the tissue at the site of aav injection. this phenomenon is unrelated to the shrna sequence used and is not seen after aav1-mediated gfp expression. it has been reported that saturating the mirna machinery by overexpressing shrnas, inhibits endogenous mirna processing  <cit>  with concomitant adverse effects on the transduced cells  <cit> . in the nucleus, exogenous shrnas can saturate the function of exportin- <dig>  a factor required for nuclear export of pre-mirnas and shrnas  <cit> . this saturation can be reversed by overexpression of exportin- <dig> enhancing shrna and endogenous mirna activity in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . exportin- <dig> expression is relatively low in brain tissue  <cit>  as compared to other tissues, rendering the brain particularly sensitive to exportin- <dig> function saturation. similarly, in the cytoplasm, saturating the endogenous rna induced silencing complex  may interfere with endogenous rnai. the observation that overexpression of the catalytic risc rnase component argonaut- <dig> enhances shrna activity  <cit>  demonstrates that argonaut- <dig> is a rate limiting component in rnai and is therefore prone to saturation. the cytotoxic effects observed here following aav1-mediated delivery of shrnas to the red nucleus appears very similar to the toxicity described before  <cit> . saturation of the endogenous mirna machinery may also underlie these adverse effects since lowering the viral dose, and thus the shrna expression levels, reduced although not completely curtailed the toxic effects.

interestingly, no toxicity was observed after aav5-mediated delivery of shrna to the drg. this could be explained by our observation that, in terms of gfp expression level, aav1-mediated expression in the red nucleus outperforms aav5-mediated expression in the drg. if the same holds true for shrna expression levels, the differential expression levels could explain the difference in toxicity. controlling the shrna expression level by means of viral vector dose <cit> , regulatable promoters  <cit> , tissue specific promoters  <cit>  or the use of mirnas  <cit> , will be important variables for future study and in vivo application of shrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
our data shows that we were able to generate shrna sequences that efficiently knock down npn- <dig> and npn- <dig> expression in a neuronal cell line using a lentiviral vector delivery system. substantial in vivo reduction of npn- <dig> expression was achieved by injection of aav5-shrna in the drg, without clear indication of cellular toxicity. in contrast, aav <dig> mediated shrna expression in the red nucleus triggered an adverse tissue response leading to neuronal degeneration. this cellular toxicity is likely due to high levels of shrna expression resulting in saturation of the endogenous mirna machinery, and has to be resolved for this technique to be routinely used in neurobiological studies.
