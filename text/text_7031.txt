BACKGROUND
glomerulonephritis in dogs has been associated with b. burgdorferi infections  <cit>  and in some studies spirochetes were detected in the kidneys  <cit>  and the urine  <cit> . however some of the authors questioned the relationship of a renal lesion with b. burgdorferi  <cit> ; still others assumed b. burgdorferi to be the causative agent for renal lesions  <cit> . in bernese mountain dogs, a familial glomerulonephritis was reported  <cit> . however, antibodies against b. burgdorferi were found in most dogs, raising the question of whether the occurrence of glomerular disease in bernese mountain dogs is related to an infection with b. burgdorferi or if the breed is predisposed to infections with b. burgdorferi.

the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against b. burgdorferi sensu lato in a well defined population of bernese mountain dogs and to compare this prevalence with data from dogs of other breeds from a similar environment.

RESULTS
dogs
one hundred and sixty bernese mountain dogs and  <dig> control dogs were included in the study. age, gender, hair coat color and breed are depicted in table  <dig>  bernese mountain dogs were significantly younger than the control dogs . gender distribution was the same in both groups . fifty-six of the  <dig> control dogs belonged to  <dig> different long haired large breeds. the remaining  <dig> dogs were mixed-breed dogs with collie, german shepherd and flat-coated retriever as dominant breeds.

the answers to the questions about the environment in which the dogs lived are depicted in table  <dig>  significant differences were found between dogs which lived in a rural or a urban environment and for the percentage of time spent in the woods. a significantly larger number of bernese mountain dogs  lived in rural areas compared to control dogs . looking at the two groups separately, living in rural areas did not lead to a higher prevalence in antibodies against b. burgdorferi compared to an urban environment. the reported percentage of time spent in the woods during walks was significantly higher in bernese mountain dogs with antibodies against b. burgdorferi compared to those without them . in control dogs no significant difference was found .

comparison of antibodies against b. burgdorferi and against leptospires
of  <dig> bernese mountain dogs with antibodies against b. burgdorferi,  <dig>  had antibodies against leptospires as well and of the  <dig> without antibodies against b. burgdorferi,  <dig>  had antibodies against leptospires . of  <dig> control dogs with antibodies against b. burgdorferi there were  <dig>  with antibodies against leptospires. and of  <dig> negative control dogs  <dig>  had antibodies against leptospires .

antibodies against b. burgdorferi and vaccination against lyme borreliosis
four bernese mountain dogs and  <dig> control dogs had been vaccinated against lyme borreliosis. all  <dig> bernese mountain dogs had a positive elisa but only  <dig> had a positive western blot. of the  <dig> control dogs,  <dig> had a positive elisa and a positive western blot and  <dig> were negative on both tests.

discussion
the higher prevalence of antibodies against b. burgdorferi in bernese mountain dogs indicates a breed predisposition. susceptibility in some breeds to a certain infection is known from other diseases. for instance rottweiler, american pit bull terrier, doberman pinscher, pomeranian, and german sheperd dog are breeds at significantly greater risk for parvovirus enteritis than mixed breed dogs  <cit> . the reason is not known. however common ancestry has been associated with this. intense breeding might have led to a decrease in defense against infections. this might also be true for bernese mountain dogs, a breed that is known for intense breeding and that has a narrow gene pool. this is supported by the fact that several diseases are prevalent in bernese mountain dogs such as bleeding tendency, epilepsy, and malignant histiocytosis  <cit> . however no infections have been described so far. in cavalier king charles spaniels a breed that was known to be prone to pneumocystis pneumonia infections, it was found that there was a immunoglobulin deficiency in the affected dogs indicating defect in immunity in these dogs  <cit> . the findings in the present study are unique as infections with b. burgdorferi are not causing disease. furthermore, no immunodeficiency is known in bernese mountain dogs. at the time, b. burgdorferi was associated with glomerulonephritis in bernese mountain dog, no direct relation to the disease could be made. it is possible that the bernese mountain dogs with glomerulonephritis in this study had antibodies against b. burgdorferi because the over all prevalence of antibodies was so high in this breed  <cit> . labrador- and golden retrievers were found to be overrepresented in a group of dogs with distinctive renal lesions attributed to lyme disease and also among seropositive dogs in a survey performed in texas  <cit> , indicating some breed predilection for b. burgdorferi infections. however bernese mountain dogs were not mentioned in the studies.

it is well established that borrelia organisms evade the immune system in different ways and host factors become more important the less pathogen the responsible organisms are  <cit> . in human patients with lyme disease-associated erythema migrans, the carriage rate of leukocyte class ii alleles drb1* <dig> and drb1*0101-dqb1* <dig> was higher in patients with the least pathogen b. burgdorferi genotype  <cit> . the immunologic event causing this association was not known but as drb <dig> alleles are located close to certain major histocompatibility complex-encoded complement genes, it was speculated that variants of these complement genes might be in linkage disequilibrium with the drb <dig> alleles  <cit> . the innate immune response plays an important role in the early response of borrelia  <cit>  but it also plays a role in the development of certain glomerular diseases. dogs with a genetically determined deficiency of complement c <dig> more often develop renal and infectious diseases  <cit> . the occurrence of a complement disturbance would explain the co-occurrence of infection with b. burgdorferi and glomerular disease. however no such disturbance is known in bernese mountain dogs so far.

in one study 5% to 34% of the i. ricinus ticks in switzerland were infected with b. burgdorferi and infected ticks were found in all areas where ticks were collected  <cit> . these figures remained stable in later studies  <cit> . even though owners of control dogs reported more often that they lived in urban areas, the bernese mountain dogs and the control dogs in the present study were kept similar, lived in the same areas of switzerland, were walked in the same frequency and for the equal amount of time in the woods. in addition all tick-infested areas in switzerland harbor infected ticks. based on this bernese mountain dogs did not appear to have a higher risk of tick exposure compared to control dogs. furthermore in a dutch study, prevalence of antibodies were not different between dogs considered at high risk to a b. burgdorferi infection  and those considered at low risk   <cit> . one explanation for this was that the rate of outdoor walking in house dogs was considered higher and this also applies to bernese mountain dogs or other large breed dogs in switzerland. nevertheless bernese mountain dog owners in this study reported that their dogs had attached ticks more often than owners of control dogs and it is known that seropositivity among dogs is positively associated with increased tick exposure  <cit> . however the question whether the dogs had attached ticks more often was not specified and was therefore subject to the individual judgment of the owner. furthermore neither the bernese mountain dogs nor the control dogs which had a high frequency of attached ticks reported, had a significantly higher prevalence of antibodies against b. burgdorferi compared to those which did not frequently have ticks.

a possible reason for the increased exposure of bernese mountain dogs was the dark hair coat. in dark hair it is more difficult for the owner to detect ticks than in dogs with fair hair color. this would allow more time for the borrelia species to move from the tick to the host and infect the dogs  <cit> . in the control dogs it could be shown that the ones with dark hair had significantly more often antibodies than those with fair hair . however, if dark haired control dogs were compared with bernese mountain dogs, it could be seen that they also had significantly less often antibodies against b. burgdorferi compared to bernese mountain dogs even though statistically significant differences in reported tick exposure disappeared. this indicates that hair color is not the explanation for the higher seroprevalence of antibodies against b. burgdorferi in bernese mountain dogs. furthermore it was found that people with white clothing attracted more ticks than people in dark clothing in the same environment over the same time period, indicating that fair hair might even attract more ticks than dark hair  <cit> .

results of serologic tests are not consistent. the specificity of whole cell elisas is limited because of cross reactivity with other organisms  <cit> . even though western blot was performed for the confirmation of the elisa results antibodies of leptospires were measured to rule out cross reaction in the elisa. antibodies against leptospires are known to cross-react with antibodies against b. burgdorferi and it was found that antibodies against leptospires are common in healthy dogs in switzerland  <cit> . results of the microscopic agglutination test  for antibodies against leptospires showed that there was no influence of leptospires on the results of antibody tests for b. burgdorferi. vaccination can influence elisa results  <cit> . in switzerland dogs are rarely vaccinated against b. burgdorferi and in the present study only  <dig> dogs were vaccinated, which did not seem to influence the study results.

there are different ways in which western blot results can be interpreted  <cit> . in the present study criteria were used that were established in europe because european b. burgdorferi strains are different from strains in the usa. also the antibody response of european human patients with lyme borreliosis was found to be variable and more restricted than that in u.s. patients  <cit> . antibody response seemed stronger in seropositive bernese mountain dogs compared to positive control dogs in this study as the reaction in the elisa was stronger. rather than differences in spirochete strains, in duration of the infection or in number of reinfections, differences in the immune response of the hosts are a possible explanation for this finding.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion this study showed that bernese mountain dogs more often had antibodies against b. burgdorferi compared to control dogs. breed predisposition for antibodies against b. burgdorferi has not been reported before. more investigations are needed to evaluate the biological reasons and consequences of infections with b. burgdorferi in bernese mountain dogs.
