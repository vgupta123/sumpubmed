BACKGROUND
the neurohypophyseal peptide vasopressin  is involved in different physiological functions, including stimulation of liver glycogenolysis, contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells, antidiuresis and platelet aggregation . in addition, avp plays an important role as a regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis  <cit> . avp receptors are g protein-coupled and can be divided in three subtypes: v1a, v1b, and v <dig>  encoded in humans by avpr1a, avpr1b and avpr <dig>  respectively . the v <dig> receptor is primarily expressed in the kidney and it controls renal collecting duct water permeability. avpr1a has wider expression and it regulates physiological effects such as vascular cell contraction, glycogenolysis and platelet aggregation. the type 1b receptor is mainly expressed by pituitary corticotropes and it mediates the stimulatory effects of avp on acth release. nonetheless, avpr1b expression has also been described in many brain areas  <cit>  and in different peripheral tissues  <cit> , while recent evidences have indicated that avp can induce glucagone and insulin secretion from isolated rodent pancreatic islets through the v1b receptor  <cit> .

recently, considerable attention has been placed on the role of avp and its receptors in complex behavioral tracts. indeed, variations the avpr1a promoter region have been shown to influence reproductive and social behavior in voles  <cit> , as well as complex behavioral traits in humans such as altruism  <cit> , reproductive attitudes  <cit>  and creative dance performance  <cit> . therefore, different studies  <cit>  have analyzed the evolutionary history of the type 1a receptor in different mammalian species. in comparison, avpr1b has attracted less attention, although data from knock-out mice  indicate that it plays central roles in both behavioral and metabolic systems. its regulatory function on the hpa axis is demonstrated by the reduced levels of circulating acth and corticosterone under both stress and resting conditions in v1br-/- animals  <cit> . these mice also exhibit limited aggressive behavior  <cit>  and reduced ultrasonic vocalizations in different social contexts  <cit> . interestingly, a selective v1b antagonist produces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in rodents  <cit>  and in humans avpr1b variants have been associated with recurrent major depression  <cit> , early-onset mood disorders  <cit>  and panic disorder  <cit> . in line with these findings, the receptor has been proposed as a possible therapeutic target in stress-related disorders  <cit> .

methods
dna samples and sequencing
human genomic dna was obtained from the coriell institute for medical research. the genomic dna of one gorilla and one gibbon was derived from the european collection of cell cultures . all analyzed regions were pcr amplified and directly sequenced; primer sequences are available upon request. pcr products were treated with exosap-it , directly sequenced on both strands with a big dye terminator sequencing kit  and run on an applied biosystems abi  <dig> xl genetic analyzer . sequences were assembled using autoassembler version  <dig> . <dig> , and inspected manually by two distinct operators.

data retrieval and haplotype construction
genotype data for yoruba  and europeans  were retrieved from the seattlesnps website  <cit> . genotype data for  <dig> resequenced human genes were derived from the niehs snps program web site  <cit> . we selected genes that had been resequenced in populations of defined ethnicity including african american , eu, yri and east asians  . in particular, for each niehs gene a  <dig> kb region was randomly selected; the only requirement was that it did not contain any resequencing gap. haplotypes were inferred using phase version  <dig>   <cit> , a program for reconstructing haplotypes from unrelated genotype data through a bayesian statistical method. haplotypes for individuals resequenced in this study are available as supplemental material .

statistical analysis
phylogenetic relationships among primate avpr1b genes were reconstructed by obtaining a tree with use of mrbayes  <cit> . in particular, we run a markov chain for  <dig> million cycles under the hky <dig> model of dna substitution with no rate variation across sites.

the ratio of dn over ds was calculated using codeml in the paml package   <cit> . we used the so-called "free-ratio" model in which dn/ds is free to vary among branches with no variation among sites.

linkage disequilibrium analyzes were performed using the haploview software   <cit>  and blocks were identified through the implemented confidence interval algorithm  <cit> . in particular, marker pairs are defined to be in "strong ld" if the one-sided upper 95% confidence bound on d' is > <dig>  and the lower bound is above  <dig> ; a block is created when if 95% of informative comparisons are in "strong ld".

tajima's d  <cit> , fu and li's d* and f*  <cit>  statistics, as well as diversity parameters θw  <cit>  and π  <cit>  were calculated using libsequence  <cit> , a c++ class library providing an object-oriented framework for the analysis of molecular population genetic data. coalescent simulations were performed using the cosi package  <cit>  and its best-fit parameters for yri, aa, eu and as populations with  <dig> iterations. additional coalescent simulations were computed with the ms software  <cit>  specifying the number of chromosomes, the mutation parameter estimated from the data, and the recombination rate with  <dig> iterations for each demographic model. the other parameters for each model were set as previously proposed  <cit> . estimates of the population recombination rate parameter ρ were obtained with the use of the web application maxdip  <cit> .

the maximum-likelihood-ratio hka test was performed using the mlhka software  <cit>  using multi-locus data of  <dig> niehs genes  and pan troglodytes  as an outgroup. the  <dig> reference genes were randomly selected among niehs loci shorter than  <dig> kb that have been resequenced in the  <dig> populations . the reference set was accounted for by the following genes: eno <dig>  vnn <dig>  mmp <dig>  glrx, chrna <dig>  sult1c <dig>  prdx <dig>  h2afx, odc <dig>  mt2a, retn, cyp4b <dig>  recql <dig>  mcl <dig> and mb. in particular, we evaluated the likelihood of the model under two different assumptions: that all loci evolved neutrally and that only the region under analysis was subjected to natural selection; statistical significance was assessed by a likelihood ratio test. we used a chain length  of  <dig> ×  <dig> and, as suggested by the authors  <cit> , we ran the program several times with different seeds to ensure stability of results. a second multi-locus hka test was performed using the "hka" software distributed by jody hey  <cit>  and the same reference loci reported above;  <dig> coalescent simulations were performed with the cosi package  <cit> . in both cases only neutrally evolving sites were considered.

median-joining networks to infer haplotype genealogy was constructed using network  <dig>   <cit> . estimate of the time to the most common ancestor  was obtained using a phylogeny based approach implemented in network  <dig>  using a mutation rate based on the number of fixed differences between chimpanzee and humans. a second tmrca estimate derived from application of a maximum-likelihood coalescent method implemented in genetree  <cit> . again, the mutation rate μ was obtained on the basis of the divergence between human and chimpanzee and under the assumption both that the species separation occurred  <dig> mya and of a generation time of  <dig> years. using this μ and θ maximum likelihood , we estimated the effective population size parameter . with these assumptions, the coalescence time, scaled in 2ne units, was converted into years. for the coalescence process,  <dig> simulations were performed. a third tmrca was calculated as previously proposed  <cit>  that calculates the average nucleotide diversity between the mrca and each of the chromosomes.

all calculations were performed in the r environment  <cit> .

molecular modeling
the three-dimensional model of the human v1b receptor  was obtained by comparative modelling using the known crystal structure of the closely related bovine rhodopsin  as a template, as provided by modbase  <cit> . the significance of the alignment between target and template sequences is e = 4e- <dig>  the retrieved structure was rendered with firstglance in jmol  <cit> .

RESULTS
avpr1b evolution in primates
as a first step, we wished to gain insight into the evolutionary history of avpr1b in primates; to this aim the two exons  were sequenced from gorilla and gibbon genomic dna, while the gene sequences for additional primate species  were retrieved from public databases. a phylogenetic tree  was produced for the  <dig> primates with the use of mrbayes  <cit> . it is worth noting that the failure to resolve the human-chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy is likely due to the short span of the analyzed region . using the free ratio model we calculated the dn/ds ratio  along all lineages; in all cases low ratios are observed indicating that avpr1b has evolved under purifying selection in primates. calculation of ω for the human-chimpanzee pairwise alignment resulted in a value of  <dig> , comparable to the average value for all human genes   <cit> .

nucleotide diversity and neutrality tests
we next aimed at analyzing the evolution of avpr1b in human populations. we therefore resequenced the two exons of avpr1b and their flanking sequences  in two populations of asian and african american ancestry. additional data referring to yri and eu subjects were derived from the seattlesnps website. the final data set was accounted for by  <dig> individuals belonging to  <dig> ethnically distinct populations. a total of  <dig> snps were identified; among these  <dig> and  <dig> nonsynonymous substitutions were located in exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> , respectively. three synonymous coding variants were also identified .

analysis of linkage disequilibrium indicated that avpr1b lies on a single haplotype block in eu and as, but not in african populations . nucleotide diversity was assessed using two indexes: θw  <cit> , an estimate of the expected per site heterozygosity, and π  <cit>  the average number of pairwise sequence nucleotide differences. in order to compare the values we obtained for the two avpr1b exons, we calculated θw and π for a set of randomly selected  <dig> kb windows deriving from  <dig> genes resequenced by the niehs program in the same population samples; the percentile rank corresponding to exon  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the distribution of values for reference  <dig> kb windows is reported in table  <dig> and indicates that ex <dig> displays high nucleotide diversity in all populations, despite showing a level of human-chimpanzee divergence  comparable to the genome average  <cit> ; the same holds true for ex <dig> when african subjects are considered, while as and eu show no unusual nucleotide variation pattern in this gene region. under neutral evolution, values of θw and π are expected to be roughly equal; for both ex <dig> and ex <dig> this is not verified in most cases  and we therefore wished to investigate whether avpr1b might be subjected to natural selection in humans. widely used neutrality tests include tajima's d  and fu and li's d* and f*  <cit> . dt evaluates the departure from neutrality by comparing θw and π. positive values of dt indicate an excess of intermediate frequency variants and are an hallmark of balancing selection; negative dt values indicate either purifying selection or a high representation of rare variants as a result of a selective sweep. fu and li's f* and d* are also based on snp frequency spectra and differ from dt in that they also take into account whether mutations occur in external or internal branches of a genealogy. since, population history, in addition to selective processes, is known to affect frequency spectra and all related statistics, we performed coalescent simulations for all populations using a model that incorporates demographic scenarios  <cit> . additional demographic models  <cit>  were used for coalescent simulations and the results, which confirm those reported below, are available as additional file  <dig>  also, in order to disentangle the effects of selection and population history, we exploited the fact that selection acts on a single locus while demography affects the whole genome: as a control data set we therefore calculated test statistics for the  <dig> kb reference windows deriving from niehs genes. neutrality tests for ex <dig> were consistent with neutrality for african populations, while marginally significant negative values of fu and li's f* and d* where obtained for eu. in the case of as only  <dig> segregating snps are observed in the region.

in contrast, data for ex <dig> indicate departure from neutrality in most populations  with significantly positive values for most statistics. in line with these findings, dt, as well as fu and li's f* and d* calculated for avpr1b ex <dig> rank above the 95th percentile of the distribution of reference  <dig> kb windows in non-asian populations. these latter results suggest that nucleotide diversity in ex <dig> has been shaped by balancing selection; conversely, the negative statistics observed for eu at ex <dig> can in principle be explained by either purifying selection or directional selection since both processes result in an excess of low frequency variants. fay and wu's h  <cit>  is usually applied to distinguish between the two possibilities. negative h values indicate an excess of high frequency derived alleles, a finding consistent with the action of directional but not purifying selection. calculation of fay and wu's h for eu resulted in a significantly negative value .

a striking feature of these results is the large difference in dt between ex <dig> and ex <dig> we observe in the eu sample. such a marked variation in the allele frequency spectrum is even more impressive in light of the strong linkage disequilibrium between the two exons in europeans . in order to evaluate whether such change in the frequency spectrum might be due to chance alone, we performed  <dig>  coalescent simulations by generating gene genealogies for a  <dig>  kb region ; simulations were performed with the estimated recombination rate for avpr1b and using the cosi package with its best-fit parameters for eu  <cit> . the simulated samples were then treated as the gene and dt was calculated for the first  <dig> bp and the last  <dig> bp . the results indicated the probability of observing a difference in dt values as large as or larger than that we observe for the two avpr1b exons amounts to  <dig> , therefore rejecting a neutral scenario.

under neutral evolution, the amount of within-species diversity is predicted to correlate with levels of between-species divergence, since both depend on the neutral mutation rate  <cit> . the hka test  <cit>  is commonly used to verify whether this expectation is verified. here we applied a maximum-likelihood-ratio hka  test  <cit>  by comparing polymorphisms and divergence levels at avpr1b ex <dig> and ex <dig> with  <dig> niehs genes resequenced in the four populations we analyzed . the results are shown in table  <dig> and indicate that for ex <dig> a reduction in nucleotide diversity versus divergence is detectable in the as sample although the result is not statistically significant. the opposite situation is verified at ex <dig>  a significant excess of polymorphisms being observed in all populations. the mlhka test is relatively robust to demography given its multi-locus comparison framework  <cit> ; still, while this method is conservative in cases of population expansion , population size bottlenecks might artificially result in significant p values  <cit> . in order to evaluate whether this is the case, a second multi-locus hka test was performed using the "hka" software  <cit>  which allows estimation of statistical significance through coalescent simulations. these latter were performed using a previously describe demographic model  <cit>  as above and significant results were obtained for both eu and as ; in both cases the test of maximum cell value  <cit>  indicated avpr1b ex <dig> as an outlier .

the signatures of balancing selection are predicted to extend over short genomic distances  <cit> ; nonetheless we wished to verify that the evolution of ex <dig> is not influenced by the presence of a linked balanced polymorphism located elsewhere. to this aim, we exploited the availability in seattlesnps of resequencing data covering the whole gene and extending  <dig> kb downstream in the intergenic region. we calculated the ratio of both θw and π to human-chimpanzee divergence in sliding windows for yri and eu. as shown in figure  <dig>  a peak in both ratios is observed at ex <dig> in both populations. this peak decays in the flanking intergenic region.

as far as coding variants are concerned, analysis of snps in ex <dig> indicated that the derived gly <dig> allele has risen to high frequency in most populations and is fixed among as. with respect to exon  <dig>  a replacement variant  displays higher frequency in eu and as compared to african populations. similarity to the other avp receptors, avpr1b belongs to the 7-transmembrane receptor family; residue  <dig> is located in the second extracellular loop of the receptor, a region which is believed to be important for the binding properties of these molecules  <cit> , including avpr1a  <cit> . indeed, modeling of the protein  indicated that the  <dig> residue is located in close proximity to asp <dig> and cys <dig>  two residues in close contact with avp  <cit> . with respect to residue  <dig>  it is located in the intracellular c-terminal tail, a protein region involved in molecular interactions with adaptors and scaffolding proteins  <cit> .

haplotype analysis
in order to study the genealogy of ex <dig> and ex <dig> haplotypes we constructed median-joining networks  <cit> . the topology of ex <dig> genealogy indicates that, while african chromosomes are relatively diverged from one another, most asian and european haplotypes are clustered and all carry the gly <dig> allele .

with respect to ex <dig> genealogy, two major clades separated by long branch lengths are evident , each containing common haplotypes. some population differentiation is also present along clade  <dig> since most non-african chromosomes are identical and carry the his <dig> allele, while yri and aa also display common haplotypes carrying the arg <dig> allele.

in order to estimate the tmrca  of the two ex <dig> haplotype clades, we applied a phylogeny-based method  <cit>  based on the measure ρ, the average pairwise difference between the two haplotype clusters. ρ resulted equal to  <dig> , so that using a mutation rate based on  <dig> fixed differences between chimpanzee and humans and a separation time of  <dig> million years   <cit> , we estimated a tmrca of  <dig>  my years . given the low recombination rate in the region, we wished to verify this result using genetree, which is based on a maximum-likelihood coalescent analysis  <cit> . the method assumes an infinite-site model without recombination and, therefore, haplotypes and sites that violate these assumptions need to be removed: in this case, only  <dig> single segregating sites had to be removed. the resulting gene tree, rooted using the chimpanzee sequence, is partitioned into two deep branches . a maximum-likelihood estimate of θ  of  <dig>  was obtained, resulting in an estimated effective population size  of  <dig>  a value comparable to most figures reported in the literature  <cit> . using this method, the tmrca of the ex <dig> haplotype lineages amounted to  <dig>  my . a third tmrca of  <dig>  my was estimated by applying a previously described method  <cit>  that calculates the average sequence divergence separating the mrca and each of the chromosomes; coalescence time is then obtained by scaling this average divergence to the mutation rate obtained from human-chimpanzee divergence in the region.

all tmrca estimates indicate an unusually deep coalescent time, as estimates for neutrally evolving autosomal loci range between  <dig>  and  <dig>  my  <cit> . deep haplotype genealogies might result from both balancing selection and ancient population structure . yet, balancing selection is expected to elongate the entire neutral genealogy, while the effects of ancient population structure are reflected in an increase in the genealogical time occupied by single lineages  <cit> . a possibility to discriminate between these two scenarios is to calculate the percentage of congruent mutations, meaning those that occur on the basal branches of a genealogy  <cit> . when we applied this approach to the ex <dig> genealogy, a percentage of congruent mutations equal to 25% was obtained; this is much lower than previous estimates under a model of ancient population structure, which ranged from  <dig> to 45%  <cit> , indicating that balancing selection rather than population subdivision is responsible for the maintenance of the two clades.

discussion
the interest in the identification and analysis of genomic regions subjected to non-neutral evolution is at least twofold. first, such studies provide insight into the evolutionary history of our species, with special reference to the adaptive events underlying phenotypic changes between humans and primates/hominids. second, these analysis are expected to result in the identification of functional variants, which in turn, might influence disease susceptibility or drug response. analysis of avpr1b evolutionary history in humans might fit both these aims since the gene has been involved in complex behavioral traits in other mammals  <cit>  and it has been associated with psychiatric diseases  <cit> . also, the recently proposed idea  <cit>  of the receptor as a potential therapeutic target in stress-related disorders suggests that the identification of functional variants will be valuable in the field of pharmacogenetics.

here we have analyzed the two exons of the gene and, overall, the data we present suggest that avpr1b has been subjected to natural selection. analysis of ex <dig> strongly suggests the action of balancing selection in african populations and europeans: the region displays high nucleotide diversity, an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles, a higher level of within-species diversity compared to interspecific divergence and a genealogy with common haplotypes separated by deep branches. yet, this relatively unambiguous situation is complicated by the presence of unusual features across ex <dig>  the possibility that a variant in this region has been subjected to directional selection in eu and has reached fixation in as is supported by few observations: the large variance of dt in eu and the significantly negative h value in this same population. yet, population structure and different demographic scenarios can yield statistically significant h values, as well  <cit> . also, few theoretical models are available to evaluate the difference in dt at different loci; by performing coalescent simulations we verified that such a shift in the allele frequency spectrum is unlikely to be due to chance; consistently, previous descriptions  <cit>  of marked dt differences at linked regions were ascribed to natural selection. yet, although the closest upstream gene is located more than  <dig> kb apart, we cannot exclude that variants in ex <dig> are hitchhiking with a distant selected allele. also, the possibility that non-selective forces are responsible for this finding cannot be ruled out and the features we observe might be due to balancing selection acting on exon  <dig>  with ex <dig> being neutrally evolving. although we cannot provide definitive evidence for directional selection at ex <dig>  it is worth mentioning that the gly191arg variant might be a good candidate to represent a functional snp: as mentioned above, it is located in the second extracellular loop, in close proximity to residues involved in avp binding ; support to the possible functional significance of this aminoacid replacement, comes from the observation that mutagenesis of most residues in the second extracellular loop of avpr1a results in altered avp binding properties  <cit> ; also different missense substitutions in the same region of avpr <dig> have been described to be pathogenetic and cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  <cit> . with respect to the possible selection targets in ex <dig>  snps located in the 3'utr  represent possible candidates, although the splitting of clade  <dig> into two haplotype clusters with geographically differentiated distribution suggests that additional variants  might have been subjected to some selective pressure, as well. of course, specific experiments will be needed to verify whether this prediction is verified. similarly, a source of selective pressure must be envisaged to explain our findings. unfortunately not much is known on the function and regulation of avpr1b in humans; moreover, the gene is not covered by any hapmap snp at the moment, so that it is likely to be excluded by most genome-wide association studies. instead, some information about the gene derives from experiments in rodents where avpr1b function is abolished by either genetic manipulation or antagonist administration; these experiments imply the inherent difficulty in translating mouse phenotypes to humans, which is even more complicated in the case of genes involved in complex behavioral traits, as avpr1b is suggested to be. given this premise, different possibilities can be envisaged for selection to act on avpr1b, including its role in response to stress, psychological/behavioral manifestations and metabolic control. this latter aspect mainly refers to the expression of avpr1b in human pancreas; experiments on isolated human islets cells, as well as in rodents, indicate that avp can induce both glucagon and insulin secretion via binding to avpr1b  <cit> . also, v1br-/-mice display insulin hypersensitivity  <cit>  possibly due to altered signaling in adipocytes. the possibility therefore exists that one or more variants in avpr1b have played an adaptive role as thrifty alleles  <cit>  by favoring energy storage in times of low food availability. indeed, long-standing balancing selection at the capn <dig> locus, also involved in insulin secretion and action  <cit> , has previously been demonstrated  <cit> . in both cases long-term fluctuations in environmental conditions and food availability might be regarded as an explanation for the maintenance of balanced polymorphisms. nonetheless, our knowledge on the regulation of avpr1b signaling in peripheral tissues is too limited to allow extensive speculation on this issue. conversely, the role of avp in the stress response is better characterized; in response to stressful stimuli, avp acts synergistically with corticotrophin-releasing hormone  to facilitate acth release, resulting in a consequent increase in plasma corticosterone/cortisol concentration . such avp effect is mediated by avpr1b  <cit>  and acth measurements in mice have indicated that avp plays important roles in response to some acute stressors , as well as in times of chronic stress  <cit> . stress responses have an evident adaptive significance and involve both physical and behavioral strategies, with the signaling pathway of avpr1b being possibly involved in both. besides the reported associations between avpr1b and mood or anxiety disorders  <cit> , evidences that the receptor has a role in behavioral traits come from the observation that blocking its activity in mice  results in decreased aggressive behaviors  <cit> , reduced social interactions  <cit>  and anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects  <cit> . in both humans and animals , behavioral responses can be extremely different among individuals of the same species  and recent observations  indicate the maintenance of different behavioral strategies within populations to be adaptive. frequency-dependent selection is deemed responsible for the coexistence of behavioral types in populations  <cit>  and, in general, social interaction behaviors are thought to have frequency-dependent payoffs  <cit> . frequency-dependent selection is among the possible causes for the maintenance of balanced alleles; it is therefore conceivable that a portion of genes involved in behavioral traits have evolved under a balancing selection regime, avpr1b possibly representing one such example. an alternative and non mutually-exclusive explanation for the maintenance of variability in behavior-related traits is response to changing environmental conditions , which is also expected to result in balancing selection regimes. clearly, different behavioral strategies can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the environment; for example, in unpropitious situations organisms might benefit from down-regulating effort and risk taking, the opposite being true when the environment is more favorable. these explanations have been regarded as possibly supporting an adaptive origin for depression/low mood in humans  <cit> , a condition which has been associated to polymorphisms in avpr1b  <cit> . the evolutionary hypothesis for depression has been highly debated in recent scientific literature  and is based both on the high incidence of this condition in modern populations  <cit>  and on different observations. for example, anxiety can be advantageous in perceiving danger  <cit> , a depressive state correlates positively with harm avoidance  <cit>  and favors disengagement from unproductive efforts  <cit> . obviously, these attitudes are selectively advantageous in some environmental conditions  but not in others. following this line, balancing selection rather than directional or positive selection might be expected at loci which regulate such behavioral traits.

CONCLUSIONS
up to now the evolutionary theory of depression has received few demonstrations. to our knowledge, the one we report here might be the first documented example of a gene involved in mood disorders and subjected to natural selection during human evolutionary history. nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that the two reports associating avpr1b variants to depression/mood disorders identified the same major haplotype as being either protective or predisposing in different population of european descent. dempster et al.  <cit>  suggested that the discrepancy might result from the use of slightly different sets of markers; we analyzed the haplotype structure of the entire gene in eu  and found little support for this possibility. therefore, further studies will be required before a full knowledge can be obtained of avpr1b evolutionary role as well as of its association with mental diseases.
