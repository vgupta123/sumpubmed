BACKGROUND
ecotilling is a fast and easy method to detect rare snps or small indels in target genes in natural populations. it is an adaptation of the tilling  technique that is used to detect point mutations in mutant populations  <cit> . in ecotilling, endonucleases such as cel i are used to cut mismatched sites in the heteroduplex dna formed by hybridization of different genotypes in a test panel. it is a cost effective technology as sequencing is limited to individual genotypes each representing a different haplotype. ecotilling has been used for the characterization of the genetic variability in arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> , musa spp.   <cit> , populus trichocarpa   <cit> , phaseolus vulgaris   <cit> , and vigna radiata   <cit> . furthermore, it has been used for candidate gene-based detection of new alleles conferring resistance to biotic and abiotic stress in hordeum vulgare   <cit> , oryza sativa   <cit> , solanum tuberosum   <cit> . cucumis spp.   <cit>  and solanum lycopersicum   <cit> . ecotilling has not been reported for sugar beet  which contributes to 22% of the world production of white sugar  <cit> .

sugar beets are herbaceous, dicotyledonous plants that belong to the amaranthaceae family . the genus beta is divided into the two sections corollinae and beta, the latter of which is further divided into cultivated beets , wild sea beets  and wild beets   <cit> . within b. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris, four cultivated groups can be distinguished: fodder beet, leaf beet, garden beet and sugar beet. while leaf beets and garden beets show an annual or biennial life cycle, sugar beets and also fodder beets are biennial plants that stay in the vegetative phase in their first year, forming a storage root with a high sucrose concentration of up to 20%. both vernalization and long days are required for stem elongation  and flowering to occur in the second year of growth. vernalization in sugar beet is achieved by exposure to cold temperatures for ten to 14 weeks.

currently, sugar beets are cultivated as a spring sown crop in cool temperate climate regions. seeds are sown in april and the roots are harvested starting in september. the late formation of a closed leaf canopy in spring is regarded as the main factor limiting beet yield  <cit> . one strategy to overcome this is the production of autumn sown winter beets which develop a closed canopy earlier in spring. however, breeding of autumn sown winter beets requires sufficient winter hardiness to survive the winter and a system for bolting control which allows bolting for seed production but represses bolting after winter during crop production  <cit> . with key regulators of flowering and bolting in b. vulgaris recently having been identified  <cit> , bolting control may be achieved by genetic modification which on the one hand allows suppression of bolting after winter for cultivation of beets, but on the other hand enables bolting for seed production  <cit> .

in order to avoid an untimely transition to the extremely cold-sensitive generative phase  <cit>  before or during winter, and to facilitate the accumulation of sufficient resources for reproduction, winter-annual and biennial plants growing in temperate zones require vernalization for induction of flowering. cultivated beets are biennials, whereas annual beets without a requirement for vernalization are frequently observed in wild beet populations  <cit> . the vernalization response in biennial beets is mediated by the flowering locus t  homolog bvft <dig>  which in contrast to the promotive action of ft in arabidopsis functions as a repressor of flowering  <cit> . similar to flc, bvft <dig> is gradually down-regulated during the prolonged cold of winter  <cit> . in annual beets, bvft <dig> is not expressed even in the absence of vernalization and was shown to be negatively regulated by the pseudo-response regulator gene bolting time control  <dig> , formerly referred to as bvbtc <dig> <cit> . this gene is located at the bolting locus b and is a major determinant of the annual growth habit in beet. the dominant btc <dig> allele promotes bolting in annuals in response to long days, whereas biennials carry a partial-loss-of-function allele which is not able to mediate the promotive effect of long days without prior vernalization  <cit> . all cultivated  beet accessions tested were found to carry the same haplotype whereas the vast majority of wild sea beets harbour haplotypes which resemble the btc <dig> allele found in annual reference accessions  <cit> .

several other genes in beet have been identified on the basis of homology to floral transition genes in arabidopsis, including the central regulator of vernalization requirement and response in this species, flowering locus c   <cit> . the flc-like  <dig> gene bvfl <dig> is gradually down-regulated during a prolonged exposure to cold under continuous light  <cit> . constitutive expression of bvfl <dig> in an flc null mutant of arabidopsis significantly delayed flowering, suggesting at least partial evolutionary conservation of function between flc homologs in arabidopsis and beet.

interestingly, flowering time control genes also seem to affect frost tolerance, which is the most important factor contributing to winter hardiness  <cit> . plants can further increase their frost tolerance by a gradual adaptation of the metabolism during a hardening process that occurs at non-freezing temperatures below 10°c. in arabidopsis, frost tolerance is regulated by the c-repeat binding factor  transcription factor family, with plants constitutively overexpressing cbf genes showing an increase in frost tolerance  <cit>  and elevated levels of flc expression  <cit> . deng et al.  <cit>  reported that flc plays a dual role in flowering time control and cold stress response. interestingly, a recent study suggested that the recruitment of a repressive chromatin complex at the flc locus involves the cold-induced expression of a long non-coding rna, termed coldair, from intron  <dig> of flc <cit> .

in the present study, we established ecotilling in b. vulgaris to survey a large panel of cultivated and wild beets for allelic variants of candidate genes for regulators of vernalization requirement and/or winter hardiness. this panel had been phenotyped before for variation in the occurrence of bolting before winter  and survival rates after winter  <cit> . as candidate genes we chose  btc <dig> and  bvft <dig>  because of their known functions in the regulation of vernalization requirement and response in beet, and  bvfl <dig>  because of the regulatory role of its homolog flc in both vernalization and cold stress response in arabidopsis. we found that haplotype variation at the bvfl <dig> locus was associated with variation in bolting rate before winter and survival rate after winter. these data provide the first genetic indication for the function of the flc homolog bvfl <dig> in beet, and are relevant for sugar beet breeding and our understanding of the bolting time control network in beta.

RESULTS
phenotyping and model-based analyses of population structure
in fall  <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> accessions sown in the field in july or august at four different locations, had at least one plant which had started bolting before the first frost. these accessions included two sugar beets , four garden beets , four fodder beets ,  <dig> leaf beets  and eleven wild sea beets  . across all four environments, bolting rates for the  <dig> accessions ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . variation for survival rate survival rate after winter across eight environments in 2008/ <dig> and 2009/ <dig> was described in detail by kirchhoff et al.  <cit> , and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . on average, sugar beet accessions performed best  while fodder beet and garden beet performed worst . the largest variation for survival rate was found in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima followed by leaf beets, whereas sugar beets showed the smallest variation. population structure was analysed by a model-based method using the genotypic data for  <dig> polymorphic aflps detected among the  <dig> accessions. an independent calculation of k was repeated six times for each value of k from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  the log probability l increased sharply from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  but only slowly after k =  <dig> . when k is approaching a true value, l plateaus or continues to increase slightly  <cit> . therefore the structure analysis suggested the presence of three subgroups , where most of the sugar beets  fell in the first group, most of the fodder beets  and garden beets  in the second group, and most of the leaf beets and b. vulgaris ssp. maritima in the third group . to further increase confidence in the k value estimate, we calculated Δk and obtained the highest Δk value  for k =  <dig> .

amplification of candidate genes
for the three candidate genes bvfl <dig>  bvft <dig> and btc <dig> we designed  <dig> primer pairs, of which five primer pairs passed the primer “crash-test” and therefore were suitable for ecotilling. the genomic sequence of bvfl <dig>  was taken from reeves et al.  <cit>  while the genomic sequence of bvft <dig>  and btc <dig>  were taken from pin et al.  <cit> . we adopted a primer pre-screen as described by weil and monde  <cit>  to test for the occurrence of unwanted amplification from single primers prior to the costly synthesis of labelled primers. amplification from the five successfully tested primer pairs resulted in a total amplicon length of  <dig>  bp . the remaining primer combinations were not suitable for ecotilling due to miss-priming and single primer amplification revealed in the primer crash-test .

the gene names, genomic sizes in kilo base pairs , protein domains, sizes of amplicons in base pairs  per gene, primer names and sequences, and the sizes of the amplicons in base pairs  are given. genomic size was defined here as the size of the genomic sequence of a gene from the start to the stop codon plus  <dig> kb each upstream and downstream. the genomic size given for bvfl <dig> refers to the known portion of the sequence. a large part of intron  <dig> was not sequenced  and is not considered here. furthermore, the length of the investigated genomic sequence and the percentage of the open reading frame which was investigated via ecotilling are given.

for bvfl <dig> we could amplify two regions . the first amplicon  covered 977 bp of the promoter, exon  <dig> , and part of intron  <dig>  the second amplicon  spanned a region of 632 bp in exons  <dig> and  <dig> and the intervening intron. these regions were chosen because they contain the promoter region, the region encoding the mads box domain as well as a tgtgat sequence motif  which is associated with transcription factor binding activity. thus, 62% of the bvfl <dig> orf was covered. furthermore, we targeted the first intron, which is known to include a number of regulatory regions in arabidopsis <cit> . for bvft <dig> we amplified a 916 bp region  that extends from the 5'-utr to the 5' region of the coding sequence in exon  <dig>  a second amplicon  spanned 713 bp and was located in exon  <dig> and the 3'-utr . both regions together cover 92% of the orf and were chosen because they contain parts of the promoter and the peb domain . in btc <dig> we amplified a 992 bp fragment  of the conserved response regulator receiver  domain region , which covered 15% of the orf .

genetic diversity, snp densities and haplotype frequencies
across the five amplicons  a total of  <dig> snps were identified among the  <dig> accessions tested by li-cor analyses. eighteen snps were located in introns, while the remaining three snps were located in exon  <dig> of bvft <dig> and in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of bvfl <dig>  the latter snp of which was non-synonymous. the number of polymorphisms varied from gene to gene and had an overall density of  <dig>  snp/kb. the lowest snp density was found in btc <dig> , whereas the highest snp density occurred in fl1b  . the snp allocations and gene structures are shown in figure  <dig>  to evaluate the efficiency of ecotilling in b. vulgaris we estimated the rate of false negatives by sequencing all amplicons in four selected accessions, which resulted in a false negative rate of 5%. sequencing of ft1a, ft1b, fl1a and btc <dig> did not reveal additional snps which had not been already identified by li-cor analyses. for the amplicon fl1b one additional snp was identified after sequencing in a single accession. this snp was not detected for any of the  <dig> accession by ecotilling on the li-cor.

the mean non-reference nucleotide frequencies  for bvfl <dig>  and bvft <dig>  are similar across all accessions tested, but varied between individual b. vulgaris forms, ranging from  <dig>  in garden beets to  <dig>  in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima for bvft <dig>  and from  <dig>  in garden beets to  <dig>  in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima for bvfl <dig> . the mean nnf for btc <dig> over all b. vulgaris forms was  <dig> , and ranged from  <dig>  in fodder beets to  <dig>  in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima. we identified  <dig> haplotypes across all five amplified candidate regions. the numbers of haplotypes ranged from four in amplicon btc <dig> to  <dig> in amplicon fl1b. sixty per cent of the detected haplotypes were rare, occurring at frequencies below  <dig> . the reference haplotype  was the most common in each amplicon, with frequencies ranging from  <dig>  for ft1b_h <dig> to  <dig>  for btc1_h <dig> . the non-reference haplotype frequencies  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  across the amplicons within the distinct b. vulgaris forms . the highest nhf was observed in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima, while garden and sugar beets had the lowest nhf. gene diversity  for each amplicon and within each cultivar group is displayed in additional file  <dig>  ht range was lowest in the amplicon ft1b  and highest in the amplicon fl1a . the highest and lowest diversity for the b. vulgaris forms was observed in amplicon fl1a for b. vulgaris ssp. maritima  and garden beets , respectively. subdividing the  <dig> investigated sugar beet accessions into  <dig> accessions of elite breeding material  provided by strube gmbh & co. kg  and the remaining  <dig> accessions of sugar beet germplasm  revealed a trend towards lower diversity in the amplicons fl1a, fl1b and btc <dig>  while the diversity increased in ft1a and ft1b .

bvfl <dig> sequence variations are associated with bolting and survival rate
based on the q matrix for k =  <dig>  associations with bolting rate, survival rate, and survival rate with bolting rate as cofactor were each significant  for the amplicon fl1a and for the amplicon fl1b . dunnet comparisons revealed that b. vulgaris ssp. maritima accessions with haplotype fl1a_h <dig>  fl1b_h <dig> and fl1b_h <dig> had a significantly higher bolting rate of 55% , 75%  and 11% , respectively, compared to 1% for fl1a_h <dig> and 2% for fl1b_h <dig> . furthermore, garden beet accessions with haplotype fl1b_h <dig> bolted before winter with a bolting rate of 6%  compared to 1% for accessions with the reference haplotype fl1b_h <dig> . dunnet comparisons for survival rate revealed that b. vulgaris ssp. maritima accessions with haplotype fl1a_h <dig> had a significantly lower survival rate of 13%  compared to 39% observed for accessions with the reference haplotype fl1a_h <dig> . by contrast, leaf beet accessions with the haplotype fl1b_h <dig> had a significantly higher survival rate of 37%  compared to 19% of accessions with the reference haplotype fl1b_h <dig> . dna sequences of significant haplotypes of bvfl <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>

discussion
this is the first report of ecotilling applied to b. vulgaris. we established ecotilling based on a panel of  <dig> accessions representing the wild and domesticated gene pool of b. vulgaris. in this panel we successfully screened the allelic variation in three genes that are candidates for regulators of vernalization requirement and/or winter hardiness. as a result we were able to provide a snapshot of the species-wide diversity within these genes. further, we identified haplotypes that are associated with bolting rate before winter and with survival rate, which in turn might be useful for improvement of winter hardiness in sugar beets. our results show that ecotilling is a suitable and cost effective method for allele mining in b. vulgaris.

in most ecotilling protocols heteroduplexed dna is digested by purified cel i endonuclease. instead of the purified enzyme, till et al.  <cit>  and galeano et al.  <cit>  used celery juice obtained from salted out or dialyzed crude celery extract for ecotilling screens of arabidopsis thaliana and phaseolus vulgaris, respectively. we went a step further and used the crude celery extract  without further processing, and observed the same activity as compared to the commercial cel i enzyme surveyor® . also, cce was very stable and kept its activity for weeks even when stored at 4°c. as using cce eliminates the need for special enzyme purification steps like chromatography and specialized laboratory equipment, this increases the cost efficiency of ecotilling. we were further able to show that once suitable primers are designed, ecotilling provides a high throughput method for the analysis of natural nucleotide diversity in b. vulgaris. also, ecotilling is a rather cost effective method. when evaluating li-cor gels, signals can be grouped according to size and pattern, and only a limited number of samples per group need to be sequenced to break down the detected variation to the nucleotide level. this drastically reduces the sequencing costs, in our case by 1/ <dig>  if only snps/haplotypes with effect on the phenotype of interest are sequenced, costs can be further reduced. however, it has to be considered that ecotilling is prone to false negative detection because some fragment sizes are masked by background “noise”, due to miss-priming, or because of weaker fluorescence toward the top of each lane and increasing fluorescence “noise” toward the bottom  <cit> . the false negative rate in our case was 5% which is similar to rates reported in human  <cit>  and banana  <cit>  ecotilling.

the population structure analysis by aflp markers indicates that the b. vulgaris accessions can be grouped into three groups . under consideration of the phenotypic classification of the panel , the three groups can be referred to as a sugar beet group, a fodder beet and garden beet group, and a group comprising leaf beets and wild sea beets. this reflects the evolutionary history of beta and the selection intensity during the past 200 years of beet breeding. a similar structure has also been described by jung et al.  <cit>  and by mcgrath et al.  <cit>  after genotyping with completely different marker systems. both groups report that sugar beets can be clearly distinguished from b. vulgaris ssp. maritima. in our study, a few accessions were classified differently by genotype  than by phenotype . regarding b.vulgaris ssp. maritima this could hint at gene flow from cultivated forms into wild material, either in their natural habitat or during propagation by gene banks. at the same time, classification by phenotype was sometimes ambiguous. for instance ‘patak’ accessions from india , although cultivated, showed a plant habitus whose classification into b.vulgaris ssp. maritima seems more reasonable than classification into any of the cultivated forms. interestingly, both approaches to account for population structure resulted in significant associations of the same amplicons, hinting at the robustness of the results. nevertheless, to account for genotyping errors as a source for putative misclassification by structure, genotypic outliers were removed from the dataset for a further analysis by tassel. these outliers were sugar beet, fodder beet and table beet accessions with an estimated portion of non-cultivated beet genome > 50% and b.vulgaris ssp. maritima accessions with an estimated portion of cultivated beet genome > 50% . in this analysis previous associations were still highly significant .

comparing all five b. vulgaris forms we observed the highest genetic diversity for the investigated genes in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima. this is indicated by a mean nnf of  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  in leaf beets followed by fodder beets , sugar beets  and garden beets . the same trend is observed when looking at the average nhf and ht. our findings are in accordance with jung et al.  <cit>  and fénart et al.  <cit>  who reported a higher genetic diversity in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima compared to sugar beets. as selection results in a loss of genetic diversity, it is not surprising that the genetic diversity in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima appears to be higher not only compared to sugar beet but also in comparison to all four cultivar groups taken together. crop evolution is best understood for sugar beet which has been affected by founder effects as it was derived from a single fodder beet population and also by genetic bottlenecks through introgression of a series of traits from a limited number of genetic resources  <cit> . this explains why sugar beet together with red table beet showed the lowest diversity.

in our study the genetic diversity in sugar beet based on ht ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the single amplicons with an average of  <dig> . these estimates are likely to be upward biased as we could not distinguish between the occurrence of non-reference nucleotides in the heterozygous or homozygous state. nevertheless, gene diversity in our study is lower compared to li et al.  <cit>  and mcgrath et al.  <cit> . however, in contrast to li et al. and mcgrath et al. we estimated the genetic diversity for nucleotide polymorphisms in three genes that may have been under selective pressure. this is especially the case for bvfl <dig> where we estimated ht values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for fl1a and fl1b, respectively, and also for btc <dig> . this could be the effect of selection for bolting resistance to prevent bolting caused by late frosts after sowing in spring. comparing sugar beet elite breeding material with sugar beet germplasm, the genetic diversity turned out to have been further decreased by selection for btc <dig> and bvfl <dig> . at the same time bvft <dig> showed even more diversity in sbebm indicating that this gene is obviously not under selective pressure. this is somehow surprising, as bvft <dig> was shown to play a key role in bolting suppression under non-inductive conditions  <cit> . still, these data have to be interpreted with care, as sample sizes are moderate and the sbebm material represents only one breeding company.

for bvfl <dig>  we were able to detect an association with bolting. four haplotypes of this gene  had a significant effect on bolting rate before winter in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima and/or garden beets. although variation in flc is known to affect flowering time in a. thaliana <cit> , the role of flc-like genes outside the brassicaceae is not well understood  <cit> , and a functional analysis of bvfl <dig> in b. vulgaris, e.g. through mutational or transgenic approaches, is still lacking. effects on bolting rate were not observed for all b. vulgaris forms, which in part may be due to the absence of the divergent haplotypes that affect bolting rate in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima or garden beet. the complete absence of these haplotypes in sugar beet may reflect the breeding history of sugar beet, during which breeders strongly selected against bolting before vernalization  <cit> .

as btc <dig> is known to be a major factor controlling bolting without prior vernalization in beets  <cit> , we expected an effect of btc <dig> sequence variations on bolting before winter. however, this was not observed here. this may be due in part to an underrepresentation of annual btc <dig> alleles in our panel or the fact that the current analysis was limited to a relatively small portion of the coding sequence of btc <dig> , and did not include the promoter. although bvft <dig> is known to respond to vernalization and is down-regulated by cold temperatures, which in turn enables induction of flowering  <cit> , we also did not detect an effect of haplotype variation in this gene on bolting rate. while other reasons for this cannot be excluded, as discussed for bvfl <dig> and btc <dig>  it is also conceivable that possible phenotypic effects of haplotype variation at bvft <dig> are difficult to detect under the environmental conditions present in the current study.

besides significant effects on bolting rate, plants with haplotypes fl1a_h <dig> and fl1b_h <dig> showed a significant impact on survival rate after winter in b. vulgaris ssp. maritima and leaf beets, respectively. a similar effect has been shown before for a. thaliana ecotypes, where a snp in intron  <dig> of flc led to a  <dig> -fold increase in winter survival rates in genotypes carrying a functional fri allele  <cit> . the authors suggested that survival after winter is associated with time to bolting. similarly, we found that the survival rate of truly biennial  leaf beet accessions with the fl1b_h <dig> haplotype was higher  when compared to the reference haplotype fl1_h <dig> . hence, winter hardiness in sugar beet might be improved by introgressing fl1b_h <dig> from leaf beet. interestingly, b. vulgaris ssp. maritima accessions with fl1a_h <dig>  which had a lower survival rate than accessions with the reference haplotype, also showed an increased bolting rate. furthermore, after removal of b. vulgaris ssp. maritima accessions which bolted before winter, the accessions with haplotype fl1a_h <dig> did not have a significant effect anymore. therefore, the lower survival rate observed for this haplotype might be a direct physiological effect of bolting before winter as plants in the generative phase are more frost sensitive  <cit> . however, by using bolting rate as a cofactor in a further tassel analysis, we can exclude that increased frost sensitivity in the generative phase is the mere cause for association of bvfl <dig> with survival rate since this association stayed significant. interestingly, seo et al.  <cit>  reported that transient cold temperatures and overexpression of cbfs lead to elevated flc expression and delayed flowering, suggesting a possible role of flc in cold stress response in a. thaliana and, by analogy, a possible explanation for the detected effect of bvfl <dig> haplotypes on survival rate in b. vulgaris. effects on survival rate could not be observed consistently for both haplotypes throughout all b. vulgaris forms. this may in part be due to the absence of the two haplotypes in some of the other b. vulgaris forms . similar to bolting rate, the absence of haplotype effects on survival rate in some b. vulgaris forms might also be due to the polygenic inheritance of survival rate.

among the snps underlying haplotypes fl1a_h <dig>  fl1b_h <dig>  fl1b_h <dig>  fl1b_h <dig>  and fl1b_h <dig>  two are located in an exon. the snp in exon  <dig> is synonymous, whereas the snp in exon  <dig> is non-synonymous, leading to an amino acid substitution from valine to isoleucine. the other snps identified in bvfl <dig> are silent as they are located in introns, including intron  <dig>  these snps might influence gene function by affecting the transcriptional regulation of bvfl <dig>  as was reported for intronic polymorphisms in flc in arabidopsis  <cit> . also, heo and sung  <cit>  reported that the regulatory non-coding rna coldair is expressed from intron  <dig> of flc. finally, the increase in winter survival rates observed for an allelic variant of flc <cit>  was also associated with polymorphisms in intron  <dig>  as with association studies in general, it cannot be excluded that the functional polymorphisms for the traits investigated are located outside the amplified gene regions and that the snps detected here are merely linked to these polymorphisms.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrates that ecotilling can be successfully employed in b. vulgaris to survey a large panel of plant accessions for allelic variants in different candidate genes. our data also provide the first genetic indication that an flc homolog indeed may also affect flowering time  in a species which is only distantly related to a. thaliana. the above described panel of diverse b. vulgaris forms is an excellent resource to identify allelic variation in additional flowering time control genes such as bvft <dig> or candidate genes for agronomic traits such as stress response and plant architecture. allelic variants identified by ecotilling can be used to introduce new genetic variation into elite beet breeding material.
