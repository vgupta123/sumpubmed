BACKGROUND
crohn’s disease  is a complex, chronic inflammatory bowel disease  affecting between  <dig> –16/ <dig>  persons worldwide, with a higher incidence in the western world. as a multifactorial disease, a variety of genetic and environmental factors play a role in its etiology. genome-wide association studies  and meta-analyses have so far identified a total of  <dig> susceptibility loci for ibd  <cit> , with  <dig> for cd. these gwas loci have highlighted important pathways underlying ibd, such as immunity and autophagy. yet, the identified variants so far explain less than 30% of the cumulative genetic variance for cd and it is thought that a part of the so-called missing heritability may be found in rare variants with larger effect sizes. next-generation sequencing enables the genome- and exome-wide identification of novel variants and is therefore the current method of choice for finding new rare susceptibility loci for complex diseases. in the past 5 years researchers even identified several monogenic forms of severe early-onset colitis. for example, single mutations in il <dig>  and the genes encoding for its receptor  as well as mutations in xiap  have been shown to cause severe early-onset ibd. monozygotic  twins have long served as a model for the influence of environmental factors versus genetic factors , since they are believed to be genetically identical. for example, our previously published german epidemiologic twin study revealed that red meat consumption, high antibiotic intake and living abroad before time of diagnosis, especially in countries of the non-developed world, may play a role in disease etiology  <cit> . moreover, our group identified several differentially methylated sites in the colonic epigenome of discordant colitis twins with functional consequences, i.e. impact gene expression  <cit> . monozygotic discordant uc  twins were also shown to differ in the bacterial composition of their gut microbiota, with the affected twins showing less diversity than their healthy co-twins  <cit> . this suggests an important link between disease and the microbiome.

in the past years it has been repeatedly shown that the assumption of genetically identical monozygotic twins needs to be reconsidered. genetic differences have been discovered between monozygotic twins  <cit> , which can be regarded as an extreme form of somatic mosaicism, describing the presence of two populations of cells with different genotypes having developed from a single fertilized egg as a result of postzygotic alterations of the genome  <cit> . several studies have shown discordant phenotypes between monozygotic twins resulting from genetic differences such as chromosomal mosaicism  or dominant gene mutations  and differences in the copy number profiles of monozygotic concordant and discordant twin pairs were detected  <cit> . these findings challenge the assumption of disease discordance in monozygotic twins reflecting purely environmental effects. the genetic comparison of monozygotic twins discordant for a complex disease has been previously proposed for finding disease-relevant variants in a set of candidate genes  <cit> . during the past years sequencing costs have dropped dramatically, thus allowing for whole genome- and exome-wide comparisons of monozygotic twins, enabling the identification of these rare genetic events without the need for prior assumptions like focusing on certain candidate genes. the genetic comparison of monozygotic discordant twins therefore represents a promising possibility for finding novel candidates for disease susceptibility that may help explain some part of the missing heritability. considering the estimated human mutation rate of ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig> ×10− <dig> per position per diploid genome  <cit> , approximately  <dig> mutations per genome are expected per generation, indicating that genetic differences between monozygotic twins may not be so rare. however, whole genome sequencing and the comparison of monozygotic twins discordant for multiple sclerosis yielded no differences  <cit> . as a consequence, we aimed for a higher sequencing depth  in our study and included samples of the directly affected tissue in addition to blood samples in the sequencing to maximize our chances of detecting relevant somatic mutations.

we here report the sequences of four genomes and eight exomes of blood samples and bowel biopsies from three monozygotic twin pairs discordant for cd, the study setup is illustrated in figure  <dig>  from the german ibd twin cohort described in  <cit>  we chose three twin pairs based on preferably low age of onset, high current age and the availability of blood samples and bowel biopsies . by sequencing different sample types we were not only able to scan for differences between the twins, but additionally search for tissue-specific variants in the bowel tissue directly affected by the inflammation of cd. this is to our knowledge the first characterization of genomes and exomes of monozygotic twins discordant for crohn’s disease.figure  <dig>

all three twin pairs were female and of german ancestry and co-twins grew up together. in all affected twins, the disease showed ileocaecal localization and the diagnosis was confirmed by both endoscopy and histopathology. the first twin pair  was 63 years old at time of recruitment with an age-of-onset of  <dig> in the affected individual. the patient did not suffer from fistula or stenosis but presented with arthritis as an extraintestinal manifestation. so far, no surgery was necessary and flares occurred approximately once a year with few hospitalizations. the second twin pair  was 45 years old at time of recruitment. the affected twin had been suffering from crohn’s disease since the age of  <dig> and presented with anal fistula to the skin and arthritis as an extraintestinal manifestation. she underwent emergency gut surgery due to ileal perforation in the ninth year of disease. the patient was hospitalized approximately once per year since disease onset and has in total spent more than 6 months in the hospital. since surgery, she has no longer been suffering from regular flares. the third twin pair  was 32 years old at time of first participation in the study and showed the earliest age-of-onset of the three twin pairs with only twelve years. the patient presented with fistula  and had been admitted to the hospital less than every two years for a total of one to three months since disease onset. the frequency of flares was one to three per year with few hospital stays necessary. in all twin pairs, the healthy twin showed no signs of intestinal inflammation.

RESULTS
for tp <dig>  four genomes and four exomes of blood-derived dna as well as dna from bowel biopsies were sequenced. from tp <dig> and tp <dig>  blood samples of both twins were exome sequenced, resulting in a total of four genomes and eight exomes from three twin pairs. all samples were sequenced to a minimum average coverage of 36× . in total, more than 500gb of sequences were uniquely aligned for the four genomes, resulting in coverage of more than 93% of the whole human genome reference. this value represents the upper limit of what can possibly be covered, since the female human genome reference hg <dig>  that was used consists to  <dig> % of masked regions. these results are also consistent with previously reported genomes  <cit> . for the exomes, on average over 96% of the targeted regions were covered. the genomes yielded a mean value of  <dig> , <dig> variants, which is in agreement with an estimated human nucleotide diversity of  <dig> %  <cit> . the expected transition/transversion  ratio for genome-wide single nucleotide variants  is  <dig>  and approximately  <dig>  for exons  <cit>  and can be used as an indicator for the quality of snv detection. our genome-wide snvs accurately matched these values, while those for exome-wide snvs ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and were therefore between the recommended values for genomes and exomes. this is to be expected, as the enriched targets do not exclusively consist of exons, but to a large part also include additional regions such as the untranslated regions  of numerous genes. as an additional quality control for our variant calls, we calculated the snv concordance in pairwise comparisons for all twin pairs. greater than 93% concordance was achieved for the genomes of tp <dig> and greater than 99% for the corresponding hiseq exomes. the overlapping genome and exome snvs were more than 93% concordant. the exomes of tp <dig> and tp <dig> showed more than 96% pairwise concordance. these results additionally confirmed the monozygosity of all analyzed twin pairs and suggest an adequate data quality. detailed numbers for the concordance in all datasets are illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes among rare  variants typically ranges between  <dig> and  <dig>  and among common variants between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . for a typical whole genome resequencing project the estimated ratio is between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . our observed nonsynonymous to synonymous ratios between  <dig>  and  <dig>   confirm these observations. the numbers of non-frameshift and frameshift indels and nonsense snvs detected in our study average below those of the  <dig> genomes project  while we detected a slightly higher number of splice-site variants . these deviations may be attributable to differences in data generation or more stringent variant calling. we estimated the number of potentially deleterious and disease-related variants in our dataset by computing the number of variants classified as disease-causing  in the human gene mutation database . even a healthy genome contains between  <dig> and  <dig> dm variants  <cit>  and we observed no excess in our dataset. we detected between  <dig> and  <dig> missense variants predicted to be “deleterious” by sift  <cit>  or “probably damaging” by polyphen <dig>  <cit>  in each of our genomes and exomes. missense variants with a grantham score above  <dig>  representing amino acid changes defined as moderately radical  and radical  have a higher likelihood of clinical consequences. we found  <dig> to 18% of all missense variants to fall into this category. a high phylop value illustrates a strong evolutionary conservation of the affected genomic position and most pathogenic missense variants have been shown to have a phylop score above  <dig>   <cit> . with approximately  <dig>  highly conserved variants the genomes only display approximately four times the number found in the exomes, despite magnitude differences in total size. this is attributable to the higher conservation of exonic regions. as even the genome of a healthy person contains at least  <dig> loss-of-function variants  <cit> , it is difficult to establish a connection between the large number of potentially deleterious variants and a higher susceptibility to cd.

for the reliable detection of differences between co-twins we used three tools in parallel and separately evaluated the results to achieve the highest possible sensitivity and hence lowest false-negative ratio: somaticsniper  <cit>  employs a bayesian comparison of the genotype likelihoods while varscan  <cit>  uses heuristic methods to test the significance of allele frequency differences using fisher’s exact test. they both involve a direct comparison of the alignments of different samples to detect differences and were originally designed for tumor and normal pairs. the third tool pibase  <cit> , previously released by our group, interrogates positions of interest in the alignment and performs a fisher’s exact test incorporating different quality filters based on e.g. mapping quality, base quality and number of unique start points to determine the probability of differences. for tp <dig>  with exome and genome data from blood samples as well as bowel biopsies available, we were able to scan for differences between the twins as well as tissue-specific mutations. for the exome data from the blood samples of tp <dig> and tp <dig>  the comparison between affected and healthy twin was carried out accordingly. the comparison of the top  <dig> calls from the three methods showed only marginal overlap, confirming the results of previous studies  <cit> . a maximum of two variants were called by all three, the highest overlap was found between somaticsniper and varscan with four to  <dig> shared variants . somatic mutations with a p-value below  <dig>  from fisher’s exact test or in case of somaticsniper a somatic score above  <dig>  were manually checked through inspection of the alignments using the integrative genomics viewer . the majority of calls was already excluded at this stage. the false-positives were either attributable to false-negative calls in the healthy sample, mostly due to low quality alignments or low coverage, or they were caused by false-positive calls in the diseased sample, often due to alignment artifacts caused by nearby indels. one example is shown in figure  <dig> where a somatic mutation in the biopsy compared to the blood sample of the affected twin was called by somaticsniper and varscan on chromosome  <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig> marked as “snv2” in the intronic region of erc <dig>  the visual assessment of this region showed the occurrence of a second snv and an insertion nearby in the alignments of the two samples. manual realignment of reads containing one of the three variants each confirmed that the reads could all be aligned by introducing a 19 bp insertion  compared to the reference sequence, confirming identical dna sequences in both samples. for the pairwise comparisons in tp <dig>  where four genomes and exomes were sequenced, the two samples not involved in the comparison were always available for further clarification, e.g. a variant detected in the blood sample of the cd twin and not in the blood sample of the healthy twin is highly unlikely to be a somatic mutation if we can also detect it in the bowel biopsy of the healthy twin. we were additionally able to cross-check exonic mutations from the exomes and genomes of the same samples. in total we visually inspected more than  <dig>  potential somatic mutations for all three twin pairs . following these steps, we excluded all candidates for tp <dig> and selected  <dig> variants from tp <dig> and tp <dig> for validation through sanger sequencing. however, none of the variants could be confirmed as discordant as they were found to be either false-positive calls in one sample or present in both samples.figure  <dig>

for tp <dig> we also performed differential copy number variation analysis. the genomes showed  <dig> cnvs potentially present only in the affected twin after filtering. these were visually inspected in the alignments and compared to the cnvs called for the exomes. the pairwise comparison of exome cnvs from blood samples did not show any region above the filtering cutoffs while the biopsies showed a deletion on chromosome  <dig> for the exome data. however, this region does not show up in the comparison of blood and biopsy of either twin, nor does it show up in the blood comparison or the genomic cnvs, and there are not sufficient snvs to support a loss of heterozygosity  in the region. therefore, none of the observed potential copy number losses or gains differing between twins or tissues showed sufficient support to be deemed of interest for follow-up analysis.

we estimated the genetic susceptibility of the twin pairs to cd by computing the genotypes of the genomes of tp <dig> and also, where available, those from the exomes of tp <dig> and tp <dig> at the identified cd risk loci . the overall risk, represented by the summed up logarithmic odds ratios for the  <dig> cd risk alleles present in the twins, showed a higher mutation load in the three twin pairs in direct comparison to the distribution of the calculated overall risk of  <dig>  healthy individuals genotyped on the immunochip . this indicates that although genetic differences between the co-twins were not detected, a certain proportion of genetic susceptibility may still play a role for the development of cd in the affected twins and the discordance between twins is most likely attributable to environmental factors.figure  <dig>

discussion
we here report the first whole genome and exome sequences of mz twin pairs discordant for cd. we detected no reproducible differences within the twin pairs. based on the good data quality and a high genotype concordance between samples and different methods, our data provided a solid foundation for the detection of somatic mutations between the co-twins. the low overlap between the three used tools for the detection of differences argues against the presence of somatic mutations. we therefore assume a high probability of the analyzed genomes and exomes being truly genetically identical. however, in spite of adequate data quality and the thorough analysis methods, the probability remains that we overlooked existing differences. the samples sequenced for tp <dig> consisted of blood samples as well as bowel biopsies for genomes and exomes. we decided on this approach since it allows for an exceptionally thorough look at the genetic data and offers the unique possibility of identifying tissue-specific somatic mosaicisms, especially in the tissue of interest for the particular disease. but the analysis of biopsy-derived dna also involved a certain trade-off. the low yield of dna extracted from a single biopsy required the pooling of dna from several biopsies for the sequencing. a somatic mosaicism may not have been present in all biopsies used for sequencing and it is unlikely that we would have been able to detect mutations present in only a small fraction of the sequenced samples and if so, validation through sanger sequencing would present another challenge. on the other hand, mutations present only in some regions of the bowel would be rather unlikely to have an effect on the development of crohn’s disease. in the future, this problem may best be handled through the application of single cell sequencing  <cit> , where the resulting genome truly represents the genome of a single cell and not the pool of what may possibly be several mosaics. this also applies to tumor genome resequencing where similar single-cell-based approaches are currently envisioned. for tp <dig>  the biopsies were taken from affected regions in the colon, however the primarily ileocaecal disease localization in the affected twin may be an issue for finding somatic mutations. it is questionable if the affected twin from pair  <dig> represents an ideal candidate for a genetic study. with an age of onset of  <dig>  only a few short hospital stays and no surgery needed so far, the course of the disease is comparatively mild and hence the genetic contribution may be low. however, the availability of the bowel biopsies from both twins considerably limited the number of possible twin pairs. in turn, we chose a lower age of onset and more severe disease course for tp <dig> and tp <dig>  for whom only blood samples were available and subjected to sequencing. the three twin pairs chosen for this project therefore constitute the best possible trade-off between sample suitability and availability.

the theoretical probability that an offspring of a diamniotic mz twin father carries a germline mutation that can be detected by allele-specific pcr in a sperm sample of their biological father, but not of his twin brother was defined at approximately 83%  <cit> . this thought experiment assumes circumstances clearly differing from the situation with our three female twin pairs, but nonetheless this estimated value may give an idea of the probability of finding differences in our twin pairs. essentially, an experimental test of this theory in one male twin pair did detect five differences in genomes from sperm-derived dna  <cit> . only one of these snvs however was also detected in the according blood samples, suggesting much variation in the detectable number of differences, also depending on the tissue type sequenced. in this study we focused solely on the detection of genetic differences between mz twins for finding novel candidates for cd susceptibility. however, several other mechanisms may also be involved in disease discordance. bowel biopsies of mz twins discordant for ulcerative colitis, from the same cohort as in this study, were shown to differ in their dna methylation patterns and exhibit differential gene expression  <cit> , suggesting a role in disease development and yielding several novel candidate genes. for psoriasis, another disease involving chronic inflammation, dna methylation and gene expression data in mz discordant twins showed no differences between co-twins when analyzed separately. however, a combined analysis identified genes where differences in dna methylation between unaffected and affected twins correlated with differences in gene expression  <cit>  and hereby identified several known and novel susceptibility genes. in contrast, sequencing of the genomes of one twin pair and transcriptome sequencing, snp chip and methylation chip data of three discordant twin pairs revealed no differences between co-twins discordant for multiple sclerosis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results are in accordance with previously published results and suggest that it is unlikely that somatic mutations have a substantial impact on the development of crohn’s disease, yet we cannot completely exclude the possibility of having missed existing somatic mutations in the three twin pairs examined. moreover, our study provides an analytical example framework to perform mosaicism detection and hints at potential weaknesses of existing variant detection tools. in the future, systematic transcriptome, methylome and microbiome analyses on mz discordant twins using next generation sequencing technologies are the way forward and can further elucidate the role of differential gene expression and differences in the microbial composition of the bowel in disease discordance.
