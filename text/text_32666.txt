BACKGROUND
continued improvement in sequencing quality, combined with increasingly sophisticated bioinformatic analysis of sequence data, has increased the relevance of whole genome sequencing to many fields of biological science including the pharmaceutical industry, agriculture, national defence and medicine  <cit> . similarly, the increased availability of sequence data has served to support increasingly complex and informative comparative genomic studies. in both cases, the enhanced relevance and power of genomic comparisons have, in turn, furthered demand for still more sequence data, with the goal of comparing entire genomes. although high-throughput sequencing methodologies have been developed to accommodate the demand for sequence output, they consume large amounts of a valuable input: genomic dna. for example, a taq-man based whole genome association study of  <dig>  snps would require approximately  <dig> mg of genomic dna, more than obtained in routine clinical blood samples  <cit> . less input dna is required for a genome-wide, microarray-based survey restricted to known mutations, but even this would require some form of amplification step  <cit> .

other applications also place a high demand on potentially scarce dna. emerging relationships between specific genotypes and risk factors or disease states have focused attention on dna samples that are of great medical/scientific importance, but of limited supply, such as tumor samples, lavages, buccal swabs, or samples generated by laser capture microscopy  <cit> . while laser capture offers single cell accuracy and both lavages and swabs permit minimal patient invasion and discomfort, these methodologies produce far less genomic dna than less precise, more invasive techniques  <cit> . some inherently rare samples, such as difficult to culture micro-organisms  <cit>  or genes from an individual bacterium  <cit>  are of great scientific interest, but cannot be sequenced by current technologies without pre-amplification  <cit> . considerable interest also exists in sequencing low abundance dna from museum or fossil specimens, although amplification of these samples must address issues of degradation  <cit>  and contamination  <cit> . high rates of consumption, combined with high demand from the scientific community, may result in hard decisions restricting access to these limited or irreplaceable samples.

whole genome amplification  can potentially eliminate dna as a limiting factor for genetic assays. however, in order to fulfil this role, wga must satisfy some basic requirements. first, the amplification process should be highly accurate, so as to avoid introducing an undue number of errors. second, amplification should not induce a bias in the distribution of the product dna. third, a high amplification factor is required, so that the wga generates a useful amount of dna from small starting samples. finally, the wga method should be applicable to a wide array of genomes. for maximal efficiency, the wga protocol would be universally applicable, without need for separate optimization for each sample. in this paper we will address the latter three points – bias, yield, and applicability to two different genomes – leaving the more complicated studies of both amplification fidelity and the sequence-specific causes of bias for another time.

three primary forms of wga have been developed: multiple displacement amplification   <cit> , primer extension preamplification   <cit> , and degenerate oligonucleotide primed pcr   <cit> . these wga methods have been compared in previous papers, but these comparisons have been limited in scale. the authors either scanned individual nucleotide mutations for snp analysis, or used comparative genomic hybridization  or fluorescence in situ hybridization  to scan large regions of the genome  <cit> . in the snp analyses, the comparison is at a high resolution, but small in scope, while for cgh and fish, the comparison is at a low resolution , but large in scope. the different methodology resolutions can therefore report differing levels of bias, as described in a recent study of ϕ <dig> fidelity using both direct sequencing and array hybridization of  <dig> snps  <cit> . while array-hybridization results revealed whole genome amplification-related loss of  <dig> regions  and under-representation of another  <dig> regions, snp calls from amplified dna were not statistically different from those of unamplified material  <cit> . ideally, any comparison of wga methods would investigate amplification bias across entire genomes at the highest resolution possible.

for this paper, we have used mda, pep and dop to amplify two bacterial genomes, halobacterium species nrc- <dig> with a relatively high 66% gc content  and campylobacter jejuni with a single, 31% gc content chromosome. after making libraries of the resultant amplified genomes, we sequenced the libraries using the  <dig> sequencing system  <cit> , and enumerated reads initiating within various sized windows of the respective genome, with a maximum resolution of  <dig> bases across the entire length of the genome. we then conducted sequence-based karyotyping on the amplified and control genomes, and were thus able to generate a high-resolution comparison, encompassing both coding and non-coding regions, of the coverage bias induced by wga methods across complete bacterial genomes.

RESULTS
amplification yield
dna samples were assayed by uv absorption at  <dig> nm to determine their concentration after amplification. the amount of input dna was held constant at  <dig> ng for all methods. averaged across both genomes, genomiphi generated  <dig>  μg of dna, a 640-fold amplification, repli-g amplified input dna  <dig> fold to  <dig>  μg, pep generated  <dig>  μg, a 120-fold increase, and dop amplified the input dna 92-fold to  <dig>  μg.

data analysis
for each amplification method, sequencing reads that mapped to the target genome at 95% or greater accuracy were pooled from three or more individual sequencing runs. the percentage of sequences that mapped to the genome varied depending on the amplification method utilized: roughly 60% of the unamplified and mda amplified reads mapped at 95% accuracy or better, while 40% of the pep and 20% of the dop samples mapped to their target genomes. the number of pooled, mapped reads for each of the amplified samples exceeded  <dig> , while the number of pooled control reads was approximately  <dig> , <dig> for each genome, reflecting the larger number of samples drawn from these pools to assess variability within the controls.

analysis populations composed of  <dig>  unique reads, their start position , read length  and their orientation  on the reference genome were randomly sampled from each of the pooled sequences from amplified genomic material. five separate analysis populations were generated from each of the control sequence pools to determine the degree of variation within the unamplified reads. following the generation of the analysis populations, the total genome coverage in bases was determined for each population and both genomes, and the percent of total coverage calculated for each in table  <dig> 

the gc content of the sequenced reads was determined for each genome and amplification methodology. the fasta files generated for each of the one hundred thousand reads resulting from each amplification method were analyzed for gc content, and the mean gc content and standard deviation for each method was calculated. welsh's two sample t-test was employed to compare the mean gc content from each test population against the reference population for each genome. the 95% confidence interval around the difference between the means, and the corresponding p-value were recorded in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the sequencing results for both genomes were also analyzed for the type and size of homopolymers covered in the sequencing and summarized in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

the reference genome was then subdivided into bins of a specific number of bases, and the number of reads that started in each bin was recorded for every population. additionally, the relationship between coverage depth and the presence of minichromosomes or genomic repeat regions was examined for  <dig> base genomic bins . for the purposes of this paper and this sequencing technology, genomic repeats were defined as regions which were 95% identical across  <dig> bases. the genomic location of the repeat regions relative to the counts per  <dig> base bins from unamplified halobacterium and c. jejuni controls is shown in figure 3a and 3b.

for each sample, the number of reads initiated in each bin was compared to the number found in the same bin of the respective unamplified control. the ratio of the two numbers was computed for each bin, and the maximum  and minimum ratio  were recorded in table  <dig>  as an identical number of reads were used for each sample, the average numbers of reads obtained per bin were identical for each treatment, requiring a more sophisticated statistical assessment to accurately assess potential bias.

the empirical cumulative frequency distribution  of the reads per bin for halobacterium and c. jejuni are shown in figures 4a and 4b respectively. the ecdf represents the cumulative distribution of the number of counts per bin, reporting the cumulative proportion of bins with counts equal or less than the value on the x axis. it was expected that the counts per bin would follow a poisson distribution, and some bins in each sample would doubtlessly contain outliers. to address relative bias we wanted to compare differences between the read distributions obtained for each sample, rather than comparing each sample to a model distribution. as a result, the non-parametric, distribution-free kolmogorov-smirnov test  with its associated d-statistic was used for subsequent analysis.

the kolmogorov-smirnov test  and d-statistic
the ks-test was employed to assess the deviation between the number of counts per bin that occurred between two genomes , using the maximal deviation  between the cumulative count distributions of the populations being compared . the d-statistic for each comparison reported the maximum deviation between each sample's cumulative distribution of counts per bin across the entire genome, revealing the greatest extent of distortion or bias relative to the reference distribution. by comparing several test distributions  to a single reference, the relative amount of deviation or bias could be determined.

for each genome in this study, the distributions of reads per bin were compared between the five unamplified controls with a ks-test to test for significant variation within the control group. one of the unamplified populations was selected at random to serve as a control, and the distribution of counts per bin from the other four unamplified samples were compared to this. in every case no significant difference  was discovered between the control and unamplified replicate populations . for subsequent comparisons unamplified replicate # <dig> was chosen  as the control against which the amplified distributions were compared. the d-statistics associated with the control and amplified genomes were then ranked from lowest to highest creating a hierarchy of amplification bias relative to the unamplified reference population.

to ensure that the trends were consistent, the bin size for each genome was increased, effectively decreasing the number of bins and increasing the number of reads per bin, and the process repeated. four different bin sizes, ranging from  <dig> bases to 1/100th of the full genome size were used for each organism; the results for halobacterium species nrc- <dig> and campylobacter jejuni are summarized in tables  <dig> & <dig>  a graphical summary of the number of reads per  <dig> base bin for the different sample populations relative to the unamplified control genome can be seen in figure 5a for halobacterium and figure 6a for c. jejuni.

discussion
amplification yield
the yield of the various whole genome amplification techniques, averaged across both genomes, shows clear differences in the amount of dna generated by the different methodologies. although other methods exist , we chose uv spectrophotometry quantification due to the need to detect both single and double stranded dna, and the fact that all of the dna had been purified prior to quantitation, thereby removing the excess nucleotides and primers. it is theoretically possible that some of the hexamer primers may have carried through the sodium acetate precipitation step used in the mda reactions. however, we do not feel that this unduly influenced the yield reported for the mda reactions as the od <dig> method was suggested in the genomiphi product manual, and the mda yields we produced were not excessive.

each reaction started with  <dig> ng of input dna, repli-g generated a  <dig> fold amplification of the input dna, genomiphi 640-fold, ipep 120-fold and dop amplified the starting material 92-fold. sharp contrasts are evident between the yields derived from mda-based  amplifications versus pcr-based  approaches; these can be attributed to the differences between the highly processive strand displacement activities of ϕ <dig>  the polymerase used in both mda reactions, and the taq-like enzymes used in the pcr based reactions. due to the strand displacing capabilities of ϕ <dig>  mda reactions do not require repetitive cycles of denaturation and annealing temperatures. in pcr reactions these cycles limit polymerase longevity and activity; the half-life for various taq polymerases ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes at 95°c, resulting in a 50% or greater decrease in enzyme activity at the end of  <dig> cycles  <cit> . by utilizing isothermal reactions the mda methods are able to preserve enzyme functionality for a full  <dig> hour reaction, and generate substantially more dna in the process by a hyperbranched mechanism  <cit>  of dna amplification. it is interesting to note the difference in yield between the mda methods; it is likely that the use of the koh alkali denaturation prior to amplification used in the repli-g process is more efficient at opening potential priming sites than the thermal denaturation used in the genomiphi protocol. this is in general agreement with findings that the quality of sanger-sequence data from mda-amplified templates improved after alkali denaturation  <cit> , and increased pcr yields following naoh, as opposed to thermal, denaturation of a high gc genome  <cit> .

genome coverage
the percent of genome coverage varied considerably by genome and amplification methodology . the unamplified samples, both reference and all unamplified replicates, covered similar expanses of the target genomes, obtaining  <dig>  to  <dig> % coverage of halobacterium species nrc- <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig> % of campylobacter jejuni. as the halobacterium species nrc- <dig> genome is  <dig>  times larger than campylobacter jejuni  it is not surprising that  <dig>  reads complete relatively less of the larger halobacterium sequence. however, the substantial difference between the 85% completion of halobacterium and the 99% campylobacter jejuni completion obtained from the unamplified samples requires additional explanation. analysis of the number of reads per halobacterium chromosome reveals that the number of reads per  <dig> base bin is disproportionately high for both pnrc <dig>  and pnrc <dig>  than for the main chromosome nrc <dig>  . the over-representation of the minichromosome reads even in the unamplified samples may simply reflect a greater abundance of the smaller chromosomes relative to the main chromosome; pnrc <dig> is a multicopy chromosome  <cit> , and the same might be true for pnrc <dig>  additionally, a significantly higher percentage of the halobacterium genome is comprised of repeat regions , and the smaller halobacterium chromosomes contain a higher incidence of repeats than the main chromosome . the repeat regions are disproportionately heavily sequenced relative to their frequency, encompassing 14%, 89% and 75% of the control reads from nrc <dig>  pnrc <dig> and pnrc <dig> respectively . the relative over-coverage of the repeat regions results in fewer of the  <dig>  reads covering unique regions, and thus reduces the total coverage of the halobacterium species nrc- <dig> genome. campylobacter jejuni also experiences relative oversampling of the repeat regions, but with far fewer repeat regions and a smaller total genome than halobacterium, total genome coverage is less affected.

total coverage of halobacterium dropped significantly when amplified dna was sequenced, with coverage ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % depending on the amplification process. c. jejuni coverage was more complete for most of the amplified material; genomiphi, repli-g and pep-pcr amplified samples covered  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genome respectively, while dop-pcr only covered 17%. the relatively poor coverage of halobacterium by the wga methods may be due to the presence of the two minichromosomes, and the frequency of repeat regions within them. as mentioned previously, the minichromosomes are more repeat-rich than the main chromosome, there may be relatively more copies of the minichromosomes present in the population relative to the main chromosome, and the smaller chromosomes are more likely than the larger main chromosome to have survived the dna purification process and shipment intact. coupled with the high incidence of repeat sequences in the minichromosomes, this could cause a disproportionate amplification of the two minichromosomes, and corresponding lower sequence coverage of the remaining chromosome.

additionally, as the two minichromosomes have lower gc contents than the main chromosome ; the possibility of preferential, gc-influenced amplification was investigated. for either genome the mean sequence gc content was not significantly different  between the unamplified control and the replicate populations. the control values for c. jejuni were in close agreement with the listed gc content , while the values obtained for halobacterium species nrc- <dig> were slightly lower than the listed values , possibly reflecting both the lower proportional coverage of the genome, as well as inherent difficulty in sequencing strands with high degrees of secondary structure.

the mean sequence gc contents for all wga methodologies were significantly different  from the control gc content for both genomes. deviation from the control gc content was less pronounced for campylobacter jejuni, the low gc genome. sequences generated by genomiphi and repli-g were roughly  <dig> % and  <dig> % more gc rich than the control, respectively, while pep-pcr produced reads that were roughly  <dig> % more gc rich than the unamplified control. in contrast, dop-pcr reads were biased in the opposite direction,  <dig>  to  <dig> % more at rich than the control sequence.

the sequences produced by each of the wga methods were significantly lower in gc than the unamplified halobacterium species nrc- <dig> reference sequence, and the margin of difference was more pronounced than described for c. jejuni. genomiphi sequences were the closest to the control gc content, with roughly  <dig> % lower gc content in the amplified sequence. repli-g was the next highest, with roughly  <dig> % less gc than the control. the two pcr-based methods generated the most biased sequence in terms of gc content: the mean gc content of pep-pcr reads were between  <dig>  and  <dig> % lower than the control, while dop-pcr reads contained  <dig>  to  <dig> % less gc on average.

the relative abundance and size of homopolymer stretches in the target genome could possibly influence genome coverage through polymerase slippage in whole genome amplified samples. the frequency of a, c, t and g homopolymers were calculated separately for each genome and sample. the data were log <dig> transformed to allow an informative scale and resolution and shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> for halobacterium and c. jejuni respectively. while a thorough analysis of the influence of template composition on sequence coverage and amplification is beyond the scope of this paper, the figures illustrate that homopolymer coverage is similar for most samples across all four nucleotides and both genomes. one exception is found in the dop-pcr coverage of c and g homopolymers in c. jejuni , where the frequency of the g and c homopolymers is substantially greater than those in the controls and other amplified samples for homopolymers from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides long.

sequence coverage bias related to mda has been reported in the past. dean et al.  <cit>  detected preferential amplification of puc <dig> from samples containing both plasmid and bacterial chromosomal dna. in their case, however, the puc <dig> plasmid was only  <dig>  kb in circumference, and thus easily circumnavigated by a single ϕ <dig> molecule, which generates an average product of  <dig> kb or greater  <cit> . in our study, however, the size difference between the main and mini halobacterium species nrc- <dig> chromosomes is less dramatic, and all chromosomes exceed  <dig> kb in length, rendering it unlikely that polymerase processivity is the root cause of the increased minichromosomes coverage. it is possible, as suggested by dean et al.  <cit>  that the smaller chromosomes are less likely to suffer nicking and subsequent rca termination than larger chromosomes. as mentioned previously, paez et al.  <cit>  reported selective under-representation and loss from amplified material, raghunathan et al.  <cit> described bias from  <dig> % to 1211% in a qpcr analysis of mda from single e. coli cells, sequence loss related to regional proximity to the ends of both human and yeast chromosomes has also been detected  <cit> , and mda-induced loci over and under representation as high as  <dig> fold has been discovered by qpcr  <cit> . mda amplification of multiple bacterial species within a single sample revealed preferential amplification of  <dig> of the  <dig> species, although all species were represented to some extent  <cit> . in this study, differences in template size, stochastic effects and other factors were thought to be influential  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that in our study none of the previously mentioned possibilities  can fully explain the over-amplification of the mini-chromosomes. should these factors directly influence the relative amplification rate, one would expect pnrc <dig> to display a higher amplification rate than pnrc <dig> as pnrc <dig> is smaller, has a lower gc content, and is substantially more repeat rich . this is not the case; however, as all wga samples provide higher coverage for pnrc <dig> than they do for either pnrc <dig> or pnrc <dig>  as a result, it is impossible to precisely attribute the cause of the bias as uniquely size, copy number, repeat, homopolymer or gc derived, and overamplification appears to be influenced by factors other than those we have discussed here.

internal controls and run to run reproducibility
unamplified halobacterium and c. jejuni dna were made into libraries and sequenced as controls both for comparison to the wga samples and to ensure that any potential systemic bias introduced by the sequencing platform was reproducible from sample to sample. comparisons between all five unamplified populations from both genomes displayed similar and low count deviation between identical bins  and returned non-significant p-values  at all bin sizes , with similar non-significant p-values between the unamplified reference sample and the unamplified control . similarly, reads per bin from the control plotted against the reference displayed similar location and magnitude of over-represented reads , with the previously mentioned over-representation of repeat regions and the smaller minichromosomes . log-log plots of the reads per bin  reveal a strongly linear relationship that indicates that multiple sequencing runs do not induce significant bias in samples generated from the same original genomic library. having established the unamplified dna libraries as a baseline, potential bias in the whole genome amplified libraries was quantified.

bias ranking whole genome amplified template dna
regardless of bin size and genome, all whole genome amplified samples displayed significant bias relative to the unamplified reference . with one exception the relative amount of bias induced by the various methods remained consistent across both genomes and all bin size resolutions, with genomiphi generating the lowest d-statistics, followed by repli-g, pep and dop. the exception was found in the  <dig> base resolution analysis for c. jejuni, where genomiphi and repli-g exchanged position; while significant, the difference between the repli-g and genomiphi samples in this instance was slight . increased bin size elevated the magnitude of the d-statistics for all test and control populations, although the unamplified control d-statistics increased more rapidly with bin size than did the test populations , effectively decreasing the bias as bin size increased. this, however, is merely the result of smoothing a constant number of reads per population across a diminishing number of bins, and does not reflect any amplification-specific size related effect.

the deviation in counts per bin  and the d-statistics were 2- to 10-fold lower for c. jejuni than for halobacterium for all amplified populations, although the biases between the amplified c. jejuni populations were more extreme . this may reflect the fact that c. jejuni, a smaller circular genome, is better suited to the isothermal, highly processive mda approaches than the cyclically denatured, less-processive pcr-based methods. similar to the genome coverage results, the d-statistics indicated that the presence of mini-chromosomes and/or high gc content in halobacterium challenged all amplification techniques and reduced the advantage from the mda process.

multiple displacement amplification methods
the two multiple displacement amplification  methods, genomiphi and repli-g, introduced the lowest amplification bias, inducing the least distortion in counts per bin across the length of the genome and slight decreases in slope below the  <dig> degree line in the log-log plot . the maximum deviation from the reference distribution at  <dig> base resolution was  <dig> and  <dig> fold greater than the unamplified control for genomiphi on halobacterium and c. jejuni respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig> fold greater than halobacterium and c. jejuni control for repli-g . differences between the mda methods were slight, particularly in light of the aforementioned reversal in bias rank in the c. jejuni  <dig> base bin analysis. regardless of bin size, the d-statistic for repli-g was  <dig>  to  <dig>  times larger than that from genomiphi for halobacterium and  <dig>  to  <dig>  times greater for c. jejuni .

the bias estimates we derived for mda are comparable to those reported in the literature. the crude metric of counts per bin  yields estimates of  <dig>   to  <dig>  fold  overamplification relative to the average counts per bin for the unamplified replicates for halobacterium when genomiphi was used, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold for repli-g. raw count bias in c. jejuni was  <dig>  fold for both bin sizes for genomiphi and  <dig>   to  <dig>   for repli-g. the biases estimated for each genome by d-statistic are smaller but still comparable to the  <dig> - to 3-fold biases reported by dean et al.  <cit>  and hosono et al.  <cit>  as well as the  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold biases for multi-cell samples in raghunathan's study  <cit> . this is particularly interesting as the studies relied upon gene locus sequencing or qpcr quantitation, which focuses exclusively on coding regions of the genome, while our whole genome sequencing included both coding and non-coding regions, yet still reached similar estimates of bias.

pcr-based amplification methods
pcr-based amplification methods were more biased than mda methods for all bin sizes and both genomes, although the pep method was less biased than the dop amplified samples. visually, the counts per bin are obviously distorted around the repeat regions for pep amplified material , and even more drastically distorted for dop samples . log-log plots display a distinct non-linear relationship between reference and amplified samples, with the data cloud shifting to the right for both amplification methods, with more skew evident in dop than pep . at a  <dig> base resolution, d-statistics from pep amplified halobacterium and c. jejuni were  <dig> and  <dig> times greater than the reference value respectively, while d-statistics from dop amplified material were respectively  <dig> and  <dig> times larger than the halobacterium and c. jejuni reference. in comparisons between the pcr-based methods, the maximal deviation from the reference for the pep amplified halobacterium sample was  <dig>  to  <dig>  times lower than that amplified by dop; the d-statistic from the c. jejuni sample was  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold lower with pep relative to dop .

differing results between the pcr-based amplification methods can be partially attributed to the primer composition in each reaction. both mda and pep amplification used random bases , while dop employed a  <dig> base primer containing a random 6-mer flanked with specific 10-mer 5' and 6-mer 3' sequences. as amplification events were initiated from the annealed specific 3' region of the primer, this resulted in preferential amplification or over-amplification of genomic regions that permitted successful primer binding. similarly, regions where the primer hybridized poorly were amplified infrequently. additionally, pcr-driven competition for primers, polymerase, etc. may prevent any significant representation of the infrequently primed amplicons in the final amplified pool. these factors resulted in over-representation of genome regions containing the 3' primer sequence, and was clearly evident in the overamplification spike around base position  <dig>   in c. jejuni genome. in the course of sequencing the dop libraries, it was noted that sequences containing the dop 5' specific decamer  also contained the exact 3' hexamer  88% of the time, and matched  <dig> of the  <dig> bases at the 3' end 95% of the time. despite the low stringency of the dop thermocycling protocol, the dop primer annealed primarily to regions with at least  <dig> of  <dig> bases of homology to the 3' end of the dop primer. the tendency to amplify only those regions flanked by the dop primer sequence is a significant barrier to the applicability of dop protocol for amplification of entire genomes.

these findings are in agreement with much of the literature which finds that although dop-pcr amplified human dna is sufficient for general genotyping purposes  <cit> , sequence-specific overamplification and subsequent coverage bias results from amplification of smaller size, lower complexity genomes such as cosmids and plasmids  <cit> . lower complexity genomes would be expected to have lower, less uniform incidence of the 3' priming sequence than larger genomes, resulting in more bias from the amplified bacterial genomes used our research than the human dna examined by cheung et al. . simulated studies of dop-pcr uniformity found that for a given dop primer sequence, the specific regions of dop overamplification could be accurately predicted for several eukaryotic genomes  <cit> , although some  of the regions expected to amplify in the study failed to generate any product at all, illustrating the additional affect of bias stemming from amplicon amplification efficiency  <cit> . dean et al.  <cit>  reported a 6-fold bias in coding regions following pcr-based wga. the increased bias detected by whole genome sequencing in our study might reflect the fact that coding regions have evolved to permit polymerase access and expression, and therefore coding regions may experience less bias than non-coding regions.

although in our study pep amplification generated lower bias than dop, possibly due to increased degeneracy of the pep primers, both pep and dop suffered from potential biases inherent to pcr amplification. pcr-related bias in products amplified from complex mixtures is well documented in the literature, due to factors including differential gc content  <cit> , product reannealing  <cit>  and primer binding energy differences  <cit> . moreover, not all amplicons are amenable to pcr amplification  <cit> , resulting in missing sequence, the high-temperature denaturation required to render genomic dna single-stranded for pcr-based wga methods can cause cytosine deamination, and homoduplexes can form during the ramp from denaturation to annealing temperature  <cit> . all of these factors can result in the generation of up to 70% nonspecific amplification artefacts  <cit>  leading to incomplete coverage  <cit> . this agrees closely with the high percentage of pep and dop generated sequences  that failed to map to the reference genomes in our study. this final point is particularly relevant to researchers who are considering the use of wga amplified material for sequencing. given the high rate of non-specific or artifactual product formation in the pcr-based wga methods, the cost of sequencing is increased due to the poor return of sequence data per template. de novo sequencing is more drastically affected as the artifactual products might not be removed prior to contig assembly, and thus waste processing time and possibly generate incorrect scaffolds.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we utilized whole genome sequencing and sequence-based karyotyping to assess the bias induced by four methods of whole genome amplification. while the advantages and disadvantages of each wga method have been discussed extensively in literature  <cit> , previous comparisons between whole genome amplification techniques have used snp analysis, cgh or fish analyses to determine induced bias. snp analysis excels at detecting single base errors, but since snp analysis typically examines only a small fraction of a given genome, it has the potential to overlook or miss most amplification infidelities. additionally, as the loci examined by snp analysis are typically characterized by minimal sequence differentiation, these loci may be relatively immune to amplification bias as their amplification efficiencies would be roughly equivalent. bias detection via fish and cgh, on the other hand, is limited to a mapping resolution of approximately  <dig> megabases  <cit> , is incapable of detecting small scale errors or distortions and has difficulty detecting homozygous deletions  <cit> .

previously prohibitively expensive and time consuming, whole genome sequencing of entire genomes is now possible with the  <dig> sequencing system in a matter of days. using this approach we conducted a high resolution  examination of amplification-induced bias, detecting statistically significant  bias in all amplified dna samples relative to unamplified controls. mda-based amplification methods generated the highest amplification yield and most complete genome coverage while introducing the least bias of all the amplification methods examined. of the mda methods, repli-g generated  <dig> to 4-fold more amplified dna, but introduced marginally more bias than genomiphi, and generated significantly lower genome coverage when amplifying halobacterium species nrc- <dig>  it is important to note that both mda based processes were challenged by the high gc content, multi-copy minichromosome containing samples. this may result from the fact that more of the small circular chromosomes are probably present in the starting sample, are more likely than large chromosomes to survive extraction and purification processes intact, and strand displacement is more difficult in regions with increased gc content.

in summary, we have determined that none of the whole genome amplification methods we investigated are free from bias. depending upon the intended application, researchers should careful weigh the decision whether or not to use whole genome amplification. pcr-based wga methods generated roughly an order of magnitude less amplified dna than the mda methods, with concomitantly increased bias. in our analysis, the relatively low efficiency and yield and high bias generated by the pcr-based methodologies renders them unsuitable for whole genome sequencing and representative amplification of precious dna. this is not to say that the pcr-based methods are without merit, merely that based on our results, their use should be restricted to dna amplification for genotyping or marker identification purposes  <cit> , not uniform genomic amplification for high accuracy whole genome sequencing. mda-based techniques generated significantly higher yields of the proper  template, and induced lower, but still significant levels of bias. samples destined for high resolution copy number studies, or complex populations composed of genomes with diverse sizes and gc contents, such as environmental samples, may experience detectable and possibly unacceptable amplification bias. in contrast, applications such as strain identification or whole genome sequencing of purified samples may either tolerate the inherent bias, or surmount it through additional sequence oversampling. for applications amenable to amplified dna, our investigation determined that mda-based methodologies produce the greatest amplification yield with the lowest associated bias.
