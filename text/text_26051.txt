BACKGROUND
vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue constitute a major obstacle to socio-economic development in much of the tropics and remain high on the list of priorities for the improvement of public health. unlike other infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases stand out because of their complex mode of transmission, requiring the transition from man to man or animal to man through an arthropod vector. this method of transmission implies the simple principle that removal of the vector will lead to the elimination of the disease  <cit> . this principle has been verified historically, since whenever control of an insect-borne disease has been achieved, this has most often been done through the control of the vector rather than the direct control of the disease through drugs or vaccines. the only exception has been yellow fever, for which a functional vaccine was developed early on  <cit> . having this historical fact in mind, research has focused on controlling the vector, and this resulted in an increased output of medical entomological research over the last ten years or so. the best example of this is the acquisition of the complete genome sequence of anopheles gambiae  <cit> , the major malaria vector in sub-saharan africa and of aedes aegypti  <cit> , the major vector of yellow fever and dengue.

the wealth of results obtained has now led medical entomologists towards the development of novel ideas that take full account of this new knowledge. one such idea in which much research is invested is the "construction" of "new mosquitoes" that would be unable to transmit malaria or other diseases  <cit> . this "new mosquito" would be based on transgenic strains carrying genes that make them refractory to their parasites. after almost two decades in effort, the technology for creating transgenic mosquitoes has been developed and encouraging results have sprouted from this research  <cit> . however, there is still the need to identify those refractory genes best suited for "constructing" transgenic mosquitoes.

in the case of malaria, the insect's immunity genes have been considered as very good candidates, since following the sequencing of the an. gambiae genome  <cit>  a large set of genes that mediate mosquito susceptibility to plasmodium infections has been identified  <cit> . however, if the insect innate immune system is to be used as a potential blocking step in transmission of malaria, then it will require targeting one or a few genes of highest relevance and ease of manipulation. the problem, then, is to identify those of highest importance to malaria infection. by and large, the immune responses are adaptive for the mosquito. therefore, modification of such genes runs the risk of decreasing the mosquito's ability to stave off infections by microbes in general, thereby decreasing mosquito fitness and lessening the chance to become established in the natural population. ideally, one would want to identify a gene, or part of a gene, that specifically targets the particular pathogen of interest. furthermore, it is crucial that the gene used in any attempt to block transmission in natural populations focus on genes specific to the relevant mosquito and plasmodium species, since it has been suggested that the defense exhibited by the vector species, varies depending on the invading plasmodium species  <cit> .

in this study we focus on the species of the an. gambiae complex and we assess the genetic polymorphism of four genes  that have been identified as part of the innate immune system of an.gambiae. the an. gambiae complex is composed of seven closely related species, i.e. an. gambiae, anopheles arabiensis, anopheles melas, anopheles merus, anopheles bwambae and anopheles quadriannulatus a and b. the first two species are the major vectors of human malaria in sub-saharan africa, with an. melas and an. merus being intermediate in importance. the last three species are highly zoophilic and are never or rarely exposed to the human plasmodium falciparum.

the studied loci have been implicated in the resistance towards plasmodium infections largely through microarray and rnai experiments  <cit> . molecular population genetics and phylogenetics is an independent approach that could verify that evolutionary patterns re-enforce implications from laboratory studies. within a comparative framework, we evaluate the possibility that these four genes evolve, in the lineages of the major malaria vectors, under selection imposed by the direct or indirect interaction with the plasmodium. the approach relies on the prediction that if plasmodium infection affects the mosquito's fitness, we may expect the accumulation of adaptive amino acid substitutions in those anti-malarial genes that are crucial in specifically limiting plasmodium infection in vector species, whereas such changes are less likely to be found in closely related species that have historically limited interaction with the parasite. an assumption of this approach is that the anopheles species have exhibited an adaptive response to p.falciparum infection which is suggested by several lines of evidence  <cit> .

RESULTS
polymorphism, divergence and mcdonald-kreitman tests
gambicin
a fragment of  <dig> to  <dig> bp  was amplified from all specimens. this fragment includes all the coding sequence of the gene, consisting of  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig> sequences  including the whole coding region of this gene were obtained from six species of the an. gambiae complex. out of the  <dig> sequences  <dig> represented different alleles. the nucleotide diversity  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the synonymous and non-synonymous sites, respectively . there were very few mutations  shared between species, whereas there were four alleles out of the  <dig>  that were shared between them. for the coding region, dxy  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . very few fixed differences were present between species, and in most comparisons no fixed non-synonymous differences were found . not surprisingly therefore, the mcdonald-kreitman tests did not indicate positive selection.

species names are abbreviated as follows: an. arabiensis: ara, an. bwambae: bwa, an. gambiae: gam, an. melas: mel, an. merus: mer, an. quadriannulatus: qua. s: synonymous mutations, ns: non-synonymous mutations, n.s.: non significant.

nos
a total of  <dig> sequences were produced from the studied species . the sequences produced varied from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, of which  <dig> bp were coding. out of the  <dig> sequences  <dig> were different alleles. although there were some shared polymorphisms  between the species, there were no alleles shared between them. dxy ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the coding region. nucleotide diversity  ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the synonymous and non-synonymous sites, respectively. a single fixed replacement substitution was observed in all pairwise comparisons  with an. arabiensis . however, none of the mcdonald-kreitman tests were significant.

rel2
we obtained  <dig> sequences from six species. the fragments amplified in all specimens ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. of these approximately  <dig> bp were coding sequence . out of the  <dig> sequences  <dig> were different alleles . there were a few polymorphisms shared between species  but there were no shared alleles. dxy ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between species. the nucleotide diversity  in the synonymous as well as in the non-synonymous sites was quite low varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the synonymous sites, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the non-synonymous sites. as was the case in the previous genes, the mcdonald-kreitman tests of positive selection did not show a significant excess of fixed non-synonymous differences between the species, although there were fixed replacement substitutions present in all the pairwise species comparisons .

species names are abbreviated as in table  <dig>  s: synonymous mutations, ns: non-synonymous mutations, n.s.: non significant.

fbn9
we successfully determined  <dig> sequences from the six species all together. the fragments amplified in all specimens ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and they were all coding sequence . of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> were different alleles . there were a lot of mutations  shared between species, but again there were no alleles shared. dxy ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between species. nucleotide diversity  in the synonymous sites was higher compared to the previous genes and varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . however, it was quite low in the non-synonymous sites since it ranged from  <dig>  up to  <dig> . as presented in table  <dig> there is not even a single fixed non-synonymous substitution between the species of the complex. consequently, the mcdonald-kreitman tests were negative regarding positive selection acting on the gene .

a second series of mcdonald-kreitman tests were performed for all the genes, but this time the alleles were not grouped according to species. they were grouped according to their phylogenetic relationships, as indicated by the inferred phylogenetic trees. for example in rel <dig>  a set of the an. gambiae alleles were pooled together with the an. bwambae sequences to form a single group, as indicated by the phylogenetic tree of figure  <dig>  this group of alleles was subsequently contrasted to the alleles of the remaining species. again no signs of positive selection could be detected.

phylogeny and maximum likelihood tests for selection
since no non-synonymous fixed differences were found in any species pairwise comparisons for gambicin and fbn <dig>  only nos and rel <dig> were subjected to the paml analysis. the phylogenetic trees for these two genes, produced from the bayesian analysis, and on which the various models of the paml software were evaluated for their goodness of fit, are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

in the nos tree  only an. merus, an. melas and an. quadriannulatus form strongly supported monophyletic groups. some alleles of an.bwambae  are placed very far apart from their conspecific sequences. furthermore, each one of these two sets of an. bwambae alleles, seems to be closely related to a different anopheles species. the alleles bwa <dig> b/bwa <dig> b are placed within the clade hosting an. merus, an. bwambae and an. quadriannulatus, whereas the alleles bwa <dig> a/bwa <dig> b seem to be more closely related to an. gambiae and an. arabiensis. at the same time, the alleles of an. gambiae seem to be forming two separate clades that are firmly to each other and are ambiguously related to the an. arabiensis clade.

in the rel <dig> tree , the alleles of most species form strongly supported monophyletic groups and the relationships between the species are well resolved . as was the case in nos, the alleles of an. gambiae form two separate clades that are placed apart. in the case of rel <dig>  one of the an. gambiae groups is closely related to an. bwambae, and the other is part of a broader clade that incorporates both the an. merus and the an. melas clades.

in the case of the nos gene, only the likelihood ratio test of m <dig> versus m <dig>  was statistically significant and in favor of variable selection pressure among sites. all other likelihood ratio tests comparing the among sites models, were not in favor of an ω value greater than one among sites . similar results were obtained for rel <dig>  where again only the comparison between models m <dig> and m <dig>  indicated variable selection pressure acting on the amplified rel <dig> fragment.

regarding the branch-site tests for the nos and rel <dig> , regardless of whether an. gambiae or an. arabiensis were designated as the foreground branches, the likelihood ratio tests were not in favor of positive selection acting on at least some codons of the foreground branches in either gene. the branch-site test  <dig> for nos, was also applied to a phylogenetically designated "gambiae" clade. by this we mean that we considered as the gambiae clade  not only the alleles of an. gambiae, but those of an. arabiensis and an. bwambae that are ambiguously related to the an. gambiae alleles, as well . the result of the branch-site test  <dig> was negative in this case as well.

discussion
the nucleotide diversity  of all studied loci was quite low in all the species of the an. gambiae complex both in the synonymous and the non-synonymous substitutions . gambicin exhibited the lowest levels of variation and fbn <dig> the least . the levels of divergence of these loci between the different species were low as well. among the four analyzed loci, rel <dig> and fbn <dig> were the most divergent, with dxy values range from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and  <dig>  to  <dig> %, respectively.

in the gambicin locus it can be seen that in some species pairwise comparisons the fixed differences  are zero . one could argue that this could be the result of introgression between the species and/or the continued segregation of inherited ancestral polymorphisms. however, we argue that these two processes have not equally affected the observed pattern. introgression cannot be ruled out between the lineages of an. gambiae and an. arabiensis, since in the phylogenetic tree of the respective gene , the alleles of an. arabiensis cluster together with the an. gambiae alleles. evidence for introgression between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis has been reported previously  <cit> . at the same time, the role of the shared ancestral polymorphisms in the observed pattern is limited since in gambicin the shared polymorphisms between the species were in the majority of the pairwise comparisons zero . we estimated  the level of divergence between species using the non-coding regions of the gambicin gene. the net between species average kimura two-parameter distance  <cit>  as estimated by mega v. <dig>   <cit> , ranged between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . this level of divergence is quite low compared to the respective level of divergence for rel <dig> and nos . the complete absence of fixed non-synonymous substitutions between pairwise species comparisons in the gambicin locus indicates that purifying selection is the major force that shapes the observed evolutionary pattern of gambicin . gambicin has been found to be an important antibacterial peptide, that is however, marginally lethal to p. berghei  <cit>  and has no specificity towards p. falciparum  <cit> . more likely, this gene as many others belonging to the antimicrobial defense system of the mosquito, evolve under the selection constrains imposed by the bacteria that the mosquitoes encounter during their lifetime. as dong et al.  also conclude there is little reason to believe that gambicin has undergone major adaptations to malaria.

in the nos locus, a great number of polymorphic sites were recorded in all species pairwise comparisons . however, the fixed non-synonymous difference was one in each species comparison of an. arabiensis with the other species . as was the case with the gambicin locus, in the phylogenetic tree of nos, signs of introgression between an. gambiae and an. arabiensis are evident . moreover, two alleles originating from an. bwambae, were placed within the an. gambiae/an. arabiensis clade, another two alleles were placed very close to an. melas and the majority of the alleles formed a separate and relatively well supported monophyletic clade. the case for genetic introgression between an. bwambae and an. gambiae has been made previously  <cit> , and this is reflected here as well. however, we consider that in the case of nos, we are also witnessing sharing of ancestral polymorphisms between the species pairs an. bwambae/an. merus and an. bwambae/an. quadriannulatus. we claim this since out of ten shared polymorphisms, four were shared between the previously mentioned pairs of species.

the expression pattern of nos was found to vary depending on the plasmodium species infecting an. gambiae  <cit> , implying that the differential expression pattern is the effect of co-evolution between the host and its specific parasite. the present study does not add support to this interpretation since both the mcdonald-kreitman tests and the paml analysis did not detect any signs of positive selection acting on the nos gene. even though the paml analysis indicated that varying selective pressure is acting on the codons of the nos fragment amplified , all other likelihood models that allowed for positive selection to be acting on some codons or branches of the nos fragment, produced negative results .

in the phylogenetic tree of rel <dig>  there is a group of an. gambiae alleles that are very closely related to alleles of an. bwambae. shared polymorphisms in the rel <dig> locus are detected between an. arabiensis and an. gambiae but not between an. gambiae and an. bwambae. consequently, the unexpected clustering of the an. gambiae alleles with an. bwambae, is more likely due to introgression between the two species, as noted above for other genes.

at the rel <dig> locus the level of nucleotide differences among species  were comparable to those observed in the nos locus. however, at the rel <dig> locus, there are several fixed non-synonymous differences between certain pair of species. for example, between an. arabiensis and an. melas there were eight non-synonymous fixed differences. neither the mcdonald-kreitman nor the maximum likelihood tests for selection provide evidence of positive selection in this gene. rel <dig>  like gambicin and nos was found to be under purifying selection. as was the case in nos, the maximum likelihood analysis of paml, pointed to a varying selective pressure among sites , but no signs of positive selection were detected in the site by site or the branch-site analysis .

rel <dig> regulates the expression of the antibacterial genes cec <dig>  gam <dig>  def <dig>  cec <dig>  and key malaria parasite antagonists, lrim <dig>  tep <dig>  and tep <dig> in an. gambiae  <cit> . thus, rel <dig> is regulating the expression pattern of many and diverse genes of the anopheles innate immune system, among which at least two  have very strong anti-malaria activity. however, the remaining genes regulated by rel <dig> are, as far as known, antibacterial peptides. therefore, even though rel <dig> may be involved in the defense against malaria infection, its involvement in the expression pattern of many antimicrobial genes may greatly reduce the possibility of this gene specifically exhibiting an evolutionary response to plasmodium. however the comparative approach applied here did detect purifying selection acting on the amplified rel <dig> fragment from the six species of the an. gambiae, as would be expected in a locus coding for a product that serves as the regulator of the expression of the general antimicrobial defense of the organism. because rel <dig> is mostly involved in antibacterial defense, why are we not witnessing positive selection imposed by the bacterial pathogens? this type of positive selection has been reported for gnbp <dig>  gnbp <dig> and relish in termites and was related to the diverse microbes encountered in different habitats  <cit> . in the present study, there are significant ecological differences among the studied species. for example the species an. melas and an. merus favour brackish water for immature development, in contrast to the freshwater species an. gambiae and an. arabiensis. even though ecological differences among the studied species are evident, no positive selection could be detected. at this point we have to point that the rel <dig> fragment targeted in our study resides in the n-terminal homology domain region of rel <dig>  whereas positive selection has been detected  <cit>  in the spacer connecting this region to the c-terminal ankyrin repeat region .

the fbn <dig> locus is characterized by a very large number of polymorphic site differences  between the species . in the phylogenetic tree of fbn <dig>  the alleles of an. gambiae are interspersed across the tree, whereas the alleles of the remaining species form strongly supported monophyletic groups ambiguously connected to each other. once more the observed pattern could be the result of introgression between species, or the sharing of ancestral polymorphisms. because the shared polymorphisms are present in almost all species pairwise comparisons in the case of fbn <dig>  we argue that the effect of shared ancestral polymorphisms has played a key role in this pattern. in some cases the shared polymorphisms are as many as eight  or  <dig> .

characterization of the fbn gene family has suggested that the fbns have structural features  that allow them to recognize parasites and play an essential role in the mosquito's innate immunity, in addition to the physiological processes associated with blood feeding  <cit> . fbn <dig> a member of the fbn family, was recently found to be up-regulated when an. gambiae was invaded by p. falciparum ookinetes but not responding to p. berghei ookinetes invasion  <cit> . the structural features of fbn <dig>  as well as the fact that in rnai gene silencing assays, a fbn <dig> knockdown increases an. gambiae mosquitoes susceptibility to both p. falciparum and p. berghei infections  <cit> , raise the possibility that this gene could be evolving in response to plasmodium. furthermore, in a recent study  <cit>  it was shown that positive selection drives the evolution of pattern recognition receptors in drosophila. however, even in the case of fbn <dig> no signs of positive selection could be detected and there were not even any fixed non-synonymous differences between the species . fbn <dig> is also involved in the immune response against bacteria  <cit>  and this could be the major reason why this gene as well has not undergone major adaptations to malaria.

presently there are only three studies assessing genetic variation in innate immunity genes specifically implicated as being important in controlling plasmodium infection in anopheles  <cit> . in a study of the defensin gene  <cit>  an. gambiae, an. arabiensis and an. quadriannulatus were involved and the authors concluded that strong purifying selection is acting on the mature peptide and probably the whole coding region. furthermore, the authors argued that since an. quadriannulatus is not exposed to human pathogens, identical mature peptide and similar pattern of polymorphism across the three species implies that human pathogens played no role as selective agents on this peptide. similarly, it was concluded  <cit>  that no evidence for strong selection could be detected on a suite of mosquito immune system genes, ctl <dig>  ctlma <dig>  lrim <dig>  and apl <dig> , which have been shown to affect plasmodium development in functional studies. the authors used five different species of the an. gambiae complex, namely an. gambiae, an. arabiensis, an. bwambae and an. merus. however, they only focused on an. gambiae and used all remaining species as outgroups in their analyses. one of the loci studied in  <cit> , lrim <dig>  has been the subject of a separate study  <cit>  in which besides the conservative mcdonald-kreitman tests for positive selection, a maximum likelihood approach with paml software was also applied. in the latter study, six species of the an. gambiae complex were involved and it was concluded that lrim <dig> underwent adaptive evolution in the an. arabiensis lineage.

lrim <dig> was recently established as a major anti-plasmodium factor  <cit>  and it has been speculated that it could be possible that only some lrim <dig> alleles suppress infection with p. falciparum, and these may even be specific for certain p.falciparum strains  <cit> . lrim <dig> is the only gene of the anopheles immune system that directly interacts with plasmodium and has not been implicated to be involved in the defense against other pathogens. lrim <dig> is also the only anopheles immune gene that has been studied that shows strong signs of positive selection acting in one of the major malaria vectors, an. arabiensis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it is not surprising that studies of the genes considered here as well as those by  <cit>  and  <cit>  could not detect selection related specifically to plasmodium. however, the positive results of  <cit>  lend credence to the general comparative approach in identifying the minority of the hundreds of genes implicated in the insect innate immunity response that may have responded specifically to plasmodium. considering the results presented here in concert with previous studies, genes that interact directly with the plasmodium parasite, and play little or no role in defense against other microbes, are probably the most likely candidates for a specific adaptive response against p. falciparum. however, even though several lines of evidence exist and support that that the anopheles species have exhibited an adaptive response to p. falciparum infection  <cit> , we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the mosquitoes are utilizing solely their anti-bacterial defense system to fight against plasmodium. furthermore, since it is hard to establish direct evidence linking the adaptation of any candidate gene to p. falciparum infection, a comparative framework allowing at least an indirect link should be provided. such a framework could be achieved, if a similar approach like the one involved here, was applied to all other anopheline complexes that transmit p. falciparum malaria. such complexes do exist  in continental sub-saharan africa. considering the systematic status of these anopheline complexes  <cit> , it can be safely argued that the acquisition of p. falciparum by each of these complex of species was an independent evolutionary event. in the case that the same candidate gene and/or the same fragment of the respective gene, was identified as being evolving under positive selection in more than one of these complexes, then an indirect yet very strong proof of evolution imposed by p. falciparum infection, would be recognized.
