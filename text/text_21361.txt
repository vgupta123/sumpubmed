BACKGROUND
the vertebrate lysozyme gene family has traditionally been considered to be composed of three genes: lysozyme c, lactalbumin, and calcium-binding lysozyme  <cit> . lysozyme c, chicken-type  lysozyme, is a bacteriolytic enzyme that is secreted into many body fluids of mammals  and is found at a high concentration in the eggs of many bird species  <cit> . lysozyme c is widespread in nature; its protein and gene sequences have been characterized from numerous diverse vertebrate and non-vertebrate species  <cit> . lactalbumin is related to lysozyme, with around 40% amino acid identity and nearly identical three-dimensional structure, but lacks its bacteriolytic activity  <cit> . lactalbumin is expressed in lactating mammary glands, where it binds a calcium ion and modifies the activity of Î²-galactosyltransferase- <dig>  such that the complex catalyzes the synthesis of lactose  <cit> . lactalbumin has recently been shown to have a second activity in the gut, where it loses the calcium ion and binds a fatty acid; this new form of lactalbumin appears to promote apoptosis of tumor cells, and thus has been renamed hamlet   <cit> . lactalbumin appears to be found only in mammals, and is widely distributed in this group. calcium-binding lysozyme has bacteriolytic activity like lysozyme c, but also shares with lactalbumin the ability to bind a calcium ion. calcium-binding lysozymes appear to be relatively rare; they have been found in the milk of only a few mammalian species , as well as in the eggs  and stomachs  of some bird species  <cit> . indeed, calcium-binding lysozyme genes have not been reported for the human or rodent genomes.

previous phylogenetic analyses of lysozyme c, lactalbumin, and calcium-binding lysozyme sequences had suggested that the earliest divergences within this gene family occurred between lysozyme c and the ancestor of the genes for lactalbumin and calcium-binding lysozyme, and that this initial gene duplication may have preceded the divergence of the lineages leading to fish and mammals  <cit> . the separation of the lactalbumin and calcium-binding lysozyme genes was proposed to be more recent, with some studies  <cit>  suggesting a divergence on the early mammalian lineage, which would be consistent with the restriction of the lactalbumin gene to mammals. in contrast, another study  <cit>  suggested that the duplication generating the lactalbumin and calcium-binding lysozyme genes predated the bird-mammal divergence. moreover, the orthology of the mammalian and avian calcium-binding lysozymes has even been questioned  <cit> . thus, the origin of these mammalian lysozyme-like genes remains an open question.

recently, cdnas for several additional lysozyme-like sequences have been identified from human testis cdna libraries  <cit> . these cdnas were found to be encoded by genes that are now annotated by ensembl  <cit>  as lyzl : lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig> and lyzl <dig> . the predicted protein sequences of some of these lysozyme-like sequences have amino acid substitutions at sites important for the catalytic activity of lysozyme, suggesting that these proteins would not be able to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds of bacterial peptidoglycan  <cit> . since these four new lysozyme-like genes  are expressed predominantly in the testes, it has been suggested that they might have a role in reproduction  <cit> . such a role has been shown for lyzl <dig> and spaca <dig> in mice  <cit> .

the identification of these lyzl genes in the human genome suggests that the mammalian lysozyme-like gene family is larger than previously appreciated, and raises the possibility that the lysozyme-like proteins encoded by these genes may have novel biological functions. here we have used extensive similarity searches of the human and other vertebrate genomes. we thereby identified three additional intact lysozyme-like genes in the human genome; these have been annotated in the databases, but not reported in the literature. we have also identified multiple lysozyme-like genes in the genomes of diverse vertebrates. using a combination of phylogenetic and genomic neighborhood  analyses, wherein the relationships of the genes that flank the lysozyme-like genes in diverse species were examined, we demonstrate that orthologs of the human lysozyme-like genes are found in the genomes of diverse mammalian species. our analyses suggest that there were at least six, and perhaps as many as nine, diverse types  of lysozyme-like genes in the genome of the common ancestor of all extant mammals, and that these diverse genes have been maintained on most mammalian lineages. this suggests that their protein products probably have essential biological functions that are yet to be identified.

RESULTS
number of lysozyme genes in the human genome
to determine the size of the lysozyme-like gene family, we performed blast  <cit>  similarity searches of the human genome for sequences that predict potential protein sequences similar to lysozyme c, and thereby identified a total of nine annotated genes . of these nine annotated genes, six had previously been characterized: lysozyme c   <cit> , lactalbumin   <cit> , lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  <cit> , and spaca <dig>   <cit> . the three remaining genes identified in our blast searches -- the lyzl <dig>  spaca <dig> , and spaca5b genes -- had been annotated as lysozyme-like in ensembl  <cit> , but have not been discussed in the literature. a tenth lysozyme-like sequence was later identified using our genomic neighborhood analysis , but appears to be a pseudogene . these ten lysozyme-like sequences are distributed over five chromosomes in humans, with two genes each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and x, three genes on chromosome  <dig>  and one gene on chromosome  <dig> . each of the potentially functional genes predicts a protein sequence about 140- <dig> amino acids long, similar to lysozyme c and lactalbumin. the mature regions of these proteins are readily aligned due to the presence of many highly conserved residues, including the eight cysteines known to be involved in disulfide bonds in lysozyme and lactalbumin . each of the lysozyme-like genes has been annotated as being composed of four or five exons. the 140- <dig> amino acid coding regions are spread over four exons in each of the genes with the introns in exactly the same locations, including phases, as found in the lysozyme c and lactalbumin genes  <cit>  . moreover, the lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  and spaca <dig> genes are annotated as having an additional 5' exon, which in some cases might be translated to produce proteins that have longer n-terminal regions .

most of the predicted human proteins  show between 30% and 53% amino acid sequence identity in pairwise comparisons , suggesting that the gene duplications that gave rise to them are fairly ancient . if these gene duplications were indeed ancient, then we would expect to find these genes in diverse mammalian species . in contrast, the lyzl1/lyzl <dig> and spaca5/spaca5b protein pairs are 97% and 100% identical, respectively ; this suggests that their genes likely duplicated fairly recently, and thus these duplicates are predicted to be more limited phylogenetically. the lyzl <dig> and lyzl <dig> genes are both located on human chromosome  <dig>  but are separated by about  <dig> mb; moreover, these genes are embedded within  <dig> kb long repeated sequences that are greater than 95% identical . this suggests that the lyzl <dig> and lyzl <dig> gene duplicates were generated as part of a recent segmental duplication on chromosome  <dig>  likewise, the spaca <dig> and spaca5b genes are both on the x chromosome, separated by about  <dig> kb, and are within long  repeated dna sequences that have high sequence identity . thus, the lyzl1/lyzl <dig> and spaca5/spaca5b gene pairs both appear to have originated from relatively recent and large genomic segmental duplications, a common form of gene duplication in mammals  <cit> . the high sequence identity of these gene pairs also could be due, at least in part, to concerted evolution  <cit> , as discussed below.

lysozyme genes in other vertebrate genomes
to determine whether an expanded lysozyme-like gene family is a general feature of mammalian  genomes, we conducted intensive homology searches for lysozyme-like genes in all vertebrate genomes available in the ensembl and pre!ensembl databases   <cit> . these results are listed in supplementary table  <dig> , and summarized for mammals in figure  <dig>  at least one lysozyme-like gene was found in each vertebrate genome, with the exception of the lamprey. multiple lysozyme-like genes were identified in all of the mammalian species ranging from  <dig> in opossum to  <dig> in cow. the fewest number of genes were found in bony fish, where only one gene was identified per genome, and in birds, where at most two genes were identified per genome. the anole lizard and xenopus tropicalis, the lone representatives of reptiles and amphibians with sequenced genomes, had  <dig> and  <dig> lysozyme-like genes, respectively.

importantly, the blast searches identified potential orthologs in most mammalian genomes  of all of the divergent lysozyme-like genes found in the human genome . initial assignments of orthology of these mammalian genes were based upon sequence similarity, but were subsequently confirmed by performing genomic neighborhood and phylogenetic analyses . our combined findings about gene number and orthologous relationships of the mammalian lysozyme-like gene family members are outlined in figure  <dig>  in contrast to the mammalian genes, the lysozyme-like genes found in the other vertebrate genomes could not be readily classified into the above subfamilies based upon sequence similarities; this is because these genes and their encoded proteins displayed similar levels of sequence identity to all of the different mammalian paralogs. furthermore, no evidence of synteny with the mammalian genes was found for any of the non-mammalian vertebrate genes, except for the lysozyme c gene. thus, none of the non-mammalian vertebrate lysozyme-like genes could be definitively classified as orthologs of any of the lysozyme-like mammalian genes, other than lyz itself.

many of the genes that were identified in our searches were only partial sequences, most likely due to the incomplete nature of the genomes in question. however, all but one of these genes were consistent with a structure similar to that of the mammalian lysozyme and lactalbumin genes -- that is, their coding regions appeared to be composed of four exons having similar intron-exon structures  <cit> . the lone exception was a lyzl1/2-like gene found in the treeshrew , which had a nearly full-length coding sequence that contained stop codons and frameshifts, but no introns; thus, this gene appears to be a processed pseudogene. taken together, these observations suggest that essentially all of the vertebrate lysozyme-like genes have been generated by duplications of genomic dna, rather than by reverse-transcription and insertion into genome.

phylogeny of vertebrate lysozymes
the presence of multiple lysozyme-like genes in all mammalian genomes, as well as in the genomes of several other vertebrate species, raises the possibility that the lysozyme-like gene family may have amplified early in vertebrate evolution. to examine this issue, and to further establish the orthology-paralogy relationships of lysozyme-like genes, we conducted a series of phylogenetic analyses .

importantly, as illustrated by the bayesian analysis shown in figure  <dig>  all of these phylogenetic analyses suggested that most lineages of mammals have eight different types of lysozyme-like genes : lyz, lalba, lysc <dig>  lyzl1/ <dig>  lyzl <dig>  lyzl <dig>  spaca <dig>  and spaca <dig>  regardless of type of phylogenetic analysis, these mammalian genes always clustered together as monophyletic groups, or clades, supporting their orthologous relationships. these mammalian gene clades routinely had high statistical support, again regardless of method used. these results are consistent with the orthologous relationships suggested by the original blast searches, as well as with our genomic neighborhood analyses . however, the genes from the other vertebrates did not consistently group with any of these mammalian orthologs, with the exception of some of the lysozyme c sequences.

in addition, it is clear that most, if not all, of the eight mammalian lysozyme-like genes duplicated and diverged from each other prior to the divergence of the earliest mammalian lineages. this is clear for at least two reasons. first, both the platypus and the eutherian genomes contain copies of most of these gene duplicates; therefore, these genes must have diverged earlier than did the species lineages. second, some of the non-mammalian vertebrate genes appear to have phylogenetic affinity for some of the mammalian gene lineages, although few have much statistical support. this is particularly evident for many of the lizard genes which, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  tend to branch with various mammalian orthologs. if this result is not an artifact, then many of the lysozyme-like genes must have duplicated prior to the mammal-reptile  divergence. if this were the case, however, then these gene duplicates must have been deleted from the genomes of birds.

whereas our phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of each of the mammalian lysozyme-like gene duplicates, the relationships between the paralogs were not resolved well . while many of our phylogenetic analyses, including the one shown in figure  <dig> , suggested that the lalba clade was the earliest diverging lineage and that most of the lyzl and spaca genes  were most closely related to each other, these relationships were not consistently found . therefore, the phylogenetic analyses are inconclusive concerning the relationships of the different subfamilies of mammalian lysozyme-like genes.

the phylogenetic trees also suggested the possibility that at least some of the gene divergences occurred very early in vertebrate evolution, i.e., prior to the mammal-fish divergence. for example, the mammalian lyz gene sequences were found to branch with lyz genes from fish, rather than with the other mammalian lysozyme-like genes ; if this branching order reflects the actual evolutionary history of the genes , then the lyz gene lineage must have diverged from the other lysozyme-like genes prior to the mammal-fish divergence. again, if this were true, then many species lineages must have deleted the duplicates from their genomes. below, we discuss each subfamily of lysozyme-like gene in the mammals, and consider their potential non-mammalian orthologs.

lysozyme c  genes
the lyz gene is the best-studied lysozyme-like gene, and has been extensively characterized in many species  <cit> . our genome searches and phylogenetic analyses identified many genes that appear to be orthologous to lyz in diverse vertebrates . to confirm the orthology of the lyz genes, we used a genomic neighborhood analysis, wherein we examined the orthology of the genes that flank the lyz gene in diverse species. the avian and mammalian lyz genes are flanked by the cpsf <dig> and yeats <dig> genes . this organization is maintained in species with tandemly duplicated lyz genes, such as rodents and cow, where the cpsf <dig> and yeats <dig> genes are found flanking a cluster of lyz genes . a slightly different organization is seen in the opossum, which has four lyz genes; in this case the cpsf <dig> gene is upstream of two of the lyz genes and the yeats <dig> gene is downstream of the other two, but these two clusters are separated by about  <dig> mb of dna that potentially was inserted into the opossum genome . of the numerous lysozyme genes found in xenopus tropicalis, the lyza gene was found to be most closely related to the avian and mammalian lyz genes in the phylogenetic trees ; consistent with this, the lyza gene is located adjacent to a yeats <dig> ortholog , suggesting it is a true ortholog of the mammalian lyz gene. most fish lyz sequences branch in a clade with mammalian lyz genes . however, although the cpsf <dig> and yeats <dig> genes are neighbors in the fish genomes, the fish lysozyme genes are not adjacent to either of these genes; thus the genomic neighborhood analysis does not provide support for the orthology of fish and mammalian lyz genes. intriguingly, the zebrafish lyz gene was found to be in a different genomic context from other fish lyz genes , which would agree with the hypothesis generated by the phylogenetic analyses  that the zebrafish lyz gene is not truly orthologous to the other fish lyz genes.

the number of lyz genes found in mammalian genomes varied from  <dig>  in most species, to  <dig> . multiple lyz genes had previously been identified in the genomes of mice and rats  <cit> , rabbits  <cit> , and artiodactyls  <cit> . in addition to these species, multiple lyz genes were found in many other species, including guinea pig , elephant , armadillo , sloth , opossum , and wallaby  . phylogenetic analysis of the lyz sequences, suggested that the multiple genes in diverse species are due to independent gene duplications or amplification events . however, previous work has shown that lyz genes have been subjected to concerted evolution on the ruminant and rodent lineages  <cit> . since the inference of independent gene duplication on sister lineages, instead of on their common ancestral lineage, is a pattern generated by concerted evolution, the distributions of duplicated lyz genes  combined with the phylogenetic analysis  suggests that concerted evolution might also have occurred on lineages such as afrotheria  and marsupials .

lysozyme-like 1/ <dig>  genes
as mentioned above, the lyzl <dig> and lyzl <dig> genes in the human genome appear to have been generated recently via a genomic segmental duplication. indeed, with the exception of those primate species that are close relatives of human, most other mammals have only a single gene sequence similar to lyzl <dig> or lyzl <dig> . comparison of the genomic neighborhoods surrounding the lyzl1/ <dig> genes in diverse mammals demonstrates orthology of these genes, as the genes adjacent to them are either bambi or dnm1p <dig>  or both . interestingly, although an ortholog of lyzl1/ <dig> was found in the platypus genome, one could not be found in the opossum, even though the bambi and dnm1p <dig> genes are adjacent in this species; this suggests that the lyzl1/ <dig> gene was deleted from the opossum genome . both human and macaque have duplicated lyzl1/ <dig> genes that reside in similar genomic neighborhoods , which should imply that the lyzl1/ <dig> gene duplication occurred prior to the human-macaque divergence. phylogenetic analysis of the lyzl1/ <dig> sequences, however, implies that independent gene duplication events occurred on the macaque, human, and marmoset lineages . a more likely scenario than multiple independent gene duplications in these closely-related primate species is that the original lyzl1/ <dig> gene duplication event occurred in their common ancestor , and concerted evolution between the lyzl <dig> and lyzl <dig> genes has obscured this original event. although a lyzl1/ <dig> pseudogene was found in the treeshrew , it was generated independently, as discussed above. potential lyzl1/ <dig> orthologs in zebrafish and lizard were suggested by phylogenetic analysis ; however, these genes were not in genomic neighborhoods similar to those of the mammalian genes , so their evolutionary relationships remain ambiguous.

lysozyme-like  <dig>  genes
the lyzl <dig> gene was either found as a single copy, or was missing, in all of the mammalian genomes examined . many of the missing genes likely reflect incomplete genomes rather than deletions. genomic neighborhood analysis confirmed the orthology of the lyzl <dig> genes across placental mammals. however, the flanking genes are on different chromosomes in opossum, suggesting that chromosomal recombination had occurred . phylogenetic analyses of lyzl <dig> sequences were consistent with it being a single copy gene . the only potential non-mammalian orthologs of lyzl <dig> identified by the phylogenetic analyses were from the lizard ; however, the lizard and mammalian genes were not in similar genomic neighborhoods .

lysozyme-like  <dig>  genes
most mammals exhibited only one lyzl <dig> gene, although the opossum had none. yet, in contrast to most of the other paralogs, great variation in the number of lyzl <dig> genes was observed across mammals, with five genes identified in the dog and four genes identified in both the alpaca and the hyrax . given the distant relationships of these three species, these gene duplication events must have occurred independently. the placental and wallaby lyzl <dig> genes reside in a conserved genomic neighborhood, which again suggests that this gene was deleted on the opossum lineage . the presence of multiple lyzl <dig> genes in a genome raises the possibility of concerted evolution; however, sufficient data were not available to allow examination of this possibility for the lyzl <dig> genes . the phylogenetic analyses did not suggest any candidates for lyzl <dig> orthologs in non-mammalian species .

sperm acrosomal protein  <dig>  genes
spaca <dig>  like lyzl <dig>  was not found to be duplicated in any of the mammalian genomes examined . spaca <dig> resides in a conserved genomic neighborhood in placental mammals; however, a spaca <dig> gene is absent from this genomic neighborhood in the opossum . while the wallaby and platypus spaca <dig> genes could not be placed in a genomic context due to the short lengths of their genomic contigs , phylogenetic analysis of these sequences .

sperm acrosomal protein  <dig>  genes
the spaca <dig> gene was found only within placental mammals, with no orthologs suggested by phylogenetic analysis or similarity searches in marsupials, platypus, or other vertebrates . thus, it is possible that this gene duplication happened in the ancestor of placental mammals. genomic neighborhood analysis showed that the spaca <dig> gene was in a similar neighborhood on the human, macaque, mouse, and dog x chromosomes ; this genomic region was not found in marsupials, platypus, or other vertebrates . the spaca <dig> gene was found to be uniquely duplicated in the human genome . a very recent duplication of spaca <dig>  since human-chimpanzee divergence, could account for the perfect identity of the protein sequences  without requiring concerted evolution; however, concerted evolution between the human spaca <dig> and spaca5b genes cannot be excluded.

lysozyme-like  <dig>  gene
the platypus genome contained one lysozyme-like gene, named lyzl <dig>  which did not group with any of the other mammalian genes . all of our phylogenetic analyses supported the designation of lyzl <dig> as a unique lysozyme-like gene duplicate, as the platypus gene did not fall within any of the other monophyletic gene groups. the relationship of the platypus lyzl <dig> gene to the other lysozyme-like genes was highly labile in the phylogenetic analyses . this result is in accord with the fact that the platypus lyzl <dig> gene  showed little similarity to any of the other lysozyme-like genes  in our blast searches. when the platypus lyzl <dig> gene was used as a query to search mammalian genomes, only one genomic sequence -- from the sloth  -- was found to have greater similarity to lyzl <dig> than to any other lysozyme-like gene. when the short sloth sequence was used as a query against the platypus genome, its best match was the lyzl <dig> gene. however, the sloth genomic contig was short, containing only a single exon, and therefore could not be used for phylogenetic or genomic neighborhood analysis; thus, the evidence supporting orthology of the sloth sequence to the platypus lyzl <dig> gene is very weak. thus, at present, it is not clear whether this gene duplication happened on the ancestral mammal lineage, with subsequent losses on most descendant lineages, or on the monotreme lineage.

lactalbumin  and calcium-binding lysozyme  genes
mammalian lalba genes have been well characterized, and are typically single copy in mammals  <cit>  . curiously, it was previously reported that multiple lalba genes exist in the bovine and ovine genomes  <cit> , but here we found only a single copy of the lalba gene in the cow genome . whether this reflects differences in the sources of dna in the different studies or is due to incomplete genome assembly is unknown. the only genome that revealed a duplicate lalba gene was the pika . despite hypotheses about an early origin of the lalba gene  <cit> , no good candidates for non-mammalian orthologs were identified by our phylogenetic  or genomic neighborhood  analyses.

an intriguing observation from our genomic neighborhood analysis of was that the mammalian calcium-binding lysozyme gene  is located adjacent to the lalba gene in the dog  and horse  genomes. both previous phylogenetic analyses  <cit>  and our new phylogenetic analyses  suggested that the lysc <dig> gene originated prior to the radiation of mammals. however, our tblastn searches using either dog or horse lysc <dig> identified similar sequences in the genomes of only a few diverse mammals -- dog, cat, horse, shrew, sloth, and mouse lemur . it is also noteworthy that the mammalian  and avian calcium-binding lysozyme genes are not closely related in our phylogenies, a finding in agreement with some earlier analyses  <cit> . thus, it is reasonable to speculate that calcium binding evolved independently in these bird and mammal lysozymes. the newly identified lysc1-like genomic sequences all were found on short genomic contigs ; nonetheless, both the cat and mouse lemur genomic contigs also encode part of the c12orf <dig> gene , which is adjacent to the lysc <dig> gene in both the dog and horse genomes . this suggests that the lysc <dig> gene may be near the c12orf <dig> gene in other mammalian genomes. using a strategy that has previously worked to identify genes that could not be found through typical blast searches  <cit> , we focused carefully on the sequences between the lalba and c12orf <dig> genes. in  <dig> of the  <dig> mammalian genomes available from ensembl  <cit> , the lalba and c12orf <dig> genes were contained in contiguous genomic sequences. in  <dig> of the  <dig> species this genomic region was fragmented into several small genomic contigs; thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that in these genomes the two genes are contiguous. in the pig and the little brown bat this genomic region was not fragmented. in the pig, the current genome assembly does not encode the lalba gene and the c12orf <dig> gene is embedded within a very large genomic fragment, suggesting that the lalba - c12orf <dig> genomic region has been reorganized in the pig genome . in the little brown bat, the lalba gene is embedded in a large genomic fragment that was not annotated to include c12orf <dig> . a more careful examination of the little brown bat genomic contig revealed that most of the genomic region is composed of unsequenced gaps.

for the  <dig> genomes that did have linked lalba and c12orf <dig> genes, the distance between these two genes ranged from ~ <dig> kb  to ~ <dig> kb . for all of these genomes, except the opossum , the only genes  annotated as existing between lalba and c12orf <dig> were olfactory receptor-like genes, which are not very useful for identifying orthologous and conserved genomic neighborhoods due to their abundance. in the opossum, in addition to the olfactory receptor-like genes, three additional genes were annotated between lalba and c12orf41: the genes mip, spryd <dig>  and gls <dig>  unfortunately, the wallaby genome is poorly assembled near the lalba and c12orf <dig> genes, and thus the neighboring genes could not be identified. although the mip, spryd <dig>  and gls <dig> genes reside on the same chromosome as lalba and c12orf <dig> in many mammals , they are found greater than  <dig> mb away; furthermore, in some species  they are on different chromosomes. these observations suggest that the organization of the lalba, c12orf <dig>  mip, spryd <dig>  and gls <dig> genes, and potentially a lysc <dig> gene, has changed between the opossum  and placental mammals.

the genomic sequence between the lalba and c12orf <dig> genes for the  <dig> genomes where these two genes were linked was aligned with multipipmaker  <cit> . sequences with similarity to the lysc <dig> gene were not observed in  <dig> of the genomic sequences -- those from marmoset, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, treeshrew, cow, little brown bat, and opossum . it should be noted, however, that for  <dig> of these species  these genomic sequences contain large amounts of unknown sequence . thus, there are only  <dig> species with nearly complete genomic sequences spanning the lalba and c12orf <dig> genes for which we have good evidence for the actual absence of a lysc <dig> gene or pseudogene -- mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, treeshrew, and opossum. pairwise sequence alignments between the mouse, rat, or guinea pig genomic sequences with those from dog or horse  using pipmaker  <cit>  revealed that a large genomic region, which could potentially encode a lysc <dig> gene, is missing from these rodent genomes . this suggests that this genomic region, including the lysc <dig> gene, was deleted either early on the rodent lineage or in the common ancestor of rodents and close relatives , but after the divergence of the rodent lineage from the primate lineage .

interestingly, some of the genomes -- including those from certain haplorrhine primate species  and the elephant -- do possess sequences between the lalba and c12orf <dig> genes that aligned with three of the four exons  of the horse and dog lysc <dig> genes . all of these genomic sequences, except for that of the tarsier, are on large genomic segments that have only a few short unsequenced gaps. it is unlikely that all of these genomic sequences have been similarly misassembled, thus we conclude that exon  <dig> was deleted from all of these genes, and therefore the lysc <dig> gene is a pseudogene in all of these species . in addition to missing exon  <dig>  all of these lysc1-like gene sequences have both frameshift insertions and/or deletions and in-frame stop codons, strengthening the conclusion that they are pseudogenes . the loss of exon  <dig> from the lysc <dig> gene of haplorrhine primates and elephant must have been independent events  as the mouse lemur, a strepsirrhine primate, has a lysc <dig> gene that has an intact exon  <dig> , plus the primates and elephants are quite distant relatives.

intact lysc <dig> genes that predict potentially functional calcium-binding lysozymes were found in only a few species , whereas pseudogenes were found on several lineages . phylogenetic and genomic analyses suggested that the pair of lysc <dig> genes found in the shrew resulted from a tandem gene duplication event on the lineage leading to this species ; the divergence of the predicted protein sequences of the two genes suggests that they are not undergoing concerted evolution, however. the lysc <dig> gene was deleted from the genome on the lineages leading to rodents  and treeshrews. taken together, the above observations suggest that the lysc <dig> gene likely arose from a duplication of the lactalbumin gene early in mammalian evolution, and was inactivated several times independently, as summarized in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
here we have shown that the mammalian lysozyme gene family is much larger than previously anticipated, and is composed of at least eight distantly-related members  in most mammalian species. these observations suggest that this family experienced several duplication events prior to the origin of mammals. several other gene families also experienced such amplifications near the origin of mammals, such as those generating the gene families for keratin-associated proteins  <cit> , kallikriens  <cit> , and bitter taste receptors  <cit> . amplification of these latter genes has been suggested to be associated with development of new mammal-specific features -- e.g., hair , skin , and diet   <cit> . intriguingly, lactalbumin is essential for lactose synthesis in mammary glands, a mammal-specific trait  <cit> . these observations raise the possibility that other members of the lysozyme-like family have also evolved mammal-specific roles. the new lysozyme-like genes have been largely conserved within mammals, suggesting that they provide important biological functions. the products of the spaca <dig> and lyzl <dig> genes have recently been shown to be involved in fertilization in mice  <cit> . much further study is needed to identify the enzymatic activities  and biological functions of these newly identified lysozyme-like proteins.

similar to the keratin-associated protein  <cit>  and bitter taste receptor  <cit>  gene families, genes for the lysozyme-like proteins are dispersed over several chromosomes . the mechanisms by which these original gene duplications occurred are unclear, as the genes that flank the dispersed lysozyme-like genes show no homology to each other, implying that they were not generated by large segmental duplication events . the lysozyme-like gene family also shares with the keratin associated protein  <cit> , kallikrein  <cit> , and bitter taste receptor  <cit>  gene families the propensity for lineage-specific gene duplications . the lineage-specific expansions, in contrast to the initial duplications, have frequently been tandem in nature. such tandem organization increases the likelihood that the duplicated genes could be involved in concerted evolution  <cit> , which our phylogenetic analyses suggest have occurred in the lyz and lyzl1/ <dig> subfamilies. the lyz subfamily showed the greatest tendency to tandemly duplicate and evolve in concert, whereas the other lysozyme-like genes typically showed conservation in copy number. tandem duplication or amplification of the lyz gene has previously been observed in certain mammals, including the ruminants and rodents, where lysozyme appears to function as a digestive enzyme in the gut  <cit> . it is of interest to note that many of the species that we found to possess multiple lyz genes -- e.g., elephant and wallaby -- are also herbivorous species, and thus may use lysozyme as a digestive enzyme upon gut bacteria. the need for higher levels of digestive lysozymes in the guts of fermenting herbivores could have driven the fixation of the tandem duplications in these lineages. gene conversion between the tandem duplicates might then provide a mechanism whereby favorable mutations in one gene copy could spread to the other copies in the cluster  <cit> , as well as a mechanism for retention of sequence similarity  <cit>  in well-adapted proteins.
