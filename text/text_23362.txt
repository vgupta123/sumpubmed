BACKGROUND
kinesin- <dig>  also known as conventional kinesin, is a member of the kinesin super family proteins . kifs move along microtubules  by atp hydrolysis and are essential for the transport of a variety of cargos such as protein complexes and membranous organelles  <cit> . in neurons, kinesin- <dig> plays a role in axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria  <cit> . kinesin- <dig> is a heterotetramer composed of two kinesin heavy chains  and two kinesin light chains . the khcs contain an n-terminal motor domain and a c-terminal tail region, which is required for the interaction with klcs. the klcs are required for the interaction with cargo proteins. efficient intracellular transport depends on a dynamic association-dissociation cycle of motor and cargos that may involve certain regulatory molecules  <cit> . kinesin- <dig> often employs specific adaptor proteins to carry cargos  <cit> . as such, the interaction between kinesin- <dig> and adaptor proteins can potentially serve as a regulatory point for motor-cargo assembly. however, this potential mechanism has not been directly investigated.

jnk interacting protein   <dig> binds to the klc through its c-terminal kinesin-binding site  <cit> . jip <dig> also binds to a variety of other proteins through its jnk binding domain  and phosphotyrosine binding  domain  <cit> . therefore, jip <dig> may function as an adaptor that physically connects jip1-binding cargo proteins and kinesin- <dig> to enable the transport of specific proteins. genetic analyses of drosophila axonal transport have revealed the physiological significance of jip <dig> in supporting kinesin-1-dependent intracellular vesicle transport  <cit> . the binding mode of jip <dig> to potential cargo proteins has been precisely analyzed. the jbd is required for interaction with jnk  <cit> , while the ptb domain is required for interaction with various ptb domain binding proteins, including amyloid precursor protein , apolipoprotein e receptor  <dig> , p190rhogef, dual leucine zipper bearing kinase , and jip <dig>   <cit> . the ptb domain binds to proteins containing an npxy motif  through an interaction dependent on a conserved phenylalanine residue in the ptb domain  <cit> . the corresponding phenylalanine residue of jip <dig>  f <dig>  is required for interaction with the npty motif of app and the neaf motif of p190rhogef  <cit> . the ptb domain of jip <dig> also binds to proteins which do not have typical npxy motif including dlk and jip <dig>  these observations suggest a critical regulatory role for jip <dig> in kinesin-1-dependent intracellular transport, and the importance of jip1-binding proteins in regulating the formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex. however, the effects of jip1-binding proteins on the formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex have not been fully determined.

in this study, we tested the significance of jip <dig> binding proteins for the formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex in mammalian cells. we demonstrated that conserved amino acid residues in the ptb domain, including f <dig>  but not the jbd of jip <dig> enhance the formation of a stable complex with kinesin- <dig>  while the c-terminal residues show an absolute requirement for this interaction. we then identified another kinesin- <dig> binding protein, jip <dig>  responsible for the f687-dependent enhancement of the formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex. we further analyzed the molecular basis of the enhancement of jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex formation. the results not only suggest a regulatory role of jip <dig> in the formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex, but also suggest a possible regulatory mechanism mediated by jip1-binding proteins that bind to the jip1-ptb domain.

RESULTS
formation of the jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex in neuro2a cells is independent of the jip1-jbd and cellular jnk activity
to examine the requirement of jip <dig> binding proteins for the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  we made a series of deletions or amino acid substitutions in the jbd and ptb domains of jip <dig> . the c-terminal  <dig> residues, which include the kinesin- <dig> binding site  <cit> , were deleted in the dct mutant, which served as a negative control. the mutated jip <dig> proteins were tagged with gfp at their n termini and transiently expressed in differentiated neuro2a cells. the association between the jip <dig> mutants and kinesin- <dig> was estimated by an immunoprecipitation assay using anti-gfp antibody . the results demonstrated that gfp-jip1-wt and gfp-jip1-djbd showed comparable binding activity to kinesin- <dig>  while binding activity was almost completely absent from gfp-jip1-dct . control gfp did not bind to kinesin- <dig>  it has been reported that gfp-tagged jip <dig> localizes to the neurite tips of cultured neuronal cells when the c-terminal kinesin- <dig> binding site is intact  <cit> . we confirmed the localization of gfp-jip <dig> to neurite tips in a kinesin- <dig> binding site-dependent manner . this suggests that we can evaluate the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> in vivo by monitoring the subcellular localization of jip <dig>  thus, the localization of wt and mutant gfp-jip <dig> at neurite tips was evaluated as the relative fluorescence ratio between the tips and shafts of neurites, using free gfp as a control . deletion of the n-terminal region of jip <dig> that includes the jbd did not affect the localization of jip <dig> to neurite tips, as expected from the binding data described above . rather, the neurite tip localization of gfp-jip1-djbd was somewhat greater than gfp-jip1-wt, although the difference was not statistically significant . because the jip1-jbd can bind to jnk, we next tested the association between jip <dig> and jnk by evaluating the co-precipitation of endogenous jnk with mutant or wt gfp-jip <dig> . jnk was co-precipitated with jip1-wt, the dct mutant and the ptb domain mutants, but not with the djbd mutant, confirming that the djbd mutant had lost the ability to bind jnk. taken together, these results indicate that the jbd of jip <dig> is not essential for the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> 

a possible role for jnk in the interaction between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> has been proposed. in drosophila, over-expression of hemipterous, an upstream kinase of the jnk ortholog, basket, disrupts the binding of the jip <dig> ortholog, aplip <dig>  to kinesin- <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that the binding of jip <dig> to kinesin- <dig> depends on the activation state of jnk. however, the djbd mutant of jip <dig> that lost the ability to bind jnk apparently retained full binding activity to kinesin- <dig>  as described above. further, neither inhibition nor activation of jnk affected the co-precipitation of kinesin- <dig> with jip <dig> in neuro2a cells . these results are consistent with the notion that jnk activity does not affect the binding of jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> in mammalian systems.

the ptb domain of jip <dig> is required for complex formation with kinesin-1
we next examined the requirement of the ptb domain for the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  because deletion of the jip <dig> ptb domain resulted in insoluble aggregate formation in neuro2a cells, we used amino acid substitution to generate ptb domain mutants that lacked protein-binding activity . by aligning the sequence of the jip <dig> ptb domain with those of other proteins such as dab <dig> and shc, divergence between the n-terminal regions of the ptb domains in these proteins became apparent . this suggests that the n-terminal region of the ptb domain is responsible for jip <dig> specific functions. alignment of jip <dig> ptb domain sequences from various species revealed that v <dig> in this region is highly conserved . therefore, we substituted this amino acid with a to make the jip1-v581a mutant, which was predicted to lose the ability to bind to some jip1-specific binding proteins. two conserved phenylalanine residues, f <dig> and f <dig>  located in the c-terminal region of the jip <dig> ptb domain are required for its binding to the npty motif of app  <cit> . we replaced these f residues with v to make the jip1-f642v and jip1-f687v mutants, respectively . we used these jip <dig> mutants to examine the requirement of the ptb domain for the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> using two independent methods described previously. as shown in figure 1b and c, kinesin- <dig> binding to the gfp-jip1-ptb domain mutants  was somewhat greater than to the dct mutant or gfp, but far less than to gfp-jip1-wt. the localization of gfp-jip <dig> at neurite tips was also dependent on the ptb domain: none of jip1-ptb domain mutants  showed obvious localization to the tips of neurites . the neurite tip localizations of these mutants were greater than the dct mutant or gfp, but far less than gfp-jip1-wt . taken together, these results indicate that the ptb domain, in addition to the c-terminal region, contributes to the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> in differentiated neuro2a cells.

identification of jip <dig> as a principal binding protein of jip1
the v <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> mutations in the ptb domain drastically reduced the binding of jip <dig> to kinesin- <dig>  because the jip1-ptb domain cannot directly interact with kinesin- <dig>  <cit> , we hypothesized that a protein binds to the ptb domain of jip <dig> and enhances the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  we therefore searched for jip <dig> binding proteins in neuro2a cells. sds-page analysis of proteins co-precipitated with tap-tagged jip <dig> revealed a protein with an apparent molecular weight of ~180 kda as a major binding partner of jip <dig> . this protein was identified as jip <dig> by mass spectrometry . jip <dig> has been reported to bind to the jip <dig> ptb domain in vitro  <cit> , but whether v <dig>  f <dig> or f <dig> are required for this binding is unknown. thus, we examined the binding between gfp-jip <dig> mutants and endogenous jip <dig> in neuro2a cells by co-precipitation assays. co-precipitation of jip <dig> was observed with gfp-jip1-wt, gfp-jip1-djbd and gfp-jip1-dct, but not with the v581a, f642v and f687v mutants or gfp . these results indicate that the jip1–jip <dig> interaction in neuro2a cells depends on v <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> in the jip <dig> ptb domain. accordingly, jip <dig>  a major jip1-binding protein in differentiated neuro2a cells, is a candidate protein that could enhance the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> 

to test this possibility, we performed co-precipitation assays using lysates from hek293t cells, which did not contain detectable levels of jip <dig>  jip <dig>  and kinesin- <dig> proteins. cells were transfected with expression vectors for tap-tagged jip <dig>  v5-tagged klc, and v5-tagged khc, together with an expression vector for gfp-jip <dig> or gfp. as shown in figure 2c, the amount of kinesin- <dig>  co-precipitated with jip <dig> was significantly increased by co-expression of jip <dig> . because the molecular weight of v5-khc was very close to that of tap-tagged jip <dig>  we routinely detected v5-klc when detecting tap-jip <dig> in the same gel. notably, gfp-jip <dig> was also found in the jip <dig> binding fraction . these results clearly demonstrate that jip <dig> can enhance the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> 

although we were able to identify jip <dig> as a major jip <dig> ptb domain binding protein in differentiated neuro2a cells, several proteins other than jip <dig> have been reported as jip <dig> ptb domain binding proteins in other cell systems  <cit> . these proteins include dlk and app. dlk is a protein kinase that activates the jnk pathway  <cit> . dlk binding to jip <dig> is mostly lost by deletion of the c-terminal part of jip <dig> that includes the ptb domain  <cit> . app is a vesicle-associated protein that binds to jip <dig> in a manner dependent on the f <dig> and f <dig> residues of jip <dig>  <cit> . to compare the jip <dig> binding activity of these proteins, we performed co-precipitation assays using cell lysates prepared from hek293t cells expressing gfp-fusion constructs of these jip <dig> binding proteins, together with tap-jip <dig>  v5-klc and v5-khc. because of the low expression of full-length human app , we used the cytoplasmic region of app , which contains the jip <dig> binding region  <cit> . as shown in figure 2c , the amounts of gfp-dlk and gfp-app-c in the jip1-bound fraction were far less than gfp-jip <dig>  although their expression levels were rather higher . moreover, the expression of dlk or app-c showed little effect on the amount of kinesin- <dig> co-precipitated with jip <dig> . these results suggest a unique function of jip <dig> compared to other jip1-binding proteins.

the association of jip <dig> with jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> was evaluated in vivo by immunoprecipitation of an e <dig> mouse brain extract with anti-jip <dig> antibody. the results clearly demonstrated that the immunoprecipitated complex containing jip <dig> also contained jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> . this result may imply the physiological significance of the association between jip <dig> and jip <dig> 

jip <dig> enhances the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> in neuro2a cells
to test whether jip3–jip <dig> binding is essential for the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  we investigated the effect of jip <dig> knockdown. neuro2a cells stably expressing rfp-tagged jip <dig>  were transiently transfected with expression vectors for jip <dig> shrna  or non-silencing shrna . immunoprecipitation of rfp-jip <dig> followed by western blotting using anti-khc antibody revealed that the binding of rfp-jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> was severely reduced by jip <dig> knockdown . we also tested whether the jip <dig> knockdown altered the neurite tip localization of rfp-jip <dig>  differentiated rfp-jip1-neuro2a cells were transiently transfected with shrna vectors  containing a gfp expression cassette to help identify the transfected cells. the localization of rfp-jip <dig> to the neurite tip of gfp-labeled cells was significantly reduced in shjip3-transfected cells compared with ns transfected cells . the neurite tip localization of gfp was not observed in either the control cells or the jip3-knockdown cells. the kinesin- <dig> binding and neurite tip localization of rfp-jip <dig> reduced by jip <dig> knockdown were almost recovered by the tap-jip3-wt expression without recovering the endogenous jip <dig> level . these results indicate that jip <dig> is crucial for the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> in neuro2a cells.

molecular basis for jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex formation
as shown in figure 2c, the ectopic expression of jip <dig> in hek293t cells enhanced the association between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  to confirm that the effect of jip <dig> depends on the binding of jip <dig> to the jip <dig> ptb domain, we performed co-precipitation assays using the jip1-f687v mutant, which showed negligible binding to jip <dig> . although the expression of gfp-jip <dig> enhanced the binding of tap-tagged jip1-wt to kinesin- <dig>  , the effect of jip <dig> expression was negated by the jip <dig> f687v mutation . concomitant binding of gfp-jip <dig> was significantly reduced by the f687v mutation . nonetheless, in the absence of jip <dig>  the weak kinesin-1-binding activity of the jip1-f687v mutant was comparable with that of jip1-wt, indicating that the f687v mutation does not affect the basal binding capacity of jip <dig> to kinesin- <dig> . this basal kinesin- <dig> binding capacity was dependent on the c-terminal sequence of jip <dig> . these results indicate that jip1–jip <dig> complex formation via f <dig> significantly increases the kinesin-1-binding capacity of jip <dig>  compared with jip <dig> alone.

we confirmed that roughly equal amounts of v5-khc and v5-klc were present in the jip <dig> pull-down fraction . this suggests that v5-khc and v5-klc form the kinesin- <dig> holoenzyme in hek293t cells and bind to jip <dig> 

we then sought to clarify why the jip1–jip <dig> complex showed such higher kinesin-1-binding activity. because both jip <dig> and jip <dig> can bind to kinesin- <dig>  <cit> , we tested whether the binding of jip <dig> to kinesin- <dig> is essential for the stable binding of the jip1–jip <dig> complex to kinesin- <dig>  to disrupt the binding of jip <dig> to kinesin- <dig>  we constructed a jip3-lz4a mutant by substituting four l residues in the jip <dig> kinesin- <dig> binding site, l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  with a . these l residues are conserved between jip <dig> and a highly related protein, jip <dig>  and are directly involved in jip4–kinesin- <dig> binding  <cit> . as shown in figure 4b , the jip3-lz4a mutant failed to bind to kinesin- <dig>  although the jip1-binding capacity of the jip3-lz4a mutant was comparable with wild-type jip <dig>  the ability to enhance the binding of jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> was completely lost in this mutant . this result indicates that jip3–kinesin- <dig> binding, as well as jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding, is essential for the stable association of the jip1–jip <dig> complex with kinesin- <dig> . this notion is confirmed by the observation that tap-jip3-lz4a fails to offset the effect of jip <dig> knockdown on the jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding and the neurite tip localization of rfp-jip <dig> .

finally, we examined whether the jip1–jip <dig> complex is stabilized by kinesin- <dig>  as shown in figure 4a  and figure 4c, disruption of the kinesin- <dig> binding site in both jip <dig> and jip <dig> did not affect the binding of jip <dig> to jip <dig>  moreover, concomitant disruption of jip <dig> and jip <dig> binding to kinesin- <dig> also had no effect on the binding of jip <dig> to jip <dig>  while the binding of kinesin- <dig> was completely abolished . these results indicate that jip <dig> and jip <dig> can form a stable protein complex, even in the absence of kinesin- <dig> 

dlk affects the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex
the results presented above suggest the presence of a jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex. we then tested whether the formation of the ternary complex was regulated by an additional factor, which may serve as a regulator of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> complex formation. because the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex was highly dependent on ptb domain-dependent binding of jip <dig> and jip <dig>  we hypothesized that other ptb domain-dependent jip <dig> binding proteins would interrupt the formation of the ternary complex. if the ptb binding protein has no kinesin- <dig> binding activity, the binding of kinesin- <dig> to this protein complex will be restricted. one of the candidates for such a protein is dlk, which is reported to stably interact with jip <dig> via the ptb domain, particularly when its kinase activity is suppressed  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a and b, over-expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of dlk  in neuro2a cells did partially suppress jip1–jip <dig> binding and jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding. it also suppressed the neurite tip localization of jip <dig> . a significant suppressive effect was observed only with the kinase-inactive mutant of dlk, while the effect of wild-type dlk over-expression on these binding events was not significant. this may reflect the complex regulation of the protein-binding activity of jip <dig> and dlk by their phosphorylation status  <cit> . in any case, these results suggest a potential regulatory role for dlk in the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex.

discussion
in this study, we investigated the contribution of jip <dig> binding proteins to the interaction between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  although the binding of jnk to the jbd of jip <dig> showed no significant effect on the kinesin- <dig> binding, the binding of jip <dig> to the ptb domain of jip <dig> enhanced it significantly. dlk, another jip1-ptb domain binding protein, did not show such an effect. however, the over-expression of kinase-inactive dlk perturbed the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex, suggesting that dlk might compete with jip <dig> for the jip1-ptb domain. taken together with the reported function of jip <dig> as a cargo adaptor  <cit> , these results suggest that the potency of the interaction between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig> depends on which protein binds to the jip1-ptb domain.

jip <dig> and jip <dig> were originally identified as jnk binding proteins that function as a scaffold for the jnk activating protein kinase cascade in mammalian cells  <cit> . while jip <dig> is now recognized as a cargo adaptor that connects cargo and kinesin- <dig>  <cit> , the relationship between these distinct jip <dig> functions remained unclear. it has been reported that the activation of jnk leads to the unloading of kinesin- <dig> from mts  <cit> . however, the contribution of jip <dig> or jip <dig> to this process is ambiguous. a previous study in drosophila suggested the possibility that jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding is disrupted by jnk activation via an unidentified jnk target  <cit> . because the drosophila jip <dig> ortholog, aplip <dig>  lacks the jbd, the effect of jnk may not be dependent on jip1–jnk binding. we show here that the binding of jip <dig> to kinesin- <dig> is not affected by the binding of jnk to jip <dig>  regardless of jnk activity, in mammalian cells. jip1–jip <dig> binding was also independent of jip1–jnk binding . we still cannot rule out the possibility that jip3–jnk binding affects jip1–jip <dig> binding or jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding. however, such scenarios may be unlikely because it has been reported that deletion of the jbd in jip <dig> does not affect jip <dig> transport in neural cells  <cit> , and because the jip1–jip <dig> interaction in neuro 2a cells was independent of jnk activity . taken together, jnk seems to be a cargo of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> complex rather than a regulator of jip1-jip3-kinesin- <dig> complex formation.

in contrast to the dispensability of the jip <dig> jbd, the ptb domain is essential for kinesin- <dig> binding by jip <dig> in differentiated neuro2a cells. we identified jip <dig> as a major ptb-dependent jip <dig> binding protein that was largely essential for the neurite tip localization and kinesin-1-binding of jip <dig>  jip <dig> or jip <dig> bound to kinesin- <dig> via their kinesin-1-binding motifs, without forming a jip1–jip <dig> complex. however, this “basal” kinesin- <dig> binding activity was significantly enhanced by jip1–jip <dig> complex formation, which was totally dependent on the jip1-ptb domain. a previous study showed that distinct regions of the tpr domains in klc are responsible for jip <dig> and jip <dig> binding  <cit> . therefore, jip <dig> and jip <dig> may bind to kinesin- <dig> in a co-operative manner to form a stable ternary complex. this notion is further supported by the observation that the neurite tip localization of jip <dig> is decreased by jip <dig> knockdown   <cit> . it has been reported that jip <dig> binds not only to kinesin light chain  but also to kinesin heavy chain   <cit> . while we cannot rule out a possibility that jip3–khc binding contributes to the ternary complex formation, our results with a mutant jip <dig> bearing amino acid substitution in the klc contact site indicate that jip3–klc binding is essential for the ternary complex formation. as for jip1–jip <dig> binding, it has been reported that the central  <dig> amino acids of jip <dig>  which include the jbd and kinesin- <dig> binding regions, and the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of jip <dig>  which include the ptb domain and kinesin- <dig> binding region, are sufficient for their binding  <cit> . our results using jip1-ptb domain point mutants further delineate the jip3-binding domain in jip <dig>  by using domain specific mutants of jip <dig> and jip <dig>  we showed that jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex formation depends on jip1–jip3-binding, jip1–kinesin-1-binding, and jip3–kinesin-1-binding. although the abrogation of one of these interactions prevented ternary complex formation, jip1–jip <dig> binding was independent of their binding to kinesin- <dig>  this indicates that jip1–jip <dig> complex formation leads to the formation of the ternary complex. it has been reported that jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding can trigger the activation of kinesin- <dig> motor activity in the presence of additional factors such as fez <dig>  <cit> . therefore, jip1–jip <dig> complex formation might also be critical for the jip1-dependent activation of kinesin- <dig> 

because the kinesin- <dig> binding activity of jip <dig> is crucial for the formation of the ternary complex, other proteins that compete with jip <dig> for binding to the jip1-ptb domain and lack the capacity to bind kinesin- <dig> may negatively regulate the potency of jip <dig> for kinesin- <dig> binding. using dlk, we demonstrated a potential regulatory role for jip1-ptb domain binding proteins in the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex. in addition, kinesin- <dig> or jip3-binding proteins may also affect the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> complex. the inhibition of jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding by ca2+−dependent binding of s100a <dig> to klc, and the inhibition of jip3–kinesin-1-binding by gtp-dependent binding of arf <dig> to jip <dig>  have been reported  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that kinesin-1-dependent transport is regulated by multiple signaling pathways via jip <dig>  jip <dig> and klc.

in this study, we have shown that jip <dig> is a major binding protein of jip <dig> in neuro2a cells, and that jip <dig> has the highest jip1-binding capacity among various known jip1-ptb domain binding proteins. because jip <dig> and jip <dig> are highly expressed in neurons  <cit> , these observations imply that jip <dig> and jip <dig> play a common role in kinesin- <dig> dependent intracellular transport. in fact, genetic studies in drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans have indicated that both jip <dig> and jip <dig> support vesicle transport in neural cells  <cit> . however, knockdown of jip <dig> or jip <dig> result in different phenotypes in mammalian neurons: jip <dig> knockdown results in the partial inhibition of axon elongation, while jip <dig> knockdown results in the stimulation of neurite elongation and branching  <cit> . in our experiments, although jip <dig> was a major jip <dig> binding protein in neuro2a cells, only a fraction of the endogenous jip <dig> was co-precipitated with endogenous jip <dig> . this implies that a considerable fraction of jip <dig> exists in protein complexes free of jip <dig>  and may have an additional function unrelated to jip <dig>  therefore, the jip1–jip <dig> complex might not be a universal kinesin- <dig> regulatory module, but rather a specific regulator of intracellular transport in neuronal cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we investigated the contribution of jip <dig> binding proteins to the interaction between jip <dig> and kinesin- <dig>  the binding of jip <dig> to the ptb domain of jip <dig> enhanced the jip1–kinesin- <dig> interaction significantly, while the binding of jnk to the jbd of jip <dig> showed no significant effect. dlk, another jip1-ptb domain binding protein, did not show any effect on jip1–kinesin- <dig> binding by itself. however, the over-expression of kinase-inactive dlk perturbed the formation of the jip1–jip3–kinesin- <dig> ternary complex, suggesting that dlk might compete with jip <dig> for the jip1-ptb domain. our results suggest that the proteins that bind to the jip1-ptb domain function as regulators of jip1–kinesin- <dig> complex formation.
