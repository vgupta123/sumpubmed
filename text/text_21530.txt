BACKGROUND
evolution has selected the nucleosome structure as the universal eukaryotic genome organization. from yeast to mammals, the nucleosome structure is practically identical. the protein components of nucleosomes, histones, with a highly conserved amino acid sequence, are subjected to a wide variety of specific and reversible post-translational modifications; i.e., acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, deimination, adp-ribosylation, among others . besides dna methylation, the pattern of histone modifications has also been called epigenetic information. it is generally agreed that this information plays important roles in chromatin functions, such as activation or repression of gene transcription or nucleosome assembly during replication. however, the mechanisms by which modifications of histones can participate in these processes, especially in transcription regulation, are not yet known, although two main mechanisms have been proposed. one is that histone modifications can directly affect the nucleosomal structure or the folding properties of chromatin to facilitate dna accessibility by allowing for trans-acting factors to gain access to dna  <cit> . in the second one, histone modifications can act as a signaling system by actively participating in the recognition of, and the interaction with, trans-acting regulators factors . numerous discoveries made in the past decade support the notion that such modifications regulate transcription through the recruitment of effectors protein complexes . obviously, both proposed mechanisms of action are not mutually exclusive.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay coupled to microarray analysis of immunoprecipitated dna  has become an invaluable tool for the in vivo mapping of histone modifications genome-wide . by way of example, oj rando and collaborators  <cit>  analyzed  <dig> histone modifications at nucleosomal resolution by hybridizing a high-density tiling microarray with mononucleosome fragments obtained after micrococcal nuclease treatment. however, the arrays used in that study covered only a small percentage of the yeast genome. a more complete map of histone modifications, describing five histone h <dig> methylations; mono-, di- and tri-methylation of lysine  <dig> , tri-methylation of lysine  <dig>  and tri-methylation of lysine  <dig> , two histone acetylation; lysine  <dig> of h <dig>  and lysine  <dig> of h <dig>  and hyperacetylated histone h <dig>  has been reported in  <cit> . the most important results obtained were that h3k9ac, h3k14ac and the hyperacetylation of h <dig> and also h3k4me <dig>  were found at the promoters and the 5′ end of transcription units, that h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> were more enriched in the middle of genes, and that h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> were found throughout the coding region to peak near the 3′ ends of the transcription units. moreover, all the histone modifications correlated with transcriptional activity, except for h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  <cit> . however, as previously discussed widely  or chip-seq  <cit> .

despite the power of chip-chip for mapping global patterns of histone modifications, the above-cited studies generally provide only a static picture of levels of modifications under a given set of conditions. however, in order to understand the role of histone modifications in transcriptional regulation and the causality between the two processes, it is paramount to study both process dynamically. to address this question, we used tiling dna microarrays to analyze eight genome-wide specific histone modifications; h3k9ac, h3k14ac, acetylation of lysine  <dig> of h <dig> , h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  di-methylation of lysine  <dig> of h <dig>  and h3k79me3; before and after a physiological perturbation  that causes genome-wide transcriptional changes. we selected these acetylation sites because they are representative of the target of the three histone acetyltransferases which have been related to transcription activity; gcn5p  <cit> , sas3p  <cit>  and esa1p . methylation sites were selected because the methylation of the histones in s. cerevisiae is carried out by three known histone methyltransferases  that modify h3k <dig> , h3k <dig>  <cit>  and h3k <dig> , respectively. this paper demonstrates that gene repression was accompanied by a dramatic drop in acetylation, mainly at the transcription start site  and its surroundings, whereas the profiles of methylation hardly changed, and that only slight decreases were observed along the transcribed region, with modifications correlating positively with transcription. gene activation was accompanied by an increased level of acetylation at the tss, but it was less intense than that of the deacetylation of repressed genes. once again, only a moderate increase in the methylations correlating with transcription was noted. we also analyzed, for the first time in s. cerevisiae, the genome-wide profile of a histone modification, which has been related to transcription regulation  <cit> : h4k8ac.

RESULTS
a new genome-wide and comprehensive histone modification map for yeast
as a first step to study chromatin dynamics, we produced new genome-wide maps for the presence of three histone acetylations under standard growing conditions using high tiling density arrays. the precision of the obtained data allowed us to incorporate important nuances into previous studies. we also analyzed, for the first time in s. cerevisiae, the genome-wide profile of h4k8ac. figure  <dig>  shows the profile of the h3k9ac , h3k14ac  and h4k8ac  modifications. we employed a graphical  representation, where profiles were centered on the actual tss  <cit> , and the data for each probe corresponded to the distance from the tss up to the total transcript length, with a maximum of 3000 bp. in this type of representation, the represented number of genes lowered as we moved downstream along the transcribed region. therefore noise increased, but the structure of the actual profile was maintained. as expected, our general results were consistent with those previously described for h3k9ac and h3k14ac  <cit> . we also employed a classical representation of genome-wide data using a metagene profile of widespread use  <cit> , where genes are expanded or compressed to fit onto a hypothetical gene of average length . the comparison made of both types of graphs raised some intriguing questions. for instance, the metagene profile of h3k9ac, h3k14ac and h4k8ac  shows that these modifications peaked just before the tss of the genes, and also at the end of the gene. however, when the data were represented in their real length, the increase at the end of the gene disappeared . to dissect this difference observed between the two representations, we used the real-length representation on sets of genes of different lengths. as the right panels of figure  <dig> depict, an actual increase in the signal levels at the 3′ region was observed for all the transcript lengths and acetylation marks, except for the group containing the shortest transcript for the h3k9ac mark and, to a lesser extent, the longer transcript for the three marks. the increase in signal toward the end of the genes was not observed in this representation for long genes as their transcription termination sites are spread from around  <dig>  to 15kb from the tss and both elongation and terminations marks co-exist at 3kb. the 3′ accumulation of these marks, typically associated with the start of transcription, suggests that they may also be implicated in the final process stage, or may be caused by neighbor promoters or gene loopings with their own promoter. it is also noticeable that the h3k9ac, h3k14ac and h4k8ac levels were inversely related to their length. the fact that the levels of all these modifications were directly related to transcriptional activity can be explained by the major transcriptional activity of short genes if compared to long genes on average, as previously described  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
genome-wide profiles of histone acetylation. the levels of h3k9ac , h3k14ac  and h4k8ac  in relation to the levels of core histone h <dig>  or h <dig> , genome-wide, are shown. the log <dig> values of the specific immunoprecipitation of the modified histone were represented in relation to the immunoprecipitation of the core histone . for the real-lengths representation , the profiles were centered on the actual tss  <cit>  and the data for each probe corresponded to their real distance from the tss for each gene, from 1000 bp upstream up to the total transcript length, to a maximum of 3000 bp downstream. probes were binned to 100 bp. the mean and confidence intervals for the means  were plotted. each experiment compared a chip with a histone modification antibody to a control chip with a core histone antibody. genes were divided into quintiles according to their transcript length .



both h3k9ac and h3k14ac peaked at the probes located between the tss and −100 bp . this location corresponds precisely to the nucleosome-depleted region  associated with the tss  <cit> . however, as we measured the histone modification levels with the levels of the same unmodified core histone  <cit> , this represented only the relative presence of the modification independently of actual nucleosome abundance. although the presence of an ndr in the promoters regions is widespread , a considerable number of genes exhibited a more variable promoter architecture . we hypothesized that the poor presence of histone at this position implies that these data are highly influenced by their neighbors; that is, by nucleosomes- <dig> and + <dig>  in this context, it has been recently proposed that both promoter-bound nucleosomes assume discrete configurations, which not only define the open or closed states of promoters, but distinguish between the “on” and “off” expression states  <cit> . as the opening and closing of the promoter is a dynamic process, one interesting proposal is that the histone modifications of these nucleosomes are involved in switching between the on and off promoter states.

the h4k8ac profile, which has not been mapped genome-wide in yeast, was similar to that of the above-described h3k9ac and h3k14ac, although the association was not as strong as that observed for h3k9ac and h3k14ac . strikingly, the peak of h4k8ac, which we obtained at the tss, contradicts previously reported results  <cit> , which describe a two-nucleosome hypo-acetylated domain for h4k <dig>  h4k <dig> and h2bk <dig> adjacent to the start codons.

we also produced genome-wide maps for h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  under standard growing conditions. as expected, our general results were consistent with those previously described. .

modification of histones in gene clusters
we also investigated the modifications associated with a particularly interesting set of genes. a well-known example for the groups of genes associated with a specific profile of histone modifications is the presence or absence of the canonical tata box in their promoter. we represented  all the profiles of the modifications of the histones analyzed in this work separately for both the tata genes and the tata-less genes. it is remarkable that for all the modifications studied, peaks were higher for the tata-less genes , with the expected exception of h3k4me <dig>  for which the opposite occurred. the tata genes are typically stress-responsive and regulated by a variety of chromatin remodeling factors , and this was also the case under our cell growth conditions  as the median expression of the tata genes was higher than in the tata-less ones  <cit> . such differences should be due to their different promoter architecture.figure  <dig>

in addition to classifying genes according to their promoter structure, bj venters and bf pugh classified them in terms of the differential accumulation of rna pol ii along the promoter and the coding region  <cit> . thus, these authors identified three groups of yeast genes in which rna pol ii was enriched at the promoters in relation to the gene body , enriched immediately downstream of the promoters , or spread throughout the genes . these authors suggested that this subgenic location can reflect rate-limiting steps during transcription, including initiation, elongation and termination. we represent the histone modifications profiles for these three groups in figure 2b and additional file 4: figure s <dig>  in order to correctly interpret these graphs, it is important to consider that, on average, the genes of group  <dig> were the least active , the genes of group  <dig> were the most active , and that our data were always normalized by core histones. it is not surprising, therefore, that the genes in group  <dig> showed a less intense h3k9ac peak at the tss than the other genes . another interesting point is that the group  <dig> genes, which displayed a comparatively even distribution of rna pol ii across their genes, or even enrichment toward the 3′ end, showed a clear increase in h3k9ac , h3k14ac, h4k8ac and h3k79me <dig>  in the body of genes if compared to the other genes. this scenario suggests that the presence of rnapii results in the increased recruitment of hats and dot <dig>  which enhance these modifications. it is also noteworthy that the presence of rna pol ii poised at the promoters in the genes of group  <dig> was accompanied by an increase in signals h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> at the promoters if compared to the other groups of genes . it has also been reported that h3k4me <dig> does not require the ubiquitination of histone h2b, suggesting a paf1-independent targeting of set <dig> to the coding region of active genes  <cit> . an increased h3k4me <dig> signal in the promoters with poised rna pol ii could result from this targeting of set <dig>  while an increase in h3k36me <dig> suggests that set2p is possibly present, together with rna pol ii, in this early process step.

correlation between histone modifications and the transcription rate, mrna amount and rna pol ii presence
transcriptional activity is tightly linked to histone modifications. however, transcriptional activity can be measured by different indicators. the simplest indicator of transcriptional activity is presence of mrna. nevertheless, more direct indicators of transcriptional activity, such as presence of rna pol ii in the body of genes  <cit>  or nascent rna production, are also available  <cit> . many researchers have also utilized a data set  <cit> , which represents the indirect calculation of the rate of appearance of mature mrnas in the cytoplasm. yet all these measures  reflect different biological realities. we compared all four data sets with the level of the eight histone modifications studied in both the promoters region and the orfs in additional file 5: table s <dig>  the results indicate that all the analyzed modifications correlated positively with the four data sets employed, except for h3k4me <dig>  which correlated negatively, as expected  <cit> . moreover, correlations were always better for rna pol ii occupancy than for the other data sets, and the nascent tr data sets generally correlated better than the indirect data sets, especially with h3k36me <dig>  a chromatin mark that has been directly related with transcription elongation  <cit> . the worst correlation of all was noted for amounts of mrna , indicating that post-transcriptional processes, such as mrna stability, must be taken into account for correct data interpretation  <cit> .

to acquire information about the particular positions at which histone modification can recruit transcription factors or can be modified as a result of transcription, we computed the precise location along the gene where each histone modification better correlated with transcription. figure  <dig> shows the spearman rank correlation between the eight histone modifications and the rna pol ii occupancy obtained at different gene locations. several important conclusions can be drawn from this figure. first, h3k9ac, h3k14ac and h4k8ac show a profile with a peak centered at the tss, which decreased downstream. while this figure depicts a less pronounced h3k14ac peak, we performed similar experiments in other yeast strains. the peak obtained for h3k14ac was similar to that of h3k9ac, and was only slightly lower in height . second, h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> exhibited a practically identical profile, and it was not possible to distinguish if one modification preceded the other, or vice versa. h3k79me <dig> displayed a profile of positive correlations with a similar shape to that of h3k4me <dig> or h3k36me <dig>  but of less intensity. this result contradicts a previous study which found no correlation between the level of h3k79me <dig> and transcriptional activity  <cit> . the discrepancy between these two genome-wide profiling studies in yeast, and also in other eukaryotes, has been attributed to the different chromatin preparation methods used and, more specifically, to the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate in formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin  <cit> . as recently discussed however  <cit> , analyses of mouse, fly, and human genome have revealed that h3k <dig> methylation is indeed a marker of active transcription, which thus confirms our results in yeast. finally, as in the gene modifications profiles, h3k79me <dig> once again showed a very similar profile of positive correlations to those of the histone acetylation peaking at the tss.figure  <dig>

our results indicate that the histone modifications which better correlate with transcription activity are those of h3k4me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> , which is in agreement with previous reports  <cit> , and that both modifications can be considered chromatin marks related with transcription elongation . h3k79me <dig> modifications can also be considered chromatin modifications related with transcription elongation, but of less magnitude. the correlation of h3k4me <dig> with rna pol ii was negative and gave a high absolute value: − <dig>  between + <dig> and +600 bp in the orf. according to our results, the most important chromatin modification associated with active promoters was h3k9ac, which reached values of  <dig>  between − <dig> and +200 bp. h3k14ac, h4k8ac and, strikingly, h3k79me <dig> modifications, can also be considered chromatin modifications in relation to active promoters, but of less magnitude.

changes in the modification of histones during the activation or repression of genes
the key question as to the function of histone modifications in transcription regulation is whether or not they are the cause or the consequence of the process itself  <cit> . in order to gain new insights into this central issue, we studied the histone modifications associated with the drastic change in transcription activity associated with osmotic stress. this is an ideal condition as the molecular mechanism is well-known , and also because independent transcriptomic response data sets are available . for our study, we chose the data relating to changes in transcription rate  <cit>  obtained from genomic run-on experiments  <cit> , which offer the chance to study the direct link between transcriptional activity and chromatin . furthermore, the number of genes that are up- and down-regulated by osmotic stress is large enough to reduce noise and allows the identification of statistically relevant trends. in our case, we used  <dig> genes defined as being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes   <cit> . it has also been reported that the activation or repression of osmotic stress genes can be carried out by several mechanisms, which include the recruitment of chromatin-modifying activities . taken together, these findings suggest that histone modifications can play an important role, at least in the activation of the genes induced by osmotic stress. finally, osmotic stress is a quick process in which a transcriptional response is obtained in only 10 min  <cit> . therefore, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis for eight specific histone modifications; h3k9ac, h3k14ac, h4k8ac, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me3; before and after osmotic stress  produced by adding a small volume of a concentrated nacl solution to the yeast culture 10 min before cross-linking with formaldehyde. specifically, we measured the histone modification levels in relation to the levels of the same unmodified core histone.

the up- and down-regulated genes followed a divergent regulation of the acetylation level upon stress treatment. figure  <dig> shows the profiles of h3k9ac, h3k14ac and h4k8c for the genes that were up- or down-regulated in response to osmotic stress before  and after  stress. as seen, the up- and down-regulated genes already exhibited an opposite profile before osmotic stress was applied. this is consistent if we consider that the stress-induced genes generally displayed little or no activity before stress and, vice versa, that the genes repressed by stress were more active before stress. the post-stress situation drastically changed. as seen in the right panels, the h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> acetylations of the down-regulated genes significantly decreased at the tss and in its surroundings. in fact, the acetylation pattern of the three modifications was similar to that of the stressed up-regulated genes before stress, or was even lower. the profiles of the h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> acetylations of the genes up-regulated after stress also underwent important changes as their acetylation level at the tss increased. however, none of the three sites reached the acetylation level of the stressed down-regulated genes before stress. this is perhaps because these genes did not reach a similar transcription rate level to that of the down-regulated genes before stress. these results demonstrate that transcription repression is associated with a quick deacetylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> at the tss. to confirm this, we focused on a particular group of genes, ribosomal proteins , which are, with the group of histones, the highest transcribed group of yeast genes under normal growth conditions  <cit> , but are quickly repressed transcriptionally upon osmotic stress  <cit> . as expected, figure  <dig> shows that the h3k14ac and h3k9ac levels of the rp genes were very high before stress . as seen in the right panels of figure  <dig>  the acetylation profiles dramatically dropped and reached a similar acetylation level to that of the remaining genes in only 10 min. this result is consistent with the fact that histone acetylation is a rapidly reversible process and that acetyl groups turned over rapidly in vivo, with half-lives in the order of minutes  <cit> , thus allowing rapid gene expression changes in response to signals. the h3k9ac profile is especially interesting as it did not follow the same pattern as the remaining genes did because its maximum was presented before stress in the transcribed region in nucleosomes + <dig> and + <dig>  while other genes displayed their maximum immediately before the tss. it is precisely in nucleosomes + <dig> and + <dig> where the major decrease of h3k9ac took place after stress, suggesting that the h3k9ac of these nucleosomes may play an important role in maintaining the active state of these genes or, alternatively, that its deacetylation is important to switch off their inactivation. something similar occurred with h4k8ac, but much less intensely. in this context, + <dig> to + <dig> nucleosome spacing has been described to be significantly shorter over rp genes than over other gene types, and that polymerase loss results in the relaxation of + <dig> to + <dig> spacing in rp genes  <cit> . it has also been shown that the chromatin structure of rp genes in their 5′ part plays a differential role during transcription elongation  <cit> . one reasonable hypothesis is that the h3k9ac of these nucleosomes may play a fundamental role in maintaining the special active chromatin architecture of these genes or, alternatively, that its deacetylation is important for them to be switched off, hence their relaxation.figure  <dig>

the transcription activation of genes is associated with the acetylation of all these three sites at the tss. nevertheless, this process seemed less intense, widespread or slower than that of the deacetylation of the down-regulated genes. both activities  required the presence of the respective enzymes. our results cannot explain the reported recruitment of rpd <dig>  <cit> , a histone deacetylase involved in deacetylating most core histone sites, except lysine  <dig> of h <dig>  <cit>  to osmoresponsive promoters to induce the gene expression of up-regulated genes. in fact, it seems contradictory that the activation of the genes required the recruitment of a histone deacetylase to finally increase its acetylation, unless the sites deacetylated by rpd <dig> differed from those analyzed in this study. conversely, the observation that saga is recruited to the osmostres up-regulated genes  <cit>  is in agreement with the increased acetylation level of the genes we found. gcn5p is a saga subunit with histone acetyltransferase activity with specificity for h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  hence, gcn5p may be responsible for the increase in acetylation at these lysine residues, but is limited to the tss region. the slight increase in h4k <dig> acetylation observed may be attributed to another histone acetyltransferase activity specific for this lysine, perhaps esa1p.

methylation of histone h <dig> in s. cerevisiae has also been related to transcription, mainly h3k4me <dig> at promoters and h3k36me <dig> in the coding region  <cit> . in our study, we measured the changes of the h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> levels brought about by the repression or induction of genes. figure  <dig> shows the profile of these histone modifications of genes, which were up- or down-regulated with osmotic stress before  and after  stress. before stress, h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> showed a higher modification level in the down-regulated genes than the in the up-regulated ones. with h3k4me <dig>  in which a negative correlation has been reported  <cit> , the reverse effect occurred. yet the most remarkable point of this experiment was the comparison made of the profiles before and after stress. the methylation levels of the analyzed lysine residues did not change drastically, quite unlike what happened in acetylation. thus, the methylation profiles of the up- or down-regulated genes barely changed after 10 min of stress, with only slight increases found in the up-regulated genes and slight decreases in the down-regulated genes noted along the transcribed region in h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig>  it is also worth noting that these changes were not limited to either the tss in h3k4me <dig> or the transcribed region in h3k36me <dig>  but that both changes occurred in the promoter and the wide region of the 5′ transcribed region. h3k79me <dig> displayed a particular behavior because the changes caused by stress, mainly in the repression of the down-regulated genes, were located principally near the tss. it seems that the profiles of both the up- and down-regulated genes tended to generally approach each other after stress. taken together, these results strongly suggest that the tri-methylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> across the transcribed region is a process that most likely stems from the presence or passage of rna pol ii, as described by other authors. to determine whether the reverse process, that is, the de-methylation of these lysine residues during the repression of the down-regulated genes, was slow or fast, we re-focused on rp genes. figure  <dig> shows the profiles of h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> of the rp genes as compared with the remaining genes both before  and after  stress. once again, we observe that all four modifications were very intense before stress . repression of these genes by stress lowered all the modifications but, in this case, not at the level of the remaining genes. furthermore, h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> seemed to be de-methylated more intensely or, perhaps, more rapidly than h3k <dig>  alternatively, it was possible to replace the methylated histones with other non methylated ones in a process mediated by chromatin remodeling complexes.figure  <dig>

while this manuscript was being prepared, a genome-wide mapping of five histone modifications, including h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and h3k14ac, during diamide stress was published  <cit> . our results agree with the genome-wide changes described in this recently published study. however, these authors also found that the h3k4me <dig> levels increased at the 5′ ends of a substantial number of diamide-repressed genes during their repression, including rp genes  <cit> , which clearly contradicts our results. the distinct chromatin changes observed in the rp genes during repression can be explained only if both osmotic and diamide stresses operate via distinct pathways.

the timing of the acetylation and methylation processes, shown herein, suggests some major consequence. thus, several complexes with histone acetyltransferase activity, such as nua <dig>  <cit>  or saga  <cit> , have been described to bind during gene activation to h3k4me <dig> to promote their histone acetyltransferase activity toward h3k <dig>  given our results, it is difficult to accept that the  changes in the levels of h3k4me <dig> produced during the activation of transcription in the up-regulated genes can mediate the downstream effects affecting the acetylation state of h <dig> in a short time when the opposite is much more likely. consistently with our results, the mutation of histone h3k <dig> has been reported to result in a loss of h3k4me <dig> in bulk histones  <cit> , or more recently, that histone h3k <dig> demethylation is negatively regulated by h3k <dig> acetylation in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our mapping data of the modifications occurring under standard growing conditions generally agree with previous studies  <cit> , although we also observed several unexpected behaviors . in fact, it is strikingly that all the genome-wide features of h3k79me <dig> described herein are similar to those of acetylation.

to date, most chromatin state maps have provided static pictures of histone modifications. however, the participation of modifications of histones in regulating gene expression must occur as a dynamic process. in this research, we have conducted a study that has focused on the genome-wide changes of several relevant histone modifications associated with the major transcriptional reprogramming caused by osmotic stress. we report herein that the most striking change is the quick deacetylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig>  associated with the repression of genes. activated genes increase the acetylation levels at these same sites, but the acetylation process of activated genes seems smaller in quantitative terms to that of the deacetylation of repressed genes. the changes noted in the acetylation state of osmoregulated genes are caused mainly in the transcription start site  region. as expected, the tri-methylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  and also the di-methylation of h3k <dig>  of the activated or repressed genes also changed by increasing and decreasing, respectively. however, the short-term changes observed in the post-stress methylation of histones are much more moderate than those of acetylation. this research work, besides that recently reported while preparing this manuscript  <cit> , is the first genome-wide study of dynamic changes in histone modifications in response to global transcriptional reprogramming in yeast. the observed changes support the acetylation hypothesis given the possibility of them acting as signals involved in triggering the process of activating or repressing transcription. the moderate changes noted in the methylation of histones seem to be a process that occurs as a result of presence of rna pol ii. our results also indicate that the acetylation state of histones during transcription activation or repression is a much quicker process than methylation.

here we show that dynamic studies need to be done to gain a better understanding of the relationship between chromatin and transcription. we foresee that an understanding of chromatin will strongly benefit from an even more detailed study into the dynamics of chromatin modifications.
