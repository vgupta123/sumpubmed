BACKGROUND
while lactic acid bacteria are generally non-motile, some of them are flagellated and exhibit motility. lactobacillus agilis and lactobacillus ruminis are representatives of those flagellated microbes which have been primarily isolated from homeothermal animals such as cows, pigs, birds, etc. . so far, a few studies on these lactobacilli have been done, but their characteristics are barely understood. flagella have a complex protein structure and their filaments are made up of a subunit protein referred to as flagellin. flagellins are also known as ligands of toll-like receptor  <dig> , one of pattern recognition receptors  <cit> . in a previous study, neville et al. presented the genetic and transcriptional analysis of the motility-associated genes of l. ruminis. the immunological activity of flagellin isolated from l. ruminis and a few other flagellated lactobacilli via tlr <dig> was also reported, although flagellins of l. agilis were not included  <cit> .

our group has recruited l. agilis as a model of motile lactobacilli which reside in the gastrointestinal mucosa. although l. agilis is frequently isolated from birds, there are other isolates from pigs and humans  <cit> . in addition, we isolated a few l. agilis strains from lemurs and tapirs . hence, l. agilis may be considered as a commensal distributed among various animals. a major advantage in the study of this species is that it is capable of transformation with well-established plasmid vectors such as pgk <dig> and derivatives  <cit>  . thus l agilis can be investigated using genetic manipulations or applied as biotherapeutics, such as vaccine/drug-delivery systems  <cit> . while l. agilis appears to be a promising model, however, it has not been characterized sufficiently.

this study focuses on the flagellins of a highly motile strain, l. agilis bkn <dig>  which was derived from a chicken isolate strain, jcm  <dig>  firstly, the expression profile of the two copies of flagellin-encoding genes was determined. secondly, posttranscriptional modification of the proteins was shown, and the stability of the flagellar filaments under depolymerizing conditions was tested. lastly, the immunological activity of the flagellins was compared to that of the orthologous proteins of pathogenic bacteria in their interaction with caco- <dig> cells. the aim of this study is to reveal previously unknown characteristics of flagellins of the motile commensal l. agilis.

RESULTS
motility of l. agilis strains
the motility of each l. agilis strain was confirmed in mrs soft-agar culture. jcm  <dig> and jcm  <dig> spread in the semi-solid medium while jcm 1187t and l. paracasei igm <dig> did not . the motile strains were then observed by microscopy; however, only a small fraction of the cells were actively swimming. in order to isolate a uniformly motile cell culture, hundreds of subcultures of jcm  <dig> and jcm  <dig> were investigated. with this screening, a highly motile subculture of jcm  <dig>  identified as bkn <dig>  was obtained. in the culture of bkn <dig>  almost all cells were actively moving at exponential phase, with decreasing motility at late exponential phase to stationary phase. tem analysis showed multiple filaments around the bkn <dig> cells, indicating peritrichous flagella of the bacterium.fig.  <dig> observation of motility and flagella. a the motility of l. agilis strains was determined using semi-solid mrs-agar medium. three l. agilis strains and l. paracasei igm <dig>  were stabbed and incubated overnight. b tem image of l. agilis bkn <dig> grown on an mrs-agar plate. the rates of magnification were 13900: <dig>  and 76600: <dig> . arrow heads point flagellar filaments of bkn88



expression of flagellin genes
based on the sequence of l. agilis dsm 20509t, which has recently been deposited to genbank, a partial gene map of the motility operon is shown in fig. 2a. two flagellin-encoding genes with 90 % homology of both their nucleotides and amino acids are located in tandem. to discriminate the transcription of the two homologous flagellin-encoding genes, flic <dig> and flic <dig>  specific primers were designed. since only the amplicon of flic <dig> includes a hindiii site, the specificity of the primers were easily validated by digestion of the pcr products with the restriction enzyme . rt-pcr to detect transcription of flic1/flic <dig> in bkn <dig> was performed at early exponential phase, when the culture showed the highest motility. as shown in fig. 2c, expression of both flic <dig> and flic <dig> were detected.fig.  <dig> genetic analysis of the flagellin-encoding genes of l. agilis bkn <dig>  a partial gene map of the l. agilis motility operon. pcr amplification primers and the hindiii site are shown. filled arrows represent putative glycosyltransferases. b validation of flagellin-specific primers. partial fragments of flic <dig> and flic <dig> were amplified by pcr using the specific primers and digested with hindiii. c transcription of flic1/flic <dig> was detected by rt-pcr. pcr without reverse transcription was also performed to detect contaminated dna



composition and posttranslational modification of the flagellins
flagellar filaments of bkn <dig>  l. monocytogenes egd, and s. typhimurium 92– <dig> were isolated by ultracentrifugation. the isolated proteins were then analyzed by sds-page and cbb staining. as shown in fig. 3a, double bands which have slightly different molecular mass from each other were detected from bkn <dig>  to identify these two proteins, each band was collected separately and analyzed by maldi-tof ms after digestion with trypsin. the mass spectra obtained from the two protein bands appeared to be similar, with minor differences . although the overall coverage of the peptide mass fingerprinting was low, two major peak of both mass spectra were consistent with those of peptides from flic <dig>  and flic <dig> . since there are multiple glycosyltransrerase genes at flanking region of the flagellin genes , glycosylation of the flagellins was predicted. pas-staining of acrylamide gels indicated that both flic <dig> and flic <dig> underwent posttranslational modification . neither the flagellins of s. typhimurium nor those of l. monocytogenes were stained with pas as already known, albeit the flagellin of l. monocytogenes was glycosylated with n-acetylglucosamine  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sds-page and staining. isolated flagellins from l. agilis bkn <dig> , s. typhimurium 92– <dig> , and l. monocytogenes egd  were separated by sds-page and stained with cbb  or pas . the molecular mass of the standard marker bands are shown at the left margin

depolymerization of flagellar filaments
the stability of the flagellar filaments of l. agilis bkn <dig> and s. typhimurium 92– <dig> were assessed by heating, and treatment with acid and detergent. after the purified flagellar filaments were incubated under the each condition, the proteins were applied to native-page gels. since flagellar filaments are macromolecules, only the depolymerized proteins can travel in the gel. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the flagellar filaments of l. agilis bkn <dig> were more resistant to thermal or acidic conditions than those of s. typhimurium 92– <dig>  while the flagella of s. typhimurium were depolymerized even at 37 °c, those of l. agilis were partially disassembled only at 57 °c. monomeric flagellins of l. agilis were detected after treatment with 5 mm hcl; however,  <dig>  mm hcl was sufficient to depolymerize the flagellar filaments of s. typhimurium. differences between the flagella of the two organisms were not observed under sds-treatment.fig.  <dig> stability of flagellar filaments in different conditions. treated or non-treated flagellar filaments of s. typhimurium 92– <dig>  and l. agilis bkn <dig>  were analyzed by native-page. temperatures and concentrations of reagents are shown on the top margin. occurrence of depolymerization was shown on the bottom margin. f: filament state, m: monomeric state



immunological activity of the flagellins
il- <dig> production from caco- <dig> cells induced by stimulation with flagella/flagellins was assessed. with native flagella  of l. agilis bkn <dig>  no clear il- <dig> production was detected, while high levels of il- <dig> was observed by stimulation with those of s. typhimurium 92– <dig> and l. monocytogenes egd . the same assay was performed with depolymerized flagellins prepared by chaotropic denaturation. after this treatments, the il- <dig> response was slightly increased in l. agilis flagellins, but still much lower than that induced by s. typhimurium . the conserved amino acid residues of bacterial flagellins which are critical for tlr5-recognition of l. agilis and other bacteria were compared . most of the amino acid residues were conserved in the lactobacilli; however, there were a few differences between the commensal bacteria and the tlr5-stimulating pathogens. while s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes have -lqr- in the tlr5-recognition site, l. ruminis and l. agilis instead have -lgr- and -lnr- respectively. moreover, two other differences at the site were found in l. agilis flagellins.fig.  <dig> analysis of the immunological properties of isolated flagellins. a filamentous flagellins  were added to caco- <dig> cell cultures and released il- <dig> was quantified by elisa. values are mean + se . statistical significance was also shown . b caco- <dig> cells were stimulated with native  or urea-treated  flagellins at  <dig> pmol/ml. values are mean + se . c alignment of amino acid sequences of major flagellins from pathogenic bacteria and lactobacilli . conserved residues which were reported to be important for tlr <dig> recognition by smith et. al. are highlighted. boxed letters are different from the conserved amino acid residues. underlines represent polymorphic amino acids between flic <dig> and flic2: a and k are k and a in flic <dig>  references:  <cit> 



discussion
motile lactobacilli have rarely been studied, and as commensals, the significance of their flagella remains unknown. with increasing interest in the immunological properties of lactic acid bacteria, the unique ability of the flagella of l. agilis to interact with tlr <dig> is of particular note. in this study, flagellins of l. agilis bkn <dig> were analyzed and some of their unique characteristics have been uncovered.

the flagellar filaments of l. agilis bkn <dig> consist of two homologous proteins, flic <dig> and flic <dig>  this was confirmed at both the mrna and protein level, although the coverage of peptide mass fingerprinting was low, possibly due to glycosylation of the flagellins which affects the mass of peptides. previously, neville et al. reported that a motile strain of l. ruminis atcc  <dig>  which also has two flagellin genes, expressed flic <dig> dominantly and flic <dig> only slightly  <cit> . these facts indicate that flagellin-gene expression and composition of flagellins in the filaments are not uniform among motile lactobacilli.

pas-staining showed that both the flic <dig> and flic <dig> flagellins were glycosylated. this posttranscriptional modification was previously reported in other bacteria and archaea  <cit> . in those studies, glycosylation of flagellins was reported to be involved in stability, assembly, virulence, or motility of flagella or the flagellated microbes, albeit the functions are not fully understood. types of molecular bonds between a flagellin and a glycan are either n- or o-linkage. since only o-linkage bonds are found in gram-positive bacteria, it is likely that lactobacilli have the same type of bond. a previous study showed that glycosylated flagellins of pseudomonas strains were more immunologically active than unmodified flagellins  <cit> . hence, the glycosylation of lactobacillus flagellins might have an impact on their immunological properties. further studies need to be done to investigate mechanisms and influences of the modification.

the flagellar filaments of l. agilis were relatively stable under acidic conditions. this characteristic seems to be reasonable because lactobacilli are routinely producers of lactic acid. the flagellar polymeric structure is found to be thermostable compared to that of salmonella. collectively, the flagella of l. agilis may be durable, which would support sustainable motility of the microbe. resistance to depolymerization also suggests that the flagella are immunologically inactive, since tlr <dig> interacts with only monomeric flagellin but not with polymeric states  <cit> . indeed, the native flagella of l. agilis barely induced il- <dig> production by caco- <dig> cells while those of s. typhimurium elicited the response due to their depolymerization at 37 °c. this might contribute to the symbiotic relationship between l. agilis and its host, by avoiding undesired immunostimulation.

as previously reported, the flagellins of l. ruminis present their immunological activity via interaction with tlr <dig>  <cit> . likewise, monomeric flagellins of l. agilis exhibit the proinflammatory characteristic; however, the activity was found to be much lower than that of s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes in this study. previously, specific amino acid residues conserved among the d <dig> domain of salmonella flic were proven to be critical for tlr5-recognition  <cit> . the independent study by verma et al. also demonstrated that replacement of amino acids at this conserved site of the pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin drastically reduced il- <dig> response via tlr <dig>  <cit> . h. pylori and c. jejuni replaced most of those amino acid residues in their flagellins and thus lack tlr5-stimulating activity. furthermore, a chimeric salmonella flic in which the tlr5-recognition site was replaced with the corresponding site of flagellin from h. pylori failed to interact with tlr <dig>  which supports the importance of those amino acid residues  <cit> . in lactobacillus flagellins, a few mismatchs in those sequences conserved among high tlr5-activators such as the flagellins of s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes were found. hence, it is likely that the attenuated immunological activity of l. agilis flagellins are attributed to the slight but influential differences at the tlr5-recognition site. as a symbiotic bacterium, l. agilis may not be involved in proinflammatory responses at the gastrointestinal mucosa. presumably, the attenuation on the tlr <dig> ligand could help the bacterium to avoid exclusion by the local immune system of the hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
the flagella filaments of l. agilis bkn <dig> consist of two homologous glycosylated flagellins and are relatively stable in acidic and thermal conditions. the flagellins likely have an incomplete tlr5-recognition site, which may be the reason for their attenuated immunological activity. these characteristics of the flagellin are presumably a consequence of adaptation as a commensal microbe.
