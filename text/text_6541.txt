BACKGROUND
sex-ratio  distorters are genes that cause an unequal representation of the sex chromosomes among the offspring through differences in number, quality or function of x- and y-bearing spermatozoa. these sr distorters are typically located on one of the sex chromosomes. they act during spermatogenesis by distorting the meiosis in their own favour  or by impairing the function or increasing the mortality of the opposite-sex gametes, which gives the sr distorters a selective advantage  <cit> . because of this selective advantage, newly mutated sr distorters can quickly invade a population. in principal, sr distorters may exert their effect not only during spermatogenesis but also post-copulation in the female genital tract, by influencing sperm transport, sperm survival or fertilization capability. sr distorters are assumed to be selfish and non-adaptive for their carriers  <cit> .

sr distorters exert strong selection pressure for suppressors of the distortion, which are genes occurring on the opposite sex chromosome or on one of the autosomal chromosomes, that neutralize the action of the distorter and often lead to a genetic arms race between the two types of sr genes  <cit> . a stable gene polymorphism is possible when sr-distorter carriers have a lower fitness, thereby preventing the driving distorter alleles from going to fixation  <cit> .  most examples of sr distorters are found in drosophila spp.  <cit> . their discovery required sophisticated crossing schemes, often between individuals from different populations or incipient species  <cit> . although sex chromosomes with sr distorting elements are known in drosophila spp. since  <dig>  the identity of causal genes remained unknown until the late 1990s because the sr distorting elements are usually associated with complex chromosome inversions, impeding their genetic mapping  <cit> . nevertheless, sr distorters are thought to be relatively common, even in mammals, but are rarely observed, probably because of rapid gene fixation and sr suppressors that mask their activities  <cit> . 

stable presence of multiple alleles  or haplotypes  on the haploid y-chromosome in the absence of population subdivision or metapopulation structure only seems possible with negative frequency-dependent selection, since otherwise the fittest allele or haplotype would inevitably sweep to fixation  <cit> . sr distorters generally reduce the fitness of their bearer by a reduction of the sperm count making negative frequency-dependent selection possible through associations between mating rate and polygamy on one hand and sperm depletion and sperm competition on the other  <cit> . in this scenario increased sr distorter frequencies result in an increasingly biased population sex ratio and in a decrease of the average semen quality, which can cause an increase in the female or male mating rate. an increased mating rate benefits wild-type alleles at the expense of sr distorters as their carriers perform better in sperm competition  and show less decrease in fertility after repeated matings due to sperm depletion . also sr suppressors are hypothesised to have a fitness cost considering that they are polymorphic in drosophila spp.  <cit> . a fitness cost is necessary to prevent gene fixation in view of their selective advantage against wild-type alleles.  alternatively, stable gene polymorphism at the y chromosome may result from interactions in the population dynamics of sr distorters and sr suppressors as indicated in simulation studies, albeit in a small fraction of parameter space  <cit> .

the african buffalo  population of the kruger national park  consists of some  <dig>  individuals  <cit> . the population was completely fenced from neighbouring populations in zimbabwe and mozambique between  <dig> and  <dig>  the knp buffalo are polygamous and live in both small bachelor herds and mixed-sex herds of a few dozen to over  <dig>  individuals  <cit> . reproduction is strongly related to the availability and seasonality of resources with around 75% of all births occurring late in the wet season, from january to march  <cit> . the foetal sex ratio for the population as a whole does not differ significantly from equality across decades  =  <dig> , 95% ci =  <dig> - <dig> , n = 2626) in agreement with "fisher's principle", which predicts the evolution of an equal birth sex ratio, assuming equal cost of daughters and sons  <cit> .

high y-chromosomal microsatellite polymorphism, characterized by rainfall-correlated haplotype-frequency shifts between year cohorts, has been observed not only in the knp population but also in the hluhluwe-imfolozi park  population located some  <dig> km farther south   <cit> . the gene diversity in the knp population is similar to that recently observed in eurasian cattle , although the estimate for cattle is positively biased due to a larger number of microsatellites   <cit> . when looking at the individual microsatellites, gene diversity and allelic diversity are higher in the single african buffalo population of knp than in all eurasian cattle breeds combined .

the observation of high genetic diversity despite yearly haplotype frequency fluctuations was surprising as the latter is expected to quickly result in gene fixation  <cit> . the presence of multiple haplotypes cannot be attributed to population subdivision. there is no significant genetic differentiation between gonarezhou np , northern knp and southern knp indicating extensive  gene flow   <cit> . this is supported by radio-tracking data of over  <dig> individual knp buffalo that show all sex and age groups move between mixed-sex herds, with monthly emigration rates of 9-26% for adult males and 2% for females and subadults  <cit> . the high haplotype diversity also cannot be explained by recent mutations as three of the five major haplotypes in knp  differ by at least seven mutational events . the presence of multiple haplotypes therefore indicates some kind of balancing selection. balancing selection is expected to result in an increased gene diversity relative to haplotype  diversity because of a relatively even haplotype  frequency distribution. this is supported by the observation that y-chromosomal gene diversity is higher in african buffalo than in eurasian cattle when comparing microsatellites with a similar number of alleles .

we hypothesise that the frequency shifts in y-chromosomal haplotypes between year cohorts in the african buffalo population of knp are indicative of sr genes. accordingly, we expected to find temporal correlations between y-chromosomal haplotype frequencies and sex ratios of foetuses and calves .

RESULTS
a temporal genetic analysis of genetic differentiation in calves using y-chromosomal microsatellite data demonstrated highly significant  differences between male calves conceived during a dry season  and those conceived during a wet season . this was mainly due to an opposite  correlation between haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> . haplotype  <dig> was observed only among males conceived during the observed dry seasons, whilst haplotype  <dig> was observed only among males conceived during the observed wet seasons. a negative  or positive  correlation of this magnitude by chance for these two haplotypes, either between seasons  or years , is highly unlikely .

if haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are linked to sr distorters or sr suppressors then one would expect an alternating seasonal pattern with sex ratios  as well, which was indeed observed . in the same age cohorts as were used in the genetic analyses the sex ratio was higher among individuals conceived during the wet seasons than among those conceived during the dry seasons . there was an identical pattern in earlier age cohorts. among 0- <dig> months old calves culled between june  <dig> and february  <dig>  the sex ratio was only  <dig>   among those conceived in the dry season of  <dig>  but as high as  <dig>   among those conceived in the subsequent wet season    <cit> . most importantly, a significant seasonal difference in sex ratio, with an effect size of  <dig>  , was observed among the foetuses collected between  <dig> and  <dig> . the sex ratio was female-biased during the dry season  and male-biased during the wet season . the largest difference was observed at the change of seasons between march and april. the seasonal difference in sex ratio was already present among foetuses ≤  <dig> months old , ruling out late-term foetal loss as an explanation.

it was previously noted that the frequency of haplotype  <dig> per year cohort is correlated with the mean annual rainfall in the three years before birth, showing high frequencies after dry years   <cit> . additional analyses show that the same is true for haplotype  <dig>  showing high frequencies after wet years . thus haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> show an opposite correlation not only across seasons, but also across years . again, this pattern is associated with sex-ratio variation. there was a positive correlation between the annual foetal sex ratio  and the mean annual rainfall in the previous two or three years, including or excluding part of the wet season of the focal year . with a rainfall period of three years including the complete wet season of the focal year , the effect size of the sex ratio variation between dry and wet periods was  <dig>  , which is similar to that between seasons . the foetal sex ratio was significantly female-biased in  <dig>  but significantly male-biased in  <dig> . the average foetal sex ratio across years did not deviate from equality  as has also been observed in an earlier study  <cit> .

the frequency of haplotype  <dig> was ≤  <dig>   among males conceived during the wet seasons of  <dig> and  <dig>  but it was ≥  <dig>   among those conceived between  <dig> and  <dig> following the severe drought of  <dig> . this constitutes a difference of at least a factor of five in half a generation .

the conception peak occurred between february and april, corresponding to  <dig> %  of all conceptions. it differs by one month compared to the birth peak as the gestation period is around  <dig> months. no more than  <dig> %  of the conceptions occurred during the dry season . there was a negative correlation between the annual pregnancy rate among ≥ 2-year old females  and the annual rainfall . the mean pregnancy rate was  <dig> % , with the yearly rate varying between 19%  and 68% . the mean adult pregnancy rate  was as high as  <dig> % .

discussion
a plausible explanation for the associations between y-chromosomal haplotype frequencies and foetal sex ratio is that haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are linked to sr genes. haplotype  <dig> would be linked to a y-chromosomal sr distorter, resulting in high population sex ratios during wet periods, and haplotype  <dig> to a y-chromosomal sr suppressor, causing this haplotype to increase its frequency during dry periods when population sex ratios are low . the low sex ratios cannot be explained by mere inactivation of the sr distorter considering that they were significantly female-biased in  <dig> and during the dry seasons. the sr-suppressor carrying males produce equal numbers of sons and daughters during dry periods , considering the high frequency of haplotype  <dig> while the sex ratio is low, but very few offspring during wet periods , as the then high sex ratio precludes a low frequency due to female-biased conception. on the other hand, sr-distorter carrying males produce substantially more sons than daughters during wet periods considering the then high frequency of haplotype  <dig>  in turn, we argue that they produce very few offspring during dry periods considering the low frequency of haplotype  <dig> at those times. although the frequency of haplotype  <dig> is low , it is high enough to explain sex ratios as high as  <dig> - <dig>  during wet periods, assuming a frequency of  <dig> - <dig>  among fathers and 95% male progeny .

1: suppressing a hypothesised x-chromosomal sr distorter

2: ♀-biased due to a hypothesised x-chromosomal sr distorter

↑: increasing haplotype frequency

↓: decreasing haplotype frequency

↔: stable haplotype frequency

in the scenario described above, the fitness cost of temporarily reduced fertility prevents the sr distorter and sr suppressor from going to fixation. our failure to observe haplotype  <dig> and  <dig> in dry and wet season cohorts, respectively, may even indicate a temporal reduction in fertility that nears sterility. a strong temporal reduction in fertility co-occurring with sr distortion is not implausible considering that reductions of more than 50% and even sterility have been observed with sr distorters in drosophila spp., with the latter being caused by a single gene  <cit> .

female-biased sex ratios and the presence of a y-chromosomal sr suppressor during dry periods indicate that an x-chromosomal sr distorter may also be present in knp buffalo . the two sr distorters and the sr suppressor may have a common origin, as it has recently been shown that a sr suppressor  in drosophila simulans has originated as a retro-transposed duplication of a sr distorter   <cit> . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the female-biased sex ratios are not due to an x-chromosomal sr distorter but instead are the result of an inherent property of y-bearing spermatozoa making them relatively vulnerable to stress and aging  <cit> . the y-chromosomal sr suppressor in such a case would act by making the x-bearing spermatozoa equally vulnerable to stress and aging.

the sr distorter and sr suppressor are likely to exert their effect during spermatogenesis, which is supported by two observations. firstly, many y-chromosomal genes are known to be involved in spermatogenesis  <cit> . they may act by influencing the transcription of various genes through epigenetic and epistatic mechanisms  <cit> . it is also possible that the sr distorter and sr suppressor exert their main effect post-copulation in the female genital tract by influencing sperm transport, sperm survival or fertilization capability. secondly, in our study population it was shown that ejaculate volume, sperm motility and proportion of morphologically normal spermatozoa decrease significantly during the dry season   <cit> . studies on cattle , red deer , guinea pig , mice  and humans have shown correlations between semen quality parameters on one hand and spermatozoal sex ratio, foetal sex ratio, offspring sex ratio and sex-differential fertilizing capability of spermatozoa on the other  <cit> .

in the aforementioned mammals a low semen quality is associated with a low sex ratio, which also is the case for the african buffalo . these observations may point towards a general mechanism in mammals whereby semen-quality related sex-ratio variation is driven by sr genes . a possible explanation is that a positive association evolves more readily as males with high-quality semen may benefit from producing sons, who can inherit their father's semen quality, while males with low-quality semen benefit from producing daughters  <cit> . this would increase the transmission rate of newly mutated sr genes, which can be important for their invasion success as stochastic events increase the risk of establishment failure  <cit> .

in african buffalo the association between sr genes and semen quality may have set in motion the co-evolution of y-chromosomal and x-chromosomal sr distorters and their suppressors whose temporal variation of activity  is indirectly triggered by the amount of rainfall. here we have shown that y-chromosomal haplotype frequencies, foetal sex ratios and pregnancy rates  are all associated with rainfall. the decrease in semen quality in the african buffalo during the dry season is likely due to decreasing availability and quality of food resources, which are directly related to the amount of rainfall  <cit> . rainfall is one of the most critical environmental factors affecting resource availability in savannah ecosystems  <cit> . in other african bovids sperm production is reduced by 30-90% during the non-breeding season  <cit> .

the characteristics of the sr genes in african buffalo are different from those described in other species to date. the sr distorter and sr suppressor occur on a single sex chromosome and show a temporal and opposite variation in gene activity. furthermore, there are indications that both an x-chromosomal and y-chromosomal sr distorter are present in the population. another unique feature is that female buffaloes in knp are also able to influence the foetal sex in relation to body condition . the effect is opposite to that of males, with females in above average body condition  investing in daughters and those in below average body condition investing in sons  <cit> .

constant fitness models show that the co-occurrence of an x- and y-chromosomal sr distorter can result in a stable gene polymorphism at the y chromosome  <cit> . although this only seems possible in 2% of the parameter space, extra stability may be provided by additional factors not included in the models. such factors may be presence of a y-chromosomal suppressor, opposite effects of the two parents on foetal sex ratio and frequency-dependent selection through an association between mating rate and sperm quality . furthermore, the constant fitness models show cycling of allele  frequencies, which in our study population is observed in relation to rainfall.

we consider it unlikely that the postulated y-chromosomal sr-correlated genes are associated with male mating success or semen quality  as such since these cannot explain sex-ratio variation. that the postulated genes exert their main effect post-conception by influencing pregnancy loss  seems equally unlikely. to prevent gene fixation, pregnancy losses with wild-type haplotypes should be similar to those with haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  which would have to be considerable  to explain the large haplotype frequency variations . moreover, additional losses of female embryos and foetuses must be assumed to explain the male-biased sex ratios. however, high pregnancy losses are difficult to reconcile with adult pregnancy rates of 70%. furthermore, this scenario would imply that haplotype  <dig> is associated with below average pregnancy loss during dry periods while the opposite is true for the remaining haplotypes, as indicated by the then low pregnancy rates and conception numbers for the population as a whole. it is difficult to envisage a physiological mechanism capable of making haplotype  <dig> so successful under stressful conditions , yet so unsuccessful under beneficial conditions . cryptic female choice at least seems unlikely since this would imply a positive adaptive value of choosing male offspring on the basis of just a single y-chromosomal haplotype, unlinked to the autosomal genome. furthermore, haplotype-specific pregnancy loss is difficult to relate to frequency-dependent selection. this would require that the physiological mechanism by which the haplotypes are associated with pregnancy loss in individual females is modulated, directly or indirectly, by their frequency in the population at large. a final alternative explanation would be a co-occurrence of two independent mechanisms: rainfall-dependent and haplotype-specific mating or fertilization success in the fathers on one hand and rainfall-dependent and sex-specific pregnancy loss in the mothers on the other. again, this scenario is difficult to relate to frequency-dependent selection while it also requires a mechanism that causes haplotype  <dig> to be most successful under stressful conditions but least successful under beneficial conditions.

although we consider the alternative explanations for the correlations between y-chromosomal haplotype frequencies and foetal sex ratio unlikely, and propose the presence of sr genes as the most plausible explanation, this will need direct confirmation in a future studies. this may be done by analyzing associations between semen quality and spermatozoal sex ratio in individual bulls with known y-chromosomal genotype.

CONCLUSIONS
polymorphic active sr genes in natural populations of mammals have rarely been observed but may be more common than previously thought. we suggest that in many mammals semen-quality related primary sex-ratio variation is influenced by sr genes. stable gene polymorphism may be maintained with relative ease when sr genes fulfil one or more of the specific characteristics observed in african buffalo.
