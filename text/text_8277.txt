BACKGROUND
glutathione is an important antioxidant and redox buffer in eukaryotes and most prokaryotes that fulfills many roles in plant metabolism and plant defense during abiotic and biotic stress conditions in the sporophyte  <cit> , but its role remains largely unknown for the gametophyte. in the sporophyte, glutathione is involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species , redox signaling, the modulation of gene expression and in the regulation of enzymatic activities . glutathione is also involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, herbicides  <cit>  heavy metals such as cadmium  <cit> , and protects proteins from oxidation by a process called glutathionylation  <cit> . the importance of glutathione for plant growth and development is highlighted by the observation that impaired glutathione synthesis correlates with growth defects  <cit> , and that the complete absence of glutathione synthesis results in a lethal phenotype  <cit> . additionally, the redox state of glutathione is also important for plant growth and development. in non-stressed plants it occurs mainly in its reduced form , whereas during oxidative stress high amounts of oxidized glutathione  can be formed. the occurrence of high amounts of gssg correlates with reduced growth, dormancy, or cell death  <cit> .

glutathione synthesis takes place in two atp-dependent steps triggered by enzymes that are encoded by single genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . in the first step cysteine is linked with glutamate to form γ-glutamylcysteine. this reaction is triggered by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase . in the second step, glycine is linked to γ-glutamylcysteine by glutathione synthetase  to form the final product glutathione. in arabidopsis, these two steps seem to take place exclusively in plastids and the cytosol, which are therefore considered as the main centers of glutathione synthesis  <cit> . in the sporophyte, transcripts of gsh <dig> and gsh <dig> and the final product, glutathione, can be found in all major plant parts and in all cell organelles at different concentrations   <cit> . according to immunohistochemistry and quantitative transmission electron microscopy, the highest levels of glutathione have been detected in mitochondria and the lowest in plastids. vacuoles contained glutathione only under certain conditions   <cit> , whereas glutathione could not be detected in cell walls  <cit> . although the role and subcellular distribution of glutathione in the sporophyte are well defined, the necessity and role of glutathione in the gametophyte remain largely unexamined. bioinformatic data cast doubt on the importance of glutathione metabolism in the male gametophyte, as both gsh <dig> and gsh <dig> are transcribed at negligible levels in pollen and sperm cells   <cit> . nevertheless, due to the apparent sensitivity of microspores to mitochondrial damage induced by chronic oxidative stress  <cit> , we decided to investigate the necessity and localization of glutathione in the gametophyte in order to reveal strategies for pollen to cope with ros during tube germination and elongation.

in the current study, we investigate whether glutathione is essential for pollen germination, and if so, whether such pools of glutathione depend on new synthesis or an existing glutathione pool available in the pollen grains before the start of germination. the subcellular distribution of glutathione will also reveal if glutathione is distributed equally or shows compartment-specific adaptations as found in leaf and root cells  <cit> .

in order to achieve this goal we studied pollen germination rates and the subcellular distribution of glutathione in pollen grains of wildtype plants treated with and without buthionine sulfoximine . bso is known to inhibit the first enzyme of the glutathione synthesis pathway thus leading to a strong decrease in glutathione levels  <cit> . additionally, we studied pollen germination rates and the subcellular distribution of glutathione in the pollen grains of the pad2- <dig> mutant, which has a mutation of the first enzyme of the glutathione synthetic pathway thus reducing the content of glutathione by 80% compared to the wildtype  <cit> . differences in glutathione contents between the wildtype and the pad2- <dig> mutant should give detailed insight into the roles of temporary and permanent glutathione depletion on pollen germination in vitro.

RESULTS
pollen germination
wildtype pollen grains showed a germination rate of 71% when grown on germination medium without gsh and bso . treatment of  <dig>  mm bso, which depletes glutathione, decreased pollen germination rate to about 5%. to examine whether glutathione depletion may be linked with decreased levels of auxin, which is one of the most important plant hormones for pollen tube growth  <cit> , we have applied  <dig>  μm indole-3-acetic acid  together with bso in the growth media. the addition of iaa to growth media containing bso restored pollen germination rate to levels similar to the control . similar levels were reached  when pollen germination was performed on pollen germination media containing only iaa . the addition of  <dig> mm gsh to the media containing  <dig>  mm bso restored pollen germination rate to 60%. a similar rate  was found when wildtype pollen grains  were allowed to germinate on media containing  <dig> mm gsh. pollen germination rate was reduced to 12% when higher concentrations of gsh  were added to the growth medium . a similar germination rate  was observed after pollen grains were transferred onto pollen germination media containing  <dig>  mm bso and either  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm gsh . the addition of iaa to the pollen media containing  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm gsh did not significantly change pollen germination . higher bso concentrations  had similar inhibitory effects on pollen germination rate as observed using media containing  <dig>  mm bso . nevertheless, the addition of  <dig> mm gsh only partially restored pollen germination rate  when added to  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm bso, respectively. the addition of  <dig> mm gsh to pollen germination media containing  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm led to pollen germination at rates of 14% and 5%, respectively .

pollen germination of the pad2- <dig> mutant was around 16% on medium without gsh and bso . similar levels were reached  when pollen germination was performed on pollen germination media containing iaa . treatment of  <dig>  mm bso decreased pollen germination rate to 6%. the addition of auxin to growth media containing bso restored pollen germination rates to levels similar to the control . adding  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm gsh to the medium containing  <dig>  mm bso increased pollen germination rate to 16% and 25%, respectively . similar levels were found when  <dig> mm gsh and  <dig> mm gsh were added to pollen germination media without bso . the addition of  <dig> mm gsh to medium containing  <dig>  mm bso decreased pollen germination rates to 5%, which was similar to the germination rate of pollen grown on medium with the addition of  <dig> mm gsh . the addition of iaa to the growth medium containing  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm gsh did not affect pollen germination and was similar to the germination rate of pollen grown on  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm gsh alone . the addition of higher bso concentrations  decreased pollen germination rates to 6% and 4%, respectively . the addition of  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm gsh to media containing  <dig>  mm bso restored pollen germination rates to 23% and 10%, respectively. adding  <dig> mm gsh and  <dig> mm gsh to media containing  <dig> mm bso increased the pollen germination rates of the pad2- <dig> mutant to 11% and 6%, respectively .

glutathione labeling
immunogold particles localized to glutathione were found in all cell compartments except cell walls and vacuoles . gold particle density was much higher in pollen obtained from wildtype plants than in pad2- <dig> mutants . mitochondria, plastids, nuclei and the cytosol contained equally dense quantities of gold particles bound to glutathione . gold particle density was similar in wildtype pollen grains which were allowed to germinate on medium without gsh and bso  and on media containing  <dig> mm gsh with and without  <dig>  mm bso . an increase in glutathione contents in wildtype pollen between 161% and 153% was observed when  <dig> mm gsh was added to the media with or without  <dig>  mm bso, respectively . the treatment of pollen grains from col- <dig> and the pad2- <dig> mutant with bso decreased gold particle density to background levels .

pollen grains from the pad2- <dig> mutant contained lower glutathione-labeling density  than wildtype , whereas the addition of  <dig> mm gsh and  <dig> mm gsh to the germination media increased glutathione contents to values similar to pollen grains from wildtype plants . similar gold particle densities were reached when  <dig>  mm bso was added to gsh .

discussion
the results of this study clearly demonstrate that glutathione synthesis is essential for pollen germination in vitro. despite negligible levels of gsh <dig> and gsh <dig> transcripts occurring in pollen and sperm cells  <cit> , glutathione was found to be clearly present and active in the male gametophyte. pollen germination rates of wildtype pollen, used as controls in the current study , were similar to those observed in previous studies under similar conditions  <cit> . inhibition of glutathione synthesis by bso decreased the pollen germination rate to about 5%, which could be correlated with the absence of glutathione specific labeling in our immunogold assays. bso inhibits the first enzyme  of the glutathione synthesis pathway, which leads to a decrease or complete absence of glutathione in leaves  <cit> . in pollen grains of the pad2- <dig> mutant, in which glutathione synthesis is distorted by a single point mutation in gsh <dig>  decreasing glutathione content to ~20% of wildtype  <cit>  a similar result is observed. pollen germination of the pad2- <dig> mutant was reduced to about 16%, and correlated with an 80% reduction in glutathione specific immunolabeling when compared to the wildtype. a further decrease of pollen germination rate to 5% was accomplished by the addition of bso to the growth media. similar results have also been observed during germ tube development in candida albicans. similarly, strong depletions in gsh contents induced by 1-chloro- <dig>  dinitrobenzene were correlated with very significant reductions in germ tube formation capacity and severe cell mortality  <cit> . the addition of  <dig> mm gsh to growth media containing bso, could restore pollen germination rate and glutathione specific labeling to values similar to the controls in pollen from both wildtype plants and the pad2- <dig> mutant. thus, these results clearly demonstrate that glutathione synthesis and the availability are essential for pollen germination and demonstrate the importance of glutathione not only for plant development but also for pollen germination and tube growth. additionally, these results showed that pollen grains where glutathione synthesis was inhibited by bso were able to import glutathione from the growth medium by unknown mechanisms. this could be important considering that glutathione uptake transporters have not been identified yet at the plasma membrane and that negligible transcripts levels of gsh <dig> and gsh <dig> were found in pollen and sperm cells  <cit> .

the pad2- <dig> gsh <dig> point mutant showed a much lower pollen germination rate , which presumably correlates with a much lower glutathione content  when compared to the wildtype. as the pad2- <dig> mutant accumulates only about 20% glutathione levels of the wildtype  <cit> , these results demonstrate that glutathione contents in pollen grains strongly depend on adequate glutathione availability in the plant. compartment-specific differences , as observed in leaves and roots of the pad2- <dig> mutants  <cit> , could not be detected in pollen grains where glutathione concentrations were found to be distributed in all typically labelled cell compartments equally. a slightly higher germination rate of pad2- <dig> pollen  could be accomplished by the addition of  <dig> mm gsh to the growth media, which still displayed far below the normal germination rate of wildtype control pollen grains  and was similar to the germination rate achieved when pollen grains from the wildtype were treated with the same gsh concentration . the addition of  <dig> mm gsh decreased pollen germination rate in both wildtype and pad2- <dig> mutants to 12% and 6%, respectively, demonstrating that high levels of gsh negatively affect the ability of pollen grains to germinate. it has been demonstrated recently that the treatment of roots with high levels of gsh can cause severe ultrastructural alterations  <cit> . additionally, it has been demonstrated that in gsh-overexpressing tobacco plants, elevated glutathione biosynthetic capacity in the chloroplasts paradoxically increased oxidative stress, leading to severe ultrastructural alterations within chloroplasts and to their ultimate degeneration, eventuating in the death of the cell  <cit> . even though such ultrastructural changes have not been observed during the present study, treatment of pollen grains with high levels of gsh  could potentially inhibit pollen germination . the application of bso together with iaa, one of the most important hormones regulating pollen tube growth  <cit>  restored the rate of pollen germination in the pad2- <dig> mutant to about 14%, which was similar to levels achieved by untreated pollen of the pad2- <dig> mutant used as control. the same experiment restored the rate of pollen germination in the wildtype of bso-treated pollen to over 60%. thus, these results demonstrate that low glutathione levels in pollen grains of the pad2- <dig> mutant must have altered their ability to germinate in the long term. it has been demonstrated recently that the accumulation of ros in mitochondria was found to be critical for proper pollen development, as sterile pollen grains showed decreased pools of atp and nadh and lower activity of mitochondria dna  <cit> . as glutathione is essential for the detoxification of ros/h2o <dig> in plants it seems likely that the low germination rates of pollen grains from the pad2- <dig> mutants were caused by low glutathione levels in the plant and pollen grains during pollen development in the stamen. nevertheless, pollen grains are thought to possess resistance against or ability to downregulate production of stigma-associated ros/h2o <dig>  in order to germinate on and penetrate through the stigma  <cit> . as pollen germination of pad2- <dig> pollen grains could be only partly increased by the addition of  <dig> and  <dig> mm gsh  but never reached rates of the wildtype  these results also suggest that insufficient glutathione is present without activity of gsh <dig> to permit normal rates of germination. thus, we can conclude that sufficient glutathione contents are required during pollen development and also during pollen germination for proper pollen germination of pollen from the pad2- <dig> mutant.

since a reduction of root growth induced by the depletion of gsh is caused by the inhibition of auxin transport  <cit> , we tested if inhibited pollen germination by bso can be restored by treatment with iaa, which is one of the most important plant hormones for pollen tube growth  <cit> . results of this study demonstrated that the application of bso together with iaa diminished the deleterious effects of bso and led to pollen germination rates similar to that of control pollen. the addition of iaa alone or together with gsh did not have such affects. thus, we can conclude that glutathione depletion in pollen grains triggered disturbances in auxin metabolism which are linked with inhibition of pollen germination induced by bso treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
summing up, it can be concluded that glutathione synthesis is essential for pollen germination in vitro. additionally, it was demonstrated that low glutathione levels in the pad2- <dig> mutant decreased their ability to germinate caused by disturbances most probably during pollen development. the mechanisms behind the reduction of pollen germination induced by glutathione depletion could be correlated with disturbances in auxin metabolism which still have to be explored in more detail.
