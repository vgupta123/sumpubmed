BACKGROUND
ribosomal rna genes  encode the rna scaffold of the ribosome and thereby perform what likely is the most basic of all housekeeping functions. within the rdna cluster, each repeat contains one copy of the 18s,  <dig> s and 28s rrna genes, which are separated by several spacers: two internal transcribed spacers, its <dig>  and its <dig> , an external transcribed spacer , and an untranscribed intergenic spacer , separating each adjacent rdna unit. the rdna unit is transcribed by the rna polymerase i  as a single 45s precursor molecule, which is subsequently processed by an ordered cleavage of the spacers. the rdna units are organized in large tandem arrays , generally located within one or a few chromosome pairs, where they constitute the nucleolar organizer regions . during active synthesis, rdna loci are associated to the nucleolus .

while the core domain of the rdna coding region is well conserved, the igs is rapidly evolving, so that it has been used as a marker for identification of closely related species and for quantification of gene flow between populations . in eukaryotes, tandemly repeated multigene families, like rdna, undergo a peculiar pattern of evolution known as "concerted evolution"  <cit> : as a consequence of this, the repeats show a higher sequence homogeneity within a species  than between species . this pattern is achieved through two independent mechanisms known as homogenization  and fixation . homogenization is achieved through several genomic turnover mechanisms, such as unequal crossing-over and gene conversion, while fixation is a by-product of the chromosome reshuffling due to sexual reproduction  <cit> .

despite the presence of molecular mechanisms that homogenize the ribosomal arrays, variations in rdna have been commonly observed both within and among populations of several species. this variation is both quantitative and qualitative, the former consisting in a redundancy of rdna copies and in the number of loci per genome, the latter being typically due to the occurrence of regulatory sub-repeats within the rdna cluster  <cit> . actually, the igs contains the rna-poli promoter and other important regulatory elements, such as terminators, spacer promoters and enhancers. as a consequence, the igs region may show a marked variation in length, due to the redundancy of those functional elements   <cit> . moreover, a higher number of duplicated regulatory elements has been related to an increased rate of rdna transcription, which seems to play an adaptive role .

while the overall structural organization of the rna-poli machinery is comparable in all eukaryotes, the regulatory repeats are quite variable within each species, and hardly comparable between species, so that the region associated with the rdna transcription promoter is generally species-specific  . consequently, igs and rna-poli transcription factors seem to co-evolve in a species-specific way; therefore, this appears as a good candidate system for analyses on evolutionary co-adaptation of gene complexes  <cit> . as a matter of fact, selection must be taken into account to understand rdna dynamics, so that, on the whole, the evolution of rdna clusters is likely under a balanced influence of selection and "concerted evolution". in more detail, selection likely acts differently, the coding regions being more likely under purifying selection, whereas the igs may experience more relaxed selective pressure  <cit> .

then, the repeated organization of rdna would allow the spreading of new variations trough the mechanisms of genomic turnover, as well as the sexual reproduction could allow to fix them in the reproductive units . in this scenario, any mutation in the controlling region, which would produce a better interaction to an essential transcription factor, should be selected for and fixed by unequal crossing over and gene conversion events during gametogenesis, as well as in somatic cells trough mitotic recombination  <cit> . as a consequence of those mechanisms, the rdna clusters, as well as their dedicated transcription machinery, would experience rapid evolutionary changes, which could lead to a rapid evolution of post-mating isolation mechanisms. all that considered, the rdna cluster represents a good candidate for studies on speciation. with this in mind, we started a characterization of the rdna cluster of the mediterranean genus bacillus, which comprises two bisexual species , three unisexual parthenogenetic species , and two hybridogenetic strains . on the whole, bacillus taxa constitute a clear case of reticulate evolution  and provide a good experimental system to analyze the multifaceted relationships among sexual and metasexual taxa  <cit> .

this paper deals with the description of the igs-ets in b. atticus and b. grandii, two closely related species, as evidenced by mitochondrial and satellite dna analyses . b. grandii – a strict bisexual taxon – shows a relic disjunct distribution in sicily, and is divided into three subspecies, b. grandii grandii, b. grandii benazzi and b. grandii maretimi. unlike b. grandii, b. atticus – at present an all-female obligate parthenogen – shows a much wider distribution in the western mediterranean basin, and forms a complex of three different karyological  and allozymic races, without morphological diversification. based on this, b. atticus has been divided into three subspecies, namely b. atticus atticus, b. atticus carius and b. atticus cyprius  <cit> .

the characterization of bacillus igs-ets, the first known for a phasmid insect, allowed us to infer about the variability and evolution of this peculiar tandemly-repeated system, and to compare it to the additional igs-etss known to date in arthropods. moreover, patterns of evolution of rdna repeated sequences in bacillus could be easily comparable to what has been observed for bacillus pericentromeric satellite dna. actually, the bacillus system represents an intriguing model to investigate how "concerted evolution" works on repeated sequences, because the existence of either apomictic and automictic parthenogens provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of meiosis and sex in multigene family evolution  <cit> . in more detail, the automictic parthenogen b. atticus, although maintaining meiosis and crossing over, lacks chromosome reshuffling due to sexual reproduction: for this reason, and according to the "concerted evolution" rationale, new variants can easily spread within a single b. atticus female and her progeny , but cannot spread in the whole taxonomic unit. on the other hand, the bisexual b. grandii, being the closest relative of b. atticus, represents the perfect counterpart, since in this species the repeated sequences would follow the "concerted evolution".

methods
igs characterization
specimens of bacillus atticus, b. grandii grandii, b. g. benazzi and b. g. maretimi were collected at several mediterranean locations. taxa, localities and sample acronyms are reported in table  <dig> 

species, localities, sample acronyms and genbank a.n. of the analyzed specimens.

♀ ♀ = all female parthenogen; ♀ ♂ = bisexual;

* = clone obtained by sequencing the portion of psti <dig> from the last bag <dig> repeat to the 5'-end of the 18s gene.

field-collected specimens were stored at -80°c. total genomic dna was isolated from somatic tissues with a standard phenol-chloroform protocol.

since we didn't have any specific pcr primer to amplify the whole rdna cluster, we decided to proceed with a wide restriction enzyme screening using the following enzymes: taq, alu, sma, ava, hpai, hpaii, clai, ssti, stui, cfoi, hhai, mspi, drai, hincii, xbai and psti. such exploratory restriction analysis was performed on specimens of b. atticus from castel di tusa , neraida  and israel. xbai produced a ladder-like pattern , while psti produced two main fragments, a small one of  <dig> bp and a high molecular weight one of  <dig>  kb . the ladder-like pattern of the xbai fragments evidenced that this sequence is tandemly repeated. total genomic dna from b. atticus and b. grandii specimens  were then digested using psti in order to obtain psti <dig> and psti <dig> fragments.

fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred into a nylon membrane by southern blotting. two probes were used for hybridization: the first was the xbai <dig> fragment, the latter was a pcr-obtained portion of the 18s gene , amplified with the following universal primers: 18s-s <dig> 5'-taatgatccttccgcaggttca-3'; 18s-a <dig> 5'-tccctggttgatcctgccagta-3', using herculase ii fusion dna polymerase according to manufacturer's instructions. the probes were digoxigenine-labeled and hybridization was performed at 65°c accordingly to dig dna labeling and detection starter kit i ; filters were washed with low stringency buffer , corresponding to ~80% sequence similarity between probe and target.

the fragments xbai <dig>  psti <dig> and psti <dig> from b. atticus from israel  were cloned into a pgem-7zf plasmid  vector using the e. coli dh5α competent cells .  <dig> psti <dig> clones were also obtained by restriction from b. grandii and b. atticus specimens . recombinant clones were screened by pcr using m <dig> universal primers. some of the obtained recombinant colonies were purified using snap miniprep kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

clones were sequenced using m <dig> universal primers by macrogen inc. the portion upstream the 18s gene of the psti <dig> fragment was sequenced using "primer walking" method in b. atticus from israel  , and this allowed us to determine the igs structure in b. atticus.

the psti <dig> fragment was also used as a probe for in situ hybridization according to  <cit>  on b. atticus chromosomes.

given the observed structure of the igs-ets , and to perform a large comparison of igs-etss among bacillus species with a reasonable sequencing effort, we decided not to sequence the whole psti <dig> fragment for all b. grandii and b. atticus specimens, but to focus our attention on the 3' portion of the igs and the ets, from the last psti <dig> repeat and the 5' of the 18s gene . to obtain these fragments, the pcr was performed with herculase  following the manufacturer's instructions. a primer -5'-acaggcaaatgggagttg-3') was designed on the psti530consensus sequences. this primer was then coupled with the 18s universal primer by  <cit> , modified as follows 18i-5'-tttctcaggctccctctccggaatcgaaccct-3'. the pcr products were amplified and completely sequenced using the "primer walking" method as described above. analyzed specimens and genbank accession numbers are reported in table  <dig> 

sequence analyses
all sequences were aligned using the clustal algorithm of the sequence navigator software  and corrected by eye. phylogenetic analyses on psti <dig> and 3'igs-ets were performed using neighbor-joining , maximum parsimony  and maximum likelihood  using paup* v. <dig> b  <cit> . likelihood scores for each dna substitution model were estimated using modeltest and used for subsequent analyses  <cit> . the best-scored model was jc+Γ for psti <dig> and f81+Γ for igs-ets sequences. support for each node was obtained using bootstrap   <cit> . jukes-cantor nucleotide distance values and nucleotide composition were calculated with mega  <dig>   <cit> . nucleotide diversity  distribution across psti <dig> clones and 3'igs-ets were calculated with a  <dig> and  <dig> bp sliding window and step size of  <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively, using dnasp program v. <dig>   <cit> . the conserved and variable regions were considered significant when pi exceed  <dig> × sd  the average pi, as described in  <cit> .

secondary structures were analyzed with the mfold server program  <cit> . to search for the presence of any internal repeat, the 3'igs-ets sequences were analyzed using the server program repfind  <cit> . the neural network promoter prediction tool  <cit>  was used to identify potential promoter sequences.

RESULTS
endonuclease restriction analysis of bacillus atticus showed restriction fragments for xbai and psti: xbai produced a ladder-like pattern, with the shorter band at about  <dig> bp, , which indicates the presence of a tandemly repeated dna. psti produced two main fragments, one of about  <dig> bp , the other at about  <dig>  kb .

southern blot analysis  and sequencing unequivocally revealed that xbai <dig> is part of the psti <dig> sequence, henceforth named bag <dig> 

southern blot analysis also evidenced that the psti <dig> fragment is part of the ribosomal dna, containing both sequences of the 18s gene and bag <dig> . direct sequencing evidenced that the psti <dig> fragment in b. atticus from israel includes part of the last bag <dig> monomer at the 5' end, while at the 3'ends downstream the 18s gene, therefore including the full ets sequence . moreover, in situ hybridization using psti <dig> as a probe evidenced that it localizes in the nor of b. atticus . bag <dig> and 3'igs-ets fragments were then sequenced in b. atticus and b. grandii subspecies, as reported in table  <dig> 

structural organization of the igs-ets in bacillus
in b. atticus and b. grandii, the average nucleotide content of 3'igs-ets sequences is  <dig> % a+t , while the  <dig> bp belonging to the 5'-end of the structural 18s gene show  <dig> % a+t content. on the whole the average length of the 3'igs-ets is  <dig> bp, including  <dig> bp of the 18s gene .

although the boundary between the igs and ets has not being actually determined, we found a motif similar to the transcription start point  sequence of other arthropods, downstream the bag <dig> cluster. the observed motif  well matches to the promoter consensus sequence  of several arthropods , and it has been also confirmed by using the neural network promoter prediction tool, which predicted the same sequence  with a score of  <dig> . assuming that we did find the real gene promoter, ets is therefore  <dig> bp long in b. atticus and  <dig> bp long in b. grandii. this length is quite different from what typically found in other arthropods, where the ets regions are usually 500– <dig> bp long  <cit> , with few exceptions such as daphnia pulex   <cit> .

the bag <dig> repeat
as evidenced by restriction analysis and sequencing, the igs region of bacillus is characterized by an arrays of head-to-tail tandemly-repeated bag <dig> repeats. in this study we sequenced  <dig> bag <dig> repeats obtained from restriction analysis from b. grandii and b. atticus . bag <dig> consensus sequence of  <dig> bp was obtained by aligning the  <dig> sequences; we observed a total of  <dig> indels,  <dig> of which representing a large deletion in all b. grandii grandii clones . average sequence length is  <dig> bp, with variants ranging from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp .

closer sequence examination revealed that bag <dig> repeats could be further divided into three shorter subunits of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> , respectively: a and a' subunits showed  <dig> % of sequence similarity between them. due to the tandemly-arranged structure of bag <dig>  and to the fact that repeat boundaries are usually defined arbitrarily by the restriction site, we could argue that the functional sequence of bag <dig> subrepeats should actually be b-a'-a, because the last bag <dig> monomer of the array appears to be truncated just downstream the a subrepeat . moreover, a putative promoter sequence  occurs in each of the bag <dig> repeats, suggesting that these sequences are actually spacer promoters. this hypothesis is also supported by the presence of a palindromic motif of  <dig> bp in each repeat ,  <dig> bp upstream the putative spacer promoter sequence. in fact, the local fold symmetry created by the palindrome is thought to provide the binding site for dna-binding proteins that are often dimeric, like the ubf factor involved in the machinery of the rna-poli  <cit> .

variability of 3'igs-ets and bag <dig> sequences
in the automictic parthenogen b. atticus the overall mean distances value of 3'igs-ets is  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the distance values among the distinct allozymic and karyological races  show the same order of magnitude when comparing b. atticus cyprius vs.b. atticus carius  and b. atticus cyprius vs. b. atticus atticus , while between b. atticus atticus and b. atticus carius the value is lower . on the other hand, the bisexual b. grandii shows a nearly 6-fold higher overall 3'igs-ets distance value  when compared to the unisexual b. atticus. comparing the different b. grandii subspecies among themselves, the distance values range from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

variability is not evenly distributed along the 3'igs-ets sequence: the sliding window analysis evidenced that nucleotide diversity progressively drops when approaching the 18s gene, which is likely due to selective sweep . moreover, where the putative tsp gene promoter was located, the only observed variation involves a single substitution  in b. grandii benazzii sample . the observed high level of sequence conservation in this region gives further evidence about its structural and functional role for transcription.

the pattern of overall variability of bag <dig> evidenced in b. atticus unisexuals is considerably lower to that of the sexual b. grandii . the values of variability between b. atticus subspecies are: b. atticus cyprius vs.b. atticus carius , b. atticus cyprius vs. b. atticus atticus , b. atticus atticus and b. atticus carius . comparing the b. grandii subspecies, the distance values are: b. grandii maretimi vs. b. grandii benazzi , b. grandii benazzi vs. b. grandii grandii , and b. grandii grandii vs.b. grandii maretimi .

an homogeneous range of variability was found within the populations of b. atticus atticus  and b. atticus carius  and b. atticus cyprius . also within b. grandii grandii and b. grandii benazzi,bag <dig> has similar levels of variability , while b. grandii maretimi showed a distance value equal to  <dig>  ±  <dig> , so that this subspecies seems at the first glance to be more variable than the others. however, it should be noted that such higher value is mainly due to a single bag <dig> clone, only gm/mar1-c <dig> : excluding it from the analysis, the level of variability falls to the value observed for b. grandii grandii and b. grandii benazzi .

it is interesting to note that sequence variability is not uniformly distributed in bag530: two minima fall within the b subunit, one in the region including the palindromic motif of  <dig> bp , and the other in the region including the rna-poli promoter . actually, the promoter-like sequence shows no variation among all clones, as it has been observed in other organisms. it has been supposed that this sequences have the potential to form strong secondary structures suggesting that the region may be under functional constraints.

phylogenetic analysis
neighbor joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood trees based either on bag <dig> clones or 3'igs-ets sequences showed the same basic topology, with clones/sequences of b. atticus and b. grandii falling into two major distinct clades, well supported by bootstrap values. here, for brevity, we report only maximum likelihood trees.

trees based on bag <dig> sequences  showed two major distinct clades: one is given by b. grandii sequences, the other including b. atticus. within b. atticus, clones grouped into two well-supported clusters: the first includes bag <dig> clones of specimens collected in the western part of the species range , while the second includes clones from specimens living in the eastern mediterranean . within each of the two b. atticus clusters, clones are completely intermingled, without any hint of geographical or population trend.

the b. grandii clones fall into three distinct clades, one for each subspecies, with b. grandii benazzi and b. grandii maretimi being more related. a single clone obtained from b. grandii maretimi  shows a peculiar clustering, being more similar to b. grandii benazzii variants . by comparing clones from b. grandii benazzii and b. grandii maretimi,  <dig> diagnostic positions were recognized: gm/mar1c <dig> shows the first nine diagnostic sites typical of b. grandii benazzii, while the last  <dig> are of b. grandii maretimi; therefore gm/mar1c <dig> may be the result of a gene conversion.

the tree based on 3'igs-ets sequences  shows the same basic topology as that based on bag <dig> clones.

discussion
structure of the igs in bacillus
the molecular characterization of the igs-ets region showed that bacillus atticus and b. grandii share the same basic structure and sequence , with only minor variations; this result strongly supports the close phylogenetic relationship between the two species, as already indicated by previous mitochondrial and allozyme analyses .

as already mentioned, igs-ets sequences are fast evolving, and sequence homologies can be quickly lost; however, the observed structure of bacillus igs-ets maintains several characteristics in common with other metazoans. in detail, several organisms, such as xenopus, daphnia, mouse, rat, hamster, etc.  show tandem repeated sequence arrays downstream the 28s gene: for those the role of rna-poli transcription enhancers has been proposed  <cit> . bacillus igs shows repetitive elements of two main types: a large cluster corresponding to the bag <dig> sequences and the twofold bag <dig> direct repeat. downstream the bag <dig> cluster, a conserved putative promoter sequence has been found, which could represent the rna-poli promoter, and the same promoter is also present in each bag <dig> repeat. therefore we are quite confident in interpreting the bag <dig> repeats as rna-poli enhancers.

although no real sequence similarity could be detected, igs enhancers must share the same mechanism of action, which likely is in their secondary structure; for instance, it has been observed that xenopus enhancers work very well in mammals and in plants. because of this common action, coupled with no obvious sequence similarity, enhancers could function as the binding sites of a common transcriptional factor, which most likely is the ubf .

the presence of the bag383a and bag383b repeats in the ets appears to be unique of bacillus so, although they might have some sort of regulatory significance, nothing more precise can be stated at present.

finally, the bacillus rrna at the junction between ets and 18s show the ability to form stem-loop structures, as observed in drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and apis mellifera  <cit> , thus suggesting that this feature is likely important for an exact recognition of the rrna splicing site. the stem-loop structure is formed by the conserved rrna helices h <dig>  h <dig> and h9' flanking the ets region  <cit>  .

pattern of evolution of the igs-ets repeats and the "concerted evolution"
the pattern of variability of bag <dig> is quite different in b. atticus and b. grandii. in b. atticus some degree of geographic structure is observed, while b. grandii shows a more strong geographic and subspecies-specific clustering. this is also confirmed by the whole 3'igs-ets sequence analysis.

in more detail, a few bag <dig> and 3'igs-ets variants are present in b. atticus, although, in theory, the absence of the homogenizing force of sexuality would permit the maintenance of many divergent variants in unisexuals. moreover, bag <dig> and 3'igs-ets sequences evidenced the presence of two clusters in b. atticus, respectively including eastern  and western populations , regardless of subspecies, allozymic race or karyotype they belong to .

as a matter of fact, the presence of a slight geographic structuring of b. atticus bag <dig> might be considered as an unexpected result, since, according to the "concerted evolution" rationale, the automictic b. atticus lacks chromosome reshuffling coupled with mendelian reproduction, and this should prevent "spreading" and "fixation" of variants in the taxonomic unit. in bacillus bag <dig> satellite dna the lack of either geographic or racial clustering was explained this way  <cit> .

how can we explain this result for bag530? first of all, it is relevant to remember that different kinds of selective pressures on tandemly repeated arrays produce different background in which molecular drive is fixing newly occurring variants. although "concerted evolution" applies to igs-ets too, a substantial proportion of newly arisen variants may be eliminated by selection, because this region contains promoters and enhancers interacting with rna-poli machinery  <cit> . this would likely turn in the low variability observed, even in the absence of the homogenizing contribution of sexuality. compared to rdna, the satellite bag <dig> family of bacillus likely undergoes a more relaxed selection, so that unisexuals can maintain more variability in satellite dna.

all that considered, we may speculate that the slight geographic structuring of b. atticus igs-ets might be an outcome of geographically-based co-evolution of the igs-ets rna-poli machinery. with this in mind, we still need to explain how newly arisen igs-ets variants might spread in a large geographical area, in absence of chromosome reshuffling due to sexual reproduction. we can suggest that populations carrying the new variant might have spread from a founding clone of b. atticus females, in which the new variant has been fixed by selection and genomic turnover mechanisms allowed by automictic parthenogenesis. however, another possibility must be mentioned, i.e. that by the time the new variant appeared, b. atticus was still a bisexual taxon. this hypothesis is not unrealistic, since it has been proved that in sicily, at the time that the tri-hybrid b. lynceorum arose from b. rossius females , b. atticus males had to be present to form the hybrid  <cit> . at present, however, b. atticus males have never been observed in nature, although the species has been intensively collected.

in b. grandii, the pattern of variability of bag <dig> and 3'igs-ets might be explained by bisexuality acting as a driving force on repeated sequence homogenization/fixation in the same genomic pool , coupled with the co-evolution of the rdna arrays within each gene pool. the result is a clear racial clustering of the bag <dig> repeats, which is fully in line with what has been observed for the bag <dig> satellite dna family  <cit> . moreover, the invention of a recombinant clone between two bag <dig> variants of b. grandii benazzii and b. grandii maretimi must be an outcome of the coexistence of both variants in the same genome, either now in the genome of b. grandii maretimi, or in a common ancestor of the subspecies, which are nowadays no longer sympatric. a very similar recombination event has been observed in the bag <dig> satellite dna of b. rossius  <cit> .

studies on satellite dnas evidenced the occurrence of the so-called "library hypothesis" based on the "expansion-contraction" model: related taxa could share low-copy repetitive dna sequences that can be specifically amplified in each evolutionary unit, thus becoming highly represented in one taxon while remaining at a low copy number in the others  <cit> . in agreement with the "library hypothesis", mestrovic et al.  <cit>  have recently proposed that rapid changes in satellite dna profiles  could be achieved through replacements of functionally equivalent repeats of dna, without affecting the dna-proteins binding. the existence of specific profiles as a consequence of copy number changes in a set of satellite dnas shared by related genomes was found in species of the insects palorus and pimelia  <cit> ,bacillus  <cit>  and in root-knot nematodes  <cit> .

therefore, the bag <dig> gm/mar1c <dig> clone might be in line with the "library hypothesis" of repeated dna, since the observed recombination event should have occurred when both variants were present in the same genome; so we can speculate that rdna enhancers, and likely the igs-ets itself, might experience the same "expansion-contraction" mechanism described for other repeated dnas.

CONCLUSIONS
all that considered, rdna might be constrained by a complex array of evolutionary mechanisms: repeats homogenization achieved through genomic turnover mechanism may stabilize interactions with dna-binding protein thus eliminating or limiting the effects of deleterious mutations  but, simultaneously, the whole array could acquire new sequence variants, better fitting the above mentioned interactions . the co-evolution can in turn be driven in a dual way, either by direct acquisition of newly mutated repeats, or by competition among repeats that better fit to the above mentioned dna-proteins interactions. in this way, both dna-binding proteins and repeat variants would drive each other's evolution leading to a new protein/dna pair to replace the old one  <cit> . all this, coupled with sexuality might drive quick fixation of new rdna variants in populations.
