BACKGROUND
the lexa protein was first characterized as the transcriptional regulator of the sos response in escherichia coli  <cit> , and later in several other bacteria, including bacillus subtilis  <cit>  and fibrobacter succinogenes  <cit> . in fact, the lexa gene is found in almost all eubacterial groups examined so far  <cit> . in e. coli, around  <dig> genes involved in the sos response are under the regulation of lexa  <cit> . under normal growth conditions, lexa represses the sos response genes by binding to their promoter regions, and thus blocking their transcription. when dna is damaged, the binding of reca to the released single-stranded dna induces the auto-cleavage of the ala84-gly <dig> peptide bond  <cit>  in lexa, thereby inhibiting the dimerization of lexa and preventing its binding to dna  <cit> . in this manner, sos response genes are de-repressed and expressed at different time points and different levels in a coordinated way  <cit> .

lexa in e. coli consists of an n-terminal dna-binding domain and a c-terminal dimerization domain  <cit> . the n-terminal contains three α-helices  and an anti-parallel β-sheet  <cit> . helices ii and iii form a helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif, and all the dna-contacting residues ser <dig>  asn <dig>  ala <dig>  glu <dig> and glu <dig> are located in helix iii  <cit>  as revealed by both nmr  <cit>  and x-ray crystallography analyses  <cit> . the lexa-binding sites in e. coli were found to be a 16-bp palindromic motif with the consensus sequence ctg5cag  <cit> . it has been shown that two reactive residues ser <dig> and lys <dig> in e. coli lexa are critical for the auto-hydrolysis of the peptide bond ala84-gly <dig>  <cit> . the core set of the sos response system consists of lexa, reca, uvrabcd, umucd and ruvb  <cit> . upon the auto-hydrolysis of lexa, the uvrabcd operon is expressed first, whose products are responsible for the nucleotide excision repair . then reca and several other genes for homologous recombination are expressed, retrieving the excised dna double strands. next, the cell division inhibitor sfia is induced to guarantee a sufficient time for the dna repairing to be completed. in the end, if the dna is not completely repaired, the operon umucd encoding the mutagenic dna repair polymerase pol v will be induced to perform translesion dna synthesis  <cit> . since the lexa gene itself is also under the control of lexa, after the damaged dna is repaired, the activity of reca declines, the production of lexa surpasses its auto-cleavage. consequently, the increased concentration of lexa restores the inhibition of the expression of the sos response genes.

more recently, lexa homologs were also experimentally studied in a few cyanobacteria  <cit> . these studies suggest that lexa in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit>  binds to the promoter regions of lexa and reca; however, lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> may regulate different genes/systems other than the sos system. domain et al. concluded from microarray gene profiling analysis  <cit>  that lexa in this species might be involved in carbon metabolism. later, lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> was found to regulate the crhr gene encoding a rna helicase  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that the transcription of the bidirectional hydrogenase genes hoxefuyh was regulated by lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> <cit> . in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  hoxefuyh genes are split into two separate operons, and lexa was found to bind to the upstream regions for both operons  <cit> . mazon et al.  <cit>  showed that the lexa-binding sites in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig> have a 14-bp pseudo-palindromic structure in the form of rgtacnnndgtwcb, which are similar to those in b. subtilis. additionally, sjöholm et al.  <cit>  found two putative palindromic lexa-binding sites: one in the promoter region of alr0750-hoxe-hoxf that resembles mazon's lexa boxes <cit> , and another, ttacactttaa in the upstream region of hoxu in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  meanwhile, multiple putative lexa boxes were identified in synechocystis sp. pcc6803: a 13-bp pseudo-palindromic segment agtaactagttcg in the upstream region of hoxe, which is similar to mazon's site but with one base deletion  <cit> ; another direct repeat pattern, cta-n9-cta proposed to be recognized by lexa in vitro  <cit> ; and two putative lexa boxes that resemble none of the putative lexa boxes listed above  <cit> . despite this progress, a more extensive study of lexa proteins and their binding sites and regulons in cyanobacterial genomes is still needed. in this study, we have predicted lexa-binding sites and regulons in all the sequenced cyanobacterial genomes that harbor a lexa gene, and analyzed the evolutionary changes in the lexa regulons in cyanobacteria, as well as their relationship with those in proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria.

RESULTS
conservation of the dna-binding domain of lexa in cyanobacteria
we identified orthologs of the lexa protein in nostoc sp. pcc <dig>  in  <dig> of the  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genomes using the bi-directional best hit  method based on blastp search with an e-value cutoff 10- <dig> . seven genomes appear not to harbor a lexa gene under this criterion, namely, gloeobacter violaceus pcc <dig>  synechococcus sp. ja-3-3ab a-prime, synechococcus sp. ja-2-3b'a b-prime, synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig>  synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig>  trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> and thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  we removed the synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig> genome from our study since synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig> is virtually identical to it  <cit> . however, an ortholog of the lexa gene  does exist in gloeobacter violaceus pcc <dig>  the reason we failed to identify this ortholog is that it does not meet our bdbh criterion due to its largely divergent sequence. the phylogenetic tree of these  <dig> lexa amino acid sequences indicates that they can be clustered into three groups , corresponding to the previously described clade a , clade c , and clade b   <cit> . however, aside from gloeobacter violaceus pcc <dig>  the dna-binding domains  of lexa from these cyanobacteria are highly conserved , especially the helix iii, where dna-contacting residues are located  <cit> . this result is in agreement with earlier observations  <cit> . this provides the rationale of our analysis, including the phylogenetic footprinting analysis  and genome-wide scanning for lexa-binding site predictions. on the other hand, since the dbd in gloeobacter violaceus pcc <dig> is quite different from those in other cyanobacteria, especially where the dna-contacting residues locate, thus, we excluded it from our study, leaving  <dig> species/strains for the putative lexa regulon prediction.

lexa-binding sites predicted by phylogenetic footprinting
we considered both an operon and a singleton gene as a transcription unit . as mazon et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated the binding of lexa to the upstream regions of two genes, lexa and reca, and predicted lexa-binding sites for other four genes  in nostoc sp pcc <dig>  we used phylogenetic footprinting to identify possible lexa-binding sites in the pooled  <dig> inter-tu sequences associated with these six genes in nostoc sp. pcc <dig>  <cit>  and their orthologs in the other  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes  that harbor a lexa gene . we identified  <dig> high-scoring 14-bp palindromic sequences  out of the  <dig> input sequences by applying the motif finding tools meme  <cit>  and bioprospector  <cit>  and incorporating the best motifs found by these two programs . however, the putative lexa box agtcctagagtcct  identified in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> was not identified by patterson-fortin et al.  <cit>  using dnasei footprinting assays or by gutekunst et al.  <cit> . therefore, we removed this site, leaving  <dig> putative lexa-binding sites  for profile construction. the two lexa boxes that have been characterized in nostoc sp pcc  <dig>  <cit>  were accurately recovered by the phylogenetic footprinting procedure , suggesting that most of these high-scoring motifs are likely to be genuine lexa boxes. these putative lexa-binding sites show either a strong palindromic structure similar to the experimentally characterized lexa boxes in nostoc sp. pcc <dig>  <cit> , or a tandem repeat structure with the consensus sequence agtacwnwtgtact. as demonstrated in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  this pattern is rather similar to the consensus sequence of the lexa-binding sites previously identified in b. subitlis   <cit> , and to a less extent, to that of lexa-binding sites found in α-proteobacteria   <cit> , but differs remarkably from that in e. coli ctg5cag  <cit> . these results are consistent with our phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> lexa proteins detected in  <dig> genomes, showing that lexa proteins in cyanobacteria are more closely related to those in gram-positive and α-proteobacteria bacteria than to those in γ-proteobacteria . accordingly, since the lexa-binding sites in b. subtilis  <cit>  have a palindromic structure, it is not surprising that the lexa-binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes might have a similar palindromic structure.

genome-wide prediction of lexa-binding sites and regulons in cyanobacterial genomes
both consensus sequence and position weight matrix  have been widely used to represent the pattern of similar sequences. the advantage of pwm  methods over the consensus sequence methods is that the former can capture more quantitative information about the patterns by using a probabilistic model to represent the sequences. in this way, it can differentiate subtly conserved positions from the non-conserved ones  <cit> . in our study, we used the profile of these  <dig> lexa boxes  to scan the  <dig> sequenced cyanobacterial genomes to predict additional putative lexa-binding sites and members of lexa regulons, using a scanning algorithm  <cit>  that incorporates orthologous information and computes a log-odds ratio  score for evaluating the confidence of predictions in each genome . the predicted results with a p-value <  <dig>  for the  <dig> genomes harboring a lexa gene are listed in table s1- <dig> , while those for the five genomes without a lexa gene are listed in table s27- <dig> . the predicted results with a p-value <  <dig>  for the  <dig> cyanobacteria are summarized in table s32- <dig> .

the score of a detected putative lexa binding site for a tu is the sum of two terms: one evaluates the extent to which the putative lexa binding site resembles the scanning profile; the other evaluates the similarity of this binding site to those identified for the orthologs of genes within the tu in the other genomes. to evaluate the confidence of each motif score s, we used randomly selected coding sequences as the null model to test the statistical significance. a false positive rate was used to evaluate this statistical significance, which was defined as the fraction of the randomly selected coding sequences containing binding sites with a score higher than the cutoff s in the genome. we chose randomly selected coding regions as the null model based on the assumption that a coding sequence is less likely to contain cis-regulatory binding sites than an intergenic sequence. although it might be possible for genuine lexa boxes to occur in coding regions  <cit> , such kind of binding sites should be rare. the lor function for a genome evaluates the ratio of the fraction of the inter-tu sequences containing a binding site with a score higher than s to the fraction of the randomly selected coding sequences containing a binding site with a score higher than the same s in the genome. accordingly, positive lor values that increase monotonically with the increase in binding site sores would suggest that an inter-tu sequence is more likely to contain a high-scoring lexa-binding site than does a randomly selected coding sequence in the genome.

as shown in figure  <dig>  when the motif score s increases beyond some value, the lor is generally high for most of the  <dig> cyanobacteria that harbor a lexa gene, therefore those genomes with high lor values are likely to contain some true binding sites. exceptions exist in five genomes, namely, cyanothece sp. pcc  <dig>  synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  synechococcus rcc <dig>  synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  and microcystis aeruginosa nies- <dig>  in which the lor curves oscillate around zero when binding site score s increases. these poor lor values might suggest that there are not more high-scoring lexa-binding sites in the inter-tu regions than in the coding regions in the five genomes. the reason for this could be that our scanning algorithm rewards a binding site that is shared by orthologs in the other genomes. if a true binding site is unique to a genome, then it will not score high. in this sense, lexa is probably no longer a major sos response regulator in these genomes. instead, it might have become a specific local regulator during the course of evolution to adapt to their unique living environments . in the case of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  it is noted that the lexa-binding sites identified by patterson-fortin et al.  <cit>  are totally different from those identified by mazon et al.  <cit> , and that the lexa sequence in this genome is largely divergent from those in the other genomes . accordingly, the lexa binding sites in this genome might differ in some way from those in the other genomes, which can be another reason for its low lor values.

in contrast, as shown in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the lor values in the five genomes that do not harbor a lexa gene  b-prime, synechococcus elongatus pcc  <dig>  thermosynechococcus elongates bp- <dig> and trichodesmium erythraeum ims101) oscillate around or decrease below zero when the motif score s increases beyond a certain value, implying that the chance to find a relative high-scoring putative lexa-binding site in an inter-tu region is not higher than in a randomly chosen coding sequence, suggesting that these genomes are unlikely to contain functional lexa-binding sites. on the other hand, the lor values in the three genomes synechococcus sp. ja-3-3ab a-prime, synechococcus sp. ja-2-3b'a  b-prime and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> are relatively higher than those in the other two genomes , or even could be comparable to those of the five poor-lor-valued cyanobacteria that harbor a lexa gene . in fact, the numbers of predicted binding sites in the three genomes are not too small , which suggests that a few putative lexa-like binding sites exist in these genomes. a possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that these lexa-like binding sites are recognized by other transcription factors that have similar dna-binding domains to that of lexa. the predictions of lexa regulons in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that harbor a lexa gene are summarized in table  <dig> 

conservation and diversity of the putative lexa regulons in cyanobacteria
to investigate how well the predicted lexa regulons in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes are conserved, we constructed a lexa regulon conservation tree based on the pairwise comparison of the predicted lexa regulons in these genomes . as shown in figure  <dig>  these genomes are divided into two groups. interestingly, one group is exclusively comprised of marine strains, and the other group contains the remaining genomes isolated from different non-marine habitats. in the former group, high light  adapted and low light  adapted ecotypes are largely grouped into two sub-groups. the results suggest that the composition of lexa regulons is dependent on the habitat of the organisms to a large extent. the general topology of the tree  is basically consistent with both the 16s rrna gene tree  and the lexa protein tree of these genomes . furthermore, both the hl and ll adapted marine sub-groups are very compact, indicating that the predicted lexa regulons in both sub-groups are relatively conserved. in contrast, the species in the non-marine habitats are not so close to one another , suggesting that the putative lexa regulons in these genomes share few genes with one another except for the closely related anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> and nostoc sp. pcc <dig>  the tree also indicates that microcystis aeruginosa nies  <dig> and synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> have the most distinct lexa regulons from other cyanobacterial genomes .

functional classification of putative lexa regulons in cyanobacteria
predicted members of lexa regulons in the  <dig> cyanobacteria that harbor a lexa gene are listed in tables s1-s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  their functions can be summarized as follows.

 <dig>  sos response system
as shown in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  all the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes included in this study encode a few sos response genes found in e. coli. several of the sos genes in some of the  <dig> genomes that harbor a lexa gene bear a high-scoring putative lexa-binding site in their regulatory regions . in particular, two of the core sos response genes  <cit> , namely, reca and lexa, are among the most conserved putative lexa targets in the  <dig> cyanobacterial species/strains . in addition, the umuc and umud genes encoded in  <dig> genomes are also predicted to bear a putative lexa-binding site in their promoter regions . these results suggest that as in e. coli, the sos response in most cyanobacteria might still be regulated by lexa. however, the other sos response genes were found to bear a putative lexa-binding site only in a few genomes . for instance, a high-scoring lexa-binding site for the ruvb gene encoding holliday junction dna helicase b was found only in hl adapted prochlorococcus ecotypes mit <dig>  mit <dig>  mit <dig>  med <dig> and as <dig>  moreover, in the case of the nucleotide excision repair  genes uvra, b, c and d, which are under the regulation of lexa in e. coli  <cit> , we were able to identify putative lexa-binding sites only in the promoter regions of the uvra and uvrb in nostoc sp. pcc <dig> and the promoter region of uvrd in prochlorococcus marinus mit  <dig> . thus, it is likely that the ner process in the remaining genomes is regulated by some transcription factor other than lexa, given that uvr genes are present in all the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes analyzed in this study, including those that do not encode a lexa gene . these results are consistent with the earlier observation that lexa target genes in bacteria are highly diversified in order for them to adapt to different ecological niches  <cit> .

on the other hand, in synechococcus pcc <dig>  synechococcus rcc <dig> and synechococcus wh <dig>  lexa boxes were only detected for one of the core sos response genes, i.e., synpcc7002_a <dig>  in synechococcus pcc <dig>  synrcc307_ <dig>  in synechococcus rcc <dig> and synwh7803_ <dig>  in synechococcus wh <dig>  although these genomes all encode a lexa gene and other core sos response genes, such as reca  and ruvb , umuc  and umud . since only one single sos response gene bears a putative lexa box in these genomes, it is likely that the role of lexa in the regulation of the sos response in these genomes might have been attenuated. the case of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> seems to go even further in this direction as detailed below.

as indicated previously  <cit> , the lexa protein of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> is unusual in two aspects compared to those in the other genomes analyzed in this study. first, as shown in figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the ala-gly dyad in the n-terminus of lexa responsible for auto-cleavage of the protein in all other cyanobacteria as well as in e. coli and b. subtilis  <cit>  are replaced by gly-gly in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  second, the reactive residue ser  that attacks the ala-gly peptide bond is replaced by asp of lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  <cit> . it has been shown that sos induction cannot be initiated by a non-cleavable lexa repressor  <cit> . therefore, it is highly likely that lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> cannot undergo the auto-cleavage reaction in response to dna damage, and it might have adopted a different function other than the canonical sos response regulator seen in e. coli and b. subtilis  <cit> . this argument is consistent with the observation that synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> has a notably larger branch length in the  <dig> lexa protein tree , but this is not seen in the 16s rrna gene tree .

although the synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> genome harbors some core sos response genes including lexa and reca , none of them belongs to our predicted lexa regulon at a p-value <  <dig>  . the muts  gene is the only gene that is likely to be in involved in dna mismatch repair, while bearing a putative lexa binding site in the genome. however, the orthologs of muts is not under the regulation of lexa in e. coli  <cit>  or within the putative lexa regulon of any other cyanobacteria . these results suggest that at least most of sos response genes are not under the regulation of lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  indeed, using microarray gene expression profiling in response to lexa depletion, domain et al.  <cit>  concluded that lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> might be involved in carbon metabolism or controlled by carbon availability rather than the regulation of sos response. however, our predicted lexa regulon in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  has no intersection with the lexa-responsive genes identified by domain et al.  <cit> . since the lexa-binding sites that were experimentally characterized  <cit>  in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> are different from the sequences in our scanning profile, and considering the distinct nature of the lexa protein in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> indicated above, it would be particular interesting to determine by experiment the function of the predicted sites in this genome.

thus, although synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> clearly harbors the components of a basic sos response system , it is probably no longer under the regulation of lexa. accordingly, lexa in this genome might have adopted a different function. thus, the loss of the original function of lexa in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> is coupled with the loss of the sequence constraint, thereby accelerating its divergence from other cyanobacterial lexa proteins, at both the sequence and functional levels. on the other hand, given the importance of the sos response in cell survival, it is highly likely that the transcriptional regulator of the sos response system in synechocystissp. pcc <dig> has been replaced by another protein.

 <dig>  other cellular processes
interestingly, we also found putative lexa-binding sites in the regulatory regions of genes that participate in various cellular processes in these  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes . the major cellular processes that are likely under the regulation of lexa are summarized below.

 <dig>  photosynthesis
putative lexa-binding sites were predicted for the following photosynthetic genes in the  <dig> cyanobacteria that harbor a lexa gene with p <  <dig> : ava_ <dig>  a9601_ <dig>  pmm <dig>  p9215_ <dig>  p9301_ <dig>  pmt9312_ <dig>  and p9515_ <dig>  coding for a photosystem ii reaction center protein psby; slr <dig>  coding for the photosystem ii cp <dig> protein; and mae_ <dig>  pmt9312_ <dig>  pmn2a_1682a and synpcc7002_a <dig>  coding for a protein involved in photosystem i. these results suggest that the sos response system might have cross-talk with photosynthesis in those genomes.

 <dig> . transporters
around  <dig> genes encoding transporters were predicted to bear a putative lexa box . most of them belong to the abc transporter proteins, including am1_ <dig> in acaryochloris marina mbic <dig>  ava_ <dig> in anabaena variabilis atcc <dig>  mae_ <dig> in microcystis aeruginosa nies <dig>  npun_f <dig> in nostoc punctiforme pcc <dig>  alr <dig> in nostoc sp pcc <dig>  p9215_ <dig> in prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig>  p9303_ <dig> in prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig>  p9515_ <dig> in prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig>  synw <dig> in synechococcus sp wh <dig> and slr <dig> in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  in addition, several toxin and antibiotics exporters were identified to have a putative lexa-binding site in their regulatory regions, including cadmium resistance transporter ava_ <dig> in anabaena variabilis atcc29413; mfs  multidrug efflux transporter p9301_ <dig> in prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig> and a9601_ <dig> in prochlorococcus marinus as9601; multidrug efflux abc transporter p9515_ <dig> in prochlorococcus marinus mit <dig> and synw <dig> in synechococcus sp wh8102; putative abc transporter/multidrug efflux family protein synw <dig> in synechococcus sp wh8102; drug exporter- <dig> abc transporter atpase subunit am1_ <dig> in acaryochloris marina mbic <dig>  these findings are interesting since it has been shown that the sos response system is related to drug resistance in e. coli  <cit>  and staphylococcus aureus  <cit>  by mechanisms that are not fully understood. it was reported that the vp <dig> gene encoding a toxin exporter responsible for xenobiotic resistance in vibrionales parahaemolyticus was under the direct control of lexa  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that these drug resistance genes are regulated by lexa, thereby coupling the sos response to drug resistance in these cyanobacteria.

the origin of the lexa gene in cyanobacteria
as indicated earlier,  <dig> of the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes analyzed evidently harbor a lexa ortholog, while the remaining five genomes do not, even when being scrutinized by more sensitive sequence search methods such as psi-blast . the five cyanobacteria lacking a lexa are synechococcus sp. ja-3-3ab a-prime, synechococcus sp. ja-2-3b'a b-prime, synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig>  trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> and thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  however, the core sos response genes remain in these five genomes . in the tree of  <dig> detected lexa proteins in  <dig> sequenced genomes , the  <dig> cyanobacterial lexa proteins that are detected by bdbh  form a monophyletic group while lexa in gloeobacter violaceus pcc <dig> is clustered with the group of α-proteobacteria. furthermore, the topology of the 16s rrna gene tree  and the lexa tree/subtree of  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes  are quite similar. this result suggests that lexa in the  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes  is likely to be vertically inherited from the last common ancestor of cyanobacteria. however, gloeobacter violaceus pcc <dig> might have lost its lexa protein during evolution and obtained an ortholog later through horizontal transfer from an α-proteobacterium. the five genomes that lack a lexa gene do not form a monophyletic group in the 16s rrna gene-based phylogenetic tree of these  <dig> cyanobacteria . in particular, synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig>  and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> are spread in a clade whose members except these two genomes harbor a lexa gene. the most parsimonious explanation of this distribution would be that these two genomes synechococcus elongatus pcc <dig> and trichodesmium erythraeum ims <dig> lost their lexa genes through two independent events  to adapt to their corresponding environments during the course of evolution. furthermore, the remaining three genomes, thermosynechococcus elongatus bp- <dig>  synechococcus sp. ja-3-3ab a-prime and synechococcus sp. ja-2-3b'a  b-prime, which do not possess a lexa gene, branch earlier from the others . a plausible explanation of this distribution would be that these genomes lost their lexa genes inherited from the last common ancestor of cyanobacteria during the course of evolution. interestingly, all these three genomes are thermophilic, their extreme ecological niches might facilitate the loss of the lexa gene. since the core sos response genes remain in these five genomes  after lexa was lost, they might have been hijacked by another transcription factor given the importance of the regulation of the sos response genes for cell survival. the genomes that lost their lexa gene appear to have lost lexa-binding sites . alternatively, these five cyanobacteria might still harbor a lexa gene that has largely diverged from the others' during evolution to such a level that our method could not detect them.

in addition, it has been suggested that the lexa gene was derived from gram-positive bacteria, which then spread into cyanobacteria and fibrobacteres. then α-proteobacteria acquired lexa from cyanobacteria  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis of the lexa proteins and their binding sites supports such an argument. as mentioned before, cyanobacterial lexa proteins are more closely-related to those in gram-positive bacteria and α-proteobacteria than those in the other groups , and the predicted lexa-binding sites in cyanobacteria are clustered together with those in the gram-positive bacterium b. subtilis and in α-proteobacteria, but are far away from those in e. coli .

moreover, erill et al.  <cit>  have suggested that there is a common set of genes in the lexa regulon of proteobacteria and gram-positive bacteria: reca, uvra, ssb, and ruvc. however, our predicted lexa regulons in cyanobacteria do not always include this set of genes. thus, the concept of a common set of sos response gene in its more general form warrants further scrutinization.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have predicted lexa-binding sites and analyzed the putative lexa regulons in  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes that harbor a lexa gene using a highly efficient motif scanning and regulon prediction algorithm. in most lexa-containing cyanobacterial genomes, some sos response genes bear a putative lexa box. some genes involved in various cellular processes such as photosynthesis, drug resistance, etc. are also predicted to bear a putative lexa box in their promoter regions. however, in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  lexa might have adopted a new function and no longer be in charge of the sos response genes. in some genomes, lexa was likely lost during the course of evolution accompanied by the loss of its binding sites. the sos response genes in these genomes that appear to lack a lexa gene might be regulated by another or multiple transcription factors. moreover, we conclude that cyanobacteria inherited the lexa gene from their last common ancestor; however, substantial genome-wide turnover seems to have led to the high degree of variation of the lexa regulons in some species during evolution.
