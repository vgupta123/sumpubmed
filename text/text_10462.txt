BACKGROUND
antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has emerged as a problem in both human and veterinary medicine. one of the currently most important resistance mechanisms in enterobacteriaceae, which reduces the efficacy even of modern expanded-spectrum cephalosporins  and monobactams is based on plasmid-mediated production of enzymes that inactivate these compounds by hydrolyzing their β-lactam ring. such resistance is encoded by an increasing number of different point-mutational variants of classical broad-spectrum β-lactamases . these variants are called extended spectrum β-lactamases : most are derivates of tem and shv β-lactamase families, whereas other groups, such as ctx-m, per and kpc β-lactamases have been described more recently  <cit> . the phenotypical difference between bsbls and esbls is that the latter efficiently hydrolyze 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins, additionally to penicillins and lower generation cephalosporins as the bsbls are capable of. bsbls and esbls are inhibited by clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam  <cit> , a feature that is used  as a criterion for classification of β-lactamases and  for diagnostic esbl detection purposes. until now more than  <dig> esbl variants are known http://www.lahey.org/studies/ . among them, the over  <dig> ctx-m enzymes so far reported may be grouped into five main subgroups. each of them is characterized by a group-representative single structure according to their amino acid sequence   <cit> . as a matter of growing concern, resistance caused by esbls is often associated with resistance to other classes of antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfmethoxazole  <cit> .

since the first description of esbl producing enterobacteriaceae isolated from hospitalized humans  <cit> , many nosocomial outbreaks have been reported. however, since a few years, there is an increase in the detection of esbl producing strains in the community  <cit> . more recently, reports have also raised concern about the dissemination of esbl producing e. coli in healthy food producing animals in several countries in europe  <cit>  and asia  <cit>  or in food products like meat, fish and raw milk  <cit> . recently, wittum et al.  <cit>  and doi et al.  <cit>  described for the first time esbl producers in healthy dairy cattle and retail meat in the usa.

therefore, the impact of healthy farm animals as a possible reservoir for esbl producing enterobacteriaceae on the food processing chain has to be assessed. the aim of the present study was to screen for the occurrence of esbl producing enterobacteriaceae in healthy swine, cattle, sheep and chicken at slaughter as well as in milk and meat in switzerland and to further characterize isolates.

RESULTS
after an enrichment step esbl producers were isolated from  <dig>  of the investigated  <dig> fecal samples, and one esbl producer  was found in  <dig> e. coli mastitis milk isolates, but none was isolated from either minced meat  or bulk tank milk samples. the esbl prevalence among cattle was  <dig> %,  <dig> % among calves ,  <dig> % among sheep, and  <dig> % among pigs. for chickens  a very high prevalence of  <dig> % was determined . all suspected isolates were phenotypically confirmed, in that they showed a synergy effect with at least  <dig> of  <dig> strips when tested with etest-esbl strips containing cefepime, cefotaxime or ceftazidime, and they yielded factors >  <dig> when ratios of mic /mic  were calculated.

a) it is known that many esbl producers may appear susceptible or intermediate to oxyimino cephalosporins in vitro if clsi criteria are applied strictly, but do not respond to the respective therapies. consequently, for clinical reporting these results have to be corrected to "resistant".

the esbl-encoding genes of all isolates were further characterized by pcr. a total of  <dig> isolates  produced ctx-m group  <dig> esbls while six isolates  produced ctx-m group  <dig> enzymes. five isolates  were detected as producers of the shv-esbls and  <dig> isolates  exclusively produced tem-type enzymes. twenty-seven ctx-m carriers were additionally pcr-positive for blatem genes. of the  <dig> esbl producing isolates,  <dig> were selected for sequencing of the involved bla genes . thirty-four isolates were ctx-m- <dig> producers, eight expressed additional tem- <dig> and one isolate--from a pig-- additionally expressed a tem-type enzyme, tem- <dig> http://www.lahey.org/studies/, never found before . six isolates carried ctx-m- <dig> with tem- <dig> and five isolates specified ctx-m- <dig>  one of which producing additional tem- <dig>  one isolate from a calf produced tem- <dig> in combination with ctx-m- <dig> http://www.lahey.org/studies/, a novel ctx-m group  <dig> esbl with an amino acid sequence never found before . finally, two tem- <dig> esbl producers, and  <dig> shv- <dig> carriers were found, three of the latter featuring additional tem- <dig> .

besides the β-lactam resistances, the isolates were also tested for resistance to other classes of antibiotics. we found  <dig>  out of  <dig> isolates resistant to tetracycline ,  <dig> isolates  resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ,  <dig> isolates  resistant to nalidixic acid  and  <dig>  resistant to at least one aminoglycoside . furthermore,  <dig> isolates  showed resistance against chloramphenicol , and  <dig> isolates  showed resistance against ciprofloxacin . one isolate from chicken faeces showed only resistance to ß-lactam-antibiotics, and none of the tested isolates was resistant to imipenem .

discussion
recently, an increase in studies, carried out in different countries, and describing the prevalence and characteristics of esbl producing enterobacteriaceae in cattle for example  <cit>  and in pigs and chicken for example  <cit>  were published. moreover, some studies describing esbl producing enterobacteriaceae in salads  <cit> , in meat  <cit>  and in raw milk  <cit>  are available. since there seem to be geographical variations in the occurrence of different esbl variants , it is therefore important to have a detailed overview based on geographical distribution and this knowledge was so far limited in switzerland. therefore, the present study provides further data concerning healthy animals , minced meat and bulk tank milk samples in switzerland.

the high esbl occurrence determined for all investigated animals in this study is surprising, given the fact that switzerland is a country with a strict policy of antibiotic use  <cit> . nevertheless, one reason could be the use of β-lactams--and even 4th generation cephalosporins--in veterinary medicine  <cit> . another reason could be co-selection of multiple resistance mechanisms through the use of various antibiotics, due to the fact that resistance genes for aminoglycosides, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole are frequently placed on single conjugative plasmids, as is often also the case with blaesbl genes  <cit> . for food producing animals very limited data on the occurrence of esbl producing enterobacteriaceae had been available before in switzerland, but there is a study about ctx-m producers in swiss patients  <cit> , and a recent report about occurrence of esbl carriers in the healthy swiss human population   <cit> . this is lower than the rates from food animals  presented in this study. these frequencies primarily imply a reservoir of esbl producers in farm animals. supporting this view, a study from the netherlands described the same ctx-m-type in chicken meat and humans  <cit> . in switzerland, these findings cannot be confirmed because of the predominance of ctx-m- <dig> in animals and the predominance of ctx-m- <dig> in humans  <cit> . the predominance of ctx-m group  <dig> enzymes and the rare prevalence of ctx-m group  <dig>  as seen in our study, has also recently been described in strains from healthy food-producing animals in denmark, portugal and france  <cit> . all of the tem enzymes co-expressed alongside with ctx-m esbls were broad-spectrum β-lactamases--mostly tem-1--conveying no esbl phenotype. in contrast, two strains, expressing tem enzymes exclusively, featured the tem-esbl tem- <dig> . in other countries tem-esbls are much more frequently found in animals, especially in chickens  <cit> .

given the relatively high occurrence of esbl producers in fecal samples from animals in our study, it is striking, that no esbl producers could be found in either bulk tank milk or beef and pork minced meat. we hypothesise that the very high hygiene standards for slaughtering together with the selection of the raw meat for minced meat production and the quality based prizing system of bulk tank milk in switzerland could be the reason for this favourable situation.

CONCLUSIONS
the occurrence of esbl producing enterobacteriaceae in the fecal microflora of farm animals represents an obvious risk for contamination of raw food products from animal origin. however, since no esbl producers were found in the examined food samples and our data concerning the esbl type distribution in animals compared to healthy human carriers do not correlate well, animal food products can hardly be the major vector for eslb carriage in the human population in switzerland. nevertheless, due to the generally high esbl occurrence in food animals in switzerland prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and strict hygiene measures during slaughtering and milking still remain important.

finally, on the basis of the massive ctx-m- <dig> predominance in animals in our study compared to its relatively low frequency in healthy humans, further investigational efforts into the origin of the unexplained high occurrence of ctx-m- <dig> in the human population are warrented.
