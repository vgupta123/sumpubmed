BACKGROUND
the recently described type vi secretion system  represents a new paradigm of protein secretion in bacteria maintaining pathogenic or symbiotic interactions with eukaryotic organisms . in this context, t6sss have been linked to a variety of functions such as adherence, cytotoxicity, host-cell invasion, biofilm formation, survival within macrophages, and persistence within the host  <cit> .

t6ss are encoded in loci initially known as iahp  clusters. these gene clusters were characterized by the presence of approximately  <dig> orfs surrounding a homolog of icmf, a protein associated with type iv secretion in legionella pneumophila  <cit> . in addition to the variable genetic architecture presented by ihaps in several microbial genomes, low level of sequence identity between components of the system in different bacteria has hampered the identification of new t6ss loci. in spite of this, in silico analyses identified a set of  <dig> conserved proteins defined as the t6ss "core components"  <cit> . these components carry a distinct cog id , most of which are unique for t6ss function  <cit> . in addition, there are  <dig> conserved accessory proteins widely distributed among t6ss loci that include specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators  <cit> .

most t6ss core components correspond to structural elements of the secretion machinery. the dotu and icmf homologs  are conserved inner membrane proteins essential for secretion  <cit> . a role for icmf and dotu homologs in membrane stabilization of the t6ss apparatus has been proposed based on observations made for homolog proteins involved in stabilization of the t4ss apparatus in l. pneumophila  <cit> . the clpv homologs  belong to the aaa+ family of atpases and are hypothesized to energize the system, enabling protein secretion  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that v. cholerae clpv interacts through its n-terminal domain with a tubular structure formed by vipa  and vipb , two conserved and essential t6ss components. remodeling of vipa/vipb tubules by clpv-mediated threading is crucial for type vi protein secretion  <cit> . in addition, it has been recently proposed that the vipa/vipb structure corresponds to a structural and possibly functional homolog of the tail sheath in bacteriophage t <dig>  as both structures present similar dimensions, symmetry and overall organization  <cit> .

several other t6ss core components resemble proteins of bacteriophage origin. this is the case of the hemolysin coregulated protein hcp , the valine-glycine repeat protein vgrg  and the gp25-like protein , which are homologs to components of the tail and baseplate in bacteriophage t <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, both hcp and vgrg appear to be structural and secreted components. thus, the detection of both proteins in culture supernatants has become an indicator of t6ss functionality  <cit> . some vgrg proteins known as "evolved vgrgs" present a c-terminal extension including "effector domains" that have been linked to a variety of functions, such as crosslinking of host actin, degradation of the peptidoglycan layer, and adp-ribosylation of host proteins  <cit> . the evolved vgrgs have been identified in a limited number of bacteria and are usually encoded outside t6ss loci, scattered throughout the genome.

following the initial characterization of iahp clusters  <cit> , several in silico analyses have identified t6ss loci in bacterial genome sequences available. in  <dig>  a screen for homologs to the conserved t6ss components vipa/igla and vipb/iglb identified  <dig> t6ss loci in  <dig> bacteria  <cit> . later that year, a similarity search for orthologs of t6ss components described in vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia mallei identified t6ss loci in  <dig> bacterial species  <cit> . even though both analyses greatly expanded the number of t6ss loci reported, they were based on the detection of homologs to t6ss components present in only three organisms, overlooking the existence of phylogenetically distant t6ss loci. a more recent study addressed this limitation by analyzing the presence of conserved protein domains rather than orthologous proteins, to identify  <dig> t6ss loci from  <dig> different bacteria  <cit> .

the first report for a t6ss in salmonella corresponds to the genetic characterization of the salmonella pathogenicity island  <dig> , formerly known as sci , which is adjacent to the trna-encoding gene aspv  <cit> . spi- <dig> is a ~ <dig> kb genomic island presenting a mosaic structure characterized by the presence of the saf and tcf fimbrial operons. analysis of the region upstream of the fimbrial operons revealed numerous orfs encoding putative periplasmic, outer membrane and secreted proteins, suggesting that spi- <dig> encoded a novel secretion system  <cit> . after the classification of spi- <dig> as an iahp locus  <cit>  and the discovery of t6sss in v. cholerae and p. aeruginosa  <cit>  it was clear that spi- <dig> encoded a t6ss, although there is no experimental evidence on the functionality of this system. conflicting reports associate spi- <dig> t6ss with salmonella pathogenesis. a s. typhimurium mutant in stm <dig>  presented an increased intracellular growth in macrophages and was hypervirulent in balb/c mice  <cit> . on the other hand, mutations in stm <dig>  and stm <dig>  have been reported to cause a ~30% reduction in the ability of s. typhimurium to replicate in macrophages  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of a dominant negative version of stm <dig> impaired the ability of s. typhimurium to invade epithelial cells  <cit> .

despite the recent advances in our understanding of the structural and genomic organization of t6ss gene clusters, every in silico analysis performed so far to identify these loci in bacteria has taken into account a limited number of the currently available salmonella genome sequences. considering that many bacterial species harbor multiple t6ss in their genomes, it is plausible to think that there could be more than one t6ss in the genus salmonella in addition to spi- <dig> t6ss waiting to be uncovered. in the present work we performed a genome-wide in silico analysis of all currently available salmonella genome sequences to identify t6ss loci. our analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> novel t6ss gene clusters encoded in differentially-distributed genomic islands presenting distinctive evolutionary histories.

RESULTS
identification of t6ss gene clusters in salmonella
representatives of the  <dig> t6ss core components recently defined by boyer and coworkers  <cit>  were used as baits to identify t6ss loci by sequential blastn, blastp and tblastx searches using all publicly available sequences from  <dig> salmonella genome sequencing projects . the data analyzed included both chromosome and plasmid sequences covering  <dig> different serotypes of salmonella enterica  .

to maximize the power of the screen, representatives of each core component from  <dig> different organisms belonging to each of the different branches in phylogenetic trees previously defined for t6ss loci  <cit>  were used as baits. the analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> novel t6ss loci in addition to the gene cluster encoded within spi- <dig> . the novel t6ss gene clusters are located in  <dig> genomic islands we have designated spi- <dig>  spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  respectively. these islands are differentially distributed among the salmonella serotypes analyzed and contain each of the  <dig> t6ss core components described to date . most salmonella present a unique t6ss encoded either by spi- <dig> or spi- <dig>  on the other hand, a limited number of salmonella carry two t6ss, encoded either by spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> or by spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  finally, no t6ss locus was identified in the available genomes of s. enterica subspecies enterica  serotypes paratyphi b, virchow and javiana, and s. enterica subspecies diarizonae  serotype 61: <dig> v: <dig> ,.

 <cit> 
a spi- <dig> in strain sara <dig> presents an internal deletion of ~ <dig> kb. in contrast, strain sara <dig> harbors a full version of the island.

b spi- <dig> in serotype enteritidis presents an internal deletion of ~ <dig> kb.

spi-19: a second t6ss gene cluster in s. enterica subspecies enterica 
spi- <dig> is a novel t6ss locus present in a subset of serotypes belonging to s. enterica subspecies enterica , including dublin, weltevreden, agona, gallinarum and enteritidis. remarkably, serotypes dublin and weltevreden also carry the t6ss encoded in spi- <dig>  while serotype enteritidis only presents a truncated version of spi- <dig> . the orfs, product sizes, conserved protein domains and genome coordinates of spi- <dig> genes in serotypes dublin, weltevreden, agona, gallinarum and enteritidis are detailed in additional file  <dig> 

the island corresponds to a ~ <dig> kb element located in the vicinity of a gene cluster encoding putative proteins involved in sugar transport and utilization , and is not directly linked to a trna-encoding gene . although the average g+c content of the island is similar to that of the whole genome , the nucleotide content is not evenly distributed. for instance, regions of spi- <dig> in serotype gallinarum encoding hcp-like proteins and proteins of unknown function presents a low g+c content , while the rest of the island presents a g+c content significantly higher .

spi- <dig> encodes ~ <dig> orfs, including each t6ss core component . notably, the island includes two orfs encoding hcp-like proteins that only share 27% of sequence identity . we refer to these proteins as hcp- <dig> and hcp- <dig>  respectively . hcp- <dig> is encoded in a putative operon that includes most of the t6ss functions. on the other hand, hcp- <dig> is encoded upstream of a vgrg homolog at the opposite end of the island. this vgrg protein does not present a c-terminal extension or a putative effector domain. additionally, the island includes  <dig> distantly related impa homologs , as reported for other t6ss loci  <cit> . spi- <dig> does not encode transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators present in others t6ss gene clusters  <cit> , but encodes a protein containing the forkhead-associated  domain. it is known that an fha-domain containing protein interacts with a ser/thr kinase  and a phosphatase  to regulate type vi secretion in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . although spi- <dig> does not encode kinases and phosphatases, the possible interaction of the fha-domain containing protein with other kinases and phosphatases to regulate secretion by this t6ss cannot be ruled out. in addition to t6ss-related components, a small "sel1-like repeat protein" was identified in spi- <dig> . serotypes agona and weltevreden encode a full version of the protein , while serotypes enteritidis, gallinarum and dublin encode different truncated forms of it . notably, seag_b <dig> and sew_a <dig> share ~31–38% sequence identity with several secreted sel1-like proteins of l. pneumophila involved in manipulation of vacuolar trafficking in macrophages  <cit> .

the genetic architecture of spi- <dig> is highly conserved in serotypes dublin, weltevreden, agona and gallinarum. the main structural differences observed are circumscribed to the right end of the island, a region encoding a variable number of proteins with unknown function flanked by rhs elements . gene content variability in this region can be explained by deletions and rearrangements involving recombination events between rhs elements. in serotype gallinarum we identified a small orf downstream of sg <dig> that is absent in the genome annotation. this orf encodes a gp25-like protein homolog to the t6ss-related orf vca <dig> in v. cholerae , and is annotated in the genome of the other spi- <dig> positive serotypes.

in serotype agona, the cluster of genes related to sugar metabolism flanking the left end of spi- <dig> is missing. the absence of these genes has been reported previously  <cit> . the existence of  <dig> orfs  encoding transposase remnants at this junction may be related to the absence of these genes. in addition, spi- <dig> in serotype agona includes a third impa homolog  adjacent to a truncated second copy of icmf . probably, these orfs were generated by a duplication of neighboring genes encoding complete versions of both impa and icmf proteins .

in serotype enteritidis, spi- <dig> presents an internal deletion of ~ <dig> kb with respect to the island in serotypes dublin, weltevreden, agona and gallinarum . as the result of this deletion, the island in enteritidis only encodes  <dig> orfs,  <dig> of which correspond to t6ss core components: sen <dig> , sen <dig>  and sen <dig> . the absence of essential components suggests that the t6ss encoded in this serotype is not functional. interestingly, the internal region of spi- <dig> absent in enteritidis has been defined as the "region of difference 9"  in a comparative genome analysis of serotypes gallinarum and enteritidis  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that the presence of an active t6ss is somehow related to differences in host adaptation presented by these serotypes.

as mentioned before, spi- <dig> is not obviously linked to a trna-encoding gene. comparative genomic analyses revealed that spi- <dig> is located at the left junction of a large chromosomal region  inverted with respect to the genome of serotype typhimurium  <cit> . the right end of the inverted region is flanked by a functional copy of the trna-encoding gene serx. a more detailed sequence analysis revealed the presence of a  <dig> bp-long scar located at the left border of spi- <dig> in the genomes of serotypes dublin, weltevreden, gallinarum and enteritidis. in serotype agona, the last  <dig> nucleotides of the scar are lost. notably, in each case the scar includes  <dig> nt in the 3' end of serx. thus, a truncated version of serx is flanking the left end of spi- <dig>  these observations suggest that spi- <dig> was originally inserted at the 3' end of serx, being flanked by a truncated and a functional copy of this trna-encoding gene. a posterior inversion event repositioned the functional copy of serx to a location distant from spi- <dig> in the genome of serotypes dublin, weltevreden, agona, gallinarum and enteritidis. it has been reported that insertions of new horizontally acquired genetic material could trigger compensating genomic rearrangements in order to maintain genome stability  <cit> . thus, the acquisition of spi- <dig> could be one of the events leading to the observed inversion. these events must have occurred after the divergence of serotype typhimurium and a common ancestor of serotypes encoding spi- <dig> 

subspecies arizonae  encodes two novel t6ss gene clusters
besides spi- <dig> t6ss and spi- <dig>  two additional t6ss loci were identified in salmonella. the novel gene clusters, now designated spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  are present only in the genome of s. enterica subspecies arizonae  serotype 62:z <dig> z23:-. notably, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> are not encoded in the genome of this serotype.

spi- <dig> corresponds to a ~ <dig> kb genomic island encoding  <dig> orfs  with an average g+c content of  <dig> %. seventeen orfs related to t6ss function were identified,  <dig> of which correspond to core components . among the t6ss-related components, the island encodes an hcp-like protein  and a vgrg protein with no c-terminal extension . in addition,  <dig> impa homologs were identified: sari_ <dig>  sari_ <dig> and sari_ <dig> . sequence analyses revealed that sari_ <dig> and sari_ <dig> encode truncated proteins corresponding to the c-terminal and n-terminal of an impa homolog, respectively. most probably, both orfs were generated as the result of a point mutation that introduced a stop codon in sari_ <dig>  on the other hand, sari_ <dig> encodes an impa homolog distantly related to sari_02719/sari_ <dig>  spi- <dig> encodes neither transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulators nor fha-domain containing proteins present in other t6ss loci  <cit> . as in the case of spi- <dig>  the g+c content of spi- <dig> is not uniformly distributed. while most of the island has a g+c content of 55–60%, regions with low g+c content  encoding proteins with unknown function were detected. although spi- <dig> is located in the proximity of the trna-encoding gene aspv , the island is not flanked by obvious direct repeats. interestingly, aspv corresponds to the insertion site of spi- <dig> in many serotypes of s. enterica, indicating that different t6ss have been acquired at the same genomic location during salmonella evolution.

spi- <dig> is a second island encoding a t6ss in the genome of serotype iiia 62:z <dig> z23:-. this island has an extension of ~ <dig> kb and is delimited by transposase remnants . again, the average g+c content of the island  is unevenly distributed, presenting regions with low g+c content  encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function and regions with higher g+c content  encoding t6ss-related orfs. spi- <dig> is flanked by  <dig> horizontally acquired genetic elements . adjacent to its right junction, a cryptic lambdoid phage  is inserted at the 3' end of thrw. this trna-encoding gene corresponds to the insertion site of p <dig> and related phages in salmonella  <cit> . in addition, a small genomic island encoding  <dig> orfs  was found in the vicinity of the left junction of spi- <dig>  five of these orfs share extensive homology to orfs in spi- <dig> , initially described as a locus encoding genes required for full virulence of serotype gallinarum in chickens  <cit> .

spi- <dig> includes  <dig> orfs ,  <dig> of which encode t6ss-related components . among the orfs not linked to t6ss, a putative chitinase  and a protein  containing the pasta  domain  <cit>  were identified. notably, spi- <dig> presents additional orfs linked to t6ss besides the core components shared with spi- <dig>  hence, the island encodes not one but two vgrg proteins without c-terminal extension . in addition, spi- <dig> encodes an evolved vgrg protein  containing a c-terminal extension that presents two conserved domains: cog <dig>  and pf <dig>  . this constitutes one of the main findings of the present study as this is not only the first evolved vgrg described in salmonella, but also the first evolved vgrg including a pyocin domain described so far in the literature. the c-terminal extension in sari_ <dig> shares extensive sequence identity with the uropathogenic specific protein , a putative s-type pyocin encoded by upec strains  <cit>  . s-type pyocins are protease-sensitive, colicin-like bacteriocins produced by p. aeruginosa strains. these bacteriocins are normally constituted by two proteins: a large component that carries the killing activity and a small component that serves as an immunity protein  <cit> . noteworthy, spi- <dig> includes  <dig> orfs encoding putative colicin/pyocin immunity proteins , one of which is encoded just downstream of sari_ <dig> . altogether, the presence of putative bacteriocin immunity proteins and an evolved vgrg with potential bacteriocin activity in spi- <dig> suggests for the first time that bacteria could use a t6ss to kill other bacteria.

the spi- <dig> t6ss gene cluster is widely distributed in salmonella enterica
as mentioned before, the only t6ss identified to date in salmonella is located in spi- <dig>  a pathogenicity island that also encodes the saf and tcf fimbrial systems  <cit> . the presence of the t6ss associated to spi- <dig> was confirmed in  <dig> of the genomes surveyed, all of them belonging to s. enterica subspecies enterica . this group includes serotypes typhimurium, typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi c, kentucky, newport, heidelberg, saintpaul, schwarzengrund, tennessee, hadar, infantis, choleraesuis, weltevreden, dublin and i  <dig>   <cit> , 12:i:- . the orfs, product sizes, conserved protein domains and genome coordinates of spi- <dig> t6ss genes in representative strains of the mentioned serotypes are detailed in additional file  <dig>  furthermore, the presence of the saf fimbrial operon was also detected in each of these serotypes, and the additional presence of the tcf fimbrial operon was confirmed in serotypes paratyphi a, choleraesuis and typhi. this indicates that the  <dig> serotypes encoding the t6ss within spi- <dig> harbor a complete version of this pathogenicity island.

depending on the serotype, spi- <dig> t6ss corresponds to a region of ~ <dig> to  <dig> kb that encodes ~ <dig> to  <dig> orfs, including each of the  <dig> t6ss core components . noteworthy, critical t6ss components in many spi- <dig> t6ss are encoded by pseudogenes, as the case of scii  in serotype typhi, and scig  in serotypes i  <dig>  <cit> ,12:i:- and choleraesuis . this observation suggests that these t6ss are not functional.

the genetic architecture of spi- <dig> t6ss is highly conserved among serotypes . however, structural differences limited to  <dig> particular regions in the island were observed. the first region is located downstream of scii , and encodes a variable number of proteins with no known function and embedded hcp-like proteins. the obvious consequence of such variability is the presence of either one or two copies of hcp-like proteins in different serotypes. the second region is located downstream of scis  and encodes a variable number of proteins with unknown function. the third region is located downstream of vrgs  and encodes a variable number of rhs elements. in contrast to spi- <dig>  the variability observed in this region is not explained by deletions involving recombination between rhs elements. more likely, different serotypes have acquired a distinct repertoire of unrelated rhs-like elements.

differences in the genetic structure of spi- <dig> t6ss among strains of the same serotype were only detected in the case of s. saintpaul. in this serotype, strain sara <dig> presents a ~ <dig> kb deletion in spi- <dig> with respect to strain sara <dig> . as the result of this deletion, spi- <dig> t6ss in sara <dig> does not encode critical components such as scis , scii  and the two hcp-like proteins, suggesting that the only t6ss encoded in this strain is not functional.

the analysis also revealed that spi- <dig> in serotypes enteritidis, gallinarum, agona, paratyphi b and virchow does not encode a t6ss , but maintain the saf fimbrial operon. furthermore, spi- <dig> in serotype javiana neither encodes a t6ss nor a fimbrial operon. these observations support the notion that the t6ss and the associated fimbrial operons saf and tcf have been acquired independently during the evolution of salmonella to produce a complex spi- <dig>  a more detailed sequence analysis revealed that spi- <dig> in serotype javiana only includes  <dig> orfs, one of which corresponds to an impa-like protein associated to the spi- <dig> t6ss. several additional remnants of t6ss-related orfs associated with spi- <dig> were identified in serotypes enteritidis, gallinarum, agona, paratyphi b and virchow . the presence of these remnant orfs suggests that an ancestor of spi- <dig> t6ss was originally present in the genome of these serotypes, and was subsequently lost during evolution. in addition, a remnant of the first orf in spi- <dig>  was identified within spi- <dig> in serotypes gallinarum, paratyphi b and virchow , suggesting that an ancestor of spi- <dig> may have been present at this location. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the insertion site for both spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> in salmonella corresponds to the same trna-encoding gene, aspv.

organization of genes encoding core components in t6ss loci
boyer and coworkers identified three groups of t6ss core components presenting a conserved genomic organization  <cit> . these conserved "modules" were defined by computing the number of loci in which every pair of t6ss core components  could be co-transcribed. the first module includes cog <dig> , cog <dig>  cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . the second module includes cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig> . the third module includes cog <dig> , cog <dig>  and cog <dig>  <cit> . when we analyzed the conservation of these modules for each t6ss locus in salmonella, important differences were identified:

• in the first module, components cog <dig>  cog <dig> and cog <dig> are linked in spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  while cog <dig> is disconnected. in contrast, only cog <dig> and cog <dig> are linked in spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  while both cog <dig> and cog <dig> are disconnected. furthermore, spi- <dig> includes a second copy of cog <dig> that is also unlinked to the proposed module.

• in the second module, cog <dig> and cog <dig> are linked in the  <dig> salmonella t6ss loci, while cog <dig>  is not linked to either cog <dig> or cog <dig>  in addition, both spi- <dig> t6ss and spi- <dig> encodes two hcp proteins in different regions of each t6ss locus. furthermore, in spi- <dig> one of these orfs  is located adjacent to cog <dig>  but in a divergent orientation, clearly indicating that cog3516/cog <dig> and hcp have evolved independently. this is consistent with the report of hcp proteins involved in t6ss function that are encoded outside the t6ss locus in v. cholerae  <cit> , and also to the presence of "orphan hcps" apparently unlinked to the t6ss function in salmonella and other bacteria .

• finally, a conserved third module is present in spi- <dig> t6ss and spi- <dig>  on the other hand, while cog <dig> and cog <dig> are linked in spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  cog <dig> is disconnected from the module. furthermore, spi- <dig> includes  <dig> additional copies of cog <dig> that are also disconnected from the module, and one from each other.

the similarities detected between modules in spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> indicate a close phylogenetic relationship, while differences between modules in spi- <dig> t6ss, spi- <dig> and spi20/spi- <dig> suggest that these loci have been acquired through independent horizontal transfer events, or have evolved independently to perform specialized functions.

comparative analysis of salmonella t6ss gene clusters
a basic comparative analysis of the salmonella t6ss loci described in this study revealed that they share very limited homology one to each other at the dna level . this result supports the notion that these genomic islands were acquired by independent horizontal gene transfer events during salmonella evolution. to identify evolutionary relationships between these t6ss gene clusters, we followed the approach used by bingle and coworkers to study phylogeny between t6ss loci  <cit> . the concatenated aminoacidic sequences of conserved components vipa and vipb from  <dig> t6ss loci  were analyzed.

notably, the t6ss loci in salmonella differentially clustered in the mayor phylogenetic groups described for t6ss gene clusters  <cit>  . thus, every spi- <dig> t6ss locus included in our analysis belongs to group a, also including the t6ss gene clusters h16_a0645-h16_a <dig> in ralstonia eutropha strain h <dig> and tss- <dig> in burkholderia pseudomallei strain 1106a. this result agrees with previous reports on the evolutionary relationship between spi- <dig> t6ss in typhimurium and tss- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> belong to group c, which includes the t6ss cluster within pai-metv in the uropathogenic e. coli  strain cft <dig>  finally, each spi- <dig> analyzed belongs to group d, also including the t6ss cluster within oi# <dig> in e. coli o157:h <dig> strain sakai, and the agi- <dig> island in the avian pathogenic e. coli  strain o <dig> . according to the nomenclature established in a recent phylogenetic analysis performed by boyer and coworkers  <cit> , spi- <dig> t6ss, spi- <dig> and spi-20/spi- <dig> belong to sub-groups iii, i and ii, respectively.

in a second analysis, we determined identity at the protein level of each salmonella t6ss gene cluster, as a whole, to the closest phylogenetic relatives identified by our previous analysis. notably, spi- <dig> t6ss presented extensive identity and shared a similar genetic architecture with t6ss gene clusters tss- <dig> in b. pseudomallei and h16_a0645-h16_a <dig> in r. eutropha . the same was true for spi- <dig> and the whole t6ss gene cluster within oi# <dig> in ehec and the agi- <dig> island in apec . on the other hand, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> present several differences with its relative t6ss within pai-metv in upec . thus, although spi- <dig> conserves the overall genetic architecture of the t6ss locus in upec, the island includes several additional orfs encoding proteins of unknown function . in addition, spi- <dig> presents a genetic architecture similar to spi- <dig> and to the t6ss gene cluster in pai-metv. nevertheless, the island includes additional embedded orfs encoding multiple copies of vgrg and gp25-like proteins, putative transposases, a putative chitinase and colicin/pyocin immunity proteins . in spite of this, the phylogenetic proximity of spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> is evident.

the results obtained from both phylogenetic analyses reached the same conclusions, validating the evaluation of divergence in the aminoacidic sequence of vipa and vipb homologs to determine phylogenetic relationships between different t6ss loci. altogether, these results strongly suggest that spi- <dig> t6ss, spi- <dig> and spi-20/spi- <dig> were acquired by independent horizontal transfer events from several unrelated bacterial species during the evolution of salmonella. this is supported by the following observations:  each cluster is encoded in or corresponds to a genomic island that includes every t6ss core component,  spi- <dig> t6ss and spi- <dig> are located adjacent to the trna-encoding gene aspv, a known hot-spot for insertion of genetic elements by horizontal transfer,  spi- <dig> is linked to a large chromosomal inversion, presumably caused by its insertion in the trna-encoding gene serx, and  spi- <dig> t6ss, spi- <dig> and spi-20/spi- <dig> belong to different t6ss phylogenetic groups . finally, the similar genetic organization presented by spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> , the presence of conserved regions sharing extensive sequence identity at the protein level , and the fact that they belong to the same t6ss phylogenetic group  support a common origin for these t6ss loci. thus, the presence of spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> in the genome of s. iiia serotype 62:z <dig> z23:- can be explained either as the result of the acquisition of one of these clusters by lateral transfer and a posterior duplication event, or by sequential lateral transfer of each island from closely related donor organisms.

we can hypothesize evolutionary origins for each t6ss locus in salmonella considering both phylogenetic analyses performed. thus, spi- <dig> t6ss may have been acquired from a beta-proteobacteria in the burkholderiaceae family, related to burkholderia pseudomallei and ralstonia eutropha . in contrast, spi- <dig> seems to have been acquired from a pathogenic e. coli strain related to ehec and apec. finally, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> may have been acquired from a upec strain. in any case, each t6ss locus seems to have further evolved independently to generate systems performing specialized functions.

orphan hcp-like proteins in salmonella
several orfs encoding additional hcp-like proteins in salmonella were identified in this study . because these proteins are not directly linked to t6ss gene clusters, we referred to them as "orphan hcp-like proteins". according to their distribution, these proteins can be attributed to three major groups:  those present in every s. enterica serotype analyzed ,  an unique representative present only in serotypes agona, paratyphi a, kentucky and typhi , and  those present only in s. iiia serotype 62:z <dig> z23:- . the genomic location and distinctive features of each of these proteins are detailed in additional file  <dig> 

homologs of stm <dig> s and stm <dig> are widely distributed among s. enterica serotypes. noteworthy, stm <dig> s corresponds to hile, a  <dig> aa protein that negatively regulates the expression of hila, which encodes the master regulator controlling the expression of spi- <dig> t3ss in salmonella  <cit> . folkesson and coworkers were the first to identify a similarity between hile and hcp proteins encoded in spi- <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, stm <dig> corresponds to a  <dig> aa protein with no known function encoded in spi- <dig>  a locus including genes required for full virulence of serotypes enteritidis, gallinarum and typhimurium in different animal hosts  <cit> . the genes encoding stm <dig> and stm <dig> constitute a small operon predicted to be part of the pmrab regulon  <cit> . remarkably, stm <dig> belongs to a family of proteins including the baseplate gp <dig> protein in phage t <dig> and relatives of a conserved t6ss core component  <cit> .

as mentioned, an orphan hcp-like protein present only in serotypes kentucky, paratyphi a, agona and typhi was also identified. depending on the serotype, this orphan hcp corresponds to a protein of either  <dig> or  <dig> aa. in all cases, this small orf is encoded in spi- <dig> and is located downstream of an integrase remnant in the vicinity of the trna-encoding gene phev. finally, s. iiia 62:z <dig> z23:- harbors four additional orphan hcp-like proteins, each of them placed adjacent to transposase remnants or regions acquired by lateral gene transfer. notably, sari_ <dig> corresponds to an unusually long hcp-like protein  containing the hcp/cog <dig> domain at the n-terminus  and a c-terminal extension  including no conserved protein domain.

there are reports of other unusually long hcp proteins carrying c-terminal extensions due to acquisition of novel protein domains. this is the case of usp, a putative bacteriocin related to s-type pyocins containing an hcp domain at the n-terminus  <cit> . to date, there is no experimental evidence confirming the putative bactericidal activity of usp or explaining the role played by the hcp domain in its function. however, the usp gene has been widely used as a virulence marker in upec strains  <cit> . another example corresponds to the hypothetical protein yhhz of e. coli. this protein also contains an hcp domain at the n-terminus and a degenerate hnh domain at the c-terminus. the yhhz gene has been reported to be induced during growth of e. coli in biofilms  <cit> . the structural features presented by these long hcp proteins  resemble those presented by the evolved vgrg proteins. because of this similitude, we propose to designate these proteins as "evolved hcps". apparently, both usp and yhhz correspond to evolved hcps not linked to t6ss function and seem to serve different roles for the bacterial cell. this could also be the case for sari_ <dig> in s. iiia 62:z <dig> z23:-.

in order to identify evolutionary relationships between these orphan hcp-like proteins and those directly linked to t6ss loci, the sequence divergence among these proteins was analyzed. as a reference,  <dig> hcp proteins described in p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig>  and  <dig> described in v. cholerae strain v <dig>  were included in the analysis. the results revealed the presence of  <dig> groups of hcp relatives . group a includes pa <dig> and every hcp protein encoded in spi- <dig> t6ss. group b includes pa <dig> and every stm <dig> homolog. group c includes only hile homologs, and group d includes pa <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig>  vca_ <dig>  vc_ <dig>  hcp proteins in spi- <dig>  spi- <dig>  spi- <dig>  and the orphan hcp-like proteins in s. iiia 62:z <dig> z23:- .

although evolutionary relationships between hcp-like proteins were determined, the analysis failed to predict a role for many of them in t6ss function. we believe that this reflects the fact that the hcp domain is linked to a particular folding pattern or structure rather than to a specific function or activity. altogether, our data support the notion that sari_ <dig> and hile homologs arose from a common ancestor of every hcp protein and further evolved to gain new functions, while keeping structural properties of its relatives directly linked to t6ss function.

CONCLUSIONS
this study expands the current knowledge on bacterial type vi secretion by the identification and description of  <dig> novel t6ss loci in salmonella. we have determined that each t6ss locus has a distinct evolutionary history, indicating acquisition through independent horizontal gene transfer events. interestingly, while some serotypes harbor multiple t6ss loci others do not encode for any. this observation indicates that t6ss function is not essential for virulence but may provide an additional advantage in certain environments. on the other hand, the presence of  <dig> t6ss in many serotypes perhaps reflects specific roles for each of them in different steps during infection or in different environments or hosts. our analysis also identified an evolved vgrg protein that contains a c-terminal extension sharing identity to s-type pyocins. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a vgrg protein carrying a bacteriocin effector domain and suggests a novel role for t6ss in bacterial killing. the functionality of the  <dig> t6ss described here and their roles in salmonella pathogenesis and host-specificity are currently under study in our laboratory.
