BACKGROUND
diabetes mellitus is a major independent risk factor for stroke occurrence; patients with type  <dig> diabetes have twice the risk of stroke compared to the general population  <cit>  and are at markedly increased risk of death due to cerebrovascular disease  <cit> . the precise mechanism for diabetes-induced cerebral and vascular damage may involve a causal relationship between hyperglycemia-evoked oxidative stress and inflammation . type  <dig> diabetes can cause oxidative stress, leading to vascular complications and stroke . acute hemispheric stroke may, in turn, result in urinary incontinence. bladder dysfunction has been reported in patients suffering from stroke  <cit> . additionally, rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion , which disrupts the cholinergic pathway between the frontal cortex and the nucleus basalis  <cit> , show increased voiding frequency, inefficient voiding  <cit> , and decreased bladder capacity  <cit> . treating mcao injury by intracerebrovascular administration of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases bladder capacity  <cit> .

glucagon-like peptide- <dig>  is a gut hormone secreted by the small intestine that exerts a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin release by binding to glp- <dig> receptors  on pancreatic β-cells  <cit> . glp- <dig> also stimulates β-cell proliferation  <cit>  and enhances β-cell differentiation  <cit> . glp- <dig> and its longer-acting analogs exendin- <dig>  and liraglutide  protect a variety of cell types against oxidative injury and are widely used in therapeutic contexts. these agents exert protective effects in experimental models of dilated cardiomyopathy, arteriovenous failure  <cit> , myocardial infarction  <cit> , and global stroke  <cit> . glp-1rs are highly expressed throughout the brain  <cit> , and glp- <dig> and glp-1r agonists such as ex- <dig> completely protect against glutamate–induced neuronal death  <cit>  and stroke injury  <cit> . ex- <dig> has been shown to attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury  <cit>  and prevent lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in murine pancreatic β-cells through activation of akt and inhibition of the mitochondrial pathway  <cit> . ex- <dig> also reduces damage to vascular endothelial cells by high levels of glucose and tumor necrosis factor-α by inhibiting p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase expression and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa b   <cit> . lir protects against oxidative stress and diabetic nephropathy via a pka-mediated inhibition of renal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate  oxidase  <cit> .

given the prevalence of stroke in diabetic patients, therapeutic strategies for reducing stroke-induced motor and cognition deficits and bladder dysfunction in these patients after acute stroke are of interest. based on the previously established protective effects of glp- <dig> analogs against oxidative stress and cell death, we investigated the effects of ex- <dig> and lir on cerebral microcirculation, oxidative stress-related protein expression, cognitive and motor behaviors, and parasympathetic nerve-mediated micturition function after mcao in the db/db mouse model of diabetes.

RESULTS
ex- <dig> and lir partially alleviate mcao-induced reductions in cerebral microcirculation
figure  <dig> shows changes in cerebral microcirculation in the right hemisphere of db/db mice following mcao injury. cerebral microcirculation was significantly reduced throughout the 12 h following mcao compared to that in the control group . within 6–12 h after mcao, mice treated with ex- <dig> or lir showed significantly increased microcirculation compared to the mcao group. there was no significant difference in the percentage change in perfusion units  between mice treated with ex- <dig> and lir. brain edema was not observed via t-2-weighted mri in control group. marked forebrain edema in the section area 12 h after mcao group was significantly increased in the mcao group compared to that in the control group . between mice treated with ex- <dig> or lir significantly decreased edema area compared to mcao group .fig.  <dig> effects of exendin- <dig> and liraglutide on cerebral microcirculation after injury in db/db mice. a schematic diagram showing the area of microcirculation measurement. b representative full field laser perfusion images showing cerebral microcirculation in mice treated with exendin- <dig>  or liraglutide  following middle cerebral artery occlusion  injury. percentage change in perfusion units , presented as mean ± standard error of the mean . groups were compared using two-way analysis of variance  with a post hoc bonferroni adjustment for pairwise comparisons. *p <  <dig>  compared to the mcao group. c the t2-weight magnetic resonance imaging series revealed that after mcao 12 h group marked brain edema  had a significantly higher percentage in the red line section area d in comparison with control group. e after exendin- <dig> and liraglutide treatment decrease the brain edema percentage more significantly than the group of mcao. *p <  <dig>  compared to the control group, a

ex- <dig> reduces mcao-induced expression of oxidative stress and apoptosis markers
as shown in fig.  <dig>  mcao markedly increased staining for the ros marker dihydroethidium  and the inflammatory marker intercellular adhesion molecule- <dig>  in the right brainstem of db/db mice. mice subjected to mcao also showed increased caspase  <dig> expression and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling , which are markers of apoptosis. staining for dhe, icam- <dig>  caspase  <dig> and tunel was greater at 12 h than at  <dig> or 6 h after mcao. these mcao-induced increases in oxidative stress and apoptotic markers were markedly decreased by ex- <dig> treatment .fig.  <dig> effects of exendin- <dig> on mcao-induced markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. shown are dihydroethidium  labeling of reactive oxygen species , intercellular adhesion molecule- <dig> , dhe and icam- <dig> merged  caspase  <dig>  and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling  at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h after mcao injury in db/db mice. mcao markedly increased dhe, icam- <dig>  caspase  <dig> and tunel labeling; these effects were offset by ex- <dig> treatment 



mcao also significantly increased the levels of brain dhe labeling , blood and brain reactive oxygen species  , and brain malondialdehyde  , a by-product of lipid peroxidation that indicates oxidative stress. levels of these markers were higher at 12 h than at  <dig> or 6 h after injury in the mcao group but were significantly reduced by ex- <dig> and lir treatments . ex- <dig> and lir displayed similar effects in reducing brain and blood markers of oxidative stress.fig.  <dig> effects of exendin- <dig> and liraglutide on mcao-induced ros production. shown are dhe , blood ros , brain ros  and brain malondialdehyde  content  at  <dig>   <dig>  and 12 h after mcao injury in db/db mice. mcao significantly increased dhe expression, blood and brain ros levels, and brain mda content, whereas exendin  and lir partially occluded these effects. data are presented as mean ± sem . groups were compared using two-way anova with a post hoc bonferroni adjustment for pairwise comparisons. *p <  <dig>  compared to controls; a

ex- <dig> and lir inhibit mcao-induced inflammatory protein expression
expression of the inflammation-related proteins icam- <dig>  nf-κb p <dig>  and nf-κb p <dig> in db/db mice following mcao, as measured by western blotting  <cit> , is shown in fig.  <dig>  icam- <dig> expression was significantly higher greater at 12 h than at 3 h after mcao and than in controls; this increase was significantly suppressed by ex- <dig> and lir treatments. ex- <dig> decreased icam- <dig> expression to a slightly greater extent than did lir, although this difference was not significant. nf-κb p <dig> and p <dig> expression in the right hemisphere of cortical homogenate was significantly increased  <dig> and 12 h after mcao compared to controls . ex- <dig> and lir exerted similar effects on mcao-induced increases in cortical nf-κb p <dig> and p <dig> expression. these increases were significantly inhibited 12 h after mcao by ex- <dig> and lir treatments. as shown in fig. 4e, the green nf-κb fluorescence was greatly increased in the section of cerebral cortical area 12 h after mcao in comparison with the matched-time control mice. the enhanced nf-κb fluorescence was effectively depressed in the lir- or ex-4-treatment group 12 h after mcao. according to cortical cellular morphology, nf-κb fluorescence seems to be expressed in both neuronal and glial cells 12 h after mcao.fig.  <dig> effects of exendin- <dig> and liraglutide on mcao-induced inflammatory protein expression. a typical western blots of nuclear factor-κb  p <dig>  and icam- <dig> in cortical extracts at  <dig>   <dig>  or 12 h after mcao. densitometry of b nf-κb <dig>  c icam- <dig>  and d nf-κb p <dig> bands normalized to β-actin. data are presented as mean ± sem . e the expression of nf-κb  was markedly enhanced in the cerebral cortical area 12 h after mcao in comparison with the matched-time control mice. the increased nf-κb fluorescence was efficiently attenuated in the lir- or ex-4-treatment group 12 h after mcao. the nf-κb fluorescence seems to be expressed in both neuronal and glial cells 12 h after mcao . groups were compared using two-way anova with a post hoc bonferroni adjustment for pairwise comparisons. *p <  <dig>  compared to controls; a

ex- <dig> and lir treatments attenuate mcao-induced decreases in manganese superoxide dismutase expression
the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase  was significantly reduced at  <dig> or 12 h after mcao injury when compared to control mice ; this effect was significantly attenuated at 12 h after mcao by lir and ex- <dig> treatment . although ex- <dig> resulted in a larger increase in mnsod expression than did lir, this difference was not significant.

ex- <dig> and lir enhance levels of phosphorylated akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the brain
figure 5f shows representative western blots of phosphorylated akt  and endothelial nitric oxide synthase  in the cortex of db/db mice after mcao. although neither p-akt  nor p-enos  expression was affected by mcao, the expression of both proteins was significantly increased in mice treated with ex- <dig> or lir 12 h after mcao . the expression of p-akt and p-enos was similar in ex-4- and lir-treated animals.

ex- <dig> treatment ameliorates mcao-induced motor and cognitive deficits
the effects of mcao on motor and cognitive function were evaluated using a sniffing behavior paradigm. mcao caused motor deficits, as shown by significant decreases in the average center velocity  and elongation ratio  at 12 h, 3 days, or 7 days after mcao injury when compared to the time-match of control group . ex- <dig> treatment significantly ameliorated these mcao-induced motor deficits at each time point. further, the mcao-induced increase in center velocity  and elongation ratio were significantly improved by ex- <dig> at 7 days after mcao compared to 12 h after mcao  .fig.  <dig> effects of exendin- <dig> on mcao-induced motor and cognitive deficits in db/db mice at 12 h ,  <dig> and 7 days  after mcao. a, a1–a <dig> experimental design and representative activity traces of control, b, b1–b <dig> mcao-injured, and c, c1–c <dig> mcao-injured mice treated with ex- <dig> at 12 h, 3 days, and 7 days after injury. motor parameters were  velocity calculated using the body center trace and  elongation ratio; cognitive parameters were  non-target and  target sniffing bousts. groups were compared using two-way anova with a post hoc bonferroni adjustment for pairwise comparisons. *p <  <dig>  compared to the time-matched control group; a

cognitive function was also significantly impaired by mcao , as indicated by an increased percentage of non-target sniff time  and decreased percentage of target sniff time  at 12 h, 3 days, and 7 days after mcao injury. ex- <dig> treatment partially attenuated this cognition deficit, as the times spent investigating the non-target and target objects were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, at  <dig> and 7 days after mcao in ex-4-treated mice. we further found that the time spent exploring the target object was significantly increased at 7 days after mcao compared to 12 h after mcao in ex-4-treated mice.

ex- <dig> and lir treatments attenuate mcao- induced voiding impairments
figure  <dig> shows the protective effects of ex- <dig> and lir against mcao-induced bladder dysfunction in db/db mice. figure 7a shows a representative recording of intravesical pressure  before and after mcao injury in control, mcao, ex-4-treated mcao, and lir-treated mcao groups. mcao significantly reduced voiding contractions  and increased nonvoiding contractions ; these effects were significantly attenuated by treatment with ex- <dig> and lir.fig.  <dig> effects of exendin- <dig> and liraglutide on mcao-induced bladder dysfunction in db/db mice. a typical intravesical pressure  traces before and after surgery in control, mcao, ex-4-treated mcao, and lir-treated mcao groups. voiding contractions  and nonvoiding contractions  are labeled. b mcao significantly reduced voiding contractions and c increased nonvoiding contractions; these effects were partially reversed by ex- <dig> and lir treatments. groups were compared using two-way anova with a post hoc bonferroni adjustment for pairwise comparisons. *p <  <dig>  compared to the control group; #

discussion
the results of this study demonstrate protective effects of the glp- <dig> analogs ex- <dig> and lir against mcao-induced cerebral blood flow impairment, blood and brain ros production, oxidative stress-related and inflammatory protein expression, and impairments in motor and cognitive function and bladder contraction in the db/db mouse model of diabetes. mcao decreased cerebral microcirculation in db/db mice and increased blood and brain ros production and nf-κb, icam- <dig>  caspase  <dig>  and tunel expression. ex- <dig> and lir treatment in mice subjected to mcao resulted in significantly higher cerebral blood flow, preservation of mnsod expression, lower blood and brain ros counts, and lower nf-κb, icam- <dig>  caspase  <dig> and tunel expression compared to untreated mcao mice. expression of p-akt and p-enos expression was not affected by mcao but was significantly enhanced by ex- <dig> and lir treatments. ex- <dig> and lir treatments also mitigated mcao-induced motor and cognitive deficits and micturition dysfunction, as indicated by reduced voiding contractions and increased nonvoiding contractions. as shown in the fig.  <dig>  magnetic resonance imaging data show that mcao-induced brain edema was significantly reduced by lir and ex- <dig> treatments.

several previous studies indicate that glp- <dig> and glp-1r agonists are neuroprotective  <cit> . these molecules are small enough to cross the blood–brain barrier , and glp-1rs are widely expressed throughout the brain. our recent data indicate that ex- <dig> treatment reduces stroke-induced frontal cortex edema, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, and upregulation of aquaporin  <dig>  glial fibrillary acid protein, and icam- <dig>  <cit> . briyal et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ex- <dig> significantly protected rats from mcao-induced cerebral ischemia, reducing the infarct volume by up to 27 % and reducing neurological deficits and oxidative stress parameters. these results suggest that ex- <dig> and lir are attractive candidates for reducing oxidative injury and inflammation in the brain. elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of ex- <dig> and lir action in the brains of diabetic animals will require further investigation, although some reports have demonstrated that ex- <dig> treatment in diabetic rats before and after stroke reduces ischemic brain damage by arresting microglial infiltration and increasing stroke-induced neural stem cell proliferation  <cit> .

brain ischemia and reperfusion initiate a complex cascade of metabolic events, several of which generate nitrogen and oxygen free radicals that mediate much of the damage that occurs after transient brain ischemia  <cit> . mcao has previously been shown to increase the activity of nadph oxidase and nitric oxide synthases in neurons, vascular endothelium, infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, activated microglia, and astrocytes  <cit> ; in the present study, we show that mcao increases icam- <dig> expression and dhe labeling of ros. we found that blood and brain ros levels were significantly elevated after mcao, especially at  <dig> h after injury. nf-κb nuclear translocation and icam- <dig> upregulation in the damaged brain cause leukocyte infiltration, adhesion, and migration, which lead to ros production, inflammation, and oxidative injury. in this study, we observed that ex- <dig> and lir treatment significantly inhibited mcao-induced nf-κb and icam- <dig> activation and ros production. teramoto et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that suppression of oxidative damage is a key factor in neuroprotection. although the exact mechanisms of ex-4- and lir-mediated reductions in mcao-induced ros production remain unclear, we suggest that ex- <dig> and lir act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents to decrease mcao-induced brain inflammation and injury.

insulin and glucose levels can also influence brain injury. evidence from several studies indicates that increased insulin can mitigate damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion. hui et al.  <cit>  showed that pretreating rats with insulin before cerebral ischemia significantly increases the number of surviving ca <dig> pyramidal cells in the hippocampus after 5 days of reperfusion. another study reported that, in diabetic rats subjected to cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, insulin treatment decreased brain lesion volume, as well as basal and injury-induced apoptotis  <cit> . our results show that ex- <dig> exerts protective effects against ischemia-induced damage in db/db mice, which have higher serum insulin levels than normal mice. one previous study reported that ex- <dig> treatment did not influence serum insulin levels in db/db mice  <cit> . together, these results suggest that ex- <dig> may be an appropriate therapeutic agent in diabetic stroke patients.

the effects of glp- <dig> agonist treatment on the signaling pathways that affect oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related protein expression have been documented previously. ex- <dig> directly improves impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas via camp/ampk-enos pathway  <cit> . ex- <dig> also attenuates neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury via camp/pka pathway and inhibits tnfα production by peritoneal macrophages in response to inflammatory  <cit> . glp- <dig> analog, lir, promote neuronal survival and attenuate mda oxidative stress and anti-apoptosis following by cerebral ischemia  <cit> . ex- <dig> upregulates camp and triggers creb phosphorylation  <cit> , leading to the upregulation of bcl- <dig>  <cit> , which in turn inhibits apoptosis  <cit> . our results show that ex- <dig> and lir significantly decrease bax expression and the bax/bcl- <dig> ratio, leading to reduced apoptosis, possibly through stimulation of akt and enos signaling. akt pathway activation in ischemic regions has been reported to reduce ischemia- and reperfusion-induced damage by modulating the endothelial nitric oxide pathway  <cit> . in this study, we observed that ex- <dig> and lir treatments significantly increased p-akt and p-enos levels following mcao, indicating the recruitment of protective signaling pathways against oxidative stress.

fu et al.  <cit>  showed that cytokine and neuronal nos levels are elevated in the lumbosacral spinal cord of rats subjected to mcao, far from the injury site. in the spinal cord, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β immunoreactivities were mainly localized to the ventral horn motor neurons contralateral to the site of mcao. neuronal nos immunoreactivity and nadph-diaphorase staining in the spinal cord were also markedly increased in response to mcao. this, together with some neuronal deaths, may be linked to the dysfunction of the latter in a clinical stroke  <cit> . a previous study has demonstrated significant reductions in voided volume per micturition and significantly increased voiding frequency following mild forebrain ischemia in rats  <cit> . consistent with these results, our unpublished data show that mcao evokes frontal cortex injury in rats and inhibits efferent pelvic nerve activity, resulting in impaired voiding function, especially phase  <dig> of the voiding contraction, which is regulated by pelvic nerve activity. ex- <dig> treatment restores pelvic parasympathetic nerve activity in these studies, indicating its protective effect against brain injury. as our data indicate that ex- <dig> and lir treatments ameliorate mcao-induced bladder hyperactivity, we believe that ex- <dig> or lir may be promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of stroke-induced bladder hyperactivity.

CONCLUSIONS
diabetic mice treated with glp- <dig> agonists after ischemia/reperfusion injury  exhibited increased cerebral blood flow, decreased ros production, and decreased expression of oxidative stress-, inflammation-, and apoptosis-related proteins in the brain. treatment with glp- <dig> agonists also mitigated mcao-evoked cognitive and motor impairments and stimulated protective signaling pathways and antioxidant mnsod expression in the brain area that mediates parasympathetic/pelvic nerve-mediated voiding contractions. these results suggest that glp- <dig> agonists may be useful in the treatment of cerebral and cardiovascular complications of diabetes.
