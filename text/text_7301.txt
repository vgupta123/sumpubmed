BACKGROUND
bovine herpesviruses  <dig>  and  <dig>  are closely related alphaherpesviruses infecting cattle  <cit> . the major difference between bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig> is the distinct ability of the former to cause neurological disease in cattle  <cit> . in a natural infection via the respiratory tract, bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig> replicate similarly in the nasal mucosa but they differ in their neuroinvasiveness  <cit> . bohv- <dig> neuroinvasion usually does not go further than the first order neuron located in the trigeminal ganglia, where the latent infection is established, whereas bohv- <dig> is able to infect different regions of the brain  <cit> .

the bohv- <dig> genome is  <dig>  base pairs  long and is approximately  <dig>  bp longer than the bohv- <dig> genome, with a g + c base composition of 75%  <cit> . these viruses exhibit an average of 82% amino acid identity amongst different proteins. the most similar proteins  are those involved in viral dna replication and processing of virion proteins  <cit> .

because of the great similarity between bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig>  the differentiation by conventional techniques such as viral isolation, immunofluorescence and neutralization test is difficult and has implications for the diagnosis as well as for bohv- <dig> vaccination and eradication programs  <cit> . however, these viruses exhibit some important genetic and immunogenic differences, which would explain their pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics  <cit> . bohv- <dig> is the causal agent of meningo-encephalitis; a condition of low morbidity and high lethality. it usually affects cattle up to  <dig> months old  <cit>  although older animals can also be affected. this neurological disease is associated with a variety of clinical signs, including tremors, circling, bruxism, incoordination and recumbency, followed by convulsions, padding and inevitable death  <cit> . although sporadic cases of meningo-encephalitis by bohv- <dig> have been reported in australia  <cit> , italy  <cit>  and hungary  <cit> , bohv- <dig> infection and disease are more frequent in argentina and brazil; where numerous outbreaks have been described in the last decades  <cit> . the rare occurrence of bohv- <dig> neurological disease in areas where bohv- <dig> infection is endemic could be explained by cross-protection induced by bohv- <dig> natural infection or vaccination  <cit> .

restriction endonuclease analysis  has been widely used to compare bohv- <dig> isolates  <cit> . it proved to be particularly useful for the differentiation among various ruminant alphaherpesviruses antigenically related to bohv- <dig>  which show distinct dna fingerprints  <cit> . additionally, this technique allows the subtyping of viruses that apparently belong to the same type  <cit> .

traditionally, the differentiation between bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig> is based on the clinico- epidemiological characteristics of the outbreaks followed by rea of viral dna after virus isolation. however, it is not highly precise because bohv- <dig> can also be responsible for neurological disease  <cit> . furthermore, immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , pcr followed by rea  <cit> , nested pcr  <cit>  and multiplex pcr  <cit>  are also available.

different strains of bohv- <dig> were previously classified and designed as bohv- <dig> "a"; bohv- <dig> "b" and bohv- <dig> "non-a, non-b" according to rea  <cit> . a subtle antigenic difference was shown between subtypes "a" and "b"  <cit> .

the first outbreak of bohv- <dig> in argentina was described in 1982; when the reference strain a <dig> was isolated. this viral strain was classified by rea as subtype "b" which has only been described in argentina so far. therefore, the aims of this study are to compare and characterize by rea the genomes of argentinean bohv- <dig> isolates obtained from cattle with neurological disease since  <dig> until now. furthermore, we identified the mutation that leads to the change in the restriction pattern of the strain a <dig>  we describe a simple diagnostic method based on pcr-rea system that allows an easy discrimination between bohv- <dig> "a" and "b" subtypes.

RESULTS
most of the isolates included in this study come from outbreaks that occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> in buenos aires province . as summarized in table  <dig>  most of the field bohv- <dig> strains were isolated and amplified from the brain of cattle affected with encephalitis. the virus was also isolated from ocular swabs and from the lung of animals with respiratory disease. all viruses isolated from tissues of cattle were successfully amplified. pcr analysis allowed the differentiation between bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig> based on the size of the pcr products . all field isolates from cattle were bohv- <dig> .

most field isolates  showed a bsteii rea pattern similar to the reference strain n <dig>  prototype of bohv-5a . only one field strain ) presented a rea pattern similar to the argentinean reference strain a <dig> prototype of bohv-5b. the s-n- <dig>  was isolated in  <dig>  one year after the isolation of the strain a <dig> .

a fragment of  <dig> pb of the ul <dig> gene, encoding the bohv- <dig> glycoprotein b  from the reference strain of bohv- <dig> and seventeen isolates of bohv- <dig> were sequenced. a consistent alignment provided by a  <dig> bp fragment from this gene revealed a point mutation  in the bsteii restriction site of subtype "b" of bohv- <dig>  responsible for the variation in the rea pattern. the point mutation is shown in alignment with the reference subtypes of bohv- <dig> and the isolates .

the specific 534-bp pcr product was consistently obtained as a clear electrophoretic band from all isolates and reference strains of bohv- <dig>  the digestion of the pcr products with the restriction enzyme bsteii generated distinct restriction patterns depending on the origin of the amplified viral dna :  <dig> and  <dig> bp for bohv- <dig> "a" subtype and  <dig> bp for bohv- <dig> b 

discussion
a high seroprevalence for bohv- <dig> was reported in argentina  <cit> . by now, the proportion of this percentage that can be attributed to bohv- <dig> is unknown since diagnostic tests do not differentiate between anti- bohv- <dig> and -bohv- <dig> antibodies  <cit> . although the clinical manifestations of bohv- <dig> and  <dig> are slightly different, this is not sufficient to allow a precise distinction between virus species. furthermore, cases of meningo-encephalitis can also be consequence of bohv- <dig> infection  <cit> . neighboring countries have reported the circulation of bohv- <dig> subtypes "a" and non-"a" non -"b" although argentina was the first and the only country to report the isolation of a bohv- <dig> strain belonging to subtype "b"  <cit> .

it has been reported that some outbreaks attributed to the subtype "a" group occurred with respiratory signs in the absence of nervous manifestations . indeed, in diseased animals, virus infection is not restricted to the central nervous system  <cit> . further studies will be required to determine why these bohv- <dig> isolates were non-neuropathogenic under these natural conditions.

several outbreaks occurring between  <dig> and  <dig>  mainly in the central region of argentina, were determined to be caused by bohv- <dig>   <cit> . in many cases there were no records of morbidity and mortality, except for the outbreak in which the strain a <dig> was isolated, where 15%  animals died. ten percent of the isolates recovered during this period showed slower growth and smaller plaques in tissue culture than the jura strain of bohv- <dig>  in this report, we also observed one isolate of bohv- <dig> with poor growth in cell culture , which was classified as subtype "b". this field strain was isolated in  <dig> from a meningo-encephalitis outbreak in arroyo corto, saavedra district, located southwest of the buenos aires province; the affected herd consisted of  <dig> bovines; with only one fatality case. this farm had presented a similar outbreak in july-august  <dig>  interestingly, this strain affected older animals  than the historical case attributed to a <dig> .

according to our study, it is evident that in argentina both subtypes "a" and "b" circulated for some time and, apparently the circulation of subtype "a" is more recent. as in brazil, the co-circulation of subtypes "a" and non "a", non "b" was reported  <cit> , further studies are required to determine whether subtype non "a" non "b" is present or will appear in argentina and whether subtype "b" will definitely disappeared.

in this study, we were also able to determine the region of the subtype "b" genome which is responsible for the different bsteii restriction patterns. the c-t substitution observed in the gene encoding gb, a glycoprotein that is involved in the entry and cell-to-cell spread of virus  <cit>  did not introduce an amino-acid change. the digestion of the pcr products with the restriction enzyme bsteii allowed the easy discrimination between "a" and "b" subtypes the diagnostic system based on pcr products has been tested on seventeen isolates and references strains, however before considering the general applicability of this assay it will be necessary to analyze more samples of all bohv- <dig> subtypes.

the fragment amplified by pcr shows significant differences at the amino-acid level when compared with the published sequence of this portion of the gene. it will be necessary to conduct further studies to prove whether the changes present in the gb gene of subtype "b" viruses can be related to a specific pattern of virus spread and properties, as observed by schudel and collaborators  <cit>  regarding the formation of smaller plaques in cell culture and slower growth kinetics with respect to the reference virus.

a further epidemiological study would be required to investigate why the circulation of subtype "b" viruses is restricted to argentina and why it was only observed in  <dig> and  <dig>  it would also be important to determine whether these isolates exhibit a distinct behavior in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
according to our knowledge, this is the first report on the circulation of bohv- <dig> subtype "a" in argentina. we determined that a mutation in the gb gene is responsible for the difference in the restriction pattern between subtypes "a" and "b". according to the number of samples analyzed, most of the field isolates - including the current ones - belong to subtype "a". subtype "b" was only isolated during a transient period in  <dig> and  <dig>  and apparently is no longer circulating in the country.
