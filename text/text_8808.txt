BACKGROUND
campylobacteriosis in the most common foodborne disease in european countries, with an overall incidence of  <dig>  cases per  <dig>  population  <cit> ; in canada, with  <dig>  cases every  <dig>  person-years  <cit> ; and the third most important bacterial foodborne diseases in the us  <cit> . campylobacter spp. are found still at high prevalence in retail broiler carcasses in the us , and the isolation of campylobacter spp. from clinical and food samples has always been done using microaerobic conditions, generally 85% n <dig>  10% co <dig> and 5% o <dig>  during the enrichment of the samples and during the incubation of plate media. different methods have been developed to generate microaerobic atmospheres and for a small number of samples, sachets that generate co <dig> are commonly used  <cit> . if a larger number of samples are processed weekly, the evacuation-replacement is a more economical alternative. in this system, the air in the jar is partially removed by a vacuum pump and then replaced with a microaerobic gas mix. for a large number of samples, or to create unique microaerobic gas mixes with increased h <dig> content, more sophisticated microaerobic workstations have been developed  <cit> .

besides generating microaerobic conditions, several o2-quenching agents have been traditionally added to enrichment broths and agar plates for the isolation of campylobacter spp. these agents neutralize the toxic effects of oxygen radicals and include blood or alkaline hematin , charcoal  <cit> , iron salts and norepinephrine  <cit> , and ferrous sulfate, sodium metabisulfite and sodium pyruvate   <cit> . in general, if blood or charcoal is added to agar plates, no other o <dig> quenching compounds are added  <cit> . to ensure the microaerobic gas mix for the length of incubation  sealed jars are commonly used, although plastic bags utilized to freeze food products with a "ziplock" type closing to prevent air leaks have been successfully used with gas-generating sachets and manual evacuation-replacement systems .

although a microaerobic mix is indispensable to grow campylobacter spp. on agar plates, we have long suspected that no extra addition of any microaerobic gas mix is needed to keep campylobacter spp. alive or even grow them in enrichment broths. in the present study we evaluated  <dig> retail broiler meat samples and compared the efficacy of bolton broth incubated under microaerobic conditions using an evacuation-replacement system  versus incubation under aerobic conditions  for the isolation of naturally occurring campylobacter spp. presumptive campylobacter spp. collected on agar plates were confirmed and identified with multiplex polymerase chain reaction  assays and their dna relatedness was analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . in addition, enriched broth cultures were analyzed with ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis  and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  to determine the variability in the total bacterial population profiles of enrichment broths from subsamples m and a. our results indicate that microaerobic conditions that allow campylobacter spp. to grow are naturally created in enrichment broths without the addition of extra microaerobic gas mix, and therefore a simplified method has been developed to identify these bacteria in food samples.

RESULTS
similar number of campylobacter positive subsamples
from  <dig> retail broiler meat samples analyzed for the presence of campylobacter spp.,  <dig>  were positive from the microaerobic subsamples , and  <dig>  were positive from the aerobic subsamples . combining the data from subsamples m and a resulted in a total of  <dig>  positive samples for campylobacter spp. statistical comparison by chi-square showed that the number of campylobacter positives from subsamples m and a were similar , even when analyzing the subsamples by product  . the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were high , and the kappa values were above  <dig>  for all comparisons, with the observed agreement in the kappa value  always above  <dig>   <cit> . these high values reflected the large number of samples that were either positive  or negative  in both subsamples m and a, as calculated by 2-by- <dig> tables . receiver operating characteristic  curves also showed that the true positive fraction was high and within the 95% confidence interval calculated for this dataset .

bacterial diversity measured by risa and dgge studies vary considerably among samples and subsamples
the results from the arisa analysis of  <dig> subsamples m and  <dig> complimentary subsamples a, chosen at random, showed a large variation in the microbial community and a lack of similarity patters intra- or inter-sample . similar results were found using bionumerics and the pearson correlation to compare the band patterns of subsamples m and a by dgge. even when analyzing the data using the dice coefficient, which takes into account band migration, the results from subsamples m and a showed low dna similarity at a cutoff point of 90% . table  <dig> shows the nearest neighbor identified from a blastn comparison of dgge band sequences from subsamples m and a. sequencing information suggested that the bacteria present in most subsamples were facultative anaerobes and microaerobic organisms. blast results indicated a high degree of similarity of some rdna amplicons  with acinetobacter sp., campylobacter jejuni, lactobacillus sp. and pseudomonas sp., and lower identity  with lactobacillus sp. and uncultured bacterial species. the sample that showed the largest bands separation had five well-distributed dna bands in the gel . this sample was used consistently in dgge gels as marker to normalize the gels and to allow for gel-to-gel comparisons using bionumerics. a blast comparison showed that the sequences from these bands were similar to acinetobacter sp. and lactobacillus sp. .

marker bands were used in all the gels.

o <dig> content decreased during the incubation of enrichment broths
in samples incubated in bolton broth without the addition of any microaerobic gas mix, the amount of o <dig> in the head space of the bags decreased over time and was at or below 17% at  <dig> h of incubation. the amount of o <dig> in the atmosphere was stable between  <dig> and 16% by  <dig> h of incubation; however, the amount of o <dig> never reached less than 14% . the amount of dissolved o <dig> in the enrichment broth, measured one inch from the bottom of the enrichment bags, reached  <dig> ppm at around  <dig> h of incubation. this value was stable thereafter and never reached above  <dig>  ppm . the presence of naturally occurring campylobacter spp., either c. jejuni or c. coli, did not alter any of the values obtained with the sensors. in addition, incubation of  <dig> ml of bolton broth without meat samples and without the addition of blood resulted in a similar pattern of do values. in samples in which the o <dig> sensors were double bagged and gassed with a microaerobic gas mix, the do decreased to around  <dig> ppm and remained stable for up to  <dig> h . identical patterns of dissolved o <dig> levels were found when using ziplock plastic bags commonly used to freeze food products  .

discussion
several methods have been developed to generate microaerobic conditions for the growth and multiplication of campylobacter spp. these methods are routine and are consistently used during the enrichment of food samples or during the incubation of inoculated plate media. however, little is known about the actual changes in o <dig> content in enrichment broth media during incubation . our experiments were aimed at determining the changes of o <dig> content in the broth and in the air of the head space of the bags used to enrich the samples for the isolation of campylobacter from retail broiler meat. the premises of this work was that the incubation of enrichment broth may naturally create microaerobiosis conducive to the grow of campylobacter spp. samples were therefore divided in two subsamples which were in turn incubated under microaerobic conditions  or aerobic conditions .

we used an unpaired sample design, where the enrichment conditions differ between the reference  and the alternative method , and confirmed all presumptive positives using the same molecular protocols. because the comparison of two qualitative methods is best accomplished near the limit of detection of these methods, we used naturally contaminated broiler meat samples, which have the lowest contamination that can be naturally found . the statistical analyses of data from unpaired samples are performed in the same way as for paired samples, mainly using mcnemar's chi square test  <cit> . the number of campylobacter positive subsamples was statistically similar between subsamples m and a, and all isolates were clearly identified as c. jejuni or c. coli. these results demonstrate that enrichment broths incubated under normal, aerobic conditions are sufficient to detect campylobacter spp. in retail broiler meat. there was an increase in number of total positive samples by 10% when combining the result of the two subsamples. these findings have been already reported several times for commercial broiler meat naturally contaminated with campylobacter spp. . in addition, a roc curve of the data showed a high true positive fraction, or rate, and a very low false positive fraction, which indicated a very strong correspondence in the results between the reference  and the alternative methods .

the traditional methodology of enriching  <dig> g of meat is the one suggested by the bacteriological analytical manual of the food and drug administration   <cit> , the microbiology laboratory guidebook of the food safety and inspection services of the u. s. department of agriculture   <cit> , the international organization for standardization  <cit> , the health protection agency of the uk  <cit> , and several other countries' regulatory agencies. however, this methodology does not appear to be optimized to detect the true prevalence of campylobacter spp. in retail broiler meat. pcr analysis of the isolates showed that c. jejuni or c. coli species are the only campylobacter spp. found in retail broiler meat. some samples can be contaminated with both species  <cit>  but again the current methodology used in food samples is not accurate enough to reveal the extent of contamination of the same product with different campylobacter strains. pfge analysis further demonstrated that a single meat sample could be contaminated with two, or maybe more, isolates from the same species. for all practical purposes, c. jejuni and c. coli are the only two campylobacter spp. found in retail poultry meat because no c. lari has been identified since the introduction of molecular techniques for routine identification of campylobacter isolates, approximately  <dig> years ago  <cit> . the data collected with the o <dig> sensors showed that the amount of o <dig> in the enrichment broth was stable around 5- <dig> ppm after  <dig> h of enrichment. these o <dig> levels can be obtained by pressing out the air before closing the sample bags, and without the need of any vacuum, as is required when removing the air from a hard container. whirl-pak or ziplock bags performed similarly, showing that they are impervious to changes in the air trapped inside  <cit> . the fact that bags with only the enrichment broth  created microaerobic conditions has encouraged us to continue this line of research, and we are currently testing other broths without blood to isolate campylobacter spp. from retail broiler meat. therefore, an inexpensive, simplified method can be developed for routinely use in the isolation and detection of campylobacter spp. from food products.

incubation of broth under normal aerobic conditions, with or without airspace, was done in the early 1980s to isolate campylobacter spp. from fecal samples  <cit> , and the use of 10% o <dig>  10% co <dig> and 80% of n <dig> facilitated and sustained the growth of campylobacter spp.  <cit> . the iso normative 10272-1: <dig> requires a microaerobic environment but provides for an alternative incubation in a microaerobic atmosphere created by "screw-capped bottles or flasks filled with enrichment broth, leaving a headspace of less than  <dig> cm, and tightly closing the caps"  <cit> . but much has been speculated about the need to have a higher surface area of the meat samples during enrichment to yield a higher number of positive samples under microaerobic conditions  <cit> , or the exact depth of the airspace, the appropriate ratio of air to broth  <cit> , and the correct type of incubation container to promote the growth of campylobacter jejuni  <cit>  to avoid significant difference in the results if a microaerobic atmosphere is not used  <cit> . therefore, the microaerobic conditions are routinely used to isolate campylobacter spp. however, our results do not suggest any correlation between surface and microaerobic conditions and do not support the notion that air to broth ratio and the type of container are indispensable to isolate campylobacter spp. our results point to the simple fact that any closed plastic bag naturally produces microaerobic environments conducive to the growth of campylobacter spp. without the need to add any microaerobic gas mix. in our experiments, bags were closed to leave a minimum airspace and the samples were mixed, without stomaching, for few seconds. thus, bags with subsamples m had the same contact surface as bags with subsamples a.

the microbial population of the enriched samples in bolton broth, as assessed by risa and dgge, was diverse. there are no current data on the microbial assemblage of retail broiler meat as a predictor to the presence of a bacterial pathogen, such as campylobacter. most of the work on the bacterial community of broiler meat was done more than  <dig> years ago using direct bacterial counts, and very few research studies have used culture-independent methods to study the microbial profile of these foods  <cit> . it is known, however, that some cold-tolerant bacteria, such as enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter and pseudomonas, are commonly present on broiler meat  <cit> . these bacteria are primarily facultative anaerobes or microaerobic organisms, and the ribosomal rna gene sequences recovered in our samples, especially form the most prominent bands from dgge gels, had a high similarity to these bacterial groups.

risa and dgge can be used to broadly characterize the total microbial population in complex samples. the results from these techniques were analyzed using the pearson correlation, which is the standard procedure for comparison of densitometric curves . we analyzed the results with the pearson correlation and also the dice coefficient, which takes into account only the band position and not the band thickness, as it is the case in densitometric curves. although the dice correlation showed a higher dna relatedness among corresponding m and a subsamples, the variability in the bacterial populations in each set of subsamples was still large and appeared to be more attributable to the original bacterial composition of the sampled meat itself than to the enrichment conditions . a significant limitation of dgge-derived phylogenetic data with the primers used in this study is the relatively short rdna sequence obtained from each amplicon, thereby reducing the degree of phylogenetic inference that may be assigned to each band. yet, both risa and dgge produced consistent results regarding the variability in the bacterial assemblages associated with retail broiler meat samples.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results indicated that the enrichment of retail broiler meat at 42Â°c in closed plastic bags and without the addition of a microaerobic mix is adequate for the isolation of campylobacter spp. with the advancement of dna-based biosensors and automation for bacterial detection, enrichment broths could be screened for the presence of campylobacter spp. in a shorter time, with greater sensitivity and without the generation of any microaerobic condition. in addition, food microbiology laboratories interested in establishing techniques for the isolation of campylobacter from retail meat will have access to a cost-effective enrichment procedure without the need to invest in systems to generate microaerobiosis. reference documents from the fda and fsis usda should eventually be updated to provide for an alternative, simplified protocol that yields similar number of campylobacter positive samples as the current reference protocols.
