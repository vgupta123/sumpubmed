BACKGROUND
beta-glucosides are carbohydrates that contain a core glucose molecule that has an r-group attached to the c-l carbon. the r-group may be another carbohydrate or various other molecules such as amino acids or ringed compounds. beta-glucosides are commonly found in nature in various sources such as tuberous vegetables. these compounds are generally broken down for the glucose molecule, while the r-group may or may not be metabolized. beta-glucoside utilization systems have been described in several bacteria including escherichia coli  <cit> , erwinia chrysanthemi  <cit> , clostridium longisporum  <cit> , lactobacillus plantarium  <cit> , bacillus subtilis  <cit> , and streptococcus mutans  <cit> . all of these organisms rely on the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system   <cit>  for the transport of beta-glucosides into the bacterial cell.

it has been previously shown that the s. mutans bglp gene encodes a beta-glucoside-specific enzyme ii of the pts  <cit> . an additional open reading frame adjacent to bglp has been isolated, sequenced, and examined for a possible regulatory function  <cit> . the open reading frame encodes a putative regulatory protein of the bglg family of transcriptional antiterminators  <cit> . antiterminator proteins are believed to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the beta-glucoside-specific genes present within e. coli  <cit> , e. chrysanthemi  <cit> , l. lactis  <cit> , l. plantarium  <cit> , b. subtilis  <cit> , and c. longisporum  <cit> . this type of antiterminator protein has been shown to bind to a ribonucleic antitermination  site  <cit> , which is a palindromic sequence that may form multiple hairpin structures in the mrna, some of which would act as a transcriptional terminator. binding of one of these potential rna structures by the antiterminator protein prevents the formation of the transcription terminator hairpin structure  <cit>  and results in the elongation of the mrna via transcriptional read through into the region encoding the beta-glucoside-specific gene product that is not normally transcribed. thus, the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by antitermination allows for the expression of the beta-glucoside-specific loci only in the presence of a beta-glucoside  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms behind the process of antitermination have been studied most extensively in e. coli. and b. subtilis. the bglgfb operon in e. coli encodes an antiterminator protein , an eii component of the pts that is specific for beta-glucosides , and a phospho-beta-glucosidase   <cit> . the bglg protein is responsible for binding two transcription terminators flanking the bglg gene  <cit> , which results in the production of a full-length transcript and full induction of the bgl operon  <cit> . it has subsequently been shown that the eii protein  also plays a regulatory role in antitermination  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of beta-glucoside-specific loci in b. subtilis by the licr and lict proteins are less documented. the licbcah operon in b. subtilis has been shown to be responsible for the catabolism of cellobiose and lichenan  <cit> . the licbca genes encode the eii component of the pts and a phospho-beta-glucosidase is encoded by the lich gene  <cit> . this lic operon was determined to be regulated in part by the licr protein  <cit> . the licr protein has been shown to contain several pts regulation domains   <cit> , and, presumably, the licr protein is stimulated upon the phosphorylation of these prds  <cit> . the activity of the licr protein has also been shown to be negatively effected by phosphorylation of the eiia domain encoded by the licbca genes  <cit> .

b. subtilis has a second beta-glucoside specific locus, the bglph operon, that is responsible for the breakdown of the beta-glucosides salicin and arbutin  <cit> . the bglph operon, encoding the eii component of the pts  and a phospho-beta-glucosidase , is regulated by the lict antiterminator protein  <cit> . the lict protein has been shown to be phosphorylated by hpr-phosphate  <cit> , which allows the formation of an active lict dimer  <cit> .

we have previously determined that the s. mutans lict protein functions as regulator of various genes within the bglp regulon  <cit> . the gene encoding the lict protein is located immediately 5' to a putative rat binding site and the bglp gene . the lict protein, which is highly homologous to other antiterminator proteins, has a co-antiterminator domain   <cit>  and two pts regulatory domains   <cit>  . cat domains form symmetrical dimers that bind rna and are only found in antitermination proteins that regulate sugar uptake and metabolism in bacteria  <cit> . the lict prd domains contain potential sites for phosphorylation by the molecules that would putatively regulate lict activity, either hpr-p or an enzyme ii-p  <cit> . thus, the s. mutans bglp gene is potentially regulated by antitermination by the lict protein.

the putative rat site is highly conserved with other antitermination protein binding sites  <cit> . this genetic element is a region of diad symmetry that may form a hairpin structure at the 5' end of an mrna molecule . this structure , when stabilized by the binding of a dimerized and active antitermination protein such as the lict molecule, would inhibit transcription termination and allow transcription to proceed through the 3' gene, bglp.

this report provides a transcriptional analysis of the s. mutans bglp locus that is putatively regulated by the mechanism of transcriptional antitermination in the presence of esculin. the lict protein is essential for efficient expression of the bglp gene and esculin hydrolysis by s. mutans in the presence of glucose. physical examination of the bglp gene and its rna transcripts has generated evidence that supports the hypothesis that the bglp locus is regulated by an antitermination mechanism mediated by the lict protein. this report is the first demonstration of the antitermination process in s. mutans.

RESULTS
localization of the bglp promoter
upon determining that the lict protein might be involved in the regulation of bglp  <cit> , experiments were undertaken to further localize the bglp promoter activity. beta-galactosidase assays had previously illustrated that the  <dig> bp xbai-hindiii fragment cloned in palh <dig> contained regulated promoter activity. sequence analysis of the region 5' to the bglp gene revealed putative consensus - <dig> and - <dig> promoter elements located within the xbai-hindiii restriction fragment. five additional reporter constructs were created to more precisely locate the promoter of the bglp gene . these constructs contained various deletions within the putative bglp promoter region and eliminated various putative promoter elements. the various deletion constructs were analyzed for their relative transcriptional activity in either the presence or absence of the inducer, esculin. as depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  both the putative - <dig>  and - <dig>  regions are required to be present in the reporter construct for any detectable transcriptional activity initiating from this region of s. mutans dna. the constructs containing only one of these regions  or neither region  do not express detectable levels of β-galactosidase activity .

the dna sequence from the xbai-hindiii fragment located 5' to the region contained in palh <dig>  did not contribute significantly to the transcriptional activity associated with the bglp gene. this point is observed when examining the relative activity of palh <dig> and palh <dig> . however, further deletion of the dna toward the putative - <dig> region in palh <dig> does affect the activity of the promoter. this construct contains only  <dig> bp 5' to the putative - <dig> region and exhibits approximately 50% of the relative activity of palh <dig> and palh <dig>  the additional  <dig> bases contained in palh <dig> upstream of the - <dig> region appear to enhance transcription from the bglp promoter. it was also demonstrated that the region located 3' of the - <dig> promoter region, as contained in palh <dig>  is not associated with detectable levels of β-galactosidase activity .

a reporter plasmid that contained only the - <dig> and - <dig> region  was also constructed. in this construct, the entire rat sequence  was absent. this construct would be predicted to have constitutive expression because both the sequence required for transcription termination in the absence of beta-glucosides and the sequence required for antitermination in the presence of beta-glucosides were removed. this plasmid was highly unstable in s. mutans and underwent spontaneous deletion events . presumably, unfettered expression of the e. coli beta-galactosidase enzyme from the consensus - <dig> and - <dig> promoter regions of the bglp gene was toxic to the s. mutans cells.

in addition, this series of plasmid reporter constructs was transformed into alh <dig> . the resultant transformants were assayed for beta-galactosidase activity. none of the plasmid constructs in the alh <dig> background displayed any significant beta-galactosidase activity when compared to the activity found in the wild-type strain . these results confirm the in vivo fermentation data previously reported  <cit> . these data confirm that the lict protein is essential for optimal transcriptional activity of the bglp promoter region.

determination of the transcriptional start site of the bglp gene
primer extension experiments were performed to identify the transcriptional start site of the bglp gene. these experiments determined that the major start of transcription mapped to a single nucleotide . the transcriptional start point, a single g, is  <dig> base pairs upstream of the putative ribosomal binding site aaggag and  <dig> base pairs upstream of the initiation codon  of the bglp gene. the transcriptional start point is located  <dig> bp 3' to the - <dig> promoter elements and located  <dig> base pairs 5' of the putative rat sequence .

northern blot analysis of the bglp transcript
to confirm previous work that suggested the bglp and bglb genes do not constitute an operon  <cit>  and to determine the actual size of the bglp transcript, northern blot analysis was performed on total rna isolated from s. mutans. the northern blot identified a transcript that corresponded with the proposed size of the bglp transcript,  <dig>  kb . there were no transcripts larger than the bglp transcript, suggesting that the bglp gene and downstream bglb gene do not comprise an operon. these data confirm previous results obtained from β-galactosidase assays that indicated the bglp gene is transcribed on a monocistronic transcript  <cit> , these data, combined with the identification of the transcriptional start site, also indicate that the bglp gene is not co-transcribed with the regulatory lict gene as it is in other beta-glucoside systems.

size determination of the terminated bglp transcript
transcript mapping experiments were undertaken to further evaluate the hypothesis that the process of antitermination regulates the bglp transcript and that a short, terminated bglp transcript would be observed in rna collected from s. mutans cells grown in the absence of esculin. mung bean nuclease transcript mapping experiments have identified a small  <dig> base transcript that is present in the total rna from uninduced s. mutans cells . the identification of this terminated bglp transcript adds further validity to the hypothesis that antitermination regulates this locus.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we have demonstrated that the bglp gene of s. mutans produces a short, truncated mrna transcript of  <dig> bases in the absence of the inducer, esculin. in the presence of esculin, a  <dig>  kb transcript is produced. the start site of transcription for both of these mrna molecules is located  <dig> bases 3' to the - <dig> promoter element and  <dig> bases 5' to a putative rat site at which the antiterminator protein lict would presumably bind to allow expression of the bglp gene. the locations of these genetic elements are shown in figure  <dig>  in addition, the lict protein has been shown to be essential for the expression of the bglp gene by use of transcriptional gene fusions in a s. mutans licti::Ω-kan <dig> genetic background. these data and the fact that the lict protein and the rat site are highly conserved with other putative antitermination regulatory systems imply that the lict protein interacts with the bglp rat site to control expression of this pts permease gene.

it has been previously illustrated that the lict gene product regulates the expression of the bglp gene  <cit> . it was hypothesized that this regulation involved transcriptional antitermination of the bglp transcript. this report supports this hypothesis that the lict antiterminator protein is regulating the bglp gene via binding of the rat structure. the s. mutans bgl regulon has been previously shown to be unique from other beta-glucosidase operons because of several characteristics. this regulon has a novel arrangement of four adjacent genes with at least four separate transcriptional units  <cit> . this includes the bglc gene, which is located in the middle of the regulon and is transcribed on the opposite dna strand from the other members of the regulon. the bglc protein, a member of the xyls/arac family of transcriptional regulators, has been shown to be a positive regulator of the bgla gene, which encodes the phospho-beta-glucosidase  <cit> . this regulon has also been shown to display a glucose-resistant phenotype of catabolite repression  <cit> . this report now adds transcriptional regulation by antitermination to the list of interesting characteristics of this beta-glucoside-specific pts regulon from s. mutans.
