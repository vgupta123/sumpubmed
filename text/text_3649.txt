BACKGROUND
the human thymine-dna glycosylase  is part of the base-excision dna repair  machinery targeting g:u and g:t mispairs that did not arise due to replication errors. indeed, these mismatches frequently occur on double-stranded dna after spontaneous or catalytically-mediated hydrolysis of cytosine or c5-methylated cytosine leading to uracil and thymine, respectively  <cit> . among the large family of uracil-dna glycosylase enzymes, which initiate ber at g:u lesions, the subclass of tdg proteins exhibits a broader substrate specificity comprising recognition of erroneous thymine bases  <cit> . many in vitro enzymatic studies characterizing the catalysis parameters of tdg-mediated repair on various oligonucleotide substrates  <cit>  indicate that besides an evolutionary-conserved catalytic domain  <cit>  additional n- and c-terminal domains are responsible of this broader specificity of substrate recognition and processing  <cit>  with, as a counterpart, a lower enzymatic turnover  <cit> . a molecular rescue to this poor catalysis efficiency of tdg was found in the sumo modification of its c-terminus  <cit>  which helps to improve the turnover rate implying a molecular mechanism that competes with product inhibition  <cit> . indeed, the formation of a protruded Î±-helix within the catalytic domain upon sumo conjugation was proposed to facilitate the dna dissociation from the active site  <cit>  while the active site of tdg itself remains unchanged upon sumo- <dig> conjugation  <cit> . furthermore, a conformational change of the tdg n-terminal region, mimicking the deletion of the n-terminus, was proposed to explain the observed improvement of the enzymatic turnover on the g:u glycosylase reaction through a decrease of tdg's binding affinity for its dna substrates  <cit> . however, the structural and dynamic details of this hypothesis still remain to be established.

the evolutionary-acquired g:t mismatch specificity intriguingly relates tdg to the epigenetic regulation of transcription through dna methylation at cpg islands  <cit> . furthermore, functional interactions with the dna-methyltransferase dnmt3a were found to regulate the re-methylation of the newly reconstituted g:c canonical pair after tdg-mediated ber  <cit> . recently, tdg and dnmt3a were found to participate in a pattern of cyclic methylation of the tff <dig> promoter through their respective enzymatic activities  <cit> . furthermore, the tdg mismatch repair efficiency was shown to be compromised upon loss of dna methyltransferase expression and might require a yet unidentified rna component for full g:t repair activity  <cit> . tdg acts also as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptor transcription factors like the estrogen and the retinoic acid receptors  <cit> , and functionally interacts with other general hat coactivators like src- <dig> and cbp  <cit> . again, sumoylation of tdg was found to regulate tdg activity by abolishing interactions with cbp, preventing its cbp-mediated acetylation in vitro, and altering the sub-cellular localization of tdg to the pml oncogenic domains  <cit> .

covalent tdg sumoylation interferes with the intermolecular sumo- <dig> binding that is thought to be mediated by two distinct sumo-binding motifs located at the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the tdg catalytic core. the non-covalent sumo-binding capacity of tdg is also negatively affected by dna binding through the tdg n-terminal region  <cit> . it is this non-covalent sumo- <dig> binding which stimulates cbp-dependent transcriptional activation  <cit>  and is involved in tdg translocation to pml oncogenic domains, implicating its ability to bind sumoylated pml or other sumoylated proteins found within this nuclear compartment  <cit> .

for both sumo- <dig> conjugation and intermolecular sumo- <dig> binding, the n-terminal domain of tdg was found to be targeted in the modification of tdg function in ber. we have previously reported that the regulatory domain, located in the n-terminus of tdg , provides an additional non-sequence or mismatch specific dna binding activity and furthermore established dynamic intramolecular interactions with the core catalytic domain  <cit> . this interface is altered in the presence of a dna substrate. moreover, the conformation of the regulatory domain modulates the tdg glycosylase activity and enzymatic turnover in a mismatch-dependent manner  <cit> . here we describe the effects on the conformational dynamics of tdg, and in particular on the regulatory domain, of sumo- <dig> conjugation on the one hand and non-covalent sumo- <dig> binding on the other. the mechanism of stimulation of tdg glycosylase activity by sumo- <dig> is described.

RESULTS
sumo- <dig> conjugation to tdg affects the c-terminal domain conformation but not the n-terminal region of tdg
the uniformly 15n-labeled tdg protein conjugated on lysine  <dig> to sumo- <dig> was produced in e. coli as described  <cit> . the conjugation site was verified using as a negative control the tdg-k330a mutant under the same conditions for protein production. in this latter control case only the non-modified tdg-k330a protein was isolated after purification as checked by maldi-tof ms and denaturing gel electrophoresis . thus sumoylation of tdg under these conditions indeed only occurs on lysine  <dig> 

in our previous nmr study, we have shown that the tdg protein exhibits broad lines on the 15n-1h hsqc spectrum concerning the large majority of its residues and that only the n- and c-terminus resonances are detectable due to their high degree of flexibility in solution   <cit> . we have also shown critical conformational dynamics for the regulatory domain of the n-terminus . this region, coinciding with a functional domain implicated in specific g:t excision  <cit> , adopts a residual structure in the context of the isolated n-terminus and undergoes a dramatic conformational and dynamic change in the context of the entire protein leading to the disappearance/broadening of corresponding resonances. the disappearance of resonances was shown to be due to intramolecular rd/cat interactions  <cit> . as for the unconjugated tdg protein, the acquisition of a 15n-1h hsqc spectrum on sumo-modified tdg leads to the detection of random coil regions. only the 1- <dig> segment of the n-terminus and the extreme c-terminus display sufficiently sharp resonances . furthermore, also for sumo- <dig>  only some n-terminal resonances are observable while the major part of sumo- <dig> resonances are too broad to be detected, somewhat mimicking the nmr behavior of tdg-cat and tdg-rd domains . these data are consistent with the x-ray structure of tdg conjugated to sumo <dig> where tight associations between sumo- <dig> and tdg-cat through the c-terminal sbm were highlighted  <cit> . the resonances of the tdg n-terminal region  are not perturbed upon sumo-1-conjugation when compared to non-modified tdg protein. in contrast, the resonances of residues  <dig> to  <dig>  surrounding the k <dig> sumoylation site, are significantly broadened , indicating conformational modifications of the tdg c-terminus through covalent sumoylation and no remote perturbations of the n-terminal conformation. we cannot exclude, given the absence of detectable nmr signals that some conformational changes of the tdg regulatory and catalytic domains upon sumo- <dig> conjugation occur. note, however, that based on previous work a structural change of at least the tdg active site after sumo conjugation is rather unlikely  <cit> .

tdg/sumo- <dig> non-covalent interactions induce conformational changes within the n-terminal regulatory domain and the c-terminal region of tdg
it had previously been shown  that sumo- <dig> can interact with tdg also in a non-covalent manner through apparently two distinct binding sites  located within tdg-cat   <cit>  and  that the interactions of tdg with dna as well as sumoylation of tdg prevent further sumo- <dig> intermolecular interactions  <cit> . the non-covalent interactions with sumo- <dig> could be either implicated in the tdg sumoylation process itself - as intermediate states, or in functional interactions between tdg and other sumoylated proteins  <cit> . moreover, since sumo conjugation to tdg was shown to reduce its dna binding activity, which suggests when seen in context of previous works, a putative modification of the tdg n-terminal conformation  <cit> , we have investigated the intermolecular interactions between tdg and sumo- <dig> by nmr spectroscopy. in direct binding experiments, we have not detected chemical shift perturbations of the resonances of the isolated n-terminal domain  in the presence of a 3-fold excess of sumo- <dig> . these data confirm that there are no direct interactions between sumo- <dig> and the n-terminal domain of tdg. moreover, in 15n-labeled full-length tdg, the resonances of the regulatory domain  become partially detectable upon unlabeled sumo- <dig> addition  while no modification was detected for the first fifty n-terminal residues. we indeed show a number of new resonances on the 15n-1h hsqc spectrum of the 15n-labeled tdg protein in the presence of sumo- <dig>  that match very well with those of tgd-rd observed in the context of the isolated tdg n-terminus  indicating that sumo- <dig> produces a conformational change of tdg-rd upon binding to sbms. these resonances are of lower intensity as compared with those of the n <cit> 50]-terminal region suggesting a partial effect on tdg-rd conformation. an increase of rd resonances was measured when adding increasing amounts of sumo- <dig> over tdg . we were also able to detect a gradual decrease of signal intensities for some resonances of the tdg c-terminus  in presence of sumo- <dig>  which indicates a modification of the c-terminal dynamics and conformation upon sumo- <dig> intermolecular binding to sbms. remarkably, the non-covalent interaction of sumo- <dig> and the covalent sumo- <dig> modification of tdg induce a perturbation of the same tdg c-terminal resonances. this effect is obviously more pronounced for sumo- <dig> conjugation than for the non-covalent binding and leads to the only consistent interpretation that cis and trans sumo- <dig> target at least one identical region of tdg-cat: the c-terminal sumo-binding motif . to confirm this interaction, we have acquired a 15n-1h hsqc spectrum on 15n-labeled sumo- <dig> in presence of tdg. despite we observed some slight signal perturbations upon tdg addition it seems rather to be induced by weak, non-specific interactions . however, an overall 2-fold decrease of sumo- <dig> signal intensity in the presence of tdg was noticed with exception of its n-terminal residues  that remain unchanged . hence, the sumo- <dig> population bound to tdg cannot be detected on the 15n-1h hsqc spectrum of 15n-labeled sumo- <dig> as already observed for sumo- <dig> conjugated to tdg. only the remaining free sumo- <dig> molecules are detected. taken together, our data indicate that non-covalent interactions between sumo- <dig> and tdg exist, but do not directly involve the tdg n-terminus which is in accordance with previous studies  <cit> .

sumo- <dig> does not interact with tdg-e310q
having observed the importance of at least the c-terminal sbm also in the case of covalent sumoylation of tdg, we decided to further analyze the sumo- <dig> interaction sites within tdg-cat. since two sumo-binding motifs had been previously proposed, one at the amino- and another at the carboxy-terminal part of tdg-cat  <cit> , we wanted to determine which sbm mediates the n- and/or c-terminal conformational changes which we were able to detect by nmr. we have produced three sbm mutants by either mutating the sbm <dig>  or sbm <dig>  or both  similarly to mohan and co-workers  <cit> . the 15n-labeled proteins were initially analyzed by nmr and circular dichroism spectroscopy . our data show that the d133a mutation of the conserved divii sumo recognition sequence of the amino-terminal sbm  leads to a significant misfolding of the protein and consequent aggregation  and thus cannot be considered for further interaction studies with sumo- <dig>  such a misfolding could be assigned to the experimental conditions  or heterologous protein overexpression in e. coli but it is not observed, however, for wild-type tdg or the tdg-e310q mutant  that are produced and investigated under the same conditions. it should also be noticed that the ivii motif, with exception of the d <dig> residue, is not solvent-accessible in both the non- and sumo-modified tdg-cat structures   <cit> . while the d133a mutation indeed might lead to loss of sumo- <dig> binding as described in  <cit> , our data raise the possibility that loss of interaction could also be the result of a more general, unspecific effect of tdg misfolding in this part of the molecule and subsequent aggregation of tdg-d133a into high-molecular weight precipitates.

in contrast, the tdg-e310q mutant behaves as the tdg wild-type protein and few discrepancies were detectable in far-uv spectra obtained by circular dichroism  as well as on the hsqc resonances between both spectra . this is, given our previous analysis of tdg-cat nmr behavior  <cit> , explained by the fact that the mutated residue is part of the very rigid region not detected in the hsqc spectra. moreover, since few differences between mutant and wild type proteins are observed when comparing the hsqc spectra, we can reasonably assume that the e310q mutation does not, unlike the d133a mutation, strongly affect the structure of tdg.

we have further investigated the sumo- <dig> binding to tdg-e310q. under the same conditions used as for wild-type tdg, no modification of neither c-terminal nor rd resonances of tdg-e310q were detected in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of sumo- <dig>  indicating that  sumo- <dig> binding to tdg is abolished by the e310q mutation and  sumo- <dig> binding to the tdg c-terminal sbm is solely responsible for both the c- and n-terminal conformational changes. moreover, in contrast to wild-type tdg, the overall signal intensity of 15n-sumo- <dig> does not decrease in presence of a 3-fold excess of tdg-e310q , confirming that sumo- <dig> does not interact with tdg-e310q. furthermore, the cd spectra of tdg or tdg-e310q in presence of sumo- <dig> point to a slight modification of protein structures for the wild-type tdg only confirming the tdg/sumo- <dig> intermolecular interaction and subsequent structural rearrangement .

no competition between cis and trans sumo- <dig> for tdg-cat binding
interestingly, sumo- <dig> was also able to bind sbm <dig> in the context of sumoylated tdg . we have detected modifications of the c-terminal resonances of 15n-labeled sumoylated tdg when adding a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled sumo- <dig> as well as appearance of tdg-rd resonances similarly to unmodified tdg. however, except of sumo- <dig> resonances observable at natural abundance, no additional 15n-labeled sumo- <dig> signals coming from sumoylated tdg were detected indicating that sbm <dig> bound sumo- <dig> does not displace intramolecular sumo- <dig>  these data show that intermolecular sumo- <dig> binding does not fully compete with cis sumo- <dig> and that sbm <dig> remains accessible to sumo- <dig> interactions. based on these observations, we can speculate for a larger c-terminal sbm than the one that has been described  <cit> . additionally, the 15n-1h hsqc spectrum of the sumoylated tdg-e310q mutant shows no significant modification of tdg-e310q resonances and no sumo signals except the amino-terminal residues also detectable for the sumo-modified wild-type tdg . these data confirm the existence of distinct sumo interfaces for either cis or trans sumo- <dig> moieties.

taking together the structure of the sumo- <dig> modified tdg-cat protein and our nmr data, the sumo- <dig> conjugation rather acts on the tdg c-terminal conformation with no or little impact on the tdg-rd conformation. in contrast, the sumo- <dig> non-covalent binding to the c-terminal sbm is able to structurally modify both the n- and c-terminal regions of tdg and sumoylated tdg. based on the observations reported here, we conclude that sumo- <dig> does not adopt the same orientation as in the sumoylated protein. interestingly, sumo- <dig> non-covalent binding leads to a partial rd displacement from its cat interface indicating an effect of steric hindrance rather than overlapping binding interfaces on the cat domain which is in good agreement with our previous suggestion for the putative localization of the rd interface on the cat domain  <cit> .

sumo- <dig> does not interact with the c-terminal sbm in presence of dna
it has been shown that sumo- <dig> intermolecular binding is strongly reduced by tdg's association with dna  <cit> . given our previous results concerning tdg-rd/dna interactions  <cit> , we have examined the effect of dna heteroduplexes containing a g:u or a g:t mismatch on tdg conformation in the presence of sumo- <dig>  some weak additional resonances matching with those of the isolated tdg n-terminus bound to dna heteroduplexes are observed on the 15n-labeled tdg hsqc spectrum  suggesting that dna substrates containing either a normal g:c pair or a g:t/u mismatch  can displace similarly tdg-rd from its tdg-cat interacting surface . furthermore, no signal perturbation of tdg-rd or a328-a <dig> region was observed upon sumo- <dig> addition . these data indicate that a dna heteroduplex containing either a g:u or a g:t mismatch induces a conformational modification of tdg-rd, this effect being independent of sumo- <dig> being present or not, and prevents sumo- <dig> binding to the c-terminal sbm which is in accordance with previous works  <cit> . dna binding to tdg-cat likely modifies the sbm <dig> conformation or accessibility so that it prevents any sumo- <dig> interactions. we can not exclude that sumo- <dig> could modify the binding affinity of tdg to dna as it has been shown previously in an indirect manner  <cit> . however, given the dissociation constant of the tdg/dna complex  and the relatively high protein concentrations that must be used for nmr studies , the sumo-induced decrease of tdg/dna affinity  is not strong enough to be detected since, with a  <dig> Î¼m sample, tdg, and more particularly the rd, is still saturated with dna whether sumo is present or not.

sumo- <dig> stimulates the glycosylase activity of tdg and tdg-e310q
although intermolecular sumo- <dig> binding did not occur in presence of dna or with the c-terminal sbm mutation, we have observed a stimulation of the glycosylase activity of wild-type and e310q mutant tdg proteins. using a glycosylase assay, we have measured a slight increase of tdg and tdg-e310q activities and turnover rates upon sumoylation or sumo- <dig> addition on the g:t glycosylase reaction . in contrast, the g:u activities and enzymatic turnovers were very sensitive to sumoylation  or sumo- <dig> addition in a dose-dependent manner . we have measured a g:u turnover rate increased by a factor of  <dig>  for the sumoylated tdg as compared to the non-modified tdg, while a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increase was observed upon addition of  <dig> and  <dig> molar equivalents of sumo- <dig>  respectively . we have shown in control experiments that the non-covalent sumo- <dig> effect is highly specific as same amounts of bsa did not induce such a stimulation of tdg and sumoylated tdg glycosylase activities . furthermore, indeed, free sumo- <dig> can also further increase g:t and g:u processivity of sumoylated tdg unlike bsa . finally, the increase in activity of tdg that we postulated based on nmr experiments can be shown to take place under the same experimental conditions as the protein-protein and protein-dna interactions, that is in nmr buffer at ph  <dig>  . note that while tdg's processivity drops by almost an order of magnitude when using acidic buffers, however, the specific stimulation by sumoylation and free sumo- <dig> is clearly detectable and comparable to the one detected under standard experimental conditions . hence sumo- <dig>  similarly to the sumoylation of tdg, positively acts on the g:u glycosylase activity and also improves albeit weakly the g:t activity. hence, despite a disruption of sbm2/sumo- <dig> interactions in presence of dna or upon sbm <dig> mutation, sumo- <dig> was still able to activate tdg glycosylase activities on both g:t and g:u substrates in a dose-dependent manner suggesting an indirect mechanism where the tdg/sumo- <dig> interaction is not directly responsible for the up-regulation of glycosylase activity .

sumo- <dig> competes with tdg-rd for dna binding
since sumo- <dig> does not interact with the tdg c-terminal sbm upon sbm mutation or dna addition, it rather seems that sumo- <dig> acts indirectly on tdg activity by an unknown mechanism. we have thus investigated the ability of sumo- <dig> to directly interact with dna and shown a non-specific but detectable interaction using nmr spectroscopy and gel shift assays  <cit> . in this study, we have also demonstrated competition between sumo- <dig> and tdg-rd for dna binding with emsa.

here, we demonstrate the ability of sumo- <dig> to displace rd from dna in a direct competition experiment using nmr methodology. in presence of an equimolar amount of a double-stranded 25-mer dna substrate containing a g:t mismatch, some weak chemical shift perturbations of tdg-rd were observed and are more pronounced with a 4-fold molar excess of the same substrate . adding a 4-fold molar excess of sumo- <dig> to the equimolar tdg-n: dna mixture induces a shift of rd resonances towards those for the free rd. this effect concerns resonances for residues comprised in the region from position  <dig> to  <dig>  indicating a partial competition of sumo- <dig> with the rd for dna binding . for the n- and c-terminal parts of tdg-rd, no competition was observed. since the tdg-rd has a weak, non-sequence specific dna binding activity  <cit>  that contributes to reinforce tdg binding to dna at the expense of the enzymatic turnover, a partial competition between sumo- <dig> and tdg-rd could therefore sufficiently destabilize the tdg/dna complex with, as a consequence, an increase of g:t/u turnover. given the relatively low affinity of tdg-n for dna , a substantial amount of free dna  is found within the equimolar tdg-n: dna mixture possibly leading to many unproductive  sumo-1: dna complexes. in the context of the entire tdg, as the presence of a sbm will favor the recruitment of sumo- <dig> leading to a significant increase of its local concentration in the near vicinity of rd, the competition between sumo- <dig> and rd might be more pronounced. we have shown that such a competitive mechanism is indeed feasible  <cit> .

discussion
we have found that the posttranslational modification of tdg by sumo- <dig>  has no detectable effect on the conformational dynamics of the regulatory domain and rather acts on the tdg-cat  <cit>  and tdg c-terminal conformations  and  stimulates both g:t and g:u glycosylase activities with a more pronounced effect on g:u substrates . it has been shown that sumo- <dig> covalent attachment to tdg results in a destabilization of the tdg/dna complex leading to increased tdg turnover  <cit> . it has been proposed that sumo- <dig> conjugation by mimicking the effect of n-terminal domain truncation on the tdg glycosylase turnover rates could induce long-range conformational changes on this tdg n-terminal domain  <cit> . however, no modification of the n-terminal conformation was detected on full-length tdg conjugated to sumo- <dig> by nmr spectroscopy. in contrast, the sumo- <dig> non-covalent interaction through a unique sbm localized at the c-terminal region of tdg-cat  competes with the tdg regulatory domain for the binding to the catalytic domain. sumo- <dig> thereby is able to partially displace the regulatory domain from the rd/cat interface leading to a "primed" extended conformation of tdg-rd  which preserves a sequence-independent dna binding activity  as previously observed  <cit> . furthermore, since a modification of the c-terminus conformation has been observed resembling the effect of covalent sumo- <dig> modification , it was possible to show that the intermolecular binding of sumo- <dig> induces the same modification of the tdg-cat structure. moreover, we have demonstrated that both n- and c-terminal conformational modifications were only induced by sumo- <dig> binding to the c-terminal sbm  and intermolecular sumo- <dig> binding still occur in the context of sumoylated tdg.

similarly to a dna substrate containing a normal g:c pair  <cit> , dna containing a g:t/u mismatch alters the rd/cat interface and stabilizes the rd extended conformer . the rd in its extended conformation interacts with dna in a sequence-independent manner. such interactions preserve the rd/dna contacts essential for the g:t processing while the rd/cat interactions contributes to decrease the g:t/u turnover rates  <cit> . remarkably, sumo- <dig> does not modify the rd conformational equilibrium in the presence of dna and apparently does not interact with tdg in presence of dna . however, sumo- <dig> stimulates the tdg glycosylase activity in a concentration-dependent manner on both g:t and g:u mismatches. also, with the tdg-e310q sbm <dig> mutant, the stimulation effect of sumo- <dig> on tdg-e310q activity can still be observed for g:t/u substrates . while our data show that the sbm <dig> motif is highly unlikely to be functional for sumo binding due to it being buried inside the hydrophobic core of the cat domain, and given the absence of any chemical shift perturbations in nmr experiments using tdg-e310q in the presence of sumo, we demonstrate that the effect on the ber activity of tdg is independent of sumo binding to tdg. it is likely that sumo- <dig> facilitates the tdg/dna dissociation by competing with tdg-rd for dna binding, as we have shown weak, but significant non-sequence specific interactions of sumo- <dig> with dna duplexes. indeed, the molecular contacts of tdg-rd with dna stabilize the tdg/dna complex leading to a tight association of dna and a poor turnover rate  <cit> . sumo- <dig> by competing with tdg-rd for dna binding would destabilize the tdg/dna complex and thus salvage tdg activity . the rd/sumo- <dig> competition has little incidence on the g:t excision but significantly increases the g:u activity and turnover rate in a sumo- <dig> concentration-dependent manner, thereby mimicking sumo- <dig> conjugation. interestingly, sumo conjugation was already found to negatively regulate the dna binding activity of the transcription factor hsf <dig> in a way that could resemble the non-specific binding we describe here  <cit> . in the binding experiments we have performed, a large excess of free sumo- <dig> was used in order to compete with either the intramolecular sumo- <dig> in the sumoylated proteins or the tdg-rd, which is by nature covalently bound to tdg-cat. in both cases, we have to take into account the concentration effect of sumo- <dig> or tdg-rd due to covalent attachment. to compete with such high local concentrations, a significant excess of free sumo- <dig> has to be employed in the competition or ber experiments. note however that in our experiments quantitatively sumo- <dig> modified proteins were used which does not necessarily reflect the situation in the cell where low levels of sumoylation that are detected within the cell   <cit> . therefore, very distinct effects should be observed with free sumo- <dig> on the one hand and covalently attached sumo- <dig> on the other.

interestingly, whether the sumoylation of tdg, its intermolecular interaction with sumo- <dig> or both is implicated in the regulation of its function in vivo is still not clear. sumo-mediated interactions of tdg with sumo-modified proteins could also modulate tdg activity on dna repair, in a manner similar to the sumoylation of tdg itself. it has been shown that sumo- <dig> binding activity of tdg is essential for cbp activation and localization to promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domains  <cit> . in contrast with the sumo- <dig> conjugation, the non-covalent sumo- <dig> binding can act in a concentration-dependent manner and would be a more flexible way to regulate tdg glycosylase activity in a sense that it does not require the recruitment of the sumoylation  and de-sumoylation machinery  <cit> . sumo- <dig> concentrations in a particular nuclear compartment be it free or conjugated to another protein, could hence result in fine tuning of tdg functions, similar to mechanisms proposed for other sumoylated or sumo- <dig> binding proteins  <cit> . it has been proposed that, due to small protein-protein interfaces between sumo- <dig> and sbm, this interaction falls within the high micromolar range. high affinities could further result from binding to a sumoylated protein through both a sbm and a second low-affinity interaction site  <cit> .

furthermore, sumo- <dig> intermolecular binding could have another function like modifying the tdg interface for its cellular partners, more particularly the rd accessibility, as already described for sumo conjugation to a transcription factor  <cit>  not for sumo non-covalent binding. a number of studies have pointed to a central role of the rd in mediating protein-protein interactions  <cit> . a sumo-induced conformational change of the rd therefore implies a modification of the molecular interactions not only between the latter and tdg's substrates but also its interaction partners . among them is the creb binding protein , which could be a target of the sumo-induced rd conformational changes. indeed, cbp is sumoylated on three lysine residues located in a region close to the hat domain and mediates acetylation at four positions within the rd through its acetyltransferase activity. a dual interacting surface, sbm/sumo- <dig> on one hand and rd/hat on the other, leading to a high affinity complex, would involve the sumo- <dig> activity of tdg not only for interaction with sumoylated cbp but in modifying the tdg-rd structure in a conformation more favorable to cbp interaction and subsequent acetylation. consistent with this, the stimulation of cbp-mediated transcription by sumo- <dig> binding indicates a possible role of the rd conformational dynamics in the regulation of tdg/cbp interactions  <cit> . it would be now interesting to investigate at the molecular level whether the rd conformational changes we have observed with free sumo- <dig> are reproducible with a sumoylated protein and whether this sumo- <dig> binding activity stimulates the interaction.

finally, a model in which sumoylation or sumo- <dig> binding to tdg occurs only once tdg has performed the glycosylase reaction and remains, due to the poor product dissociation rate, trapped on the abasic g:- site would also be consistent with all the experimental evidence available today. in this case sumoylation or sumo- <dig> interactions would indeed constitute a salvage pathway removing tdg from lesions in order to allow repair to proceed. such a mechanism might also explain why sumo conjugating enzymes seem systematically associated with different dna repair complexes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
sumo- <dig> increases the enzymatic turnover of tdg by overcoming the product-inhibition of tdg on apurinic sites. the mechanism involves a competitive dna binding activity of sumo- <dig> towards the regulatory domain of tdg. this mechanism might be a general feature of sumo- <dig> regulation of other dna-bound factors such as transcription regulatory proteins. the fact that sumo- <dig> can interact with dna in a non-sequence specific manner has broader implications for the role of sumo in dna repair and transcription regulation. several so-far intriguing observations of sumo activity in both processes  <cit>  might find similar explanations of dna binding competition or allosteric regulation through sumo-modified dna interaction properties.
