BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas  are involved in the majority of biological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and development . moreover, the majority of human genes are regulated by mirnas. not surprisingly, mirnas also play a crucial role in pathogenic processes.

in the beginning of mirna research mostly tissue has been in the focus of research, thus for all human tissue types specific profiles have been discovered, e.g. from patients with lung cancer  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit>  or glioblastoma  <cit> . more recently body fluids as source for non-invasive or minimal-invasive markers have become more important. besides serum , one of the most frequently applied approaches remains to measure mirnas from whole blood . as mirnas are known to be very specific for different tissues, they are likewise known to be specific for different compounds of the blood. the respective knowledge on the origin of blood-borne mirna patterns has however been hardly considered.

in our study we aimed to provide mirnomes for common compounds of the human blood, including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> positive cells and exosomes. for all samples we also provided the measurement of whole blood using paxgene tubes as comparison. in a first stage, we measured the mirna repertoire for each cell type and whole blood for two individuals at three time points  in order to get an estimation how stable cell type specific mirnomes are over time. here, we detected a very high reproducibility and stability for all tested cell types.

in a second stage we extended the measurement to  <dig> individuals in order to understand the complexity and variability of cell type specific mirnomes. our results showed that the cell type mirnomes are highly specific but comparably constant between different individuals. thus, our study represents a standard repertoire of mirnas in the considered cell types.

RESULTS
stability of the human blood compound mirnomes
a central question of our study was how reproducible and reliable can mirnomes of individuals be measured. to this end we picked one male and one female individual and collected blood at three time points: t <dig>  t <dig>  which was one year after t <dig> and t <dig>  which was one day after t <dig>  blood cell type extraction and detection of the respective mirnomes was done immediately after blood collection. this set-up allows us to test for the reproducibility of cell type specific mirnomes over a very short period of time but at the same time offers to report the stability of the mirna repertoire in individuals over a longer period.

for measurements repeated within 24 hours we found on average a high correlation of  <dig> , indicating a reasonable reproducibility of the blood collection, cell type separation and mirna profiling approach. astonishingly, profiles correlated even after one year still very well. on average, pearson correlation was as high as  <dig> , demonstrating the enormous stability of the cell type specific mirnomes over a longer period of time.

considering the two consecutive time points, the highest correlation for a specific cell type was reached by cd <dig> positive cells, exceeding  <dig> . just cd <dig> positive cells reached almost the same level of reproducibility. a similar behavior was also observed for the correlation within cell types in general. here, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells reached correlation of  <dig> , cd <dig> positive cells and paxgene whole blood reached average correlation of  <dig> , cd <dig> positive cells showed lowest but still substantial correlation of  <dig> .to understand how the different cell populations are related to each other we applied hierarchical clustering on the  <dig> most variable mirnas. as the dendrogram in figure  <dig> presents, different cell types cluster perfectly to each other. paxgene blood shows the most different patterns, cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells clustered well together as well as cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells. notably, for paxgene blood and cd <dig> positive cells, individuals likewise cluster together. regarding the three time points we just observed a tendency of the latter two time points to cluster well together, again demonstrating the high stability of blood cell type specific mirnomes over a longer period of time.figure  <dig>

complexity and specificity of cell type specific mirnomes
in order to improve our understanding of the complexity and specificity of cell type mirnomes we extended our cohort to  <dig> unaffected individuals and measured the same cell fractions. the bar diagram in figure  <dig> presents the average number of detected mirnas per cell fraction. while cd <dig> positive cells showed the most complex mirnome consisting of as much as  <dig> of the measured  <dig>  markers, we detected significantly less mirnas  in cd <dig> positive cells. cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells showed comparable number of mirnas with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> detected mirnas on average. the respective mirnomes per cell fraction are available in supplemental table  <dig> based on the different complexity in mirnome we concluded that the respective profiles as such may also show a high degree of variability. to validate this hypothesis we focused on the mirnas with highest variance among all cell types and calculated the expression as percentage of average expression over all cell types for each mirna. as the spider diagram and heatmap in figure  <dig> detail, we discovered  <dig> mirnas being significantly higher expressed in cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells as compared to cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells: mir- <dig>  mir-342-5p, mir-146a, mir-342-3p, mir- <dig> and mir-151-5p.  <dig> mirnas showed the opposite behavior: mir-223*, mir-199b-5p, mir-582-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-338-3p and mir- <dig>  these results are in line with our initial findings on the two individuals measured over 1 year, overall cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells have similar patterns as well as cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells. however, we also detect mirnas that are highly expressed just in single cell types, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-3663-3p for cd <dig> positive cells. vice versa, mir- <dig> and mir-181b are over expressed in cd <dig> positive cells and show significantly decreased expression in cd <dig> positive cells.figure  <dig>

the mirnome profile of exosomes
besides measuring whole mirnome profiles from different tissues or body fluids like whole blood, serum or urine, mirna profiles of exosomes that are released by cells and circulate in body fluids become likewise more central for current research. thus, we also extracted exosomes from serum of the same two individuals at t <dig> and t <dig> and measured the respective exosome mirnomes. repeated extraction of exosomes of the same individuals correlated well to each other, on average, pearson correlation was above  <dig> . while this still represents a reasonable stability of exosome profiles, the values were clearly below measurements for the different cell types, corresponding to a higher variability of mirnas in exosomes.altogether, we found just a small number of mirnas being expressed in these microvesicles. on average,  <dig> mirnas were detected, a number well below the average number of detected mirnas in the different analyzed blood cell types from the same blood donors. despite the lower complexity of exosome mirna profiles we searched for mirnas being present just in exosomes while not in any other cell fraction. indeed, we detected markers present at least in two different exosome measurements while not in any blood cell type or whole blood of the same individuals. the respective  <dig> markers include hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-32*, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-877*, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-3680*, hsa-mir-193b*, hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir-1228* .

family and function of blood cell compound mirnas
in order to find potentially enriched mirna families or clusters as well as biological functions we used the freely available tam tool  <cit> . specifically, we analyzed all mirnas for each blood compound that has been detected at least in  <dig> measurements. our analysis revealed that in many cases specific mirna families are enriched in selected cell types, for cd <dig> positive cells, mir-106a cluster was significant while for cd <dig> positive cells mir-106b cluster was found to be enriched. interestingly, mir- <dig> cluster was significant for all cell types but not for exosomes. the same holds for the akt pathway, cell proliferation, apoptosis, granulopoiesis and others. most interestingly, mirna tumor suppressors were enriched in all categories besides exomes, however, in the case of onco-mirnas, exosomes became likewise significant. all results are summarized in table  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
while for gene expression various studies have been carried out in order to systematically explore patterns in different cell types, for mirnas few studies have been published  <cit> . as an example, yu and co-workers demonstrated that positive and negative selection do not have a significant influence of the mirna pattern  <cit> . in order to reduce the risk of contamination with other cells and to reach high purity of the isolated cell fractions we decided to apply positive cell selection. in two stages we then systematically explored the specific mirnomes of  <dig> cell fractions including cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  we also performed profiling of the same individuals using paxgene blood tubes, representing one of the gold standard approaches for detecting circulating disease markers for various human pathologies. even more importantly, we likewise generated profiles from exosomes of the respective individuals.

in summary our study reveals that 1) mirna patterns of specific compounds of human blood can be reliably measured and are stable even over the course of one year; 2) the different cell types show substantial differences with respect to the complexity of their respective mirnomes; 3) cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells have a common myeloid progenitor and show a similar expression pattern, likewise cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive cells  are generally related to each other; 4) exosomes show a less complex and more variable mirna profile as compared to other cell types.
