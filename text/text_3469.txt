BACKGROUND
genetic variation is a major driving force in the evolution of organism. in individuals, specific genetic mutations such as snps can be deleterious and cause disease. the human genome project has yielded massive amounts of data on human snps, and this information can be used to further investigate human diseases. it is estimated that the human genome contains  <dig> million snp sites  <cit> . as a major repository of human snps, the ncbi dbsnp database  <cit>  contains ~ <dig> million human entries in the release of build  <dig>  the annotation of single nucleotide polymorphisms  is attracting a great deal of attention. non-synonymous snps , also referred to as single amino acid polymorphisms , are snps that cause amino acid substitutions, and these are believed to be directly related to diseases. thus far, only a small proportion of saps has been associated with disease. to date, ~ <dig>  non-synonymous snps are available with explicit annotation in the swiss-prot database  <cit> . therefore, it is desirable to develop effective methods for identifying disease-related amino acid substitutions <cit> .

several computational models have been developed for this purpose. evolutionary information is commonly considered to be the most important feature for such a prediction task. based on sequence homology, an earliest predictor sift was developed by ng and henikoff  <cit> . the panther database was designed based on family hidden markov models  to determine the likelihood of affecting protein function  <cit> . polyphen  <cit>  showed that the selection pressure against deleterious snps depended on the molecular function of the proteins. sequence/structural attributions were also incorporated in many studies. satisfactory results were obtained by ferrer-costa  <cit>  using mutation matrices, amino acid properties, and sequence potentials. by using attributions derived from other tools, an automated computational pipeline was constructed to annotate disease-associated nssnps  <cit> . many other models have been developed based on this combination strategy  <cit> . saunders and baker evaluated the contributions of several structural features and evolutionary information in predicting deleterious mutations  <cit> . wang and moult undertook a detailed investigation of snps in which they studied the effects of the mutations on molecular function  <cit> . recently, mort et al.,  <cit>  li et al.,  <cit>  and carter et al.  <cit>  functionally profiled human amino acid substitutions. they found a significant difference between deleterious and polymorphic variants in terms of both structural and functional disruption. yue et al.  <cit>  performed comprehensive studies on the impact of single amino acid substitutions on protein structure and stability. in these studies, stability change was also regarded as an important factor that contributed to dysfunction. detailed studies were carried out by reumers et al.,  <cit>  and bromberg et al.  <cit>  in which the extent of the functional effect of a mutation was correlated to its effect on protein stability.

wang et al.,  <cit>  and yue et al.  <cit>  showed that the functional impacts of a mutation are closely related to its protein structural context. recently, alexander et al.  <cit>  showed how the fold and function of a protein is altered by mutations. they observed a conformational switch between two different folds triggered by a single amino acid substitution, which directly proved the dependence of protein structure and function on amino acid interactions. therefore, the challenge that is faced, especially when there is a lack of annotations on the functional role of a residue, is how to incorporate such useful features for detecting disease-associated mutations. to resolve this, in our study a complex network was employed to depict protein structure.

owing to their potential for systematic analysis, complex networks have been widely used in proteomics. this method can also be used to represent a protein structure as a network  in which the vertices are the residues and the edges are their interactions. this provides novel insight into protein folding mechanisms, stability, and function. greene et al., and bagler et al. described the small-world and even scale-free  <cit>  properties of such network, which were independent of the protein structural class  <cit> . vendruscolo et al., and dokholyan et al. determined that a limited set of hub vertices with large connectivity plays a key role in protein folding  <cit> . in another study, hubs were defined as residues with more than four links, and these brought together different secondary structure elements that contributed to both protein folding and stability  <cit> . all these studies suggest that protein structure network  facilitates the systematic analysis of residue interactions both locally and globally. psn also has the advantage of capturing the role of a residue in protein structure and function.

using this information, cheng et al. developed a solely structure-based approach named bongo to predict disease-associated saps  <cit>  and obtained a satisfactory positive predictive value. their study emphasized that the functional essentiality of a site is closely correlated to its role in maintaining protein structure. their study showed that psn should be capable of detecting polymorphic mutations. however, their method performed poorly in detecting disease-associated mutations, which was believed to be due to the inability of bongo to identify functional roles of the residue. in this study, we demonstrated that psn can also perform well in predicting disease-associated mutations.

we carried out a comprehensive analysis on the network properties of mutations by using a dataset compiled from swiss-prot. we tried to determine how disease-associated variants differ from polymorphism variants in terms of network topological features. four well-established network topological features, degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness, and closeness, were calculated based on protein structure networks and used to predict disease-associated saps. the neighborhood of the mutation was also investigated. these features offer a quantitative description of residue interactions. we compared their performance with that of conservation features. finally, a model was constructed to predict disease-associated saps by combining network topological, conservation, and properties of neighboring residues around a mutation  as well as several features reported in previous studies. the satisfactory performance suggested that studying residue interactions can help to distinguish disease-associated saps from polymorphic saps.

RESULTS
analysis of topological features for disease-associated and polymorphic saps
four well-established network topological features, degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness, and closeness--were used to characterize disease-associated saps. first, an analysis was carried out to determine the extent to which disease-associated and polymorphic saps differ in terms of such topological features.

comparing network topological features with conservation features
conservation features are considered to be the most important features for predicting disease-associated saps. therefore, we compared the performance of topological features, as well as environmental features with widely used conservation features in predicting disease-associated saps. three feature sets were constructed: a conservation feature set , topological feature set  and neighboring environmental feature set . here, f-set  <dig> comprises seven elements: position-specific scores and observed percentages for the wild-type and variant residues, changes in these two measures upon mutation, and the conservation score. moreover, f-set  <dig> consists of the four topological features mentioned above, which are derived from the wild-type protein structure. finally, f-set  <dig> consists of topological features and the conservation scores of the five most conserved neighboring residues around the sap under study.

these three feature sets were separately used to construct prediction models based on the random forest algorithm. details of their performances are listed in table  <dig>  by using the conservation feature set, acc and mcc values of  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively, were achieved. it is noteworthy that the sensitivity always appears to be better than the specificity. this is probably caused by the unbalanced ratios of disease-associated saps to polymorphic saps, as well as by the complexity of the cause of disease  <cit> . a sensitivity of ~80% suggests that conservation features can properly reflect the fragility of a residue to substitution. in the case of f-set  <dig>  acc and mcc were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. using f-set  <dig>  an acc and mcc values of  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively, were achieved. this shows that network-based neighboring residues can properly reflect the environment around an sap.

feature evaluation
previous studies have shown that several features, such as solvent accessible area, probability of the substitution according to pam <dig>  aggregation propensities, and histocompatibility leukocyte antigen  family can discriminate disease-associated saps from polymorphic saps <cit> . hence, further analysis of feature importance was performed by employing the feature estimation module in the random forest package in r. as shown in figure  <dig>  the feature hla family has the highest score, which is consistent with that reported by ye et al.  <cit> . conservation features expectedly exhibited high scores. scores for the frequency difference and pssm score difference between wild-type and variant residues were notably higher than those for these two features themselves. this indicates that a position would tolerate alteration between similar residues without having a marked influence on the local structure. interestingly, the score of closeness is not higher than that of betweenness, although the results from our above analysis showed a significant difference in its distribution between disease-associated saps and polymorphic saps. as reported earlier  <cit> , this feature is well correlated with conservations and could be the reason for its performance in this step. the environmental features were observed informative for the prediction, of which the closeness and conservation were even top ranked. this suggests that interactions between residues are crucial for the protein structure. moreover, it was also observed that the topologically important neighbors would be more conserved. in this sense, these network-based features can reflect the structural/functional importance of residues.

performance of our model for prediction of disease-associated saps
using all the features, we constructed a model to predict disease-associated saps based on a random forest algorithm. acc and mcc values of  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively, were achieved using this method with 5-fold cross-validation . the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. when using the top-ranked  <dig> features in the last evaluation step , the performance would be slightly improved. the acc reached  <dig> % while the sensitivity improved by ~ <dig> %. for further evaluation, an independent dataset was used to test the method . the sensitivity and specificity were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, when all features were used. the corresponding acc and mcc values were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. for the 37-feature set, a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % were achieved. the corresponding acc and mcc values were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. we also tried the support vector machine algorithm on our dataset, which gave a lower performance .

sift, polyphen- <dig>  bongo and sapred, four well established methods, were used for benchmarking. with our independent dataset, sift  <cit>  yielded a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % while polyphen- <dig> yielded a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % . bongo achieved a low sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %, which were similar with the results reported by cheng et al.  <cit> . using the dataset compiled by ye et al.  <cit> , our method achieved a sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> % . the corresponding acc and mcc were  <dig> % and  <dig> , respectively. sapred achieved a higher sensitivity of  <dig> % and a lower specificity of  <dig> %. it yielded an acc of  <dig> % and mcc of  <dig> . it should be noted that in this study, network features were introduced to depict an sap instead of conventional structural features such as nearby functional sites, secondary structure, and hydrogen bonds. the satisfactory performance suggests that network features also include the information provided by structural features and this method can complement to the existing methods for predicting disease-associated saps.

discussion
from a biological viewpoint, mutual restraint of residues is crucial for the correct functioning of a proper structure <cit> . network topological features were adopted in the present study to describe both local and global residue interactions: degree and clustering coefficient were used for the former, and closeness and betweenness were used for the later. this can be understood from the fundamental aspects of protein structure. a special local structure is usually maintained by the cooperation of several residues. in this case, residues with more neighbors would naturally be more crucial in residue interactions  <cit> , which would exert a greater influence on the local structure. in this sense, the frangibility upon residue substitution may be related to the density of the local structure. in biology, high betweenness is expected in the case of key residues that acting as a bridge in protein structure <cit> , such as those that bring together two different secondary structures. it was reported that closeness could indicate the functional role of a residue <cit> . so, it is not surprising that high closeness values were observed for disease-associated saps. it is therefore reasonable to use these features to depict the structural/functional role of a residue.

moreover, it was observed that the topologically important neighbors would likely be more conserved. it would be reasonable to expect that an sap close to structural/functional key residues would more likely to be associated with diseases. this is why several studies have designed features to indicate the distance of an sap to the function site  <cit> . in this sense, these network-based environmental features can depict the environment an sap lies in.

we also compared network features with widely used conservation features. in contrast to conservation features, network features characterize the sap in such a manner that its interactions with other residues in local/global protein structure are revealed. the performance of these features further proves their ability to distinguish disease-associated saps from polymorphic saps from the viewpoint of the roles of the focused residues in proteins. moreover, the performance of the environmental feature set demonstrates that a dysfunctional mutation is closely correlated to the environment it lies in.

we compared our method with several well established approaches. the satisfactory performance of our method suggests that network features indicate the importance of a position in the context of the entire protein. it is therefore reasonable to believe that studying saps by analyzing residue interactions in a protein is both feasible and promising.

CONCLUSIONS
residues are in contact with each other, but their positions and conformations are restricted to ensure the maintenance of proper structure and function. here, we represented a protein structure as a network, which allowed us to study the correlation between residues. our results suggest that network topological features can appropriately reflect the role of a disease-associated sap in both local and global structures by exploiting its correlation with other residues in a protein. the good performance obtained with the environmental feature set proves the feasibility of our method in detecting a disease-associated sap by investigating the properties of its neighboring residues.

several types of interactions are involved in a protein structure, including hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, van der waal and electrostatic interactions. these may play specific roles in maintaining protein structure or function. it is still a challenge to feature such interactions in a protein structure network, although psn has exhibited its advantage in revealing correlations between residues. it is anticipated that a psn with more refined residue interactions should accurately reflect the structural/functional role of a residue in a protein. we will conduct further analysis in our future studies.
