BACKGROUND
many genome-wide high throughput yeast two-hybrid analyses have generated ppi datasets for various model organisms. moreover, systematic manual curation of human protein interactomes, including biogrid  <cit> , mips  <cit> , intact  <cit> , pindb  <cit> , dip  <cit> , hprd  <cit>  and mint  <cit> , has also generated significant, but far from complete, datasets. therefore, in addition to an empirical screening of the interacting proteins of a given target, a comparative strategy should further facilitate functional annotation of uncharacterized proteins.

using our knowledge of conserved interactions in other organisms   <cit>  to elucidate the interacting networks of a particular target protein, we have previously established a publicly accessible and functional database, point   <cit> . the application of a similar concept and the addition of further filtering criteria have recently been reported and, as a result, have produced many outstanding studies such as ulysses  <cit> , ophid  <cit>  and homomint  <cit> . recently, additional high-throughput yeast two-hybrid experiments have generated an enormous number of human ppis  <cit> , which now require assessments of their accuracy  <cit>  and further evaluations using the concept of interologs. conversely, interologs may be used to estimate the reliability of high throughput observations.

it is expected that the interactions between conserved orthologs, which are conserved genes and gene products in different species, will be conserved as well. however, accurate human interolog predictions inferred from different species are much less abundant than expected  <cit> . additionally, some argue that interologs are less conserved than orthologs  <cit> . the extent to which ortholog-based ppi predictions can be applied has not been extensively analyzed.

in this work, orthologous pairs from  <dig> eukaryotic species have been expanded. using experimental ppis, interologs for these  <dig> species can be predicted and analyzed. this concept has been applied to host-pathogen ppi predictions. an analysis of predicted h. sapiens-p. falciparum interactions revealed ppis that are highly related to the maintenance of ca2+ levels in host cells. when comparing this method to other prediction methods, we find that this approach can complement bayesian statistical methods  <cit>  and structure-based methods  <cit> .

RESULTS
orthologs shared by h. sapiens and other model organisms
the complete ortholog matrix from  <dig> eukaryotic species is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  for brevity, only the orthologs between h. sapiens and five common model organisms are presented . these orthologs were based on the homologene database. interologs were determined from the model organisms m. musculus , r. norvegicus , d. melanogaster , c. elegans  and s. cerevisiae .

athese species are ranked by the number of genes with ortholog information available.

bthe percentage below the number of ortholog refers to the coverage on the species given in the left most column.

based on ortholog information, the conservation of genes and ortholog groups among  <dig> eukaryotic species were identified. we found  <dig> genes that were conserved in all  <dig> species presented in homologene , suggesting that these genes are fundamental and/or vital to eukaryotes. interestingly,  <dig> genes are missing in p. falciparum, but found in the other  <dig> species, including members of the proteosome, various atp synthases and many mitochondria-related genes. while most species in the homologene database share a high proportion of orthologs with other species , less than 20% of the  <dig>  genes in p. falciparum can be grouped with genes from other species. this suggests that the lifestyle and biological processes of this parasite deviate from those of other organisms.

ppis in the point database
ppis from the various model organisms were used to infer ppis  in higher order organisms such as h. sapiens. because experimental ppis from the target organisms are needed to verify these inferred ppis, collections of ppis are essential for an ortholog-based approach. the point database has collected most of the available public ppi data for a range of organisms . it contains more than  <dig>  human ppis with available ortholog information. in addition, more than  <dig>  yeast interactions are available, suggesting that a considerable number of human interologs can be inferred. most of these interactions were obtained from high-throughput techniques such as yeast two-hybrid screening, which is prone to a high rate of false positives and other errors. within the high-confidence dataset, where only ppis verified by two or more methods or reported in the literature two or more times are included, there are  <dig>  human ppis and  <dig>  yeast ppis with available ortholog information.

a these species are ranked by the number of available ppis, except for others and inter-species.

b orthologous group ppis are ppis with ortholog information available.

while the use of high-confidence ppis eliminates many potential ppis that are present in the available datasets, this trimming process reduces the false positive rate. among the organisms listed in table  <dig>  s. cerevisiae shows the most dramatic drop in the number of ppis when only high-confidence ppis are selected. the reason for this is obvious: this species is a single cell organism. most of the ppi datasets were obtained using high-throughput approaches, and have not been verified by other methods or reported independently in the literature. for h. sapiens, the number of high-confidence ppis exceeds even those of yeast. however, some species in the homologene database do not have ppi data available. for example, p. troglodytes  and c. familiaris  have no inferred human interologs despite the large number of orthologs they share with h. sapiens.

interologs inferred from ortholog pairs
given n objects in an undirected network , there will be n/ <dig> relationships among these n objects and n*n relationships for a directed network. since there are  <dig>  human ortholog groups , we therefore can assume that there are  <dig> */ <dig> pairwise interactions among these gene products. certainly, a complete graph is not reasonable or biologically feasible. however, we can assume that each interaction can be associated with a probability and that the probability for a non-interacting pair will be  <dig>  at this stage, we do not have enough information to assign a probability for each theoretical interaction. however, we can expand all  <dig> , <dig> interactions among these  <dig>  orthologous groups.

the interologs were inferred from ortholog information. using the orthologous groups shared by humans and other species, we can obtain the maximum number of interologs from currently available interactomes. only two orthologous groups shared by more than two species can be used to infer interologs. for example, if orthologous group a is shared by humans and mice, and orthologous group b is also shared by humans and mice, there will be a potential interolog a-b between humans and mice, although the probabilities associated with these two interactions  are not known.

based on this assumption, we analyzed a number of orthologous group pairs and identified a number of species sharing these orthologous groups for h. sapiens . among the  <dig> , <dig> interactions,  <dig> , <dig> interologs were inferred from ortholog information. this translates to  <dig> % coverage of interologs . although the theoretical interolog coverage is high , the interolog coverage on currently available ppis is not significant. for all available human ppis, only  <dig> / <dig>  interactions  can be inferred from known interactions in other model organisms. using the trimmed set of high-confidence ppis, this coverage drops to  <dig> % . there is an obvious gap between the theoretical upper boundary and the experimentally observed data.

to investigate the origin of this gap, we further analyzed the interolog coverage of each model organism. five common model organisms were selected. the number of inferable interologs, experimental ppi derived interologs and their interolog coverage were calculated . it is interesting that the most commonly used model organism, s. cerevisiae , has a theoretical interolog coverage of only  <dig> % , whereas the ichsa of m. musculus  and r. norvegicus  are larger by two-orders of magnitude. however, for experimental human ppis, the ichsa of mouse is only 2-fold higher than that of yeast, and the ichsa of rat is lower than that of yeast. the species contributions, csp, shown in this table are also informative. while mouse contributes  <dig> % of the known interologs, yeast contributes only  <dig> %. this trend was mostly unchanged for high-confidence ppis, except the contribution of yeast was boosted to  <dig> %.

the mapping of all orthologous group pairs permits interolog prediction for various eukaryotic species. for example, in the poinet web service , interologs can be inferred for seven eukaryotic species . currently, more than  <dig>  human interologs can be inferred. among them,  <dig>  have been confirmed by experimental evidence. the continual growth of interactomes in every eukaryotic species will continue to improve the ability to predict interologs.

prediction of inter-species host-pathogen interactions
p. falciparum is a parasite with a complex life cycle, and this malarial parasite threatens millions of lives worldwide. based on the homologene database, p. falciparum has the least similar genome in comparison to other species. only roughly 20%  of the genes share orthologous groups with other organisms. this suggests that many cellular processes vital to other eukaryotes may be missing or replaced in p. falciparum, and the interplay between the parasite and its two hosts may compensate for the functions missing in the p. falciparum genome. the interactome of p. falciparum has been determined experimentally  <cit>  and modeled genome-wide  <cit> . this allows comparisons to be done between the genomes and interactomes of p. falciparum and its two hosts, h. sapiens and a. gambiae .

using the experimental ppis and interologs,  <dig>  inter-species interactions between p. falciparum and h. sapiens  were found . the gene ontology annotations of the p. falciparum and h. sapiens genes were identified. these inter-species ppis have been grouped based on the ontology of their biological processes. the resulting network is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the nodes in figure  <dig> are biological processes from p. falciparum and h. sapiens. links between p. falciparum and h. sapiens biological processes were derived from interactions linking two genes that participate in the respective biological processes in the two species. darker lines indicate the involvement of more interactions, allowing more interplay between the two biological processes. the p. falciparum biological processes are shaded using different levels of grey. darker nodes indicate that more genes are involved in the process. in figure  <dig>  the metabolic processes and cellular processes of p. falciparum are most abundant in the host-parasite interaction network. this is understandable, since p. falciparum is a parasite and needs to acquire nutrients from the host erythrocyte. in the genomic-wide model of the p. falciparum interactome, only a small fraction of intra-p. falciparum interactions contributed to metabolic processes  <cit> , which supports the notion that p. falciparum metabolic processeses may be dependant on human metabolic and cellular processes. there are also other interesting interactions between p. falciparum and the antimicrobial, antibacterial, cell killing and immune system processes of h. sapiens.

filtering and analysis of predicted inter-species interactions
although more than  <dig>  h. sapiens-p. falciparum ppis were inferred, not all of these interactions are likely to take place under physiological conditions due to spatiotemporal constraints. filtering using gene ontology annotations resulted in  <dig> host-pathogen interactions. further filtering of p. falciparum sequences using the presence/absence of translocational signals led to  <dig> ppis . only  <dig> p. falciparum proteins participate in these  <dig> ppis . one of the p. falciparum proteins, calmodulin , interacts with  <dig> human proteins. it is well known that p. falciparum requires an environment with high ca2+ levels  <cit> , and the abundence of calmodulin-based interactions may help p. falciparum maintain this high ca2+ concentration  <cit> . among the  <dig> human proteins interacting with pf14_ <dig>   <dig> also interact with human calmodulin . this suggests that p. falciparum calmoduin shares some of the targets of human calmodulin, and may hijack these ppis for its own purpose. the protein with the second highest number of interactions was n-myristoyltransferase . many proteins interacting with calmodulin require myristoylation in n-terminal  <cit> , further supports the functioning of the calmodulin-centric network.

previously, dyer et al.  <cit>  have inferred host-pathogen interactions using bayesian statistics. h. sapiens-p. falciparum ppis predicted by the bayesian approach are mainly enriched in 'blood coagulation' and 'membrane integration' protein interactions. this may partly be due to the gene ontology terms used to filter the ppis. it is difficult to compare the two works, since the datasets and methodology used are different. however, the intersection of the two datasets reveals  <dig> interactions between pf14_ <dig> and the tnf receptor associated factor family . pf14_ <dig> is a hypothetical protein. inspection of the homologene database reveals that pf14_ <dig> may be a homolog of dnaja <dig> . the functional implications of these three interactions require further investigation. however, tnf associated factor family are known to be involved in host immune response, suggesting that p. falciparum may interfere with this defence mechanism in h. sapiens. all in all, the diversity of different host-pathogen interaction inference methods suggests that these and other approaches may complement each other. and further development of the ability to predict host-pathogen interactions may benefit from the combination of multiple diverse approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
the expansion of all orthologous pairs enables the inference of interologs for various eukaryotic organisms, as illustrated by poinet . the same inference method can also be applied to the prediction of inter-species interaction, especially in the case of host-pathogen interactions. the h. sapiens-p. falciparum ppis inferred in our work reveal that p. falciparum may utilize calcium modulating proteins in the host cell to maintain ca2+ levels, and this may serve as a target for drug development strategies  <cit> .
