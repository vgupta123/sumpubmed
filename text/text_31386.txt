BACKGROUND
sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in the world, accounting for more than  <dig> million people worldwide  <cit> . in most cases, regardless of the original cause, hearing loss is related to the degeneration and death of hair cells and their associated spiral ganglion neurons  <cit>  where damage results from acoustic over-stimulation, infection, ototoxic drugs and ageing. over 5 % of the world’s population,  <dig> million people, has disabling hearing loss  and approximately one-third of people over 65 years of age are affected by disabling hearing loss  <cit> . importantly, there is strong indication that hearing impairment is becoming more common among children and young adults possibly due to new trends such as exposure to portable music players  <cit> . despite the need, few options are available to patients, there are cochlear implants, but no drugs for treating hearing loss  <cit> . although there is a massive social and economic demand to develop therapeutic treatments for hearing loss, deafness remains one of the most widespread, costly and poorly understood disabilities in the world.

significant gaps remain in our knowledge regarding the molecular interactions underpinning auditory function, including the factors required for cellular regeneration and regulation of cochlear gene expression. whereas non-mammalian vertebrates can replace sensory hair cells through transdifferentiation of epithelial supporting cells  <cit>  this spontaneous regenerative capacity has been lost in mammals. however, in mammals, supporting cells can be forced to transdifferentiate into new auditory hair cells given the right stimulus, namely over-expression of atoh <dig>  which is normally only expressed during fetal development  <cit> . this suggests that the molecular systems required for inducing inner ear hair cell fate are still present and functional in adult mammalian supporting cells, and their fate may be altered if the cells receive the appropriate signals  <cit> .

alternative factors for sensory hair cell regeneration were recently described, e.g. cell cycle genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b . during development, pro-sensory progenitors in the organ of corti proliferate until expression of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip <dig> induces cell-cycle arrest and terminal differentiation  <cit> . in p27kip <dig> deficient knock-out mice, cell division in the organ of corti continues past embryonic day  <dig> when mitosis is normally completed, leading to supernumerary production of supporting and hair cells in the organ of corti  <cit> . however, the organization of the hair cell area is incompatible with a normally active cochlea and as a result auditory function is severely impaired in p27kip <dig> deficient mice  <cit> . from a therapeutic perspective, although analysis of isolated postnatal supporting cells in vitro suggested that p27kip <dig> represents a suitable target for hair-cell regeneration  <cit> , induced p27kip <dig> depletion ex vivo and in vivo revealed no transdifferentiation of supporting cells into hair cells and thus identified obstacles that need to be overcome in order to achieve hair cell regeneration via stimulation of supporting cell proliferation in vivo  <cit> .

micrornas are conserved small non-coding rna molecules that have crucial roles in regulating gene expression and cell fate. micrornas regulate cell physiology by fine-tuning tissue and cell-type specific expression of multiple target rnas through several post-transcriptional mechanisms such as inhibition of translation  <cit>  and induction of mrna destabilization and decay  <cit> . by simultaneously controlling multiple target rnas some mirnas have been shown to modulate several components of a single pathway, whereas other mirnas have been found to modulate biological processes by targeting distinct rnas in key cellular pathways  <cit> .

recently, the importance of mirnas in inner ear development and their role in the maintenance of hearing has been demonstrated in multiple animal models, including zebrafish and rodents . moreover, the essential role of mirnas in auditory function became evident by the discovery of mutations in mir- <dig> underlying non-syndromic hearing loss in human  <cit> . these findings and additional studies have led to the idea that mirnas may have a therapeutic role for sensory hair cell regeneration, either as being the active agent for promoting regeneration or by helping to uncover downstream targets involved in regeneration  <cit> .

next-generation rna sequencing  has brought remarkable opportunities for the discovery of differential gene expression. while rna-seq has been widely used in multiple fields to identify and characterize mirnas, the technology has just started to be exploited for mirna profiling in the inner ear where rna-seq revealed a number of mirnas being differentially expressed between cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia  <cit> . to identify mirnas being differentially expressed during hair cell differentiation, we conducted genome-wide next generation non-coding rna sequencing of the inner ear cell line, ub/oc- <dig>  the cell line ub/oc- <dig> has been conditionally immortalized from a population of non-sensory epithelial cells in the greater epithelial ridge  and has the potential to differentiate into cells with a hair-cell-like phenotype, without the intervention of atoh <dig>  <cit> . ger cells were previously shown to resemble proliferative progenitors and based on their capability to differentiate into hair cells provide a useful tool for studies on gene expression profiling and mechanism of mammalian cochlear hair cell differentiation/regeneration  <cit> .

non-coding rna sequencing identified several mirnas being differentially expressed during ub/oc- <dig> cell differentiation. functional validation of the most prominent down-regulated mirnas revealed that depletion of mir- <dig> triggers differentiation of ub/oc- <dig> cells towards the hair-cell like phenotype indicating a possible role in maintaining the proliferative progenitor state. to explore whether the reciprocal approach can force non-sensory epithelial cells to switch to the hair cell phenotype, we overexpressed mir- <dig> in cochlear explants and identified ectopic hair cell formation. using lineage tracing we confirmed that newly formed hair cells arise from sox2-expressing supporting cells. to further explore the mechanism of mir- <dig> function, potential mir- <dig> target genes were predicted using different algorithms and a number were functionally validated using a mir- <dig> pull-down assay. our experiments identify mir- <dig> as a new factor that has the potential to drive non-sensory epithelial cells towards a sensory hair cell phenotype and identify putative downstream targets mediating its effects.

RESULTS
ninety-nine mirnas are differentially expressed during ub/oc- <dig> differentiation
to investigate the potential role of micrornas in sensory hair cell formation, we performed next generation small rna sequencing  of ub/oc- <dig> cells, comparing the non-sensory epithelial precursor cell stage with cells at an early stage of differentiation towards a sensory hair-cell-like phenotype. this is possible because ub/oc- <dig> was previously derived from c57bl/ <dig> immorto mouse embryos and can be induced to differentiate in a conditional manner. when ub/oc- <dig> cells are cultured at 33 °c, in the presence of gamma-interferon, proliferation is maintained; but following removal of gamma-interferon from culture medium and increase of temperature to 39 °c, proliferation ceases and the cells start to differentiate  <cit> .

for mirseq we collected five samples of ub/oc- <dig> cells at precursor stage grown at 33 °c and three samples of differentiating ub/oc- <dig> cells collected 1 day after temperature shift to 39 °c . on average  <dig>  million reads were sequenced per sample and  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of trimmed reads aligned to mouse mirnas annotated in mirbase version  <dig>  <cit> . all reads were used to detect, respectively, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> distinct mature mirnas expressed in the precursor and differentiating stages of ub/oc- <dig> cells. microrna counts showed very high correlation between sample replicates . sample depth-specific bias was reduced by dividing the raw counts by the total number of million aligned reads per sample, i.e. reads per million . principal component analysis of such normalized microrna expression counts showed consistency across all replicate samples from the same group . we further normalized the raw mirna counts to model the variance across samples and performed a differential expression analysis . this led to the identification of  <dig> mature mirnas that significantly change expression 1 day after initiating ub/oc- <dig> differentiation . of these, expression of  <dig> mirnas was enhanced and expression of  <dig> mirnas was repressed during the early stages of differentiation . reassuringly, we found mir-200b to be significantly upregulated and mir- <dig> significantly downregulated in ub/oc- <dig> cells after shift to 39 °c which is consistent with previous findings  <cit>  and confirms ub/oc- <dig> as a valuable model to study differentiation of inner ear sensory epithelial cells.fig.  <dig> micrornas differentially expressed during ub/oc- <dig> differentiation. heat map representing color-coded expression levels of differentially expressed micrornas  in ub/oc- <dig> at precursor stage  and 24 h after induction of differentiation . micrornas are ranked by fold change. colors range from bright pink  to dark red . expression of  <dig> mirnas was enhanced and expression of  <dig> mirnas was repressed during early stages of differentiation



blockade of mir- <dig> induces pou4f <dig> hair cell marker expression in ub/oc-1
to evaluate a direct effect of mirna expression on maintaining the ub/oc- <dig> hair cell precursor stage, we selected eight of the most differentially expressed mirnas with high expression at the precursor stage for further analysis . for this, ub/oc- <dig> cells were transfected with lna  mirna antagonists and expression of the early hair cell marker pou4f <dig>   <cit>  was analyzed by rt-pcr, 72 h after transfection. pou4f <dig> is expressed in postmitotic cells committed to hair cell phenotype but not in mitotic progenitors in the inner ear sensory epithelium and was the only hair cell marker expressed in ub/oc- <dig> cells early after shift to 39 °c compared to several marker expressed after 14 days at 39 °c  <cit> . of the eight mirnas investigated, inhibition of mir- <dig> resulted in strong induction of pou4f <dig> hair cell marker expression , suggesting a role of mir- <dig> in maintaining the hair cell precursor stage.table  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas with high expression at precursor stage  selected for further analysis

overexpression of mir- <dig> promotes hair cell formation in organ of corti explants
based on the hypothesis that mir- <dig> plays an active role in maintaining a progenitor cell type we speculated that overexpression of mir- <dig> in differentiated cells may reverse their phenotype. to explore this possibility, we cultured explants of organ of corti from postnatal day  <dig>  wild-type mice and used an adenoviral construct for overexpression of mir- <dig> . adenovirus was chosen since it was previously shown to facilitate transduction of supporting epithelial cells and transgene expression in inner ear explants from p <dig> mice  <cit> . to confirm the transduction efficiency of the viral construct, we transduced organ of corti explants with adenovirus <dig> expressing the egfp reporter gene . after 72 h, only a few hair cells were transduced. in contrast, most of the supporting cells expressing sox <dig> showed robust egfp fluorescence following egfp-ad <dig> transduction  which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . next, we transduced organ of corti explants with mir210-ad <dig> where ectopic expression of mir- <dig> resulted in formation of additional cells expressing the hair cell marker myosin7a . myosin7a positive cells were found mostly in the outer hair cell area   at a density of  <dig> cells per 100 μm <dig> compared to the control samples which had a density of  <dig> cells per 100 μm <dig>  which was statistically significant  .fig.  <dig> adenovirus mediated mir- <dig> expression in organ of corti explants. a organ of corti explant transduced with adenovirus expressing egfp , transduced cells are identified by green fluorescence. b organ of corti explant transduced with either egfp-ad <dig>  or adenovirus expressing mir- <dig> . scale bars: 50 μm. c cell count of myosin 7a-positive cells per  <dig> um <dig>  mir210-ad <dig> transduced organ of corti explants were compared to egfp-ad <dig> transduced explants, all from wildtype mice



new hair cells formed from supporting epithelial cells
we made use of lineage tracing  <cit>  of the sox <dig> supporting epithelial cell marker to demonstrate that the new hair cells formed in the organ of corti were derived from supporting epithelial cells  <cit> . for lineage tracing we crossed sox2-creert <dig> knock-in mice with a mouse line facilitating conditional egfp expression. intraperitoneal tamoxifen injection into the lactating mothers results in cre recombinase-mediated excision of the floxed-stop cassette in double-transgenic pubs heterozygous for egfp and creert <dig> and permanent expression of egfp in both sox2-expressing cells as well as subsequent progeny cells . histological examination of the organ of corti from p <dig> double transgenic offspring showed no myosin7a hair cells derived from sox <dig> expressing supporting epithelial cells . in contrast, transduction of mir210-ad <dig> in organ of corti explants from p <dig> double transgenic offspring revealed a number of myosin7a positive hair cells derived from sox <dig> positive supporting epithelial cells , indicating that new myosin7a expressing cells had differentiated from supporting cells as recently described  <cit> .fig.  <dig> lineage tracing of sox2-positive supporting cells after mir- <dig> overexpression in organ of corti explants. a lineage tracing: scheme showing individual mouse lines with modified sox <dig> and rosa <dig> gene loci for creert <dig> and conditional egfp expression, respectively. egfp expression is activated after crossing of both mouse lines and tamoxifen injection leading to sox2-cre-mediated excision of a floxed stop-cassette which facilitates constitutive egfp expression in sox <dig> expressing cells and cells derived thereof . b organ of corti explants of sox2creert2/r26egfp double transgenic offspring 4 days after tamoxifen administration. c organ of corti explants of sox2creert2/r26egfp double transgenic offspring 4 days after tamoxifen administration followed by mir210-ad <dig> transduction



putative targets of mir-210
we performed an extended computational search to identify potential targets of mir- <dig>  using the targetscan algorithm we generated a list of  <dig> conserved predicted transcript targets for the 3’ arms of the mouse and the human mir- <dig> sequences. this prediction was extended by adding  <dig> mouse and  <dig> human mirna-mrna interactions reported in metabase for mir-210-3p. human mrna interactions were used to annotate the mouse mirna predictions. these results were combined into a final list of  <dig> mir- <dig> putative targets . a gene ontology analysis using david  <cit>  indicated that these putative targets are involved in cellular processes such as neural development, cell differentiation and regulation of macromolecule metabolic processes . a similar target prediction analysis was conducted for the mir-210-5p arm but did not lead to any significant results. our  <dig> predicted mir- <dig> targets were compared to mir- <dig> targets previously reported by he et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  and annotated for their presence or absence in these datasets . while almost half of the predicted gene targets had been reported previously,  <dig> out of the  <dig> had not been reported before.table  <dig> putative mir- <dig> targets identified by integrative analysis

genes are displayed in five different classes based on the nature of the supporting evidence . literature-verified mirna/mrna interactions retrieved from metabase were annotated according to the ‘trust’ of the source into “present”, “probably present”, “not likely present”, or “absent” . computational inferred interactions identified by targetscan were classified in two different groups, based on whether targets were predicted for the two species analyzed  or only one . predicted targets were compared to previous reports and identical findings annotated as “true” or “false”



mirtrap of mir- <dig> associated targets
to physically capture mir- <dig> targets we performed a mirna pull-down experiment using the mirtrap system . for this we co-transfected ub/oc- <dig> cells with a vector expressing the mirna precursor hairpin, pre-mir- <dig>  together with a vector driving the expression of a dominant negative subunit of risc that enables mirna binding to target rnas but prevents further processing. following pull-down of the inactive risc complex, captured rna was isolated and fold-enrichment of mrnas was determined by using a qrt-pcr array for mouse mir- <dig> targets  that includes all genes found in our in silico prediction. to minimize potential artifacts, mir- <dig> containing risc complexes were compared to risc complexes pulled-down from cells transfected with a scrambled sequence. all ct values were normalized to gapdh and a 2-fold enrichment versus control was regarded as a positive result. of  <dig> potential mir- <dig> targets analyzed by qrt-pcr, transcripts for  <dig> genes showed a greater than 2-fold enrichment . comparing these  <dig> enriched transcripts identified by mirtrap with table  <dig> validated  <dig> out of  <dig> targets  predicted in our in silico analysis .fig.  <dig> pull-down of mir- <dig> target rnas. immunoprecipitation of risc after mir- <dig> overexpression using a mirtrap approach followed by qrt-pcr of isolated mrna species. y axes represent fold enrichment versus scrambled control

discussion
sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in the world and as the population continues to age and expand, the number of patients who suffer from serious hearing loss continues to increase. damage of sensory hair cells in human is permanent and so various strategies of gene, stem-cell, and molecular therapy are currently being pursued in order to regenerate hair cells and restore hearing  <cit> . micrornas have emerged as a new class of molecules with potential for gene therapy by taking advantage of their natural role to orchestrate developmental and molecular pathways. micrornas function as master regulators of almost every cellular process where individual mirnas can coordinately regulate expression of multiple genes to accomplish biological functions  <cit> . besides the mirnas themselves, the down-stream targets of individual mirnas may reveal novel factors and mechanisms modulating cell fate and regeneration.

this study analyzed the differential expression of mirnas during differentiation of an inner ear progenitor cell line using unbiased, comprehensive next generation sequencing . functional characterization of several of the mirnas identified by this ngs profiling revealed one candidate, mir- <dig>  whose knock-down actually triggered differentiation from a progenitor cell stage towards a more differentiated hair cell phenotype. mir- <dig> is described as the “master hypoxamir”, the induction of mir- <dig> is associated with a hypoxic response in both normal and transformed cells and is associated with a wide spectrum of mir- <dig> targets with roles in mitochondrial metabolism, angiogenesis, dna repair, and cell survival . moreover, mir- <dig> was found to be increased following erythroid differentiation  <cit>  and has the ability to induce proliferation of isolated mesenchymal stem cells  <cit>  or induce angiogenesis and neurogenesis in mouse brain  <cit> . however, mir- <dig> has not previously been identified as being involved in age-related hearing loss  <cit>  nor as being significantly expressed in cochlear sensory epithelia of newborn mice  <cit> . since inhibition of mir- <dig> in ub/oc- <dig> changed cell fate from proliferation to differentiation we reasoned that mir- <dig> plays an active role in maintaining the proliferative progenitor cell stage. to evaluate the hypothesis that mir- <dig> overexpression may lead to the proliferation of differentiated cells we transduced mouse cochlear with an adenovirus expressing mir- <dig> and used lineage tracing to show the formation of new hair cells from former sox2-positive supporting epithelial cells. new hair cell formation identified in our model could be due to two mechanisms, either de-differentiation or transdifferentiation. both mechanisms have been discussed for sensory hair cell regeneration where transdifferentiation of supporting epithelial cells seems to be the prominent mechanism occurring in mammals after the forced induction of atoh <dig>  or spontaneously after hair cell damage in non-mammalian vertebrates .

to better understand the mechanism of new hair cell formation induced by mir- <dig> expression we performed a target prediction analysis using targetscan and previously published mir- <dig> interactions retrieved from metabase, as well as comparison of mir- <dig> predicted targets previously identified in hypoxia models  <cit> . this integrative analysis revealed  <dig> novel candidate targets besides those previously predicted. functional validation of mirna targets can be accomplished by using different strategies for mirna pull-down  and has been facilitated by the development of commercial reagents such as “mirtrap”. to identify candidate genes facilitating mir- <dig> mediated hair cell formation we performed immunoprecipitation of risc complexes enriched for mir- <dig> targets followed by quantitative pcr analysis of  <dig> predicted mouse mir- <dig> targets including the  <dig> targets identified in silico. besides the identification of several transcripts that have not been linked to sensory epithelium differentiation, we identified a number of transcripts differentially regulated in response to mir- <dig> expression and known to play a role in this process. of those, brain-derived neurotrophic factor  is a critical trophic factor required for the development and maintenance of the innervation of hair cells by afferent spiral ganglion neuron fibers  <cit> . changed expression of bdnf was also found during transdifferentiation of other cell systems  <cit>  and bdnf might support transdifferentiation to sensory hair cells once the process is initiated.

another factor identified by mirtrap is hoxa <dig>  a member of the homeobox  transcription factor family regulating embryonic patterning and organogenesis. hoxa <dig> was found to be transiently expressed in the developing otic epithelium and is thought to play a role in early regional patterning, thereby contributing to cell lineage development in the inner ear  <cit> . microarray analysis of hoxa1-null embryo mice compared to wild type mice revealed downstream targets of hoxa <dig> necessary for early inner ear development, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor- <dig> , which was the only validated downstream target that was up-regulated in hoxa <dig> mutants  <cit> . fgfr <dig> is necessary for the development of the organ of corti and is known to regulate the differentiation of sensory hair cells and supporting cells. inhibition of fgfr in the basilar papilla of birds results in increased hair cell formation and this increase was not associated with increased proliferation, suggesting that inhibition of the fgf pathway leads to the direct conversion of supporting cells into hair cells  <cit> . since loss of fgfr <dig> leads to excess hair cell development in the mouse organ of corti  <cit> , inhibition of fgfr <dig> via the mir-210/hoxa <dig> pathway might contribute to the differentiation of supporting cells to hair cells we observe in our experiments.

one more candidate for mediating mir- <dig> triggered hair cell differentiation is kctd <dig>  kctd <dig> was previously shown to function as hedgehog antagonist playing a role as developmental regulator of neural cell differentiation and regulates proliferation and apoptosis of developing granule cell progenitors. kctd <dig> functional knock-down was shown to impair hedgehog antagonism resulting in sustained proliferation of granule progenitor cells, a mechanism responsible for medullo-blastoma development  <cit> . sonic hedgehog  is also essential for inner ear sensory epithelia development; in shh knockout mice the cochlear sensory organ and spiral ganglion cells are not formed  <cit>  and shh can promote mouse inner ear progenitor cell proliferation and hair cell differentiation in vitro  <cit> . hedgehog signaling was further found to regulate hair cell differentiation in the mammalian cochlea in vivo  <cit> . moreover, shh renewed proliferation of supporting cells and hair cells in damaged postnatal rat cochleae and some proliferating supporting cells are likely to transdifferentiate into hair cells  <cit> . these findings are in line with our hypothesis that mir- <dig> mediated kctd <dig> knock-down results in re-activated shh leading to new hair cell formation; presumably by transdifferentiation of supporting epithelial cells as observed by lu et al.  <cit> .

finally, deltex- <dig>  is described as a transcriptional regulator downstream of the notch receptor and via inhibition of the transcription factor mash <dig> is responsible for the differentiation inhibition of neural progenitor cells  <cit> . the role of the notch pathway in inner ear development  <cit>  as well as for hair cell regeneration  <cit>  has been previously described making dtx <dig> another candidate target for mir- <dig> mediated transdifferentiation of supporting epithelial cells to sensory hair cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of mir- <dig> driving supporting epithelial cells towards the sensory hair cell phenotype provides new avenues for the treatment of hearing loss. further validation of downstream targets mediating the effect will be facilitated by novel technologies like crispr and is anticipated to lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to cure deafness.
