BACKGROUND
the hypothalamus regulates feed intake and satiety in vertebrates. however, species differ greatly in their feeding habits. intensive genetic selection for growth rate of broiler  chickens has resulted in a remarkable increase in feed intake. since the hypothalamus regulates feed intake and satiety in vertebrates, the function of the chicken hypothalamus has been extensively studied in response to numerous hormones and neuropeptides  <cit> . importantly, hypothalamic function of chickens is well correlated with other species in many respects  <cit> . a few exceptions include the lack of response in the chicken to specific orexigenic peptides, such as orexin-a and b, galanin, motilin, and melanin concentrating hormone  <cit> . despite the information available, the specific mechanisms by which the hypothalamus coordinates all inputs to control feeding and metabolism in chickens, or any other avian species, is not understood, as it is difficult to evaluate all possible changes within the animal simultaneously. similarly, a comprehensive analysis of hypothalamic gene expression related to appetite and satiety has not been reported for any species.

microarrays have been recently used to evaluate genes within the liver of 4-week-old chickens that were fed or fasted  <cit> . in that study, many gene expression differences directly regulating metabolism and nutrient utilization were revealed, and it was determined that fasting, in general, caused more down-regulation of genes than up-regulation. specifically, they observed that  <dig>  genes were differentially regulated by fasting. in the present study, we utilized microarrays to examine global gene expression in the hypothalamus during feeding, fasting, or delayed feeding of newly hatched chicks. since the hypothalamus integrates hunger and satiety input from the digestive tract, liver, and fat stores, we examined the transcriptional response of the hypothalamus to nutrient deprivation. evaluation of global gene expression in the hypothalamus during fasting or after delayed feeding allowed us to evaluate genes known to be associated with feed intake and metabolism, as well the opportunity to discover genes not previously associated with the regulation of feed intake and metabolism. hypothalamic neurons isolated from fed and fasted chicks were then treated in culture to evaluate the functionality of one gene network predicted from the microarray results.

RESULTS
experiment  <dig> microarray and qrt-pcr analysis
these experiments were performed to analyze global gene expression in the hypothalamus of newly hatched chicks fasted, fed, or fed following a  <dig> h fast. a description of all treatment groups is detailed in table  <dig>  body weight and yolk sac weight were obtained at each sampling time . mean body weight at hatch was  <dig> g, and this did not significantly change within  <dig> hours in fed or fasted chicks. however, by  <dig> h, fed chicks were significantly heavier than chicks fasted or delayed fed for  <dig> h. at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, fed chicks were again heavier  than their delayed fed counterparts. remarkably, by  <dig> h, fed chicks had effectively doubled their hatching body weight. yolk sac weights were not significantly different between treatments within a time point, and steadily decreased with increasing age of the chicks.

differing letters within columns indicate significant  differences.

microarray analysis was performed using the operon/ark  <dig>  k long oligo arrays, which are printed with  <dig>  chicken oligo probes. data were deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus, accession number gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>  our analysis returned data for  <dig>  probes on at least  <dig> out of  <dig> slides within a group. of these,  <dig>  differed in expression levels by at least  <dig>  fold among treatment groups. among the  <dig>  genes that differed in expression levels,  <dig> were significantly different  as determined by anova. of these,  <dig> were shown to be upregulated in fasted chicks at  <dig> h as compared to fed chicks , and  <dig> genes were downregulated in fasted compared to fed chicks at  <dig> h . additionally, the  <dig> genes found to be differentially regulated were functionally characterized using go terms, and these terms are included in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  evaluation of the biological process go terms for these genes revealed that many different biological processes in the hypothalamus are affected by fasting of chicks, as there were no terms encompassing the majority of genes.

rna samples were analyzed by qrt-pcr to confirm differential expression of  <dig> genes found to be significantly affected by fasting with the microarray analysis . selected genes for qrt-pcr that were upregulated by fasting for  <dig> or  <dig> h included neuropeptide y receptor  <dig> , deiodinase ii , somatostatin receptor  <dig> , aromatase , fk <dig> binding protein  <dig> , and coagulation factor c  . selected downregulated genes were fatty acid binding protein  <dig> , pro-opiomelanocortin , and protein kinase c iota . additional genes found to be downregulated by fasting in the microarray were hemoglobin alpha , oxysterol 7-α-hydroxylase- <dig>  and sal-like  <dig> . the genes most highly upregulated by fasting in chicks were cyp19a and fkbp <dig>  which exhibited a 3-fold increase in expression due to fasting at  <dig> h . five of the six genes that were up-regulated in the  <dig> h fasted group returned to fed levels after  <dig> h of feeding, and cyp19a <dig> returned to fed levels by  <dig> h of feeding. of the down-regulated genes, hba exhibited a 5-fold decrease in expression in fasted chicks at  <dig> h, and fabp <dig> exhibited a 3-fold decrease in expression in fasted chicks . in general, genes down-regulated by fasting required delayed feeding of at least  <dig> h to return to fed levels, with the exception of hba, which did not return to the levels of fed chicks by  <dig> h of delayed feeding.

we also performed qrt-pcr on genes of interest in the hypothalamus that have been associated with feeding and fasting, metabolism, and growth. these genes were either not represented on the microarray or did not meet the criteria for candidate genes . these genes included neuropeptide y , agouti-related protein , leptin receptor , corticotropin releasing hormone , growth hormone releasing hormone , thyrotropin releasing hormone  and melanocortin  <dig> receptor  . as expected, npy and trh had significantly increased expression after  <dig> h of fasting, and mrna levels did not return to the level of fed chicks until  <dig> h of delayed feeding. mc4r was moderately and significantly upregulated in chicks fasted for  <dig> h. lepr exhibited increased expression in chicks fasted  <dig> h. agrp likewise showed a non-significant increase in expression after  <dig> h of fasting. ghrh and crh did not differ significantly in expression levels between treatments at a single time point.

experiment  <dig> pathway analysis
gene ids for human orthologs of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were submitted to pathway miner, an online tool which searches three publicly available databases and determines gene interaction networks or pathways represented in the list of genes submitted. analysis of our candidate genes revealed an interaction network of six genes : npy5r, metabotropic glutamate receptor  <dig> , sstr <dig>  pomc, relaxin  <dig>  and beta-2-adrenergic receptor . expression of all genes increased in response to fasting with the exception of pomc, which was reduced by fasting.

gene networks were then analyzed with ingenuity pathway analysis software. analysis of genes significantly regulated between fed and fasted chicks on d <dig> and d <dig> with a fold difference of ≥  <dig>  revealed two primary pathways . further analysis using a dataset of  <dig> genes differentially regulated between any two groups with a fold difference ≥  <dig>  revealed a putative pathway that included the genes pomc, adrb <dig>  and sstr <dig>  which were also constituents of the pathway miner output .

experiment 2
in order to confirm the effects of fasting on differential expression of selected genes, we performed another experiment in which chicks were again hatched and fed or fasted for  <dig> or  <dig> h. qrt-pcr was utilized to determine mrna levels of npy, dio <dig>  fkbp <dig>  trh, cyp19a <dig>  lepr, pomc, fabp <dig>  and adrb <dig> . in general, expression in fasted compared with fed birds was consistent with the results from experiment  <dig>  pomc and fabp <dig> were significantly reduced in fasted chicks at  <dig> h. lepr was expressed at significantly lower levels at  <dig> h compared with  <dig> h, regardless of feeding status. expression of npy, dio <dig>  fkbp <dig>  trh, and cyp19a <dig> did not significantly differ in expression levels between treatments, yet the trend of increased expression of these genes in the 48nf group was consistent with the expression data from experiment  <dig>  this reduced number of significant effects in experiment  <dig> may be attributed to the fewer number of samples utilized in the second experiment . mc4r, sstr <dig>  and npy5r were also evaluated  and did not change due to treatment. adrb <dig> was evaluated due to its presence in the proposed pathway. adrb <dig> mrna was significantly increased in chicks fasted for both  <dig> and  <dig> h, which was consistent with the microarray expression analysis .

experiment  <dig> culture and treatment of primary hypothalamic neurons
to determine whether the gene network predicted by both pathway miner and ingenuity pathway analysis was indeed functional, we isolated primary hypothalamic neurons from chicks following fasting or feeding for  <dig> or  <dig> h, and treated them with hormones or receptor agonists in vitro. our goal was to determine if the genes within the network could be regulated by treatments corresponding to receptors within this gene network. this experiment also evaluated the effects of nutritional status of the chicks  and timing  on the effects of treatments in vitro. following treatments in culture, gene expression was determined by qrt-pcr.

primary hypothalamic neurons were isolated from chicks fed or fasted for  <dig> or  <dig> h, and maintained in culture in neurobasal medium  for  <dig> h. treatments were then added to the medium for  <dig> h. treatments included alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone , which is the primary hormone derived from pomc in the hypothalamus; neuropeptide y , the hormone agonist for npy5r; somatostatin , the hormone agonist for sstr5; nor-epinephrine  an agonist for adrb2; and lsop which functions as a type iii metabotropic receptor agonist, of which grm <dig> is a member. total rna was isolated and gene expression determined using qrt-pcr for the following genes: pomc, mc4r, npy, npyr <dig>  adrb <dig>  grm <dig>  and sstr <dig>  gene expression in non-treated control wells was significantly different only between  <dig> h fed and fasted chicks for pomc, which correlated with data from the microarray where pomc was likewise decreased by fasting . three genes were significantly regulated by multiple treatments added to the medium. mc4r expression was reduced by all treatments in fed chicks at  <dig> h. adrb <dig> was significantly reduced by αmsh, npy, srif, and lsop in fasted chicks at  <dig> h, but increased by npy and lsop in fasted chicks at  <dig> h. expression of grm <dig> at  <dig> h was regulated by αmsh, npy, and lsop in such a way that it was downregulated in fed chicks and increased  in fasted chicks. gene expression was also measured for npy5r and sstr <dig> , with the only significant differences being reduced expression of sstr <dig> in  <dig> h fasted controls compared with  <dig> h fed controls, and reduced expression of sstr <dig> in the presence of lsop in  <dig> h fasted chicks. a summary of significant differences due to treatment is shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
the hypothalamus controls feeding and satiety in vertebrates, and directs growth and metabolism  <cit> . we performed microarray analysis to evaluate global gene expression in the hypothalamus in order to identify genes and gene networks differentially expressed in response to fasting and feeding of newly hatched chicks. our analysis compared gene expression in the hypothalamus of chicks that were fed or fasted for  <dig> or  <dig> h, as well as chicks that were fed following a  <dig> h fast. fasting of chicks can retard growth compared to chicks fed immediately for up to  <dig> weeks of age  <cit> , yet the mechanisms behind the long-term effects of fasting on growth and metabolism are not known. therefore, we included delayed feeding treatments  to provide insight into potential gene expression differences that may persist after animals are allowed access to feed.

among genes that were increased by fasting, were the neuropeptide receptors npy5r and sstr <dig>  as npy is known to be increased in fasted animals  <cit> , and intra-cerebroventricular  administration of this neuropeptide causes increased feed intake  <cit> , the upregulation of its receptor due to fasting is not surprising. sstr <dig> is a somatostatin receptor that is primarily found in the pituitary gland. however, sstr <dig> mrna in the central nervous system of rats was detected primarily in the hypothalamus and preoptic area  <cit> . receptor subtype-specific immuno-histochemistry of the rat hypothalamus revealed few sstr5-positive cells, and those that were observed were primarily found in the median eminence  <cit> . the role that sstr <dig> plays in the hypothalamus is not clear.

dio <dig> expression was significantly increased in fasted chicks at both  <dig> and  <dig> h, returning immediately to the levels of fed chicks in the 4df group. this was a particularly interesting finding, because dio <dig> converts thyroid hormones from inactive t <dig> to active t <dig>  and we anticipated an opposite effect of fasting. however, elevated levels of dio <dig> activity would be expected to cause increased t <dig> within the hypothalamus, resulting in reduced trh release through negative feedback  <cit> . in response, the pituitary gland would be expected to decrease release of tsh. subsequently, levels of circulating t <dig> would then be reduced, and the metabolic rate of the chick would be reduced, ultimately in response to the elevated hypothalamic dio <dig>  thus, it could be predicted that increased hypothalamic dio <dig> activity would ultimately decrease metabolism through feedback mechanisms. the increased dio <dig> mrna levels observed in response to fasting are consistent with this model. other genes significantly increased by fasting for  <dig> h include cyp19a <dig> , fkbp <dig>  and coch. their respective functions include conversion of androgens to estrogen, facilitating translocation of proteins such as nuclear hormone receptors to the nucleus, and providing structure to the ear. the significance of increased expression of these genes within the hypothalamus in fasted chicks is unknown.

among genes with reduced expression due to fasting were the genes fabp <dig>  which is a brain-specific fatty acid binding protein, pomc , and prkci. importantly, hypothalamic αmsh is known to increase metabolic rate. therefore, it was not surprising to see pomc mrna decreased by fasting, presumably as part of the overall mechanism down-regulating metabolism to compensate for decreased feed intake. all genes reduced by fasting returned to similar expression levels as full-fed chicks within  <dig> h of delayed feeding.

cyp39a <dig> and sall <dig> genes were also down-regulated by fasting at  <dig> and  <dig> h. cyp39a <dig> functions primarily to convert cholesterol to bile acids, and sall <dig> is a transcription factor. information on the function of these genes specifically in chickens was not available. further, the qrt-pcr expression results for both genes were not completely correlated with the microarray results. we also observed a significant reduction in expression of hba in the hypothalamus of fasted chicks, which did not return to the levels of fed chicks even after  <dig> h of delayed feeding. the specific function and potential importance of the reduction of hba in the hypothalamus of chicks due to fasting is not known.

seven genes that are known to be associated with feed intake, metabolism or growth, for which microarray data were unavailable or the microarray analysis did not indicate significant differences, were also evaluated by qrt-pcr. these included genes for two orexigenic neuropeptides, npy and agrp. these two genes are co-expressed in neurons within the arc that participate in the melanocortin pathway  <cit> , and both were increased in the 48nf group. increased npy mrna would be consistent with increased appetite in fasted birds, and increased agrp, an antagonist to α msh for mc4r, would be consistent with reduced metabolic rate in fasted chicks. we likewise observed a significant increase in expression of both mc4r and trh mrna in chicks fasted for  <dig> h, and a significant increase in lepr expression was observed in 24nf chicks compared with 24ff chicks. increased levels of hypothalamic mc4r and lepr expression might be due to depressed levels of α msh and leptin release in fasted animals. interestingly, trh mrna levels were increased at  <dig> hr but not at  <dig> hr, which is consistent with reduced negative feedback from reduced circulating t <dig> levels associated with a reduction of metabolic rate in fasted birds.

both npy and agrp can increase feeding in animals and inhibit the thyroid axis when administered icv, however they signal through different receptors  <cit> . npy signals through npy receptors, of which receptors y <dig> and y <dig> are associated with the induction of hyperphagia  <cit> . however, agrp is an inverse agonist of mc4r, and therefore directly plays a part in the melanocortin pathway  <cit> . in fasted broiler  chickens, agrp returned feed intake to control levels when co-administered with αmsh, which inhibited feed intake alone. interestingly, administration of agrp alone to non-fasted broiler chickens or leghorn  chickens only increased feed intake in the leghorn chickens  <cit> .

leptin is a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes in mammals, and high levels of leptin are generally indicative of satiety in mammals  <cit> . in this experiment, we observed an increase in leptin receptor  mrna levels in the hypothalamus following  <dig> h of fasting. although we did not determine the levels of circulating leptin in this experiment, administration of synthetic leptin has been reported to reduce feeding in chickens  <cit> , and these data could indicate that depressed leptin during fasting regulates expression of lepr. importantly, leptin is also a key regulator of the melanocortin system in the hypothalamus in mammals. leptin has been shown to directly inhibit npy and agrp neurons and to stimulate pomc and cart neurons in the arc of the hypothalamus in mice  <cit> . although substantial controversy exists regarding the sequence of chicken leptin cdna and peptide  <cit> , the leptin receptor in chickens has been sequenced unequivocally  <cit> , and chickens respond to recombinant chicken leptin as well as leptin derived from other species.

further analysis using pathway miner software indicated that our candidate gene list was enriched in genes participating in a network of associated genes due to their ability to regulate camp production in cells. genes from our list included in that network were: npy5r, grm <dig>  sstr <dig>  pomc, rln <dig>  and adrb <dig> . these genes represent hormones  and g-protein coupled receptors. the four receptors include two neuropeptide receptors  and two amino-acid derived neurotransmitter  receptors. among these genes, only pomc was downregulated by fasting in chicks, the other five genes were increased by fasting. as pomc encodes for the precursor of α msh, an important regulator of metabolic rate, this finding raised the intriguing possibility that control of metabolism by the hypothalamus involves interactions between npy, adrenergic, glutaminergic, and melanotropic neurons. interestingly, pomc, adrb <dig>  and sstr <dig> were also in a network predicted using ingenuity pathway analysis. however, this network for gene interactions within the hypothalamus was only hypothetical, so further experiments were designed to test their putative interactions.

in order to test the functionality of this gene network, we performed another experiment in vitro with isolated primary hypothalamic neurons. we treated primary hypothalamic neurons with hormones or receptor agonists in vitro corresponding to the genes within the putative network. our cell culture results confirmed that the gene network predicted from the microarray analysis is functional within the hypothalamus. genes within the network can directly affect expression of other genes in the network. for example, pomc expression was decreased by treatment with ne, an agonist for adrb <dig>  importantly, the activity and connectivity of this network was altered by the fed or fasted state of the chicks. this finding demonstrates that the metabolic perturbation of fasting was a useful tool in identifying genes that can control important regulators of metabolism, such as npy, pomc, mc4r, npyr <dig>  adrb <dig>  and grm <dig> . beyond this, the specific mechanism by which they regulate gene expression during feeding and fasting of chicks was not determined. it should be noted that we were unable to obtain chicken relaxin  <dig> for evaluation in this experiment, though it was included as part of the network by pathway miner. interestingly, the literature suggests that rln <dig> is involved with regulation of feeding and satiety, as it does increase feeding in rats following icv or ipvn injection  <cit> .

sstr <dig> expression was changed little by treatments of cultured neurons, with reduced expression occurring only in the presence of lsop in neurons from  <dig> h fasted chicks. in contrast, both adrb <dig> and grm <dig> expression were decreased by addition of srif to the culture medium. as sstr <dig> was differentially regulated between fasted and fed groups in vivo, the relative lack of regulation of this receptor may indicate it is not regulated by other gene products in this network of genes. alternatively, it may be regulated by other neurotransmitters, hormones, or metabolites affected by feeding or fasting. it should be noted, however, that srif treatment altered mrna levels for adrb <dig>  grm <dig>  and mc4r, demonstrating a potential role for hypothalamic srif and sstr <dig> in regulating metabolism.

npy, the ligand for npyr <dig>  is a neuropeptide associated with increased hunger, and icv injection of npy markedly increases feeding behavior in chickens  <cit>  and other species  <cit> . npy is produced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and co-expressed in neurons producing agrp, another orexigenic peptide. notably, although npyr <dig> was identified as part of this putative pathway, no agonists in the cell culture were capable of modifying npyr <dig> expression. however, npy treatment suppressed levels of mc4r and grm <dig> mrna, consistent with a role for npy in decreasing metabolic rate. treatment with αmsh increased npy expression in neurons from the hypothalamus of chicks fed for  <dig> h, suggesting the possibility of a negative feedback loop within the hypothalamus controlling metabolism. interestingly, icv administration of npy and αmsh reduced feed intake in chicks at the same level as administration of αmsh alone  <cit> , suggesting that melanocortin has a greater effect on feed intake than npy in chickens.

pomc is a principle component of the melanocortin system, which is centered in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus   <cit> . pomc is a precursor polypeptide which is cleaved into ten individual hormones, including αmsh. the melanocortin system largely regulates feed intake in animals through melanocortin receptors  <dig> and  <dig>  and mc4r has been shown in rats to increase in levels during fasting  <cit> . mutations in αmsh or mc4r result in obesity in mice  <cit> . in chickens, administration of αmsh markedly decreases feed intake  <cit> . in contrast to mammals, which only express mc4r in the brain, chicken mc4r is expressed in the adrenals, gonads, spleen, adipose, and brain  <cit> . though hypothalamic mc4r mrna levels were not significantly changed by fasting or feeding in the present experiment, they were reduced significantly in neurons from chicks fed for  <dig> h and treated with αmsh, npy, ne, or lsop. due to the fact that elevated αmsh levels are associated with satiety  and elevated npy levels are associated with fasting , the similar effects of both hormones on mc4r expression deserves further consideration. nonetheless, our findings support an integral role for mc4r in controlling metabolism and suggest that regulation of its expression is complex.

we hypothesize that the two receptors within the gene network that function as monoamine neurotransmitter receptors, adrb <dig> and grm <dig>  may function to integrate signals emanating from the melanocortin pathway in the hypothalamus. srif, αmsh, and npy reduced expression of both adrb <dig> and grm <dig> in this study. this occurred in fasted groups only for adrb <dig> and for fed and fasted groups for grm <dig>  importantly, agonists for both receptors have been associated with feed intake in other studies. in chickens, administration of ne into the ventromedial nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, or medial septal areas of the hypothalamus increased feed intake  <cit> . we observed decreased pomc expression at  <dig> h and mc4r expression at  <dig> h in fed chicks in response to administration of ne in vitro. decreases in pomc and mc4r are associated with increased appetite  <cit> . interestingly, injection of glutamate into the lateral hypothalamus of rats results in increased feed intake  <cit> . we also observed effects of the grm <dig> receptor agonist lsop on adrb <dig> expression in neurons from fasted chicks, but adrb <dig> expression was decreased at  <dig> h and increased at  <dig> h. our results support a role for hypothalamic adrenergic and glutaminergic neurons and adrb <dig> and grm <dig> in regulating feed intake and metabolism.

the effect of treatments in vitro was dependent on the nutritional state  of the donor animals. pomc was decreased by ne only in neurons from fed chicks. perhaps this was due to the fact that pomc expression is higher in neurons from fed than fasted chicks. likewise, npy decreased grm <dig> expression only in neurons from fed chicks, which may be attributed to the fact that npy is naturally increased in fasted chicks. further, mc4r was only regulated in neurons from fed chicks, and its expression was consistently decreased by all treatments at  <dig> h. additionally, the increase in npy expression in response to αmsh was only observed in neurons from fasted chicks, when α msh expression would be low and npy expression would be high. it should be noted that an observed lack of effect of an agonist does not preclude the possibility that the system is already maximally stimulated. in general, differences in gene expression in response to treatment were more dramatic following  <dig> h of feeding and fasting than at  <dig> h. this is expected, due to the fact that the effects of fasting or feeding should be more pronounced after a longer period of time.

treatment with the hormones and agonists for receptors in the putative gene network resulted in altered expression of other genes in the network. the fact that gene expression responses differed based upon the nutritional status of the chicks provides evidence that this pathway may indeed participate in the regulation of metabolic responses to feeding and fasting. as expected, the melanocortin pathway, involving pomc and mc4r, appears to play a critical role in feeding and satiety, along with npy, and potentially agrp. as αmsh has been shown in mice to regulate trh and crh  <cit> , and npy and agrp also function to reduce thyroid function  <cit> , the interaction of these genes likely influences many aspects of metabolism. the fact that all hormone treatments influenced mrna levels for the neurotransmitter receptors adrb <dig> and grm <dig> suggests the possibility that neural coordination of metabolism occurs through these receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
these experiments utilized microarray analysis to evaluate gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus of newly hatched chicks. we found that expression of numerous genes was affected by fasting, and most were returned to the same level as fully fed chicks within  <dig> h of delayed feeding. a gene network consisting of  <dig> differentially regulated genes was associated from our list of  <dig> candidate genes. we confirmed interactions among these genes through culture of primary hypothalamic neurons. our data indicate that the npy  and melanocortin pathways  may play an integral part in the regulation of feed intake and metabolism by the hypothalamus and that the receptors adrb <dig> and grm <dig> may be involved in the regulation or effector mechanisms of these pathways. further research is needed to completely elucidate potential interactions among these genes.
