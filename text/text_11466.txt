BACKGROUND
freezing lesions to the developing cortical plate result in a cascade of local and distal anatomical and physiological changes, including hyperexcitability around the point of disruption, deviation of axonal projections from targets in the hemisphere contralateral to the pathology, and changes in thalamo-cortical connectivity  <cit> . freezing lesions induced on postnatal day  <dig>  and p <dig> in rats resemble human four-layer microgyria . moreover, the presence of microgyria has been associated with rapid auditory processing impairments in rats  <cit> . given evidence that disruptions in auditory processing may contribute to disruptions in language development  <cit> , human microgyria could relate to human dyslexia, at least in part, through similar auditory processing disruptions  <cit> .

previous research indicates that injury to developing cortex during peak periods of neuronal migration results in greater decreases in brain weight and cortical volume as compared to injury occurring beyond the cessation of neuronal migration in rats . in fact, focal freezing lesions on p <dig> do not lead to significant decreases in brain weight, or cortical volume, nor the formation of four-layer microgyria as seen in p <dig> and  <dig> lesion cases. surprisingly, focal injury on p <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> does lead to deficits in processing brief gaps in white noise as measured during the juvenile period , regardless of the presence/absence of microgyria or changes in cortical volume/brain weight observed. however, when rapid auditory processing was assessed in adult rats , only subjects with lesions induced on p <dig>  were found to exhibit persistent rapid auditory processing deficits  <cit> . these data suggested that despite early behavioral impairments seen with focal lesions on p1- <dig>  cortical disruption specifically during neuronal migration appears to exert more pronounced and long-term behavioral and neuroanatomical effects as compared to injury occurring after the completion of neuronal migration.

in terms of human research, neuromorphometric studies investigating the effects of developmental pathology on long-term behavioral outcome are scarce. however, recent studies suggest a link between early cortical developmental malformations and learning-related cognitive impairments  on corpus callosum volume in rats previously assessed for auditory processing, brain weight and cortical volume  <cit> . we predicted that changes in corpus callosum volume would correspond with the profile of change previously seen for brain weight and cortical volume  <cit> , and that these changes would in turn reflect long-term behavioral outcome.

RESULTS
post mortem histological analysis  revealed no evidence of cortical damage in any of the sham subjects . post mortem analysis showed the presence of double bilateral microgyria only in the p <dig>  and p <dig>  lesion groups. the p <dig>  lesion group, which received comparable freezing lesion treatments relative to the p <dig> and p <dig> groups, did not show evidence of microgyria. however, the p <dig> lesion group did show some disrupted cortical lamination in areas of cortex directly underlying the probe application points. lesions were seen mostly in sensorimotor cortex , with some extension into frontal, temporal, or occipital cortices. the majority of double lesions in p <dig> and p <dig> conditions appeared as one continuous severe microgyric lesion. however, the p <dig> group showed a pattern of disruption that was centered on the specific areas of probe application. this pattern appeared as four relatively small distinct pockets of displaced cortical lamination resulting from the freezing insults .

corpus callosum volume
a univariate anova was computed for corpus callosum volume, using age at treatment  and treatment  as fixed factors . results showed a significant main effect of treatment on corpus callosum volume , with lesion subjects showing significantly smaller callosal volumes as compared to shams. an age at treatment × treatment interaction was also found for corpus callosum volume , indicating that corpus callosum volumes were smaller as the age of injury decreased from p <dig> to p <dig>  among lesion subjects, simple effects analyses revealed significant differences between p <dig> and p <dig> , and p <dig> and p <dig> , subjects. there was no significant difference between p <dig> and p <dig> lesion subjects . however, unlike the p <dig> lesion group , p <dig> subjects did show a significant reduction in corpus callosum volume compared to shams  , indicating an overall reduction in corpus callosum volume similar to, but not as great as, the reduction seen in the p <dig> lesion condition  .

discussion
the current findings show that focal bilateral freezing lesions to the developing cortex result in differential reductions in corpus callosum volume as a function of the timing of the insult. results show an age of treatment by treatment interaction, indicating that as the age at injury moves from p <dig> to p <dig> the corpus callosum becomes smaller. this progressive decrease in corpus callosum volume is evidenced by smaller callosal volumes in p <dig> versus p <dig> lesion, and p <dig> lesion versus sham subjects. although the cause of these changes is unknown, the current results add to previous studies showing reduced cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity, along with reductions in cortical volume and brain weight, resulting from p <dig> lesion-induced microgyria  <cit> . as previously reported for the subjects in the current analysis, brain weight and cortical volume decrease as a function of the age at which injury occurs. specifically, p <dig> induced lesion subjects had the smallest cortex and brain weight compared to shams, followed by p <dig>  and then the p <dig> lesion group . all of these data taken together suggest that changes in corpus callosum volume, in addition to cortical volume and brain weight, may represent an important clinical marker for the timing of cortical developmental pathology, which may contribute to some aspects of learning impairment. moreover, the current report provides increased support for the hypothesis that early injury to developing cortex can have marked effects on the volume of various structures directly and indirectly related to the point of disruption.

we previously reported that p <dig> focal injury to cortex led to long-term impairment in processing short but not long duration gaps in white noise using a startle response paradigm  <cit> . further, prior to the current analysis all subjects received a total of  <dig> days of silent gap/reflex modification testing  <cit> . during the juvenile period , all subjects in the current brain assessment received  <dig> days of silent gap testing, in addition to  <dig> days of silent gap testing in adulthood . briefly, acoustic testing involved the placement of rats on a load cell platform while a pseudo randomized set of variable duration silent gaps was presented in continuous  <dig> db broadband white noise prior to a  <dig> db startle eliciting noise burst. detection of the silent gap cue elicited a reduction in the startle response relative to an uncued trial, where no gap preceded the startle burst. importantly, subjects with the largest reduction in corpus callosum volume , as seen in the current analysis, showed the worst long-term behavioral outcome  <cit> . specifically, p <dig> lesion subjects continued to show impairments in 2– <dig> ms silent gap detection after p <dig>  whereas p <dig> and p <dig> lesion groups no longer showed the robust pattern of impairment . it is important to note that all of the subjects evaluated in the current study received the same testing experience prior to sacrifice. further, the nature of reflex modification insured that alternative strategies could not be used as with more complex maze learning or operant conditioning tasks. while the possibility exists that behavioral testing effected the brains of the three lesion groups or shams differently, the fact that p <dig> and sham subjects did not differ in corpus callosum volume suggests that age at injury was an important factor in determining long-term neuromorphological profiles across groups. further, even with repeated behavioral testing these results are especially important within the clinical context. however, future studies will seek to determine the effects of different types of experience on key anatomical markers, such as corpus callosum volume.

although the results of the current study do not address the causal mechanisms underlying auditory processing impairments, they may represent an additional marker for the presence of developmental pathology which might be involved in the appearance of human learning impairments such as dyslexia,  <cit> , as well as cortical developmental malformations  <cit> . in recent years, as neuroimaging has become more accessible to researchers, the corpus callosum has gained increased attention as a target for possible pathology underlying developmental learning impairments  <cit> . however, sampling in these studies is frequently limited to young adults and there is often little information regarding the timing or occurrence of pre/pari natal insults. therefore, the use of rodent models of focal cortical injury such as the one presented here may help identify possible windows during brain development at which particular structures are more susceptible to degradation, which in turn could lead to more pronounced long term behavioral pathology. the present data supports the notion that assessment of colossal morphology in populations at risk for neurodevelopmental pathologies , may help identify whether and when injury occurred, as well as predict potential long-term behavioral outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the reductions in corpus callosum volume in the p <dig> and  <dig> lesion groups are consistent with the reductions in brain weight and cortical volume previously reported for microgyric rats  <cit> . current results suggest that disruption to the cortical plate during early postnatal development may lead to more widely dispersed neurovolumetric anomalies and subsequent behavioral impairments  <cit> , compared with injury that occurs later in development. further, these results suggest that in a human clinical setting decreased corpus callosum volume may represent an additional marker for long-term behavioral outcome.
