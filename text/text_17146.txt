BACKGROUND
the laboratory rat has proven to be an important model organism for human disease, physiology, immunology and pharmacology  <cit> . over the years, selective breeding for disorders has resulted in the establishment of more than  <dig> inbred lines that allows the study of factors involved in human multi-factorial diseases under controlled experimental conditions  <cit> . genetic mapping and identification of components that affect disease-related phenotypes in the rat can be extremely useful to improve insight in the analogous human syndromes  <cit> .

traditionally, qtl mapping studies in rat  have been limited by the availability of markers and often focused marker development was needed to successfully link genomic regions to a specific trait . genome information has increased dramatically with technological advances  <cit>  and consequently the number of candidate markers has increased significantly. however, due to the phylogenetic relationship of rat inbred strains, large haplotype blocks can be found grouping several snps together. the eu framework  <dig> programme 'star, a snp and haplotype map for the rat', set out to identify these regions  <cit> . combined with new genotyping methods, cheap and versatile genome-wide genotyping has come within reach  <cit> . here, we describe the design and application of a panel or  <dig> rat snps for the versatile and fast kaspar system , which uses a competitive allele-specific pcr combined with a fret quenching reporter oligo. for each snp, three unlabeled oligos need to be synthesized, but the assay runs as a standard pcr. after amplification using genomic dna as a template, the fluorophore signals are determined and genotypes are automatically determined. the snp panel and genotyping information for more than  <dig> commonly used rat inbred strains reported here forms a versatile basis for the design of first round genetic mapping and association studies in a wide range of rat strains.

RESULTS
selection of snp candidates for assay setup
candidate snps were selected from various sources  with a preference for polymorphy between bn and ss or wistar and an equal physical distribution in the genome. this set was validated in duplo on bn , wistar  and bn-wistar mixed dna  to verify that both alleles could be amplified and heterozygotes are easily discerned from either homozygous genotype. from the originally designed  <dig> assays,  <dig> worked reliably  – i.e. showing clear clustering of genotypes- and subsets from these were used for further analyses. the conversion rate of 95% from candidate polymorphism to robust assay is relatively high for a snp genotyping platform. it should be noted that we did not perform any assay optimization in terms of oligo design or experimental conditions  and each assay was run with universal parameters.

genotyping
all  <dig> assays were typed in duplo on a panel of bn , wistar ,  <dig> other widely used inbred rat strains that are commercially available,  <dig> animals from a wild-derived rat strain and  <dig> wild rats  <cit> . after removing failed assays,  <dig>  duplo genotyping assays remained. from these assays,  <dig> genotype scores were discrepant between the duplos . another  <dig> snps indicated some heterozygosity while only homozygotes were expected in inbred strains. additionally, in  <dig> cases we could not reliable score one of the duplos . in the final dataset, these scores were removed and the final genotype was dictated by the single assay that produced a clear genotype. overall,  <dig> snps produced perfect duplo genotypes for all the strains without any uncertainty.

as expected, the genotyping clearly distinguished bn from ss or wistar  since snp design was biased to be polymorphic between these two strains. while the outbred wistar strain contains much more variable positions, lack of detectable polymorphisms in a few animals can obscure a potential informative marker. therefore we selected two genome-wide sets of markers. the first panel consists of a set of  <dig> markers that are polymorphic between bn and the tested wistar animals. the other markers are not informative in our bn/wistar crosses, but were chosen to cover big chromosomal gaps where no informative markers were available for bn/wistar. all the other rat strains show an intermediate pattern with a median number of  <dig> polymorphic markers for any pairwise strain combination, indicating that this panel is also informative for mapping studies using a wide range of rat strains. figure  <dig> shows a pairwise comparison of allele differences between strains. in this case, heterozygote markers are included since they can be informative. in our follow-up study, only the markers with homozygous alleles were used. all genotyping data, including information on the genomic locus and oligonucleotide sequences, can be explored for any arbitrary pairwise strain combination  <cit> .

the hierarchical clustering tree  shows the relationships between the strains and concurs with known genetic background  <cit>  and previous studies  <cit> . the domesticated wild-derived rats from groningen  are much more related to each other than the wild rats caught in utrecht, amsterdam and beers, which is most likely due to genetic drift in the colony which is now maintained in the lab for over  <dig> years.

phylogenetic analysis
the genotypes of a genome wide snp panel provide a good data set to infer a phylogenetic structure for this panel of inbred strains. at present, this structure is only available based on a small amount of snps  <cit>  or microsatellites  <cit> . the general topology of the hierarchical clustering of figure  <dig> is supported by a separate phylogenetic analysis resulting in a neighbor-joining tree . from this tree it is clear that the older nodes are only weakly supported, which is not surprising since a combination of different strains has been used to generate the current inbred strains. therefore, it is unknown how much each parental strain has contributed to the current strains and a high level of reticulation can be expected. a neighbornet analysis  indeed confirms this complex ancestral history and provides a more unbiased view of phylogenetic clusters. from both figures the large branch length towards bn is obvious. this probably reflects the ascertainment bias because snps are selected from a comparison with the published genome sequence of the brown norway rat  <cit> . however, similar studies using microsatellite markers, which are less sensitive to this bias, also showed that bn is relatively far diverged from the other rat inbred lines  <cit> . in general, a number of clusters can be distinguished in the unrooted neighbor-net: 1: ss-like, 2: ludw-like, 3: wistar-like, 4: bd-like, 5: wky/shr, 6: da-like and the group containing bn and the wild rats. most groups are formed by strains that are known to be closely related. for instance in the bd cluster, bde is an inbred strain crossed from the bd group and e <dig>  additionally, wky and shr are closely related  <cit>  and indeed cluster tightly together. the strains clustering in the wistar group have known wistar background  <cit> .

mapping of the obese trait in zucker rats
as a proof of principle for a mapping study, we used our validated snp panel in a cross with the zucker rat strain , a strain which is commonly used as a model in obesity research  <cit> . for this study, animals from the zucker strain were outcrossed with brown norway and f <dig> animals were backcrossed with zucker rats. the resulting bc animals were selected for genotyping based on their obese appearance at 3– <dig> weeks of age. as our snp panel was developed to contain polymorphic markers between bn and wistar or ss , a large number of informative markers was expected. indeed,  <dig> out of  <dig> markers tested were found to be polymorphic and these were genotyped on the  <dig> animals from the zucker – bn backcross. after genotyping, the bn/wistar mix controls showed a complete heterozygous profile indicating that all alleles were correctly amplified and detected. genotype calling was successful for 99% of the assays . we calculated the lod scores for the backcross  and found a single high score locus on chromosome  <dig> in the region 119– <dig> mb. this is in agreement with the fact that the obesity phenotype in zucker rats is caused by a mutation in the leptin receptor gene  on chromosome 5:  <dig> mb  <cit> . we show that a panel of  <dig> markers provides sufficient resolution to map a monogenetic trait to a region of less than  <dig> mb. as there are more markers available in the complete panel of  <dig> validated markers, it is still possible to perform further fine-mapping in regions of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
we established a versatile genome-wide snp genotyping panel for the rat that is flexible, fast, and relatively cheap . we show that this panel can be used for first round association analysis in genetic linkage and association studies and that it can be applied in a wide range of strain combinations. we show that a known monogenetic trait, like the leptin receptor locus in the zucker strain, can be easily mapped. furthermore, in an ongoing enu screen to generate knockouts in the rat, we mapped a clear phenotype to a region on chromosome  <dig> with a lod of  <dig>  in a population of  <dig> affected and  <dig> unaffected sibs . although this region contains a large number of genes, targeted finemapping with a set of additional kaspar markers and by sequencing, decreased the size of the linked region and revealed  <dig> candidate genes. as the rat is increasingly used in genetic studies, tools as described here are expected to further aid in understanding the contribution of genetic variation to phenotypic traits and disease.
