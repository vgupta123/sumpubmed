BACKGROUND
some viruses that infect vertebrates are able to acquire genes from their hosts <cit> . host organisms, in turn, have developed intricate mechanisms such as the innate and adaptive immune responses to defend themselves against viruses and other pathogens. acquired genes that increase the chances of survival within the hosts, can thus give us a unique view of the host’s immune system. to understand the defense systems of vertebrates against viruses, comprehensive knowledge of relationships between viral and mouse proteins is necessary. here, we select mouse  as a model vertebrate organism, since genetic techniques are well established for mice, and they have many genes orthologous to genes in humans. we considered the overlap between entries in the conserved domain database, and homologous domains in mouse and in a wide range of viral proteins. the result of this comprehensive comparison was compiled as the musvirus database .

in order to characterize the functions of acquired domains on a biological level, we mapped each mouse entry to dna microarray probe identifiers, allowing sets of differentially expressed genes to be uploaded to musvirus. here, we examined the number of viral homologs to genes differentially expressed in dendritic cells following stimulation of innate immune response pathways. for comparison we examine genes whose expression levels remained unchanged upon such stimulation, as well as genes differentially expressed upon stimulation of t cell receptors in t cells. together, these results indicated that genes involved in innate immune response pathways were more likely to be acquired by viruses than genes involved in adaptive immune response pathways or genes whose expression levels do not change significantly upon stimulation.

RESULTS
as described in the methods section, the web interface to musvirus enables text-based keyword searches, browsing by viral taxonomy, and batch upload of microarray identifiers . below, we review the results of such searches focusing in functional characterization of mouse-virus homologs.

overview of homologs between mouse and viral proteins
as a result of psi-blast searches of mouse proteins against viral proteins,  <dig>  out of  <dig>   of mouse proteins were found to have at least one viral homolog. among these,  <dig>  proteins had more than  <dig> viral homologs. mouse proteins with many viral homologs were often annotated as kinases and/or ankyrin repeats. dapk <dig> , a positive mediator of interferon-induced apoptosis, had the largest number  of viral homologs. psi-blast searches of viral proteins against mouse proteins detected  <dig>  out of  <dig>   proteins from  <dig>  viral species having at least one mouse homolog . protein-tyrosine kinase of y <dig> sarcoma virus, which causes cellular transformation leading to tumor formation  <cit> , had the largest number  of mouse homologs. although the fraction of viral proteins having mouse homologs is smaller than that of mouse proteins having viral homologs, the distributions of the number of homologs  suggest that viral proteins tend to be similar to a large number of mouse proteins if they do have mouse homologs. these results are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

shared conserved domains
after identifying homologs between mouse and viral proteins, we next asked if the similarities between homologs based on whole-sequence similarities are biased to some specific domains. to further analyze the structure of homolog similarities, we performed psi-blast searches of both mouse and viral proteins against the cdd database and identified shared conserved domains.  <dig>  cdd domains  were shared between at least one pair of mouse and viral proteins. the most frequently shared cdd domain was integrin-linked kinase , which has been linked to mammary tumor progression  <cit>  and was found in  <dig>  and  <dig> mouse and viral proteins, respectively. out of  <dig> most frequently shared cdd domains, nine were kinases and eight contained ankyrin repeats.  <dig> cdd domains matched to more than  <dig>  mouse proteins, and  <dig> % of these were kinases. to systematically identify the characteristics of shared conserved domains, we compared the frequencies of the words in annotations between shared cdds and non-shared cdds . the words most well-representing the shared cdds were related to serine/threonine kinases  and protein tyrosine kinases  followed by gt <dig> family of glycosyltransferases  and the ccx motif involved in various rab subfamilies .

mouse-specific viruses
among the  <dig> mouse-infecting viruses,  <dig> proteins from  <dig> species had at least one mouse homolog. as listed in table  <dig>  among the  <dig> species, murid herpesvirus  <dig>  had the largest number  of mouse homologs, followed by moloney murine leukemia virus and friend murine leukemia virus. there were  <dig> retroviruses most of which had mouse homologs related to retrotransposon-like gene products.

we present a summary of results for muhv- <dig> in table  <dig>  on the one hand, some proteins such as the large tegument protein matched mouse proteins at relatively low-complexity regions. although there may be biological meaning of these matches, their interpretation requires careful examination. on the other hand, proteins such as membrane protein g <dig>  and complement control proteins  are known to interfere with the mouse immune system  <cit> . other proteins such as tegument serine/threonine protein kinase  <cit> , cyclin and e <dig> ubiquitin ligase mir <dig> may be used to hijack the mouse signal transduction system, as discussed below.

genes induced by innate immune responses abundant in musvirus db
as discussed above, musvirus contains proteins with various biochemical annotations. we next asked whether musvirus hits are related by their biological functions as well. since database annotations of biological function are less complete than those of biochemical functions, we grouped proteins by their corresponding gene expression levels in stimulated immune cells. specifically, we examined expression levels of genes induced in the innate immune and adaptive immune responses. animal hosts provoke pleiotropic immune responses to limit viral dissemination when infected with viruses. in the course of the response, many genes are induced, not only as mediators of antiviral signaling such as type i ifn genes and proinflammatory cytokines, but also cell-intrinsic effectors such as gtpase mx <dig>  rnase isg <dig>  the sam domain protein viperin, and the zinc finger protein zap <dig>  <cit> . as shown above, and discussed elsewhere, viruses have many proteins homologous to such host factors. it is highly likely that such viral proteins mimic antiviral effectors induced in host cells upon viral infection.

to test this hypothesis, microarray data from mouse gm-csf-induced dendritic cells stimulated with the toll-like receptor  <dig>  ligand lipopolysaccharide , the tlr <dig> ligand pam3csk <dig> , or newcastle disease virus  were analyzed. probes whose expression levels changed  <dig> fold or more, and  <dig>  fold or less, were denoted “3-fold” and “ <dig> -fold” sets, respectively. the 3-fold set represented a set of genes induced or suppressed after stimulation, and thus directly or indirectly involved in innate immunity. in contrast, the  <dig> -fold-set represents genes whose expression levels do not change upon stimulation. by using observed gene expression levels in this way we avoided the errors associated with incomplete functional annotations that would compromise statistics derived from database queries.

each set corresponded to a list of affymetrix identifiers, which could be directly uploaded to musvirus. a utility script was prepared that converted the resulting output to a table that could easily be imported into 3rd party software.

we first computed the numbers of musvirus hits for each gene in each set. as shown in table  <dig>  the 3-fold sets of lps and ndv stimulation had significantly higher mean numbers of viral homologs than the corresponding  <dig> -fold sets, whereas the 3-fold set of pam stimulation had only marginal difference. virus and lps but not pam induce an irf-dependent antiviral signaling pathway  <cit> . thus this result suggests that genes induced or reduced by antiviral signaling are preferentially mimicked by viruses.

this result next prompted us to ask if viruses are more likely to contain genes involved in the innate antiviral response rather than the adaptive immune response. to address this question microarray data from t cells stimulated via t cell receptors were examined. two sets, 3-fold and  <dig> -fold, were prepared as above, and checked for the numbers of hits in musvirus. we found that the mean value of the t cell 3-fold set and that of the t cell  <dig> -fold set were statistically comparable, indicating that viruses preferentially mimic genes involved in innate but not acquired immune response. when we examined the conserved domains present in the ndv 3-fold set that has  <dig> or more viral hits, we found that most  belonged to the kinase family, consistent with the overview above. other families consisted of proteins involved in ubiquitination , transcription factors , proteases , helicases  and phosphatases .

using musvirus to search for proteins with known biochemical function
in this section we demonstrate how to search for proteins using keywords that map to specific biochemical functions. for the following we used mode- <dig> , as described in the methods “sequence comparison” subsection. we focused on several functional classes of proteins that are known to affect host immune response. these included kinases, cytokines and their receptors, as well as proteins involved in ubiquitination.

kinases
viruses often encode kinases to control viral growth by regulating viral gene expression, dna synthesis, and tissue tropism. searching with the entire “viral” db for the word “kinase” resulted in  <dig> hits,  <dig> with mouse-virus homologs. by restricting the search to virus with “kinase” in the annotation field,  <dig> hits with homologs in mouse were found. by restricting the search to those with homologs, we expect to increase the chance of finding example where the acquired gene is used to exploit host signaling pathways for propagation or to subvert host immune responses.

herpesviruses are known to possess many conserved kinases. using the terms “kinase” and “herpesvirus” resulted in  <dig> hits with mouse-virus homologs. if we restricted the search to the functional annotations,  <dig> hits with homologs were returned. herpes simplex virus  had  <dig> kinase hit us <dig>  <cit> , which was found by the above search criteria in musvirus. us <dig>  had  <dig> hits in musvirus, most of which were other annotated kinases. the alignment between ul <dig> and the cyclin-dependent kinase-like  <dig> protein cdkl <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  these homologs could not be identified by conventional blast searches, but were identified by using psi-blast, employed in musvirus. ul <dig> is reported to phosphorylate host ef-1delta, ck-iibeta, and the large subunit of rna polymerase ii  <cit> . they are also reported to be substrates of kinases of the cdk family  <cit> , suggesting that viral and host kinases may share substrate specificity. these collectively indicate that musvirus offers a convenient way to identify homologues, which could not easily be identified by typical sequence homology search engines, and enabled putative functional annotations, such as kinase substrate specificity, for some viral proteins.

cytokine receptors
an important signaling molecule targeted by viruses for molecular mimicry is tumor necrosis factor , which plays an essential role in orchestrating the response to pathogen invasion  <cit> . viruses target tnf levels in various ways, including expression of soluble tnf-binding molecules that mimic tnf receptor   <cit> . performing the search “tumor necrosis factor receptor” over “cdd annotations” with the option “virus centered proteins” resulted in  <dig> hits were found with mouse-virus homology. the top hits include the crmd protein in the cowpox virus, which attenuates inflammatory responses in the mouse intestine  <cit> , and the m-t <dig> protein from myxoma virus, which blocks both tnf and virus-induced apoptosis  <cit> . searching the viral-centered database with “require mouse-virus homology” disabled using the key words “interferon and receptor'' yielded  <dig> viral protein hits. among them,  <dig> viral proteins showed highest similarity to the mouse interferon gamma receptor  <dig> , but other proteins related to interferon or chemokine regulations were also found. the alignment between the soluble ifn-g receptor from deerpox virus and the mouse interferon gamma receptor  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  there may exist many other potential targets for viruses to interfere with the mouse cytokine regulatory system besides those annotated as interferon receptors.

cytokines
viruses target cytokines and chemokines directly, through molecular mimicry, and also indirectly by targeting upstream or downstream regulators in cytokine/chemokine-mediated pathways  <cit> . chemokines and cytokines are attractive targets for acquisition by viruses since they can affect a broad range of host defense responses, including intra and inter cellular signaling, chemotaxis, and cell death. they are also efficiently stored in dna viral genomes due to their small size. the most studied viruses that encode homologs of host cytokines are herpesvirues. when the search “cytokine” not “receptor” was performed against the viral-centered database with “require mouse-virus homology” disabled,  <dig> hits were found, most of which were dsdna viruses . the top hit was to a putative cc-type chemokine u <dig> in human herpesvirus 6b, which, is also found in the 6a strain and functions as a chemoattractant for monocytes  <cit> .

ubiquitin-related proteins
some viruses manipulate their hosts' ubiquitin system for their propagation  <cit> . some ubiquitin-like proteins in viruses such as usp <dig> protect other viral proteins from ubiquitination in the host cell and suppress nf-κb signaling. searching cdd annotations for viral proteins with the keyword ''ubiquitin'' identified  <dig> mouse-virus homolog hits, mostly to e <dig> ubiquitin ligases. ubiquitin e <dig> ligase-like proteins are known to be involved in processes such as activation of viral and cellular genes, degradation of receptor molecules , as well as suppression of innate immunity. among such ubiquitin e <dig> ligase-like proteins,  <dig> infected cell protein  <dig>  from various herpesviruses were found in musvirus and they were indeed homologous to many mouse proteins containing the ring finger motif.

recently, a number of examples of viruses acquiring genes involved in host defense have been described  <cit> . together, these cases studies provide crucial information about regulation of the animal immune system. the purpose of musvirus is to provide a platform where researchers can systematically search for functionally relevant homologous relationships between animal virus and host genes. musvirus was designed to operate on the level of protein domains in order to make biochemical functional interpretation of results as unambiguous as possible.

as the examples in this study show, musvirus hits cover various functional classes of proteins exploited by viruses. in order to be useful as a tool for functional prediction and discovery, we included mapping between dna microarray identifiers and mouse proteins. our investigation of gene expression data in dendritic cells stimulated with several ligands  indicate that there is a significant difference in the number of host acquired genes differentially expressed during the innate immune response compared to genes whose expression levels do not change. interestingly, we could classify such genes as belonging particularly to a viral  as opposed to an antibacterial innate immune response . analysis of gene expression in t cells indicates that viruses are more likely to acquire genes involved in innate immune responses than that in acquired immune response.

although we have focused on mouse as a host species of animal viruses in this study, the present approach is readily applicable to other host species such as humans. by compiling databases analogous to musvirus for various host species, it may help to elucidate universality as well as intricate diversity of viral infection, host defense mechanisms and their interplay. indeed, the above hits to mouse kinases , and cytokine receptors  all had human orthologs.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, musvirus captures the preference of viruses to mimic proteins involved in acute antiviral immune responses presumably because viruses take advantage of these proteins to suppress host immune system for survival and dissemination. we believe that this database will benefit research in both immunology and virology by providing a vehicle for functional insights on various genes.
