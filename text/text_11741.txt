BACKGROUND
phic <dig> integrase, originally isolated from streptomyces lividans, is widely used for non-viral gene delivery and vector integration  <cit> . phic <dig> integrase mediated integration leads to prolonged gene expression and has been used for correction of disease models  <cit> . however, it has been reported that phic <dig> integrase can lead to genomic deletions, chromosomal rearrangements and chromosomal instability  <cit> . in mouse cells it was recently shown that the integrase does lead to imprecise deletion of self excision cassettes  <cit> . in cell lines, phic31-mediated integration of plasmid dna may be accompanied by chromosomal rearrangements in the mammalian host genome with a frequency up to 15%  <cit> . the mechanisms involved are unknown, but it has been speculated that cryptic phic <dig> attachment sites recombine leading to chromosomal translocations  <cit> . in contrast to this, the system for transposon-directed genomic integration facilitated by the transposase sleeping beauty apparently does not cause chromosomal aberrations  <cit> . in order to assess the mechanistic and potential harmful effects of cellular expression of phic <dig> integrase and sleeping beauty we have studied the immediate dna damage responses and the long-term effect of induction of genomic rearrangements.

RESULTS
generation of primary human fibroblasts expressing phic <dig> integrase
in gene transfer applications, the phic <dig> integrase mediates the integration of plasmids bearing an attb site into sequences with partial sequence identity to attp . primary adult human fibroblasts were co-transfected with the plasmids pbabepuro or pbabepuroatt, containing the 285-base pair attb sequence, in combination with the plasmid pcmv-int encoding the phic <dig> integrase. transfections were performed in combination with a 3: <dig> molar excess of pcmv-int compared to the pbabepuro/pbabepuroatt plasmids in order to increase the likelihood that pcmv-int plasmids were integrated in the genome. after puromycin selection, dna and rna were isolated for pcr analysis using primers specific for the integrase gene. in this analysis clear signals were detected from puromycin selected cells transfected the pcmv-int plasmid showing that the integrase is exclusively present and expressed in cells transfected with pcmv-int .

cytogenetic analysis
the karyotypes of puromycin selected cells are shown in table  <dig> . cells transfected with pbabepuro or pbabepuroatt alone had normal karyotypes. in contrast, abnormal karyotypes including aneuploidy and deletions were found in cells co-transfected with the pcmv-int plasmids confirming our previous results with primary embryonic cells  <cit> . the data in table  <dig>  right column show evaluation of effect of expression of the sleeping beauty transposase, as will be described below.

number of cells analysed  are indicated in parentheses. *the expression cassettes for sb or mutant sb  were cloned into the pbabepuro plasmid. metaphase chromosomes were analyzed by standard q-banding techniques. the description of chromosome aberrations was based on the recommendations of the international system for human cytogenetic nomenclature .

analysis of histone h2ax phosphorylation
the histone h2ax is a key protein of the cellular response to dna damage and becomes rapidly phosphorylated in response to dna damage  <cit> . phosphorylated h2ax can be detected using immunofluorescence leading to clear and distinct nuclear staining . normal human dermal fibroblasts  treated with colcemide, serving as a positive control  <cit> , or transfected with pbabepuro or pbabepuro+pcmv-int were analysed for h2ax phosphorylation at various times after transfection. as seen in fig. 1b, cells transfected with pbabepuro+pcmv-int show an approx.  <dig> fold increase in the number of nuclei positive for h2ax phosphorylation three days after the treatment. this is comparable to the number of stained nuclei resulting from colcemide treatment. cells only transfected with the control plasmid pbabepuro showed no increase in the fraction of cells positive for h2ax phosphorylation. the increase was detected in cells transfected with both plasmids pcmv-int and pbabepuroint, but not after transfection with mutant phic <dig> genes . the upregulated h2ax phosphorylation was confirmed by western blotting analysis . here, in cells transfected with pbabepuro in combination with pcmv-int  or one plasmid containing gene expression cassettes for both puromycin-resistance and integrase  clear bands representing phoshorylated h2ax is detected. band intensity is comparable to cells treated with colcemide , whereas cells transfected with the control plasmids pbabepuro alone  or plasmids expressing an inactive mutant variant integrase, pbabepuro+pcmv-mint  and pbabepuromint  show only weak bands of gamma-h2ax.

using immunofluorescence the degree of h2ax phosporylation was scored by an arbitrary range ranking of staining intensities. score  <dig> was defined as the very intensive nuclear staining, score  <dig> intermediate, and score  <dig> being the faint but yet defined nuclear staining . nhdf cells transfected with pcmv-int had significantly more cells positive for h2ax phosphorylation scored as  <dig> and  <dig> compared to non-transfected cells . immunofluorescence analysis of transfected cells did not reveal upregulation of p <dig> and p <dig>  and early markers for apoptosis were not significantly upregulated . collectively, these results suggest that active phic <dig> integrase leads to a dna damage response in transfected nhdf cells.

analysis of possible effects of expression of sb transposase
plasmids encoding wildtype and mutant sb transposase were co-transfected with pbabepuro and the cells subsequently selected in puromycin. after drug selection the chromosomes were analysed using g-banding. as seen in table  <dig>  all puromycin selected cells had normal chromosomes. after transient transfection the sb transposase resulted in lower levels of h2ax phosphorylation compared to cells transfected with the phic <dig> integrase plasmids measured by immunofluorescence .

altogether we have shown that the phic <dig> integrase induces chromosome rearrangements in primary human adult cells confirming our previous results using primary human embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> . the observed effects take place even in the absence of donor plasmids containing attb sequences indicating that the effects are caused by the integrase enzyme directly. furthermore we show that the phic <dig> integrase, in contrast to the sb transposase, leads to significant up-regulation of h2ax phosphorylation. interestingly, immunofluorescence staining reveal numerous bright spots in the nucleus in a pattern similar to that observed when cells are treated with colcemide, which causes dna damage in multiple loci. h2ax phosphorylation leads to recruitment of repair factors to damaged dna  <cit>  and efficient homologous recombinational repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks  <cit>  independent of p <dig>  <cit> .

h2ax phosphorylation was observed already  <dig> days after transfection, whereas the abnormal karyotypes were measured after drug selection . the inducible phic <dig> integrase system described recently may be used to establish whether the two events, dna damage and chromosome rearrangements, are causally linked  <cit> . moreover, the dosage dependent effects of integrase are still unknown and need to be further clarified. our findings highlight the importance of screening for chromosomal rearrangements in mammalian cells and investigation of the genetic and phenotypic consequences.

CONCLUSIONS
in primary human adult fibroblasts phic <dig> integrase leads to a dna damage response and chromosomal aberrations. our findings have important implications for gene therapy approaches based on phic <dig> emphasising that safety issues for gene therapy approaches need to be carefully addressed.
