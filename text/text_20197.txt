BACKGROUND
fungi belonging to the genus fusarium are very diverse and occupy a wide variety of ecological niches. the genus is divided into several distinct species complexes, each with many species  <cit> . for example, the fusarium oxysporum species complex is composed of a variety of species including plant and animal pathogens, decomposers and soil fungi . the genomes of at least ten f. oxysporum isolates were sequenced in an attempt to delineate the genetic basis of niche specialization, and lineage specific regions within the genome were demonstrated to be important for pathogenicity in plants. for example, a supernumerary chromosome identified in f. oxysporum harbors virulence genes that confer pathogenicity to tomato  <cit> .

in this study, we focused our attention on closely related individuals from the fusarium graminearum species complex, which cause fusarium head blight  disease of wheat. the species complex composed of several distinct species, including f. graminearum, f. asiaticum, and f. meridionale  <cit> . the genome of f. graminearum isolate ph- <dig> was the first genome available from the species complex, and has been re-examined as additional information on gene and genome structure has become available . there have also been some large-scale genomics studies that have used this genome as a reference to study different biological phenomenon, such as genome wide association analyses of snps, as well as analyses of recombination events by restriction site associated dna sequencing  <cit> . few studies have explored the genetic diversity of members of the f. graminearum species complex by performing whole genome assembly and comparative genetics; studies were largely focused on f. graminearum sensu stricto – a single lineage within the complex  <cit> .

as part of the infection process, these fungi produce trichothecene mycotoxins that contribute to disease progression and accumulate in infected plant tissues  <cit> . the toxicity of fusarium trichothecenes makes contaminated crops unsafe for consumption by animals  <cit> . the economic losses resulting from reductions in crop yield and grain quality has prompted significant amounts of research into understanding the genetic basis of toxin production by these fungi, which has been largely facilitated by the available genomic sequence of f. graminearum isolate ph- <dig>  <cit> . phenotypic variations in toxin production, pathology on different hosts, development and morphology, and growth differences have been reported both among and between species of the f. graminearum species complex . currently, the only well-established virulence factor contributing to disease in wheat by f. graminearum and closely related species are the trichothecene mycotoxins  <cit> . allelic differences in genes as well as large-scale changes have been reported for the trichothecene gene cluster, with some genes occurring outside of the main cluster in separate regions of the genome  <cit> . for example, allelic differences in the biosynthetic gene tri <dig> are attributed to structural variation in the trichothecene deoxynivalenol , namely 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol  and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol   <cit> . similarly, allelic variation in tri <dig> is associated with the production of the alternate trichothecene nx- <dig>  while tri <dig> and tri <dig> are associated with production of the trichothecene nivalenol  <cit> . although differences in genes that contribute to trichothecene variation are known, our current knowledge of other factors that lead to variations in disease profiles remains largely unknown. information gathered from sequences of additional members of the f. graminearum species complex will lead to a better understanding of the genetic variations between isolates that are associated with reported phenotypic diversity.

this study reports on genomic and genetic differences among ten closely related members of the f. graminearum species complex that cause fhb. six isolates were newly sequenced as part of this study  and four were sequenced previously   <cit> . nrrl  <dig>  isolated from barley in japan, was reported to be non-pathogenic in wheat and was categorized as f. asiaticum  <cit> . nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  and nrrl  <dig> were isolated from maize in nepal. while nrrl  <dig> belongs to the species f. asiaticum, nrrl  <dig> is of the related species f. meridionale, and the species classification for nrrl  <dig> is still unclear and has been suggested to be a species hybrid  . further investigation with additional markers suggested that this isolate may be in a basal group within the f. asiaticum clade or belong within f. meridionale  <cit> . the isolates ph- <dig>  daom  <dig>  daom  <dig>  daom  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  and cs  <dig> belong to f. graminearum sensu stricto. with the exception of cs  <dig>  which was isolated in australia, all other isolates were isolated in north america  <cit> . ph- <dig> and daom  <dig> were isolated from maize, nrrl  <dig>  daom  <dig>  and daom  <dig> were isolated from wheat, and cs  <dig> was isolated from barley. both the trichothecene chemotype and pathology on wheat for each isolate has been reported  .table  <dig> description of fusarium isolates used in this study

methods
fusarium isolates, sequencing, and genome assembly
the isolates nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  and nrrl  <dig> were obtained from the collection at the centraalbureau voor schimmelcultures , in the netherlands, while isolates nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  and daom <dig> were obtained from the collection at the department of agriculture mycology , in canada. nrrl accession numbers are from the united states department of agriculture’s agriculture research service culture collection. total dna was isolated from all the nrrl fusarium isolates:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the daom isolate  <dig> by the e.z.n.a. fungal dna mini kit . dna was sequenced according to manufacturer instructions using 74 bp reads from paired-end libraries by illumina gaii sequencing. the sequencing reactions were performed by the center for the analysis of genome evolution and function  at the university of toronto, canada. sequence reads were imported into clc genomics workbench. prior to de novo assembly, reads were trimmed and short reads <20 bp were removed. assemblies were optimized for contig length by adjusting the ‘word size’ parameter and keeping all other parameters at default settings. the optimal word sizes were determined to be  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  and daom  <dig>  respectively. average contig coverage was determined for each genome assembly and contigs that was 75% or lower than the average contig coverage and contigs shorter than 200 bp were removed from the assembly. the contigs were then reordered to the genome sequence of ph- <dig> from the mips database v <dig>  by abacas  <cit> . the ordered contig sequences were uploaded to the genbank database at ncbi .table  <dig> genome and assembly statistics of fusarium isolates used in this study

bgenomes were sequenced using sanger, illumina hiseq  <dig>  and illumina gaii sequencing for cuomo  <dig>  <cit> , gardiner  <dig>  <cit> , and walkowiak  <dig>  <cit> , respectively




genomic alignments
the newly sequenced genomes, genome for ph- <dig> , and sequences for cs  <dig>  daom  <dig> and daom  <dig> that were obtained from genbank at ncbi were all used in separate pairwise genome alignments using the nucmer and promer algorithms in the software package mummer  <cit> . nucmer is designed for aligning highly conserved regions of dna, while promer aligns more divergent sequences. since all matching and alignment routines are performed on the six frame amino acid translation of the dna input sequence promer is more sensitive than nucmer.

nucmer was also used to extract the snp and indel data, which was obtained by default parameters of the 1-to- <dig> algorithm in dnadiff  <cit> . for each reference genome, the number of snps in each of the genomes was summed and averaged for each of the species to represent an average for each species. snps within conserved regions of the genome were obtained from panseq with the following parameters: run mode = pan, fragment size =  <dig>  percent identity cut-off =  <dig> and core genome threshold =  <dig>   <cit> . the resultant snp alignment was imported into clc genomics workbench for phylogenetic analyses using the maximum likelihood phylogeny tool, and the phylogeny constructed by the neighbor joining method and jukes cantor substitution model using  <dig> replicates; the bootstrap values at all nodes were 100%.

construction of pan and accessory genomes
pan genome consists of full complement of genes from all ten genomes. the list was started by including all the genes from ph- <dig>  then, genes from other genomes were compared to the current pan genome with blastn and added if the e-value was > 1e- <dig>  the software program augustus was used to predict genes from the six newly sequenced genomes  <cit> . the percentage alignment to ph- <dig> by mummer was used to select the order in which genomes were selected to contribute to the pan genome list going from greatest percent alignment to lowest. genes in the pan genome that did not originate from ph- <dig> were annotated by blast-2-go using default parameters, which identified similar sequences in databases at ncbi, gene families/domains , and gene ontology   <cit> . the accessory genome was created by comparing genes from the pan genome to each genome and included if they had a blastn e-value >1e- <dig> in at least one genome.

analysis of sequence variation within genes
for the analysis of sequence variation within genes, the number of positions that contained snps and indels from the dnadiff analysis in mummer were tabulated for the full length of the sequence for each gene. orthologues of select ph- <dig> genes in the other genomes were obtained by blastn. the orthologues were aligned by muscle using default parameters  <cit> . genes containing a single orthologue in each genome were examined for nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates by prank with the -codon -f options  <cit> . we then used codeml to fit the m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> models to study the overall nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio  of these genes  <cit> . m <dig> is used to estimate global dn/ds ratios, while m <dig> and m <dig> are separate models that are compared and a likelihood ratio test showing the preference of m <dig> constitutes evidence of adaptive evolution  <cit> .

RESULTS
genome assembly information and statistics
we performed whole genome sequencing of six fungal isolates  from the f. graminearum species complex that are associated with fhb disease in plants . the newly sequenced genomes, along with four previously sequenced isolates, were selected based on their incidence in various geographical locations, taxonomy/species, host isolation, toxin production and pathology  <cit>  . overall, the ten sequenced genomes were comparable in size and structure when compared to the four previously characterized chromosomes of isolate ph- <dig>   <cit> . the sizes of the ten genomes ranged from approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. the n <dig> values is defined as the contig length such that using equal or longer contigs produces half the bases of the genome, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb for the six genomes sequenced by illumina platforms; the genome coverages ranged from 32x to 144x .

whole genome alignments of ten fusarium pathogens within the f. graminearum complex
to determine the degree of overlap among the ten genomes, we performed genome alignments of the ten genomes with one another  and with  <dig> genomes of other plant pathogenic fungi using the nucmer and promer algorithms in the software package mummer,   <cit> . a direct pairwise comparison with the sequence aligner nucmer, which is designed for the alignment of closely related sequences, revealed at least  <dig> % sequence alignment among the six f. graminearum genomes . similarly, when the two f. asiaticum genomes  were compared,  <dig> % of the genomes aligned. lastly, a comparison between the two f. meridionale genomes  revealed a  <dig> % alignment between them . when we aligned the genomes of different species, f. graminearum and f. asiaticum had at least  <dig> % sequence alignment, f. graminearum and f. meridionale had at least  <dig> % sequence alignment, and f. asiaticum and f. meridionale had at least  <dig> % sequence alignment. the ten genomes had between  <dig>  and  <dig> % alignment to f. pseudograminearum and  <dig> – <dig> % alignment to f. langsethiae, but only  <dig> – <dig> % aligned to other fusarium genomes, and < 1% alignment to genomes from other plant pathogenic fungi .fig.  <dig> high concordance between genome alignments and taxonomy. whole genomes were aligned between ten closely related isolates of f. graminearum, f. asiaticum, and f. meridionale, as well as  <dig> other fusaria, individuals from  <dig> different ascomycete genera, and individuals from  <dig> different basidiomycete genera. alignments were performed using two different algorithms, ‘nucmer’ , which is designed for alignment of related sequences, and ‘promer’ , which is designed for alignment of distantly related sequences. genomes are arranged by species; f. graminearum , f. asiaticum , and f. meridionale . a non-linear full spectrum heat map is used to represent the percentage alignment to each query genome, where red has the lowest alignment and violet has the greatest alignment




analysis with promer, which is designed for the alignment of distantly related sequences, yielded results similar to those of nucmer in pairwise comparisons of the ten genomes to one another and to f. pseudograminearum and f. langsethiae . however, the alignment to other fusarium species increased from  <dig> – <dig>  to  <dig> – <dig> %. alignment to other phytopathogenic ascomycetes increased from <1% to  <dig> – <dig> %, and alignment to phytopathogenic basidiomycetes remained lower at  <dig> – <dig> % . the concordance observed between genomes from our pairwise alignments agrees with taxonomic phylogenies suggested that f. graminearum, f. asiaticum, and f. meridionale are more closely related, while f. pseudograminearum and f. langsethiae are more distantly related, and that other fusaria belong to even more distant taxonomic groups, followed by other genera and other phyla . this agrees with the established evolutionary relationships suggested by other research studies  <cit> .

in addition to analyzing genetic overlap by direct pairwise alignments, we also identified snps and indels in all genomes, which were used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree . we used panseq to identify a total of  <dig>  snps and indels that differed among the ten genomes  <cit> . as observed, the ten isolates arranged according to their previously reported species assignments and were in agreement with the pairwise alignment data . together, the data indicate that ph- <dig>  daom  <dig>  daom  <dig>  daom  <dig>  cs  <dig>  and nrrl  <dig> are f. graminearum sensu stricto, while nrrl  <dig> and nrrl  <dig> are f. asiaticum  <cit>  . the phylogeny also supports our pairwise genome alignment data which indicated that nrrl  <dig> is more closely related to nrrl  <dig> and may correspond to f. meridionale . interestingly, the two f. graminearum isolates that produce the trichothecene 3-adon  form a distinct genetic group from the four isolates that produce 15-adon  . this supports claims that individuals from these two chemotypes  belong to distinctly separate genetic populations  <cit> . the f. graminearum isolate cs  <dig>  originating from australia grouped in the same phylogenetic group as the other 15-adon producers from north america, implying that it may belong to the same genetic population .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of fhb pathogens by whole genome alignment. a snp and indel alignment of conserved genomic regions was performed by panseq and was used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogeny by neighbor joining using  <dig> replicates. http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/tb2:s20221?x-accesscode=7489a1a68445a29618a659d472297db8&format=html





regions of genomic variability in fhb fungi
to visualize the genomic regions with sequence differences, the genomes were organized into 100 kb sections and the average number of snps and indels in the genomes of each species were plotted across the length of the four chromosomes using ph- <dig> as a reference . generally, we observed that the average number of snps and indels were fewer within the species  than genomes from f. asiaticum  and f. meridionale  . when a genome from a separate species was used as a reference, we observed that snps and indels were generally fewer in genomes within the same species than between genomes from different species . overall, we observed averages of 105–189 kb of snps and indels when comparing genomes from the same species and 796–893 kb of snps and indels when comparing genomes from different species. sequence variation was co-localized at the ends of chromosomes and select regions within chromosomes, similar to what has been reported previously  <cit> . in addition, we also observed islands of increased nucleotide variation in specific genomes. for example, in the genomes of cs  <dig>  nrrl  <dig>  and nrrl  <dig>  we observed regions where the nucleotide variations increased compared to most other genomes .fig.  <dig> genome sequence and gene content variability in ph- <dig> compared to other isolates. snps/indels and absent genes between genomes were determined separately, by whole genome alignments and blastn using ph- <dig> as a reference. the number of snps and indels per 100 kb were averaged for each species and are presented separately for f. graminearum , f. asiaticum , and f. meridionale . positions of absent genes whose sequences had a lowest expected value > 1e- <dig> by blastn for at least one member of the species are presented as sysnpsols; f. graminearum , f. asiaticum , and f. meridionale . chromosomes are demarked by vertical dashed lines





there is preponderance of evidence to suggest that niche adaptation, toxin production, and disease outcomes are attributed to differences in gene content and variation within genes . we were interested to know if nucleotide variations were associated with genes absent among the ten genomes. augustus was used to predict genes from the six genomes and gene sequences for isolates ph- <dig>  daom  <dig>  daom  <dig> and cs  <dig> were obtained from previous studies  <cit> . gene conservation was determined by blastn using similar approaches to other studies  <cit> ; genes were considered absent if they had the expected value > 1e- <dig> compared to other genomes. our analysis showed that regardless of the reference genome, genes that are absent in f. graminearum , f. meridionale , and f. asiaticum  were all located in regions with high snps and indels . we also identified genes that were unique to each isolate , which were also localized to regions of increased nucleotide variability .

construction of the pan and accessory genomes of the fusarium species complex
we constructed a pan genome by reiteratively appending genes of the ph- <dig> isolate from other genomes based on blastn expected values . this non-redundant gene list contained a total of  <dig>  genes . of the  <dig>  genes in the pan-genome 12% or  <dig> genes had blastn hits with expected values > 1e- <dig> in at least one genome and was considered to be part of the accessory genome . the accessory genome contributes to the genetic variability within and among species and might encode biochemical functions that are not essential for fusarium growth, but confer selective advantages, such as adaptation to different niches or colonization of a new host  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the accessory genome is a susbset of the pan-genome. the pan-genome, which incorporates the genes from all ten genomes, is composed of  <dig>  genes,  <dig> of which are accessory genes that are not conserved in all genomes. the accessory genome further divides into genes that are specific to each species, with  <dig> genes specific to f. graminearum ,  <dig> specific to f. meridionale , and  <dig> specific to f. asiaticum 




the accessory genome was further parsed into genes that are unique to a species or to each isolate . analyses identified a total of  <dig> species-specific genes that were present in all six f. graminearum isolates, but were absent in all genomes of the other two species . similarly, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> species-specific genes were found in f. meridionale and f. asiaticum, respectively . analysis of the accessory genome also revealed genes that are present in a single isolate, but absent in others . we observed between  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes in each of the ten isolates . in contrast, the f. asiaticum isolate nrrl  <dig> had the most number of “uniquely absent” genes  and this isolate has been reported to be unable to infect wheat  <cit> .table  <dig> isolate-specific genes identified from accessory genome


auniquely present genes were considered present in the genome of the isolate and absent in genomes of all other isolates; absence was determined by having a blastn hit with the lowest expected value > 1e- <dig> in the genome of the isolate


buniquely absent genes were considered absent in the genomes of the isolate and present in the genomes of all other isolates; absence was determined by having a blastn hit with the lowest expected value > 1e- <dig> in the genome of the isolate




the accessory genome reveals species and isolate-specific genes potentially involved in secondary metabolism and disease
functional enrichment analyses of 105 f. graminearum-specific genes,  <dig> of which were originally identified in ph- <dig> by the mips funcat database revealed  <dig> genes or 80% as unclassified. the remaining  <dig> genes were enriched in metabolic and defense pathways . the genes involved in defense included two aldehyde dehydrogenases, fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig>  as well as fgsg_ <dig> encoding a protein similar to pisatin demethylase cytochrome p <dig>  pisatin is a phytoalexin produced by plants as a defense molecule; detoxification of pisatin has been demonstrated by the action of demethylase genes from f. solani  <cit> . analysis of  <dig> genes specific to f. asiaticum included secondary metabolic genes such as a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  aps <dig>  which is involved in apicidin biosynthesis, and a polyketide synthase  pks <dig> associated with w <dig> biosynthesis   <cit> . there were also  <dig> genes specific to f. meridionale and a gene  is annotated as a ‘pectin lyase fold virulence factor’ implicated in cell wall catabolism   <cit> . twelve heterokaryon or vegetative incompatibility genes were also identified as being species-specific; these gene classes are known to diversify in fungi and may have roles in speciation  <cit> .table  <dig> secondary metabolic genes are part of accessory genome

agene was present in the genome of at least one isolate of f. graminearum , f. asiaticum , or f. meridionale 




our functional analysis was extended to isolate-specific genes. of the  <dig> genes from the accessory genome, 12– <dig> genes were present in a single isolate and were considered unique to that isolate . the function of unique genes spanned a wide range of categories, including primary, secondary metabolism, as well as signal transduction. examples include a glutamine synthase  from nrrl  <dig> and a non-ribosomal peptide synthase  from nrrl  <dig> . among the  <dig> genes unique to nrrl  <dig>  nine are predicted to have kinase functions and could be involved in signal transduction . a kinase unique to ph- <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  has been disrupted and resulted in reduced don production  <cit> .

genes that were uniquely absent in an isolate were also analysed . the isolate nrrl  <dig> was reported to have limited virulence in wheat and contained the most number of uniquely absent genes . these included two genes categorized by mips to be involved in cell rescue, defense and virulence, namely fgsg_ <dig> predicted to encode a chitinase, and fgsg_ <dig> with potential kinase function. the kinase fgsg_ <dig> was previously target by reverse genetics, but no phenotype was observed in the mutant  <cit> . another gene, fgsg_ <dig> that was absent in the nrrl  <dig> genome was predicted to be involved in isoprenoid metabolism, potentially contributing to secondary metabolic pathways .

our analysis also showed that some of the genes in the accessory genome had irregular patterns of gene conservation across the ten genomes; many of these genes were associated with secondary metabolism . examples include fgsg_ <dig>  a gene encoding polyketide synthase , which was absent in both f. asiaticum genomes but was present in all f. graminearum and f. meridionale isolates . mutation of pks <dig> in f. graminearum showed reduced mycelial growth and a defect in virulence  <cit> . a polyketide cyclase, fgsg_ <dig> showed poor conservation in both f. meridionale isolates, but was present in f. graminearum and f. asiaticum isolates  <cit> . another example includes gene g <dig> from nrrl  <dig> , which shares similarity with favg1_ <dig>  a gene from f. avenaceum that is present in the genomes of both f. meridionale isolates and the f. asiaticum isolate nrrl  <dig>  but is absent in all f. graminearum isolates. this gene was predicted to encode a chalcone synthase, which has been characterized in plants and is involved in the biosynthesis of defensive flavonoid compounds  <cit> . in addition to polyketide synthases, a metabolic gene g <dig> from nrrl  <dig>  shares identity with a terpene synthase gene, tri <dig>  which catalyzes the first step of trichothecene biosynthesis in f. graminearum and is essential for trichothecene biosynthesis and infection of wheat  <cit> . interestingly, g <dig> did not have a positive blastn hit to the other f. meridionale genome nrrl  <dig> but had positive blastn hits to the f. asiaticum genomes nrrl  <dig> and nrrl  <dig>  upon closer examination, g <dig> showed only  <dig> % protein identity to tri <dig> from the f. graminearum isolate ph- <dig>  but 95% protein identity to favg1_ <dig> from f. avenaceum  <cit> . a true homologue of tri <dig>  with >97% protein identity was identified in the f. meridionale isolate nrrl  <dig>  despite the low identity to tri <dig>  g <dig> was predicted to contain a tri <dig> domain by interpro and pfam . it is unclear if the protein from this gene acts on substrates from the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway and contributes to their production, or if the protein is involved in the production of other molecules.

in addition to individual genes involved in secondary metabolism, accessory genes with irregular patterns of conservation also extended to gene clusters. for example, a gene cluster composed of five genes was absent in the f. meridionale genomes, but is present in f. graminearum and f. asiaticum isolates   <cit> . the genes within this cluster include fgsg_ <dig>  which is predicted to encode a terpene synthase, fgsg_ <dig>  which encodes a putative transcription factor and three putative cytochrome p <dig> genes fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig>  <cit> . genes from this cluster have been reported to be expressed during infection in different cereal hosts  <cit> . similarly, another gene cluster  from the f. graminearum isolate cs  <dig> from australia was absent in the 15-adon producing isolates of f. graminearum from north america, but was present in all other genomes . the gene fg05_ <dig> with similarity to a polyketide synthase gene pks <dig> was also present in the f. avenaceum and f. equiseti genomes  <cit> .

in addition to the genes potentially involved in secondary metabolism, there were other genes from the accessory genome with irregular conservation patterns that have been shown to contribute to fecundity and disease by the fungi . a study that targeted transcription factors determined that accessory genes fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> contributed to disease and spore production, respectively  <cit> . a separate study that focused on kinases determined that the accessory genes fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig> all contributed to toxin production while fgsg_ <dig> contributed to spore production and disease  <cit> . disruption of a possible phosphatase regulatory subunit fgsg_ <dig> has also been shown to reduce disease accumulation  <cit> . together, the accessory genome appears to contain genes that contribute to metabolic processes, as well as other processes potentially involved in development or disease.

highly polymorphic genes in common genome include alleles, pseudogenes and genes under diversifying selection
genes not considered part of the accessory genome was identified to contain high levels of sequence variation. we identified a total of  <dig> genes that were highly variable with > <dig> snps or indel sites per kb . since  <dig> of the <dig> genes originated from ph- <dig>  the mips funcat database  was used to detect functional enrichment of gene categories . the analysis revealed that the majority of the genes  are functionally unclassified, compared to  <dig> % for all genes from ph- <dig>  functional categories that were determined to be enriched compared to the rest of the genome  included motility, energy, metabolism, and cell migration . select genes that exhibited high frequency of snps and indels were inspected in greater detail, these included tri <dig>  three putative transcription factors, two proteins with nodulin-like domains and three putative heterokaryon incompatibility genes.fig.  <dig> sequence variability within common genes. only  <dig> genes contain greater than 20% sequence variation. genetic variability of genes was assessed based on snps and indels from the genome alignments




allelic variation in tri <dig> is attributed to the production of either 15-adon or 3-adon  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment by muscle indicated that within a specific chemotype, such as 3-adon producing isolates, tri <dig> had greater than 95% sequence identity in the coding regions. comparison of the coding sequences between chemotypes showed only 84–89% sequence identity. although, no acetylated form of don has been shown to be produced by nrrl  <dig> isolate, tri <dig> from this isolate showed 97% identity to other15-adon producing isolates  <cit> . thus, high alignment of tri <dig> suggests that the high variation in this gene may be associated with allelic variation within chemotypes.

three genes fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig> that encode transcription factors have been previously targeted for functional analysis  <cit> . disruption of fgsg_ <dig> resulted in no apparent phenotypic difference in toxin production or disease, while no mutants were obtained for fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig>  <cit> . closer inspection of fgsg_ <dig> in the ten genomes revealed that the gene may have a small deletion and a premature stop codon in nrrl  <dig> and duplicate copies in daom  <dig>  the two other transcription factors fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> were subjected to diversifying selection analysis by codeml to assess overall nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution  rate of these genes. with the m <dig> model, the dn/ds ratios for fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> were estimated to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and application of the two site model  did not provide evidence of diversifying selection .

two genes encoding putative nodulin-like domains, fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig>  were also found to have high sequence variation; nodulin-like domains are often found in plant proteins and are implicated in plant-microbe interaction  <cit> . the orthologue of fgsg_ <dig> spanned a region with ambiguous nucleotides for four of the genomes or was at the very end of a contig, the gene also contained a 24 bp insertion in the two f. asiaticum genomes. the dn/ds ratio of fgsg_ <dig> was  <dig> , and the two site model indicated no evidence for adaptive evolution .

lastly, three putative heterokaryon incompatibility genes fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> with potential roles in non-self-recognition were identified to have high sequence variation  <cit> . fgsg_ <dig> was determined to have a premature stop in nrrl  <dig>  while the closest orthologue of fgsg_ <dig> in nrrl  <dig> had an identity <50 to the orthologues. analysis of diversifying selection for fgsg_ <dig> showed a dn/ds ratio of  <dig>  and was the only gene from the four investigated that showed significant evidence of adaptive evolution  by the two site model .

altogether, the increased sequence variation in select common genes may be associated with allelic variation  or mutations resulting in premature stop codons resulting in a pseudogene . in addition, fgsg_ <dig> was determined to be under adaptive evolutionary pressures that may have contributed to diversification of this gene.

fusarium head blight fungi are globally distributed and isolates are known to exhibit phenotypic diversity in their morphology, growth and development, production of toxins and other secondary metabolites, and pathogenicity towards specific hosts  <cit> . dna-based phylogenetic analyses using gene markers have allowed us to identify distinct species and genetic populations of these fungi. however, some isolates have proven difficult to classify using marker analyses and the biological mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity remain unsettled . genome sequencing of additional isolates provided the opportunity to better understand and confirm the genetic relationship between fungal isolates, and identified gene candidates that could contribute to phenotypic differences and niche adaptation. similar approaches were successfully applied to the f. oxysporum species complex; for example, genomic comparison of f. oxysporum isolates identified gene expansion that may be associated with pathogenicity towards banana, as well as genes associated with infection in melon  <cit> .

a comparative genomics approach used in this study was effective at better resolving the genetic relationship among fungal species and isolates. in pairwise alignments, the genomes of the ten closely related fusaria exhibited high levels of identity, particularly within species. the genomes from isolates of the f. graminearum species complex also had greater alignment to f. pseudograminearum and f. langsethiae, than to genomes from other fusaria, or other genera altogether. these findings confirm the previously established phylogenetic relationships among these closely related fusarium to each other and other fungi  <cit> . interestingly, on average, f. meridionale shared more genes and showed high levels of identity than f. asiaticum to f. graminearum. based on these findings, f. meridionale and f. graminearum may be more closely related than f. asiaticum and f. graminearum. in addition to providing insights into the relationships between species, we were also able to better resolve species placement of nrrl  <dig>  which was difficult to determine using marker analyses. marker analyses had suggested that nrrl  <dig> is either f. asiaticum or f. meridionale or a species hybrid . analyses of nrrl  <dig> and nrrl 28721genomes showed high level of identity . in combination of with snps and indels analyses, we suggest that nrrl  <dig> and nrrl  <dig> isolates are closely related and may be of the same species, f. meridionale . similar analyses also enabled us to separate 3-adon or 15-adon genetic populations within f. graminearum species complex that have been reported by others  <cit> .

this study provided insights into the relationships between isolates with known differences in geographical distribution, species and population backgrounds. for example, cs  <dig>  an isolate from australia grouped within the same population as the 15-adon producers in north america. this suggested that this australian isolate may be more related to the 15-adon producers rather than the 3-adon producers from north america. furthermore, the study suggests that genetic populations are globally distributed, and that geographical barriers may not play a significant role in the spread of these fungi. the presence of different species such as f. asiaticum and f. meridionale in nepal, or genetic populations of the same species, such as 3-adon and 15-adon populations of f. graminearum in north america that cause similar diseases indicates that different populations and species can coexist and may have distinguishable traits that allow them to occupy slightly different niches than other populations or species. for example, environmental and host conditions have been demonstrated to affect disease outcomes by 3-adon and 15-adon producers of f. graminearum  <cit> . further monitoring will better resolve the geographical distribution of these populations/species and the stability of the population and community structure over time. this may be particularly important when we consider the environmental consequences of climate change.

in addition to providing insights into the genetic relationship between isolates, our comparative genomics analyses also provided perspective into the conservation and evolution of genes that may contribute to phenotypic differences among these pathogens. we observed a high degree of conservation  of genes among the ten genomes; highest within species than between species . analyses of the pan genome indicated that the two 3-adon producing strains of f. graminearum  had the fewest number of absent genes . in contrast, the two f. asiaticum isolates nrrls  <dig> and  <dig> had the greatest number of absent genes,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, when compared to the pan genome . further study across additional isolates would be required to determine if there is gene expansion or loss in populations or species of these fungi.

many of the genes from the accessory genome were predicted to be involved in metabolism. this is particularly important because fusarium species are well known for their ability to make a wide array of secondary metabolites, including don, which has been studied for its role as a virulence factor during plant infection and for its toxic effects in humans  <cit> . based on the sequence, f. graminearum isolate ph- <dig> is reported to have at least  <dig> known pks genes and  <dig> known nrps and other metabolic genes  <cit> . we discovered that some of these genes, such as pks <dig>  pks <dig> and nrps <dig> that have described previously in f. graminearum are absent in some of the genomes  <cit> . we also identified genes in some of the ten genomes, such as nrps <dig>  that were previously not reported in the f. graminearum species complex   <cit> . these analyses underscore the potential importance of secondary metabolites in host and niche adaptation and future studies should focus on the discovery of metabolites produced by these enzymes.

genes to be species or isolate specific were annotated by blast-2-go based on sequence similarity to genes from other fusaria . a total of  <dig> gene sequences were annotated from the new genomes  and  <dig> or 34% of these had a top tblastx hit in f. oxysporum, while the next top hits were in f. pseudograminearum , f. graminearum , f. avenaceum , f. fujikuroi , f. solani , and f. verticillioides  . all other genus/species that had more than  <dig> % of genes blastx hits were from other fusaria or other ascomycete genera, including colletotrichum, stachybotrys, bipolaris, and pseudogymnoascus. this indicates that many genes from the accessory genome are conserved across the genus, but may be lost or acquired, depending on selective pressures from the environment or plant host. this has been previously described as an attribute of pathogen effectors that are involved in the evolutionary interactions between pathogen and host.fig.  <dig> top blastx hit of genes from the pan-genome not from ph- <dig> or cs  <dig>  the top  <dig> genus/species that match to the genes are presented in descending order and are presented as a percentage of genes; all other species/genus had less than five genes  that were a top hit to that genus/species




such conservation of accessory genes within the genus also suggest that horizontal gene transfer may play a significant role in the biology of fusarium. this is supported by our observations of genes that were absent across isolates and were co-localized in regions of the genome with increased nucleotide variability . the co-localization of divergent genetic regions and genes that are absent among related genomes is consistent with what has been reported previously for fusarium species  <cit> . co-localization may suggest that genes were acquired or lost as clusters; multiple gains or losses of gene clusters have been suggested for the secondary metabolite gene cluster responsible for fumonisin biosynthesis in fusarium  <cit> . lineage specific chromosomes and large scale horizontal gene transfer events, such as the transfer of an entire chromosome that have been reported in f. oxysporum, are yet to be reported for members of the f. graminearum species complex  <cit> . however, small scale horizontal transfer events have been suggested between f. graminearum and other fungi  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer has also been suggested between bacteria and f. pseudograminearum, which is also within the graminearum species complex and is reported to cause disease on the roots of cereals  <cit> . closer inspection of the presence, location, and orientation within the genomes of other organisms could shed light on their history and origin.

in addition to accessory genes contributing to genetic differences amongst the genomes, we also identified common genes that are variable and could contribute to niche adaptation and disease. common genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction that are recognized by the host are selected against but in some cases cannot be shed; instead, these genes modify their sequence in order to avoid recognition by the host  <cit> . our analyses identified  <dig> common genes with more than 20% sequence variability present among genomes. this included tri <dig>  which has reported allelic variation and contributes to the structural variation that exists between 3-adon and 15-adon toxins  <cit> . other genes, such as fgsg_ <dig> and fgsg_ <dig> may have acquired mutations that resulted in pre mature stop codons, resulting in pseudogenes. in addition, analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation rates of fgsg_ <dig> indicated that this gene may be under diversifying selection. a comparative analysis of three fusarium species identified genes from f. graminearum that may be under diversifying selection  <cit> . these included fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  fgsg_ <dig>  and fgsg_ <dig>  which were also identified to have >20% sequence variation between genomes in our study  <cit> . in contrast, our analyses of fgsg_ <dig> among the f. graminearum species complex did not find significant evidence for diversifying selection, possibly due to the shorter evolutionary distance between the genomes we investigated. nevertheless, further investigation of these highly variable common genes as well as the accessory genes could implicate these genes with phenotypic differences or known adaptive processes.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genomics has enabled us to place ten isolates from the f. graminearum species complex into their respective species or genetic populations. a construction of a pan and accessory genome has also given us insights into the genetic diversity among members of the f. graminearum species complex. further investigation of the roles of both accessory genes and highly variable common genes with respect to niche adaptation is required. as more genomes of this species complex become available, a larger comparative study will allow for further characterization of the genetic diversity amongst these economically important pathogenic fungi.
