BACKGROUND
cetaceans  are a group of secondarily adapted marine mammals with a history of transition from terrestrial to aquatic environments. although the exact origin and evolutionary history of cetaceans remains unclear, a widely accepted view is that their terrestrial ancestors returned to the seas around  <dig> mya  and finally diversified into a group of fully aquatic mammals  <cit> . these include nearly  <dig> species that can be subdivided into two suborders, the mysticeti  and the odontoceti , which arose from a common eocene ancestor around  <dig> mya. in spite of their variation in body size, all modern cetaceans are relatively similar in shape.

aquatic life poses numerous challenges for mammals that were originally adapted for life on land  <cit> . therefore, many features that were common in land mammals have changed in the evolutionary process that led to cetaceans. cetaceans, as a result, lack a hair coat, presumably an adaptation to reduce friction and improve locomotion, and they regulate their body temperature in energetically challenging environments for endotherms using the mechanism such as the insulating layer of adipose tissue  <cit> . moreover, the mysticetes, compared to odontocetes, lack an adult dentition but instead acquired a novel filter feeding mechanism using baleen plates to filter feed for bulky prey, and ultimately, this key specialization, permitted the evolution of gigantic body size, a hallmark of modern baleen whales .

recently, yim et al.  <cit>  reported the whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly of the minke whale genome that support the hypotheses regarding adaptation to hypoxic resistance, metabolism under limited oxygen conditions and the development of unique morphological traits. they used a high-depth male minke whale sequence  to assemble the draft genome. in addition, a high-quality draft genome and three re-sequenced genomes of baiji  were reported to reveal potential molecular adaptations of cetaceans to secondary aquatic life such as a decrease in olfactory and taste receptor genes and changes in vision and hearing genes  <cit> .

in this paper, we use novel methods to analyze resequencing data from four common minke whales to reveal important insights into their evolutionary history without the need for a reference sequence. we identified genes common to cetaceans with accelerated rates of evolution when compared with other mammals, which are likely to control cetacean specific traits.

RESULTS
genome assembly, gene prediction and variant detection
dna from four common minke whales from the northeast pacific were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> whole genome shotgun sequencing protocol. the contig information of each common minke whale sample was generated from error corrected reads using the allpath-lg algorithm  <cit>  and is described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  one sample  showed better assembly statistics in comparison to the other three samples. considering the contigs longer than  <dig>  bp, the genome assembly of the s <dig> sample had  <dig>  contigs  with  <dig>  n bases. this covered approximately 67% of the estimated common minke whale genome of  <dig> gbp. the various repeat elements of the genome  identified by repeatmasker are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  gene prediction results from masked genome sequences of each sample are described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  using the gene predictions based on augustus  <cit>  and blastp  <cit>  searches, we were able to classify contigs from each sample into four categories . after merging, extension and a bridging process based on the s <dig> genome assembly and the three other samples, we created a consenus genome assembly of the common minke whale. the combined genome assembly had the same maximum length as the s <dig> genome assembly but the n <dig> length and average length were slightly increased to  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. in addition, the genome coverage was increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with  <dig>  genes from blastp. summary statistics of the combined common minke whale genome assembly are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> and the repeat elements are described in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the results of short read mapping obtained using bowtie <dig>  <cit>  are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  unified genotyper detected  <dig>  small indel variants and  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide variants . after filtering the variants,  <dig>  indels and  <dig> , <dig> snvs remained . the number of variants in each sample is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

comparison to the previous genome assembly analysis
the assembly metrics showed the smaller number of contigs , shorter genome length , more genes predicted , but similar proportion of repeat elements and raw reads realignment rate  compared to the previous version of genome assembly.

we then performed re-sequencing analysis using the 1) reported draft of common minke whale genome  <cit>  and 2) our assembled scaffolds as reference to call snp genotypes of our  <dig> common minke whale samples to examine the concordance between two studies . the number of matched loci was  <dig>  and the genotype concordance was  <dig> % on average. this concordance rate may indicate that our assembly metrics are comparable to the previous study of minke whale genome with high-coverage data and various libraries.

evolutionary phylogenetic relationships of baleen whales
using four different methods , we reconstructed an evolutionary phylogenomic tree from  <dig> mitochondrial genome sequences consisting of  <dig> newly determined and  <dig> published sequences of the baleen whales . kogia breviceps  was used as an outgroup. common minke whales  diverged from a single maternal origin approximately  <dig>   mya and were closely related to antarctic minke whale . the time to the most recent common ancestor of the baleen whales was estimated to be about  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

kogia breviceps  was used as an outgroup. the data set was also phylogenetically analyzed with bi, ml, and nj methods and identical topology was produced. node bars correspond to the 95% hpd for tmrca of nodes and the numbers on the nodes represent : posterior probabilities  for bayesian inference tree, bootstrap values  for maximum likelihood tree, and bootstrap values  for neighbor joining tree. the scale bar represents time in million years before present .



genes showing accelerated evolution in the common minke whale lineage
taking into consideration the phylogenetic relationships among baleen whales, we next searched for genes that could possibly explain the specific characteristics of common minke whale. we identified  <dig>  orthologous genes from  <dig> species  to measure the rate of evolution using the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate  analysis. using a branch model with f3x <dig> codon frequencies , we found  <dig> common minke whale genes that were significantly accelerated compared with the other mammal species . to understand the functional significance of these genes, we performed an enrichment test of gene ontology  terms for biological processes. the genes were enriched in the function related to wnt receptor signaling pathways  . the wnt gene family consists of structurally related genes that encode secreted signaling proteins. these include wnt <dig>  wnt5a, wnt7a, wnt10b, and wnt <dig>  and are important in skin development and also maintaining the hair-inducing activity of the dermal papilla  <cit> . in addition, sfn is a cell cycle regulator involved in epithelial keratinization and is expressed primarily in epithelial cells  <cit> . a mutation in this gene was found to be responsible for the repeated epilation phenotype  <cit> . these accelerated genes may have played partial roles in the evolution of skin, hair loss, and baleen plates in baleen whales. another interesting gene, neuropeptide y , is a neurotransmitter in the brain and ubiquitously distributed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems  <cit> . npy is known to produce thermogenesis through brown adipose  <cit>  and thus influences thermoregulation . this gene likely reflect the physiological activities required for adaptation to underwater environment, such as cold temperature.figure  <dig>

genes under positive selection during speciation of dolphins and common minke whales
we then investigated the genes under positive selection between whales and dolphins using the mcdonald and kreitman test , which is one of the most powerful and extensively used tests for detecting signatures of natural selection at the molecular level  <cit> . among  <dig>  orthologous genes in dolphins and common minke whales, we found evidence for significant positive selection in  <dig> genes . these genes reflect a paucity of nonsynonymous polymorphism relative to nonsynonymous divergence and thus is indicative of positive selection. previously, egr <dig> was identified as one of genes differentially expressed in bowhead whales, another baleen whale species, compared to other mammals  <cit> . egr <dig> encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor and regulates cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . it is highly expressed during tooth development by cells of the enamel epithelium and the dental mesenchyme, and may be a key mediator of anabolic response in cementoblasts  <cit> . rbl <dig> is associated with developmental delay of tooth germs and hair follicles  <cit> . mutation in aga causes a heritable lysosome storage disorder and is associated with changes in the facial skin, dental arches and occlusion  <cit> . mysticeti today have baleen and lack teeth as adults, whereas odontoceti is the clade of living toothed whales  <cit> . although the roles of these genes remain incompletely understood, we speculate that this series of genes may support the transition from tooth-aided predation to filter feeding using baleen.

CONCLUSIONS
the draft common minke whale genome sequence supports further evolutionary and comparative genomics studies of the baleen whales. the common minke whale seems to benefit from positive selection on specific genes functioning in the hairless body and thermoregulation. the presence of this benefit is supported by the detection of higher measure of adaptive evolution in protein-coding sequences.

comparative genomics is a promising tool for determining the genetic basis of biological functions. sequencing more mammalian genomes will facilitate our ability to annotate the human genome more thoroughly. so far, however, only a few mammals have had their complete genomes sequenced, and clearly, more data are necessary for carrying out detailed mammalian genomics. the primary limitations are due to the extreme cost and amount of time needed to sequence and assemble very large genomes that would be suitable for such analyses  <cit> . despite relatively low sequencing depth, the assembled contigs and scaffolds of the common minke whale genome were sufficiently long to allow us to perform our gene prediction and comparative analyses. our capability to generate and assemble a draft sequence for an entire mammalian genome indicates that such technology can be used to generate many other mammalian genome draft sequences in a time- and cost-effective manner.

the common minke whale genome provides unique insight into the origin and evolution of the baleen whale lineage, especially with continued refinements in the assembly and extensive functional analysis.
