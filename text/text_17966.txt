BACKGROUND
fungal infections are the fourth most common nosocomial bloodstream infection in the united states. candida species account for approximately 10% of all bloodstream infections  <cit>  and worldwide are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection  <cit> . due to their increasing clinical importance, recent sequencing projects have determined the complete sequence of ten candida genomes, including common pathogenic species and species rarely, if ever, associated with disease  <cit> .

the term candida was originally assigned to imperfect yeast species, with no known sexual cycle. this term now covers a variety of species of diverse origins , and provides little information regarding evolutionary relationships. for example, candida glabrata is more closely related to saccharomyces cerevisiae than it is to candida albicans. debaryomyces hansenii and pichia stipitis are close relatives of candida species  <cit> . some species, such as c. lusitaniae, were assigned two names, one  referring to the asexual  form, and one  to the sexual  form. similarly, candida guilliermondii is also known as pichia guilliermondii, and candida famata as d. hansenii. these species share a relatively recent common ancestor , and in all cases the codon cug is translated as serine rather than leucine  <cit> . for brevity, we refer to the above as candida species that belong to the ctg clade  <cit> .

previous comparative analysis of eight candida genomes led to the identification of gene families that are highly represented in strongly pathogenic species , compared to weak pathogens such as c. lusitaniae and c. guilliermondii, and very rare or non-pathogenic species such as d. hansenii  <cit> . these include three cell wall families; the als-like adhesins, which in c. albicans have been associated with virulence, biofilm development and acquisition of iron from the host  <cit> ; the pga30-like family  <cit> , and the hyr/iff family  <cit> . many families are highly enriched for gene duplications  <cit> .

there are currently two major browsers that display candida genomes, candidadb, which contains information for several candida genomes, and the candida genome database, which predominantly describes c. albicans  <cit> . the major disadvantage of these browsers is that it is difficult to compare genomes to each other. they also display a to-scale representation of a chromosomal region, which is unsuitable for analysis of gene order and evolution. to overcome these problems we developed the candida gene order browser .

cgob incorporates all available genome sequences from candida species, including two isolates of c. albicans , its close relative and minor pathogen c. dubliniensis, the major pathogens c. tropicalis and c. parapsilosis, the minor pathogens l. elongisporus, c. lusitaniae and c. guilliermondii, the marine yeast d. hansenii, and p. stipitis, a xylose-digesting yeast that is associated with beetles found in wood  <cit> . cgob is based on the engine developed for the yeast gene order browser   <cit> , which has been applied to the analysis of genome duplication in the saccharomyces group. to construct cgob, all assignments of homology were manually curated, based on sequence similarity and gene order . partial genes in each genome were identified and removed, leading to the generation of improved gene sets. cgob was then used to analyze gene duplication, intron localization and clustering of genes involved in metabolic pathways. we found that the majority of tandemly duplicated genes are under strong purifying selection and that there are both conserved and species-specific clusters of metabolically related genes in candida. cgob is available at http://cgob.ucd.ie.

RESULTS
cgob structure and candida genome editing
version  <dig> of cgob includes ten candida genomes obtained from a variety of sequencing centers , together with the genome from s. cerevisiae. cgob's visual display consists of horizontal tracks representing chromosomal segments and pillars . pillars are the core data structures used to store list of homologies across all species represented in the gene order browser  <cit> . pillars contain vacant slots when homologous genes cannot be found in a particular genome. genes were initially added to pillars based on automated assignments derived from best bidirectional blastp searches. the cgob pillar dataset was manually refined by examining regions of dubious synteny and singleton genes. a combination of blastp scores, synteny and phylogenetic data were used to confirm assignments to pillars.

similar to ygob, cgob allows the user to focus the screen display on a gene of interest and to view phylogenetic trees, sequences and blastp results . hyperlinks to functional data can also be accessed for c. albicans sc <dig> and s. cerevisiae via the candida genome database  <cit>  and the saccharomyces genome database  <cit>  respectively.

during manual editing of cgob we observed that the original genome annotations contained a substantial number of apparently partial open reading frames, which we merged into full-length gene models. for example, lelg_ <dig> and lelg_ <dig> in l. elongisporus are both similar to parts of c. albicans orf <dig>  . closer inspection showed that lelg_ <dig> aligned with the n-terminus of orf <dig>  whereas lelg_ <dig> matches the c-terminus . in cases like this we deleted the partial open reading frames from cgob's homology pillars and inserted a new "merged" gene model. overall, we identified  <dig> orfs in  <dig> genomes that were subsequently merged into  <dig> full-length genes . the l. elongisporus genome contained the highest number of partial orfs , while the highly curated genomes of c. albicans sc <dig> and c. dubliniensis contain none . the corrected gene sets are available for download from cgob  <cit> .

tandem gene duplications
tandem gene duplication is one mechanism by which species acquire new genes, and by extrapolation, new functions. we therefore used both similarity and synteny measurements in cgob to identify gene duplications in all candida genomes. we identified and numbered all tandem clusters in each genome . for some rapidly evolving genes, sequence similarity is not high enough to identify family members. for example, our initial blast based approach suggested that orf <dig>   and orf <dig>  in c. albicans are tandem duplicates . their orthologs in c. dubliniensis, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and l. elongisporus are found adjacent to one another. however, these genes were not initially identified as tandem duplicates in the other species because they do not have a blastp e-value below our initial cut-off . therefore, slower evolving tandem duplicates in one candida species  can be used to locate rapidly evolving tandems  in other candida genomes.

tandem duplicates that subsequently underwent chromosomal rearrangement are difficult to identify. however, the ancestral arrangement can be inferred from an analysis of homologous genes in cgob. for example, in c. albicans sc <dig>  the duplicate genes orf <dig>   and orf <dig>   are located beside one another on chromosome  <dig> ). their orthologs in c. albicans wo- <dig>  c. dubliniensis, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis, l. elongisporus and d. hansenii are also adjacent . however in p. stipitis, skn <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig> while kre <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig> . the most parsimonious explanation is that a duplication of skn <dig> or kre <dig> occurred in an ancestor of all the candida species, and this has been conserved in most. however, relocation of skn <dig> has occurred exclusively in p. stipitis .

in total  <dig> tandem clusters were identified across all the candida genomes . c. lusitaniae has the smallest number of tandem clusters  whereas c. parapsilosis has the highest number . this is noticeably high, as the closest relative of c. parapsilosis, l. elongisporus , contains only  <dig> tandem clusters . the average number of genes per tandem cluster in all candida species ranges is slightly greater than  <dig> .

species
percentages in parenthesis refer to the total percentage of the genome that has arisen through tandem duplication.

we used cgob to map species and lineage-specific tandem duplications . for example, since they last shared a common ancestor, c. albicans has undergone at least  <dig> species-specific tandem duplications gaining  <dig> paralogs, while its close relative c. dubliniensis has undergone a single tandem duplication  gaining  <dig> additional gene . similarly, c. parapsilosis has undergone  <dig> species-specific tandem duplications gaining  <dig> paralogs since diverging from its closest relative, l. elongisporus, which has undergone  <dig> tandem duplication gaining  <dig> paralogs in the same time .

cluster  <dig>  illustrates an ancient duplication, resulting in a family of peroxisomal acyl-coa thioesterases that are present in 3- <dig> tandem copies in all the candida species. the cluster is particularly large in the branch containing c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and l. elongisporus, where  <dig> family members are immediately adjacent to each other. the single homolog in s. cerevisiae is likely to be involved in fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . there is significant up-regulation of fatty acid β-oxidation when c. albicans cells are engulfed by macrophages  <cit> , although this pathway does not appear to be essential for virulence  <cit> . many of the other tandem duplication clusters include members of larger gene families, such as lipases , glucose transporters  and ferric reductases . some clusters are lineage specific, such as the triplication of the pirin-domain genes prn <dig>  prn <dig> and prn <dig>  in c. albicans, c. dubliniensis and c. tropicalis. the function of these genes in unknown, but they are likely to localize to the nucleus. there is an amplification of the frp <dig> family in d. hansenii and p. stipitis; the s. cerevisiae orthologs are required for export of ammonia  <cit>  . other clusters are species-specific, such as the five adjacent 2' hydroxyisoflavone reductases  described by jeffries and van vleet  <cit> , which our analysis confirms is unique to p. stipitis . most of the other species have a single copy, except for c. parapsilosis, which has two. l. elongisporus contains  <dig> tandem repeats of a large family with up to  <dig> members in this species, which is absent from all the other candida genomes . the function of this family is unclear but all members contain a phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase  domain.

we also determined whether tandem duplicates in individual candida species are undergoing positive selection. recent genome wide studies have shown that positive selection after tandem duplication can give rise to novel gene functions  <cit> , that may help pathogens evade the human immune response  <cit> . at the dna level, positive selection may be detected by comparing the rate of amino acid altering  nucleotide substitutions with the rate of synonymous substitution . a dn/ds ratio >  <dig> is indicative of positive selection. the average dn/ds ratio for all tandem clusters was found to be  <dig>  . of the  <dig> candida clusters examined, only  <dig> displayed a dn/ds ratio >  <dig> . five of these are species-specific and have no homologs in any other candida species . the remaining  <dig> clusters under the influence of positive selection do not share homology with gene families  normally associated with pathogenicity in candida  <cit> . in p. stipitis, one cluster encodes putative ubiquitin protein ligases, one encodes zinc finger-containing proteins, and one encodes potential siderophore transporters . in d. hansenii, one cluster encodes orthologs of tfs <dig>  whose expression is induced during filamentation in c. albicans  <cit> . overall our results suggest that the majority of candida tandem duplicates are under the influence of strong purifying selection, presumably to conserve gene function.

we have extended an earlier analysis of duplicate genes in candida genomes, which considered only members of multigene families  <cit> . we also identified some clusters by manual inspection. for example, we first identified  <dig> tandem clusters in c. albicans sc <dig> using a simple blast approach, and this was increased to  <dig> using synteny information, whereas only  <dig> were reported in butler et al  <cit> . in some species  we identified a smaller number of clusters than butler et al  <cit> , partly because we removed partial orfs from the gene sets.

the candida paranome
using our reannotated candida genomes we determined the number of multigene families  for each candida species. c. tropicalis has the highest number , whereas c. lusitaniae  has the lowest . in contrast, c. parapsilosis has the lowest number  of genes that do not belong to families, whereas c. lusitaniae  has the highest . the average number of genes per multigene family is approximately  <dig> for all species, although all candida species have larger gene families .

the number of single- and multi- gene families in each candida species displayed in cgob.

the largest gene family shared by all species contains a transporter  annotated as a putative dicarboxylic amino acid permease in cgd. this family was previously suggested as a potential antifungal target, as there are no homologs in humans  <cit> . all candida species have at least  <dig> members of this family . the mep family, encoding three ammonium permeases in c. albicans sc <dig>  has also suggested as an antifungal drug target  <cit> . three mep genes are present in all candida species except for l. elongisporus, which is missing the ortholog of one . drugs directed against these families should therefore be of broad specificity and target all candida species, and are likely to have no undesired interactions with the human patient.

approximately 20-25% of all candida genes in cgob belong to a multigene family , similar to what has previously been reported for c. albicans sc <dig>  <cit> . this figure is lower than what has been observed for s. cerevisiae , which is unsurprising as s. cerevisiae has undergone a whole genome duplication  <cit>  while candida species have not  <cit> .

intron loss in candida genes
yeast genomes from the saccharomycotina are known to be intron poor; introns are found in fewer than 5% of genes from most species  <cit> . the exact mechanisms of intron loss are not fully elucidated, but it is likely to occur via recombination of a chromosomal copy with a reverse transcript  <cit> . introns have been predicted with some accuracy in only three of the sequenced candida genomes - c. albicans, c. dubliniensis and d. hansenii. we therefore restricted our analysis to these species. where we observed differences in intron locations in tandem duplicates in any one species, the corresponding genomic sequence of the other two was manually inspected to confirm intron presence or absence.

c. albicans sc <dig> has at least  <dig> genes containing  <dig> introns  <cit> . of these genes,  <dig>  belong to a multigene family, and five are located in tandem clusters.

cluster  <dig> contains three paralogs in c. albicans , and orf <dig> ) . the first two of these genes contain introns, as do their orthologs in c. dubliniensis. there is a single homolog in d. hansenii, which has undergone an inversion relative to c. albicans, but still contains an intron. however, the third gene  does not contain an intron in any of the species . the most likely hypotheses are that either the progenitor copy contained an intron and was duplicated twice, followed by intron loss in one copy, or that the progenitor was first duplicated to generate a second intron-containing copy, and then duplicated again in an rna-mediated event.

cluster  <dig>  contains members of a family of glutathione-s-transferases that are present in two adjacent copies in some species and three in others . two genes in c. albicans, c. dubliniensis and d. hansenii have introns, suggesting that they arose through tandem duplication . however, a third member of the family  which lies within the cluster in c. parapsilosis, l. elongisporus and c. guilliermondii does not contain any introns in c. albicans or c. dubliniensis . gtt <dig> may therefore have arisen via an rna intermediate in an ancestral candida species.

we also found evidence for a species-specific intron gain in a tandem duplicate. cluster  <dig>  contains two adjacent genes  in c. albicans, c. dubliniensis and p. stipitis that belong to a large family of sugar transporters that have at least  <dig> members in candida species  <cit>  . the hgt <dig> homolog is not adjacent to hgt <dig> in the other species . in c. albicans, hgt <dig> contains an intron, whereas its paralog hgt <dig> does not. the hgt <dig> intron lies within the coding sequence, which makes it easy to identify . interestingly, although this intron is present in hgt <dig> from both c. albicans isolates, it is absent from all of the homologs in the other species, whether syntenic or not . intron gain is very rare  <cit> , but it appears more likely that hgt <dig> in c. albicans gained an intron, rather than the intron was independently lost from all the other species. at least one other member of the hgt family  also contains introns in c. albicans, but these appear to be conserved in c. dubliniensis only.

other gene families that are not tandemly arranged are also likely to have arisen through both dna-based gene duplication and via an rna intermediate, possibly including retrotransposition. for example in c. albicans, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell wall gene ecm <dig>  <cit>  has two paralogs orf <dig>  and orf <dig>   that are not adjacent to each other . ecm <dig> and orf <dig>  both contain an intron, as do their orthologs in c. dubliniensis and d. hansenii. ecm <dig> does not contain an intron in any of the three species. this suggests that ecm <dig> and orf <dig>  may have arisen through duplication, and ecm <dig> is the result of reverse transcription of one of the intron-containing paralogs, in an ancestor of the three species.

clustering of adjacent genes in metabolic pathways
in bacteria the primary method of controlling gene expression is the organization of genes into operons, which are transcribed into a single mrna. bacterial operons often contain genes from the same metabolic pathway. operons are not usually found in eukaryotes, with the notable exception of nematodes  <cit> . however, there is evidence for clustering of genes at the same genomic location belonging to the same metabolic pathways in fungi. for example, genes involved in secondary metabolism are clustered in the genomes of filamentous ascomycetes  <cit> , and many of the genes involved in metabolism of allantoin and galactose are clustered in the genome of s. cerevisiae and related species  <cit> . many functionally-related genes are co-expressed, even when they do not share sequence similarity  <cit> . lee and sonnhammer  <cit>  found that there is significant tendency for genes from the same metabolic pathway to cluster in the genomes of fungi, and in other organisms. however, their definition of proximity was very large, and included genes that were separated by up to  <dig> other genes. our analysis had a more focused approach, as we searched for evidence of genes involved in the same metabolic pathway lying up to  <dig> genes apart in candida species.

currently there are  <dig> metabolic pathways that have been manually curated by the candida genome database. however,  <dig> of these contain only one gene, and a further  <dig> are redundant. for example, the list of genes involved in the acrylonitrile and aldoxime degradation pathways are identical. similarly the tyrosol, tryptophan, phenylalanine and chorismate biosynthesis are all subsets of the superpathway of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. there are  <dig> unique pathways, containing  <dig> genes. there are  <dig> unique genes in total, representing  <dig> % of the c. albicans sc <dig> gene set.

cgob was interrogated for evidence of clustering of genes  in the  <dig> nonredundant pathways. we identified  <dig> pathways that display evidence of gene clustering in at least one candida species . some metabolic pathway clusters result from tandem duplication; for example, aox <dig> and aox <dig>  in c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. tropicalis and c. parapsilosis, were also identified as tandem cluster  <dig> . there is evidence of species-specific clusters of unrelated genes, such as lysine biosynthesis and glycine biosynthesis, which are clustered in one species only .

superscript numerals in parenthesis refer to the numbers of genes that are either paralogs d or tandem duplicates t.

a high proportion  of the clusters identified contain only two genes and may not be biologically significant, as they appear at a high frequency in randomized data . however, the metabolic clusters discussed here are highly significant, particularly for the three pathways discussed below.

 the biotin biosynthesis pathway
biotin or vitamin h acts as a cofactor for a set of enzymes that catalyze carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions in a number of crucial metabolic processes  <cit> . most multicellular eukaryotes  are biotin auxotrophs, whereas many bacterial species and some fungi  are biotin prototrophs  <cit> .

in s. cerevisiae  <dig> genes are involved in the production of biotin . these are located in  <dig> clusters   <cit> . hall and dietrich  <cit>  showed that the original eukaryotic biotin pathway was lost in the last common ancestor of candida and saccharomyces species, but it has been rebuilt through horizontal gene transfer from bacterial species via transfers of bio <dig> from δ-proteobacteria and bio <dig> from α-proteobacteria, followed by gene duplication and neofunctionalization.

we identified a biotin cluster of four genes  in both c. albicans strains . there is however an inversion of the surrounding region between sc <dig> and wo- <dig> ; this appears to result from a rearrangement between two members of the oligopeptide transporter gene family, opt <dig>  and opt <dig> 

the cluster in c. albicans is larger than the equivalent region in s. cerevisiae as it includes bio <dig>  bio <dig> orthologs are in the same chromosomal region in c. albicans, d. hansenii, c. lusitaniae and c. guilliermondii . bio <dig>  bio <dig> and bio <dig> are also adjacent to each other in c. tropicalis, and they appear to have been recruited to the bio <dig> region in c. albicans. almost the entire cluster, together with an adjacent opt gene, is missing from c. dubliniensis. only bio <dig> remains, and this is located elsewhere in the genome. the absence of the biotin cluster in c. dubliniensis has previously been reported, and it was suggested that its presence in c. albicans may contribute to increased prevalence and virulence  <cit> . the entire set of bio genes is also absent from c. parapsilosis and l. elongisporus, and was probably lost in their last common ancestor . there is some conservation of synteny of the surrounding genes , suggesting the genes were lost together, as a cluster. unlike s. cerevisiae, the biotin clusters in c. albicans and c. tropicalis are not sub-telomeric.

the remaining candida species contain some genes involved in biotin synthesis. bio <dig> is present in almost all species, suggesting it may play a role independent of biotin synthesis. bio <dig> and bio <dig> are clustered in d. hansenii with bio <dig> elsewhere in the genome, whereas bio <dig>  bio <dig> and bio <dig> are present in p. stipitis, but are not clustered . it is not clear why some components of the pathway are retained in some species. however, it may enable them to make biotin from some intermediates, as was described for s. cerevisiae  <cit> . it is generally assumed however that clustering of genes in biosynthetic pathways is the result of selection against toxic intermediates produced by incomplete pathways  <cit> . it is likely that the ancestral candida species was able to synthesize biotin, but there has been substantial gene loss in many species.

in s. cerevisiae bio <dig> is believed to have arisen through gene duplication of bio <dig> followed by subfunctionalization  <cit> . we cannot locate an ortholog of bio <dig> in any candida species. similarly we cannot locate any candida ortholog of bio <dig> , the first enzyme involved in synthesizing biotin from pimelic acid. in s. cerevisiae s288c, bio <dig> and bio <dig> are pseudogenes  <cit> , but there is no evidence of corresponding pseudogenes in any candida species. it is therefore unlikely that the genes are present in other unsequenced isolates of the same species.

the cgd biotin pathway data suggests that orf <dig>   is involved in biotin synthesis. bio <dig> has a top blastp hit to bio <dig> in s. cerevisiae. however, bio <dig> belongs to a multigene family that also contains arg <dig>  car <dig> and uga <dig>  to determine the origin of bio <dig> we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree using the same sequences used by hall and dietrich  <cit> , and included arg <dig>  car <dig> and uga <dig> from c. albicans and s. cerevisiae. our phylogeny places the s. cerevisiae and c. albicans bio <dig> orthologs together with bacterial sequences, indicating that they originated from horizontal gene transfer as suggested by hall and dietrich  <cit> . s. cerevisiae bio <dig> is also grouped in this clade, supporting the hypothesis that it is a duplicate of bio <dig>  however, bio <dig> from c. albicans is grouped with s. cerevisiae and c. albicans orthologs of arg <dig>  car <dig> and uga <dig> in a separate clade . bio <dig> is therefore most likely a duplicate of one of these genes, and is more likely to be involved in arginine or glutamate metabolism than in biotin synthesis.

 the n-acetylglucosamine regulon
it has been proposed that the ability of pathogenic strains of candida to utilize sugars such as glucosamine and n-acetylglucosamine  as alternative carbon sources are important virulence factors  <cit> . c. albicans mutants incapable of utilizing nag are less virulent in a murine model of systemic candidiasis compared to wild type isolates  <cit> . the three genes involved in the conversion of nag to fructose-6-phosphate encode hexokinase kinase , nag-6-phosphate deaminase  and nag-6-phosphate deacetylase . these act sequentially on nag and are present in c. albicans in a cluster termed the nag regulon  <cit> .

our clustering analysis shows that the nag regulon is conserved in all candida species, with the exception of c. lusitaniae . in the latter species, there has been an insertion of  <dig> species-specific genes in the region between hxk <dig> and nag <dig>  resulting in a sequence of  <dig>  basepairs , whereas the intergenic region in the other species is less than  <dig> bp. several of the inserted genes encode members of a family of cell wall genes, related to flo <dig> from s. cerevisiae. the nag cluster is sub-telomeric in many of the candida species, and repeats of cell wall genes are commonly found near telomeres  <cit> . the conservation of the nag regulon in pathogens like c. albicans and nonpathogens such as p. stipitis suggests that the ability to utilize nag is not a virulence factor. nag <dig>  nag <dig> and nag <dig>  which lie close to the nag cluster in many candida species , are not involved in the conversion of nag, but are more likely to encode drug efflux pumps  <cit> . nag <dig> is a tandem duplicate of nag <dig> , which occurred in the ancestor of c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and l. elongisporus .

the phylogenomic distribution of the nag regulon is intriguing. the cluster is found in the candida species, but nag <dig> and dac <dig> are missing in the saccharomyces lineage. homologs are also absent from ashbya gossypii and kluyveromyces waltii, suggesting the cluster is missing from the entire saccharomycetes lineage. however, the origin of the nag cluster may be an ancient event. dac <dig> and nag <dig> are in close proximity  in the aspergilli and in neurospora crassa, which belong to the pezizomycotina, a sister clade to the saccharomycotina. dac <dig> and nag <dig> also lie within  <dig> genes in the basidiomycete, ustilago maydis. if the cluster arose in an ancestor of the ascomycota and the basidiomycota, it is very ancient, and the genes have been subsequently lost from many species .

 the leloir galactose utilization pathway
galactose is utilized by most organisms through its conversion to glucose-6-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis  <cit> . the gal pathway is composed of both structural and regulator elements  <cit> . the galactose metabolism structural genes of s. cerevisiae and c. albicans are well conserved, whereas their regulatory components are distinct  <cit> . in c. albicans the structural genes  are arranged in a cluster close to a hexose transporter hgt <dig>  <cit> . this cluster, together with two additional uncharacterized genes which lie between gal <dig> and gal <dig>  is conserved in c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. parapsilosis and d. hansenii  <cit> . we show that the gal pathway cluster is conserved in all candida species present in cgob .

both c. albicans strains and c. lusitaniae have a gene insertion between gal <dig> and gal <dig> . the c. albicans gene  is designated "dubious " by cgd, and is a pseudogene in wo- <dig>  with no significant similarity to any other gene known from any other organism. similarly the c. lusitaniae gene  has no significant homologs in either genbank or cgob blast databases. the intergenic regions between gal <dig> and gal <dig> are  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in c. lusitaniae and c. albicans, similar to the intergenic regions in all the other candida species. it is likely therefore that both orf <dig>  and clug_ <dig> are errors in annotation, rather than real genes and so are not shown in figure  <dig> 

expression of the hexose transporter hgt <dig> is strongly induced by galactose in c. albicans  <cit> . an ortholog of hgt <dig> is also very close to gal <dig> in c. dubliniensis, c. tropicalis, c. guilliermondii and c. lusitaniae . hgt <dig> belongs to a large gene family, and while multiple homologs were located in many species, there is no family member adjacent to the gal cluster in c. parapsilosis, l. elongisporus and p. stipitis. a putative ortholog in d. hansenii was identified, although it resides on a different chromosome to the gal genes . it is possible that even though the relative position of the hexose transporter is not conserved, co-expression with the gal genes may be.

interestingly, orf <dig> , which lies between gal <dig> and gal <dig>  appears to be a paralog of gal <dig>  and is conserved in all the candida species. this was also noted in the p. stipitis genome  <cit> . gal <dig> is more than twice the size of orf <dig>  , and contains two recognized protein domains, an nad dependent epimerase/dehydratase domain and an aldose 1-epimerase domain. only the first domain is present in orf <dig>  and its orthologs. expression of this gene is not influenced by galactose in c. albicans  <cit> . orf <dig>  may therefore have undergone subfunctionalization after duplication. alternatively, recombination between a gal <dig> precursor and another gene may have led to gene with a novel function. an ortholog of the adjacent conserved gene  encodes a subunit of the transport protein particle  of the cis-golgi in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and is unlikely to be involved in galactose metabolism.

kegg analysis
we also assigned genes in each candida species to individual metabolic pathways using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . this approach permitted us to investigate species-specific metabolic pathways, as well as pathways that have been described only in c. albicans sc <dig>  approximately  <dig> metabolic pathways were reconstructed for each candida species . however, ~30% of these were redundant . for example, in c. dubliniensis, the inferred components of the pathways for peptidoglycan and alkaloid biosynthesis are completely contained in the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway . the number of gene assignments to the non-redundant pathways is approximately  <dig> for each candida species. on average close to 50% of these are represented in multiple pathways . therefore between 16-19% of genes from each candida species have been successfully assigned to a unique kegg metabolic pathway , equating to  <dig> % of all candida genes represented in cgob.

species
we interrogated each candida species in cgob for evidence of clustering in the non-redundant kegg pathways . in total we identified  <dig> pathways;  that display some evidence of gene clustering . there are  <dig> kegg clusters  shared amongst all species, and of these  <dig> have arisen through tandem duplication . most of the identified kcs are small, containing two or three genes. a high proportion  of these may not be biologically significant , as they appear at a high frequency in randomized data .

overall the observed kegg metabolic pathway clusters are generally distinct from those located using the cgd pathways . there is a small degree of crossover, including the cgd trna charging pathway, which is analogous to kegg's aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis pathway, the cgd aerobic respiration pathway which is equivalent to oxidative phosphorylation in kegg, and the galactose metabolism and histidine metabolism pathways in both. several pathways  and ribosomal protein genes  have been described previously. it is likely that other clusters will be identified when the assignments to pathways improve. for example, jeffries and van vleet  <cit>  identified some small clusters of functionally-related genes in p. stipitis by visual inspection. our approach found some of these, but not all.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe here a unique tool for studying evolution and gene function in candida species. during the development of cgob we improved the existing annotations for several species, by identifying and removing partial open reading frames, and by manually assigning homology, based on sequence similarity and synteny. we also provide a detailed analysis of gene clusters in candida, which will provide a basis for future investigation. we identified many of the clusters described in only one species  <cit> . however, we have also shown the benefits of a comparative approach; some clusters  although originally described in c. albicans only are present in all candida species, whereas others  are unique to one . our analysis provides an important resource that is now available for the candida community.
