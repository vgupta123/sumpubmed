BACKGROUND
at the transcriptional level, bacterial gene expression under rapidly changing environmental conditions is controlled by changes in associations between different alternative σ factors and the catalytic core of rna polymerase. alternative σ factors are important contributors to gene expression under stress conditions in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in the foodborne pathogen listeria monocytogenes, four alternative sigma factors  play a role in transcriptional regulation. σb and the σb regulon have been well defined in this pathogen through a variety of different approaches . a number of different studies have indicated that σb controls a large regulon that plays important roles in both stress response and virulence. the regulons controlled by the other alternative σ factors in l. monocytogenes have been less well defined.

while σh specifically has been shown to play an important role in regulating spore formation and competence in b. subtilis  <cit> , the function of σh in listeria has not yet been well defined. in b. subtilis, σh has been reported to regulate > <dig> genes   <cit> . b. subtilis σh is also involved in the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase, nutrient transport, and the regulation of many other transcription factors and cell-wall-binding proteins  <cit> . in l. monocytogenes characterization of a sigh null mutant suggested a role for σh in growth on minimal medium and under alkaline conditions as well as a role in virulence, as assessed in an intraperitoneal inoculated mouse model  <cit> . while previous microarray experiments identified  <dig> genes as being directly upregulated by σh, these experiments also found that the largest category of co-regulated genes were represented by genes that showed transcript levels affected by both the σb and σh deletions  <cit> . based on this considerable overlap between the σb and σh regulon, we surmised that different approaches are needed to further define σh-dependent genes in l. monocytogenes. in order to eliminate redundancies between transcriptional regulation by σh and other alternative σ factors, we chose to perform rna-seq based comparisons of transcript levels between a l. monocytogenes mutant with deletions of all  <dig> genes encoding alternative σ factors , and one with the same background that was modified to overexpress sigh . we also implemented an advanced bio-informatics approach where we compare normalized rna-seq coverage , between these two strains using a sliding window of 51 nt and 25 nt overlap along the whole genome, rather than comparing nrc calculated only for whole genes; a similar approach was detailed independently in a recent study  <cit> . we surmised that this approach would allow for more sensitive identification of differentially regulated genes and gene fragments, particularly for genes that may be preceded by multiple promoters , where differential transcript levels may only be detectable downstream of the σh-dependent promoter, but not in the actual open reading frame  where transcription from the σa-dependent promoter may obscure the differential transcription from the σh-dependent promoter.

RESULTS
a sliding window method for identification of differentially regulated genes and promoters provides a sensitive approach for identification of σh dependent genes
traditionally, analysis of rna-seq data is performed by calculating the normalized rna-seq coverage  for a given annotated gene and comparing nrcs between strains with different genetic backgrounds or strains grown under different conditions. when this approach was used here, we initially identified  <dig> genes that showed significantly higher transcript levels  in the l. monocytogenes strain overexpressing sigh , as compared to the control strain Δbchl::prha, which does not contain sigh. these  <dig> genes represented lmrg_ <dig>  lmrg_ <dig> , lmrg_ <dig> , lmrg_ <dig> , and lmrg_ <dig>  . a total of four σh-dependent promoters were identified upstream of these five genes as comea and comec share the same promoter. considering these promoters and previously reported operon structures in l. monocytogenes  <cit> , these  <dig> σh-dependent genes were found to represent  <dig> multigene operons, including  lmrg_ <dig>  lmrg_ <dig>  and lmrg_ <dig> ; and  lmrg_ <dig> , lmrg_ <dig>  and lmrg_ <dig> ) and  <dig> monocistronic genes, coia and lytg, for a total of  <dig> genes that are positively regulated by σh . we did not find any genes that were significantly downregulated by σh .fig.  <dig> schematic of σh-dependent transcriptional units identified here. a lmrg_00908-dnag-rpod operon; b

subsequent sliding window analysis, using the same rna-seq data analyzed with the standard bayseq approach , identified two additional σh-dependent promoters, in addition to also identifying the promoters described above. the two newly identified promoters, along with previously reported operon structures in l. monocytogenes  <cit> , identified two additional multigene operons, including  lmrg_ <dig> to lmrg_ <dig> and  lmrg_ <dig> to lmrg_01005) as σh-dependent . overall, the new σh-dependent operons identified using the sliding window approach represent a total of  <dig> genes that are positively regulated by σh . the lmrg_01010-lmrg_ <dig> operon, which was identified only with the sliding window approach, showed both a σh- and two σa-dependent promoters . these data indicate that the sliding window rna-seq analysis approach described here provides a superior sensitivity for identification of differentially transcribed genes, particularly when multiple promoters are found upstream a gene or operon.table  <dig> results of sliding window approach for identification of differentially expressed fragments regulated by σh

newly identified σh-dependent genes include three σh-dependent operons that encode competence proteins
a comparison of the σh-dependent genes identified here with σh-dependent genes and operons that were previously found with microarray based characterization of a l. monocytogenes Δsigh strain  <cit>  showed that we identified a number of σh-dependent genes and operons that had not been previously identified, including lmrg <dig> , lmrg_ <dig> , lmrg_ <dig> , lmrg <dig>  . the previous microarray study used for comparison used a Δsigh strain in a wildtype background and used a standard probe based microarray ; no additional transcriptomic studies characterizing the σh regulon in listeria were available for comparison. interestingly, among the  <dig> genes identified as directly regulated by σh in the previous microarray based study of a Δsigh strain  <cit> , only  <dig> showed a fc > <dig>  . only one of these previously identified genes  was also found to be σh-dependent here. this may suggest that a number of genes recognized as σh-dependent in this previous study only show differential σh-dependent transcription in the presence of the other three alternative σ factors, which were not present in the l. monocytogenes Δbchl strain that was used here. these observations further highlight the importance of the use of alternative approaches  we have taken here to allow for identification of additional σh-dependent genes. ectopic and artificial induction of sigma factors and other regulatory proteins has been used successfully in the past to study those regulators where physiological induction signals have not been found  <cit>  and/or where mutants cannot be made  <cit> . in some cases, large periods of time have passed since linking a set of genes to a regulator  and discovering a physiological condition where a given regulator and regulated genes are induced. for example in s. aureus, σh dependent transcription of competence genes after overexpression was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> , while functional confirmation of σh contributions to competence were only reported almost 10 years later  <cit> . while our data reported here thus provide important evidence for contributions of σh to regulation of competence genes in l. monocytogenes, future experiments will be needed to probe the phenotypic importance of this regulatory pathway and to define under which conditions competence gene expression is upregulated by σh in wildtype l. monocytogenes.

importantly, we identified three σh-dependent transcription units that encode competence proteins, including  comgabcdefg,  comeabc and  coia . in b. subtilis, a naturally competent bacterium, comg proteins are required for exogenous dna to reach the membrane bound receptor comea during transformation  <cit> . among the genes in the comeabc operon, only comea and comec  have been shown to be required for transformation in b. subtilis  <cit> . b. subtilis coia has also been shown to be involved in the establishment of dna transport  <cit> . even though competence traditionally implies uptake of dna, competence genes have been shown to also play roles in survival  <cit>  and virulence  <cit> , processes which do not necessarily require dna uptake .

in l. monocytogenes, competence is not well understood. while this organism seems to possess the machinery for competence, the gene encoding a key regulator of competence in b. subtilis, comk, is often interrupted by prophages in l. monocytogenes strains  <cit> . excision of this prophage and restoration of an intact comk has been shown to be involved in phagosomal escape and virulence  <cit>  but competence was not tested in this study. the one published study that experimentally tested for competence in l. monocytogenes did not find evidence for competence even among two l. monocytogenes strains that carried an intact comk  <cit> .

interestingly, s. aureus σh has also been shown to regulate competence-related genes  <cit> . although s. aureus was originally thought to not be competent, it has now been reported that, facilitated by a complex regulatory mechanism, s. aureus cells are able to uptake exogenous dna, such as antibiotic resistance determinants, through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . even though the specific conditions for competence in l. monocytogenes have not been found yet, the fact that this pathogen has conserved σh-dependent mechanisms of regulation of competence genes suggests a specific physiological role of these genes in l. monocytogenes.

among other genes identified as being directly regulated by σh are the housekeeping genes, rpod, encoding σa and dnag, encoding the dna primase . another σh-dependent gene, lytg, encodes an enzyme with a mannosyl-glycoprotein endo-beta-n-acetylglucosamidase-like domain, which is found in enzymes such as lysozymes and the flagellar protein j that can hydrolyze peptidoglycan  <cit> . two genes involved in oxidative stress, msra and msrb were also found to be directly regulated by σh, suggesting a possible role of σh in oxidative stress response  <cit> . moreover, the σh-dependent promoter upstream this operon has a long 5’ utr , which overlaps with the 5’ utr of another gene, lmrg_ <dig>  encoded in the opposite strand. lmrg_ <dig> encodes a hemolysin iii protein  and the expression of this protein, could therefore, be σh regulated post-transcriptionally through rna interference caused by the 5’ utr from plmrg_ <dig> 

σh - dependent promoters are highly conserved among different l. monocytogenes genomes
the six σh-dependent promoters identified in l. monocytogenes 10403s were all found to be present in the  <dig> additional l. monocytogenes genomes analyzed here . in general, − <dig> and − <dig> promoter regions were highly conserved . for both the comga and the lytg promoter sequence, the − <dig> region was completely conserved across all  <dig> genomes, while the − <dig> region presented two variants for each of these two promoters. the comea promoter showed a completely conserved − <dig> region, while the − <dig> region showed three variants. on the other hand the − <dig> region and − <dig> regions for the three other σh-dependent promoters  were each completely conserved across all  <dig> genomes. by comparison, sigh was found to be present in all  <dig> genomes with a high level of conservation . overall, these data indicate considerable conservation of σh-dependent promoters identified, even though some promoters show lineage or strain specific sequence features. comparative analysis of the frequency of nucleotide changes within the − <dig> and − <dig> signal regions compared to the non-functional sequences  between these two functional regions suggests that both − <dig> and − <dig> signals are under selective pressure among the l. monocytogenes strains analyzed . this suggests that the σh-dependent promoters identified in this study are functional across all l. monocytogenes strains and, therefore, are probably important for l. monocytogenes physiology at certain conditions that remain to be established. future studies are needed to explore the functional importance of the polymorphic sequence features. interestingly, a previous study  <cit>  found evidence for positive selection of a promoter region that regulates virulence gene expression in l. monocytogenes. the sites found under positive selection in this previous study generated a putative σb-dependent promoter in some lineage i strains, which supports that strain and lineage specific promoter region polymorphisms may affect virulence gene expression in l. monocytogenes.fig.  <dig> sequence logos for σh-dependent promoters. a sequence logos for the six σh-dependent promoters found in this study based on alignment of 24 l. monocytogenes strains. − <dig> and − <dig> regions are shown. b sequence logo of the consensus sequence of σh-dependent promoters based on alignment of sequences from  <cit>

σh promoters and the σh regulon have diverged among different listeria species
further analysis of the six σh-dependent promoters identified in l. monocytogenes showed that only the lmrg_ <dig> and lmrg_ <dig> promoters were found in all  <dig> listeria species analyzed . the comga promoter was not found in the l. welshimeri genome . the comea promoter was not found in the l. ivanovii and l. welshimeri genomes and the coia and lytg promoters were only found in the l. monocytogenes genomes. analyses of the genes transcribed by these promoters revealed the respective genes were also missing in the genomes where a promoter could not be found. therefore, the competence genes represented by the comgabcdefg operon, the comeabc operon and the coia gene are not found across all listeria species and the σh regulon is not conserved across these species. taking into consideration that a sigh mutant has been shown to have reduced virulence in a mouse model  <cit> , the absence of these σh-dependent genes in non-pathogenic listeria spp. could indicate that these genes may have evolved to contribute σh-dependent virulence related functions in l. monocytogenes. by comparison, sigh was present in all listeria species genomes; in addition to the  <dig> polymorphic amino acid residues found in l. monocytogenes, a further  <dig> polymorphic amino acid residues were found in the listeria spp. genomes.

among the promoters found in other listeria species besides l. monocytogenes, only the lmrg_ <dig> operon was highly conserved . this promoter showed a completely conserved − <dig> region, while two variants of the − <dig> region were found. the comea promoter, which was only found in l. monocytogenes, l. innocua and l. seeligeri, had a perfectly conserved − <dig> region across all three species. however, besides the two variants of the − <dig> region found among the l. monocytogenes strains, each the l. innocua and the l. seeligeri strain presented distinct − <dig> sequences. the comga promoter showed variable − <dig> and − <dig> regions across the listeria species. the lmrg_ <dig> - <dig> sequence in l. innocua, l. ivanovii, l. welshimeri and l. seeligeri matched that of the l. monocytogenes strains. the only − <dig> region that diverged from the others was that found in the l. ivanovii strain. therefore, in addition to a σh regulon that is not conserved across all listeria species, there is also some variation in the σh-dependent promoters that are present in other listeria species. while the σh-dependent promoters present generally seem to be conserved enough to suggest conservation of σh-dependent regulation, future experimental studies are needed to explore the potential functional importance of these polymorphic sequence features.fig.  <dig> alignment of σh-dependent promoters found in listeria species. l. monocytogenes strains 10403s , f <dig>  and hcc <dig>  are used for comparison. − <dig> and − <dig> regions are shown



CONCLUSIONS
combined with prior data that indicated a role of σh in virulence in a mouse model, identification of a number of σh-dependent l. monocytogenes competence genes that are conserved in the pathogen l. monocytogenes, but not in other non-pathogenic listeria strains, suggests a possible novel role of σh-dependent competence genes in l. monocytogenes virulence. the development and use of a sliding window approach to identify differential transcription using rna-seq data not only allowed for identification of new σh-dependent promoters in l. monocytogenes, but also provides a general approach for sensitive identification of differentially transcribed promoters and genes. we predict that this approach will be particularly valuable for identification of differentially transcribed genes and genomic regions that are transcribed from multiple and possibly redundant promoter elements.
