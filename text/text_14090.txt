BACKGROUND
african animal trypanosomiasis , caused by the protozoan parasites trypanosoma congolense, t. vivax and t. brucei brucei, is a wasting disease the affects cattle in much of central africa. transmission of the disease occurs though the saliva of infected tsetse flies . characteristic waves of parasitaemia ensue with intermittent fever and the major clinical sign, anemia, develops  <cit> . other symptoms include lymphoid enlargement, loss of condition and immunosuppression with reduced host resistance to secondary infections  <cit> . human african trypanosomiasis , or sleeping sickness, caused by t. brucei gambiense and t. brucei rhodesiense infection is still a major public health problem in  <dig> african countries. it has been estimated that between  <dig>  to  <dig>  people are currently infected  <cit> .

while other pathogens evade innate and adaptive responses in the plasma by hiding in a host cell, african trypanosomes are unique for being able to multiply and survive in the blood of their mammalian host  <cit> . in this regard, african trypanosomes have evolved an array of host evasion mechanisms, including the phenomenon of antigenic variation of the variable surface glycoprotein  to successfully inhabit the extracellular space, as in the case with t. congolense, in full view of the host immune system  <cit> .

aat is a major constraint to livestock production in sub-saharan african, where the disease is endemic. it occurs across an area of roughly seven million km <dig>  puts approximately  <dig> million cattle at risk in  <dig> countries, and is estimated to cost livestock producers and consumers more than one billion us dollars annually  <cit> . although the majority of cattle in africa are susceptible to the disease, some west african bos taurus cattle populations have evolved a level of tolerance to trypanosomiasis termed trypanotolerance  <cit> . these include the n'dama breed, which offers the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying trypanotolerance when contrasted with the response of a trypanosusceptible breed such as the east african boran .

n'dama cattle, although equally susceptible to the initial infection, survive and are productive in areas of tsetse challenge without the use of trypanocidal drugs  <cit> . this is achieved through a superior ability to control parasite proliferation, control anaemia and maintain body weight  <cit> . research focused on the susceptible and tolerant host responses to trypanosome infection presents an opportunity to identify the poorly understood mechanisms underlying trypanotolerance.

a previous transcriptional profiling study with trypanosusceptible boran used a cdna microarray platform  <cit> . that study contributed to our understanding of the temporal transcriptional response of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  in vivo to a controlled trypanosome infection and identified time points with the greatest numbers of differentially expressed genes. subsequently, a cytokine mrna profiling study examined the immune response of both trypanosusceptible and trypanotolerant cattle pbmc to infection  <cit> . the cytokine profiling study reported that transcript levels for the il <dig>  il <dig> and il1rn genes were significantly downregulated across the time course in both breeds. additionally, there were increases in transcripts for genes encoding proinflammatory mediators  in n'dama by  <dig> days dpi compared with pre-infection levels. and by peak parasitaemia, a type  <dig> helper t cell -like cytokine environment was prevalent in the trypanosusceptible boran with increases in transcripts for the il <dig> and il <dig> genes. overall, the data suggested that the trypanotolerant n'dama were more capable of responding very early in infection. additionally, the trend of a greater magnitude of a th2-like response in the boran would not be expected to facilitate clearance of the trypanosomes and resolve infection.

in the present study, we have employed bovine long oligonucleotide  microarrays and real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr  to catalogue and analyze gene expression changes in pbmc from trypanotolerant and trypanosusceptible cattle following an experimental challenge with t. congolense. the results presented in this study significantly enhance our understanding of the global transcriptional response to trypanosome infection in mammalian pbmc. in addition, they also shed light on regulatory gene expression events that may underlie the phenomena of trypanotolerance and trypanosusceptibility in african cattle. this study reveals changes in the transcriptional profiles of genes involved in a diverse range of biological processes; the findings greatly expand on previous transcriptional profiling studies with trypanosusceptible boran  <cit>  and complements work describing cytokine responses of these animals to trypanosome infection  <cit> .

RESULTS
overview of gene expression changes in n'dama and boran cattle
fig. 1a shows the schema used for the microarray hybridizations between the individual animal pbmc rna samples and a common reference rna pool. fig. 1b shows the experimental design used for the trypanosome infection challenge experiments with eight boran and eight n'dama cattle; also shown are the gene expression contrasts across the time course for each breed, and the gene expression contrasts between breeds at each time point. the numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes detected either over the time course or between the breeds using blo microarrays after adjustment for multiple testing using the false discovery rate correction  are detailed in table  <dig> and shown graphically in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  the blo microarray expression data generated was deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus  repository  <cit>  with experiment series accession .

a de: differentially expressed

expressed genes are defined as those having foreground ≥ background + <dig> sd in ≥ 50% of microarrays in any group of microarrays for a contrast.

numbers of differentially expressed genes  are based on a total of  <dig>  genes and are fdr-adjusted.

for the between breed contrasts, increased expression indicates higher in n'dama compared to boran and decreased expression indicates higher in boran compared to n'dama.

the greatest numbers of differentially expressed genes  were evident in pbmc from infected n'dama at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi . these changes represented 12% and 11% of all gene features on the blo microarray at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively. overall, the total number of significant differentially expressed genes at each time point indicated temporal differences in the response of trypanotolerant n'dama and trypanosusceptible boran cattle to trypanosome infection . this translated to a 10-fold difference in the magnitude of response in n'dama relative to boran at the earliest post-infection time point of  <dig> dpi  compared to pre-infection. generally, throughout the time course, a trend emerged where more genes showed decreased expression within each group post-infection relative to pre-infection. although, for some contrasts  comparable numbers of genes increased and decreased in expression . the greatest magnitude of differences in responses between breeds, over the time course, was apparent at  <dig> dpi with a total of  <dig> genes detected as differentially expressed, including  <dig> showing increased expression in n'dama relative to boran and  <dig> increased in boran relative to n'dama representing  <dig> % of genes on the blo microarray. the range in fold changes detected using the blo microarray across the time course varied from  <dig> -fold decreased expression to  <dig> -fold increased expression.

analysis of over-represented functional categories
the most significantly over-represented gene ontology  categories, classified according to biological process  are presented for each breed over time, and between breeds in table  <dig>  over-representation analysis of gene ontology showed that by  <dig> dpi, the boran had increased go categories representation in a broad range of processes, which were not directly or obviously involved in the immune response, including sodium ion transport, sphingolipid catabolism and neurotransmitter uptake. at the same time point, for go category classified genes in the n'dama, an increase in representation of genes involved in rna and mrna metabolic processes was apparent. later in the time course, a predominance of immune-related processes was evident in the go classification. at  <dig> dpi, the oxygen and reaction oxygen species metabolism and t cell proliferation processes were over-represented in the boran group; while at the same time point in the n'dama group, a wide range of processes were detected as over-represented including regulation of cytokine production, endocytosis, regulation of chemotaxis and leukocyte activation. at the final time point of  <dig> dpi an increase in genes involved in translation, signal transduction and defence response was observed in the boran group relative to pre-infection. concomitantly, differentially expressed genes in n'dama showed a higher proportion of genes involved in defence responses, signalling and immunoglobulin mediated immune responses. in relation to breed differences, a relatively large number of biological processes were detected as significantly over-represented before infection and that number was only surpassed at  <dig> dpi when a larger number of diverse over-represented processes were detected including, erythrocyte differentiation, translation, response to biotic stimulus, defence response, amino acid biosynthesis and rna export from the nucleus.

real time qrt-pcr profiles of candidate genes in n'dama and boran
in light of the wide range of biological processes over-represented in the ontology analysis in response to trypanosome infection, a diverse set of genes was subsequently selected from the output of the microarray data analysis for real time qrt-pcr validation. a list of  <dig> genes  involved in many different physiological processes including: regulation of transcription, regulation of protein biosynthesis, immune response, intracellular protein transport, protein phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, biosynthetic pathways and response to stress were selected for microarray data validation and further investigation of the differentially activated molecular mechanisms. the graphs shown in figs.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which represent the mean fold changes, show the changing mrna profiles for each breed over the entire time course. overall, similar trends in mrna expression emerged for subsets of profiles including, the most frequently observed trends of a general increase, or a general decrease in expression over time in one or both breeds. another pattern of expression detected was an early increase  in expression followed by either a decrease or no further change in one or both breeds.

gene
the first nine genes from the panel of  <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig> and generally increase in expression for one or both groups of cattle and include the expression profiles for gfm <dig>  cd <dig>  rsf <dig>  stx <dig>  scamp <dig>  cybb, gmps, map4k <dig> and ltb. the mrna for the g elongation factor mitochondrial  <dig> protein , one of three factors required by the elongation stage of the mitochondrial translation system, significantly increased in expression in pbmc from the n'dama cattle over time and was consistently higher in n'dama compared to boran at all time points. the expression of the gfm <dig> gene failed to increase significantly in pbmc from the boran cattle over the time course; pbmc from n'dama, on the other hand, displayed highly significant increases at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi in particular compared to pre-infection levels . the difference in expression detected at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> -fold higher in n'dama compared to boran , was one of the most significant breed differences detected in this study.

significant, parallel increases in the mrna expression level for the cd <dig> molecule, a membrane co-receptor found on all b cells were observed in n'dama and boran post-infection. the highly significant two- to three-fold increases were particularly evident after  <dig> dpi, when parasites were first apparent in the blood. in particular, the cd <dig> gene was highly significantly increased in expression in pbmc from n'dama  and boran  at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection. endogenous mrna levels of the chromatin remodelling and spacing factor  <dig> gene  were significantly different between pbmc from n'dama and boran before infection . however, following experimental infection, the profiles of rsf <dig> expression in both breeds showed very similar overall levels between breeds as n'dama significantly increased in expression to a maximal level of  <dig> -fold, p =  <dig> , at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection while expression in boran remained relatively stable throughout.

the stx <dig> gene – encoding a protein involved in post-golgi vesicle-mediated trafficking of proteins from the plasma membrane to endosomes and lysosomes – is another example of a gene with significantly increased expression in pbmc from n'dama over time while remaining relatively stable in pbmc from boran cattle. at  <dig> dpi, in particular, when maximum levels of stx <dig> mrna were observed in n'dama  compared to pre-infection, n'dama had  <dig> -fold higher levels of stx <dig> mrna relative to boran . in addition to stx <dig>  the secretory carrier membrane protein  <dig> gene  is also categorized under the gene ontology biological process termed 'post-golgi vesicle-mediated protein transport.' before infection, the boran group displayed a significant  <dig> -fold higher level of scamp <dig> mrna compared to n'dama ; however, expression levels remained reasonably constant after infection with no significant changes detected. conversely, n'dama, although starting with almost two-fold lower levels of the scamp <dig> transcript had significantly increased expression of scamp <dig> by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold over the time course. at  <dig> dpi, in particular, a highly significant two-fold increase in expression of the scamp <dig> gene was detected in pbmc from the n'dama group  relative to pre-infection levels.

the cytochrome b- <dig>  beta polypeptide gene  encodes a gp- <dig> phox  protein, which is a critical component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes. the cybb gene was observed to increase in mrna expression in pbmc from both breeds relative to pre-infection over the time course. however, the increase in expression in the n'dama group was more uniform and sustained over time  resulting in highly significant increases in cybb expression from  <dig> dpi onwards .

the guanine monophosphate synthetase gene , which encodes a protein involved in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides  was highly significantly increased in expression in pbmc from n'dama after  <dig> dpi post-infection until the end of the time course relative to pre-infection levels. during this time, the expression levels in boran were never significantly different to pre-infection levels. n'dama showed an increase in expression that was particularly evident at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi,  respectively, which resulted in significant breed differences at those times . therefore, although the absolute mean mrna levels were similar before infection and at  <dig> dpi for both breeds, during the first wave of parasitaemia, n'dama expressed significantly higher levels of the gmps transcript.

mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase  <dig> , also known as germinal centre kinase like kinase , is a member of the ser/thr protein kinase family and is thought to function in response to stress, specifically activating the jun n-terminal kinase  signalling pathway. despite an almost significant  <dig> -fold higher level of map4k <dig> mrna in the boran group relative to n'dama before infection ; the n'dama group had significantly higher expression levels of map4k <dig> at  <dig> dpi   <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi  relative to the boran. this was the result of highly significant increases in map4k <dig> expression in n'dama that were evident at the time points after  <dig> dpi . these changes in n'dama were coupled with moderate and less significant increases in the boran group  relative to pre-infection levels.

the lymphotoxin beta gene  involved in the inflammatory response and the normal development of lymphoid tissues, showed increasing levels of expression in the n'dama and boran groups that were significant after  <dig> dpi. increases were comparable for both breeds with maximal levels in n'dama at  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi in boran  compared to pre-infection. a marginally higher response was observed for the n'dama: a  <dig> -fold higher level of ltb expression relative to boran at  <dig> dpi .

fourteen genes  had profiles of expression that generally decreased over time in pbmc from one or both breeds after infection . a subset of these genes  behaved similarly, displaying coordinated patterns of expression in pbmc from both the n'dama and boran groups with no significant breed differences in gene expression after trypanosome infection. decreased expression was particularly marked for these genes from  <dig> dpi.

the cd3e molecule, epsilon  gene  encodes a cell differentiation antigen, which is part of the tcr-cd <dig> complex of t-lymphocytes and is involved in the positive regulation of t cell proliferation through generation of intracellular signal when antigen is bound to the tcr. highly significant decreases in cd3e mrna were detected in pbmc at  <dig> dpi  relative to pre-infection levels, which was sustained throughout the time course. similarly, the dual specificity phosphatase  <dig> gene , which is a key regulator of the immune response through its role in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of map kinases, had significantly decreased expression from  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection in pbmc from the n'dama and boran groups. the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats  <dig> gene  displayed an mrna expression profile that showed a sharp decrease in pbmc at  <dig> dpi compared to pre-infection that was comparable for both breeds.

the lymphotoxin beta receptor  gene  encodes a receptor for the heterotrimeric lymphotoxin membrane form , which is involved in the development of lymphoid tissue, the immune response and apoptosis. the expression of ltbr in pbmc from both animal groups generally decreased after  <dig> dpi; interestingly, however, a modest increase  was detected at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection in the n'dama group. fluctuations in pbmc mrna expression were observed for the pirin  gene , which encodes a transcriptional cofactor that interacts with the protein product of the nuclear factor i/c  gene . however, there was a clear tight co-ordinate response in pbmc expression between n'dama and boran over the whole time course. the v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene  displayed an expression profile that showed highly significant and substantial decreases – again, in a coordinated fashion – between the n'dama and boran groups, which were particularly apparent from  <dig> dpi onwards relative to pre-infection levels.

five of the subset of genes shown in fig.  <dig> that generally decreased in expression across the time course  were similarly regulated in the n'dama and boran groups and were comparable to the genes described above; however, the magnitude of response varied between the breeds and resulted in significant differences between the n'dama and boran groups at one or more time points. the cd <dig> molecule gene , an lps- and apoptotic cell-binding molecule that is preferentially expressed on monocytes and macrophages had  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  lower levels of expression at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively in pbmc from the n'dama group relative to the boran animals.

the pbmc mrna expression profiles of the ccaat/enhancer binding protein , beta gene  in the n'dama and boran groups tracked each other across the time course with the exception of  <dig> dpi, where the boran had  <dig> -fold  higher levels of cebpb mrna relative to the n'dama. the pbmc gene expression profiles of the timp metallopeptidase inhibitor  <dig> gene  diverged from  <dig> dpi, after which the boran appeared to stabilize and the n'dama continued to decrease in expression of timp <dig> mrna. this breed divergence in timp <dig> expression subsequently resulted in higher levels of timp <dig> mrna expression in the boran relative to the n'dama at  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi .

the mrna expression profiles for the intracellular adhesion molecule  <dig> gene  were consistently lower in pbmc from the n'dama compared to the boran animals at  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi . over the entire time course, modest changes in expression occurred for the mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> gene . despite this, at  <dig> dpi a significantly greater mrna abundance of mapk <dig> was observed in pbmc from boran relative to n'dama .

three genes that generally decreased in expression over the time course displayed pbmc expression profiles that varied significantly between the n'dama and boran groups . although selenoprotein p, plasma  <dig> gene  mrna expression decreased in n'dama and boran over time; at almost all time points examined, boran had significantly higher levels of sepp <dig> mrna relative to n'dama. similarly, expression of a transcriptional activator, the nuclear factor, interleukin  <dig> regulated gene  generally decreased in both breeds over time; however, at  <dig> dpi the boran displayed a highly significant  <dig> -fold  increase of nfil <dig> mrna relative to the n'dama. the solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig> gene , which plays an essential role in iron ion homeostasis produced pbmc mrna expression profiles across the time course that were among the most divergent in terms of differences in response between breeds. expression levels of scl40a <dig> mrna did not significantly change in boran over time, although there was tendency to increased expression; however, expression levels in the n'dama were markedly depressed at  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi  relative to pre-infection levels. these changes resulted in significantly higher levels of slc40a <dig> mrna in boran relative to n'dama at  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi ,  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi .

the mrna expression profiles of two genes across the time course  showed a pattern of early coordinate expression followed by later divergence in pbmc from the two groups of animals . the rab <dig>  member ras oncogene family gene  encodes a member of the rab family, which are major regulators of intracellular protein transport. minor fluctuations in expression are observed before  <dig> dpi; however, by  <dig> dpi n'dama displayed higher mrna levels of rab <dig> mrna relative to boran . conversely, the expression levels of the nuclear factor -like  <dig> gene  were reduced after  <dig> dpi in n'dama  while they fluctuated in boran to a large extent over the time course. the result at  <dig> dpi was a  <dig> -fold higher level of nfe2l <dig> mrna in the boran relative to the n'dama .

the final series of pbmc expression profiles consists of seven genes also shown in fig.  <dig>  with mrna levels that followed a trend of increasing early with a subsequent decrease or no further increase in one or both breeds. the first five of these genes  have comparable expression profiles for n'dama and boran and therefore have no significant breed differences after infection; the last three , on the other hand, have diverging profiles and significant differences between n'dama and boran at either  <dig> or  <dig> dpi. the granzyme b  gene  encodes a protease necessary for target cell lysis in cell-mediated immune responses. the gzmb gene exhibited a significant peak in mrna expression at  <dig> dpi in both breeds  relative to pre-infection values. expression levels of the lysozyme  gene  did not change significantly in pbmc from the boran over time, although they did tend to decrease over time. in contrast to this, the n'dama showed an initial  <dig> -fold increase  in lyz mrna abundance at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection that was followed by later decreases in expression. a single, modest but significant, increase in xanthine dehydrogenase gene  expression was detected at  <dig> dpi in n'dama relative to pre-infection levels . guanylate binding protein  <dig> gene  pbmc expression profiles for the n'dama and boran were synchronized after infection, with an early highly significant peak in expression at  <dig> dpi  followed by a reduction in expression in both breeds.

the three last gene expression profiles  exhibit trends of early increases in expression in one or both breeds with significant differences between n'dama and boran at  <dig> or  <dig> dpi. the cathepsin s gene  encodes a thiol protease that is responsible for the removal of the invariant chain from mhc class ii molecules, thereby functioning in mhc class ii-associated chain processing and peptide loading in the immune response. the mrna expression profiles of ctss expression in pbmc from n'dama and boran over the time course were strikingly different. there was no increase in ctss mrna abundance in boran post-infection; conversely, a highly significant increase in ctss gene expression was observed for the n'dama group at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection . these fluctuations resulted in a  <dig> -fold higher level of ctss mrna in n'dama relative to boran at  <dig> dpi . the natural cytoxicity triggering receptor  <dig> gene  that may contribute to the increased efficiency of activated nk cells to lyse cells in the inflammatory response, showed a significant increase in gene expression in the n'dama group at  <dig> dpi  relative to pre-infection. additionally, although ncr <dig> mrna expression was reduced in n'dama at  <dig> dpi, there was a significant  <dig> -fold higher level of ncr <dig> mrna  in n'dama relative to boran at this time. the tumour necrosis factor  superfamily, member  <dig> b gene  that encodes a potent b cell activating cytokine , which plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of b cells, is abundantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes. in this study, tnfsf13b mrna expression was highly significantly elevated in pbmc from n'dama at  <dig> dpi  and significantly increased at  <dig> dpi  relative to pre-infection levels. despite moderate fluctuations in tnfsf13b expression over time in the boran, no significant differences were detected relative to pre-infection levels. finally, at  <dig> dpi pbmc from the n'dama had  <dig> -fold higher mrna levels of tnfsf13b relative to the boran .

discussion
this study describes large-scale transcriptional profiling of pbmc from naïve trypanosusceptible boran and trypanotolerant n'dama using bovine long oligonucleotide  microarrays following experimental t. congolense infection. a number of differentially expressed genes were selected from the results of the microarray analysis for real time qrt-pcr validation. this study builds on previous work that encompassed immunospecific microarray analyses of boran experimentally infected with trypanosomes  <cit>  and cytokine mrna profiling with immune cell subpopulation analyses  <cit> . when the physiological parameters of parasitaemia and packed cell volume are taken into account, the findings described here can be placed in a broader and more meaningful setting. within this context, the opportunity therefore exists to examine not only how the host responds to infection over time, but also to consider possible mechanisms that might contribute to trypanotolerance as represented by the superior response of n'dama cattle to trypanosome infection.

phenotypic responses across the infection time course
as previously described, the cattle in this study exhibited typical phenotypic responses as measured by parasitaemia and packed red blood cell volume   <cit> . the kinetics of parasitaemia showed the first peak of parasitaemia occurring between 15– <dig> dpi. rates of decline in pcv were similar for n'dama and boran up to  <dig> dpi but thereafter the kinetics of anaemia diverged and the decline in pcv in boran was more pronounced than that for n'dama, such that the boran displayed significantly lower pcv measures compared to the n'dama at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. also, broadly speaking there were increases in the proportion of b cells  and reductions in the proportions of various t cell subpopulations  over the course of infection.

gene expression contrasts and gene expression changes for the two breeds
the numbers of differentially expressed genes for each contrast  were tabulated and are presented in table  <dig>  the most striking feature from these figures is the larger number of genes that were classified as differentially expressed in n'dama at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  relative to pre-infection compared to any other contrast. the numbers of differentially expressed genes represented approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all gene features on the blo microarray at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively. these data suggest that there are chronological differences in the transcriptional response of n'dama and boran to trypanosome infection. this is also apparent at the early time point of  <dig> dpi, where an approximate 10-fold higher magnitude of response was observed in n'dama relative to boran compared to pre-infection. it is therefore likely that the relatively rapid transcriptional response observed in n'dama after infection may contribute to a more favourable outcome; perhaps reflecting early innate events while the adaptive immune response is established.

in general, comparisons of the differential expression profiles showed more genes decreased in expression in response to experimental infection, than were induced. for the many contrasts examined across the time course, it is important to note, that more genes were decreased than increased in expression . this may seem counterintuitive for an immune response that is being mounted towards a blood-borne parasite; however, the effect of managing an appropriate immune response in an effort to limit immunopathology   <cit>  and the possibility of host-pathogen interactions   <cit>  could give rise to a downregulation of host gene expression. additionally, the preponderance of genes decreased in expression may reflect a decrease in the proportions of cell types expressing these transcripts, highlighting the importance of the between breed contrasts. with this in mind, the greatest magnitude of breed difference over the time course was apparent at  <dig> dpi. it appears that the numbers of genes differentially expressed between n'dama and boran initially decreases, so that the breeds become more similar at  <dig> dpi than they were before infection. considered together, these results indicate that the differences observed prior to infection may simply reflect the different genetic backgrounds of the two populations. however, when challenged with the same pathogen, where neither breed is resistant to the initial infection, their transcriptional profiles  are relatively similar. subsequently, at  <dig> dpi, the n'dama and boran cattle become more divergent than they were before infection. differences in the breed profiles at this time reflect the diverging response to infection between the trypanotolerant and trypanotolerant cattle, which was also evident from their pcv scores.

gene ontology over-representation analysis: involvement of diverse cellular processes
a useful method to understand the predominating responses is go classification of differentially expressed genes. the response to trypanosome infection in the two breeds was also examined using gene ontology  over-representation analysis of the blo microarray gene expression data . the over-represented ontology categories are generated from differentially expressed genes and may therefore contain genes with increased and decreased expression within each category, thereby representing overall increased activity for a particular biological process. a number of general observations can be made based on the over-representation results, which only included the most significant findings . firstly, although only represented by relatively few genes, the early response in boran at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection was characterized by a diverse range of ontology categories including sodium ion transport, sphingolipid catabolism and neurotransmitter uptake. at the same time the response in n'dama was characterized entirely by rna and mrna metabolic processes, which may reflect a heightened activation status in the pbmc of n'dama at  <dig> dpi. at the height of parasitaemia, further immune-related processes were represented in addition to a range of physiological processes. by  <dig> dpi compared to pre-infection in boran, oxygen and reaction oxygen species metabolism, t cell proliferation and cell-cell signalling processes were over-represented. these processes could reflect a changing host environment where parasitaemia is now high and the susceptible host is struggling to mount a successful immune response. concurrently, the response in n'dama is characterized by increased expression for genes involved in a range of biological processes including regulation of cytokine production and chemotaxis, endocytosis, cell motility and leukocyte activation – all of which are expected to be beneficial for the host.

as the infection time course advanced, the ontology categories increasingly included those related to signalling and the defence response. by  <dig> dpi, cellular processes involved in translation, regulation of amino acid phosphorylation, ras protein signal transduction, oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes and the defence response were affected in boran relative to pre-infection. biological processes affected in the n'dama group at  <dig> dpi also included oxygen and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes and defence response; however, additional ontology categories included response to biotic stimulus, immunoglobulin mediated immune responses and antimicrobial humoral response. it is noteworthy that breed differences with respect to the number of differentially expressed genes were high before infection and maximal at  <dig> dpi. this resulted in a variety of biological processes that were affected or had genes over-represented differently between n'dama and boran. this included genes involved in arginine metabolic processes, erythrocyte differentiation, translation, response to biotic stimulus, defence response, amino acid biosynthesis and rna export from the nucleus. the diversity of ontology categories over-represented at  <dig> dpi between trypanotolerant n'dama and trypanosusceptible boran, would support the hypothesis that the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of trypanotolerance may be varied and multifaceted  <cit> . in light of the observation that a range of cellular processes underlie the phenomenon of trypanotolerance, a diverse panel of genes were chosen as candidates for real time qrt-pcr validation .

evidence for heightened b cell responses in trypanotolerant n'dama cattle
evidence of a rise in b cell responses including antigen processing and presentation was evident in the transcriptional profiles of a number of genes. these include genes involved in processes such as post-golgi vesicle-mediated protein transport , regulation of intracellular protein trafficking , mhc class ii-associated chain processing and peptide loading , and b cell activating factor  in addition to the b cell co-receptor . these processes are all involved in mounting a successful b cell response to infection.

post-golgi vesicle-mediated processes are represented by both stx <dig> and scamp <dig> in this study. syntaxin  <dig> , is a member of a family of transmembrane proteins that have been implicated as vesicle receptors involved in vesicle docking and fusion and stx <dig> has been proposed to have a role in vesicle trafficking between the golgi complex and lysosomes and has been shown to be associated with the early endosome  <cit> . secretory carrier membrane proteins  1– <dig> are ubiquitously expressed and major components of the eukaryotic cell surface recycling system that shuttles between the plasma membrane, endosomes and the trans-golgi complex  <cit>  and have been shown to participate in endocytosis  <cit> . stx <dig> and scamp <dig> transcript levels, which generally increased over the time course, were only significantly increased in expression in n'dama relative to pre-infection and at  <dig> dpi n'dama had  <dig> -fold higher levels of stx <dig> mrna relative to boran.

rab <dig> encodes a protein that is a member of the rab family, which is localized to the plasma membrane and endocytic compartments, is involved in the regulation of the endocytic pathway  <cit> . after the first wave of parasitaemia an increase in rab <dig> mrna expression was apparent in n'dama, which was significantly but modestly higher relative to boran at  <dig> dpi.

the cathepsin s gene  encodes a lysosomal cysteine protease that is responsible for the removal/processing of the invariant chain from mhc class ii molecules, thereby functioning in mhc class ii-associated chain processing, peptide loading and maturation. the profiles of ctss expression in n'dama and boran over time were remarkably different; there was no increase in ctss expression in boran post-infection and in general the trend of expression was towards decreased expression. conversely, a highly significant increase in ctss expression for n'dama at  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection was observed. the result of these different trends was higher ctss mrna abundance in n'dama relative to boran at the early time point of  <dig> dpi, when parasites were just appearing in the bloodstream.

the transcript for b cell-activating factor gene  encodes a potent b cell activating cytokine that has important roles in b-cell homeostasis including b-cell growth, survival, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . in this study, baff mrna expression was highly significantly elevated in n'dama at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection levels and despite moderate fluctuations in baff expression over time in boran, no significant differences were detected relative to pre-infection levels. significantly at  <dig> dpi, n'dama had higher mrna levels of baff relative to boran.

the parallel, highly significant, increase in cd <dig> expression  in n'dama and boran might indicate that cd <dig> plays a key role in the response to trypanosome infection and that role is equally employed by both tolerant and susceptible cattle. the timing of the response has an appropriate association with the function of cd <dig> in the host immune response to infection, where significant increases in cd <dig> expression were detected after parasites were first apparent in the bloodstream and highly significant increases were detected at peak parasitaemia. the innate immune response of microbial antigen recognition by complement is coupled to the activation of b cells though the membrane protein complex cd19/cd <dig>  <cit> . this occurs through cd <dig> binding of the c3d fragment of activated c <dig> that is covalently attached to targets of complement activation  and subsequently cd <dig> co-stimulates or enhances signalling through the b cell receptor  <cit> . early increases in cd <dig> expression, after parasites and parasite antigens are accessible, is clearly an important and fundamental response to infection mounted by both breeds of cattle, allowing the integration of innate and adaptive immune recognition at the b cell to subsequently promote an appropriate adaptive immune response. cumulatively, these findings indicate increased activity in b cell responses, specifically b cell co-receptor enhanced signalling, post-golgi vesicle-mediated protein transport, mhc class ii maturation, which are complemented by increased levels of the b cell activating factor. these responses appear to be more pronounced in the n'dama than in the boran cattle after infection and the overall result would feasibly result in a more efficient or appropriate b cell response in trypanotolerant cattle.

additional immune responses
a number of additional genes that play important roles in the immune response to infection were also increased in expression in response to trypanosome infection . granzyme b, the product of the gzmb gene, is a serine protease that is an important mediator of target-cell apoptosis  by cells such as natural killer cells  and cytotoxic cd8+ t cells  <cit> . the early increase in expression of gzmb mrna may indicate a role for this serine protease in response to trypanosome infection, important in both breeds when parasites are first apparent in the bloodstream.

lysozyme  and cytochrome b- <dig>  are both involved in the killing of microbes when phagocytosis has occurred  <cit> . lysozyme, is involved in the lysosomal-dependent killing mechanism where the phagosome containing ingested microbes fuses with lysosomes to form a phagolysosome  <cit> . cytochrome b- <dig>  on the other hand, is involved in the lysosome-independent  killing mechanism, such that oxygen radicals are generated inside the phagocytic vacuole that kill the microbe. the initial increase in expression of the lyz gene in pbmc from n'dama may be beneficial in the killing of trypanosomes ingested by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the phagolysosome of these cells. a highly significant and sustained increase in the expression of cybb mrna expression was detected in n'dama after infection over the entire time course. overall, however, the increase in cybb expression suggests an important role for this molecule in the response to trypanosome infection in tolerant and susceptible cattle.

the natural cytoxicity triggering receptor  <dig> gene  encodes the nkp <dig> protein and is expressed on resting and activated natural killer cells  <cit> . nkp <dig> is one of a group of triggering receptors responsible for positive nk cell stimulation and the process of natural cytotoxicity  <cit> . notably, a recent study reported an association with a promoter polymorphism in the ncr <dig> gene and mild malaria attacks and a haplotype that contained the polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of mild malaria  <cit> . in the present study a significant increase in ncr <dig> expression was detected in n'dama at  <dig> dpi, when parasites appeared in the bloodstream, relative to pre-infection. this expression pattern could possibly contribute to a superior nk cell function at this critical time in trypanotolerant cattle.

nucleic acid synthesis and the stress response
transcripts for the gmps and map4k <dig> genes showed significant breed differences post-infection where the trypanotolerant n'dama had higher levels of expression. the guanine monophosphate synthetase gene  encodes an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides  and is elevated in rapidly growing cells  <cit> . at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, significantly higher levels of gmps mrna were detected in n'dama. the higher levels of gmps during this time could be an indication of the activation status of cells and might suggest that n'dama had, at this critical time, an elevated activation status where cells were growing more rapidly compared to boran.

the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase  <dig> gene , encodes a member of the ser/thr protein kinase family that functions in response to stress, specifically activating the jun n-terminal kinase  signalling pathway and is thought to have a particular role in germinal centre b cells  <cit> . despite the higher endogenous levels in boran before infection, n'dama had significantly higher expression levels of map4k <dig> mrna at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi relative to boran perhaps indicating a heightened response to stress in trypanotolerant cattle.

regulation of iron transport and homeostasis
anaemia is a significant clinical sign of advancing trypanosome infection; therefore, genes involved in the regulation of iron transport and homeostasis represent interesting candidates to study. one such gene is the solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig> gene , which plays an essential role in iron ion homeostasis  <cit> .

expression levels of slc40a <dig> remained relatively stable in the trypanosusceptible boran, while at the same time they were significantly depressed in n'dama at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi relative to pre-infection. the result of this was significantly higher levels of slc40a <dig> mrna observed in boran relative to n'dama at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi. the product of the slc40a <dig> gene, ferroportin  <dig>  is a main iron export protein. a decrease in ferroportin  <dig> expression, as seen in n'dama, may result in reduced iron export and an increase in intracellular iron levels. high levels of iron, however, are known to be toxic and the action of reduced iron export on trypanosome growth is unknown, therefore the functional consequences of the divergent expression pattern of slc40a <dig> in n'dama and boran remains to be fully elucidated.

other cellular processes
one of the genes examined using real time qrt-pcr  displayed significantly higher expression levels, particularly at  <dig> dpi, in the trypanotolerant n'dama compared to boran. the protein product encoded by the nuclear gene gfm <dig> specifically promotes the gtp-dependent translocation of the nascent protein chain from the a-site to the p- site of the ribosome; therefore, gfm <dig> plays a crucial role in maintaining normal mitochondrial function through translation of mitochondrial encoded genes, including those of the enzyme complexes that perform oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . elongation factors involved in mitochondrial protein biosynthesis could conceivably contribute to the overall rate of translation, resulting in greater mitochondrial mrna translational efficiency with potential benefit for trypanotolerant cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the transcriptional profiles of a diverse range of genes in pbmc are altered in response to trypanosome infection in both tolerant and susceptible cattle. some of these genes appear to be regulated in a similar manner irrespective of breed and are not considered to be involved in trypanotolerance, while others exhibit significant breed differences in expression following infection. indeed temporal differences in the magnitude of the response have suggested that n'dama respond more rapidly to infection and by  <dig> dpi the response to infection is qualitatively different between the breeds as suggested by the over-representation analysis of go categories. the combined effect of a number of these factors  may result in the superior ability of n'dama to control infection.

the results presented here demonstrate that genes regulating a diverse range of physiological processes contribute to the general host response to aat and to the specific responses of trypanotolerant n'dama cattle. further resolution of the significance of these processes could be attained in future experiments on individual cell populations. future work on the findings presented could include data mining studies, specifically of conserved regulatory sequences in the promoter regions of differentially expressed genes using tools such as matinspector and databases such as matbase  <cit> . furthermore, the relationship between the expression of differentially expressed genes that code for secreted proteins and clinical measures of disease could also be fully explored, possibly offering additional insights into the mechanisms of trypanotolerance and trypanosusceptibility.
