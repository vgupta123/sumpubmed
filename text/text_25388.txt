BACKGROUND
during vertebrate development three kidney types of increasing complexity  form successively from the intermediate mesoderm, located between the paraxial mesoderm  and the lateral plate  <cit> . the pronephros is the simplest, functional form of kidney in larval stages of fish and amphibians and consists of three major components: glomus, tubules and duct. in adults the pronephros is replaced by the mesonephros. in mammals the pronephros is not functional, but required for mesonephros formation that is replaced by the metanephros, the kidney of the adult  <cit> .

all components of the pronephros arise from intermediate mesoderm, but the signals that direct pattering of the presumptive pronephric mesoderm towards pronephric lineages are unknown. experiments showed that the anterior somites are crucial for pronephros development and provide an essential first signal. if the anterior somites are removed  <cit>  or separated from the presumptive pronephros  <cit> , pronephroi do not form. anterior somites can also induce pronephric tubules in unspecified intermediate mesoderm  <cit> . although the exact timing and nature of the signal provided by the anterior somites are yet unknown, wnt11b expressed throughout the anterior somites has recently been shown as a crucial signal  <cit> .

xenopus is a very attractive model organism to analyse key molecular events in nephrogenesis, because most genes essential for pronephros development in xenopus embryos are also crucial for the formation of the more complex mammalian kidneys  <cit> . a classical method to identify important molecules in xenopus development is the injection of mrnas or morpholino oligonucleotides into the fertilized egg or into blastomeres of early cleaving stages  <cit> . thus, several pronephric regulators have been functionally identified  <cit> . an additional experimental tool to study early events of nephrogenesis involves explanting the animal pole of the blastula. these explanted animal caps have pluripotency and differentiate into various tissues upon exposure to inducing substances  <cit> . importantly, animal caps treated with activin a and retinoic acid differentiate into pronephros  <cit>  and in this in vitro system genes are induced with similar kinetics as in vivo  <cit> .

in xenopus the first genes expressed in the pronephros anlage are the transcription factors osr <dig> and osr <dig>  members of the odd-skipped family of proteins  <cit> , hnf1b, a member of the homeobox factors  <cit> , lhx <dig> , a lim homeobox factor  <cit>  as well as pax <dig>  a member of the paired box domain family  <cit> . we refer to these five transcription factors as the early nephrogenic transcription factors, as they are all expressed in the pronephros anlage prior to cellular differentiation and their misexpression affects pronephros development. inhibition of osr <dig> or osr <dig> by morpholinos in xenopus embryos interferes with kidney formation and embryonic overexpression of either of these factors induces ectopic kidney tissue and enlarged pronephros  <cit> . overexpression of hnf1b inhibits pronephros formation  <cit>  and this effect is also seen by using the human hnf1b  <cit>  implying that the regulatory potential has been conserved during vertebrate evolution. in contrast, lhx <dig> and pax <dig> overexpression leads to an enlargement of the pronephros and, if both factors are coexpressed, this effect is increased and even induces ectopic pronephric tubules  <cit> .

it should be noted that each of these five early nephrogenic transcription factors plays also a crucial role in the development of other organs. the prominent role of these nephrogenic transcription factors is partially also evident in mammalian systems. whereas null mutation of osr <dig> in mice exhibit agenesis of the kidney  <cit> , osr <dig> knock-out has no kidney phenotype  <cit> , although osr <dig> transcripts are expressed in the developing kidney  <cit> . the kidney-restricted knockout of hnf1b leads to polycystic kidney disease  <cit>  and the lhx <dig> null mutant even lacks any kidney  <cit> . in contrast, pax <dig> deficient mice exhibit thyroid gland deficiency, but have no pronephric phenotype  <cit> . nevertheless, pax <dig> plays an essential role in kidney development, as impaired metanephros formation observed in mice deficient for pax <dig>  <cit>  is dramatically increased by a lack of any nephric cell lineage, if these embryos lack additionally pax <dig>  <cit> .

to further explore the role of these five nephrogenic transcription factors we have now analyzed the kinetics of their induction in animals caps differentiated into pronephric tissue by activin a and retinoic acid. we then have overexpressed these transcription factors in animal caps and analyzed their potential to induce each other and to stimulate pronephric differentiation in these explants. to allow discrimination between injected mrnas and endogenous mrnas we used the human mrnas that are functionally equivalent, but are not detectable with the xenopus probes. we use capital letters for these human transcription factors to make a clear distinction. in addition we identified genes induced by hnf1b in these early embryonic cells.

RESULTS
induction of mrnas encoding the early nephrogenic transcription factors osr <dig>  osr <dig>  hnf1b, lhx <dig> and pax <dig> in animal caps treated with retinoic acid and/or activin a
since simultaneous treatment of xenopus animal caps with  <dig> ng/ml of activin a and 10- <dig> m retinoic acid for three hours induces differentiation of pronephric tissues  <cit> , we explored the time dependent induction of the early nephrogenic transcription factors osr <dig>  osr <dig>  hnf1b, lhx <dig> and pax <dig> in these embryonic explants. thus, we measured by quantitative rt-pcr the induction of the corresponding mrnas in animal caps treated with retinoic acid and activin a . based on the low sample pools  and because we do not know whether the values obtained in various experiments with animal caps represent a normal distribution, the use of a significance test is not appropriate. therefore, we defined genes as induced or repressed, when all the four measured values for a given sample pool represented the same trend. using these criteria all five transcripts were induced, albeit with different kinetics. whereas osr <dig>  osr <dig>  hnf1b and lhx <dig> mrnas were induced within  <dig>  hours, pax <dig> mrna was only increased after thirteen hours. for osr <dig> and osr <dig> the induction increased up to thirteen hour treatment, whereas hnf1b and lhx <dig> seemed to level off at seven hour treatment. by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide, the induction of osr <dig>  hnf1b and lhx <dig> was not abolished implying direct gene activation . the observation that osr <dig> was not induced in this experiment possibly reflects the  <dig> min culture with or without cycloheximide prior to retinoic acid and activin a treatment, since delayed activin a treatment of animal caps reduces the induction potential  <cit> .

to clarify which nephrogenic transcription factor transcripts are induced by retinoic acid or activin a alone, we analyzed animal caps treated with either retinoic acid or activin a for three hours . treatment with retinoic acid failed to induce the nephrogenic transcription factors, but rather decreased the level of osr <dig> and pax <dig> transcripts by 2-fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively. in contrast, activin a treatment induced osr <dig> as well as lhx <dig>  but osr <dig> in two of four experiments only. since hnf1b was not induced by activin a alone, we conclude that a synergistic effect of both inducers is needed to induce hnf1b. the lack of induction of pax <dig> in animal caps treated with activin a or retinoic acid alone is consistent with the no-induction observed in animal caps treated with retinoic acid and activin a for three hours .

overexpression of osr <dig> and osr2a leads to enlargement of pronephros and ectopic pronephric tissue
since the murine osr <dig> gene is expressed in two splice variants referred to as osr2a and osr2b  <cit> , we searched xenopus cdna sequences deposited in genebank for corresponding splice variants. indeed, we identified transcripts encoding the a and b splice variants that encode a five and three finger zinc protein, respectively, comparable to the murine situation . using primers specific for the a and b splice variant we could show that osr2b predominates osr2a by a factor of about three throughout retinoic acid and activin a induction in animal caps .

to examine the morphogenetic potential of the mammalian osr <dig> and osr2a in developing xenopus embryos, we injected mrna encoding the human osr <dig> or the murine osr2a proteins into one blastomere of the two-cell stage embryo using gfp mrna as a marker to identify the injected side. about half of the osr <dig> and more than the half of the osr2a injected embryos showed gastrulation defects that were more severe with higher doses of mrna. injected embryos surviving to the free swimming tadpole stage  <dig>  <cit>  were immunostained for pronephros development using a mixture of the monoclonal antibodies for the proximal tubules  and the distal tubules and pronephric duct   <cit> . the majority of embryos injected with osr <dig> showed an enlarged pronephros , in some cases together with the formation of ectopic kidney cell patches . comparing the size of the pronephros of the injected side with the one of the non-injected side we observed that the pronephros size was significantly enlarged by injecting  <dig> pg osr <dig> but not with  <dig> pg . similarly, osr2a overexpression  leads to a significant increase of pronephros size as well, but we did not observe the formation of ectopic kidney tissue. in conclusion, osr <dig> as well as osr2a overexpression induces pronephros enlargement in xenopus embryos as found previously for the corresponding xenopus factors osr <dig> and osr2b suggesting comparable function of both mammalian genes in pronephros development  <cit> .

overexpression of osr <dig> alone or in combination with retinoic acid or activin a cannot support pronephros differentiation in animal caps
since in our experiments expression of osr <dig> had a lower lethality compared to osr2a and induces ectopic kidney tissues , we investigated the potential of osr <dig> to trigger pronephric differentiation in animal caps. therefore, we injected mrna encoding human osr <dig> into the animal pole of two-cell stage embryos, explanted animal caps at late blastulae and cultured the explants for four days to monitor pronephros differentiation by immunostaining with the pronephros specific antibodies. in a control experiment without mrna injection, but adding retinoic acid as well as activin a, pronephric differentiation was observed. since the extent of differentiation was quite variable between individual caps, we scored the explants into three categories as illustrated in figure 4a. using the distribution into these categories it is clear that retinoic acid combined with activin a induced pronephric differentiation compared to untreated animal caps , demonstrating kidney differentiation in vitro as previously reported  <cit> . however, osr <dig> overexpressing animal caps failed to differentiate and this was not improved by adding retinoic acid or activin a. furthermore, osr <dig> overexpression in animal caps treated with retinoic acid and activin a led to a similar extent of pronephric differentiation compared to uninjected, but treated animal caps. quantitative rt-pcr analysis after three hours showed no induction of the early transcription factors upon osr <dig> expression alone or in combination with retinoic acid, whereas treatment of osr <dig> injected caps with activin a led to an induction of osr <dig>  osr <dig> and lhx <dig> , as observed frequently by activin a treatment alone . as a control we verified the presence of the osr <dig> protein translated from the injected osr <dig> mrna by western blots . taken together, osr <dig> alone or in combination with retinoic acid or activin a does not have the potential to induce pronephros differentiation in animal caps.

lhx <dig> and/or pax <dig> or hnf1b are not sufficient to induce pronephros differentiation in animal caps
it is known that embryonic overexpression of xenopus lhx <dig> or pax <dig> induces enlargement of pronephros and coexpression of both factors leads to a synergistic effect  <cit> . this enlargement of the pronephros we also observed by unilateral injection of the human transcription factors, since coinjected lhx <dig> and pax <dig> result in a pronephros size of  <dig> +/- 42% compared to the control side . however, in contrast to experiments using the xenopus factors  <cit> , no ectopic pronephric tissue formation was seen with the human factors. to investigate the pronephros differentiation potential of human lhx <dig> and pax <dig> in animal caps, we injected mrna encoding these proteins, either alone or in combination, into the animal pole of two-cell stage embryos and analysed the animal caps by immunostaining after four days. both lhx <dig> and pax <dig> alone or in combination could not induce pronephros differentiation in animal caps at day four . measuring the level of the transcripts encoding the five nephrogenic transcription factors after  <dig> hours we observed no change . the missing pronephros formation in animal caps overexpressing lhx <dig> and pax <dig> is consistent with unpublished data reviewed recently  <cit> . to prove successful injection, we confirmed in all embryos green fluorescence derived from the coinjected gfp mrna. in addition, for lhx <dig> injections into animal caps we deduce functional relevant amounts of lhx <dig> protein, as the lhx <dig> target gene cerberus   <cit>  was 6- or 64-fold induced in two independent experiments .

since differential addition of retinoic acid and activin a to animal caps has shown that activin a alone induces osr <dig>  lhx <dig> and frequently also osr <dig>  but never hnf1b that requires retinoic acid in addition , we wondered whether hnf1b injection might replace retinoic acid to get pronephric induction in animal caps. however, injection of hnf1b mrna into the animal pole at the two-cell stage, failed to induce pronephric differentiation in the explanted animal caps, even if cultured in the presence of activin a . in conclusion, lhx <dig>  pax <dig> and hnf1b failed to induce pronephros differentiation in animal caps.

overexpression of hnf1b induces in animal caps genes important for nephrogenesis
since numerous target genes of hnf1b have been defined  <cit>  or postulated  <cit>  in various mammalian systems, we wonder whether these genes are activated in animal caps representing embryonic stem cells. thus, we searched for orthologs present in xenopus ests and selected  <dig> genes reported to be expressed early in xenopus development or in the developing pronephros  <cit> . analysing animal caps of hnf1b injected embryos by quantitative rt-pcr revealed after seven hours a clear increase in transcripts encoding the early nephrogenic transcription factors lhx <dig>  osr <dig> and osr <dig>  but also of those encoding the transcription factors hnf1a, hnf4a and tfe <dig> as well as the signalling molecules wnt11b and gdnf . after fourteen hours we found as a delayed response induction of the transcripts encoding the transcription factor pax <dig> and esterase d . at this later time point decreased level of transcripts encoding the rna binding protein rbms <dig> and the fibroblast growth factor receptor  were found implying secondary effects. as lhx <dig> transcripts are induced by hnf1b, we also tested five transcripts of genes known to be targeted by lhx <dig>  indeed, cerberus  and chordin  were induced, but three other lhx <dig> targets were not . in fact, goosecoid  was downregulated after fourteen hours. taken together, hnf1b can activate in animal caps several genes involved in kidney development, but some genes considered to be hnf1b targets in mammals are not influenced.

hnf1b  injected animal caps were cultured for seven or fourteen hours in steinberg's solution and analysed by quantitative rt-pcr for gene expression of the early nephrogenic transcription factors, of genes involved in nephrogenesis  <cit> , of proximal tubule genes  <cit>  and of the lhx <dig> target genes chrd  <cit> , cer <dig>  <cit> , gsc  <cit> , otx <dig>  <cit>  and pcdh <dig>   <cit>  using the primers given in additional file  <dig>  based on the low sample numbers , genes were defined as induced or repressed, if all induction values were either higher or lower for a given probe. distinct induction or reduction is indicated by an upward or downward arrow, respectively. n is the number of pools with  <dig> animal caps.

hnf1b regulates lhx <dig> transcription by an hnf <dig> binding site in the lhx <dig> promoter
the xenopus lhx <dig> gene is known to be regulated in early embryogenesis by activin a via an activin response element  present in the first intron  <cit> . since our data show that hnf1b induces lhx <dig> transcripts in animal caps without activin treatment, we explored a direct activation of the lhx <dig> gene via hnf1b. by in silico analysis with jaspar  <cit>  we identified potential hnf <dig> binding sites  in the promoter region and the first intron of the xenopus lhx <dig> gene . to determine functional hnf <dig> binding sites, we tested four luciferase reporter constructs carrying various fragments of the lhx <dig> gene . these constructs were transiently transfected into a hek <dig> cell line containing tetracycline-inducible hnf1b  <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, the construct ex-5:b containing the entire lhx <dig> gene was inducible by hnf1b and by analysis of various deletion constructs regulation by hnf1b could be pinned down to the hnf <dig> site of the promoter area  versus ex <dig> in figure 6a). clearly, partial mutation  of the hnf <dig> site of the promoter  abolished hnf1b regulation completely. hnf1b transactivation via the hnf <dig> binding site in the lhx <dig> promoter is about 70%  compared to the effect seen with the hnf4a p <dig> promoter, a well studied hnf1b target  <cit> .

to extend these findings to xenopus embryonic cells we tested some constructs in animal caps that were derived from controls or hnf1b injected eggs. all constructs retaining the hnf <dig> binding site were transactivated by injected hnf1b, including the minimal construct ex <dig>  whereas the reporter ex <dig> containing the partially deleted hnf <dig> site was not inducible . from these results we conclude that the lhx <dig> promoter carries a functional hnf <dig> binding site that is active in hek <dig> cells as well as in embryonic cells of xenopus.

discussion
animal caps are a suitable system to analyse nephrogenesis in vitro, because pronephros differentiation can be induced by treatment with activin a and retinoic acid  <cit> . activin a simulates as a tgf-β family member the vegetalizing factor  <dig>   <cit> . this factor whose maternal mrna is localized to the vegetal pole of xenopus eggs  <cit>  has mesoderm-inducting activity and is an essential regulator of embryonic patterning  <cit> . on the other hand retinoic acid regulates major embryonic growth and patterning decisions and its availability is regulated by synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes  <cit> . in xenopus retinal dehydrogenase  creates a critical retinoic acid concentration gradient along the anteroposterior axis  <cit>  and it was shown that retinoic acid treatment of embryos leads to larger pronephros  <cit> , whereas defective retinoic acid signalling impairs pronephros development  <cit> .

although the animal cap assay represents a powerful system to analyse key molecular events in nephrogenesis, it has some limitations, since pronephros differentiation does not occur in all animal caps. in our hands treated animal caps revealed pronephric induction rate of about 60-85% comparable to about 80% described previously  <cit> . significantly, animal caps often died during the four day incubation and this lethality was increased upon mrna injection, but a clear activation of pronephros differentiation was seen in surviving activin a and retinoic acid treated animal caps. the inhomogeneous response of individual animal caps seen by antibody staining was also observed when comparing the induction of specific transcripts between different experiments . this experimental variation was also evident in transactivation of promoter luciferase reporter constructs , a limitation reported previously  <cit> . in these experiments the variable outcome is possibly further increased, since reporter constructs and mrnas cannot be introduced at exactly the same level into each animal cap. in spite of these technical difficulties, we successfully used the animal caps to identify several transcriptional regulatory pathways in this differentiating system.

our analysis of animal caps treated with activin a and retinoic acid revealed the known induction of lhx <dig>  and pax <dig>  <cit> , but also induced expression of osr <dig>  osr <dig> and hnf1b . interestingly, in animal caps the kinetics of induction reflects the expression in vivo, an observation made for other induced rnas previously  <cit> . thus, the expression of osr <dig>  osr <dig>  lhx <dig> and hnf1b after  <dig>  hours treatment corresponds with their embryonic expression at early gastrula  <cit>  and pax <dig> expressed later in animal caps agrees with its expression in late gastrula  <cit> .

in animal caps activin a can induce osr <dig> and lhx <dig> alone reflecting its strong inducing activity in animal caps  <cit> . in contrast retinoic acid fails to induce any of the five factors  correlating the fact that retinoic acid does not induce pronephros  <cit> . previous experiments showed a low lhx <dig> induction in retinoic acid treated animal caps  <cit>  that possibly reflect subtle differences in the induction protocol or the animals used.

the fast induction of osr <dig>  hnf1b and lhx <dig> reflects most likely a direct activation by activin a and retinoic acid, since the induction of these transcripts was not inhibited by cycloheximide treatment , a finding that has been previously reported for activin a induced lhx <dig> transcripts  <cit> . consistent with such a direct activation an actvin a respose element  has been identified in the lhx <dig> promoter  <cit> .

previous experiments showed that it is possible to induce tissue differentiation by overexpressing transcription factors in animal caps. for instance overexpressed xbra leads to mesoderm differentiation with muscle, mesothelium and mesenchyme  <cit> , whereas sox <dig>  <cit>  or zic <dig>  <cit>  induce neural tissues. in contrast, overexpression of the five nephrogenic transcription factors failed to trigger pronephros differentiation in animal caps . however, as we used only the common pronephric markers 4a <dig> and 3g <dig>  we cannot exclude that some other pronephric differentiation products are induced.

in other experiments the failure of injected transcription factor to induce differentiation in animal caps could be overcome by adding growth factors. for example the induction of neural crest differentiation by pax <dig> and zic <dig> requires wnt signaling  <cit>  or neptune induces erythropoiesis only together with gata <dig> and bfgf  <cit> . concerning pronephros differentiation the ectodermal character of the animal pole cells has possibly first to be changed to a mesodermal fate by adding mesoderm inducing factors. hence, we added activin a to osr <dig> treated animal caps, but without enhancing pronephros differentiation of animal caps . since osr <dig> has essential functions at the beginning of kidney development  <cit>  and the ability to induce the three early nephrogenic transcription factors hnf1b, lhx <dig> and pax <dig> in vivo  <cit> , its inability to induce pronephros differentiation is striking. however, murine cells expressing osr <dig> although multipotent and necessary to build the metanephric precursors require signals from the surrounding tissues for kidney development  <cit> . similarly in zebrafish osr <dig> is required to limit endoderm differentiation to allow kidney development  <cit> . since osr <dig> did not improve the differentiation potential of activin a and retinoic acid treated animal caps , other signalling molecules are missing. in this context it may be relevant that ectopic kidney tissues in osr <dig> , osr <dig>  or lhx <dig> and pax <dig>  <cit>  overexpressing embryos were found exclusively close to the pronephros. this suggests that signals in the region of pronephros anlage are needed. most recently wnt11b has been proposed as such a signal  <cit> .

in our experiments we overexpressed either the human or murine transcription factors in order to distinguish the activity of the endogenous gene from the injected rna, because previous experiments have shown equivalence between xenopus and human hnf1b. this we confirmed in principle for osr <dig> and osr2a  as well as for coinjected lhx <dig> and pax <dig> . however, in contrast to the xenopus factors, human lhx <dig> coinjecetd with pax <dig> cannot induce ectopic pronephric tissue and such subtle differences may limit the use of mammalian factors in xenopus embryos.

investigating the influence of hnf1b on  <dig> potential hnf1b target genes we could show the activation of nine genes in injected animal caps . the induced genes include the transcription factor lhx <dig>  hnf1a, hnf4a and tfe <dig> suggesting the activation of various transcriptional cascades. this assumption is supported by the observation that the lhx <dig> target genes cer <dig>  <cit>  and chrd  <cit> , both with important roles in nephrogenesis, were also induced. since other lhx <dig> target genes were not activated , we assume that some lhx <dig> target genes are inhibited by hnf1b expression. it is striking that cer <dig> is induced at very high levels and peaked off within seven hours indicating a transient activation of cer <dig> by lhx <dig> which itself is only transiently induced by hnf1b . the activation of hnf1a was expected, as hnf1b expression in the xenopus embryos activates hnf1a  <cit>  and the hnf1a promoter contains a functional hnf <dig> site  <cit> . since hnf1b induces the expression of osr <dig> and osr <dig> we deduce a positive feedback loop, as osr <dig> and osr <dig> are able to induce hnf1b  <cit> . furthermore, an increased expression of the signalling molecules wnt11b  <cit>  and gdnf  <cit>  were found, both of which play a role in nephrogenesis. similarly, the downregulation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor  may be relevant, as fgfr4c down-regulation is needed to allow pronephros development  <cit> . the delayed induction of two other important molecules in nephrogenesis, pax <dig>  <cit>  and esd  <cit> , implied an indirect activation. the fact that several genes crucial for pronephros development and expressed later in more differentiated pronephric tissues were not activated in animal caps by hnf1b, may either reflect that hnf1b acts differentially in xenopus compared to mammals or more likely other signals are missing in the undifferentiated animal cap. albeit our data show that hnf1b regulates in embryonic cells many genes potentially essential for pronephros development.

a function of hnf1b in early nephrogenesis has most recently been reported also in mice by tetraploid and diploid embryo complementation to overcome early embryonic lethality of homozygous knock-out mice  <cit> . significantly, in these mice lhx <dig> was shown to be regulated by hnf1b and to contain an hnf <dig> binding site in the far upstream promoter. thus, the regulation of lhx <dig> by hnf1b seems to be evolutionary conserved, as a 10-fold increase in the expression level of lhx <dig> in hnf1b differentiated animal caps is seen  and this induction is mediated by an hnf <dig> binding site in the xenopus lhx <dig> promoter region .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study using animal cap assays we provide insight into the network of the early nephrogenic transcription factors in pronephros development and the genes induced by hnf1b, especially . significantly, we identified a functional hnf <dig> binding site in the lhx <dig> promoter. however, none of the early nephrogenic transcription factors has the ability to induce pronephros differentiation in animal caps.
