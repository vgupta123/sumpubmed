BACKGROUND
canine visceral leishmaniasis  is a worldwide zoonosis prevalent in approximately  <dig> countries in the mediterranean basin, middle east, and south america. in brazil, the parasite leishmania infantum is the cause of cvl, and the sandfly lutzomyia longipalpis is the principal hematophagous vector. high infection rates occur in areas of environmental degradation and human migration associated with urbanization. dogs are the principal reservoir for the parasite, playing a central role in transmission to humans, and present a serious public health concern  <cit> . the main histological alterations observed in dogs with visceral leishmaniasis are hypertrophy and hyperplasia of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system in spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow; a chronic inflammation of the skin; granulomatous inflammatory reactions in liver and spleen; interstitial pneumonitis; and glomerulonephritis with or without nephrotic syndrome. gastrointestinal tract  disorders occur in human visceral leishmaniasis  and in canine natural and experimentally induced infections  <cit> .

git disorders occur in response to cvl as a result of natural infection  <cit>  and experimental infection  <cit> . researchers have described a severe chronic inflammatory process in the mucosa and submucosa, predominantly localized in the lamina propria  of the intestinal mucosa , which is associated with higher levels of parasitism when compared with other git segments. mononuclear exudates are composed of plasma cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes, with few neutrophils and eosinophils. adamama-moraitou et al.  <cit>  described pyogranuloma formation. in a recent study , we investigated  <dig> dogs naturally infected with l. infantum from an endemic metropolitan area of belo horizonte, minas gerais, brazil, and observed high parasite burden throughout the git mucosa  of symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs without marked pathological alterations .

the detection of specific microorganisms by innate immune cells is mediated by pattern recognition receptors , germ line-encoded receptors that recognize microbial structures referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. the potential contribution of toll-like receptors  in fighting parasitic infections has gained attention in the past decade. tlrs are essential prrs that mediate the recognition of microbial structures and induce inflammatory and adaptive responses. several studies have shown the recognition of leishmania-derived molecules by different tlrs  <cit> . during the past decade, it has become clear that a family of non-clonal, germline-encoded prrs, the mammalian tlrs, provides the innate immune system with considerable specificity for a spectrum of microbial pathogens  <cit> . recently, tlrs have been demonstrated to be essential for activation of immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, through the recognition of microbial components including lipopolysaccharide  from gram-negative bacteria, lipoprotheic acid, lipoproteins produced by all bacterial pathogens, and peptidoglycan, the main stimulatory component of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . thirteen mammalian tlrs have been described, with ten expressed in humans, each responsible for the recognition of distinct, invariant microbial structures, not expressed by the host, and known as pathogen associated molecular patterns   <cit> .

the effector site in the intestine is the mucosal epithelium that underlies the lp in the small and large intestines. homeostasis in the gut seems to be a result of precise interaction among activated t cells, plasma cells, mast cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, characterizing a state of physiological inflammation. however, microbiota and dietary antigens are continuously absorbed, reaching the lp, peyer´s patches, and isolated lymphoid follicles in the mucosal layer of the intestine as well as the mesenteric lymph nodes. this gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue  constitutes the largest and most complex immunologic organ of the body and must be capable of mounting protective immune responses to pathogens while maintaining tolerance to harmless environmental antigens such as food and commensal microbes  <cit> .

the git consists of the small intestine , and the large intestine . as with other cells of the vertebrate body, intestinal cells can express all tlr types. normally, intestinal epithelium is not inflamed despite close contact with a high density of commensal organisms that could elicit inflammation  <cit> . the differential expression of tlrs in distinct anatomical compartments of the gut epithelium of the git is likely to contribute to avoiding over-stimulation  <cit> .

several non-tlr chains cooperate with tlrs to recognize pamps. cd <dig> and the integrin-like cd11b/cd <dig> receptors  are examples of such receptors  <cit> . in a previous study conducted by our group, peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected dogs were evaluated using surface receptors including cd <dig>  cd11b, tlr <dig>  and mhcii. dogs bearing cd <dig> monocytes with higher expression of cd11b had a lower parasite load in ear tissue. these parasites were unable to infect phlebotomines . conversely, dogs with lower expression of cd11b in cd <dig> monocytes had higher parasite load in the ear tissue, and these parasites were able to infect phlebotomines . higher values of cd11b+/tlr2+ and cd11b+/mhcii+ were obtained from dogs with ihq-/xeno- than dogs with ihq+/xeno+. these data lead to the conclusion that ihq-/xeno- dogs are either more resistant to infection or better able to mount a cellular immune response essential for leishmania tissue clearance  <cit> . recent data also demonstrated that tlr <dig> plays a role in the recognition of leishmania <cit> , although several questions concerning the role of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in l. infantum infection of the canine git remain to be answered, considering that the git microflora has a marked gradient and plays an important role in maintenance and regulation of gut immunity. since tlr recognition is often associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and with the generation of additional effector molecules, it is important to determine the implications of tlr activation during leishmania infection. a few leishmania-derived molecules have been reported to activate tlrs, and the majority of the studies to date have focused on the activation of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  thus the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between parasite load and expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> by lp myeloid cells of the jejunum and colon co-expressing cd11b, cd11c, and cd <dig> receptors.

RESULTS
clinical examinations
physical evaluation of all animals  was carried out before necropsy. all dogs exhibiting external clinical signs presented with dermatological symptoms. a single symptomatic animal was observed to experience pain on abdomen palpation. the clinical lesions observed in symptomatic dogs were: superficial cervical  and popliteal  lymph node enlargement; nasal hyperceratosis ; ocular congestion ; onychogryphosis ; cachexia ; dry seborrhea ; alopecia ; vasculitis of the tail ; and ulcerated lesions, mainly in the extremity of the ear  . this study considered dogs that presented at least one classical clinical sign of disease to be symptomatic. all symptomatic dogs exhibited more than one clinical sign of visceral disease. animals were considered asymptomatic if they showed no clinical sign of leishmaniasis. during necropsy, no severe macroscopic or microscopic lesion in the mucosa of the git was evident. in approximately 25% of the dogs, the mucosa was hyperemic; although no other severe macroscopic or microscopic alteration was found .

histological analysis
an increase of cellularity of lp was evident in all samples of infected dogs than controls. the presence of mononuclear cells was more frequent in the mucosal and submucosal layers of jejunum and colon tissue fragments of infected dogs than controls, regardless of their clinical status. histological analysis revealed higher levels of cellularity  in the lp of jejunum and colon in infected dogs than in control dogs. macrophages frequently presented with atypical morphology characterized by pale and abundant cytoplasm and a less dense nucleus than is typically seen. this was associated with areas of concentrations of mononuclear cells, but no typical granulomatous reaction was evident in the lp. a small number of neutrophils and eosinophils were observed associated with a diffuse mononuclear lp cellularity.

morphometric analysis of lp cells in jejunum and colon tissue of infected dogs demonstrated no significant difference between jejunum and colon. there were no significant differences in lp cellularity of infected asymptomatic versus symptomatic dogs. in liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of infected dogs, a pattern of injury was found similar to that described by tafuri et al.  <cit> . in liver, the most frequent alterations were granulomatous inflammation, hydropic and adipose degeneration, and hemosiderosis. hemorrhage, plasmacytosis, congestion, and capsule inflammation were observed in spleen. lymph nodes showed plasmacytosis and subcapsular and cortical follicle hyperplasia. leishmania amastigotes were seen in these organs.

amastigotes of leishmania were present in all git layers, particularly inside macrophages of the lp. despite the parasite load, no erosion or ulcers were evident in the epithelial mucosa layers or the glands, and morphometric analysis of the parasite burden of canine jejunum demonstrate a significant difference from that of the colon, with the colon harboring more parasites than the jejunum . no difference was observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. a positive correlation of inflammatory cells with parasite load was observed in jejunum  and colon .

semi-quantitative histological analysis of all samples of jejunum and colon was conducted by optical microscopy. frequency of histological changes in jejunum and colon were hemorrhage , congestion , macrophage hyperplasia , plasmocytosis  and high levels of mononuclear cellularity  .

myeloid cell expression of cd11b, cd <dig>  cd11c, tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> in the mucosa of the colon and jejunum
lamina propria cells from colon and jejunum were analyzed by flow cytometry. myeloid cells were identified based on specific forward  and side  light-scattering properties , and expression of receptors was assessed using monoclonal antibodies and isotype controls . a higher frequency of tlr2+ cells was demonstrated in colon compared to jejunum  . in contrast, a numbers of tlr9+ cells were evident in jejunum  . there was no difference in frequency of colon and jejunum cells expressing cd <dig> . cd11c+ cells were elevated in colon  , whereas cd11b+ cells and cd11b+/cd14+ cells predominated in jejunum  . frequency of cd11b+ cells and cd11b+/cd14+ cells expressing tlr <dig> was elevated in jejunum than colon . jejunum and colon segments of symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs showed no significant differences in the frequency of studied receptors, with the exception of a cd14+ subset which was present at higher levels in symptomatic dogs . a positive correlation between inflammatory cells and parasite load was observed in jejunum  and colon . there was a low positive correlation between parasitism and receptors studied, with an average r2 =  <dig>  in jejunum and r2 =  <dig>  in colon. a higher frequency these receptors were demonstrated in infected dogs compared to control dogs.

cytokines
despite the negative elisa serum results for interleukin  <dig> , interleukin  <dig>  and tumoral necrotic factor-alpha  cytokines were detected in jejunum and colon tissue samples from all infected animals. il- <dig> and tnf-α were higher in jejunum than in colon of infected animals . il- <dig> was higher in colon than jejunum of infected animals  . a higher expression these cytokines were demonstrated in infected dogs compared to uninfected dogs.

discussion
histological analysis of all segments of git of infected dogs revealed intense cellularity in the lp of the mucosal layer. these cells were represented by plasma cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. macrophages were hypertrophic and frequently infected by amastigotes of leishmania. morphometric analysis of the lp cellularity demonstrated comparable numbers of cells in the jejunum and colon, but the parasite load was higher in colon. despite the parasite burden throughout the git mucosa, no ulcer, focus of hemorrhage, or marked pathological alterations were observed. these results are in accordance with silva et al.  <cit>  and pinto et al.  <cit> . however, adamama-moraitou et al.  <cit> , using colonoscopy, and immunohistochemistry observed mild erosive colonic mucosa in eight of  <dig> symptomatic dogs naturally infected with l. infantum. the dogs included in their study did not present a history or clinical evidence of overt colitis. these authors found pyogranulomatous formation to be the most common histological feature in the colonic mucosa. it has been suggested that the granulomatous inflammatory reaction is directly related to a low parasite tissue burden  <cit> . in the current study, immunohistochemical morphometric analysis showed a higher parasite load in colon than in jejunum, which is in accordance with the literature  <cit> . a positive correlation between parasite load and cellularity in the lp was evident .

the presence of excessive cellular infiltrate in the lp has been associated with microflora; parasite load of biological agents including viruses, fungi and protozoa; and the immunologic status of the host. gastrointestinal mucosa is home to the largest number of leukocytes in the body, and is the site where these cells encounter abundant exogenous stimuli. despite this constant immunological stimulation, immune responses in the intestine remain in a state of controlled inflammation: the physiological inflammatory status  <cit> . emerging evidence indicates that tlrs are involved in the immunological homeostasis of git. crypt epithelial cells express tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  whereas a mature intestinal epithelial cell  expresses only tlr <dig>  <cit> . since crypt epithelial cells do not come into direct contact with commensal bacteria, expression of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> should not be detrimental to the host. tlr <dig> expression in the intestinal lumen is also not damaging, since the tlr <dig> ligand, viral double-stranded rna, is not naturally present in the gut microbiota. inflammation associated with the expression of tlr <dig> by iec is minimized, since this receptor is unresponsive to cpg due to the presence in the gut mucosa of tlr-antagonists that can suppress the activation of tlr <dig>  <cit> . in addition, resident macrophages in intestinal lp seem to play an important role in git mucosa homeostasis. resident macrophages of the jejunum and colon are located in the lp just below the mucosal layer  <cit>  and are present in the sub-epithelial dome region of peyer´s patches. recent studies have demonstrated that human colonic macrophages express the human macrophage marker, macrosialin , low levels of the integrins cd11b  and cd11c , and mhc class ii antigens  <cit> . intestinal macrophages lack cd <dig> receptors, a glycosilphosphatidyl inositol -linked glycoprotein that forms part of the high affinity complex essential for lps recognition expression. intestinal macrophages differ from their peripheral counterparts, as they originate from circulating monocytes that express a range of functional tlrs, integrins cd11a, b, c/cd <dig>  and cd <dig> positive receptors  <cit> . therefore, it appears that intestinal macrophages down-regulate tlrs upon arrival in the mucosa, although the underlying mechanism is unknown  <cit> .

canine tlr <dig> has been sequenced, with moderate expression of tlr <dig> mrna detected in the small and large intestine  <cit> , but no tlr <dig> mrna was detected using conventional pcr  <cit> . however, burgener et al.  <cit> , using rt-pcr, detected mrna coding for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in the duodenum and colon of dogs with git chronic disorders. these authors found higher tlr <dig> expression in the duodenum than the in the colon. they also described tlr <dig> expression in all segments of git, with a significantly higher expression in ileum than in stomach, jejunum, or colon. in our study of dogs naturally infected with leishmania, we found lower frequencies of tlr2+ cells and higher frequencies of tlr9+ cells in jejunum than in colon.

little information is available on tlrs in the canine intestine, although it is known that tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are expressed at low levels in non-stimulated canine primary colon epithelial cells and can be upregulated in response to challenge by their respective agonists, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . upregulation of tlrs in canine macrophages obtained from the lp of jejunum and colon could be explained either by recruitment of inflammatory cells expressing tlrs or by proliferation of resident macrophages induced by leishmania antigens. leishmania reaches intestinal lp via blood or lymphatic vessels, and tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> on the macrophage surface can interact with leishmania <cit> . de veer et al.  <cit>  showed that tlr <dig> activates nf-κb mediated by lpg. unlike tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> appears to be intracellular, but it can be upregulated and expressed on the cell surface, where it can participate in cellular activation and lead to inflammation or tolerance in mice. in humans, tlr <dig> has been implicated in nk cell activation being essential for il- <dig> production by dendritic cells  <cit> . in equines, an enhancing effect of tlr <dig> ligation to antigen-specific th <dig> immune responses to intracellular pathogens has been described by zhang et al.  <cit> . similar results were observed in dogs with git disorders  <cit> . we found an association between a lower parasite burden in the jejunum and a higher frequency of tlr9+ cells, suggesting tlr <dig> correlation with parasite clearance. on the other hand, tlr <dig> has been described as associated with tgf-beta production and regulatory function, rather than inflammatory activity of macrophages  <cit> . tlr2+ cells were more abundant in colonic tissue of infected dogs. vivarini et al.   <cit>  suggest that tlr <dig> plays a role in facilitating the establishment of the disease, depending on the leishmania species involved.

we found a correlation between higher frequencies of cd11b+ and cd14+ macrophages expressing tlr <dig> in the jejunum as compared to colon in infected dogs. in canine visceral leishmaniasis, peripheral monocytes tlr2+/cd11b+/cd14+ <cit>  and hepatic macrophages cd11b+/cd18+ <cit>  seem to be associated with lower tissue parasite load. in contrast, splenic macrophages splenic cells  might serve to perpetuate the intracellular infection  <cit> . thus, as reported in the literature, there is a compartmentalization of the immune response against leishmania in different organs  <cit> . according to ettinger and wilson  <cit> , the initial encounter between l. infantum and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems stimulates primarily type  <dig> immune cytokine responses . cd11b and cd <dig> are important macrophage receptors involved in this initial interaction and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . however, resident intestine macrophages do not express cd11b and cd <dig> antigens in healthy git. therefore, the presence of leishmania in lp could modify the lp environmental homeostasis, generating mediators responsible for chemotaxis of circulating monocytes to the mucosa. these recently recruited monocytes may not remain in the location for a period of time sufficient for adaptive differentiation to occur, or it may be that leishmania presence heightens the level of immune-stimulatory signals, overcoming the usual regulatory processes  <cit> . parasitic infections can also provide stimulation for the expression of tlr <dig> by the macrophages, as reported in dogs with chronic inflammatory disorders  <cit> . therefore, the correlation between the frequencies of cd11b+/cd14+ cell expressing tlr <dig> in the jejunum with the lower parasite load at this site suggests that tlr <dig> may play an effective role in inducing a cellular immune response against leishmania in macrophages. tlr <dig> stimulation could lead to protective immunity against the parasite. however, results should be interpreted with caution; more research needs to be done to correlate tlr expression with a potential role for those receptors in generating responses in leishmaniasis. increased expression of tlr <dig> in colon and tlr <dig> in jejunum may occur as a consequence of the inflammatory environment of the git, making it difficult to evaluate the extent to which leishmania is implicated in the activation of tlrs.

infected dogs showed higher il- <dig>  il- <dig> e tnf-α levels than controls, regardless of clinical status. however, tnf- α and il- <dig> was higher in jejunum, with a lower parasite load, than in colon. in contrast, il- <dig> was higher in colon than jejunum. tnf- α has been implicated as an anti-leishmania proliferation cytokine, with il- <dig> and il- <dig> being related to the susceptibility to visceral disease. thus, our results for tnf- α and il- <dig> are in accordance with the literature regarding their role in canine visceral leishmaniasis. however, the higher level of il- <dig> found in jejunum could be a conflicting result, if we consider il- <dig> a cytokine related to the progression of disease. higher levels of il- <dig> in jejunum than colon associated with a lower parasite load may be explained by tnf- α ability to induce t cells and regulatory t cells responsible for il- <dig> production .

CONCLUSIONS
there was no correlation between clinical signs and pathological changes and immunological and parasitological findings in the gastrointestinal tract in canine visceral leishmaniasis. however, distinct segments of git presented different immunological and parasitological responses. jejunum showed a lower parasite load with increased frequency and expression of cd11b, tlr <dig>  cd14/cd11b/tlr <dig> receptors and il- <dig> and tnf-α cytokines. conversely, the colon showed a higher parasite load along with increased frequency and expression of tlr <dig>  cd11c receptors, and il- <dig> cytokine. thus, leishmania infantum is able to interfere in jejunum increased expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd11b, cd <dig>  cd14/cd11b/tlr <dig> receptors, il- <dig>  and tnf-α; and in colon increased expression of cd11c, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  cd11b, cd <dig> e, cd14/cd11b/tlr <dig> receptors, il- <dig>  and tnf-α.
