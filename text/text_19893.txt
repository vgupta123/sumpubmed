BACKGROUND
oaks  are important trees of the northern hemisphere. in europe they form highly valuable widespread forests. together with chestnut and beech, oaks belong to the fagaceae, and are probably the best-known genus of the family. the evergreen cork oak  grows in the western mediterranean basin, having as natural range algeria, france, italy, morocco, portugal, spain and tunisia, where it is managed under low-density anthropogenic open woodland forests. quercus spp. are important for conservation of soil and water, biodiversity, natural landscape and climate, and for production of highly valuable materials, thus having high ecological, social and economic value.

quercus suber shares with phellodendron amurense  and q. variabilis  the odd ability of producing a continuous and renewable out-bark of cork, although only q. suber cork has the fine physical and chemical properties for a highly profitable industrial use.

portugal owns the credits of the world leading position on cork oak forest area , cork production , and cork processing . in portugal, in the past, oaks used to dominate the native forests but their area has rapidly decreased as a result of human activity. still, cork oak forests are accounting for about 26% of the portuguese forest  <cit> .

however, cork oak  and holm oak  decline reported in the iberian peninsula over the last  <dig> years has caused death of numerous trees, threatening the rural economy in this part of europe . it has been predicted that oak diseases in europe could become more severe and expand to the north and east within the next few hundred years  <cit> .

nowadays, this species faces many other threats, such as drought, extreme temperature and pests, leading to a marked decline of cork oak stands, possibly related to the repeated successions of extremely dry and hot years with a significant reduction of springtime precipitation  <cit> .

the relevance of q. suber and the scarce information available on its genetics, biochemistry and physiology  fully justifies the generation of transcriptomics data that will allow a new insight on cork oak biology and genetics. these data are fundamental for designing selection programs and understanding the plant adaptation processes to both biotic and abiotic factors, plant’s plasticity, ecophysiological interactions, interspecific hybridization and gene flow.

for a species that has neither its genome sequenced, nor a physical map available, the information obtained from expressed sequence tags  is a practical means for gene discovery and a way to start elucidating its physiology and functional genome. when this project started  there were less than  <dig> ests available for q. suber. recently, this number has increased to almost  <dig>  .

other oak species have also been subjected to transcriptomic studies, namely two european white oak species   <cit> , two american oak species  . ueno et al.  <cit>  generated  <dig>  non-redundant sequences  from multiple cdna libraries prepared from q. petraea and q. robur, which is a relevant resource for genomic studies and identification of genes of adaptive significance. in  <dig>  the same team produced another useful tool, a bac library, for genome analysis in q. robur <cit> . another important tool to develop a physical map for a fagaceae species was based on the work of durand and co-workers  <cit> , who produced a total of  <dig> oak est-ssrs that were assigned to bins and their map position was further validated by linkage mapping . more recently,  <cit>  generated the larger-to-date set of reads from the transcriptome of an oak species , combining  <dig> and illumina sequencing.

within a national initiative, portugal organized a consortium to study cork oak ests , where  <dig> projects were designed to obtain a deeper understanding of q. suber functional genomics. developmental aspects , as well as cork formation and quality, and abiotic  and biotic interactions  were followed by  <dig> teams from all over the country. two of these projects were fully dedicated to the bio-informatics analysis of the generated data and development of bioinformatics platforms, one of them further focusing on polymorphism detection and validation.

this paper presents the experiments conducted for large-scale sequencing of  <dig> cdna libraries and construction of a cork oak transcriptome database containing  <dig>  unigenes. presently, this database constitutes one of the largest genomic resources available for oaks and was structured to accommodate future data on genomics and physiology of woody species. the tools that were generated are crucial to study cork oak biology and diversity, and to understand gene regulation and adaptation to a changing environment. future developments will make possible the early detection of traits of interest. this initiative will contribute to genomic research in cork oak and the fagaceae family, paving the way for further studies.

RESULTS
sequencing
we have constructed  <dig> libraries from q. suber as described in table  <dig>  the libraries were constructed from total rna extracted from multiple tissues, developmental stages and stress conditions. libraries were normalized by the duplex-specific nuclease-technology  <cit> , with the aim of increasing gene-space coverage and sequenced in a  <dig> gs-flx with titanium chemistry . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were produced, ranging from  <dig> to 587 bp, with an average length ranging between  <dig> and 310 bp . an initial pre-processing step to remove contaminants, low quality sequences and short sequences resulted in a reduction to nearly  <dig> million nuclear reads , with average lengths ranging between  <dig> and 321 bp . our approach resulted in a higher number and comparable read length as compared to other multi-library projects .table  <dig> tissues and conditions used to produce the rna libraries

assembly
a stringent assembly pipeline was implemented and is summarized in figure  <dig>  the assembly methodology is described in the materials and methods section, consisting of two stages: first each library was assembled individually, and secondly all assembled libraries were further assembled . the choice of this two-step protocol lied in the asynchronous nature of the libraries being sequenced, and the need to deal with future libraries that are expected to be generated for other conditions and stress types. the choice of parameters in our protocol maximized the number of contigs and their length , was extensively validated, and is described in greater detail in a companion paper . we opted for de novo assembly, as the lack of a closely related species with a completely sequenced genome resulted in poor assembly . the assembly statistics for each library are shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  putative unigenes was achieved, including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets. each library produced from  <dig>  up to  <dig>  putative unigenes. these were all subjected to one additional assembly step , which reduced the number of putative unigenes to approximately  <dig>  unigenes. the final unigene length distribution is shown in figure 2a. an average unigene length of  <dig>  bp was found, which is smaller than those obtained in another oak using a combination the same sequencing platform with sanger sequencing  <cit>  . a blastp of all the unigenes the nr database finds plant best hits in  <dig> % of the cases, with the remaining being hits to other species that are likely contaminations not removed by our pipeline. a plot with the species distribution of these non-plant species is found on corkoakdb.org.figure  <dig>

coverage and depth
the large number of libraries used, together with the choice of a two-step assembly, resulted in a high redundancy. most of the nearly  <dig> million filtered ests were assembled into a large number of unigenes . we obtained an average coverage depth of  <dig>  , with a maximum depth of  <dig> . this is higher than other recent tree est projects using the same sequencing platform , likely due to the extensive number of libraries sequenced in this project, prepared from multiple tissues, developmental stages and stress conditions. after the two rounds of assembly,  <dig>  high quality reads remained unassembled and were treated as singletons. thus, 65% of our unigenes derive from contigs, higher than other recent comparable projects .

in the absence of a complete genome sequence, it is impossible to know the true coverage of the cork oak gene space offered by this project. however, when we queried the proteomes of arabidopsis thaliana and populus trichocarpa using blastp to determine the potential number of unique genes detected, using a cut off of e < 10- <dig>  we found that 65% of cork oak unigenes hit  <dig>  out of  <dig>  predicted proteins in a. thaliana , and  <dig>  out of  <dig>  in p. trichocarpa   <cit> . these numbers represent a rough estimate of the upper  and lower  boundaries one can expect from the q. suber transcriptome coverage. this figure doesn’t change significantly if we use a more lenient cut off of e < 10- <dig>  where we hit  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. a high degree of redundancy in our unigenes is suggested, as multiple unigenes hit the same target genes in either species. the remaining  <dig>  unigenes cannot find any hit in either a. thaliana or p. trichocarpa, representing about 35% of the cork oak transcriptome. these include small unigenes that would not achieve significance in blastp comparisons , as well as potential novel genes not present in these two genomes. this number could be eventually overestimated, if we consider some under-assembly in our libraries.

we performed a serial clustering at increasing levels of identity in order to evaluate the degree of redundancy in our assembly . we found that at the protein level, there was a sharp decrease in the number of clusters at 95% identity, indicating that approximately  <dig> predicted peptides show a high identity between each other, comparable to that found in other oak species  <cit> . this could indicate a recent event of polyploidization giving rise to many highly similar genes. alternatively, and probably most likely, this could be accounted by the high genetic diversity among the multiple unrelated trees used to prepare the libraries  <cit> . sequencing errors not fully resolved due to the relatively low coverage of many unigenes could also be responsible for this result. in the first scenario our decision to filter off redundancies at the cdna level at 98% could have been excessive, leading to the underestimation of the predicted number of unigenes. in contrast, the second and third scenarios would suggest that 95% is insufficient and we are overestimating the number of unigenes that may be closer to  <dig> . we do not have enough data to favour any of these scenarios, in particular because all three may co-exist. we have thus chosen the 98% cdna clustering as a conservative parameter that we hope does not over-cluster paralogues. with future data accumulation, it will be easier to fuse unigenes than to resolve incorrectly clustered paralogues.

functional annotation
we mapped the cork oak unigenes to the functional classes defined in gene ontology   <cit> . we had  <dig>  sequences mapped to at least one go term and the unigenes covered a total of  <dig>  different go terms. each unigene mapped to  <dig>  terms on average. the vast majority of terms is present at low frequency, with a few functional classes dominating. the biological process “metabolism” was the most frequent, with other metabolic categories in the top five categories - metabolism related categories cover 68% of the terms assigned . consistently, enzyme functions dominate the molecular functions  . these are in contrast with the combined ests of two other oaks, q. petraea and q. robur, where the classes transport  and nucleotide binding  dominate  <cit> . note, however, that this difference may simply lie in the fact that in that study non-normalized libraries were used, resulting in under-representation of lowly expressed genes. furthermore, this difference may also lie in the fact that in that study, nuclear and organelle transcriptomes were, to the best of our knowledge, assembled together, while we removed both chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences from our assembly. this is supported by the observation that in the go cellular component classification, the “plastid” class is the most frequent in the q. petraea/q. robur ests, while in the cork oak, intracellular classes dominate  .figure  <dig>

we used a simple and conservative scheme for gene naming of the cork oak unigenes. besides its accession number , we gave it an unigene name based on its similarity to proteins in a. thaliana and p. trichocarpa . we observed that for nearly 40% of the unigenes we could not assign a clear annotation at cut off of e < 10- <dig> , consistent with the number of unigenes that are not similar to any gene in other model plants. conversely, we could identify conserved domains in 44% of the unigenes, and could establish clear homology relationships to an additional 16% of the unigenes, in a total of 60% unigenes with clear functional assignments in go.table  <dig> unigene naming criteria are as follows

blastp search
if a gene is bi-directional best hit  of x in a. thaliana , we term it ortholog of x; if it is similar to x in a. thaliana  using blastp and it aligns in 85% of its length with more than 35% identity, we term it a high confidence x in q. suber, etc.

we were able to map interpro domains to  <dig>  unigenes . nearly half of the domains were widespread in evolution, being present in both eukaryota and bacteria . the other half was dominated by general eukaryotic domains and less than 10% of the domains were plant specific. these results are comparable to those reported for the complete genomes of a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and p. persica genomes, as well as to those of the transcriptomes of the closely related quercus robur and castanea mollissima which are also depicted in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

evolution
we compared the gene content of the cork oak, as estimated by our est sequencing project, with that of  <dig> completely sequenced plant genomes. we used blastp at e < 10- <dig> and also at the permissive cut off of e < 10- <dig> to determine how many predicted proteins in those species are similar to at least one cork oak unigene. the results of this analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  indicating a broad concordance with the generic taxonomic/evolutionary distance of the species. this result does not change when we use a more permissive cut off of e < 10- <dig> .figure  <dig>

we compared the unigenes derived from the cork oak with those of the red oak , the pedunculate oak  and the chinese chestnut . for this comparison, the data from the fagaceae genome web was used, for q. rubra and c. mollissima which include multiple tissues also sequenced using the  <dig> pyrosequencing platform , and the data for q. robur, which included  <dig> and illumina generated sequences, and was obtained from http://www.ufz.de/trophinoak/index.php?de= <dig> <cit> . we used our own assembly pipeline on these sequences to ensure that no additional differences were introduced on methodological grounds. the comparison is shown in figure  <dig>  the total number of distinct unigenes is higher in the cork oak project, probably reflecting the higher number of tissues and conditions sampled in our libraries, as well as incomplete assembly due to library biases and genetic heterogeneity of the samples. we verified that between 77% and 82% of the unigenes from those species are similar to at least one unigene in the cork oak, as expected from evolutionarily close species. the remaining 18% - 23% of the unigenes of the red and english oaks and chestnut tree are likely species-specific, but may also be partially accounted by an incomplete coverage of the q. suber. the large number of cork oak unigenes that does not find a hit in the other transcriptomes  does however suggest that, most likely, this is not a major factor. this cork-oak-specific set represents a mixture of small reads that fail to attain statistical significance , as well as a putative set of cork oak-specific genes. note that when we compare q. suber with a completely sequenced genome of the prunus persica, 94% of the p. persica genes find a hit in q. suber, further suggesting that incomplete coverage of the gene space was probably not a major problem of our project.figure  <dig>

database and interface
to support the assembly and annotation pipeline we have a data warehouse system that records the data and metadata associated with each step of the pipeline. this is described in a companion paper . from this warehouse we generated a public portal as a community resource for cork oak genomics, which is found at http://www.corkoakdb.org. the assembled genes, the proteins they encode, and the functional annotations are made accessible through a web interface, partially shown in figure  <dig>  the gene view features sequence data, cdna and protein, as well as plots of base-by-base coverage information for the unigene. users are shown pre-computed phylogenetic profiles against other plants according to two distinct methods, the bi-directional best blast hit and the inparanoid, two standard methods to identify orthologs and paralogues  <cit> . the gene view further includes functional annotations, namely go annotations, interpro domain assignments, kegg pathways and best blast hits against general and plant-specific databases. genes of interest can be discovered by searching specific fields or by running a nucleotide or protein blast search against the cork oak database.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed the first large-scale library for the cork oak, an important economic resource in southern europe and north of africa. we carried out a preliminary analysis of its gene content and functional annotation, and built a public platform for data sharing. nineteen different libraries were sequenced, covering genes expressed in multiple tissues, developmental stages and stress conditions. our results suggest that we covered a large fraction of the cork oak gene space. many of its unigenes are dissimilar to any other plant genes. these likely represent incomplete assemblies due to library biases, but may also include several true cork-oak specific genes, which once identified will represent a promising avenue to understand the molecular basis of the response leading to cork formation. we believe that this sequencing effort will enable the community to explore the molecular basis of the cork oak physiology, as well as its responses to the multiple abiotic and biotic challenges that the cork oak forest is currently experiencing.
