BACKGROUND

fusarium oxysporum is a soil-borne fungal pathogen capable of causing widespread destructive losses on over  <dig> different plant species. specialised pathogenic strains of this root-infecting fungus are classified into host-specific sub-species known as formae speciales   based on the host species they cause disease on, and are responsible for the disease known as fusarium or vascular wilt . the spores of this pathogen can survive in soil for decades, thus it is particularly difficult to eradicate following soil contamination  <cit> . important agronomical crops which are affected by fusarium wilt include cotton , horticultural crops such as bananas , cucurbits/melons , strawberries , lettuce  and tomatoes , and many grain and pasture legume species such as chickpea , common bean , field pea , lentil  and lucerne/alfalfa  .

it was proposed for some isolates of a f. oxysporum f. sp. that their ability to cause disease on specific hosts arose through descent from a monophyletic origin. however, for others it was proposed their genetic heterogeneity was polyphyletic in origin and for several this has now been experimentally demonstrated . comparative genomic studies across fusaria identified ‘core’ chromosomes containing genes required for vegetative growth and metabolism, and ‘non-core’ chromosomes  and gene content geared towards pathogenicity  <cit> . the latter, also referred to as lineage-specific, accessory or conditionally dispensable chromosomes , lack house-keeping genes and are poorly conserved across other fusaria or other fungi, but may show higher levels of disparate conservation amongst specific f. oxysporum ff. spp.  <cit> . in a series of elegant experiments, it was demonstrated that the small cdc  <dig>  and parts of other cdcs from some f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici  isolates  could be horizontally transferred to other isolates, enabling the transfer of pathogenicity  <cit> . conversely, a loss of pathogenicity or virulence can also result from the loss of all or parts of fol chr <dig> . the small fol- <dig> cdc  <dig> is referred to as the fol ‘pathogenicity’ chromosome as it contains the majority of known fol in planta expressed effectors, some of which have been shown to interfere with the host’s resistance response and/or are required for virulence  <cit> .

the cd chromosomes or scaffolds of f. oxysporum ff. spp. analysed in some detail to date  are enriched in repetitive elements with cdc encoded transposable elements  accounting for nearly 75 % of all tes in the fol- <dig> genome  <cit> . while only 20 % of fol- <dig> genes on these chromosomes can currently be functionally classified based on the presence of conserved domains, they are enriched for genes related to pathogenicity such as known and putative effectors, fungal transcription factors and genes with roles in signal transduction and secondary metabolism  <cit> . similarly, over half of the predicted proteins from the legume-infecting ff. spp. medicaginis , ciceris  or pisi  genome assemblies assigned to predicted dispensable scaffolds are unclassified proteins with no known function and those that could be assigned functional annotations grouped into similar categories as those enriched on fol cdcs  <cit> .


f. oxysporum is one of the major pathogens of legumes, particularly chickpea, the second most important global grain legume crop . typical annual yield losses due to pathogenic isolates of this host, f. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris, are upwards of 10 % but under favourable disease conditions yield loss can reach 100 % . with the majority of the world’s chickpea production originating from one country  , disease outbreaks and a lack of control mechanisms can have severe impact on global chickpea supplies. various sources of host resistance in chickpeas and other legumes have been identified, but the underlying genetic or molecular mechanisms  are yet to be fully elucidated  <cit> . parallel to this, genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for individual f. oxysporum f. sp. pathogenicity on legumes is poorly understood. towards the aim of transferring knowledge to complex legume species, pathosystems utilising the reference legume medicago truncatula have been developed to dissect the interaction between f. oxysporum and legume hosts . utilising the pathogenic f. oxysporum f. sp. medicaginis strain fom-5190a  isolated from alfalfa  we developed a robust medicago-f. oxysporum pathosystem and identified a resistant and highly susceptible accession  <cit> . these are the reference m. truncatula accession a <dig>  and the accession dza <dig> .

comparative genomics of a comprehensive draft fom genome assembly against the genome assemblies of legume-infecting and other host pathogenic f. oxysporum ff. spp. as well as other fusarium spp. and fungal plant pathogens, identified pathogenicity related gene content possibly geared towards legume host-specificity  <cit> . this information coupled with rna-seq data from an early time-point during infection of the susceptible m. truncatula accession , facilitated the shortlisting of a set of  <dig> fom key effector candidates. herein, we set out to expand on this analysis and identify potential differences in the expressed pathogenicity profile of fom during early infection of susceptible dza <dig> versus resistant a <dig> m. truncatula hosts. one of the limiting factors in early detection of fungal transcripts in root colonised tissues is their poor relative abundance compared to host transcripts and to overcome this, high coverage sequencing or specific sequence capture of fungal transcripts is necessary. we overcame this constraint by conducting high coverage rna-seq and herein present one of the most comprehensive early in planta expressed f. oxysporum transcriptomes, and the first for a legume infecting formae speciales to our knowledge. our rna-seq involved analysis of root samples collected at the early time-point of 48 h after infection and at a later time-point of 7 days when disease symptoms were starting to manifest in the susceptible plants. at the early time-point, although the degree of root colonisation between resistant and susceptible plants was alike, the number, level of induction, and composition of in planta expressed fom genes was higher and more diverse in the susceptible interaction. by 7 days post inoculation a significant increase in colonisation of susceptible plants was evident coupled with increased expression of genes predicted as effectors or associated with protein, sugar and plant cell wall breakdown, membrane transport and nutrient uptake. we discuss these differences and the discovery of new candidate f. oxysporum effectors.

RESULTS
quantification of fusarium growth in resistant and susceptible m. truncatula accessions
we previously identified the reference m. truncatula accession a <dig> to display moderate to strong resistance to fom  <cit>  whilst the dza <dig> accession was susceptible  <cit> . to examine differences in disease progression between these two hosts we infected both alongside each other and quantified fom growth in root and shoot tissues over an infection time-course . within 14 days post inoculation  97 % of dza <dig> plants had visible disease symptoms of wilting, and chlorotic or necrotic leaves, while only 30 % of a <dig> plants were diseased and of these, only 6 % of their leaves on average had visible disease symptoms . by  <dig> dpi all a <dig> plants survived, although the number of diseased plants had risen to 40 %, these again displayed limited symptoms . in contrast, all dza <dig> plants were dead by  <dig> dpi . at  <dig> dpi the fom inoculated a <dig> seedlings were visibly smaller than mock or control inoculated seedlings, showing a 30 % reduction in shoot fresh weight . the limited disease progression observed in a <dig> suggests fom is able to colonise a <dig> seedlings but that the molecular resistance mechanisms employed by a <dig> plants to control pathogen spread results in reduced growth.fig.  <dig> disease symptoms and fom colonisation of resistant and susceptible m. truncatula accessions. a-d disease symptoms of fom inoculated a <dig> and dza <dig> m. truncatula seedlings. a percentage of diseased seedlings at  <dig>   <dig> and 21 days post inoculation  with b) an image of representative seedlings at  <dig> dpi. white arrows highlight disease symptoms of wilting, chlorotic and necrotic leaves. c average survival and d above ground fresh weight of mock  or fom inoculated seedlings at  <dig> dpi. for a, c and d values are averages ± se . similar results were obtained in independent experiments. e relative fom fungal abundance determined by qrt-pcr analysis of fom_18s relative to m. truncatula_18s in samples harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. samples are averages ± se of  <dig> biological replicates consisting of pools of  <dig> seedlings. asterisks indicate values that are significantly different  between a <dig> and dza <dig> at the respective time point




to determine the extent of fom colonisation in a <dig> and compare this to levels in susceptible accession dza <dig>  we quantified the relative amount of fungal biomass in root and shoot tissues of a <dig> and dza <dig> seedlings by qrt-pcr over the early stages of infection between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. both a <dig> and dza <dig> had similar levels of fom biomass at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi in roots, with some growth also detected in shoots . however, by  <dig> dpi the relative abundance of fom had risen sharply and significantly in dza <dig> root tissues to levels ~5-fold greater than levels in a <dig> which remained similar to those detected at its  <dig> dpi time-point.

in vitro and in planta fusarium rna-sequencing
we hypothesized that increased fom colonisation of susceptible dza <dig> seedlings may be associated with changes in its pathogenicity gene expression profile compared to colonisation of a resistant a <dig> host. to capture fom genes expressed in resistant and susceptible plants and to compare and contrast their expression profiles we generated high coverage rna-seq data from infected root and shoot tissues of a <dig> and dza <dig> seedlings at  <dig> dpi where we detected no difference in host colonisation levels and at the later time-point of  <dig> dpi when disease symptoms start to manifest in susceptible plants . we confirmed that disease progressed as expected in seedlings used for rna-sequencing by scoring the percentage of diseased plants and survival at 7- <dig> dpi on plants from the same experiment that were not harvested for rna extractions . we also collected data from fom mycelia grown vegetatively  in order to compare levels of induction upon host detection and use this as a feature to facilitate identification of effectors or other pathogenicity-associated genes.

based on our previous qrt-pcr results  we estimated the relative abundance of fom transcripts to m. truncatula transcripts in harvested root tissues would range from  <dig> - <dig>  %. using this as a guide we conducted stranded rna-seq on three biological replicates for each treatment/tissue on an illumina hiseq platform  generating  <dig> − <dig>  gb data for each sample. after read processing , ~ <dig> million paired end reads were obtained for each sample and mapped to our fom reference genome assembly  <cit>  using tophat <dig>  <cit> . for the in vitro samples 93-94 % of reads could be mapped to the fom genome assembly, while for infected root samples the percentage of reads mapped ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  % at  <dig> dpi to  <dig> − <dig>  % at  <dig> dpi . less than  <dig>  % of reads could be mapped from the shoot samples, even at the later time point of  <dig> dpi . combined, the in vitro and in planta rna-seq supported expression of  <dig>  of the  <dig>  predicted fom gene models with  <dig>  expressed in planta based on mapping of one or more reads in any of the in planta samples. correlating with our fungal biomass results , similar percentages of reads could be mapped to the fom genome in samples harvested from a <dig> and dza <dig> roots at  <dig> dpi but at  <dig> dpi the number and percentage of mapped fom reads was up to  <dig> times greater in the dza <dig> samples compared to a <dig> table  <dig> mapping results of rna-seq data from fusarium infected a <dig>  or dza <dig>  root samples

identification of differentially expressed fusarium genes
to identify genes with a high potential for involvement in pathogenicity, we set out to identify fom genes differentially expressed between vegetative  and in planta growth conditions with the premise that genes involved in fungal pathogenicity would be switched on or more highly and rapidly expressed upon detection of a suitable host . aligned read counts  were used with a normalisation step to identify differentially expressed genes  between each dataset  with edger  <cit> . degs were selected based on a ≥ 2-fold change and a false discovery rate  ≤  <dig> . due to low proportion of fom reads in the rna-seq datasets, to decrease the number of false positives based on mapping of only a few reads or mapping of multiple reads to only one location, we added an additional criteria of at least 25 % read coverage of the predicted gene model in each of the  <dig> in planta replicates. in the early  <dig> dpi dataset replicates this equated to on average 84−92 % of transcripts with a minimum of  <dig> mapped reads, with individual gene models covered on average by  <dig> reads. similar additional deg criteria have been used in other lowly in planta expressed pathogen or endophyte studies  <cit> . full details of degs and characteristics of their encoded proteins are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi the number of degs induced/repressed in planta in dza <dig> was greater than those detected in a <dig> suggesting a larger degree of transcriptional reprogramming in the susceptible plant interaction . this was particularly evident at  <dig> dpi even when fom fungal biomass was comparable between susceptible and resistant plant roots  with 11 % more degs in the dza <dig> up-regulated dataset compared to a <dig>  and 30 % more genes with ≥ 95 % read coverage . by  <dig> dpi the difference in number of degs between dza <dig> and a <dig> increased by over  <dig> -fold, likely associated with the greater fungal colonisation of dza <dig> roots . in dza <dig> 80 % of degs up-regulated at  <dig> dpi were also up-regulated at  <dig> dpi, while this was only observed for 57 % of degs in a <dig> . considering the larger number of mapped reads and degs identified in dza <dig> at  <dig> dpi, less overlap between the  <dig> and  <dig> dpi dza <dig> datasets might be expected. this result suggests a fast, prolonged, and concerted expression of components of the fom pathogenicity arsenal during infection of susceptible plants. with the exception of fom_ <dig>  there were no genes detected in both up- and down-regulated datasets of either genotype. interestingly fom_ <dig> encodes a protein with characteristics of a small secreted protein  and containing ≤ one transmembrane domain in the n-terminal region  <cit> ), contains a cfem domain possibly associated with fungal pathogenicity  <cit> , and is predicted as a putative effector by the fungal effector prediction software effectorp  <cit> .fig.  <dig> number of fom genes differentially expressed between in vitro and in planta samples. a degs detected between fom grown in vitro  and during infection of a <dig> or dza <dig> roots at  <dig> or 7 days post inoculation . b-c venn diagrams of degs in overlapping datasets from b) a <dig> and c) dza <dig>  red and black arrows indicate up- or down-regulated in planta respectively



iv in vitro. note, degs in ≥ 95 % are also captured within the ≥ 50 % and ≥ 25 % datasets. likewise, degs in ≥ 50 % are captured within the ≥ 25 % dataset




we also examined rna-seq data from the same experiment, at the same level of sample read coverage obtained from the shoots of the fom inoculated dza <dig> or a <dig> plants but due to the relative low abundance of fungal transcripts in shoot tissues at our early sampling time-points only a handful of degs could be identified .

protein characteristics of differentially expressed genes with a focus on in planta up-regulated datasets
to assess differences in pathogenicity profiles of fom during interactions with susceptible or resistant medicago hosts, we focussed the remainder of our studies on degs up-regulated in planta versus in vitro. to interpret putative functions, we interrogated their predicted protein characteristics including gene ontology  terms, pfam domains and pathogenicity associated characteristics such as encoding ssps or similarity to known fungal effectors. although fungal effectors generally lack similarity to other proteins, they may share common protein motifs or characteristics such as a secretion signal, small size , increased number of paired cysteines, proximity to repetitive dna and these were therefore included in our analyses. fom protein characteristics were previously determined by  <cit>  and supported by annotations listed in publicly available fusarium spp. genome projects, phi-base  <cit>  and genbank. we also incorporated an assessment of putative chromosomal location based on our previous study  <cit> . fom scaffolds representing putative cd chromosomes were predicted based on the criteria of having no match to designated core chromosomes of f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici or f. solani, whose genome assemblies contain well characterised core and cd/accessory chromosome sequences.

one fifth of the predicted proteins in up-regulated deg datasets could not be assigned functional annotations and were annotated as uncharacterised. this included  <dig>  and  <dig>  in a <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively. in dza <dig> infected plants there were a similar number of uncharacterised proteins at  <dig> dpi  but within the  <dig> dpi dataset the total number of uncharacterised proteins more than tripled to  <dig> . nearly half of the latter were predicted as secreted and as putative effectors by effectorp.

of proteins in the up-regulated datasets that could be assigned go terms, 14−18 % were assigned to biological processes, 16−18 % molecular functions, and 3−4 % cellular components. thirty-six and  <dig> go terms could be assigned respectively to a <dig> and dza <dig>  <dig> dpi datasets, and  <dig> and  <dig> respectively in the  <dig> dpi datasets. of these, metabolic and catalytic activity represented the majority of classified proteins in all datasets, followed by catabolism, binding, hydrolase activity and biosynthesis in different percentages . the number of encoded proteins represented by these go terms were 3- <dig> times more in the dza <dig>  <dig> dpi dataset compared to a <dig> at the same time-point. for example, dza315:a <dig> carbohydrate metabolism 22: <dig>  lipid metabolism 13: <dig>  hydrolase activity 39: <dig>  catabolism 37: <dig>  signal transduction 5: <dig> .

for fom genes up-regulated in planta, a significant over-representation  of domains associated with degradation of proteins and sugars/carbohydrates , membrane transport  transporters, nucleobase cation symporter- <dig>  permease) and oxidative processes  was observed, particularly in dza <dig> . encapsulated, these results suggest host cell wall and membrane degradation along with nutrient transport are initiated earlier upon infection of susceptible plants, evident as early as  <dig> dpi compared to the resistant host interaction. by  <dig> dpi these processes were even more apparent during fom infection of susceptible plants, correlating with an increase in fungal biomass at this time point .fig.  <dig> pfam domains more abundant in the in planta up-regulated datasets. pfam domains enriched in the in planta up-regulated datasets from resistant  and susceptible  accessions relative to in vitro growth conditions are listed. schematic figures illustrate the tissue sampled , highlighting the chlorotic leaves visible at the later stage of the susceptible interaction). enriched pfam domains were identified based on comparisons against the total fom protein set using fisher’s exact test with a significance threshold of p ≤  <dig> . values are ranked by representation of pfam domains with colour coding signifying increasing abundance within each dataset. cs: counts of pfam domain containing proteins in deg dataset. % d: % representation of pfam domain containing proteins in deg dataset; % g: % representation of pfam domain containing proteins in whole genome. further details are provided in additional file  <dig>  aldeh: aldehyde dehydrogenase; aim24: mitochondrial biogenesis; cia30: mitochondrial complex i intermediate-associated protein; dabb: stress responsive a/b barrel domain; eutq: ethanolamine utilisation protein; gh: glycoside hydrolase; grp1_fun34_yaah: acetate transporter; gfa: glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme; gst: glutathione s-transferase; had: haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase; ligb: ligb subunit of aromatic ring-opening dioxygenase; meth_synthase: methionine synthases; ndt80_phog: dna binding-family; plac8: placenta-specific gene  <dig> protein; pyr_redox: pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase ; sbp: bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein; thiamine4: thiamine biosynthetic enzyme




searching for proteins involved in regulation of fom pathogenicity-associated gene expression, we identified four proteins annotated as fungal transcription factors with one  common to three of the datasets . fom_ <dig> is predicted cdc encoded and shares greatest similarity with proteins from f. oxysporum f. sp. raphani  and f. sp. pisi  but low similarity with other f. oxysporum ff. spp. . this protein contains a fungal specific transcription factor domain  and a fungal zn-cys binuclear cluster domain . the other transcription factors identified in the up-regulated datasets were only found in the dza <dig>  <dig> dpi dataset , are predicted to reside on core chromosomes and share most similarity to proteins from other f. oxysporum ff. spp.. the fom homologue  of fol transcription factor six gene expression  <dig>  whose expression is up-regulated during infection of tomato roots and is required for expression of most secreted fol effectors  <cit> , was detected as expressed in vitro but not detected as significantly up-regulated in our in planta deg datasets.

next we applied several criteria to identify candidate effector and host-specific pathogenicity genes. these included characteristics such as predicted secretion, in planta up-regulated gene expression and chromosomal location, as f. oxysporum effectors have previously been identified on non-core or conditionally dispensable chromosomes . the majority of degs in all datasets were located on scaffolds predicted to form part of core fom chromosomes  <cit>  . most degs predicted to lie on putative cd chromosomes were only identified within the up-regulated datasets . degs encoding ssps were also predominantly identified within the in planta up-regulated datasets . interestingly the number of ssps in a <dig> datasets didn’t differ much between the two sampled time-points but in dza <dig> the number almost tripled between the  <dig> and  <dig> dpi up-regulated datasets . further, degs within the susceptible dza <dig> datasets also contained a larger proportion of genes expressed more highly in planta and these were enriched for ssps .fig.  <dig> degs in up-regulated datasets contain an enrichment of genes located on putative non-core chromosomes and encoding predicted small secreted proteins. a-b predicted putative chromosomal location of degs with a) total numbers in each dataset and b) percentage of degs predicted to reside on a predicted conditionally dispensable chromosome . c degs predicted to encode small secreted proteins within each dataset




overall, the enrichment during the early stages of infection of genes encoding ssps, uncharacterised proteins and proteins with roles in protein/sugar degradation and their transport, oxidative stress and other pathogenicity associated processes indicates substantial changes in pathogen gene expression upon colonisation of a susceptible host.

highly up-regulated genes unique to in planta up-regulated datasets from a susceptible or resistant host and links to pathogenicity
as we were most interested in identifying pathogenicity factors we focused firstly on the differences between genes expressed during infection of resistant or susceptible host accessions  and secondly on those that were expressed during both infection of a susceptible and a resistant host .

firstly we compared degs unique to infection of each host accession. under this analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were uniquely significantly up-regulated in a <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi respectively, while  <dig> and  <dig> were unique to dza <dig> at the same time-points . of those expressed during infection of a <dig> at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> of the most highly induced  were co-localised at the genomic scale  and another, fom_ <dig>  is a predicted ssp showing similarity to an uncharacterized protein from the rice pathogen fusarium fujikori. at  <dig> dpi in a <dig> all six unique degs were core scaffold located with two induced >100-fold and encoding ssps .fig.  <dig> unique and overlapping fom degs between a <dig> and dza <dig> in planta up-regulated datasets. venn diagram of degs in overlapping a <dig> and dza <dig> in planta up-regulated datasets. red arrows indicate up-regulated in planta

the  <dig> unique degs from the dza <dig>  <dig> dpi dataset comprised of both core and non-core located genes with inductions ranging from  <dig>  to > <dig> -fold over in vitro conditions and encoding several fad-binding proteins, hydrolases, peptidase, mfs transporter and p <dig> amongst others. of the  <dig> significant degs in the dza <dig>  <dig> dpi unique dataset the majority were core scaffold located  and  <dig> were up-regulated in planta over 100-fold. several were also co-localised . two fom ssps  with similarity to the phytotoxin cerato-platanin were also only identified in the dza <dig> in planta  <dig> dpi up-regulated dataset. some cerato-platanin members in other phytopathogens are implicated in disruption of host cell walls through expansin-like activity, chitin oligomer sequestration and the ability to induce plant cell necrosis  <cit> . other proteins only upregulated in dza <dig> at  <dig> dpi included a xylosidase arabinosidase  and an l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase  with implied roles respectively in the hydrolysis of major hemicellulose component xylan to xylose and other sugars, and the catabolism of l-arabinose, an important constituent of plant cell wall polysaccharides.

we first assessed the overlapping degs for the presence of those encoding the well documented f. oxysporum secreted in xylem  proteins, with known roles in virulence and/or avirulence described for some in f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis or fo <dig>  . six proteins can broadly be defined as small, generally cysteine rich, and possessing a secretion signal  <cit> . of the 14 f. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici six proteins described so far, all four that we previously identified in the fom genome   <cit>  were significantly upregulated in all in planta datasets where they were amongst the top in planta induced degs. fom_six <dig> was the most highly induced at levels  <dig> million times greater than in vitro . qrt-pcr verification of fom six gene expression over a  <dig> to 7 day infection time-course revealed all but fom_six <dig> could be reliably detected under in vitro conditions suggesting expression of this six gene in fom responds specifically to detection of a possible host . correlating with our rna-seq data , qrt-pcr examination of all four fom six genes confirmed these genes were overall more highly expressed in dza <dig> than a <dig>  interestingly fom_six <dig> and fom_six <dig> didn’t meet the statistical cut-off of the effectorp  <cit>  prediction algorithm .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of candidate effector genes in vitro versus in planta over an infection time-course. expression of candidate effector genes as determined by qrt-pcr in in vitro samples and m. truncatula dza <dig> and a <dig> root samples harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7 days post inoculation  with fom. in vitro samples are averages ± se of  <dig> biological replicates. in planta samples are averages ± se of  <dig> biological replicates each consisting of pools of  <dig> seedlings. gene expression levels are relative to the fungal gpda gene . note: * no detectable expression in any in vitro replicates




after fom_six <dig>  the next three most highly in-planta induced degs are strong effector candidates. these encode fom_ <dig> a fom-unique protein with unknown function, fom_ <dig> a ssp encoding a lysm-domain , and fom_ <dig> an uncharacterised protein with orthologs in other f. oxysporum ff. spp.. qrt-pcr verification of fom_ <dig> expression confirmed increased expression in dza <dig> over a <dig> and absence of expression under in vitro conditions . similar results were observed for fom_ <dig>  interestingly, fom_ <dig> was lowly expressed under in vitro conditions. along with fom_ <dig>  another lysm-domain containing ssp gene  was also significantly upregulated, but only at  <dig> dpi. the fom_ <dig> encoded protein contains one lysm domain, sharing best similarity to a protein from f. oxysporum f. sp. pisi , other f. oxysporum ff. spp. and colletotrichum species. fom_ <dig> contains two lysm domains and is most similar to proteins from other f. oxysporum ff.spp. and the rice pathogen f. fujikuroi.

other highly in planta up-regulated genes included three proteases/peptidases and genes involved in oxidative stress responses . of the latter type, fom_ <dig> and fom_ <dig> both encode peroxidases predicted to reside alongside each other. fom_ <dig> is a predicted effector and ssp sharing 95 % identity to other f. oxysporum peroxidases/catalases or hypothetical proteins, as well as to proteins from f. solani, f. fujikori, and colletotrichum and verticillium species.

several uncharacterised proteins with properties of effectors were also identified as highly up-regulated in-planta during infection of both resistant and susceptible m. truncatula accessions . of those predicted as ssps, only two were not predicted as effectors by effectorp and these encode a putative endoglucanase  and a cupredoxin domain-containing protein  sharing 94-96 % similarity with several other serine rich proteins from f. oxysporum ff. spp. the serine rich nature of this protein may imply possible involvement in post-translational regulatory processes or protein-protein interactions. the remaining novel uncharacterised effector-like proteins identified contain no other known functional protein domains.

discussion
the success of a pathogen’s attack requires the co-ordinated early expression of its pathogenicity arsenal. while an increasing list of putative arsenal components from various f. oxysporum ff. spp. have been predicted via whole genome sequencing or more classical pcr-based approaches, the relatively low abundance of fungal transcripts in host root tissues during early stages of infection has meant that very few whole transcriptome based identification studies have been accomplished. to overcome the constraint of low f. oxysporum rna abundance in m. truncatula root tissues early in infection, we coupled our draft fom genome assembly  <cit>  and the pathogen’s vegetative  transcriptome with high coverage in planta rna-seq of inoculated host roots to identify genes specifically up-regulated upon host infection. comparison of a susceptible versus a resistant m. truncatula accession at 48 h post infection and at the later time-point of  <dig> dpi when disease symptoms on susceptible m. truncatula plants start to manifest, facilitated the identification of degs either unique or common to resistant or susceptible f. oxysporum-legume host interactions. these studies revealed a greater degree of transcriptional reprogramming during the susceptible plant interaction including expression of genes encoding ssps and genes associated with plant cell wall and membrane degradation, nutrient uptake and oxidative processes. in addition we identified novel candidate effectors and pathogenicity-associated genes highly induced during infection of both susceptible and resistant plants.

to date, several transcriptome studies  examining the f. oxysporum-host interaction have been reported, including those from infected roots of arabidopsis, cabbage, banana, melon, cotton, chickpea, soybean or medicago. the majority of these studies only included comparative analyses amongst plant transcripts due to insufficient sequencing depth for fungal transcript detection . transcriptome analysis of this pathogen is also hindered by inherent variations in f. oxysporum root-colonisation dynamics at early stages of host colonisation and subsequent variations in disease progression amongst individual plants. those studies with probes unique to the pathogen or enough coverage to detect pathogen transcripts are limited and have typically involved analysis of later time-points in the pathogen-host interaction process. for example, schmidt and colleagues  <cit>  analysed the expression of f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis transcripts at  <dig> dpi on melon roots. here we were able to overcome these constraints by pooling root tissues from fom inoculated m. truncatula seedlings and combining high coverage rna-seq with our stringent deg selection criteria.

in addition to in planta f. oxysporum transcriptome analysis, in planta proteomics has been used to identify f. oxysporum pathogenicity components. the combined studies of rep, houterman, schmidt and their colleagues  <cit>  which identified several avirulence and virulence products of fol in the xylem sap proteome of infected tomato plants, were the first to identify the key secreted in xylem  effectors. two studies have been conducted on the root proteomes of f. oxysporum infected legumes  however, neither of these studies assessed the presence of fusarium proteins.

via rna-seq guo and colleagues  <cit>  were successful in comparing the vegetative transcriptomes of two races  of f. oxysporum f. sp. cubense against their transcriptomes at 2 days post-infection of cavendish banana. as with our in planta up-regulated fom analysis, guo and colleagues  <cit>  found the largest groups of expressed genes were significantly enriched for catalytic and metabolic activities. however, the next most enriched go term assignments differed between our studies, with the f. oxysporum f. sp. cubense datasets enriched for primary/cellular/nitrogen compound metabolic and biosynthetic processes, while fom in planta datasets were most enriched for binding/catabolism/biosynthesis/and hydrolase activity, followed by cell/carbohydrate metabolism/and nucleic acid metabolism . this suggests that at the early time-point of  <dig> dpi of medicago roots there is a substantial bias towards host cell wall and membrane degradation and the metabolism of released nutrient sources such as sugars. furthermore, these processes were more pronounced during the susceptible m. truncatula dza315-fom interaction  even though at  <dig> dpi the degree of fom colonisation was not significantly different between the susceptible dza <dig> and resistant a <dig> m. truncatula hosts . it is interesting to speculate that differences observed between fom and f. oxysporum f. sp. cubense may potentially be due to differences in root tissue or cell structure between a dicot/legume or monocot host.

functional analysis revealed enrichment during infection of susceptible dza <dig> plants of fom degs encoding protein domains  associated with degradation of proteins and carbohydrates/sugars as well as membrane transport and oxidative processes . lower numbers of these protein features were detected in the a <dig> up-regulated deg datasets, with more pronounced differences observed at  <dig> dpi when a significant increase in fom biomass was recorded in susceptible plants . like other pathogenic plant-fungal pathogens, f. oxysporum genomes are enriched in plant cell wall degrading enzymes   and are known to secrete these extracellular degradative enzymes during host colonization  <cit> . these include enzymes such as polygalacturonases, pectate lyases, xylanases and proteases to break down cell walls and membranes to release nutrient sources such as sugars  <cit>  with expression during infection and roles in virulence demonstrated for some via double deletion mutants   <cit> . fom genes highly expressed during infection of susceptible plants included several proteases/peptidases  and pectate lyases with proposed roles in degradation of pectin and other cell wall components. recently it was demonstrated that a secreted fol metalloprotease and serine protease could cleave tomato chitinases with double deletion mutants of these two genes impaired in virulence on tomato  <cit> . other fom highly in planta expressed genes included several glycoside hydrolases that may act on the substrates sucrose, pectin, hemicellulose and chitin . fungal chitinases belong exclusively to the glycosyl hydrolase   <dig> family, but apart from a fundamental role in chitin hydrolysis little is known about their role during pathogen-plant interactions  <cit> . it is suggested that during host infection they may have roles in fungal cell wall remodelling including involvement in processes such as spore germination, hyphal tip growth and branching  <cit> . transcripts encoding proteins with roles in membrane transport such as permeases, and sugar, amino acid and major facilitator superfamily  transporters were also highly up-regulated and enriched in the dza <dig> deg datasets implying enhanced uptake of nutrient sources such as sugars released from plant roots by the aforementioned enzymes.

cytochrome p450s were overrepresented in the in planta up-regulated fom deg datasets suggesting important roles in pathogenicity, with two identified in the overlapping datasets . located adjacent to one of these  is a putative effector  whose expression was up-regulated in both a <dig> and dza <dig>  <dig> dpi and shares 69 % protein identity to the verticillium dahliae isochorismatase effector vdisc <dig> which is required for full pathogenesis and disrupts plant defense responses by interfering with salicylate production  <cit> . three oxidoreductases and two peroxidases  were identified in the overlapping in planta up-regulated deg dataset . a secreted fol catalase-peroxidase  and an oxidoreductase  were detected in the xylem sap proteome of fol-infected tomato plants suggesting they are important for infection  <cit> . fom_ <dig> shares 84 % amino acid identity with foxg_ <dig> and similar levels of identify with other f. oxysporum ff. spp. catalase/peroxidases, but differs by only one amino acid from a predicted catalase/peroxidase from the pea-infecting f. oxysporum f. sp. pisi hdv <dig> . other genes expressed within the dza <dig>  <dig> dpi unique dataset included hydrolases, oxidases, oxidoreductases, phytotoxic cerato-platanins and several cytochrome p450s with similarity to pisatin demethylases   that may degrade phytoalexin pterocarpans produced by medicago species. while some of these genes were detected during infection of a <dig> they did not meet the minimum read coverage criteria.

a significant proportion of the in planta up-regulated fom degs were enriched for proteins with no functional annotation including the tripling of abundance of uncharacterised genes in dza <dig> infection between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. we applied several criteria to narrow in on proteins within these datasets that may have roles in host-specific pathogenicity. one of these, up-regulated in planta expression during host infection, is a stringent criteria that has been successfully applied to identify and/or verify avirulence  proteins and putative effectors in other ff. spp. of f. oxysporum  <cit> . for example, expression of fol avr <dig>  and fol six <dig> whose gene products are respectively recognised by the tomato f. oxysporum resistance gene i <dig> or suppress i2-mediated cell death, are strongly induced in the presence of living plant cells  <cit> . it should be noted that not all fungal effectors are exclusively expressed in planta  and we therefore did not ignore any potential effector candidates that were expressed in our in vitro dataset. we also placed emphasis on genes likely to be ssps and cdc encoded as in the genus fusarium cdcs are often enriched in rapidly evolving genes, can be horizontally transferred and encode novel effector candidates detected in the xylem sap of fol infected tomato plants  <cit> . the majority of candidate effectors we identified from our overlapping expression analysis  were either unique to fom and thus may define its host specificity, or were conserved to some degree with proteins of other f. oxysporum ff. spp. or other fusaria and thus may have conserved roles in plant pathogenicity. we identified two proteins  that share a high degree of similarity to proteins from anthracnose disease causing colletotrichum species. this similarity has been reported previously between effectors from fol or f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis  or candidate effectors from other fusaria  <cit> . fom_ <dig> contains a lysin motif  and shares some similarity to extracellular protein <dig>  of unknown function from the tomato fungal pathogen cladosporium fulvum and a lysm containing effector candidate from f. oxysporum f. sp. melonis  <cit> . it is suggested that other c. fulvum effectors containing the lysm-domain may suppress chitin triggered immunity by protecting fungal hyphae against host chitinases or sequestering fungal cell wall derived chitin fragments from host detection . the fom genome encodes  <dig> proteins with lysm-domains and in addition to up-regulated in planta expression of the predicted cdc encoded fom_ <dig>  we also identified a core chromosome encoded lysm-domain containing protein  sharing this expression profile. the vascular wilt pathogen verticillium dahliae also contains an expanded lysm effector family but the expression of only one of these is induced in planta  <cit> . this effector, vdag_ <dig>  is cdc encoded and contributes to virulence on tomato, while the remaining lysm-domain proteins are core chromosome located, not expressed during infection and single deletion mutants have no effect on virulence  <cit> . while the roles of the latter putative v. dahliae lysm effectors remains ambiguous, the in planta up-regulated expression of fom_ <dig> and fom_ <dig> suggests these two ssps may contribute to pathogenicity.

the most highly in planta up-regulated gene detected in all fom datasets  was fom_six <dig> whose expression could not be detected under vegetative conditions by either rna-seq or qrt-pcr . the functional role of six <dig> homologues across f. oxysporum ff. spp. is unknown. previously we found fom_six <dig> shares most similarity with a six <dig> homologue from a melon-infecting f. oxysporum isolate and less similarity with its legume-infecting counterparts in f. sp. pisi or f. sp. ciceris, although it was the only six gene common to the legume-infecting ff. spp. analysed  <cit> . recently, additional six <dig> sequences have been identified in other f. oxysporum f. sp. pisi isolates   <cit>  and blastn analysis  <cit>  revealed the fom_six <dig> gene sequence shares 98 % identity with these two f. sp. pisi six <dig> sequences suggesting potentially conserved roles on legume hosts. within the overlapping in planta up-regulated degs we also identified seven genes unique to fom and sharing no orthologues with other fungal species. this includes three uncharacterised proteins, a glycoside hydrolase, two proteases and a peptidase . of these, the cdc encoded ssp fom_ <dig> contains a motif resembling a zinc finger domain suggesting this protein may bind host dna sequences  <cit> . these features combined with its expression only during infection, earmarks fom_ <dig> as a host-specific effector for future functional studies and identification of its possible host target.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings greatly improve the current understanding of fusarium wilt pathogen molecular responses during early stages of legume colonisation and infection. our analysis of in planta up-regulated genes represents a significant resource that can be leveraged to hone in on candidate effectors and pathogenicity associated genes from other f. oxysporum ff. spp.. prioritisation for functional follow up studies to elucidate the role of candidate fom effectors listed within table  <dig> will focus on those that are fom specific and thus have implied roles in host specificity or those that are highly conserved amongst other legume infecting f. oxysporum ff. spp. and will expedite the dissection of their pathogenicity mechanisms on important global legume crops.
