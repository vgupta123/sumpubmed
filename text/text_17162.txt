BACKGROUND
the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza a  viruses from asia to the middle east, europe, and africa poses the threat of an influenza pandemic. vaccination of poultry is an effective measure to control virus spread  <cit> . current production of inactivated influenza vaccine requires high-level biocontainment facilities and large numbers of embryonated chicken eggs, while baculovirus surface displayed recombinant hemagglutinin may be an attractive alternative to the effective influenza vaccine  <cit> .

white spot syndrome virus , a major pathogen in shrimp, can infect a wide range of invertebrate tissues and cells. wssv genome has  <dig> repeated regions similar to those of baculovirus, suggesting the potential to exploit wssv promoters in baculovirus and insect cell expression system  <cit> . baculovirus produces high yield of foreign soluble protein in insect cells and mediates efficient transduction of mammalian cells. thus, it is widely used as a vaccine production system  <cit> . wssv ie <dig> promoter was reported as one of the strongest promoters in insect cells  <cit> . however, no documented report has compared the activity of wssv ie <dig> promoter with other promoters in vaccine production. in this study recombinant baculoviruses were constructed under wssv ie <dig> promoter, in an attempt to establish a novel platform for efficient antigen expression. these recombinant baculoviruses were further evaluated in the hemagglutinin production of h5n <dig> influenza virus.

the influenza virus ha glycoprotein has receptor-binding activity and mediates viral-endosomal membrane fusion during viral entry and serves as the primary target for neutralizing antibodies  <cit> . ha protein from h5n <dig> influenza virus expressed in baculovirus mediated by wssv ie <dig> promoter can be displayed on baculovirus surface without disrupting its authentic cleavage, hemagglutination activity and immunogenicity  <cit> . besides, baculovirus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein  emerges as a promising gene-delivery vector by virtue of its capability in transducing numerous mammalian cells  <cit> . coexpressed with vsv g in baculovirus, the ha protein could be delivered into host cells to elicit immune response in a long term. for the efficient ha delivery to target cells, an active promoter is required in both vertebrate and invertebrate species.

the current study compared wssv ie <dig> promoter with cmv promoter in the context of baculovirus vector for the efficient expression of ha protein from h5n <dig> influenza virus as a surface-displayed immunogen in sf <dig>  cells. further studies on immunogenicity were performed for these baculovirus vaccines under wssv ie <dig> promoter in chickens. the results demonstrated that ha of h5n <dig> influenza virus could be more efficiently produced by baculovirus with wssv ie <dig> promoter, which serves as a safe vaccine in chickens and provides effective immune protection from avian influenza.

RESULTS
wssv ie <dig> promoter mediates efficient protein expression in sf <dig> cells
in order to investigate whether the relative strength of the promoter was cell type dependent, a plasmid containing wssv iel promoter  for luciferase expression was transfected into cef and sf <dig> cells to test luciferase activity, in comparison to cmv . luciferase activity, indicating intracellular luciferase quantity, was presented in folds of the basic value set in the system. hence, a link was established between promoter activity and luciferase activity. sv <dig> promoter was used as a control promoter in both insect and mammalian cells. vero cells were used to normalize transfection efficiency. cmv promoter activity  was much weaker than the wssv iel promoter  in sf <dig> cells. in cef cells, the wssv iel promoter activity  was slightly less than the cmv  . the data indicated that the wssv iel promoter activity was strong in insect cells, in which cmv promoter activity was weak. furthermore, wssv ie <dig> promoter was found to be active in all of the vertebrate cells tested here, including human tk-143b, monkey marc <dig>  vero, porcine pk <dig> and carp epithelioma papillosum  . this property of wssv ie <dig> promoter renders it a promising candidate for efficient protein expression in baculovirus infected sf <dig> cells.

wssv ie <dig> promoter stimulates strong h <dig> hemagglutinin expression in baculovirus
to further compare wssv ie <dig> promoter with cmv promoter in the efficiency of protein expression, four recombinant baculoviruses were constructed, termed as vac-ie-ha and vac-cmv-ha expressing ha; vac-g-ie-ha and vac-g-cmv-ha coexpressing vsv g protein with ha for gene transduction  <cit>  . to confirm the activity of wssv ie <dig> promoter in sf <dig> cells as shown in luciferase test, sf <dig> cells were infected with the four recombinant baculoviruses individually. the infected cells were fixed and subjected to antibody staining  <dig> days postinfection. 3d <dig> and 8b <dig> are two different h5-specific monoclonal antibodies used in these studies  <cit> . as shown in fig 3a, indirect fluorescence signals from ha protein were strong and sharp by recombinant baculoviruses with wssv ie <dig> promoter. ha expression was detected in cells infected with cmv promoter-controlled baculoviruses though the fluorescence signals were diffused and faded. for those baculoviruses with vsv g cassette, the staining with anti-vsvg antibody verified the successful coexpression of vsv g protein and suggested the selected promoter has no effect on the infection efficiency .

baculovirus-expressed ha sustains hemagglutination activity. the ha titer of baculoviruses under different promoters was evaluated with the same number of virus particles.  <dig> Î¼l of baculovirus at a titer of  <dig> pfu/ml was used in the standard hemagglutination assay. data were collected from  <dig> parallel assays. as shown in figure 3b, constructs under wssv ie <dig> promoter gave a higher mean hemagglutination titer of 1: <dig>  to 1: <dig> , while those under cmv were at a mean titer of 1: <dig>  to1: <dig>  . coexpression of vsv g protein had no significant effect on the hemagglutination result . besides, at a mean titer of 1: <dig>  vac-pol-ha, a ha-expressing construct under baculovirus polyhedrin promoter, was included in this hemagglutination test as a system control, since it is widely used in recombinant baculoviruses for ha production  <cit> . the ha titer of vac-ie-ha was higher than vac-pol-ha at the same virus copies , indicating its advantage in ha production.

to verify this result, recombinant virus copies and ha contents were measured in a time course study during baculovirus infection. as shown in fig. 3c, the temporal kinetics of the growth curves for these viruses were similar  <cit>  among the three promoters studied here. however, differences were found in ha production with the three promoters . with wssv ie <dig> promoter, the ha content in virions was up to  <dig>  ug/ml  corresponding to the virus titer of  <dig> pfu/ml at 96h post-infection. the ha content of polyhedrin promoter was  <dig>  ug/ml  at the similar virus titer, while the ha production of cmv promoter was around  <dig> ug/ml  at the same collection time. in anova test, p values for comparisons among three promoters at each time point were less than  <dig>  and the differences between each two groups were considered as significant.  taken together, these results indicated that wssv ie <dig> promoter can induce more abundant h <dig> hemagglutinin expression in baculovirus with hemagglutination activity, in comparison to polyhedrin promoter, as well as cmv promoter.

immunogenicity of h <dig> hemagglutinin expressed by wssv ie <dig> promoter in chickens
the immunogenicity of baculovirus under wssv ie <dig> promoter or cmv promoter was subsequently investigated through intramuscular  or intranasal immunization  of 2-week-old chickens with purified live virions without adjuvant. the live h5n <dig> vaccine  was used as the positive control, while pbs vaccinated chickens served as negative controls. the same h5n <dig>  strain was inactivated with bei   <cit>  as another control. the serology assays performed here were based on five different serum samples from five individual chickens in the each group . to determine the neutralizing antibody level in those chicken sera, hi tests were performed with h5n <dig> . as shown in table  <dig>  the wssv ie1-type baculoviruses elicit higher hi titer than cmv promoter in serum samples. coexpression of vsv g also contributes to an increase in anti-ha antibody level with hi activity. in addition, to confirm this result about the neutralization activity, a standard micro-neutralization test was performed with h5n <dig>  in mdck cells. the sera induced by wssv ie1-controlled ha-displaying baculoviruses showed a higher neutralization titer than those from cmv promoter, while coexpression of vsv g protein enhanced the neutralization titer in samples of both wssv ie <dig> and cmv promoters. further, serum samples were tested in elisa. serum samples from the second collection were diluted at  <dig> fold in pbs and tested for the anti-ha antibody level. for those samples from intramuscular injection , at the same dosage of virus inoculated, the chickens immunized with those baculoviruses under wssv ie <dig> promoter developed higher antibody response than those under cmv promoter . moreover, coexpression of vsv g protein contributed to an increase in anti-h <dig> antibody level  due to the transduction mediated by vsv g protein. in the lack of constant virus replication in vivo, antibody levels of these wssv ie <dig> baculovirus immunized chickens were relatively lower than those of live h5n <dig>  infected chickens , but they were higher than those of immunized chickens with inactivated h5n <dig>  at the same protein dosage . for those intranasally immunized chickens by baculovirus, lower igg response was detected compared with intramuscularly injected chickens . furthermore, cut-off value of this elisa was determined as  <dig>  based on tests with healthy new-born chicken serum. to further evaluate the ha-specific antibody level in sera, the dilution factor of each serum sample was recorded  at the value beyond  <dig>  in elisa. the data obtained in this method is consistent to the results from other tests performed here. all of these findings indicated that efficient production of ha by wssv ie <dig> promoter in baculovirus allowed it to be exploited as a vaccine production platform.

significant antigen expression in chicken tissue was induced by ha-vsv g coexpression constructs
to further study ha-transduction in immunized chickens and detect antigen expression in tissue based on vaccination, immunohistochemistry of frozen tissue sections from chickens was performed with an h5-specfic monoclonal antibody  <dig> weeks after the second vaccination. four chickens of each group were tested. similar results were found among  <dig> chickens in the group of vac-g-ie-ha by im,  <dig> of vac-g-ie-ha by in,  <dig> of vac-g-cmv-ha by im and  <dig> of vac-g-cmv-ha by in. in both of the two promoter groups, signals were mainly observed in the lung tissues  and thymus tissues . as shown in fig 4c, in frozen tissue sections from chickens inoculated with recombinant ha-expressing baculovirus under wssv ie <dig> promoter , signals of ha expression appeared intensive and distributed densely. in tissues from chickens inoculated with recombinant baculovirus vac-g-cmv-ha, sporadic signals for ha expression were observed. these results gave direct evidence of successful protein transduction by vsv g-expressing baculoviruses. in addition, the recombinant baculovirus under wssv ie <dig> promoter was shown to bring strong antigen expression in chicken tissues, which depends on its activity of ha expression in both of insect and chicken cells.

discussion
the recombinant baculoviruses under wssv ie <dig> promoter presented here, present advantages in ha production and gene transduction, relying on its promoter efficiency in both vertebrate and invertebrate species. in this study, cmv promoter was used for major comparison because it displayed activity in both mammalian and insect cells as indicated in luciferase assays and it is widely used for protein expression and gene transduction in numerous cell lines  <cit> . however, cmv promoter might be relatively weak for protein expression in insect cells. therefore, wssv ie <dig> promoter was also compared with polyhedrin promoter from baculovirus in ha expression in insect cells. the results confirmed the role of wssv ie <dig> promoter as an efficient promoter for baculovirus mediated protein expression. ha expressed in baculovirus served as exogenous antigen to stimulate primary immune response, while ha de novo expression in chicken tissue will contribute to the trigger of new ha-antibody production for further protection in a long run  <cit> . for gene transduction, although cmv promoter is stronger in chicken cells than wssv ie <dig> promoter, as indicated in luciferase assays, such advantage could be offset by the stronger ha expression on viral surface with wssv ie <dig> promoter, which eventually leads to enhanced ha-specific immune response in chickens  <cit> .

to further verify those advantages brought by wssv ie <dig> promoter in vaccine production, the immunogenicity of these baculovirus-based immunogens was studied with chickens. in the comparison of different promoters in the same type of baculovirus construct, vaccine dose was based on virus copies rather than protein contents in order to differentiate the ha production efficiency by different promoters with the same amount of baculovirus copies   <cit> . as shown here, at the same dosage of baculovirus, constructs with wssv ie <dig> promoter elicited better immune response than cmv promoter, confirming the higher ha expression level by wssv ie <dig> promoter. meanwhile, when the comparison was performed between baculovirus and attenuated h5n <dig> influenza virus, dosage was based on ha contents  due to differences in viral property.

as the direct evidence for gene transduction, ha antigen expression in tissues was revealed in ihc assays. the results were repeatedly observed in most chickens from each group and considered to be significant. for intranasal inoculation, lung is the major organ to directly contact immunogen upon vaccination, where vsv g mediates virus entry and ha expresses with its individual promoter. also, as the major organ involved in immunity of avian species, thymus supports exogenous antigen expression  <cit> . therefore, for intramuscular injections, most of ha expression was detected in chicken thymus.

although baculovirus-expressed hemagglutinin influenza vaccines have been widely used and well characterized in different ways and under variant vector designs  <cit> , innovative methods are under investigation for more efficient ha production at a higher hemagglutination titer. wssv ie <dig> promoter supports the abundant production of ha in baculovirus system, as compared with other promoters tested here. this allows it to induce higher level of specific antibody response in immunized poultries at the same number of baculovirus copies. in addition, compared with inactivated h <dig> influenza virus vaccines at the same dose of ha protein , data shown here indicates that wssv ie <dig> promoter-mediated baculovirus vaccine could present better immunogenicity without biosafety concerns in vaccine preparation  <cit> . this also suggests that there could be some other properties of wssv ie1-controlled baculovirus contributing to better immunogenicity. one possibility is that the surface-displayed ha in baculovirus sustains its natural conformation upon vaccination due to the obviation of the inactivation process in the baculovirus-type vaccine production  <cit> . future studies will focus to identify whether other properties of wssv ie <dig> promoter support strong immunogenicity. taken together, our studies provide an alternative choice for the efficient production of surface-displayed ha with baculovirus. its vaccine potential was primarily studied in chickens, which might throw light on its promising trials in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
with wssv ie <dig> promoter, the recombinant baculovirus provided an efficient and expeditious method in vaccine production, compared with traditional means. wssv ie <dig> promoter-mediated baculovirus conferred better immunogenicity in chickens upon vaccination in the light of the efficient ha expression in both insect and chicken cells. this study fully characterized the capacity of baculovirus featuring wssv ie <dig> promoter in antigen production and immune response elicitation in chickens, suggesting it could be a promising choice as an efficient vaccine production system.
