BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have been successfully conducted to detect disease susceptibility genes for common complex human diseases by focusing on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and phenotypes  <cit> . while traditional methods for gwas consider only one snp at a time, some common complex human diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and various types of cancers are known to be influenced by multiple genetic variants  <cit> . in addition, one of the greatest challenges in gwas is to discover gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions.

classic logistic regression can be used to analyze the gene-gene interaction  <cit> . however, logistic regression suffers from an overfitting problem in high-order interactions  <cit> . multifactor dimensionality reduction  method is a nonparametric, model-free, and combinatorial approach for interaction analysis by identification of a multi-locus model for association in case-control studies  <cit> . mdr method reduces multi-locus genotypes into two disease risk groups: high-risk and low-risk groups. if the ratio of cases and controls in a combination of genotypes is larger than a pre-assigned threshold t , the cell of combination is labelled as "high risk", otherwise, "low risk". mdr method shows greater power for testing high-order interactions compared with logistic regression analysis  <cit> . several statistical methods have been extended from mdr approach  <cit> . one of the extended methods of mdr is a generalized mdr  proposed by lou et al.  <cit> . gmdr method allows adjusting for covariates and applying to both dichotomous and continuous phenotypes; it uses the score-based statistic obtained from generalized linear model of phenotypes on the predictor-variable and covariates instead of the ratio of cases and controls in original mdr method.

these gwas methods are generally implemented in a univariate framework analysing one phenotype at a time even though multiple phenotypes of interest are collected from a study population. in particular, pleiotropy that occurs due to potential genetic correlation between multiple phenotypic traits plays a role in pathogenesis of correlated human diseases  <cit> . jointly analysing correlated multivariate phenotypes may have more power to detect susceptible genes and gene-gene interactions by using more information from data. classic multivariate methods such as likelihood based mixed effects model  <cit>  and generalize estimating equations   <cit> , and extended versions of these methods  <cit>  can be applied to multivariate phenotypes of gwas.

in this study, we have proposed multivariate gmdr method by extending gmdr method for the multivariate phenotypes. we construct gee model with multivariate phenotypes to extend generalized linear models. the gee approach is exceptionally useful method for the analysis of longitudinal data, especially when the response variable is discrete  <cit> . using the score vectors from gee, we discriminate high-risk from low-risk groups. the proposed multivariate gmdr method can also handle the repeatedly measured phenotypes.

we apply the proposed multivariate gmdr method to the korean association resource study on blood pressure: systolic blood pressure  and diastolic blood pressure . a number of authors have investigated the genome-wide association studies on blood pressure and hypertension for korean population  <cit>  and for others  <cit> . however, not much work has been done for gene-gene interaction analyses. we compare the results of multivariate gmdr for sbp and dbp to the results from original univariate gmdr for sbp and dbp, respectively. we also apply the multivariate gmdr method to the repeated measured hypertension phenotypes and compare its result with those from univariate gmdr at each time point.

methods
multivariate gmdr
we introduce the generalized estimating equation  regarding a multivariate version of generalized linear model  which is implemented in gmdr. let yi=t be the t× <dig> vector of the phenotypes for subject i , with expectation e=μit. for the multivariate phenotype vector, yi, we assume an underlying generalized linear model which can be written as

 ηi=gμi=xiβ+ziγ, 

where g denotes a known one-to-one link function that is allowed to change with the characteristics of the different types of phenotype yi. xi and zi represent design matrices of genotype values and known covariate values including the unit component, respectively, and  β and  γ are vectors of their corresponding parameters, respectively. we assume that yit has a probability distribution belonging to the exponential family of distributions formed as

 fyit;θit,ϕ=expyitθit-bθit/ϕ+c. 

the gee estimators of δ= for marginal models can be obtained from the solution of a set of following generalized estimating equations:

 uδ= ∑i=1n∂μi∂δ⊺vi-1yi-μi= <dig>  

where ∂μi/∂δ is a matrix of derivatives whose hth column is ∂μi/∂δh. vi is constructed as vi=ϕbi1/2rαbi1/ <dig>  where bi=diagb″θit is a diagonal matrix with main diagonal elements of variance function, b″θit, and  r is a correlation matrix. vi and  r are "working" covariance and correlation to distinguish them from the true covariance and correlation among yi, respectively. when we use canonical link function, ∂θi/∂ηi is the identity matrix. let ci be the matrix of predictor values with xi and zi for subject i. by the chain rule,

 ∂μi∂δ=∂μi∂θi∂θi∂ηi∂ηi∂δ=biiici. 

then the score equations for  δ are

 uδ= ∑i=1nci⊺bivi-1yi-μi. 

the expression, bivi-1yi-μi can be written as a vector of the residual of each phenotype, yit. thus, the residual score vector for individual i is defined as:

 si*=si1si2~sit=b ^iv ^i-1{yi-μ^i}, 

where μ^i=g-1ziγ^ and γ^ is estimator obtained from estimating equations under the null hypothesis h0:β= <dig>  b ^i and v ^i are calculated using μ^i. based on this residual score vector, each individual with phenotypes is discriminated between case and control status. from the residual score vector for individual, we propose the aggregation for elements of the score vector, si= ∑j=1tsij, and use that as a prediction score for each individual. if the sum of prediction scores over those individuals who have the corresponding genotype combination is greater than a threshold value, assign 'high-risk' to the cell corresponding to the genotype combination. otherwise, assign 'low-risk' to the cell.

data
our primary outcomes are two types of blood pressure, systolic blood pressure  and diastolic blood pressure , and hypertension diagnosis of the korean association resource  consortium. the measurements of blood pressure were dichotomized at  <dig> mmhg for sbp and  <dig> mmhg for dbp, and denoted by sbpb and dbpb, respectively. we defined the hypertensive case as hp =  <dig> if sbp ≥  <dig> mmhg or dbp ≥  <dig> mmhg, and hp =  <dig>  otherwise. several genome-wide association studies  have been performed on blood pressure by treating blood pressure as a quantitative trait  <cit> . in this study, we treated blood pressure as a binary trait hp representing whether the hypertension status is yes or no. among  <dig>  kare subjects,  <dig>  subjects were removed in the analysis due to anti-hypertensive therapy and drug treatments that could influence blood pressure. additionally,  <dig> subjects were excluded because of missingness in sbp and body mass index . of the  <dig>  subjects considered in the study,  <dig>   subjects were from urban community ansan and the others were from rural community ansung. for the study, the average age is  <dig>  years for ansan and  <dig>  years for ansung. there are three times of bi-yearly measured hypertensive status from  <dig> to  <dig>  denoted by hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp <dig>  among  <dig>  subjects,  <dig>  subjects did not follow up at time  <dig> or  <dig>  subject characteristics are summarized in table  <dig>  the genomic dnas were genotyped using affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig> . the quality control procedures were adopted such as missing genotype frequency >  <dig> % and minor allele frequency  ≤  <dig>  at least on area. finally a total of  <dig>  individuals and  <dig>  snps were included in the analysis of dichotomized sbpb and dbpb, while a total of  <dig>  individuals and  <dig>  snps were included in the analysis of repeatedly measured hypertension status.

RESULTS
preliminary analyses
to compare multivariate analysis with univariate analysis, we first separately fit a logistic regression model for each dichotomized blood pressure measurement sbpb and dbpb with covariate adjustment for recruitment area, age, sex, and bmi. the correlation between sbpb and dbpb is  <dig> . the multivariate analysis with two binary phenotypes  was conducted using the gee approach. for the repeatedly measured hypertension status hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp <dig>  we fit logistic models for each hpi and fit the gee model for three hps simultaneously. the pairwise correlations range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in the gee model, we assumed two types of genetic effect: homogeneous genetic effect and heterogeneous genetic effect for multivariate phenotypes. however, when we compared the effect sizes and p-values of homogeneous model with those of heterogeneous model, there was no strong evidence for supporting the homogeneous genetic effect. so, we present the results of the gee model with heterogeneous genetic effects for multivariate phenotypes in both of blood pressures and repeatedly measured hypertension status.

to perform gene-gene interaction analysis using gmdr analyses, we first selected snps with strong marginal effects in univariate models and among those, we select the ones with strong effects in multivariate models. for sbpb and dbpb analysis, we selected the top  <dig> snps for each sbpb and dbpb. from these  <dig> snps, we chose  <dig> snps using a p-value criterion  from the gee model. in a similar manner, we chose  <dig> snps for hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp <dig> by selecting the top  <dig> snps for each hpi using the same p-value criterion from their gee model.

univariate logistic and multivariate gee analyses of sbpb and dbpb
we report results of gwa studies of dichotomized sbpb and dbpb, and their multivariate analyses. for sbpb and dbpb, the manhattan plots are given in figure  <dig>  as summarized in table  <dig>  five snps for sbpb  and three snps for dbpb  were selected at the 10- <dig> significance level. for multivariate gee analysis for , six snps were selected: rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  among these six snps selected from multivariate gee analysis, four snps were also found by univariate analysis but two snps  were not. a gene csk in which snp rs <dig> is located has been reported as a hypertension susceptibility gene in the korean population  <cit>  and also in east asians  <cit> .

univariate logistic and multivariate gee analyses of hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp3
we performed association analysis for the repeatedly measured binary hypertension phenotypes hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp <dig>  first, the logistic regression model was fit for each hpi and multivariate analysis for  was performed by gee model. manhattan plots are given in figure  <dig>  nineteen snps were selected at 10- <dig> significance level : four for hp <dig> , five for hp <dig> , and seven for hp <dig> , and three for multivariate hps . however, none of the identified snps were commonly observed by all three univariate analyses . it might be due to the fact that the status of subject with hypertension is very volatile over time  even though the proportion of hypertension risk was stable over time . thus the signals of association with hypertension were differently expressed over time. among three snps from multivariate analysis, snp rs <dig> was also associated with hypertension by univariate analysis at time  <dig>  however, there were no common snps between multivariate gee analysis and univariate analyses at times  <dig> and  <dig>  one hypertension snp at time  <dig>  rs <dig>  in fbn <dig> gene and another snp rs <dig> of wwox gene from multivariate have been previously found to be associated with hypertension in china population  <cit> .

note that numbers within parentheses are the number of hypertensive case at each time point.

univariate gmdr and multivariate gmdr analyses of sbpb and dbpb
we present gmdr results to discover gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions. for univariate gmdr analysis, logistic regression models for dichotomized sbpb and dbpb were constructed with area, age, sex, and bmi as covariates under the null hypothesis of no genetic effect. for multivariate gmdr analysis, the gee model with same covariates was constructed. to reduce the computational burden, we focused on  <dig> snps selected from the preliminary analysis. all possible one and two locus models were fit for  <dig> snps. through 10-fold-cross validation the best combination of loci with maximum train balanced accuracy  which is average of sensitivity and specificity was chosen at each fold. to choose the final model, we considered cross-validation consistency  among a set of best combinations.

univariate gmdr and multivariate gmdr analyses of hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp3
the results of the univariate gmdr and multivariate gmdr are summarized in table  <dig> for the repeatedly measured hypertension status hp <dig>  hp <dig>  and hp <dig>  for these hypertension phenotypes,  <dig> snps selected from the preliminary analysis were included to gmdr mechanisms. all possible one and two locus models were fit for  <dig> snps. not surprisingly, all different snps were identified in one-locus model. for the comparison between gmdr methods and classic method of logistic and gee models, we report the p-values from the logistic models and gee model for the identified snps from gmdr methods in one-locus models:  <dig> e- <dig> for hp <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> for hp <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> for hp <dig>  and  <dig> e- <dig> for multivariate phenotypes. the identified snps by gmdr methods also have significant p-values from the classic methods. the best two-locus model from multivariate gmdr included rs <dig> in ccdc <dig> gene and rs <dig> in wdr <dig> implying that the interaction between ccdc <dig> and wdr <dig> genes was identified as a significant contributor to the repeatedly measured hypertension status. box plots and density plots of test ba for gmdr and multivariate gmdr of hps are given in figure  <dig>  similar to the results of dichotomized sbpb and dbpb, the test ba for multivariate gmdr had a smaller deviation in the both one-and two-locus models.

comparison of univariate gmdr and multivariate gmdr
we presented the results of univariate and multivariate gmdr by the same phenotypes in the previous two sub-sessions. however, those comparisons are not significantly meaningful to describe the usefulness of multivariate gmdr. here, we compared the results from multivariate gmdr of sbpb and dbpb with the results from the gmdr of hp <dig> including the same individuals and candidate snps . because hypertension was defined by sbpb or dbpb, we can directly compare the performance of multivariate gmdr and univariate gmdr through those analyses. multivariate gmdr and gmdr yielded the same best two-locus model. however, multivariate gmdr shows slightly better test ba than gmdr. box plots of test ba for multivariate gmdr and gmdr from those two analyses are given in figure  <dig>  the test ba of multivariate model has smallest deviation also.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have developed multivariate analysis for discovering gene-gene interaction, namely multivariate gmdr. our multivariate gmdr analysis was developed by utilizing a gee approach to multivariate phenotypes. many studies emphasized the importance and the increase of power for multivariate analysis in gwas  <cit> . although mdr method has been developed in variety of manners  <cit> , there have been no extensions to the multivariate analysis. we proposed multivariate gmdr analysis by utilizing the gee model to calculate the prediction score to be a tool for reducing the multifactor dimensionality. the gee approach is an extension of generalized linear models to the longitudinal data and handles both discrete and continuous phenotypes. thus, our multivariate gmdr can be applicable to both discrete and continuous phenotypes.

though real gwas data analysis, we investigated the properties of multivariate gmdr. firstly, the result of multivariate gmdr does not always coincide with that of gee approach. that is, the best snp set selected by multivariate gmdr does not always have the smallest p-value from gee model. in our analysis, note that the snp set selected by multivariate gmdr still tends to have quite a small p-value. secondly, the test bas of the multivariate gmdr is not always larger than those of univariate gmdr. as shown in figures  <dig> to  <dig>  the distribution of test bas from the multivariate gmdr is different from those of univariate gmdr. the test bas of multivariate gmdr are more densely distributed with a smaller standard deviation than those of univariate gmdr. thus, a direct comparison of test bas between multivariate gmdr and univariate gmdr may lead a misleading conclusion.

the proposed multivariate gmdr can be extended in many different ways. the modified version bas which takes account for the distributional difference is expected to improve the performance of multivariate gmdr. the testing procedure using the modified bas under the null distribution would enable us to demonstrate the increase of power of multivariate gmdr. a prediction score is defined as the sum of elements of the score vector from gee model. we are currently working on several different weighting schemes for accounting various relationships between phenotypes. the weighted prediction score is also expected to improve the performance of multivariate gmdr. in the future studies, all these extensions will be evaluated through extensive simulation studies.
