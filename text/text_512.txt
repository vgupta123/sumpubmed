BACKGROUND
natural variation in disease resistance conferred by pathogen specific r-genes has been essential for the evolution of innate immunity in plants . the most common class of plant r-genes encodes receptor-like proteins containing a highly conserved nucleotide-binding site  and a variable leucine-rich repeat  region, which enable detection of effector proteins that are introduced into the host cytoplasm by an infecting pathogen. balancing selection is predicted to be important in maintaining different resistance alleles to recognise diverse, coevolving pathogens  <cit> . characteristic signatures of balancing selection have been observed in many r-gene examples, including elevated levels of heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity and amino acid diversity, and reduced genetic structure across populations .

however, signatures of balancing selection were only detected in seven out of  <dig> loci in a comprehensive study of r-genes in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , suggesting that other types of selection or neutral demographic processes could affect allelic variation of plant r-genes. for example, genetic drift can be important in driving patterns of genetic polymorphism at adaptive loci in populations with fragmented distributions across landscapes  <cit> . spatial and temporal heterogeneity in selection pressures from pathogens may maintain variation in r-genes, but make clear signatures of selection difficult to detect . past demographic history and mating system variation could also substantially impact genetic variation at both neutral and adaptive loci. for example, population bottlenecks and postglacial recolonisation patterns have shaped genetic diversity patterns across species  <cit> , and inbreeding is expected to reduce heterozygosity and diversity and increase differentiation among populations  <cit> . in flowering plants, a shift from outcrossing to selfing is one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions  <cit> , with selfing lineages, both within and between species, showing the predicted reduction in genetic variation . however, balancing selection at r-genes could maintain elevated levels of heterozygosity and diversity in inbred lineages, as observed at animal immune genes  <cit> .

the current understanding of natural variation in plant r-genes has mostly been based on sampling one or a few plants  per population of the selfing, annual plant a. thaliana from across its range  <cit> . recent studies of r-gene variation in a. lyrata, a close perennial relative of a. thaliana, revealed evidence for adaptive divergence at putative r-genes among geographically distant populations, but also an accumulation of major-effect mutations suggesting relaxed selection  <cit> . the effects of mating system have also been considered in comparisons of other brassicaceae species, where reduced variation was found in the selfing species capsella rubella at five of nine studied r-genes when compared to its outcrossing relative c. grandiflora  <cit> , with similar patterns of polymorphism at neutral loci  <cit> . however, interspecific comparisons of outcrossing and selfing taxa potentially confound mating system shifts with additional changes associated with speciation. further investigation of how intraspecific variation in mating system may impact r-gene evolution could provide a more direct test of the relative impacts of mating system shifts and population structure on adaptive genetic diversity. for this, fine-scale sampling of local populations is important to understand the evolutionary processes shaping adaptive loci within and among populations  <cit> .

arabidopsis lyrata is an herbaceous perennial that is predominantly outcrossing across its range. this species has distinct postglacial patterns of neutral polymorphism and structure across europe  and north america , with clear divergence between these lineages  <cit> . a. l. petraea, is found throughout northern and central europe in small populations thought to represent glacial refugia  <cit> , resulting in strong genetic structure within and among geographic regions, and particularly high levels of neutral genetic polymorphism in central european populations  <cit> . a. l. lyrata has strong population structure in eastern north america  and reduced levels of polymorphism relative to a. l. petraea  <cit> . multiple transitions from outcrossing to selfing have been observed, particularly around the great lakes region, where populations vary from highly outcrossing to highly selfing . a. lyrata therefore provides the opportunity to assess how population structure at multiple scales  and mating system will impact variation at adaptive loci, such as r-genes.

in this study, we focused on two nbs-lrr proteins that confer resistance in a. thaliana to common biotrophic pathogens of the brassicaceae: rpm <dig>   <cit>  and wrr <dig>   <cit> . in a. thaliana, rpm <dig> is a single copy gene for which functional alleles have been identified that recognise at least two different effector proteins of the bacterium pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . this gene has been evolving by recurrent loss-of-function alleles, including major-effect mutations and deletion of the entire coding sequence  <cit> . variation in presence or absence of these alleles has been considered a balanced polymorphism and so the gene has been predicted to evolve under strong balancing selection  <cit> . selection for multiple loss-of-function alleles suggests a cost of rpm1-mediated resistance in the absence of disease pressure  <cit> , despite p. syringae being a ubiquitous inhabitant of plant leaves  <cit> . wrr <dig> is one of three genes in a cluster that provides broad spectrum resistance in a. thaliana to white blister rust, caused by the biotrophic oomycete, albugo candida  <cit> . a. candida is a global parasite that occurs as different pathotypes on brassica crops and wild brassicaceae species . however, there have been no previous studies of within or between population variation at wrr <dig> so it has not been tested whether the gene is under balancing or diversifying selection.

to test whether selection acting at the resistance loci can be detected above demographic processes, we compared patterns of genetic variation at these two r-genes in a. lyrata to those observed at genome-wide restriction associated dna  loci and neutral microsatellites. moreover, we specifically asked whether intensive within-population sampling will alter perspectives on r-gene dynamics, compared to results from the broader-scale sampling used in most previous studies  <cit> . we addressed two questions: 1) at a fine spatial scale, how does population structure, mating system variation and selection shape patterns of polymorphism within and among a. l. lyrata populations around the great lakes region? specifically, we predicted that if the r-genes are under balancing selection this would result in higher heterozygosity and diversity, but reduced genetic structure among populations, relative to that observed at neutral microsatellites and rad loci. alternatively, directional selection at r-genes would reduce estimates of diversity and heterozygosity, and increase genetic differentiation, relative to neutral expectations. 2) at a broader geographic scale, how do subspecies divergence and selection shape patterns of polymorphism across subspecies of a. lyrata? here, we predicted that balancing selection would result in increased allele sharing between the subspecies  and that we would again observe an increase in heterozygosity and diversity but a reduction in genetic differentiation, relative to neutral expectations.

methods
sample collection and dna extraction
from the great lakes region, we focused on  <dig> diploid a. l. lyrata populations  that show variation in mating system . in  <dig>  we sampled seven outcrossing , two selfing  and one mixed mating  population . to assess pathogen incidence, leaf tissue was sampled in early may when sand dune habitats are at their wettest and there is extensive green tissue available for pathogens to invade; the same sites were revisited in july to sample seeds. samples were collected no closer than 5 m apart  along previously established transects  <cit> . green leaf tissue collected in  <dig> from a selfing population on the bruce peninsula  was also included.fig.  <dig> maps of the distribution of wrr <dig> and rpm <dig> haplotypes in a. l. lyrata around the north american great lakes. geographic distribution of  <dig> arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata sampling sites in the north american great lakes region showing variation in the dominant mating system at each site  and the haplotype frequencies at two disease resistance loci : a) mating system variation, with black circles indicating outcrossing populations , grey circles indicating a mixed-mating population  and white circles indicating selfing populations ; b) piecharts showing the frequency of the  <dig> haplotypes for rpm <dig> ; c) frequency of three rpm <dig> haplotypes containing major effect mutations: a premature stop codon mutation , a null genotype  and a 9 bp deletion ; all other haplotypes for which no major effect mutation was detected  and d). piecharts showing the frequency in each population of the  <dig> haplotypes found for wrr <dig> , with each colour indicating a different haplotype



to extend the geographic range for r-gene sequencing, dna extracted for a previous study  <cit>  was included for seven other populations . to allow comparison of neutral genetic variation with outcrossing rates based on a larger set of individuals per population, microsatellite genotypes  were generated for the  <dig> samples and data from the same set of loci  <cit>  were used for the seven other populations . for rad genotyping, four individuals per population were grown from seed from each of the  <dig> populations sampled in  <dig>  as well as from three other selfing populations  collected in other years . seeds were not available from hdc, pic, puk and was and therefore these populations were not genotyped using rad-seq.

to assay variation across a broader-scale in a. lyrata, we obtained samples from diploid european populations collected by other researchers . samples were provided by marcus koch , philippine vergeer , and elizabeth bourne . since few individuals were sampled per population and the aim was to compare variation with that in the great lakes region, sample sizes are reported per country .

seeds were germinated and grown in a growth cabinet , leaves sampled and then immediately dried using drierite dessicant . dried leaves were sent to the john innes centre , where dna was extracted using the qiagen dneasy  <dig> plant kit . for rad sequencing, dried tissue was disrupted using a fastprep machine and fastprep lysing matrix a tubes  and then dna extracted using dneasy spin columns. multiple dna extractions per individual were pooled to obtain the quantity of dna required for library preparation. dna quantification and quality checks were performed using the nanodrop nd <dig>  qubit  <dig>  fluorometer  and 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis.

pathogen frequency in a. l. lyrata populations around the north american great lakes
all  <dig> individuals from the  <dig> populations where leaves were field-collected in spring  <dig>  were screened for the presence of the pathogens associated with the two resistance genes, using a diagnostic pcr test . any samples testing positive for a pathogen or showing faint bands  were re-tested to confirm presence. if the parasite-specific band was subsequently not amplified, then the test was repeated a third time to confirm presence/absence. in all cases, a negative pcr control was used, in addition to a positive control for that pathogen.

the presence of albugo sp.  was tested using primers published by choi et al.  <cit> , targeting the cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii  region of mtdna . a positive a. candida control isolate  from the university of warwick, uk was added to each pcr run. the presence of a host-specific pcr product for the its primers was used as an internal control to ensure dna was of good quality. the presence of pseudomonas sp.  was tested using ps-for/ps-rev primers  <cit> , targeting a region of the 16 s rrna gene specific to this bacterial genus . any positive pcr bands were purified using exosap-it  and sent for direct sequencing , with sequence identity confirmed by blast.

r-gene sequencing
a fragment in the lrr region of rpm <dig> was amplified using published primers  <cit>  . for wrr <dig>  primers were designed from conserved regions in exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> based on alignment of a. thaliana coding sequences with the corresponding region of two contigs extracted from the a. l. lyrata reference genome  <cit> . we compared variation at all four exons using a subset of the individuals used for rad sequencing, along with sequences from a pilot study using additional north american sequences . variation in exon  <dig> was consistent with the amplification of a single gene copy and heterozygotes could be resolved using direct sequencing due to lack of indels, so this exon was chosen for screening. by contrast, exon  <dig> showed evidence of amplification of paralogs, exon  <dig> was not polymorphic, and exon  <dig>  was highly polymorphic, but showed inconsistent amplification across samples.

pcr products were cleaned using exosap-it  and sent to edinburgh genomics  for sequencing in both directions . the strategy used to check sequence quality, resolve the phase for heterozygotes, and identify haplotypes is outlined in supporting information.

genome-wide snp genotyping using rad-seq
to set a neutral context for patterns of polymorphism and genetic structure for comparison with those resolved at the r-genes, we used single-end rad sequencing data generated as part of a separate study for samples from europe  and the north america great lakes region . extracted dna was sent to the sequencing facility, edinburgh genomics  for preparation of libraries for rad-sequencing. genomic dna was digested using psti, a frequent cutting enzyme that is not sensitive to methylation. each individual was tagged using barcodes differing by at least 2 bp. digestion by psti was estimated to produce  <dig> rad loci for the 207 mb a. lyrata genome. three psti libraries were then generated for each of the two sample sets  and then each sequenced using one lane of an illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencer at edinburgh genomics . raw 100 bp reads were demultiplexed using their individual barcodes. fastqc  was used to check read quality within individuals and count total reads per individual. reads were filtered to remove those with uncalled bases and those of low quality using process_radtags  and each read was trimmed to 92 bp to remove the id tags.

reads were aligned to the arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata reference genome  using bowtie version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . default bowtie parameters were used to align reads to the eight chromosomes of a. lyrata, ~ 197mbp  <cit> , ignoring extrachromosomal regions . reads that aligned to more than one location were excluded from the alignment, so only those aligning uniquely to one location were retained. stacks v <dig>   <cit>  was then used to process the aligned reads, assemble rad loci and identify snps across each of the  <dig> individuals. stacks uses a multinomial-based likelihood model for identifying snps for diploid organisms  <cit> .

to establish a neutral background set of loci, for which heterozygotes could confidently be called, only loci with a minimum coverage of  <dig> reads and present in all individuals across both europe and north america were retained for analyses. although this set may include loci under selection, we expected that these would represent a low proportion of the total, so observed patterns would represent the genome-wide background. this resulted in inclusion of  <dig> loci that could be reliably compared across subspecies. the proportion of heterozygous loci  per individual was calculated by counting the number of rad loci heterozygous for a 92 bp haplotype using the ‘haplotypes.tsv’ output file produced by stacks. nucleotide diversity was estimated as the average number of nucleotide differences for all pairwise comparisons of sequences within a sample group , averaged across all rad loci and divided by the length of the rad sequence . this results in a statistic that is comparable to the estimate of nucleotide diversity produced by dnasp for the r-genes  <cit> .

presence-absence polymorphism genotyping in the r-genes
since r-genes are often characterised by presence-absence polymorphisms, 11– <dig> samples per population from a. l. lyrata were screened for amplification of pcr products of the size predicted for each target gene. “null” alleles were identified by the absence of a pcr product from an individual for a particular r-gene, but the presence of pcr products for the other r-gene and a host-specific its product  in the same individual. the pcr was repeated twice for confirmation . alternative primer sets for rpm <dig>  were designed and tested to confirm results.

analysing patterns of polymorphism and selection within a. l. lyrata
for each of the r-genes, individuals were classified as heterozygous or homozygous based on the whole sequence and the proportion of heterozygous individuals estimated for each population . individuals showing no amplification products were classified as null homozygotes. nucleotide diversity, defined as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between two sequences  <cit> , across all sites and at synonymous and non-synonymous sites separately, was calculated within each population using dnasp version  <dig>  <cit> , with deletions and gaps excluded. variation in the spatial distribution and frequency of rpm <dig> and wrr <dig> haplotypes were visualised as pie charts in relation to population location.

tajima’s d statistic  <cit>  was estimated for each population using dnasp. a binomial test using r statistical software  <cit>  was used to test for an excess of positive d values compared to negative across the  <dig> a. l. lyrata populations.

mcdonald-kreitman tests  <cit>  were conducted in dnasp to compare the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions between a. l. lyrata and a. thaliana   to the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous differences within a. l. lyrata . an excess of non-synonymous substitutions within species relative to between species would be consistent with balancing selection, whereas an excess of non-synonymous substitutions between species is a signature of directional selection.

balancing selection is also predicted to produce weaker patterns of genetic structure at adaptive loci relative to that estimated for neutral loci, whereas directional selection is predicted to increase structure among populations  <cit> . mantel tests with  <dig>  permutations were conducted using the r package “vegan”  <cit>  to first test for associations between genetic and geographic distance among populations  for microsatellites , rad loci  and r-genes. regressions of population-pairwise genetic differentiation for r-genes and neutral loci on pairwise geographic distance were then performed using the multiple regression on distance matrices function in the r package “ecodist”  <cit> . by estimating the slope of the regression line and its significance, we could test whether r-genes showed shallower slopes  than those estimated using eight microsatellites and rad loci. finally, mantel tests were used to test whether pairwise fst at r-genes was associated with neutral pairwise genetic structure as estimated by microsatellites and rad loci. for all pairs of populations we estimated pairwise fst  <cit>  for the r-genes using dnasp ; for the eight microsatellite loci using genepop  <cit> , using the weir & cockerham  <cit>  fst estimator and for each rad locus using stacks v <dig>   and averaging across all loci to produce an average pairwise fst. gps coordinates  were converted to decimal degrees and population pairwise geographic distance  matrices were produced using the r package ‘fossil’  <cit> .

testing for effects of mating system in a. l. lyrata
we compared differences in individual heterozygosity estimated using eight microsatellites and rad-seq to patterns observed at the two r-genes. differences in individual heterozygosity between outcrossing and selfing populations  were tested using generalised linear mixed effects models with a fixed factor of mating system and population as a random factor. as described in the methods, the same individuals were genotyped for both r-genes, but different individuals  were genotyped at microsatellite and rad loci. analyses were implemented using the r package ‘lme4’  <cit>  using a binomial error distribution for microsatellites and rad loci  and the r-genes . a quasibinomial error distribution was used where over-dispersion was observed. likelihood-ratio tests were used to test for a significant change in the log-likelihood of a model on removal of each factor of interest.

a generalised linear model with poisson error with fixed effect of mating system  was used to test whether more haplotypes were observed in outcrossing than selfing populations.

in the absence of selection, relationships between outcrossing rate  and observed heterozygosity  or nucleotide diversity would be predicted to be similar for the r-genes and neutral markers. linear regressions were therefore conducted to test whether estimates of tm  significantly predicted: 1) population-level average ho for microsatellites, rad loci and the two r-genes; 2) nucleotide diversity at rad-seq loci and the r-genes; and 3) synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide diversity for the r-genes.

analysing patterns of polymorphism and selection across subspecies
for assessment of broad-scale variation across subspecies, we compared rpm <dig> and wrr <dig> variation among a. l. petraea samples with a subset of the  <dig> outcrossing a. l. lyrata populations . haplotype networks were generated using an infinite site model in the pegas r package  <cit> . haplotype networks indicating relative frequencies were generated for each subspecies separately. to test for evidence of trans-specific polymorphism , a network not scaled by frequency was then used to visualise haplotype sharing among subspecies.

to confirm previous observations that a. l. lyrata shows lower diversity and heterozygosity than a. l. petraea, nucleotide diversity and heterozygosity for samples grouped by country of origin were calculated for the rad loci . given that observed heterozygosity estimates averaged across rad loci are not directly comparable to observed heterozygosity at a single r- gene sequence, we did not compare absolute values of observed heterozygosity, but rather focused on the relative differences in heterozygosity among the sample groups. specifically, estimates for r-genes were compared to the rad loci to examine whether r-gene diversity and heterozygosity is similarly reduced in a. l. lyrata relative to a. l petraea; assumed if they are evolving neutrally. the percentage difference in observed heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity for each european country relative to the a. l. lyrata outcrossing subset was also calculated for both r-genes and all rad loci to visualise the relative differences between countries and loci. a glm with binomial error  was also conducted to statistically test for reduced individual heterozygosity in a. l. lyrata relative to a. l. petraea. the change in model deviance on removal of the fixed effect of subspecies was tested using a likelihood ratio test.

to test for selection, the datamonkey server , which implements statistical tests associated with the programme hyphy  <cit> , was used to conduct codon-based tests for selection using the r-gene haplotype alignments for both a. l. petraea and a. l. lyrata. specifically, codons showing an excess of non-synonymous variants relative to synonymous variants  or an excess of synonymous mutations  were used. the methods employed are tree-based methods that compare the rate of nonsynonymous changes per nonsynonymous site to synonymous changes per synonymous site such that ratios greater than one are indicative of positive selection and ratios less than one indicative of purifying selection. the program codontest  <cit>  was first used to choose the best fitting substitution model and then three different codon-based tests were compared to identify signatures of selection . slac  estimates the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes at each codon, fel  fits substitution rate models on a site-by-site basis and rel  uses a distribution of substitution rates to model variation across sites. rel is the least conservative and so can provide an indication of sites potentially under selection. meme  was also used to detect episodes of periodic selection across the phylogeny, in addition to diversifying selection. mcdonald-kreitman tests were also conducted for a. l. petraea compared to a. thaliana, for comparison with the a. l. lyrata results.

RESULTS
pathogen frequency in a. l. lyrata populations around the north american great lakes
pcr screening of host tissues from  <dig> individuals collected in the spring  <dig> revealed that albugo sp. were present at very low frequency in natural populations around the great lakes. direct sequencing and blast revealed that just one individual in the sak population, located towards the southern end of lake michigan , was infected with albugo. the individual with albugo showed no symptoms of disease infection .

pseudomonas-specific pcr products were amplified at high frequency in the ten populations sampled in the spring of  <dig> , but were detected at much lower frequency in the tc and tca populations collected in july of  <dig> . however, inferring potential selection pressures by pathogenic pseudomonas sp. was complicated by the amplification of multiple products in the pcr reactions; cloning and sequencing indicated that the 16s region used was not variable enough to distinguish pathogenic, epiphytic and symbiotic pseudomonas species. of  <dig> samples collected in spring  <dig> for which sequence quality was good, a wide range of pseudomonas sp. were identified, with  <dig> samples containing sequences identified as p. syringae, but further identification of pathovars was not possible.

presence-absence polymorphism in the r-genes
rpm <dig> sequence was amplified in a majority of samples , except for nine out of  <dig> individuals sampled from one of the outcrossing populations . a second set of rpm <dig> primers  was used to confirm null amplifications. wrr <dig> sequence was amplified in all but three individuals from two neighbouring inbreeding populations ; these individuals also showed lack of amplification using primers located in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  individuals with no pcr amplification could reflect null alleles because its <dig> and the other r-genes were successfully amplified from the dna.

patterns of polymorphism and selection within a. l. lyrata
amongst  <dig> a. l. lyrata samples,  <dig> rpm <dig> haplotypes were identified which differed at  <dig> nucleotide sites, in addition to a 9 bp deletion at position 966–975 bp, across the 984 bp alignment. the number of rpm <dig> haplotypes per population ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and varied in frequency across populations . outcrossing populations had on average  <dig> × more haplotypes than selfing populations . geographic clustering of haplotypes containing major effect mutations was observed, including: a haplotype containing the nine base-pair deletion at >50 % frequency in three of the four populations bordering lake huron ; and a haplotype with an in-frame stop-codon  at >63 % frequency around lake erie . both haplotypes were observed at lower frequencies in other regions .table  <dig> patterns of polymorphism within and among north american great lakes populations of a. l. lyrata at both rpm <dig> and wrr4

at wrr <dig>   <dig> haplotypes were observed amongst  <dig> individuals and these differed at  <dig> sites in the 909 bp alignment. this included one haplotype with a 2 bp deletion and another containing a mutation to a stop codon , which was homozygous in a single individual from the pcr population. the number of haplotypes per population ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  and limited regional clustering of alleles was observed , although one haplotype was shared at high frequency across multiple populations . outcrossing populations had on average  <dig> × more haplotypes than selfing populations .

across the great lakes, the proportion of heterozygous individuals and nucleotide diversity varied extensively across populations but was generally similar between the two r-genes . the selfing lpt population consistently showed the lowest nucleotide diversity and heterozygosity for both rpm <dig> and wrr <dig>  synonymous nucleotide diversity was equal to or greater than non-synonymous diversity for  <dig> of the  <dig> populations for both r-genes. for wrr <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> populations had positive tajima’s d values  and for rpm <dig>  <dig> of  <dig> populations had positive d values . within populations, significantly positive d values were found only for ptp at wrr <dig> and ron at rpm <dig>  which suggests a significantly higher proportion of variants at intermediate frequency than expected based on neutral predictions. in most other populations the majority of haplotypes were observed at low frequency for both rpm <dig> and wrr <dig> . mcdonald kreitman tests suggested no evidence for an excess of non-synonymous substitutions within a. l. lyrata or between a. l. lyrata and a. thaliana at rpm <dig>  or wrr <dig> .

no evidence for isolation by distance was observed with the microsatellites ,  <dig> rad loci  or wrr <dig> , but rpm <dig> showed a weakly significant association between genetic and geographic distance . regressions of r-gene genetic distance and geographic distance also showed that variation in geographic distance did not predict variation in genetic distance  for either of the r-genes  or neutral loci . the slopes of the regression lines were similar for both r-genes  and neutral loci , suggesting selection is not shaping genetic structure among the north american great lakes populations.

pairwise fst for both rpm <dig> and wrr <dig> were significantly positively associated with pairwise genetic structure estimated using neutral microsatellites ; genetic structure at the two r-genes was also significantly correlated . this result is supported using the  <dig> rad loci; pairwise genetic structure averaged across rad loci  was significantly correlated with genetic structure at both r-genes , and with pairwise neutral genetic distance estimated by the eight microsatellites .fig.  <dig> pairwise genetic distance mantel correlations between microsatellites,  <dig> rad loci and both r-genes. pairwise genetic distance mantel correlations between: a) rpm <dig> and eight neutral microsatellites, b) wrr <dig> and eight neutral microsatellites, c)

effects of mating system in a. l. lyrata
average observed heterozygosity  as estimated by microsatellites was  <dig> × higher for outcrossing populations when compared to selfing populations , as has been found previously  <cit> . similarly, ho was  <dig> × higher in outcrossing populations across the  <dig> rad loci shared among all individuals, as well as  <dig> × and  <dig> × higher for rpm <dig> and wrr <dig> respectively, compared to selfing populations. by contrast, nucleotide diversity across rad loci was  <dig> × higher in outcrossing relative to selfing populations, but only  <dig> × and  <dig> × higher in outcrossing populations for rpm <dig> and wrr <dig>  respectively .

glm analyses showed significantly higher individual observed heterozygosity in outcrossing than selfing populations at both rad and microsatellite loci , and at the two r-genes .

population outcrossing rates  significantly predicted variation in observed heterozygosity for both rad loci  and microsatellites . similarly, outcrossing rates significantly explained a high proportion of the variation in population-level average ho at rpm <dig>  and wrr <dig> . population-level outcrossing rates also significantly predicted variation in nucleotide diversity for rad loci  and rpm <dig> , but not for wrr <dig> . the same pattern was found when synonymous diversity was considered separately but outcrossing rates did not significantly predict variation in non-synonymous diversity at either r-gene .fig.  <dig> associations between population-level outcrossing rates and observed heterozygosity at rad loci and r-genes in a. l. lyrata regressions of population-level outcrossing rates, tm  on observed heterozygosity in a. l. lyrata for: a)  <dig> rad loci; b) eight microsatellites; and two disease resistance genes, c) rpm <dig> and d) wrr <dig>  the significance  of the linear regression of population average outcrossing rate on observed heterozygosity is given, along with the linear equation describing the relationship

patterns of polymorphism and selection across subspecies
among the european samples , no null alleles were identified for rpm <dig>  but four null genotypes were found for wrr <dig> in the austrian and german populations tested . for rpm <dig>  three norwegian samples contained an in-frame stop codon mutation  at position 661–663 bp but no major effect mutations were observed for wrr <dig> in a. l. petraea. european samples added an additional  <dig> haplotypes for rpm <dig> and  <dig> haplotypes for wrr <dig>  but at rpm <dig>  a high frequency allele found among the great lakes a. l. lyrata samples also occurred at high frequency  in the a. l. petraea samples . for wrr <dig>  although there were no shared haplotypes between subspecies, there were single-step mutations derived in both directions .fig.  <dig> haplotype networks in arabidopsis lyrata produced by the pegas r package  <cit>  for rpm <dig>  and wrr <dig>  with circles either unscaled  or scaled by relative frequency . black circles indicate european haplotypes and grey indicates north american ; coloured circles indicate different countries  or sampling sites  in the other plots. n indicates the number of sequences included. the rpm <dig> haplotype shared between european and great lakes samples  is indicated as ‘hap 8’ in b) and c). in d) the black and grey arrows denote the most frequent haplotype as observed in europe and great lakes respectively



a. l. petraea individuals had significantly higher observed heterozygosity  at rad-seq loci than a. l. lyrata outcrossing individuals , with estimates of ho > <dig>  % higher in each european country relative to that observed in outcrossing a. l. lyrata . by contrast, rpm <dig> showed no significant overall difference in ho between the subspecies . however, ho at rpm <dig> was >89 % higher in austria and germany relative to a. l. lyrata, , but consistently lower in scandinavian countries and scotland . interestingly, for wrr <dig> the proportion of heterozygous individuals was on average higher in outcrossing a. l. lyrata than in a. l. petraea samples . however, the german population showed particularly reduced levels of wrr <dig> heterozygosity , possibly influenced by the presence of null alleles; when german samples were removed there was no difference between subspecies .table  <dig> observed heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity across european a. l. petraea and n. american a. l. lyrata outcrossing samples at  <dig> rad loci, rpm <dig> and wrr4

for nucleotide diversity, variation at rad loci was consistently higher in a. l. petraea than in a. l. lyrata , with estimates of π > <dig>  % higher in each european country relative to that observed in outcrossing a. l. lyrata . by contrast, nucleotide diversity at rpm <dig> in european a. l. petraea populations was not consistently higher than in outcrossing a. l. lyrata . synonymous nucleotide diversity was higher than non-synonymous for the north american samples and all european countries, except iceland . at wrr <dig>  nucleotide diversity was > <dig>  % higher in a. l. petraea relative to outcrossing a. l. lyrata, except for samples from sweden , which had  <dig> × lower nucleotide diversity than observed for other european countries. synonymous nucleotide diversity was at least  <dig> × higher than non-synonymous diversity for all groups . nucleotide diversity values for both r-genes across all european samples and n. american outcrossing samples were similar to the mean nucleotide diversity across rad loci for each group  and fell within the frequency distribution of nucleotide diversity values for all rad loci when plotted separately for all european samples and all n. american outcrossing samples .

for rpm <dig>  positive  selection was detected at one codon by both the rel and fel methods and meme detected an additional site under episodic diversifying selection . however, there were  <dig> sites where negative selection was detected, with two found in all three analyses that tested this . for wrr <dig> evidence for positive selection was found at two codons using both the rel and fel methods , but the meme analyses suggested that one of these was actually under episodic selection . nine sites were found to be under purifying selection, with four detected by all three analyses.

mcdonald kreitman tests comparing a. l. petraea and a. thaliana showed that ratios of the number of synonymous and non-synsonymous mutations fixed or polymorphic within species did not significantly differ at rpm <dig> . however, at wrr <dig> there was evidence for significantly elevated proportion of non-synonymous mutations fixed between species .

discussion
polymorphism at r-genes can be associated with resistance and susceptibility to particular pathogens, so it is important to understand how selection and neutral processes shape patterns of variation at these loci. to date most studies of r-gene variation in natural populations have focused on among population sampling of the annual, selfing plant a. thaliana  <cit> . however, mating system and local selection pressures can vary among taxa and populations and can shape patterns of neutral genetic variation  <cit> . finer-scale sampling of related taxa may therefore be important for identifying such effects on putatively adaptive genes. the results presented here highlight the complexity of factors influencing the evolutionary dynamics of plant r-genes in natural populations.

patterns of polymorphism and selection within a. l. lyrata 
for the north american populations sampled , we found less presence-absence variation  at rpm <dig> than expected based on genome-wide pav patterns observed in a. thaliana  <cit> . in a. thaliana, the fitness cost of a functional rpm <dig> allele  <cit>  has been predicted to maintain high frequencies of null alleles and major effect mutations at this locus  <cit> . interestingly, only one outcrossing population  was found with individuals carrying a null rpm <dig> allele  at relatively high frequency . we also found two major effect rpm <dig> mutations, which showed strong geographic structuring, with one occurring at more than 50 % frequency in three populations around lake huron and another occurring at more than 63 % frequency in four populations on lake erie .

the accumulation of mutations of putatively major effect on protein function has also been observed at two other r-genes in the ind and ron a. l. lyrata populations  <cit> . whether this is due to a relaxation of pathogen-mediated selection pressure or balancing selection maintaining variation, is difficult to establish. in order to test this, we assessed prevalence of the target pathogens for each of the r-genes. although we found pseudomonas species to be present at high frequency across the great lakes , as observed in other natural plant populations , we could not determine the frequency of pathogenic isolates because of the lack of discrimination between species at the its locus used for detection. additional pcr screening for the presence of pathogenic avirulence factors  may help identify potentially pathogenic pseudomonas. however, the known pathogenic isolates of pseudomonas in a. thaliana under laboratory conditions might be unable to cause symptoms and disease pressure in a natural environment on a related arabidopsis species.

wrr <dig> also shows pav in a. thaliana , but in a. l. lyrata we found null genotypes in only a few individuals from two selfing populations on lake erie. we expected the target pathogen, albugo candida, to be present in the great lakes region, based on a previous report by jacobson et al.  <cit>  of widespread asymptomatic infection of a. l. lyrata. however, they found symptomatic infections only at sak, where we also detected the pathogen in a single individual using the same pcr-based approach. high frequency of susceptibility in a. l. lyrata from north american sites to different pathovars of a. candida has been observed , which suggests that wrr <dig> alleles able to recognise albugo pathovars might be absent in this geographically defined subspecies of a. lyrata.

sampling in one season prevents robust predictions about pathogen pressures and long-term dynamics of r-genes, but the results of our molecular genetic analyses are consistent with the absence of strong pathogen-mediated selection pressures for either of the target pathogens around the great lakes. statistical tests for selection including tajima’s d  or mcdonald kreitman tests  also showed no evidence for selection in a. l. lyrata and an excess of synonymous compared to nonsynomymous mutations in most populations . furthermore, for both r-genes we found that population pairwise fst were significantly associated with genetic structure at neutral markers , suggesting that neutral population genetic structure, specifically postglacial expansion patterns, has played a stronger role than balancing or directional selection in shaping patterns of variation at these r-genes in a. l. lyrata.

effects of mating system in a. l. lyrata
balancing selection predicts the maintenance of higher levels of diversity and heterozygosity at adaptive loci in inbred lineages than observed at neutral markers  <cit> , as observed at two of nine r-genes in the selfing capsella rubella  <cit> . for n. american a. l. lyrata we found that observed heterozygosity at rad loci, neutral microsatellites and the r-genes were significantly explained by variation in population outcrossing rates . outcrossing populations also tended to have a higher number of haplotypes than selfing populations . interestingly, nucleotide diversity was significantly explained by outcrossing rates at rad loci and rpm <dig> , but not wrr <dig> , with high polymorphism maintained in several of the inbred populations . this could reflect the postglacial colonisation of this region by multiple lineages with divergent haplotypes independent of the dominant mating system, as suggested previously  <cit> , but may also be consistent with balancing selection. since the great lakes region was colonised within the last  <dig>  years, recent bottlenecks and gene flow among lineages arising from independent colonisation events could reduce signatures of selection. furthermore, a lack of variation in inbred lineages might reduce the potential to detect differences in polymorphism resulting from selection. we therefore added a broad-scale perspective to identify signatures of selection by comparing a. l. lyrata with geographically distinct european populations.

patterns of polymorphism and selection across subspecies
a. l. petraea shows clear divergence from a. l. lyrata  <cit>  and distinct postglacial patterns of neutral polymorphism and structure have been observed among geographic regions  <cit> . this was supported by our genome-wide rad sequencing data, which showed higher diversity in a. l. petraea populations relative to outcrossing a. l. lyrata . higher levels of polymorphism in a. l. petraea should increase our power to test for signatures of selection on the r-genes. comparing subspecies also allows us to test for “trans-subspecific” polymorphism, in terms of allele sharing among divergent lineages  <cit> . our results were broadly consistent with balancing selection: 1) patterns of polymorphism at the r-genes showed less of a distinction between the subspecies than observed for rad loci , which results from higher levels of observed heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity in outcrossing a. l. lyrata than expected; and 2) the sharing of a high frequency haplotype between european and north american populations for rpm <dig> . although no haplotypes were identical between regions for wrr <dig>  there were several haplotypes that only differed by a single base pair . together, these results suggest that broad-scale sampling across subspecies identified clearer signatures of selection than finer-scale sampling in a limited geographic region. our sampling in europe was comparable to previous broad-scale studies in a. thaliana , suggesting that sampling more populations with fewer individuals per population might be most informative for identifying selection.

tests for selection based on nucleotide polymorphism and comparisons to a. thaliana  did not show significant deviations from neutrality for rpm <dig>  but did show a significant excess of non-synonymous polymorphisms fixed between species for wrr <dig>  which is a signature of adaptive fixation of advantageous mutations  <cit> . for both rpm <dig> and wrr <dig>  codon-based tests for selection identified two sites under positive selection and a greater number of codons under purifying selection . within a. l. petraea, the observed excess of synonymous diversity in all polymorphic populations  also suggests an important role of purifying selection at these loci. pathogen presence was not screened for the european populations used here, because leaf samples were obtained at the same time as seed collections when presence of pathogens might be expected to be lower, because there is more investment in reproduction than in vegetative growth. by contrast, leaves from the north american populations were sampled during the wet part of the spring, to maximise chances of pathogen detection, and seeds were sampled during the dry part of the summer. nevertheless, we have observed albugo in the field in some of the european populations, whereas this has not been observed for the north american populations . moreover, high levels of resistance to different pathovars of a. candida has been observed in a. l. petraea relative to a.l. lyrata . the different conclusions based on sampling within north america and within europe emphasizes the importance of considering differences in local selection pressures when testing patterns of variation in r-genes.

at immune genes in animals, such as the mhc, signatures of diversifying  selection, such as high non-synonymous diversity, are often restricted to particular codons involved in antigen recognition, with high conservation of amino acids in the rest of the gene, resulting in the entire gene sequence showing no significant signatures of selection . this emphasises the importance of using site-specific tests to assess evidence for positive selection, as most genes will include a combination of selected and conserved sites. specific antigen binding sites at the mhc are conserved among vertebrates and can be used to test for selection specifically at these sites . however, there have been fewer comparative analyses of r-genes in plants to predict which sites will be involved in pathogen recognition across taxa. previous studies of r-gene evolution in a. thaliana have focused on lrr regions to identify signatures of selection  <cit> , as these regions are involved in the recognition of corresponding pathogen avirulence products. it is thus intriguing that we found evidence for positive selection at wrr <dig>  as well as rpm <dig>  since we only obtained reliable sequences from the lrr region for the latter. the exon  <dig> region should span the nb-arc domain of wrr <dig>  <cit> , part of whose function is in nucleotide binding  <cit> , but there have not been enough functional studies to determine whether there might be sites that bind to pathogen antigens in this region. strong balancing selection is predicted to result in signatures of selection in sites linked to the actual regions involved in recognition processes, but this would be expected to affect multiple sites . comparing variation between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  for a subset of individuals used for rad sequencing for european, north american outcrossing and north american selfing populations revealed quite similar patterns ; an overall excess of synonymous diversity  and no direct evidence of selection based on population-level tests. although there was slightly weaker population differentiation based on exon  <dig> than exon  <dig> , there was still substantial genetic structure among the three population sets and no allele sharing among european and north american samples. codon-based tests revealed no sites under positive selection for exon  <dig> but nine sites under negative selection. the reduced evidence for positive selection compared to the full dataset  could have been due to the absence of central european populations, which showed the highest divergence from the other populations. this was due to lack of amplification for exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> showed no evidence for positive selection but two codons showed episodic selection  and  <dig> sites showed negative selection. thus, while sequencing the lrr region would have been predicted to show stronger evidence of balancing selection, we did not find strong evidence for this based on these analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, using both fine- and broad geographic sampling in a. lyrata revealed evidence for the effects of selection, mating system and population genetic structure on patterns of polymorphism and divergence at r-genes. although we found little evidence for selection using fine-scale sampling within a. l. lyrata, this approach revealed low variation at r-genes in selfing relative to outcrossing populations and signatures of recent postglacial expansion into the great lakes region. by contrast, broad-scale comparisons between subspecies revealed some evidence for balancing selection in codon-based tests, haplotype sharing across widely divergent populations and subspecies, and patterns of r-gene variation distinct from neutral expectations. combining results from sampling at different spatial scales may therefore improve our understanding of the neutral and selective forces shaping polymorphism at genes associated with adaptation.
