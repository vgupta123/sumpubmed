BACKGROUND
non-heritable, sporadic ovarian cancer  continues to be the major cause of death by gynecological cancer in western countries  <cit> . early detection markers of oc are not yet available resulting in diagnosis at advanced stages with poor prognosis. nearly 90 % of oc tumors including carcinomas, cystadenomas, and borderline tumors are histologically related to the ovarian surface epithelium , a single layer of flat to cuboidal cells wrapping the ovary  <cit> . importantly, repeated wound damage-repair of the ose due to continuous, uninterrupted ovulatory cycles, remains as one of the current mainstream views proposed as oc initiating mechanism  <cit> . an alternative, recent notion, suggest that oc of the serous carcinoma type originates from the fallopian tube epithelium  <cit> .

the uninterrupted ovulation theory finds additional support in epidemiological data on reproductive history of women. conditions with reduced number of ovulation cycles such as pregnancies, anovulatory contraception and breastfeeding, confer a significantly reduced oc risk . conversely, continuous ovulation as in nulliparity, increases oc risk  <cit> . ovulation is essentially a pro-inflammatory process triggered by a luteinizing hormone  surge leading to increase of reactive oxygen species  levels in ovarian follicles  <cit> . indeed, ros scavengers placed in the ovarian bursa of mice can impair ovulation  <cit> . at the site of follicular rupture, ose cells undergo apoptosis and adjacent cells become exposed to oxidants and inflammatory signals  <cit> .

the ose is an extension of the peritoneal mesothelium. it is loosely attached to a basement membrane that separates it from the underlying stroma rich in dense collagenous fibers  <cit> . since the ose express epithelial, mesothelial and mesenchymal markers, it has been considered as an “uncommitted” or mixed epithelium. ose cells additionally express hormone receptors for gonadotropins , activin/inhibin , estrogen  and progesterone   <cit> . as the ovary reaches reproductive senescence, ose cells invaginate to form cortical epithelial crypts and inclusion cysts that have been proposed to be pre-neoplastic lesions  <cit> . in contrast to the mixed phenotype of the ose, inclusion cysts predominantly express epithelial markers, a phenotype consistent with an atypical reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition  observed in oc tumors  <cit> . while early ovarian carcinomas display increased expression of e-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker, advanced oc cells partially recover mesenchymal features, thus decreasing e-cadherin expression  <cit> .

due to its proposed relevance in oc initiation, ose cells from diverse sources have been characterized as experimental models of ovarian carcinogenesis. rodent ose cells detached from the ovaries undergo spontaneous transformation after repeated subcultivation  <cit> . furthermore, when injected in the peritoneal cavity of immunocompetent animals, such spontaneously transformed mouse ose  cells induce tumor implants and hemorrhagic ascites  <cit> , features typical of advanced human oc  <cit> . therefore, the proliferative pressure imposed on cultured mose cells seems to induce a transformation path resembling the naturally in vivo process of repetitive wound damage-repair.

importantly, the progression from a pre-malignant non-tumorigenic to an aggressive phenotype has been monitored in the mose culture model . altered actin cytoskeleton, reduced focal adhesion plaques, e-cadherin down-regulation and subcellular mislocalization of connexin- <dig>  among other parameters, have been used to define sequential stages of cell transformation  <cit> . massive cell cytoskeleton disorganization was found to be mediated by dysregulation of about  <dig> genes coding for components of actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments. in addition, altered global patterns of ser/tyr phosphorylation plus apc and pkcii mislocalization paralleled the remodeling of cellular architecture  <cit> .

cytogenetic changes have been also studied in the mose model  <cit> . by passage  <dig>  diploid and tetraploid cells coexisted. by passage  <dig>  mononucleated tetraploid cells - initially binucleated diploid due to citokinesis failure- become predominant over undetectable diploid cells. bipolar or multipolar mitosis occasionally occurs during proliferation of mononucleated tetraploid cells leading to chromosome mis-segregation and near-tetraploid aneuploidy  <cit> . in the present work we aimed to uncover gene networks underlying very early stages of mose transformation. at passage  <dig>  we detected dysregulation of three key protein complexes and numerous additional genes involved in chromosome dynamics during cell division. in addition, the first detectable aneuploidies were identified at passage  <dig>  we propose that these early transcriptional alterations would be both primarily implicated in cytokinesis failure of initial diploid cells, and also in anomalous mitosis leading to aneuploidy and tumorigenicity of late-passage, tetraploid mose cells.

RESULTS
strategy for genomic and transcriptional profiling of mose cells
we have previously used the nia-15 k microarray platform to study the transcriptomic and dna copy number  profiles of established, late passage malignant, clonal mose cell lines  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the experimental and analytical scheme followed in the present work. distinct, common reference samples for rna  and dna  microarray hybridizations were used. dye-swap was applied to counteract gene-specific labeling bias  <cit>  whereas print-tip loess normalization plus inter-slide scale percentile adjustment allowed us to minimize experimental variability of the microarray procedure arising from various sources  <cit> . the complete, normalized rna dataset for  <dig>  probes in  <dig> microarrays corresponding to  <dig> samples  is available as the additional file  <dig> . passage designation is hereafter referred as px, where x =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  rna data were deposited to geo  with the accession code gse <dig> fig.  <dig> microarray hybridization design and data analysis pipeline. genomic dna and total rna profiles of mose cells were obtained with cdna microarrays. double arrows in opposite directions indicate that a common reference design plus repeated dye-swap design was used for the two series. reference dna was genomic dna isolated from peripheral whole blood of adult c57bl <dig> male mice. reference rna was from a whole newborn male c57bl/ <dig> mouse  as in previous studies  <cit> . test rna and dna samples were co-purified from the same cultures samples, labeled and hybridized on nia-15 k cdna microarrays as described  <cit> . raw rna and dna datasets were separately normalized by print-tip loess with dnmad. limma  analysis was performed in pomelo <dig>  dna data was visualized in chromosomal format and smoothed with the webacgh tool  <cit> . differential expression and copy number were subjected to functional genomics analyses 




the in vitro transformation experiment of mose cells  <cit>  has been reproduced by several laboratories  <cit> . based on multiple growth parameters, roberts et al defined early, intermediate and late stages of mose transformation  <cit> . early  stage corresponded to p4- <dig> while early-intermediate  comprised cells at p20- <dig>  in the original work of roby et al  <cit> , p <dig> was the hallmark of pre-malignancy to malignancy. consistently, e-stage cells grew as single monolayers that did not form spheroids whereas e/i-stage cells were able to invade the collagen support and formed < <dig> μm spheroids  <cit> . therefore, as this evident phenotypic transition should rely on a gene-expression switch occurring before than p <dig>  we aimed to examine early, pre-malignant transcriptomic and genomic changes in a shorter time-course, i.e., every 3– <dig> passages. then, taking the transcriptomic profile of mose cells at p <dig> as “baseline”, paired limma tests with profiles of p <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were conducted to identify significant differentially expressed genes  during the course of the transformation process using an adjusted p-value <  <dig>  as cut-off. the p2-baseline transcriptome assumption implies that: i) p <dig> cells are the closest state to in vivo, “native” transcription; and ii) any extent of differential gene expression after p <dig>  reflects adaptation of mose cells to culture conditions in early passages and might reveal their intrinsic and spontaneous drift leading to aneuploidy-mediated transformation in later passages. the same rationale was applied to analyze genomic dna  data for which the baseline was a self-to-self experiment conducted with a reference, normal germline dna. in this case, we thought reasonable assuming that genomic dna of mose cells at p <dig> would be undistinguishable from germline dna, and that any dna copy number variation arising in later passages would be unequivocally detected with this approach. in addition to the limma analysis, the whole array-cgh dataset was put in chromosomal display by applying a smoothing algorithm and z-score filters .

figure 2a depicts the number of statistically significant probes  in the rna and the dna experiments for the mose cells culture passage series. earliest degs detected at p <dig> corresponded to  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes, the latter enriched in go: <dig> , go: <dig>  and go: <dig> . among genes classified under go: <dig>  cryab encodes for a hsp20-related, oxidative stress protein, able to suppress nasopharyngeal tumors by interfering β-catenin function  <cit>  while cyp1b <dig> decreases oxidative stress in endothelial cells  <cit> . therefore, downregulation of both cryab and cyp1b <dig> might be regarded as an oxidative stress initiator at p <dig>  regarding dna results, an array-cgh data subset of about  <dig> clones was significantly altered at p <dig>  but when placed in chromosomal context did not mark any loci. we cannot rule out if this dna data actually correspond to micro-deletions and/or micro-amplifications remaining cryptic due to the limited resolution of this array platform. however, as much less significant dna data was found in later p <dig> and p <dig>  such putative cryptic gains and losses at p <dig> might be regarded as transient, i.e., they do not persist across successive cell sub-cultivation.fig.  <dig> summary of differential transcription and dna aberrations during mose transformation. chart a shows the number of statistically significant probes  corresponding to non-redundant cdna clones of the nia-15 k collection for both the rna and the dna experiments across mose culture passages as indicated. the venn diagram in b depicts exclusive and common degs among sequential passages, each after individual comparison to passage 2




we found that transcriptional alterations were in part permanent or transitory along mose pre-malignant transformation. figure 2b attempts to clarify this result by using boolean comparisons for selected culture passages. only  <dig> out of the  <dig> deg at p <dig> were conserved by p <dig>  in turn, of  <dig> deg at p <dig>   <dig> were transient and  <dig> persisted until p <dig>  interestingly, dna copy number alterations dramatically emerged at p <dig>  which was the only stage that lacked “exclusive” differential expression. in addition to the  <dig> genes shared with precedent p <dig>   <dig> additional genes persisted to the subsequent p <dig>  in which cells express the tumorigenic phenotype. thus, p <dig> might be considered a transitional period in which copy-number alterations emerge in the presence of a more stable and discrete transcriptional repertoire respect to earlier and later passages.

further boolean comparisons were done between overlapping genes in p <dig> versus p <dig>  p <dig> versus p <dig> and p <dig> versus p <dig> comparisons shown in fig. 2b. seventeen genes were permanently down-regulated and  <dig> genes were permanently up-regulated from p <dig> through p <dig>  among the first group, arhgef <dig>  ctsb, ctsh, malat <dig> and sfpq were classified under the biological terms described in table  <dig>  notably, arhgef <dig> has been described as a tumor suppressor while malat <dig> and sfpq participate in biogenesis of paraspeckles . the  <dig> remaining down-regulated transcripts included 2010111i01rik, sorbs <dig>  phf <dig>  ubr <dig> and fth <dig>  catalogued under the term go: <dig> . on the other hand, the  <dig> up-regulated genes persisting until p <dig> were hs6st <dig>  a heparan-sulfate sulfotransferase linked to egf-like induced angiogenesis in oc cells  <cit> , hmga <dig>  coding for a non-histone chromosomal protein recently proposed as a diagnostic urine marker in serous epithelial oc  <cit>  and mmp <dig>  a matrix metallopeptidase implicated in oc metastasis  <cit> . interestingly, though high malat <dig> expression has been linked to cell proliferation and metastasis, a recent study suggest a tumor-suppressor role of malat <dig> in gliomas through inhibition of erk/mapk signaling and mmp2-mediated invasiveness  <cit> , findings consistent with its down-regulation in our model.table  <dig> ontology and pathway analysis of genes dysregulated at passage 14

dysregulated transcription prior to dna copy number alterations
given the particular transcriptomic and dna copy-number profile of p <dig>  it was reasonable to hypothesize that deg in previous p <dig> could lead mose cells towards a genomic instability process. table  <dig> shows a gene ontology  analysis of the  <dig> up-regulated plus the  <dig> down-regulated transcripts at p <dig> in the mose model. notably, among up-regulated genes, the top- <dig> enriched functions  comprised genes coding for centralspindlin, chromosome passenger and minichromosome maintenance  protein complexes, a set of structures essential for dynamics of mitosis. the centralspindlin complex is composed of the molecular motor kif <dig> and the gtpase activating protein racgap <dig>  the latter upregulated in gastric, colorectal and breast cancer . in addition, the go terms chromatin assembly, chromosome condensation, sister chromatid segregation, kinetochore, cytokinesis, histone binding, spindle, mitotic nuclear division, histone deacetylase binding and centrosome covered a total of  <dig> genes among which ccnb <dig> , birc <dig> , nusap <dig>  and kif <dig>  were the most recurrent. up-regulation of genes coding for centrosome components suggest centrosome amplification in a similar fashion as experimental plk <dig> overexpression it does  <cit> . a recurrent observation in many solid tumors is the presence of supernumerary centrosomes proposed to have a role in aneuploidy induction and subsequent tumorigenesis  <cit> .

moreover, the genes birc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdca <dig>  cenpa, itgb <dig>  mif, nusap <dig> and tacc <dig> have been classified under the mgi’s gene-phenotype term abnormal mitosis . birc <dig>  a well-known anti-apoptotic gene that constitutes the chromosomal passenger complex and also takes part of spindle and cytokinesis terms, is an oc growth promoting factor up-regulated by the luteinizing hormone   <cit> . among several hormone receptors, ose cells express lh and fsh receptors. gonadotropins lh and fsh increase at menopause and are considered oc predisposing factors  <cit> . on the other hand, the mcm complex consists of helicases needed for dna replication that normally are bound in excess to the chromatin to counteract replicative stress. as mcm genes over-expressed transiently in mose cells at p <dig>  we hypothesize that mcm depletion in later passages induce chromosomal aberrations upon overcoming a mitotic checkpoint as formerly described in hela cells  <cit> . additional go terms significantly enriched among up-regulated genes were steroid metabolic process, nucleotide metabolic process and extracellular matrix.

regarding down-regulated genes at p <dig>  the top enriched function was mrna processing covering  <dig> genes ,  <dig> of which were correlated to number of litters and to ovarian tumor frequency in a previous transcriptomic study of our laboratory aimed to associate reproductive parameters and spontaneous tumor rates across  <dig> mice strains  <cit> . rna processing has been increasingly connected to the dna damage response  <cit> , which in our results links to apoptosis through nupr <dig> and cdip <dig> , the latter a regulator of tnf-alpha-mediated, p53-dependent apoptosis  <cit> . furthermore, the splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich  has been involved in dna double-strands break repair  <cit>  and, together with neat <dig>  malat <dig>  atrx and crebbp, are catalogued under the cellular component nuclear body . interestingly, malat <dig> and neat <dig> are long non-coding transcripts that localize in a particular type of nuclear bodies termed paraspeckles, which consist of inter-chromatin ribonucleoprotein structures composed of neat <dig> as rna core plus a minimal set of rna-binding proteins including sfpq  <cit> . paraspeckles are emerging as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by its ability to sequestrate certain proteins  <cit>  and retain mature mrnas in the nucleus  <cit> . in addition, malat <dig> and neat <dig> were negatively correlated to ovarian tumor frequency, i.e., their levels were minimal in the ovaries of mouse strains displaying the highest spontaneous tumor rates  <cit> . downregulation of malat <dig> in this mose model along with its inverse correlation with spontaneous ovarian tumors in mice, is consistent with a recent report suggesting a tumor-suppressor role of malat <dig> in gliomas  <cit> . the above evidence combined suggests that mose cells at p <dig> tend to minimize the dna damage response by downregulating rna processing and export.

a second functional domain of downregulated genes at p <dig> was that comprised by unfolded & misfolded protein binding which overlapped with response to er stress. common to both terms were the two major er-stress chaperones hspa <dig> alias grp78/bip and hsp90b <dig> alias grp <dig>  which provide quality control in protein folding and overall cell homeostasis  <cit> . though in many cases established cancer cells display a constitutive er-stress response to cope with proliferative demand, resist chemotherapy and evade immunity , depression of er-stress response without evident apoptotic signaling in normal proliferating, non-malignant mose cells may simply indicate a decreased synthesis of secretory and membrane protein products. the third relevant down-regulated function was tumor suppression comprising  <dig> genes , of which the phosphatase and tensin homolog  is the best characterized in oc. pten has been implicated in papillary serous oc  <cit>  and endometroid oc  <cit>  whereas oc mouse models have been developed by deleting pten  <cit> .

protein networks of genes dysregulated by passage 14
under the assumption that transcript levels are directly proportional to protein levels, we used the string v <dig> database and tool  <cit>  to mine additional gene interrelationships derived from reported and predicted protein-protein interactions. further functional and physical associations among genes dysregulated by p <dig> are shown in the networks of fig.  <dig>  robust and highly interconnected networks were obtained by applying strict analysis settings that included only connected nodes ,  <dig> of  <dig> possible prediction methods and highest /high  levels of confidence scores for up-regulated/down regulated transcripts, respectively. the majority of connections were at least of  <dig> types, with a high frequency of experimental evidence  supporting the network.fig.  <dig> protein-protein interactions network among genes transiently expressed at passage  <dig>  the list of 101up-regulated  and  <dig> downregulated  unique gene identities were analysed with stringv <dig>  by limiting the prediction methods to co-expression, experiments, databases and textmining. the required confidence score was set to highest  in  and high  in  and the unconnected nodes  were hidden. in , enrichment was set to the term mitotic nuclear division  with proteins colored in red. asterisks and red ovals depict centralspindlin , chromosome passenger  and mcm  complexes. blue ovals enclose indicated additional go terms; ecm stands for extracellular matrix. in , enrichment was set to response to er stress  and asterisks indicate tumor suppressor genes. the type of interaction is defined by color lines at bottom right. detailed go terms are described in table  <dig>  in , the protein d2ertd750e corresponds to the updated knstrn gene




major hubs in the up-regulated network  comprised  <dig> genes covering most of the go terms mentioned above with mitotic nuclear division genes highlighted in red. among these, the  <dig> hubs composing the centralspindlin and chromosome passenger complexes plus ccnb <dig>  knstrn <dig>  nusap <dig>  dlgap <dig> and prc <dig>  were catalogued under the term spindle though the latter two are not classified as mitotic nuclear division genes. similarly, genes classified under centrosome including dlgap <dig>  ckap <dig>  mcm <dig>  tacc <dig> plus  <dig> of the mitotic nuclear division genes  were profusely interconnected. both the spindle and particularly the centrosome when amplified have been implicated in tumorigenesis with aneuploidy and malignant transformation  <cit> . centrosome amplification might impair chromosome segregation in a cell subjected to replicative stress  <cit> . consistently, as shown in table  <dig>  mose cells display upregulation of  <dig> genes involved in sister chromatid segregation including nusap <dig>  a protein that links microtubules to mitotic chromosomes and induces extensive bundling of spindle microtubules when is present in high levels  <cit> . similarly, based on multiple experimental evidences, the kinetochore-related gene cenpa was highly interconnected with several of the above mentioned genes. interestingly, despite not formally catalogued as nuclear division related,  <dig> genes of the mcm, an hexamer protein complex needed to initiate and regulate dna replication, showed multiple interactions with g1/s and g2/m transition-controlling cyclins ccnb <dig>  ccnb <dig> and ccna <dig>  as well as with cyclin inactivator cdc <dig> and the spindle assembler cdca <dig> 

another relevant hub in network of fig. 3a, was that of rrm <dig>  coding for the catalytic subunit of ribonucleotide reductase m <dig>  rrm <dig> converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides which are dna precursors required by a cell to proliferate continuously. coherently, rrm <dig> was in turn connected to thymidine kinase  <dig>  and dihydrofolate reductase . tk <dig> is a proliferation-dependent enzyme involved in pyrimidine salvage pathway while dhfr is essential for tetrahydrofolate recycling needed for dtmp synthesis from dump. tk <dig> has been considered an unspecific but useful serum cancer marker  <cit>  and dhfr was historically used as chemotherapeutic target  <cit> . finally, rrm <dig> was linked both to the  <dig> mcm complex genes and to the cell division genes cdca <dig>  birc <dig>  cdc <dig> and top2a.

on the other hand, the network formed among downregulated genes by p <dig> was much less interconnected . as expected, proteins of response to er stress were highly interconnected. of them, hspa <dig>  connected an additional protein trio comprising the amyloid beta precursor protein , cathepsin b  and chemokine receptor  <dig> . an additional hub was that of  <dig> ribosomal proteins plus  <dig> translational factors. of interest was the presence in this network of  <dig> from  <dig> putative tumor suppressor genes .

earliest dna copy number changes and its cognate gene expression profile
figure 4a shows the dna copy number profile of mose cells at p <dig> in an ideogram format illustrating physical chromosome positions. according to fig. 2a, p <dig> is the stage when the number of dna aberrations arises dramatically. by applying moving averages and z-score filters, discrete segmental gains were detected in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> while losses were found in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, in a previous genomic study we identified gains of important segments of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in established, late passage malignant, clonal mose cell lines  <cit> . since the microarray-cgh approach is unable to determine complete polyploidy, we suggest that such segmental chromosome dna aberrations detected at p <dig> might well correspond to the near-tetraploid genome observed by lv et al. in this mose model  <cit> . therefore, it is certainly possible that the apparent absence of dna copy changes in passages earlier than p <dig> could correspond to a complete tetraploid genome generated by cytokinesis failure as suggested by these authors  <cit> . note that  <dig> genes catalogued under cytokinesis and two of the  <dig> genes composing the chromosome passenger complex, a key structure engaged in the orderly exit from mitosis  <cit> , are overexpressed by passage  <dig> . as mentioned above, birc <dig>  expression promotes oc growth via lh stimulation  <cit>  and has been found overexpressed in many cancers  <cit> . besides its anti-apoptotic role, overexpression of survivin decreases nucleation of centrosomal microtubules affecting mitotic spindle dynamics and cytokinesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> segmental aneuploidies profile of mose cells prior to the malignant phenotype. microarray-cgh data  of culture passage  <dig> was analyzed and visualized with the web-acgh tool  <cit> . panel a shows the whole genome cgh profile. panel b shows overlapped dna copy number  and rna transcription  for the indicated chromosomes. smoothing window was set at  <dig> mbp and z-score at  <dig> 




as shown in fig. 4b, transcriptional data was superimposed over array-cgh data. a large  <dig> mbp segment of chromosome  <dig> was gained and, upon data smoothing, showed a concomitant trend of increased expression in two adjacent segments. this chromosomal segment contained nearly  <dig> genes for which proteolysis, cell-cycle, ribosome and rna processing were the predominant functional terms . in contrast, an  <dig>  mb segment of chromosome  <dig> showed no copy number alteration but apparent downregulation of  <dig> neighbor genes. later by passage  <dig>  dna copy number changes persisted with those of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> enlarged in size while transcriptional changes dramatically increased . over  <dig> genes were differentially expressed and enriched in focal adhesion , tnf-alpha nf-kb signaling pathway , tgf-beta receptor signaling pathway , ecm-receptor interaction , cell cycle  and ribosomal proteins . the oncogenes and oncogene-related transcripts myc, mycbp, ndrg <dig>  akt <dig>  fgfr1op <dig>  hras <dig>  rap1b, rhoa, rsu, lyn, rala and tet <dig> were also within this 500-subset. overall, the functional profile of cells at p <dig> is consistent with a malignant phenotype, in which a few gene expression modules were identifiable in the chromosomal context although not physically related to dna dosage variation in a large extent. these results suggest that aneuploidy in this mose model emerges with genomic aberrations at p <dig> in which chromosomal-driven transcription is not dominant but apparently follows a more complex pattern that drives to tumorigenesis.

mining passage- <dig> dysregulated genes in clinical phenotypes of human tumors
the cancer genome atlas  is an open repository of molecular and clinical information on various tumors including oc. the tcga ovarian expression dataset contains log <dig> data on  <dig>  coding genes for  <dig> cases of high-grade ovarian serous adenocarcinomas  <cit> . available clinical data includes tumor stage, grade and residual disease, primary therapy outcome, progression, and platinum response among others. to gain insight into the possible relevance of premalignant gene dysregulation in the mose model related to human ovarian tumors, the expression levels the  <dig> deg by p <dig> were mined in the ovarian tcga dataset. limma anova and t-tests were performed among ovarian tumor profiles according to platinum status  progression-free status  and tumor stage . for the last case, sub-stages a, b and c were collapsed into single ii, iii and iv stage categories. statistical results were ranked and genes with an adjusted p-value <  <dig>  and raw p-value < <dig>  were selected. on these lists, the  <dig> deg list in p <dig> mose cells was filtered out. ps resulted in  <dig> genes, pfs in  <dig> genes and ts in  <dig> genes present in the mouse  <dig> deg at p <dig>  shmt <dig> and arhgef <dig> were the top significant genes. all genes except shmt <dig> and etnk <dig>  corresponded to down-regulated genes in mose cells at p <dig>  figure  <dig> shows these two plus other  <dig> significant genes. despite hsp90b <dig>  expression has been linked to cancer growth and metastasis  <cit> , decreased hsp90b <dig> expression as tumor progresses is consistent with its proposed role as tumor suppressor in the tsgene database  <cit> . the arhgef <dig> pattern was paradoxically opposite in view of its proposed role as tumor suppressor in breast and colorectal cancer  <cit> . on the other hand, the platinum status pattern of all genes in fig. 5b, including hsp90b <dig>  suggest that their downregulation would indicate a poor chemotherapeutic response to cisplatin, the first line agent to treat oc.fig.  <dig> human ovarian tumor analysis of mose genes dysregulated at passage  <dig>  gene transcription data for human oc tumors as well clinical data was freely available from the tcga project website. mouse gene symbols were converted to their corresponding human orthologs. for the tumor stage data mining , data for  <dig> patients was used. for the platinum status , data for  <dig> patients was available. limma tests were applied as described in methods. selected genes shown were adj p <  <dig>  for tumor stage  and raw p <  <dig>  for platinum status 




CONCLUSIONS
the ose has been regarded as a possible origin of ovarian cancer caused by a chronic damage-repair cycling upon repetitive ovulatory events. such damage can be experimentally replicated in vitro leading to spontaneous cell transformation. the present study was an attempt to decode the early, pre-malignant genomic and transcriptomic changes occurring prior to the development of malignant capacity. initial segmental aneuploidies were detected at passage  <dig> in discrete segments of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these early dna aberrations were preceded by transient differential expression of  <dig> genes at p <dig>  based on previous cytogenetic analysis of this model by lv et al  <cit> , the functional profile of the  <dig> up-regulated genes at p <dig> enabled us to suggest that an abnormal mitotic process is taking place at p <dig> and might include centrosome amplification, cytokinesis failure and replicative stress. on the contrary, down-regulated genes indicate impaired rna processing, response to er stress and tumor suppression. the time course of transcriptional and genomic alterations of mose cells identified in the present study, particularly those between p <dig> and p <dig>  further agree with findings of lv et al  <cit> . specifically, we propose that profile of mose cells at p <dig> would correspond to tetraploid cells leading to a near-tetraploid stage at p <dig>  in which some of the segmental chromosome aberrations could initiate and perpetuate the tumorigenic drive. the gene expression profile of later passages indicates the rise of a frankly malignant phenotype. among the limitations of this study is the difficulty to extrapolate in vitro genomic and transcriptional changes to a pre-neoplasia arising in situ at the ose. it has been described that inclusion cysts present in aged ovaries may experience a particular epithelial-mesenchymal transition harboring pre-metaplasic characteristics. the interaction of ose with diverse cell types including interstitial and stromal ovarian cells as well as the immune cells infiltrating the senescent ovary, will certainly modulate the fate of a pre-neoplastic tetraploid cell formed as a consequence of repeated ovulation.
