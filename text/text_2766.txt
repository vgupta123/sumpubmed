BACKGROUND
phylogenetics is concerned with inferring the genealogical relationships between a group of organisms . these evolutionary relationships are typically depicted in a binary tree, where leaves represent the organisms of interest and edges represent the evolutionary relationships. phylogenetic trees have been used successfully in designing more effective drugs, tracing the transmission of deadly viruses, and guiding conservation and biodiversity efforts  <cit> . the grand challenge problem in phylogenetics is reconstructing the tree of life, the evolutionary history of the  <dig> to  <dig> million estimated organisms on earth. however, inferring evolutionary trees is not a trivial task. since the true evolutionary history for a set of organisms is unknown, the problem is often reformulated as an np-hard optimization problem. trees are given a score, where trees with better scores are believed to be better approximations of the true evolutionary history. for n taxa, there are an exponential number of evolutionary hypotheses: !! possible solutions to be exact. as a result, an exhaustive exploration of the space of possible solutions  is infeasible. thus, the most popular techniques in the field use heuristics to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.

in this paper, we develop new techniques to compare the performance of phylogenetic heuristics. while phylogenetic heuristics are used to search stochastically for the best trees in tree space, their results often vary across each run of the heuristic. as a result, it is difficult to compare performance among heuristics that produce different solutions. our work evaluates phylogenetic heuristics based on both the score and topology of the trees found. more specifically, our work centers around the following two questions.

 <dig>  what value  do slower heuristics provide?

 <dig>  how effective are parsimony scores in distinguishing between different tree topologies?

traditional techniques for comparing phylogenetic heuristics use convergence plots to show how the best score improves over time, as best scores are thought to symbolize more accurate trees. under this measure, the heuristic that obtains the best score in the fastest time is desired. given that different tree topologies may have identical tree scores, preference of good-scoring trees found by fast heuristics may result in overlooking potentially more accurate evolutionary histories that were found by slower approaches.

we consider the performance of two well-known maximum parsimony  search heuristics, parsimony ratchet  <cit>  and recursive-iterative dcm <dig>   <cit>  on four molecular datasets of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> taxa. the parsimony ratchet algorithm used in this paper is called pauprat since we used a perl script by bininda-emonds  <cit>  to generate a paup*  <cit>  batch file to run the parsimony ratchet heuristic. our first observation is that there are benefits to considering different speed heuristic implementations of a mp phylogenetic analysis. in general, pauprat is a slower heuristic than rec-i-dcm <dig>  since we were curious of the merits of a heuristic, time constraints were removed from consideration in this study. however, both pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> find different trees with the same best parsimony scores. these diverse best-scoring trees denote that the heuristics are visiting different areas of the exponentially-sized tree space. we note that although tnt  <cit>  has a faster implementation of parsimony ratchet than paup*, tnt does not have the capability to return to the user the set of trees found during each iterative step of the parsimony ratchet algorithm. the pauprat implementation of parsimony ratchet provides this capability. moreover, the rec-i-dcm <dig> implementation also provides users with the trees found during each step of the algorithm.

secondly, although different trees are found with the same parsimony score, it's interesting to consider whether maximum parsimony is effectively distinguishing between the trees, which has significant implications for understanding evolution. by using a measure called relative entropy, we show that for a given collection of trees, parsimony scores have less information content than topological distance measures such as robinson-foulds  distance  <cit> . in other words, for a collection of trees, parsimony scores identify fewer unique trees—which increases the potential of being stuck in a local optimum and producing less accurate phylogenies—than topological distance measures. thus, more powerful search strategies could be designed by using a combination of score and topological distance to guide the search into fruitful areas of the exponentially-sized tree space.

RESULTS
frequency of the top-scoring trees
the table shows the number of top-scoring trees found by each algorithm. stepi refers to trees that are i steps away from the best score. hence, step <dig> represents the number best-scoring trees, step <dig> are trees one step away from the best, and step <dig> are trees with parsimony scores two steps greater than the best score. each algorithm found  <dig>  total trees. for pauprat , the step <dig>  step <dig>  and step <dig> trees make up  <dig> %  of the  <dig>  total trees in the collection for the  <dig> taxa dataset. for the  <dig> taxa dataset, the top-scoring trees represent  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the  <dig>  trees found by pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig>  respectively.

topological comparisons of top-scoring trees
although the best trees are identical in the  <dig> taxa dataset, the heatmaps in figure  <dig> show that the pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> algorithms find topologically different trees that have the same parsimony score. furthermore, as the parsimony score increases, there is more variety in the topological structure of the step <dig> and step <dig> trees. the top-scoring trees found by rec-i-dcm <dig> algorithm are more similar to each other than their pauprat counterparts. finally, the heatmaps show that pauprat finds more topologically dissimilar trees than rec-i-dcm <dig>  thus, the rec-i-dcm <dig> stepi trees tend to form clusters that are distinct from the stepi pauprat trees.

next, consider the heatmaps in figure  <dig> which reflect strict consensus resolution rates for a collection of t trees. the heatmaps in this figure are read similarly to those in figure  <dig>  the difference is the interpretation of the cell . for example, on the  <dig> taxa dataset, cell  represents the strict consensus resolution of the  <dig>  step <dig> trees from pauprat. cell  is the strict resolution rate of the step <dig> rec-i-dcm <dig> trees with step <dig> pauprat trees. high resolution rates reflect high similarity among the trees of interest. overall, the consensus resolution rate is the highest for the step <dig> trees. this corroborates the results shown in figure  <dig> that step <dig> trees are more topologically similar to each other than higher scoring trees. furthermore, the strict resolution rate is greater among pauprat trees than its rec-i-dcm <dig> counterparts. for both pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig>  the majority resolution of comparing the top trees always resulted in a rate greater than 90% . there is little variation among the stepi trees when computing the majority tree. in fact, the results indicate that all of the top-scoring trees could be used to create the majority consensus tree with minimal impact on the consensus resolution rate. while it could be argued that the heatmaps in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> essentially agree, figure  <dig> gives greater insight into the differences found by individual trees. the consensus heatmaps, in contrast, summarize the information, and give a "bird's eye" view of bipartition sharing between trees found between the two approaches. by evaluating both types of heatmaps, the reader can fully appreciate the intricate similarities and differences of the two heuristics at hand, while still keeping sight of the overall picture.

comparisons over time
next, we focus on the performance of pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> in terms of time using all of the trees returned by each search heuristic. the purpose of this experiment is to determine the information content of parsimony scores and rf rates among the set of trees found by the heuristics. previous figures have shown that trees with the same parsimony score are distinct topologically. now, we broaden our analysis to incorporate all trees found by a heuristic over a defined time period. here, time is measured by the number of iterations  and not on wall-clock time . although number of iterations is an architecture-independent measure, it may not be completely adequate as each algorithm may do more work than the other per iteration. we are comparing heuristics based on their input/output behavior, which is the collection of trees returned after  <dig> runs of a heuristic, where each run consists of  <dig>  iterations. thus, we believe that using iterations as a basis of time is adequate for the purposes of this paper.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> use relative entropy as a measure for uniformly quantifying the information content of parsimony scores and rf rates. relative entropy is shown as a percentage of the maximum possible entropy. higher relative entropy means that there is more diversity  among the values of interest, and hence higher information content. lower relative entropy values denote homogeneous values and lower information content. one implication of low entropy values is that the search has reached a local optimum. higher entropy values signify that more diverse trees are found by a phylogenetic heuristic, which lessen its probability of being trapped in local optima.

in figure  <dig>  pauprat has a higher relative entropy than rec-i-dcm <dig> when comparing parsimony scores and rf distances for the  <dig> and  <dig> taxa datasets. that is, pauprat trees have a more diverse range of parsimony scores and rf values than rec-i-dcm <dig> trees. for the  <dig> taxa curves, rec-i-dcm <dig> has a much higher relative entropy than pauprat. moreover, for rec-i-dcm <dig>  parsimony score entropy values are much higher than rf rate values for  <dig> taxa. such a result implies that the parsimony scores of trees are more diverse than their topologies. in other words, trees with different scores when compared topologically are similar. for pauprat, the relative entropy values vary more than for rec-i-dcm <dig>  which has relative entropy values that are fairly constant across iterations. essentially, such behavior denotes that the rec-i-dcm <dig> search has converged as there is not much change in the parsimony or rf rates among the trees found.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we used novel methods to assess the quality of two maximum parsimony heuristics, pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig>  the goal of this work was to both ascertain the value of slower heuristics and determine if parsimony score is effective in distinguishing between different tree topologies. we designed a new entropy-based measure, which we used in tandem with parsimony scores and robinson-foulds  distance, to quantify levels of tree heterogeneity across the pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> heuristics over several datasets. in addition, we used heatmaps to visualize levels of tree diversity found by the heuristics.

our results show that parsimony score masks tree diversity in large populations of equally parsimonious trees. by using relative entropy, there is more information content in topological distance measures  than in parsimony scores. furthermore, when considering three groups of top-scoring  trees, there is a wide-range of topological differences among these trees. in some cases, by using our relative entropy measure, parsimony scores are more diverse than the tree topologies found. this suggests that our topology-based methods may be more reliable in quantifying fine-grain differences between different heuristics, especially in larger datasets.

our experiments with the two heuristics, show that pauprat searches through tree space more slowly than rec-i-dcm <dig>  however, both pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> find trees with the best score. pauprat's trees tended to be more diverse, especially on larger datasets. pauprat's diverse collection of trees suggests its ability to escape local optima. given that both heuristics find different classes of equally parsimonious trees, they are both useful in reconstructing phylogenies. typical performance studies based on convergence speed of phylogenetic heuristics to the best score would discount heuristics that had a slower convergence rate. while speed is certainly important, ultimately the goal of phylogenetics is to obtain an accurate evolutionary tree for a group of taxa. given that accuracy is typically based on a score given to a tree, we would like to be able to obtain all best-scoring trees. for the datasets studied here, our results show that both pauprat and rec-i-dcm <dig> are necessary to obtain a diverse collection of best-scoring trees. depending on the value of these different hypotheses, our study shows that it may be worthy to improve an implementation of slower algorithms if they search a different aspect of tree space than their counterparts. in the future, we plan to create additional metrics for ascertaining levels of diversity in populations of trees. this work will also be extended to include maximum likelihood heuristics. finally, we plan to use our results to develop new heuristics that improve the accuracy of reconstructing evolutionary trees.
