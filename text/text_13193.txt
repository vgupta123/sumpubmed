BACKGROUND
dna methylation is one of the most commonly occurring epigenetic phenomena in the human genome. it is one of the major regulators of gene transcription and plays a vital role in many cellular processes. in the last decade, numerous studies have shown that abnormal methylation patterns are linked to phenotypic differences and development of disease .

recent technological advances have provided multiple platforms for systematically interrogating dna methylation variation across the genome  <cit> . among them, the illumina humanmethylation <dig> beadchip   is a new-generation array constituting a major extension of the previous infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip   and can be used to assess the methylation condition of more than  <dig>  cytosines distributed over the entire genome. sandoval et al.  <cit>  validated the hm <dig> chip by showing that methylation patterns measured in colorectal cancer cell lines and normal mucosa were consistent with those found in bisulfite genomic sequencing. other recent studies have extensively evaluated data generated from this chip and developed data processing and analysis pipelines .

similar to other microarray experiments , it is important to evaluate the impact of technical variation in the measurement. a well-known source of bias for epigenome-wide association studies  of dna methylation is the so-called “batch effect”, which is largely caused by technical differences from one chip to the next. although many statistical methods have been proposed to correct for batch effects , no approach has been generally accepted. alternatively, it will be useful to consider statistical measures that can quantify the extent to which the measured methylation level at a specific cpg site is affected by technical errors. for cpg sites with large inter-individual variation, it may be reasonable to assume that technical differences will have relatively low impact at these sites. however, the hm <dig> chip contains a large number of cpg sites with little inter-individual variation in methylation levels, for which it is critical to consider additional statistics to evaluate the impact of technical errors.

in experiments, technical replicates are often included which can be used to evaluate the consistency of measurement. meng et al.  <cit>  suggested using technical replicates to identify and exclude “non-variable” cpg sites, at which the technical “noise” outperforms true biological variation. their data came from the illumina goldengate methylation array and consisted of  <dig> samples assayed at  <dig>  sites. however, no comprehensive work has been done for the hm <dig> chip.

in the atherosclerosis risk in communities  study, the hm <dig> chip was used for genome wide profiling of dna methylation in  <dig>  african-american individuals assayed at  <dig>  cpg sites, with  <dig> replicate pairs or triplets included. we evaluated the consistency of methylation measurement at each cpg site based on the intraclass correlation coefficient , which compares the within- and between-replicate variations. we next modeled the icc values using a mixture model approach to classify cpg sites on the hm <dig> chip into high and low reliability clusters. we demonstrated the relationship of this classification to the results of an association study between methylation level and smoking status of aric study participants.

the aim of this work was to apply a statistical procedure to identify cpg sites which give consistent values for methylation levels in dna extracted from peripheral blood using the hm <dig> chip , thereby providing insight into the performance of this chip across cpg sites. we hope that our results will facilitate subsequent ewas analyses.

RESULTS
based on the icc, we quantified the reliability of methylation measurements on the hm <dig> chip using technical replicates included in the analysis of dna methylation in aric study participants. the cpg sites were then classified into low and high reliability groups by modeling the distribution of the icc. we further demonstrated the relationship of measurement reliability to the associations between methylation and smoking status in the aric study.

distribution of icc
using the  <dig> technical replicates available in the aric methylation data, we calculated the icc value for each cpg site assayed on the hm <dig> chip. after excluding sites with low pass rate,  <dig>  cpg sites were analyzed. the distribution of icc is shown in figure  <dig>  the median icc value was  <dig> . we observed one cluster of sites with relatively high icc values , one cluster with relatively low icc values , and an additional cluster of sites with icc of  <dig> . this empirical distribution supported the truncated/censored normal mixture model we assumed.figure  <dig>

we further investigated how the icc values change with the variation  of methylation levels. it is reasonable to assume that when the sd is large, the relative impact of technical error becomes small and methylation measures for technical replicates will in general be consistent. using a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing  approach, we observed a positive correlation between icc and variation of methylation . in practice, an ewas can apply a filter based on methylation variation to focus on cpg sites with large variation, e.g., sd >  <dig>   <cit> . in our results, among cpg sites with sd of  <dig>  or above , 78% had icc >  <dig> , and 95% had icc >  <dig>  . however, these sites accounted for only 4% of the cpg sites surveyed by the hm <dig> chip. it is therefore important to assess measurement reliability on the cpg sites with low or moderate variation in methylation levels.figure  <dig>

we examined the distribution of icc values by the two types of infinium probes . compared to the infinium ii probes, a larger proportion of infinium i probes showed smaller icc values and less consistency between technical replicates. specifically, there are  <dig> % infinium i probes with icc >  <dig> , while  <dig> % of infinium ii probes have icc >  <dig> . similar comparison was done for cpg sites’ relation to cpg islands . the infinium i probes have higher proportions in cpg islands than the infinium ii probes  <cit> , and we observed less sites in cpg islands with high icc compared to those not in cpg islands.figure  <dig>

chen et al.  <cit>  reported a list of cross-reactive probes  on the hm <dig> chip that can co-hybridize to alternate sequences on the genome. we observed enrichment for these probes with low icc values , suggesting that cross-reactivity may explain the low reliability at some cpg sites. in addition, we examined the distribution of icc for cpg sites within 50 bp of snps  <cit> , but found no significant difference from rest of the cpg sites .figure  <dig>

classification of cpg sites using mixture models
to classify the cpg sites based on the consistency of methylation measures between technical replicates, we used a mixture model approach to the observed icc values. we first fit a censored normal mixture model, which assumes a high reliability cluster of cpg sites  and a low reliability cluster . in addition, we fit a truncated normal mixture model to the non-zero icc values, to allow flexibility in modeling the cluster of icc equal to  <dig>  estimates of the mixing proportion of the high reliability component, means and standard deviations of the two normal distributions are given in table  <dig> table  <dig>

the observed and fitted distributions of icc values for the two models are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the maximized log likelihood value was compared for the two mixture models . the truncated normal mixture model using sample proportions to estimate the relative size of the cluster for icc =  <dig> had a higher maximized log likelihood than that of the censored normal mixture model. in the following discussion, we grouped the cpg sites with icc =  <dig> as a separate cluster , and classified the sites with non-zero icc values into low reliability and high reliability clusters based on the posterior probability π from the fitted truncated normal mixture model. to maximize the size of the high reliability cluster, we chose a rather low cutoff value of  <dig>  for π , which corresponds to an icc value of  <dig> . the numbers of cpg sites classified into each of the three clusters were:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  .figure  <dig>

data application: association with smoking status
next, we investigated how association patterns between phenotypes and methylation levels vary across different reliability clusters using smoking status from the aric study as an illustrative example. complete information on methylation levels, smoking status, and covariates was available for  <dig>  african american participants. the average age was  <dig>  years ,  <dig> % were female, and  <dig> % were current smokers.  <dig> cpg methylation sites displayed genome wide significant association , with current smoking status, or  <dig> cpg sites after excluding those with at least one common snp within  <dig> base pairs. among the  <dig> associated sites, only  <dig> were from the low reliability cluster, and none from the zero-icc cluster.

we further investigated distributions of the smoking-associated cpg sites in the low and high reliability clusters, and compared to the distribution of icc values in each cluster . in both clusters the number of associated sites increases with increase in icc values. in the low reliability cluster, most of the associated cpg sites had icc >  <dig> , while a high density of low icc  values was observed in this cluster. in the high reliability cluster, the distribution of associated sites was more proportional to the distribution of icc. the relationship between association p-values and icc at all cpg sites is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
recent technological advances have provided high-throughput array for systematically interrogating dna methylation across the genome. this allows investigators to evaluate regions of the genome in which variation in dna methylation may influence gene expression and ultimately disease risk. one of the potential problems that could threaten the validity of methylation-phenotype association results is the variability of technical measurements . here we used technical replicates to assess reliability of methylation measurement on cpg sites interrogated by the hm <dig> chip. using a mixture model approach, we classified cpg sites into low and high reliability groups. the icc value can serve as a measure to quantify the impact of technical errors, especially batch effects. in addition, cpg sites with low reliability could be excluded in subsequent analyses to improve the power of ewass by reducing the burden of multiple hypothesis tests.

in our analysis of  <dig> technical replicates available as part of the aric methylation data, we classified cpg sites on the hm <dig> chip by a mixture of truncated normal and normal distributions, with ~44% sites in the cluster of high reliability. for cpg sites with high icc values, the variation between independent biological samples is relatively large compared to the variation due to technical error. we expect statistical tests performed for the sites with high icc will have more power to detect association between methylation level and phenotype of interest than for the sites with low icc. in the follow-up ewas of smoking status, we showed that a majority  of genome-wide significant associations are from the high reliability cluster, even though only 44% of all sites were in this cluster.

the icc provides a measure of reliability for the methylation measurement. in ewass, it is well known that batch effects can threaten the validity of association results  <cit> . commonly used methods for batch effects correction include empirical bayes methods  <cit> , surrogate variables  <cit> , and linear mixed-effects  models. however, it is difficult to completely control or remove batch effects in association tests. alternatively, we can use icc to quantify to what extent the batch effects can affect the methylation measures. the probes for cpg sites with low icc are expected to be more vulnerable to technical variability including batch effects. similar to the icc for replicates, we calculated icc for chip effects , which is the proportion of variation in measured methylation levels due to chip difference in the experiment. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows that when iccchip is close to  <dig>  most of the variation in methylation measures is due to technical “errors”. reliability of methylation measures is therefore low at these cpg sites, with icc for replicates close to  <dig>  on the other hand, when icc for replicates is close to  <dig>  technical variability has minimal contribution to the methylation measures, and little batch effects are observed .

in addition to the ewas of smoking status using lmm, we performed the ewas using a linear regression model without adjusting for chip and chip position . there were  <dig>  cpg sites significantly associated with smoking status, after excluding sites with low pass rate or with at least one common snp within  <dig> base pairs. among these sites, there was no site in the zero-icc cluster,  <dig> sites from the low reliability cluster, and  <dig>  sites from the high reliability cluster. all except  <dig> sites identified by the lmm were also genome-wide significant in this model. the number of significant sites without adjustment for chip and chip position was approximately  <dig> -fold higher than we observed in the ewas with those adjustments. we hypothesize that some of the additional associations are false positives due to technical errors. we also compared our results to published ewass of smoking studies , which were carried out in individuals of european and african ancestry. we were able to validate ~80% of the reported signals with genome-wide significance. of these,  <dig> sites were found within the body of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor  gene, with a 15% decrease in the mean methylation level of cp <dig> in current smokers compared to non-smokers  as previously shown in the other studies.

the icc value is determined by two variance components,  for variance between independent samples and  for variance within replicates of the same sample. when sample characteristics  are controlled for,  becomes smaller which leads to smaller icc than the current estimates . when batch effects are controlled for, both  and  can be reduced and the icc can increase or decrease at different cpg sites .

the empirical distribution of c we observed is similar to that of meng et al.  <cit> , in which an earlier version of the illumina goldengate array having  <dig>  cpg sites was used. in their analysis, pearson product–moment correlation was primarily used between replicate pairs, although icc was also introduced. our analysis updates the information for the hm <dig> chip, and focuses on icc which allows more than two replicates per biological sample.

meng et al. observed that, compared to cpg sites not in cpg islands, a higher proportion of sites in cpg islands showed low inter-individual variation in methylation levels relative to within-individual variation , consistent with a previous finding by bock et al.  <cit> . our results further confirmed this observation. in contrast, dedeurwaerder et al.  <cit>  studied technical replicates of a human colon cancer cell line and showed that the probe-wise variation of methylation levels were greater for infinium ii probes than those for infinium i probes. however, their findings were limited to within-individual variation, with no comparison to inter-individual variation. in addition, given the small number of replicates, the impact of batch effects was minimal in their study. therefore the results were not directly comparable.

from the distribution of icc values we noted that the distribution of high icc component is slightly left skewed, with few cpg sites having icc close to  <dig>  because of the normal distribution assumption for this component in the mixture model, this skewness may lead to an underestimate for the corresponding variance parameter  and under-fit the distribution of icc in the middle , in both of the truncated and censored normal mixture models. the direct consequence is that cpg sites with moderate icc values will have a small posterior probability of being in the high reliability cluster. as a possible remedy, we considered three-component mixture models, with an additional normal distribution component to model the moderate icc values. however, the model fit was poorer than the 2-component models .

to classify the cpg sites into different reliability groups, meng et al.  <cit>  chose a cutoff of  <dig>  for the posterior probability and suggested to exclude the “non-variable” sites in the low reliability group. in contrast, we set a rather small cutoff of  <dig>  to include more sites with moderate icc into the high reliability cluster, given the discussion above. in the aric study, the low reliability cluster contributes only ~4% of significant associations in the ewas of smoking status, with only two associated sites having icc <  <dig> . we believe that validation using other approaches is especially important for sites with low icc, for example, bisulphite pyrosequencing and replication in an external validation cohort. in this specific example, restricting analysis to cpg sites in the high reliability cluster would result in the loss of only a few significant association signals and could improve the power of ewas by reducing the number of hypothesis tests by more than a half. to demonstrate, we calculated the statistical power at different effect sizes , based on a sample size of  <dig>  and genome-wide significance level determined using bonferroni correction. we assume 50% cpg sites will be excluded due to low icc. we observe power increase of ~5% under this setting . for other studies, investigators may decide their own cutoff for the icc. even if all cpg sites on the chip are to be included in the association analysis, the icc can still serve as a measure of how likely the association results are to be affected by technical errors.

here, we aimed to describe the distribution of icc using a statistical approach. our results clearly approximate the observed distribution. however, it is unknown what biological or chemical factors explain the difference in performance of the corresponding probes on the chip between the low  and high reliability clusters. it is also unknown whether our results can be generalized to other populations or other types of tissues. the methylation profiling in aric samples are from white blood cells, which is a mixture of multiple cell types, and the participants are african americans. it has been shown that both cell type composition  <cit>  and sample ethnicity  <cit>  can heavily influence dna methylation pattern. it is unknown whether our results will still hold when a purified cell type, e.g., monocytes or neutrophils, or different tissue is used, or when samples from different ethnic groups are included. as an example, etcheverry et al.  <cit>  carried out an ewas to identify cpg sites differentially methylated between glioblastoma and control samples using brain tissues. among the  <dig> cpg sites identified,  <dig> are interrogated on the hm <dig> beadchip. we examined the icc values for these  <dig> sites in our data, and found  <dig> sites to belong to the high reliability group ,  <dig> to belong to the low reliability group, and  <dig> to belong to the zero-icc group. enrichment of significant associations in the high-icc group in that study suggests that our results may have reasonable generality.

in addition, we used the “raw” methylation measures produced by the genomestudio software with minimal normalization. other normalization procedures or use of m-values  <cit>  instead of β-values may result in different icc values. however, the same analytical approach used here can be applied in other studies, if technical replicates are included.

another limitation of the study is that we did not take into account the estimation uncertainty when estimating the icc, which can lead to different confidence intervals for this reliability measure. we will consider a weighted estimation approach in future studies, and re-classify the cpg sites on the hm <dig> chip.

CONCLUSIONS
we examined the reliability of methylation measurements using the latest hm <dig> chip, and demonstrated that the cpg sites assayed on this array can be potentially classified according to different levels of reliability. we also evaluated the impact of measurement reliability on results of ewas. the biological differences between the clusters of cpg sites need to be further investigated. the estimated icc values for all cpg sites on the hm <dig> chip are available in additional file  <dig>  we hope that our results can provide additional guidance on inclusion/exclusion of cpg sites for future ewass using the hm <dig> chip, and our analysis approach can be generalized to other types of methylation arrays.
