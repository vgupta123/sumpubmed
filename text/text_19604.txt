BACKGROUND
recent studies into resident heritable symbiotic microorganisms have highlighted the central role they play in their insect host’s ecology and evolution  <cit> . these symbionts can be classified as either obligate or facultative for host survival. facultative symbionts are not essential for host development or reproduction, but their presence can impact upon host dynamics by manipulating host reproduction  <cit> , as well as increasing host survival or fecundity  <cit> , whereas removal of obligate symbionts results in the death of its host  <cit> . one successful group of such symbiotic microorganisms belongs to the genus wolbachia. these are intracellular, maternally-inherited bacteria belonging to the alpha-proteobacteria group rickettsia. they are among the most successful genus of bacteria, found in filarial nematodes, crustaceans, arachnids, and are estimated to occur in  <dig> - 70% of all insect species  <cit> .

wolbachia have the ability to induce a number of reproductive manipulations of their hosts, such as feminisation of genetic males, induction of sperm-egg incompatibilities, thelytokous parthenogenesis, and male-killing  <cit> . through these processes, wolbachia provides infected host-females with a relative reproductive advantage over uninfected females  <cit> . each of these mechanisms increases the symbiont-infection frequency by ensuring that the number of infected daughters produced by an infected female is greater than the average production of daughters per female. a single insect or population may be infected with more than one symbiotic microorganism and different populations may have different infection statuses  <cit> .

both wolbachia and host mitochondria are maternally transmitted and subsequently can be co-inherited by the offspring. the high mutation rate of mitochondrial dna makes it a valuable evolutionary marker when compared to corresponding nuclear dna  <cit> . with this in mind, it also has the advantage of very low recombination, resulting in the whole mtdna genome having the same genealogical history  <cit> . it is well documented that symbionts such as wolbachia can impact upon mtdna diversity within host populations  <cit> . indeed, the strong linkage between the two co-inherited markers makes them ideal candidates for the investigation of symbiont invasion-history and symbiont impact upon host genetics  <cit> . previous studies have documented the role of wolbachia in driving dramatic changes within host populations, due to the phenotypes induced by the symbionts  <cit> . it is now widely accepted that endosymbiont screening and analysis should take place before any attempt to explain mtdna patterns in terms of host ecology and evolution  <cit> .

the larval stage of the african armyworm, spodoptera exempta , is one of the most devastating crop pests in africa, feeding upon many of the staple food crops such as maize, wheat, sorghum, millet, rice and pasture grasses. most outbreaks occur on the eastern half of sub-saharan africa, as far north as sudan and as far south as south africa  <cit> . the adult moths are highly migratory, often flying hundreds of kilometres over consecutive nights  <cit> , with moth movements largely determined by the seasonal progression of the inter-tropical convergence zone . therefore, it is believed that early-season armyworm outbreaks in central tanzania essentially act as “source” populations for moths that will subsequently migrate to northern tanzania and further northwards towards the horn of africa  <cit> .

a baculovirus, spexnpv, is known to be present in field populations of armyworms causing larval mortality, which can have significant impact upon host population dynamics during sporadic natural epizootics. in a recent study, we found that armyworm harboured three strains of wolbachia, designated wexe <dig>  wexe <dig> and wexe <dig> <cit> . based on mlst classification, one of the strains, wexe <dig>  was 100% identical to st- <dig>  which is a male-killing phenotype found in the nymphalid butterfly, hypolimnas bolina <cit> . the other two strains of wolbachia are new sequence-types, assigned st- <dig>  and st- <dig> . interestingly, both laboratory and field data showed that infection with wexe <dig> strain increased host susceptibility to a baculovirus, which could have clear implications for the evolutionary history of the host and pathogen  <cit> .

in the current study, our aim was to address the following questions:  how robust is the male-killing phenotype and efficiency of wexe <dig> vertical transmission?  in the field, is global wolbachia infection associated with particular host mitochondrial genotypes?  is there evidence of a selective sweep within the host population? to answer these questions, we established laboratory cultures of wexe1-infected armyworm to assess the infection phenotype. we obtained partial sequences of wolbachia genes and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i  gene from field-collected s. exempta larvae and adults collected from pheromone traps. we examined the diversity of mitochondrial haplotypes, and analysed mtdna variation to explore the potential association with different wolbachia infection statuses.

RESULTS
phenotypic effects of wolbachia infection
two wexe1-infected and several uninfected isofemale lines were established from field-collected pupae, and maintained under laboratory conditions for > <dig> generations. the two wexe1-infected lines had female-biased mean sex ratios of 1: <dig>  for the first  <dig> generations, suggesting an efficient transmission of the infection. on average, only  <dig> %  of the eggs hatched in the infected lines, compared to  <dig> %  in uninfected lines, indicating that wolbachia caused the male-killing phenotype at the embryonic life-stage. in generation  <dig>  a single wexe1-infected breeding pair produced a sex ratio of 10: <dig> , suggesting that inefficient transmission can occur within this host-endosymbiont complex. pcr analysis of the offspring from this pair indicated a wolbachia infection rate of  <dig> %  in the females, and 0%  in the males. tetracycline treatment cured the insects of wolbachia infection, and produced sex ratios and egg hatch rates comparable to naturally uninfected isofemale lines , demonstrating that wolbachia was the cause of the observed distortions.

wolbachia and host mtdna coi gene diversity
larvae  were screened for the presence of wolbachia from  <dig> outbreaks distributed across tanzania over a 4-year period . wolbachia infections were not detected in any of the male moths  collected in the  <dig> pheromone traps . three strains of wolbachia were isolated, with mlst analysis indicating two new strains, and one strain identical to st- <dig> . strains wexe <dig>  wexe <dig> and wexe <dig> were observed in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> outbreaks  <cit> , respectively, with  <dig> outbreaks containing all three strains,  <dig> with two,  <dig> with just one, and  <dig> with no wolbachia present . overall wolbachia prevalence was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in sampled larvae over the three outbreak seasons. mitochondrial coi sequences were obtained from a subsample of larval and adult-males collected from populations throughout tanzania over two seasons . a total of  <dig> different haplotypes were found in the armyworm samples  . the host coi haplotype diversity estimate was found to be low . 

according to neutral evolutionary theory, estimates of tajima’s d and fu & li’s d* and f* statistics are expected to equal zero. positive values are consistent with an excess of intermediate-frequency variants, whereas negative values indicate an excess of rare variants, as can result from a recent population bottleneck or a selective sweep. in the present study, estimates of d, d* and f* statistics were all negative for the coi gene . of the  <dig> sequences obtained,  <dig>  belonged to the same haplotype, assigned haplo <dig> . significantly, all the wolbachia infections detected in s. exempta were found associated with mtdna haplo <dig>  suggesting that recent selective sweeps associated with the invasion of wolbachia have affected mtdna diversity in the armyworm population, with a skewed prevalence of haplo <dig>  six of the haplotypes did differ by up to 11% in their nucleotide sequence to the other eleven . eight of the seventeen haplotypes displayed only a single nucleotide difference from haplo <dig>  suggesting possible nucleotide substitution events occurring from haplo <dig>  apart from haplo <dig>  all of the other haplotypes were very rare, each only detected in a single individual, making any inference on distribution-structuring or migratory behaviour difficult . this is most probably as a result of the highly migratory nature of this host species.

host nuclear gene diversity
a skew of mtdna can also result from demographic processes, such as an evolutionary bottleneck, although crucially the latter affects nuclear as well as mitochondrial loci. to investigate this further, we analysed approximately  <dig> bp of the 28s nuclear ribosomal protein gene from a geographically diverse sub-sample of the insects used to test the haplotypes . there was high gene diversity with the vast majority of individuals differing by  <dig> –  <dig> nucleotide substitutions . estimates of tajima’s d and fu & li’s d* and f* statistics were non-significant, suggesting no selection for any particular nuclear genotype . this suggests that a bottleneck has not occurred, and that the coi skew is a result of a selective sweep, mostly likely driven by the invasion of wolbachia infections.

discussion
we explored the evolutionary history of wolbachia pipientis infections in tanzanian populations of the african armyworm, s. exempta. three strains of wolbachia have recently been detected at an infection prevalence of approximately 12%  <cit> . based on previous mlst analysis   <cit> , one of these strains, wexe <dig>  is 100% identical to st- <dig>  which is a male-killing phenotype found in the blue moon butterfly, hypolimnas bolina <cit>  and, based on nucleotide identity for wsp and ftsz genes, 100% identical to the wolbachia isolate found in tanzanian populations of the common acraea, acraea encedon <cit> . this indicates that an infection-transmission event may have occurred between host species at some point in evolutionary history, possibly via a shared generalist parasitoid  <cit> . indeed, a recent study has shown that plant-mediated horizontal transmission may also be possible in some insect-endosymbiont systems  <cit> . the phenotypes of strains wexe <dig> and wexe <dig> are as yet undetermined. however, due to the absence of wolbachia in male adult moths, it is possible that all three strains of wolbachia display the male-killing phenotype. male-killing wolbachia have been previously identified in both wolbachia clade a  <cit>  and clade b e.g.  <cit> .

male-killing is a widespread phenotype in lepidopteran-infecting wolbachia and does appear to explain the sex ratio bias and egg-hatch rate in our infected lab lines. however, we cannot exclude the possibility of a more complicated scenario in the field, as wolbachia is not the only cause of sex ratio distortion to be discovered in insects  <cit> . studies on a range of species have revealed a number of insect endosymbionts that can cause similar phenotypic effects to wolbachia <cit> , including the generation of complex fitness interactions between infection-agent and host sex chromosomes, leading to sex-biased mortality  <cit> ; dgge analysis suggests that no secondary endosymbionts occur in the armyworm  <cit> , but this remains an interesting avenue for more detailed future study.

the lack of geographical structuring  throughout tanzania is most likely due to the highly migratory nature of the armyworm, thereby preventing genetic differentiations from establishing. this failure to detect any spatial structuring in the armyworm population is consistent with early genetic analyses using iso-enzymes over a much wider east african geographical range  <cit> . the very large effective population size of this outbreaking species is also likely to be factor. the use of microsatellite markers is currently being examined as a technique allowing more sensitive exploration of the armyworm population structure  <cit> .

of particular interest was that all three strains of wolbachia were found to be associated with the same host haplotype, haplo <dig>  this haplotype was found in  <dig> % of samples tested, suggestive of a selective sweep of this haplotype. no other host haplotype was observed to harbour wolbachia, indicative of very low levels of horizontal symbiont transmission between individuals within a population. the high 28s nuclear gene variability, but selection for a single mtdna haplotype, provides evidence that coi selection is being driven, and that this pattern is not due to demographic processes alone, such as a genetic bottleneck. we propose that this is due to the presence of multiple strains of wolbachia . two hypotheses have been previously proposed for why male-killers reduce mtdna diversity, causing a sweep  <cit> . firstly, the initial invasion of wolbachia, and the subsequent selection for the beneficial parasite genes will result in selective sweeps of the co-inherited mtdna molecules. secondly, once the wolbachia invasion has reached equilibrium within the host population, the effective population size of mtdna will be reduced because mtdna mutations in uninfected females will tend to be lost  <cit> . we propose that such a marked haplo <dig> sweep has occurred due to three separate wolbachia-strain invasion events associated with mtdna haplo <dig>  each one enhancing the haplo <dig> sweep further. it is known that invasion events can cause selection for a particular haplotype, and therefore if three such events occurred in the same haplotype, a haplotype-skew towards 90% prevalence may not be unexpected. however, it must be stated that at this stage of our research, we can only speculate on this possibility.

so why is there such a large haplotype skew  but only a moderate prevalence  of wolbachia? several hypotheses have been proposed for maintaining wolbachia prevalence equilibrium within host populations, including meta-population structure, mating preference, and environmentally-occurring antibiotics  <cit> . all such spontaneous “cure” events would increase the ratio of uninfected individuals with the same haplotype to infected individuals. we propose two main hypotheses that may explain wolbachia stability in our armyworm system. firstly, inefficient transmission of male-killing wolbachia. this occurs when an infected female produces offspring that are both infected and uninfected, resulting in individuals of both infection states having the same mtdna profiles. results from our laboratory cultures provide evidence for inefficient transmission in the s. exempta system, and this phenomenon would certainly help explain the skewed uninfected-haplo <dig> distribution. wolbachia infection intensity within an individual may impact greatly upon the transmission efficiency between mother and offspring, whereby a reduction in infection intensity may lead to a decrease in vertical transmission efficiency and consequently loss of infection  <cit> . in contrast, excessive infection intensity may result in pathology, resulting in negative effects upon host fitness, as seen in the drosophilla melanogaster wolbachia strain wmelpop <cit> . a number of previous studies have identified differences in endosymbiont intensity and infection-load within individual hosts  <cit> . we are currently developing quantitative assays to assess infection intensity and strain identification for the armyworm-wolbachia system.

secondly, wolbachia-infected larvae may be more susceptible to an endemic armyworm baculovirus  <cit> . this would keep a check on wolbachia prevalence in populations by causing greater mortality in wolbachia-infected larvae than non-infected haplo <dig> larvae, thereby further exaggerating the haplo <dig> uninfected:infected ratio. we propose that a combination of these two mechanisms occurs in the field and contributes to maintaining stability of wolbachia and preserving the mtdna haplo <dig> skew within populations of armyworm. in addition, inter-strain wolbachia stability may exist if the three strains are adapted to different 'environments'. armyworm experience huge environmental variations over the course of a season e.g. host density, temperature, food-plant changes, disease challenge, etc. the three wolbachia strains may be differentially adapted to hosts experiencing different conditions e.g. those that do better under low or high density conditions, or they interact differently with baculovirus strains. indeed, in field populations there was no correlation between wexe <dig> prevalence and viral mortality, indicating that wexe <dig> may not increase virus susceptibility in armyworms   <cit> .

s. exempta appears to be paraphyletic at the mtdna level within the genus spodoptera, with >11% nucleotide divergence amongst haplotypes within what observational and nuclear-gene 28s molecular studies indicate is one species. as previously discussed, mtdna is a popular method of identifying species, and assessing biodiversity via barcoding protocols  <cit> . historically these have found intra-specific mtdna diversity to be very low , and inter-specific diversity to be higher . however, an increasing number of studies are finding high levels of mtdna diversity within classical species  <cit> , leading to the hypothesis that cryptic species and races are present in greater numbers than previously thought  <cit> . in addition to this, endosymbionts are capable of driving mtdna introgression from other neighbouring species, thereby confounding the effect of paraphyly within a host species  <cit> , such as that observed previously in drosophila <cit> , acraea butterflies  <cit>  and stomoxys flies  <cit> . this hypothesis may explain the paraphyly patterns observed in our s. exempta haplotype phylogeny.

CONCLUSIONS
all three strains of a wolbachia infecting african armyworm s. exempta were associated with a single host haplotype, haplo <dig>  which comprised  <dig> % of the total samples tested. this study suggests that wolbachia is driving a selective sweep for this particular haplotype, and that based on coi diversity, s. exempta is not a monophyletic group within the spodoptera genus. this study supports previous research highlighting clear implications for the use of mtdna as neutral genetic markers in insects.
