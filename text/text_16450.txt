BACKGROUND
mammalian sirtuins have been identified as homologs of the yeast silent information regulator  <dig>   <cit> , which is an nad-dependent deacetylase and related to metabolism and longevity in yeast  <cit> . seven mammalian sirtuins are included in the family and each has different target proteins. sirtuin  <dig>  is found primarily in the nucleus  <cit>  and plays important roles in maintaining metabolic functions and immune responses through deacetylation of many substrates, such as forkhead transcription factors  <cit> , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, coactivator 1-alpha  <cit>  and the p <dig> subunit of nuclear factor-kappa b   <cit> . sirt <dig> is localized to mitochondria  <cit>  and protects cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death by deacetylating isocitrate dehydrogenase  <dig>  <cit>  and superoxide dismutase  <dig>  <cit> . gene expression and activity of sirtuins are mainly regulated by metabolic states and aging  <cit> . these features of sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> have been studied in metabolic diseases related to aging such as type  <dig> diabetes mellitus   <cit> , fatty liver  <cit> , and heart diseases  <cit> .

prevalence of obesity has increased in cats, and obesity leads to the development of dm  <cit>  and hepatic lipidosis  <cit> . because the clinical, physiological, and pathological features of dm in cats closely resemble those in humans, cats are good animal models for human type  <dig> dm  <cit> . however, very little information is available on cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig>  the aims of this study were to determine the cdna sequences, and examine the sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna expression in several tissues , and to investigate the effects of feeding a high-fat diet  on the sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> expression  in cats.

RESULTS
experiment 1
cdna cloning of cat sirt <dig> and sirt3
cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> were cloned from a cat cerebral cortex cdna library. the cat sirt <dig> cdna consisted of a 63 bp 5′-untranslated region , a 2241 bp open reading frame , which encoded a  <dig> amino acids, and a 1781 bp 3′-utr. the calculated molecular mass of this protein was  <dig>  kda. the cat sirt <dig> cdna sequence consisted of a 54 bp 5′-utr, a 1119 bp orf, which encoded  <dig> amino acids, and a 481 bp 3′-utr. the calculated molecular mass of this protein was  <dig>  kda. both cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> had a potential polyadenylation signal near the 3′-end . sequence alignment of the deduced cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> amino acids indicated that they contained a conserved catalytic core region and exhibited high homology with the corresponding region in sir <dig> like proteins . in addition, similar to others, the cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> core region had a zinc finger and nad+ binding sites. the deduced cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> amino acids sequences were compared with those of other vertebrates, which revealed high sequence similarity . in the phylogenic analysis, the evolutionary positions of cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> were located at the mammalian sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> branches, respectively .

cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna expression profiles in tissues
sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna expression levels in cat tissues were examined by quantitative real time pcr  . in two 3-year-old male cats, expression of both mrnas were observed in a wide range of tissues, including the cerebral cortex, heart, kidneys, liver, skeletal muscles, pancreas, duodenum, spleen, stomach and adipose tissue. high expression levels were observed in the liver and skeletal muscle for sirt <dig> and in the heart for sirt <dig> in cats. in addition, both cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> expression levels in the pancreas were different between individuals.

experiment 2
changes in cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> gene expression after hfd feeding
we fed hfd to healthy cats for 6 weeks to examine the effect of hfd on cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> gene expression. clinical characteristics and plasma metabolite concentrations are provided in table  <dig>  hfd caused significant increases in bw and hepatocellular injury markers  compared with those at baseline . peripheral blood leukocyte sirt <dig> mrna expression levels in cats significantly increased  compared with those at baseline . however, sirt <dig> expression was not significantly different between the two conditions.

discussion
we successfully cloned the cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> cdnas. sequence alignment of the cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> amino acids revealed that they contained a conserved catalytic core domain  <cit> . this core domain included the motifs cxxc-x-cxxc, which are known to be involved in zinc fingers, and conserved in all sir2-like enzymes  <cit> . the other highly conserved motifs gagsxxxgpdfrs, tqnid, and hg create nad+ binding sites  <cit> . sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> were genetically conserved in the phylogenetic tree, and may have an enzymatic function in cats.

sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna are expressed in a variety of tissues in humans  <cit> , mice  <cit> , cows,  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> . in our study, cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna was expressed in various tissues similar to other animals, and high expression levels were observed in the liver and skeletal muscle for sirt <dig> and in the heart for sirt <dig> in cats. in an sirt <dig> heterozygous knockout mice study, acceleration of hepatic steatosis and increased inflammatory gene expressions were observed in the liver  <cit> . liver expression of cat sirt <dig> may be related to control fatty acid homeostasis. since sirt <dig> enhance skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in mice  <cit> , a high sirt <dig> mrna expression levels in the skeletal muscle is considered to be related to glucose metabolism in cats. although sirt <dig> deficient mice appear to have normal activity, they show signs of cardiac hypertrophy at 8 weeks of age  <cit> . cat sirt <dig> expression in the heart may be related to protection against cardiac hypertrophy. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  is the most common heart disease in cats and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with the risk of sudden death  <cit> . therefore, we think it might be interesting to study the relationship between sirt <dig> and hcm in cats. additionally, both sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> expression levels in the pancreas were different between individuals. sirt <dig> regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells  <cit>  and sirt <dig> is suppressed in pancreatic islets isolated from human type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit> . therefore, the expression levels of sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> in the pancreas may be considered to be fluctuating by the metabolic state in cats.

sirtuins are regulated by nutritional status, for instance, caloric restriction up-regulates sirt <dig>  <cit>  and sirt <dig>  <cit>  activity in cultured mammalian cells. in contrast, obesity and hfd reduce sirt <dig>  <cit>  and sirt <dig>  <cit>  activity in vivo. sirt <dig> protein expression is down-regulated in the liver of rat and adipose tissue of mice  <cit> , whereas expression of cat sirt <dig> mrna was up-regulated in peripheral blood leukocytes by hfd. these differences in expression patterns may be considered to be differences in reactivity to hfd between tissues. in our study, early phase liver inflammation was inferred because hepatocellular injury markers were up-regulated by hfd. some inflammatory factors are released in greater amounts from adipose tissue in obese subjects and cause chronic inflammation in animals  <cit> . hfd triggers a pro-inflammatory effect, and induces sirt <dig> cleavage in adipose tissue  <cit> . on the other hand, pro-inflammatory factors enhance the nf-κb signal, and sirt <dig> mrna is also up-regulated as part of a feedback mechanism  <cit> . in addition, sirt <dig> inhibits inflammatory pathways in macrophages to regulate inflammatory responses  <cit> . hence we propose the hypothesis that hfd induces early phase inflammation in tissues such as liver and adipose tissue, and cat sirt <dig> mrna expression levels is up-regulated in peripheral blood leukocytes to suppress inflammation. since peripheral blood leukocytes sirt <dig> mrna level was increase before total cholesterol and glucose level is increase, sirt <dig> may become a candidate marker for early diagnosis of metabolic diseases including obesity in cats.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals the full length cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> by cdna cloning and found that these sirts were highly conserved among vertebrates. and the mrna expression analysis revealed that high expression levels were observed in the liver and skeletal muscle for sirt <dig> and in the heart for sirt <dig> in cats. in addition, both cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> expression levels were different between individuals. our results provide fundamental information to reveal the cat sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> function about relationship of metabolic diseases. furthermore, hfd affected cat sirt <dig> mrna expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. this represent hfd feeding may be related to sirt <dig> mrna expression mechanisms in cat peripheral blood leukocytes.
