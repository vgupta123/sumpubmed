BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family of rna viruses and are a persistent cause of respiratory diseases in animals and humans  <cit> . variants of these viruses have been isolated from a broad range of hosts, including chickens, pigs, human, horses, domestic ducks, and migrant shorebirds  <cit> . they have a single negative-sense rna genome packed into  <dig> gene segments that encode  <dig> or  <dig> viral proteins; however, recent studies suggest that more viral proteins may be produced by some strains  <cit> . constant evolution of influenza viruses may occur through a number of mechanisms, including antigenic drift, genetic shift, defective-interfering particles, and rna molecular recombination  <cit> , and global virus pandemics caused by transmission of novel viruses, such as the  <dig> influenza pandemic, have led to disastrous outcomes  <cit> . activation of the host innate immune system in response to influenza infection triggers phagocytosis for viral pathogen elimination; however, the antiviral response to infection is sometimes ineffective or even detrimental in the host. in fact, studies have implicated the host innate immune system as the cause of severe influenza virulence  <cit> , including the abnormal innate immune response responsible for the atypical virulence of the  <dig> pandemic influenza virus  <cit>  and the highly pathogenic h5n <dig> variant  <cit> .

micrornas  are noncoding rnas 20– <dig> nucleotides long that bind target mirnas to cause their degradation or translational inhibition and thereby regulate various biological processes  <cit> . recently, studies have implicated mirnas in viral replication and have indicated they can both inhibit and promote viral infections  <cit> . expression of mirnas has been reported in response to several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus- <dig>  simian immunodeficiency virus  <cit> , hepatitis b virus  <cit> , hepatitis c virus  <cit> , epstein-barr virus  <cit> , and oncogenic human papillomaviruses  <cit> . furthermore, mirna expression patterns have been profiled in mouse lung and a <dig> cells infected with pandemic influenza virus  <cit> . additionally, differential expression of mirnas has been observed in various animals, including h5n <dig> influenza virus-infected cynomolgus macaque lungs  <cit>  and mouse lungs  <cit> , h1n <dig> virus-infected pigs  <cit> , and avian h5n <dig> influenza virus-infected chickens  <cit> . such studies provide evidence that mirnas play an important role during influenza virus infection. moreover, recent studies have indicated that some cellular mirnas can inhibit influenza virus replication or propagation  <cit> .

studies have shown that the acquisition of virulence in new host through mouse adaptation is associated with mutations in various gene segments  <cit> . commonly identified virulence markers include e627k in pb <dig> and the multibasic cleavage site motif in ha, in addition to mutated pb1-f <dig> and ns <dig> proteins  <cit> . the polymerase gene, pb <dig> gene, is an important determinant of virulence in the hpai h5n <dig> and h7n <dig> viruses  <cit> .

in our previous study to investigate the molecular changes that occur during adaptation of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype to a mammalian host, we serially passaged a wild bird h5n <dig> isolate, a/aquatic bird/korea/w81/ <dig> , in the lungs of mice. in contrast to the parent strain, the resulting mouse-adapted strain  was both highly pathogenic and lethal  <cit> . full length sequencing results showed that nonconserved mutations were observed in six viral genes  of w <dig> resulting in ma <dig>  however, reverse genetic experiments substituting viral genes and mutations demonstrated that the pa gene was a determinant of the enhanced virulence in mice, and that a thr-to-iso substitution at position  <dig> of pa played a key role  <cit> . in growth kinetics studies, ma <dig> showed enhanced replication in mammalian cell lines, and a pa97i mutation in w <dig> was identified to cause such replication. because influenza a virus strains have different sensitivities to different mammalian hosts , it is possible that different host responses may be observed during infection with wild type or mammalian-adapted-avian influenza  virus strains even though they share the same genetic backbones. therefore, in the present study, we compared mirna expression profiles in the lungs of mice infected with wild type, low virulence, avian parental w <dig>  virus or the mouse-adapted highly virulent ma <dig> strain to investigate whether mammalian adaptation of the avian influenza virus could differentially alter the expression of cellular mirnas. specifically, mirnas were assessed at  <dig> and 3 days post infection , and  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed by both viruses at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively, even though many mirnas were found to be commonly induced by both viruses. these results suggested that mammalian adaptation of avian influenza a virus can alter the host mirna expression pattern in lungs of virus-infected mice, and thus these molecules might play important roles in viral replication and pathogenesis. in addition, our results present the feasibility of using mirnas as therapeutic targets in the face of a mammalian-adapted, avian influenza virus infection as inhibition of certain mirnas reduced viral replication and increased survival in the mouse model.

RESULTS
virus titration and clinical manifestations of wild type w <dig> and mouse-adapted variant ma81
to compare the pathogenicity of each virus in infected mice, clinical symptoms, and survival rates were measured for  <dig> dpi and lung viral titers were evaluated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi. the lungs harvested from mice infected with a mouse-adapted variant ma <dig> showed relatively higher virus titers ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  50% tissue culture infectious doses  compared to lung tissues obtained from those inoculated with a wild type w <dig> virus which produced titers ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tcid50/ml . overall, the ma <dig> strain replicated more efficiently in infected mouse lungs than the wild type w <dig> strain.figure  <dig>

all mice infected with ma <dig> showed rapid body weight losses and significant disease symptoms, such as hunched back, ruffled fur, and lethargy until succumbing to death within  <dig> dpi. in contrast, no clinical signs of influenza, including weight loss and death, were evident in mice infected with the wild type w <dig> during the experimental period, and all mice inoculated with w <dig> survived until the end of the experiment . these results clearly demonstrate that mouse-adapted ma <dig> is more virulent and more lethal than the parental w <dig> strain.

differential mirna expression in mouse lungs infected with either wild type w <dig> or mouse-adapted variant ma81
to investigate the changes in the host gene expression profile occurring during adaptation of an avian influenza virus subtype to a mammalian host, global cellular mirna expression patterns in mouse lungs infected with either w <dig> or ma <dig> were compared with those of uninfected controls. in this study, only differentially expressed mirnas with a p <  <dig>  and fold change >  <dig> are described.

a total number of differentially expressed mirnas in mouse lungs infected with w <dig> at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi were presented in figure 2a. in the lungs of mice infected with wild type w <dig> at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> mirnas were differentially upregulated, and  <dig> mirnas were downregulated . at  <dig> dpi, a total of  <dig> mirnas were differentially upregulated, and  <dig> mirnas were downregulated . altogether, the expression of  <dig> mirnas was significantly altered at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas were commonly found at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . when infected with mouse-adapted ma <dig>  a relatively small number of differentially expressed mirnas were identified in the lung  with a total of only  <dig> mirnas being differentially expressed. at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> mirnas were upregulated while  <dig> mirnas were downregulated . at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> mirnas were upregulated, and  <dig> mirnas were downregulated . of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, only  <dig> mirnas were upregulated and  <dig> mirnas were downregulated at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi .figure  <dig>

distinctions in mirna expression between wild type w <dig> and mouse-adapted variant ma <dig> infections
differentially expressed mirnas between mouse lungs infected either with w <dig> or ma <dig> were compared . when comparing the mirna expression profiles in lungs infected with either wild type w <dig> or mouse-adapted variant ma <dig>  it became apparent that the number of differentially expressed mirnas increased over time compared to the controls. specifically, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed mirnas detected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively. out of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, only  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated mirnas were commonly found at  <dig> dpi with both viruses . similarly, at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> out of  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were commonly upregulated, and only  <dig> mirna was commonly downregulated . twenty-seven and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas identified to be commonly presented at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi were presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  of these, only mir-100-5p, mir-130a-5p, mir-146b-3p, mir-147-3p, mir-151-5p, mir-155-3p, mir-223-3p, mir-301a-3p, and mir-495-3p were commonly upregulated at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.figure  <dig>

among the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, we selected  <dig> mirnas with greater than 2-fold differences in expression levels in the lungs of mice that were infected with either w <dig> or ma <dig> compared to mock control infections for in-depth analyses  . these  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas identified to be commonly presented in mouse lungs infected either with w <dig> or ma <dig> at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. notably, expression levels of mir-151-5p, mir-223-3p, mir-147-3p, and mir-155-3p were higher in the lungs of mice infected with the ma <dig> virus than those infected with the w <dig> virus. these  <dig> mirnas were tested to investigate the potential roles of mirnas in virus replication. to verify the expression patterns of the  <dig> selected differentially expressed mirnas in lungs, real-time rt-pcr was conducted, and the similar results  confirmed the upregulation of all  <dig> mirnas with deep sequencing analysis in terms of direction of regulation at each time point .table  <dig>

gene ontology analysis
in order to predict the roles of the selected differentially expressed mirnas in response to w <dig> and ma <dig> influenza virus infection, potential targets of each of  <dig> selected mirnas were predicted using miranda version  <dig> . a total of  <dig> predicted targets were obtained for the differentially expressed mirnas. these predicted targets were subjected to go analysis using david version  <dig> . all enriched go terms of molecular function for the predicted targets of the selected differentially expressed mirnas were shown in the additional file  <dig>  after the cutoff standard of p <  <dig> , a total of  <dig> go terms of molecular function were found to be associated with cell death and immune regulations . ten enriched immune- and cell death-related go terms of molecular function for the mir-147-3p were detected . these enriched go terms included programmed cell death, apoptosis, and regulation of t-helper  <dig> type immune response, lymphocyte activation, lymphocyte differentiation, leukocyte activation, cell death, programmed cell death, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> immune- and cell death-related go terms of molecular function were enriched for the mir-151-5p, mir-155-3p, and mir-223-3p, respectively. these enriched go terms included positive regulation of immune system process, response to wounding, regulation of innate immune response, somatic diversification of immune receptors and immunoglobulins, lymphoid progenitor cell differentiation, immunoglobulin vj recombination, reproductive developmental process, regulation of cell death, programmed cell death, and apoptosis .figure  <dig>

inhibition of mir-147-3p, mir-151-5p, mir-155-3p, and mir-223-3p confers viral pathogenesis in mice
to investigate the possible roles of mirnas in virus replication, we generated anti-mirnas and administered them via intranasal transfection to further evaluate the roles of mir-147-3p, mir-151-5p, mir-155-3p, and mir-223-3p in the pathogenesis of influenza infection in mice. inhibition of mirna expressions was examined by real-time rt-pcr. expression levels of each mirna in the mouse lungs inoculated with ma <dig> after transfection of corresponding mirna inhibitors were significantly decreased compared to those of the lungs inoculated with ma <dig> without mirna inhibitor transfection . in contrast, mirna negative inhibitor control treatment did not significantly affect the expression level of the mirnas tested . when viral loads were measured at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, significantly lower influenza virus titers were observed in the lungs of animals treated with anti-mir-151-5p and anti-mir-223-3p than in untreated controls. in addition, the survival rate of the anti-mir-151-5p and anti-mir-223-3p treated mice significantly increased compared to that of the control group . approximately  <dig> %  and 25%  of mice treated with anti-mir-151-5p and anti-mir-223-3p, respectively, survived until the end of the experiment, whereas all untreated control mice were dead by  <dig> dpi. moreover, the mice treated with anti-mir-151-5p and anti-mir-223-3p began to gain weight starting at  <dig> dpi and rapidly recovered their body weight thereafter . thus, these results indicate that inhibition of mir-151-5p and mir-223-3p reduces influenza replication in the lungs, while the overexpression of these mirnas in the lungs augments influenza infection. in contrast, all the mice treated with anti-mir-147-3p and anti-mir-155-3p lost body weight as quickly as the control mice and died from influenza infection within  <dig> dpi. mice treated with anti-mir-155-3p had a tendency to exhibit higher viral titers than all other groups of mice, although it was not statistically significant compared to negative inhibitor-treated group  . therefore, our results indicate that the inhibition of mir-155-3p expression was detrimental for mice during the pathogenesis of influenza infection, suggesting that overexpression of mir-155-3p might exert a protective function against influenza.figure  <dig>

discussion
mirnas have the potential to regulate gene expression through base pairing with complementary sequences in target mirnas, resulting in translational inhibition or mirna degradation. furthermore, it is now acknowledged that the complexity of diverse disease phenotypes, including viral infections, is linked to the altered expression of host mirnas  <cit> . specifically, viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis b virus, and epstein-barr virus have been shown to alter the expression of host mirnas  <cit> , and mirna expression profiles have been assessed in the context of various disease phenotypes caused by different influenza strains  <cit> . however, our study is unique in that we looked at the differences in phenotypes through making comparisons between a mouse-adapted variant and its parental virus strain that share relatively small differences in viral genetics. in terms of virulence, the a/aquatic bird/korea/ma81/ <dig>   variant proved more pathogenic than the parental a/aquatic bird/korea/w81/ <dig>   strain, as all mice infected with the mouse-adapted virus died within  <dig> dpi while the w81-infected mice survived . this result suggests that even though both viruses have the same genetic backbone, mouse adaptation of an avian influenza virus alters the disease phenotype. in order to determine whether host cell gene expression also differs following infection with these viruses, we compared mirna expression profiles in mouse lungs using a solexa deep sequencing approach. in lungs of infected animals, mirna expression profiles induced by w <dig> and ma <dig> were obtained, and differentially expressed mirnas were compared. while identification of the mechanisms underlying the virulence of ma <dig> will require further study, the results presented here underscore the feasibility of using mirnas as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in the face of a mammalian-adapted, avian influenza virus infection.

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were detected in lungs infected with w <dig> and ma <dig>  respectively . influenza a virus can alter expressions of numerous mirnas, and individual mirnas have the potential to regulate multiple gene expressions. thus, the complexity of regulation of gene expression caused by mirnas greatly expands the number of possible virus-host regulatory interactions  <cit> . since no global patterns of mirna expression in response to virus infection have been uncovered, a focus has been placed on the regulation of gene expression by individual mirnas and their potential roles in disease pathogenesis  <cit> . therefore, we also investigated individual mirnas that were differentially expressed in lungs infected with either w <dig> or ma <dig>  among differentially expressed mirnas, we selected  <dig> mirnas with greater than 2-fold differences in expression levels in lungs infected with either w <dig> or ma <dig> compared to controls for more in-depth analysis. these mirnas include mir-151-5p, mir-223-3p, mir-147-3p, and mir-155-3p . potential functions of the selected differentially expressed mirnas are summarized in table  <dig>  these  <dig> mirnas are known to be involved in cell death or immunity or inflammatory responses. specifically, these mirnas have been implicated in immune responses , viral infection , and cell migration   <cit> .

in our study, while mir-155-3p and mir-223-3p were highly expressed following infection with both w <dig> and ma <dig>  their expression was more than 2-fold greater in pathogenic ma81-infected lungs than in w81-infected lungs. previous studies on expression of mir- <dig> and mir-223-3p in relation to immune responses and viral infections  <cit>  have reported that mir-155-3p expression may inhibit malignant growth and viral infections  <cit> . a role for mir- <dig> in the mammalian immune system was suggested by the finding that immune responses are defective in mir- <dig> knockout mice due to altered lymphocyte differentiation, which is likely a result of disregulated cytokine production  <cit> . in accordance with these findings, our results demonstrate that the inhibition of mir-155-3p expression was detrimental to mice during the pathogenesis of influenza infection. specifically, mice treated with anti-mir-155-3p rapidly lost body weight and died from influenza infection within  <dig> dpi, and they had higher viral titers in the lungs than other groups of mice . although the wide range of biological functions attributed to each mirna during influenza infection precludes the conclusion that mir-155-3p is responsible for induction of the cellular antiviral effect, the results from our study along with those from thai et al., at least, indicate that overexpression of mir-155-3p is one of the defense mechanisms working against influenza infection  <cit> . another study suggested the possible regulation of influenza virus infection by mir- <dig> in chickens due to its targeting of the chicken anti-influenza gene mx <dig> and activation of the juk pathway  <cit> .

multiple functions for mir-223-3p have been previously reported  <cit> , and mir-223-3p is known to promote granulocytic differentiation  <cit> . the current study confirms highly upregulated expression of mir-223-3p during influenza a virus infections, which has previously been reported following infection with pathogenic  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza in mouse lungs infected with h5n <dig> and in pig lungs infected with h1n <dig>  <cit> . additionally, significantly lower influenza virus titers were measured in the influenza-infected lungs treated with anti-mir-223-3p than in non-treated lungs. in addition, 25% of mice treated with anti-mir-223-3p regained their body weight and survived lethal influenza infection . these results indicate that overexpression of mir-223-3p is detrimental to the host during influenza infection. thus, inhibition of mir-223-3p might reduce the pathogenicity of this influenza virus in the host during infection. although identification of the precise roles of mir-155-3p and mir-223-3p during influenza infection will require further study, based on the results of this study and several others, it is apparent that mir-155-3p and mir-223-3p contribute to pathogenicity  <cit> .

potential roles of mir-151-5p may be related to the previously identified function of this molecule in the regulation of tumor cell migration and spreading of hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . ding et al. highlighted the detrimental role of overexpressed mir-151-5p in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma . in their study, significantly increased hcc cell migration and invasion were observed when mir-151-5p, together with its host gene , was overexpressed. in our study, the expression of mir-151-5p in lungs infected with the influenza virus was found to be upregulated at all time points examined. furthermore, inhibition of mir-151-5p expression reduced influenza virus titers compared to those of infected lungs from mice not treated with the inhibitor, and 30% of mice treated with anti-mir-151-5p regained their body weight and survived influenza infection . altogether, we can speculate that the silencing of mir-151-5p expression alters the pathogenesis of the influenza virus and promotes the antiviral ability of the host during influenza infection. in this study, the expression of mir-151-5p was found to be upregulated at all time points assessed, in contrast to reports that its expression was downregulated in response to infection with h1n <dig> and h5n <dig>  <cit> . this discrepancy may be due to the different experimental design. for example, we used lung tissues to evaluate expression of each mirna, while tambyah et al. analyzed mirna expression levels in human blood. also, avian influenza virus was inoculated into myxovirus resistance  protein-deficient c57bl/ <dig> mice in this study because avian strains are more susceptible to the antiviral effect of mx proteins, while the other studies used human influenza virus and different animals.

in addition, expression of mir-147-3p was upregulated at all times in lungs infected with either w <dig> or ma <dig>  mir-147-3p has been shown to be associated with toll-like receptor stimulation and regulation of murine macrophage inflammatory responses  <cit> . even with their known immunological functions , downregulation of mir-147-3p or mir-155-3p by each mirna inhibitor could not alter the viral replication and mortality in infected mice. therefore, elucidation of the potential roles of mir-147-3p in host cells during influenza infection will require further study.

CONCLUSIONS
the importance of mirnas as gene regulators in the host during influenza infections has been broadly defined, although the exact functions of these molecules in viral pathogenesis remain to be determined. the study presented here highlights differentially expressed mirnas in mouse lungs infected with wild type, low pathogenic h5n <dig>  and its mouse-adapted, highly pathogenic variant. furthermore, this study suggests that some of the mirnas identified are capable of boosting the pathogenesis of influenza. thus, some of these mirnas may be useful as potential prognostic or therapeutic targets in the face of avian influenza a virus infections in mammalian hosts.
