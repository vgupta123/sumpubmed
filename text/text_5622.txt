BACKGROUND
cellular differentiation is an essential process of normal development by which a stem or progenitor cell becomes a post-mitotic, specialized cell with unique morphology and function. in addition, it has long been recognized that differentiated cells of both normal and tumor origin are defective in the dna damage response and repair at the global level, displaying a marked increase in sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other dna damaging agents  <cit> . consistent with these observations, recent studies have shown that brain and breast cancer stem cells, a small subpopulation of tumor cells thought to be responsible for initiating and sustaining tumor growth  <cit> , are more resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy than bulk tumor cells  <cit> . particularly interesting is the observation that inhibition of dna damage checkpoint kinases can reverse the radioresistance of glioma stem cells  <cit> . thus, a molecular understanding of cellular differentiation may suggest new therapeutic strategies that target both cell proliferation and the dna damage response.

among the genes that have a critical role in the control of cellular differentiation are the hox gene family members. hox genes encode a family of transcription factors that function as master regulators of morphogenesis and cell fate specification  <cit> . dysregulation of hox gene expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers of different tissue types. in most tumor types, hox genes function as oncogenes to promote cancer development such as hoxa <dig> in leukemia and hoxb <dig> in ovarian and breast cancers  <cit> . however, in neuroblastoma, a common childhood malignant tumor of the sympathetic nervous system  <cit> , there is evidence suggesting that hox genes may function as tumor suppressors  <cit> . particularly, downregulation of hoxc <dig> expression is significantly associated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma patients  <cit> .

neuroblastoma cells can be induced to undergo neuronal differentiation by serum deprivation  <cit> , nerve growth factor  <cit>  or retinoic acid   <cit> . ra-induced neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells is a well-established model for molecular investigation of neuronal differentiation  <cit> . we recently reported that ra-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells required the activation of several hox genes  <cit> . among them, hoxc <dig> appeared to be a major mediator of ra action in neuroblastoma cells. hoxc <dig> expression was upregulated by ra, and silencing hoxc <dig> expression conferred resistance to ra-induced differentiation. importantly, ectopic hoxc <dig> expression alone was sufficient to induce growth arrest and morphologic differentiation in neuroblastoma cells, fully recapitulating the neuronal differentiation phenotype induced by ra  <cit> .

differentiated neuroblastoma cells morphologically and functionally resemble mature peripheral neurons characterized by g <dig> arrest, extensive neurite outgrowth, and significant resting potential. it has long been observed that differentiated neuroblastoma cells are highly sensitive to uv and x-ray radiation with a significantly reduced rate of dna damage repair  <cit> . the molecular basis for the differentiation-induced radiosensitivity is not well understood. the biological functions of ra are mediated by multiple isotypes of ra receptors  and retinoid x receptors , which form rar/rxr heterodimers that bind ra response elements in the regulatory regions of ra target genes and regulate their transcription  <cit> . the complexity of multiple rars and rxrs involved in the action of ra presents a daunting challenge to dissect the molecular mechanism that coordinates the diverse cellular events associated with differentiation. thus, the finding that hoxc <dig> alone is able to initiate a robust transcriptional program that drives neuronal differentiation provides a unique experimental system for this investigation. in this study, we conducted genome-wide profiling of the hoxc9-initiated transcriptional program. our investigation reveals that hoxc <dig> directly regulates the expression of three major sets of genes that separately control neuronal differentiation, cell cycle progression, and the dna damage response.

RESULTS
gene expression profiling of hoxc9-induced neuronal differentiation
to gain a molecular understanding of hoxc9-induced differentiation, we conducted microarray gene expression profiling of human neuroblastoma be-c/tet-off/myc-hoxc <dig> cells, which express myc-tagged human hoxc <dig> and undergo neuronal differentiation in the absence of doxycycline  <cit>  . the profiling analysis identified a total of  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed , with  <dig> genes being upregulated and  <dig>  genes downregulated . gene annotation enrichment analysis revealed that hoxc9-induced differentiation is characterized by a genome-wide coordination in transcriptional regulation of genes that control neuronal differentiation, cell cycle progression, and the dna damage response.

global upregulation of neuronal genes
gene ontology  analysis of the  <dig> hoxc9-upregulated genes by david  <cit>  revealed that they were significantly enriched for genes that control nervous system development such as neuron generation and differentiation, axonogenesis, and synapse formation and organization  ≤1%). a total of  <dig> hoxc9-responsive genes were involved in nervous system development , accounting for approximately 12% of the  <dig> genes upregulated by hoxc <dig>  we obtained similar results with gene set enrichment analysis , which showed significant enrichment of gene sets involved in synaptogenesis and neuron differentiation among the genes upregulated by hoxc <dig> . particularly significant was the activation of ascl <dig>  gfra <dig>  ret, and ntn <dig> . ascl <dig>  a member of the basic helix-loop-helix  family of transcription factors, is a master regulator in the generation and differentiation of sympathetic neurons  <cit> . gfra <dig> encodes the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  family receptor alpha  <dig> , which forms a receptor complex with ret that preferentially binds the gdnf family ligand artemin. this receptor signaling has a critical role in embryonic development of the sympathetic nervous system, promoting the survival, differentiation, axonal outgrowth, and target innervation of sympathetic neurons  <cit> . ntn <dig>  belongs to a family of extracellular proteins that promote axon growth and migration during the development of the nervous system  <cit> . ingenuity pathways analysis  further revealed a network of hoxc9-upregulated genes relevant to the development and function of sympathetic neurons . together, these analyses demonstrate that hoxc <dig> activates a large number of neuronal genes, providing the molecular mechanism for its ability to induce neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.

global downregulation of cell cycle and dna repair genes
go analysis of the  <dig>  hoxc9-downregulated genes revealed that they were remarkably enriched for genes that control cell cycle progression and the dna damage response . the analysis identified  <dig> genes involved in cell cycle regulation and  <dig> genes in the dna damage response . similarly, gsea showed that among the genes downregulated by hoxc <dig>  those regulating mitotic cell cycle, dna replication and dna repair were significantly enriched . ipa further revealed that the downregulated genes include most of cyclin  and cyclin-dependent kinase  genes, and genes that control dna replication, mitosis, double-strand break  repair, base excision repair , nucleotide excision repair , mismatch repair , and fanconi anemia -mediated repair . these findings suggest that global downregulation of cell cycle and dna repair genes is the primary cause of the cell cycle arrest and attenuation of the dna damage response associated with neuronal differentiation.

genome-wide mapping of hoxc9-binding sites
we next asked how hoxc <dig> coordinates the expression of distinct sets of genes: the upregulation of genes critical for nervous system development and the downregulation of genes essential for cell cycle progression and the dna damage response. mechanistically, hoxc <dig> could function through a few master transcription factors, which in turn regulate their own subsets of target genes that work together to drive differentiation. alternatively, hoxc <dig> could directly regulate distinct sets of genes to coordinate the cellular events associated with differentiation. to test these models, we conducted two independent anti-hoxc <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation assays followed by massively parallel sequencing of the enriched dna fragments  for genome-wide mapping of hoxc9-binding sites. we identified a total of  <dig>  hoxc9-binding peaks with fdr less than 1% . scatter plot analysis  and chip-seq tag profiles  demonstrated that the mapping data were highly reproducible between the two independent hoxc <dig> chip-seq samples. we next analyzed the distribution of hoxc9-binding peaks within the genome that was classified into functional categories including promoters , 5’-untranslated regions , exons, introns, 3’-utrs, downstream , and intergenic regions . the analysis revealed that a majority of hoxc9-binding peaks were localized in introns  and intergenic regions  . however, after normalization to the size of these functional regions, it became clear that hoxc9-binding peaks were highly enriched in gene promoters and 5’-utrs . analysis of the sequences covered by hoxc9-binding peaks with the motif-finding program meme revealed that the most enriched binding motif  corresponds to the drosophila abd-b motif  and is highly homologous to the mouse hoxc9-binding motif   <cit> . hoxc <dig> is a mammalian ortholog of the drosophila hox protein abd-b. thus, myc-tagged hoxc <dig> binds to cognate sequences in human neuroblastoma cells.

genome-wide identification of hoxc <dig> target genes
the chip-seq assay revealed that a total of  <dig>  genes contained at least one hoxc9-binding peak within 5-kb upstream or downstream of their genomic loci . we next combined the anti-hoxc <dig> chip-seq data with the hoxc <dig> microarray data to generate a list of genes that were bound by hoxc <dig> and whose expression levels were significantly changed as a result of hoxc <dig> induction . the analysis revealed that  <dig> genes or  <dig> % of the  <dig>  hoxc9-responsive genes are direct targets of hoxc <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> genes being upregulated and downregulated, respectively . go analysis of hoxc <dig> direct target genes revealed a transcriptional program characterized by coordinated regulation of genes critical for neuron differentiation, cell cycle progression, and the dna damage response.

hoxc <dig> directly induces a large number of neuronal genes
the only sets of genes that were significantly enriched among the upregulated hoxc <dig> direct target genes are those exclusively involved in nervous system development, particularly the generation and differentiation of neurons and axonogenesis . the  <dig> hoxc <dig> direct target genes account for  <dig> %  of the hoxc9-responsive genes involved in nervous system development . among them are ascl <dig>  gfra <dig>  ret, and ntn <dig>  figure 4b shows the chip-seq tag profiles of hoxc <dig> binding to the promoter regions of gfra <dig>  ret, and ntn <dig>  as discussed above, these genes have a critical role in sympathetic neurogenesis and axonogenesis.

hoxc <dig> directly represses a large number of genes essential for cell cycle progression and the dna damage response
go analysis of the downregulated hoxc <dig> direct target genes revealed that they were significantly enriched for genes that control cell cycle progression and the dna damage response , enrichment fold ≥  <dig> , fdr ≤ 1%). the analysis identified  <dig> cell cycle genes that were directly repressed by hoxc <dig> , accounting for  <dig> %  of the hoxc9-responsive genes involved in cell cycle regulation . it was particularly striking that the vast majority of the hoxc9-repressed cell cycle genes are involved in the control of the m phase  and dna replication  . figure 5b and c show the association of hoxc <dig> with the promoter regions of representative cell cycle genes, including cdc45l and mcm <dig> , and ccnb <dig> and cdca <dig> . cdc45l and mcm <dig> are components of the replicative complex that catalyzes dna replication during the s phase  <cit> , while cdca <dig>  also known as borealin, is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex essential for mitosis and cell division  <cit> .

we also identified  <dig> genes associated with the dna damage response that were directly repressed by hoxc <dig> , accounting for  <dig> %  of the hoxc9-responsive genes involved in the dna damage response. figure 5d shows the binding of hoxc <dig> to the promoter of fancm and to both the promoter and 3’ region of fen <dig>  fancm is a component of the fancm–faap24–mhf protein complex that binds to dna with interstrand cross-links and is responsible for recruiting the fa core complex to the damaged site  <cit> . fen <dig>  is essential for dna replication and repair by removing rna and dna 5' flaps  <cit> .

collectively, these findings suggest that hoxc <dig> directly regulates the expression of distinct sets of genes to coordinate the molecular and cellular processes characteristic of neuronal differentiation.

hoxc <dig> targets e2f <dig> to the promoters of cell cycle genes
we next sought to determine the molecular basis for hoxc <dig> regulation of gene expression by identifying hoxc9-interacting proteins. we used a myc-tag antibody to isolate myc-hoxc <dig> and its associated proteins from nuclear extracts of be-c/tet-off/myc-hoxc <dig> cells cultured in the absence of doxycycline for  <dig> days . mass spectrometric analysis of two independent samples identified e2f <dig> as a hoxc9-interacting protein , a well characterized transcriptional repressor that plays a major role in repressing e2f-responsive genes essential for cell proliferation  <cit> . it is known that e2f family proteins  share the same core consensus g/ctttg/c binding site  <cit> . interestingly, gsea revealed significant enrichment of the e2f-binding motif among the genes downregulated by hoxc <dig> . taken together, these observations suggest that e2f <dig> has an important role in hoxc9-mediated repression of cell cycle genes.

to corroborate the finding of mass spectrometry, we performed co-immunoprecipitation  experiments using nuclear extracts from be-c/tet-off/myc-hoxc <dig> cells cultured in the absence of doxycycline for  <dig> days. the myc-tag antibody, but not control igg, precipitated myc-hoxc <dig> and e2f <dig> . reciprocally, an e2f <dig> antibody precipitated e2f <dig> and myc-hoxc <dig> . we next performed size-exclusion chromatography using the same nuclear extracts. immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of hoxc <dig>  in two complexes: the larger complex  had an estimated molecular mass of ~ <dig>  kda and the other  of ~250 kda . a significant amount of endogenous e2f <dig>  co-eluted with the  <dig> -kda hoxc <dig> complex, whereas meis <dig> , which interacts with hox proteins and functions as a hox cofactor  <cit> , exclusively co-eluted with the  <dig> kda-hoxc <dig> complex . co-ip experiments using pooled fractions confirmed the association of hoxc <dig> with e2f <dig> within the larger complex .

to determine whether the hoxc9-e2f <dig> interaction plays a role in recruiting e2f <dig> to hoxc <dig> target genes in vivo, we performed anti-e2f <dig> chip using be-c/tet-off/myc-hoxc <dig> cells before and after hoxc <dig> induction. hoxc <dig> induction had no apparent effect on e2f <dig> expression as determined by microarray gene expression profiling . chip-qpcr assay revealed that e2f <dig> was recruited to specific promoter regions of the cell cycle genes ccnb <dig> and cdca <dig> only after hoxc <dig> induction . by contrast, no significant binding of e2f <dig> to the nefm promoter was observed before and after hoxc <dig> induction . as reported previously, nefm is a neuronal gene directly activated by hoxc <dig> during differentiation  <cit>  . together, these data suggest that elevated levels of hoxc <dig> facilitate the formation of a repressive complex with e2f <dig>  which is then recruited to cell cycle but not neuronal genes during differentiation.

e2f <dig> is essential for hoxc9-induced cell cycle arrest and transcriptional repression of cell cycle genes
to determine the functional significance of the hoxc9-e2f <dig> interaction, we examined the effect of e2f <dig> knockdown on hoxc9-induced growth arrest. we depleted e2f <dig> using short hairpin rna  sequences targeting different coding regions of the human e2f <dig> gene . cells with e2f <dig> knockdown were highly resistant to hoxc9-induced g <dig> arrest, showing continued cell proliferation  and cell cycle progression  following hoxc <dig> induction. this was accompanied by a marked decrease in the population of cells in the g <dig> phase and a significant increase in the population of cells in the s phase . in addition, e2f <dig> knockdown largely abrogated the ability of hoxc <dig> to repress cyclin a <dig> and b <dig> expression, but had no significant effect on hoxc <dig> induction of nefm , a finding consistent with the observation of no significant e2f <dig> binding to the nefm promoter during hoxc9-induced differentiation . together, these findings identify an essential and specific role for e2f <dig> in hoxc <dig> induction of growth arrest and repression of cell cycle genes.

discussion
in this report, we present evidence for a master regulator of development with the capacity to coordinate diverse cellular events characteristic of neuronal differentiation by simultaneously and directly regulating distinct sets of genes . through gene expression profiling, we show that hoxc9-induced neuronal differentiation is characterized at the molecular level by transcriptional regulation of  <dig>  genes, with global activation of genes that promote nervous system development and repression of genes that are essential for cell cycle progression and the dna damage response. moreover, through a combination of genome-wide mapping of hoxc <dig> binding sites and gene expression profiling, we show that hoxc <dig> directly regulates the expression of  <dig> genes, ~40% of the  <dig>  hoxc9-responsive genes, including a large number of genes required for neuronal differentiation, cell cycle progression and the dna damage response. finally, we identify an essential role for e2f <dig> in hoxc <dig> repression of cell cycle genes and induction of g <dig> arrest.

our findings that hoxc <dig> can both activate and repress gene transcription are consistent with previous observations from the study of spinal cord development in chick and mouse embryos. in the developing spinal cord, hoxc <dig> functions as a transcription activator to promote the fate of preganglionic motor column  neurons  <cit> , most likely through its interaction with the transcription factor foxp <dig>  <cit> . however, hoxc <dig> can also specify the fate of hypaxial motor column  neurons by repressing the hox genes that promote the switch of hmc neurons to the lateral motor column  neurons  <cit> . importantly, our study further demonstrated that within the same population of neuroblastoma cells, hoxc <dig> could simultaneously activate the genes that promote neuronal differentiation and repress the genes that are essential for cell cycle progression and the dna damage response. while the molecular basis for the transcription activator function of hoxc <dig> in neuroblastoma cells remain to be defined, we showed that the ability of hoxc <dig> to repress cell cycle genes depended on its interaction with the transcription repressor e2f <dig>  a member of the e2f family of transcription factors that have a critical role in the control of cell proliferation  <cit> .

cellular differentiation is tightly linked to cell cycle exit, with the differentiated cell containing the g <dig> content of dna. the molecular mechanism that couples cell cycle exit and differentiation is not well understood, although it is generally recognized that cell cycle regulators influence differentiation, and cell fate determinants influence the cell cycle  <cit> . a primary example is the cdk inhibitor p27kip <dig> as a key regulator that links cell cycle exit and differentiation during development. p27kip <dig> induces g <dig> arrest by associating with cdk/cyclin complexes and inhibits their kinase activity  <cit> . overexpression of p27xic <dig>  a xenopus homolog of p27kip <dig>  in xenopus retina glial progenitor cells promotes both cell cycle exit and differentiation  <cit> . knockout and overexpression studies also demonstrate an important role of p27kip <dig> in neuronal differentiation in the mouse cerebral cortex by stabilizing neurogenin  <dig>  <cit> , a proneural bhlh transcription factor with a central role in cortical neurogenesis  <cit> . on the other hand, cell fate determinants can also modulate the expression of p27kip <dig> for coordinated regulation of cell cycle exit and differentiation. for instance, drosophila proneural bhlh proteins cooperate with epidermal growth factor signaling to directly activate the transcription of dapaco, a homolog of p21cip/p27kip <dig>  during the differentiation of photoreceptor cells  <cit> .

our findings suggest an alternative mechanism for coupling cell cycle exit and differentiation. hoxc <dig> does not regulate the expression of cdk inhibitors, including p27kip <dig> and p21cip, and overexpression of either p27kip <dig> or p21cip fails to stop the proliferation of be-c cells  <cit> . rather, hoxc <dig> induces g <dig> arrest by directly repressing a large number of genes essential for cell cycle progression through the s to m phases, including cyclin b <dig>  cdca <dig>  cdca <dig>  bub1b, mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  this transcriptional repression function of hoxc <dig> requires e2f <dig>  we found that hoxc <dig> interacts with e2f <dig> and recruits it specifically to the promoters of cell cycle genes. e2f <dig> lacks a transactivation domain and functions as a transcriptional repressor for e2f-responsive genes that drive cell proliferation  <cit> . mechanistically, e2f <dig> interacts with chromatin modifiers with transcription repressor activity to establish a repressive chromatin structure. these chromatin modifiers include the dna methyltransferase dnmt3b  <cit>  and polycomb-group  proteins  <cit> . in our study, we identified hoxc <dig> and e2f <dig> within a complex of approximately  <dig>  kda. whether this complex contains chromatin modifiers is currently under investigation.

terminal cell differentiation is also tightly associated with a global reduction in dna damage repair activities  <cit> . the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. it has been reported that e <dig> ubiquitin-activating enzyme can complement nucleotide-excision repair deficiency in extracts from differentiated macrophages, suggesting a role of ubiquitination in the control of the dna damage response during differentiation  <cit> . our study revealed that in hoxc9-induced neuronal differentiation, attenuation of the dna damage response resulted from global transcriptional repression of dna repair genes. this finding provides a molecular mechanism for the long observed differentiation-induced radiosensitivity in neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . for hoxc9-induced differentiation, a total of  <dig> genes with functions in the dna damage response were significantly downregulated. these genes are involved in all types of dna damage checkpoints and repair pathways. importantly, we show that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes are direct targets of hoxc <dig>  thus, to a large extent, hoxc <dig> coordinates neuronal differentiation and attenuation of dna repair activities by simultaneously activating neuronal genes and repressing dna repair genes. since the dna damage response and dna replication machineries share many components, we speculate that the downregulation of dna repair genes during differentiation is a consequence of repression of cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in dna replication.

the stem cell model of cancer attributes cancer growth to a subpopulation of cancer stem cells. it has been shown recently that cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, as a result of enhanced checkpoint activation and more effective dna damage repair  <cit> . since differentiation is associated with global downregulation of dna repair activities, a combination of differentiation-inducing agents and irradiation or chemotherapy may prove to be a more effective therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer stem cells.

CONCLUSIONS
using neuroblastoma cell differentiation as an experimental system, we delineate a molecular mechanism by which hoxc <dig> coordinates diverse cellular processes associated with differentiation by directly activating and repressing the transcription of distinct sets of genes.
