BACKGROUND
over the last decade, it has become clear that a single bacterial strain is not always representative of the whole species. moreover, the range of physiological and virulence properties of a given bacterial pathogen most often relies on a particular subset of genes which are responsible for strain-specific lifestyles and may not be equally distributed within the species  <cit> . comparative genomics provide a powerful approach to understanding what makes a pathogen but the question of how it can describe a bacterial species is still debated  <cit> . within a single bacterial species, mathematical models are predicting the discovery of new genes even after sequencing hundreds of different genomes  <cit> .

the genus mycoplasma includes the smallest self-replicative bacterium, m. genitalium, which genome was among the first sequenced  <cit> . it belongs to the class mollicutes which regressive evolution from gram-positive ancestors has been marked by drastic genome downsizing. as a result, contemporary mycoplasmas have limited metabolic capacities and are among the most evolved prokaryotes as they localised on some of the longest branch of the phylogenetic tree of fully sequenced organisms  <cit> . while our genomic era is accumulating a tremendous amount of data with more than  <dig> microbial genomes currently available in public databases , only  <dig> other mycoplasma genomes have been completed  <cit> , including  <dig> strains of the m. hyopneumoniae species  <cit> . this number is surprising low owing the small size of mycoplasma genomes and the several species that are relevant for public and animal health because they are known as pathogenic for man or for a wide range of animals  <cit> .

recently, genome sequencing of the m. agalactiae type strain has shown that a significant portion of its genome  has undergone horizontal gene transfer  with members of the phylogenetically distant "mycoides" cluster  <cit> . this cluster includes a number of mycoplasma species which are, like m. agalactiae, important ruminant pathogens and the nature of the exchanged genes suggests that some may play a role in mycoplasma-host interactions. while this first evidence for large hgt in mycoplasmas is offering possible new means for host-adaptation, it has changed our view on the evolution of these minimal bacteria, which is not only driven by gene loss but also by gene flow between organisms sharing a same host  <cit> . based on previous studies on m. agalactiae genetic diversity, the species appears to be fairly homogeneous with little intra-species genetic variation and most of the isolates resembling the type strain pg <dig>  <cit> . one of these studies however pointed toward a subset of strains having particular genetic features also found in m. bovis, a cattle pathogen closely related to the ovine-caprine m. agalactiae, but not in pg <dig> or in pg2-like strains  <cit> . one of these particular strains, namely  <dig>  turned out to harbour  a putative integrative conjugative element, ice, of  <dig> kpb which occurrence is low in the m. agalactiae species but high in m. bovis  <cit> ,  a different repertoire of genes encoding surface lipoproteins known as the vpmas  <cit> , and  other genetic elements yet to be characterized  <cit> . while the  <dig> and pg <dig> strains have both been isolated from spain, data accumulated so far tend to indicate that each stands at one end of the genetic spectrum encountered in the m. agalactiae species.

inter-strain whole genome comparison within a mycoplasma species has been carried once for an important pathogen of swine, m. hyopneumoniae. this study has provided evidence of intraspecific rearrangements resulting in strain-specific gene clusters as well as clues to factors related to pathogenicity  <cit> . to further comprehend the genome plasticity and the mechanisms responsible in mycoplasmas for intra-species genetic diversity, the genome of m. agalactiae strain  <dig> was fully sequenced and compared in this study with that of the pg <dig> type strain  <cit> . although m. agalactiae is an important pathogen of small ruminants  <cit> , little is known regarding its virulence or pathogenicity factors. since all mycoplasmas lack a cell wall, the surface of their membrane acts as the primary interface in the interaction with the host and the environment. for instance, a number of m. agalactiae surface components has been shown to stimulate the host humoral response and includes lipoproteins such as the p <dig>  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit>  and the vpma family  <cit> . except for p <dig>  all displayed a certain degree of variability in expression either in clonal population as for the phase-variable vpmas  <cit>  or among strains as shown for the p <dig> which promoter is mutated in the p30-negative  <dig> strain  <cit> . in this study, high-throughput identification of proteins expressed under laboratory conditions in m. agalactiae strain pg <dig> and  <dig> was performed by a shotgun approach based on 1d sds-page protein fractionation followed by proteolyses and nanolc-ms/ms. these proteomic data sets were used to validate genome annotation and, by comparative analyses, to further detect rare events that may be responsible for surface diversification. the combination of comparative genomics with comparative proteomics revealed that both large and localized events are shaping the m. agalactiae population structure which one might be much more dynamic than first expected from their reduced genomes.

RESULTS
whole genome and proteome comparison
whole genome sequencing of the m. agalactiae strain  <dig> revealed that it is composed of  <dig> . <dig> kbp and thus, is ca. <dig> kpb larger than the genome of the pg <dig> type strain  <cit>  . the annotated genome of  <dig> displays a total of  <dig> cds for only  <dig> in pg <dig> and whole proteome analyses of both strains identified a global set of  <dig> as being expressed under laboratory conditions in complex, axenic media . of these expressed cds,  <dig> were detected in only one strain  and  <dig> in both. among these,  <dig> were annotated as hypothetical,  <dig> were related to hypothetical abc transporter while most of the remaining corresponded to house keeping genes. these data indicate that ca. 60% of the m. agalactiae predicted cds products were confirmed by the global proteomic approach. in a recent study by demina et al.  <cit> , a same proportion of the m. gallisepticum annotated proteins was found to be expressed using similar approaches. whether the remaining annotated cds of m. agalactiae would be expressed or detected under different conditions is not known but it is unlikely that they all correspond to false orf. comparison of the two genomes using the molligen dot plot, the vista and the act softwares revealed an almost perfect synteny with no major genome rearrangement but with a number of regions being prominently different . these correspond to  mobile genetic elements,  restriction modification systems, and  families of gene encoding surface proteins. as described below, these regions account for most of the difference in cds content observed in between pg <dig> and  <dig> 

data were extracted from the molligen database http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/molligen/.

a one cds, mag <dig>  was annotated as transposase and was detected by proteomics analysis in this study but no inverted repeat sequences could be found.

role of the mobilome in m. agalactiae genetic diversity and genome plasticity
analyses of the  <dig> genome revealed the presence of three large regions  that correspond to an ice element previously identified in this strain  <cit> . the three ice copies were designated icea5632-i, -ii and -iii, with ice-i corresponding to that previously published, and represented a total of about  <dig> kbp. in addition, two smaller regions designated icea5632-iv and -v were detected that relate to the degenerated, single ice form found in strain pg <dig>  <cit>  and that appear to be ices vestiges as suggested by their reduced size and the presence of insertion sequences and pseudogenes. predicted proteins encoded by these vestiges were designated according to our previous nomenclature . interestingly, while phylogenetic and blast analyses indicate that icea5632-i to-iii are related to the icef of mycoplasma fermentans strain pg <dig>  <cit> , the icea5632-iv and -v vestiges and the degenerated iceapg <dig> are somewhat similar to the icec of m. capricolum; in particular, they all contain a cds with no predicted function, cdsz, that is not found in icea5632-i to -iii nor in icef. icea5632-iv also contains a cds, cds <dig>  which is present as a pseudogene in both the iceapg <dig> and icec but is absent from the large copies icea5632-i to iii. the icea copies i to iv also contain two cds widely conserved in mycoplasma ices, cds <dig> and cds <dig> . icea left and right borders of the icea have been experimentally defined as ggaa--ttcc for copy-i  <cit>  and an identical inverted repeat also flanked copies-ii and -iii. the high level of sequence conservation between the two m. agalactiae genomes allowed defining the insertion points of the  <dig> large ice copies in the  <dig> chromosome which correspond to intergenic regions in pg <dig>  although ice insertions do not result in apparent gene disruption, the targeted regions seem to be prone to instability: the copy -i is located next to a conserved insertion sequence  present as a pseudogene in both strains but showing some sequence divergence; the copy -iii is also in the vicinity of an is present only in strain  <dig> and which is inserted next to a conserved trna gene. the copy -ii is inserted next to a predicted lipoprotein gene  showing clear sequence divergence as the two predicted proteins have only  <dig> % identities. the three ice copies i-iii are flanked by an almost perfect  <dig> bp direct repeat which is most likely generated during the integration process. alignment of icea-i, -ii and -iii dna sequences from the first g of the ggaa repeat to the last c of the ttcc repeat showed that there are highly similar, presenting only  <dig> to  <dig> snps. this suggests that the copies originated from subsequent excision and integration events, possibly during chromosomal replication or by exchange within the population. snps resulted in generating  two pseudogenes corresponding to cds <dig> of copy ii and cds <dig> of copy iii,  truncation of cds <dig> in copy ii and  insertion of an asn codon in a stretch of repeated aat  in cds <dig> of copy i. overall,  <dig> iceas account for  <dig> different cds that are not present in pg <dig>  with the products of two detected by ms/ms in the triton-x <dig> fraction of  <dig> .

other mobile elements were found in the  <dig> genome but not in pg <dig> and correspond to multiple copies of two is elements that both belong to the is <dig> family. the location of these elements relative to their flanking cds is shown in figure  <dig>  the is element, ismag <dig>  has previously been described in some m. agalactiae strains  <cit>  and an isoform was also described in m. bovis   <cit> . in  <dig>  this element occurs in  <dig> copies with  <dig> that localized either next to genomic islands encoding a repertoire of variable surface lipoproteins  or to regions associated with hgt . the second type of is, ismag <dig>  resembles ismbov <dig> recently described  <cit>  and is found only in three copies, none of which seems to truncate or disrupt a cds.

in silico analyses further indicate that ismag <dig> occurrence most likely disrupts gene expression in only three cases. in the first case, the insertion has taken place in between a dcm gene encoding a cytosine-specific dna-methyltransferase sau96i  and a type ii specific deoxyribonuclease sau96i-like gene . both genes are absent from pg <dig> but are found next to each other in m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc in which they most likely occur as an operon. these genes are highly similar to those found in  <dig> with ca. 85% and 78% similarity, respectively, with higher divergence in the n-terminal of  <dig> sau96i-like gene. interestingly, a global proteomic approach  detected several specific peptides of the cytosine-specific methyl transferase encoded by maga <dig> but none corresponding to the sau96i-like gene supporting the hypothesis that the is occurrence at its 5'end may affect its expression. in the second case, is insertion at the 3' end of maga <dig> would result in truncating the product by more than 50% when compared to the situation found in pg <dig>  the third case relates to maga <dig> and maga <dig> which are separated by an is and which have been annotated as two distinct pseudogenes because they are highly similar to either the n- or the c-terminal part of the mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum glycosyl transferase . in pg <dig>  homologs to maga <dig> and maga <dig> also exist as pseudogenes although no is is involved.

finally, two vestiges of transposase having similarities with that of ismmy <dig> of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc were detected in the  <dig> genome; one located next to an ice element while the other was found next to a truncated hypothetical protein that displays a duf <dig> motif  and that is predicted to have undergone hgt with member of the "mycoides" cluster species.

in most cases, is elements were flanked by direct repeated sequences of  <dig> nt for ismag <dig> and of  <dig> nt for ismag <dig> that indicated a single is insertion event. exceptions were found for is elements  located next to the vpma gene family as previously described  <cit>  and was also observed here for the is insertion located at the 3' end of maga <dig> suggesting that further genomic rearrangements have occurred in this area. indeed, this region has been described above as a putative vestige of ice integration. finally, a single transposase gene which product was detected by proteomic analyses  is found in pg <dig> but not in  <dig>  this transposase has some similarities  with an ismmy <dig> transposase of m. mycoides subsp. mycoides sc, but no flanking repeated sequence could be readily identified.

these data indicate that ca. 76% of the additional genomic material of  <dig> is composed of mobile genetic elements when compared to pg <dig>  this represents 10% of the genome, yet these do not lead to major genome rearrangement. overall,  <dig> has  <dig> additional cds,  <dig> of which correspond to cds of ice or transposase. among the remaining,  <dig> relate to the spma family ,  <dig> to hypothetical products  and  <dig> to restriction modification systems  .

protection from dna degradation and invasion
while genetic transformation of strain pg <dig>  <cit>  has become a standard protocol in our laboratory, attempts to transform  <dig> in the same or modified conditions repeatedly failed. as well,  <dig> chromosomal dna is resistant to two type ii restriction enzymes, alw  <dig>  and dpn ii , that are sensitive to dam methylation and restrict dna extracted from pg <dig>  conversely,  <dig> dna is digested by dpn i  which cleaves only when the adenine of its recognition site is methylated . this suggests that the two strains contain a different set of restriction-modification  systems and, indeed,  <dig> contains four additional cds that encode two type ii rm systems, each composed of a putative restriction enzyme and its corresponding methylase. the first one is similar to the bacillus sp. bsp61i rm system while the other resembles that of the sau96i-like found in m. mycoides subps. mycoides sc as mentioned above. indeed, phylogenetic tree reconstructions, although not fully demonstrative, suggested that the bsp61i rm system has most likely been acquired by hgt from firmicutes other than mollicutes while the sau96i-like system has probably been exchanged with members of the "mycoides" cluster. further detailed comparative analyses revealed that  <dig> is better equipped than pg <dig> in terms of rm systems and more specifically in dna methylases. as indicated in table  <dig>   <dig> encodes for  <dig> putative dna methylases of which  <dig> are expressed under laboratory conditions while for pg <dig> this number is only  <dig> with the expression of  <dig> being detected. interestingly, one methylase gene seems to have been duplicated in  <dig>  when compared to pg <dig>  the two paralogs differ from each other and from their pg <dig> ortholog mostly in their central part  which is known to contain the n6_n4_mtase domain . whether this provides the corresponding enzymes with different specificity is not known. both strains display a locus of six genes  with homology to type i rm systems that were designated hsd and are composed of  two hsdm genes coding for two almost identical modification enzymes which would methylate specific adenine residues,  three hsds genes each coding for a distinct rm specificity subunit  that shares homologies with each other  and  one hsdr gene encoding a site-specific endonuclease . interestingly, in pg <dig>  the hsdr gene is disrupted by the insertion of two nucleotides in a polya tract localised in the middle of the gene that results in a premature stop codon. this is in agreement with the detection in  <dig> but not in pg <dig> of peptides specific of the hsdr enzyme. in mycoplasma, such polya tracts have often been involved in high-frequency variation in expression  <cit> . finally, the hsd locus also contains a hypothetical cds whose product is highly similar to a phage family integrase of bifidobacterium longum  <cit>  and motifs found in molecules involved in dna recombination and integration. in m. pulmonis, the hsd locus has been shown to undergo frequent dna rearrangements but the gene encoding the putative recombinase is located elsewhere in the genome  <cit> . if the hsd locus of m. agalactiae is functional then it is worth noting that its hsds sequences diverge between the two strains suggesting that recombinase-mediated dna rearrangements could modulate the specificity of the system. attempts to demonstrate dna rearrangements of the hsd using basic molecular approaches failed. whether this is due to the difficulties in finding specific sequence signatures that would demonstrate recombination is not known.

the flexible gene pool: towards a highly dynamic surface architecture
comparison of the two m. agalactiae genomes further revealed that strains  <dig> and pg <dig> contain  <dig> and  <dig> cds predicted to encode lipoproteins, respectively. proteomic analyses further confirmed the expression of more than 50% of these cds for both strains, with at least  <dig> being expressed in  <dig> and  <dig> in pg <dig>  all but one  being detected in triton x- <dig> . in most cases, these differences are linked to genes present in one strain but not in the other  and to a previously well-characterised gene family, the vpma. this family encodes related, phase-variable, lipoproteins  <cit>  and account for  <dig> cds in  <dig> but only  <dig> in pg <dig>  as previously reported, all vpma genes except two  were shown to be expressed at one point during in vitro propagation of  <dig>  <cit> .

hypothetical related surface lipoproteins are encoded by two other gene families: the so-called drp  and the spma . unlike the vpma, cds encoding products with duf <dig> motifs are scattered on the chromosome, with both strains having a similar size-repertoire composed of  <dig> cds identified as drp  in pg <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig>  one particularity of this family is that it belongs to the gene pool that underwent hgt with members of the "mycoides" cluster. comparison of  <dig> with pg <dig> revealed that they often localized in regions that vary the most between the two strains . except for one , all  <dig> drp loci present a different organization when compared to pg <dig> that reflects the occurrence of complex dna rearrangements , of additional is elements or cds in  <dig> , and/or of pseudogenes in pg <dig> . interestingly, only two drp proteins were detected by proteomic lc-ms/ms. one was expressed in both strains  and is encoded at the same locus  while the other corresponded to mag <dig> in pg <dig> or to maga <dig> in  <dig> that are located at two different loci. interestingly, the homolog maga <dig> occurs as a pseudogene in pg <dig> because of a difference in the length of polya tract that creates by frameshifting a premature stop codon. concerning mag <dig> and its counterpart in  <dig>  maga <dig>  there is no apparent molecular feature that could account for their difference in expression. these two products differ slightly from the rest of the family in that they both lack the sequence needed for prolipoprotein recognition and lipid modification, known as the lipobox and usually located at the c-terminal of their signal peptide.

comparison of the  <dig> and pg <dig> genomes revealed one particular locus composed of several putative cds encoding  a similar n-terminal signal peptide followed by a highly conserved lipobox and  particular amino-acid motifs that are repeated within a particular product. this gene family was further designated as spma for "surface protein of m. agalactiae" and is larger in  <dig> with  <dig> spma genes and only  <dig> in pg <dig>  analyses of the two spma loci indicate that spma genes present in  <dig> but not in pg <dig> have orthologs in the "mycoides" cluster only. more specifically, m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc strain gm <dig>  <cit>  and m. capricolum subsp. capricolum contain  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, that encode putative lipoproteins resembling 5632-spmas and carrying the motif  <dig>  although this question cannot be formally addressed by phylogenetic tree reconstruction, the spma sequence comparison suggests that these genes are part of the gene pool which has been exchanged between m. agalactiae and members of the "mycoides" cluster. the proteomic approach taken in this study failed to detect any of the spma products in one or the other m. agalactiae strains. whether these proteins have been missed by this approach or whether they are not expressed or expressed under different conditions remains to be assessed. a stretch of polyg was found at the 5' untranslated region of each putative spma gene . this last feature is unusual in mycoplasmas that have a low g+c content and is particularly striking in the  <dig> spma locus which displays  <dig> polyg tracts with one containing up to  <dig> g residues. whether these control or affect the transcription of downstream genes is not known but homopolymeric tracts of residues have often been associated with products whose expression is phase variable in mycoplasmas.

interestingly, polyg tracts were found elsewhere in the genome of  <dig>  again at the 5' end of gene encoding putative surface protein. for instance, the conserved hypothetical p48-like product encoded by maga <dig> displays a high similarity with the p <dig> lipoprotein and is detected by ms/ms in the triton detergent phase although its gene does not contain a proper signal peptide followed by a lipobox. careful examination of the 5' end of the p48-like coding sequence revealed a stretch of  <dig> gs and a ribosomal frameshift at this position where the deletion of one g would generate an in-frame signal peptide followed by a lipobox . these data suggested that a mechanism based on polyg  being prone to ribosomal shifting or to mutation could also account in several cases for the difference between the two strains in lipoproteins detected in triton-x <dig> by proteomic analyses .

discussion
whole genome sequencing of m. agalactiae strain  <dig> revealed that it contains an additional  <dig> genes representing an extra- <dig> kbps when compared to the pg <dig> type strain. for organisms that have a small genome size such as mycoplasmas, this is a rather significant feature. the additional material is mostly composed of repeated elements, so that our knowledge of the m. agalactiae pan-genome has been enriched by  <dig> new genes. a large portion of those, more specifically  <dig>  is present in ices or corresponds to is. recent mathematical models by tettelin et al.  <cit>  show that the pan-genome of the mollicute ureaplasma urealyticum is limited, based on the draft sequences of nine strains. this implies that the sequencing of additional strains might not significantly increase our knowledge of this species unless it is targeting a specific biological question  <cit> . although u. urealyticum is a human pathogen and has a genome slightly smaller , the same observation may apply to the m. agalactiae species as indicated by the low number of new genes discovered in our study. thus, sequencing additional m. agalactiae strains might bring little more information on the global coding capacity of this organism.

overall, data obtained here and elsewhere indicate that about 10% of the  <dig> genome is highly dynamic in that large regions corresponding to ice can excise  <cit>  and, theoretically, relocate elsewhere or be transferred to a recipient cell during conjugation, if such event is further shown to occur in this species. the two ice's vestiges, ice iv and v, represent scars of past ice insertions followed by a progressive decay. interestingly, these more resemble the larger ice vestige of pg <dig> or the ice of m. capricolum subsp. capricolum than the three entire ice copies of  <dig> suggesting that this strain may have, at one point, hosted two types of ices. these data indicate that the circulation of ices in some strains might not be such a rare event. the presence of ice circular forms in  <dig>  <cit>  together with the low number of snps detected between the three copies indicate that multiple ice insertions are recent. the mechanisms underlying ice insertion, excision and putative transfer in mycoplasmas have yet to be investigated, but recent studies on ice elements in gram-positive bacteria suggest that these events can be under the control of sophisticated regulation systems in response to changing environmental conditions such as stress or population density  <cit> . the finding of ice in m. agalactiae and members of the "mycoides" cluster together with evidence of hgt in between these species further raised the prospect that these simple bacteria could conjugate. so far, a single report has supported the occurrence of conjugation in mycoplasmas by showing the exchange of genetic material in between m. pulmonis cells via a mechanism resistant to dnase  <cit> . the idea that this phenomenon might be more common among mycoplasmas than first expected is very exciting because, if occurring, it would change the way we see the evolution of these so called "minimal organisms".

although smaller in size than ice, is elements as a whole represent a dynamic potential for the genome because of their copy number. in other bacteria, their contribution to genome plasticity and dynamics is well known  <cit> . here, no major dna inversion or rearrangement was detected between the two m. agalactiae genomes that could be associated to is except for two cases. as previously shown by our group, the first one refers to the duplication in  <dig> of the single vpma cluster of pg <dig> that has been most likely driven by is elements and that resulted in  <dig> having extended possibilities for surface diversification when compared to pg <dig>  <cit> . the second case refers to a region which organization significantly differs in between pg <dig> and  <dig>  and which contains several is related elements . events underlying rearrangements in this region cannot be exactly retraced but most likely they are ancient and have resulted in duplication of the ptsg gene in pg <dig> . interestingly, this region, like many others associated with is, contains several genes or pseudogenes that have undergone hgt suggesting that is may directly contribute to this phenomenon as suggested for other bacteria  <cit> . finally, we showed that is insertions may have an impact on gene expression, thus modifying some of the strain properties such as those associated with restriction-modification in  <dig> 

compared to the pg <dig> type strain,  <dig> seems better equipped for dna exchange. besides harbouring an impressive "mobilome", some of which may be tailored for conjugative transfer, it contains a number of operating rm systems. on one hand, these may act as a barrier to dna invasion  <cit>  and explain why  <dig> dna is resistant to several methylase-sensitive restriction enzymes and to dna transformation . on the other hand, while methylated dna is protected against degradation, it might be more likely accepted by a recipient cell displaying similar rm systems, regardless of the dna transfer or uptake mechanisms. indeed, some of the  <dig> specific rm systems not present in pg <dig> have homologs in members of the "mycoides" cluster . whether the structure of the m. agalactiae population is made of a majority of pg2-like strains that are deficient in mobile elements as well as in rm systems with only some strains such as  <dig> being more prone to gene exchange with selected partners, is not yet known. finally, dna methylases, whether they belong or not to rm systems, could play a number of functions related to fitness or virulence, including the regulation of various physiological processes such as chromosome replication, mismatch repair, transposition, and transcription as described in other bacteria  <cit> . they may also be involved in the epigenetic switch of some key factors such as in the pap of the uropathogenic e. coli  <cit> .

interestingly, a fairly good portion of the flexible gene pool of m. agalactiae is dedicated to producing surface proteins, many of which are lipoproteins. based on in silico analysis,  <dig> contains ca.  <dig> lipoproteins with at least  <dig> expressed under laboratory conditions. these include the vpma family composed of  <dig> different lipoproteins that are encoded by  <dig> genes in  <dig> and  <dig> in pg <dig> and that are phase variable in expression and probably in size  <cit> . phase variation of surface molecules is a common mechanism in mycoplasma species  <cit>  and is probably a major adaptive strategy for these minimal pathogens. vpma phase variants are produced at high frequencies and in a reversible manner by site-specific recombination  <cit>  but comparative proteogenomics conducted here suggest that other variable systems may co-exist. for instance, expression of the p48-like protein as a lipoprotein that is soluble in triton-x <dig> may depend on a riboshifting mechanism or on reversible hypermutation in a polyg tract localised at the 5' coding sequence . indeed, data obtained by lynyansky et al.  <cit>  showed that translation of a full length p <dig> lipoprotein in m. bovis is associated with the length of a similar polyg tract. the length of this homopolymer varies from  <dig> to  <dig> residues when comparing four m. bovis strains, with nine g allowing translation of a complete p <dig>  indeed, expression of the two homologs, the m. agalactiae p48-like and the m. bovis p <dig>  is most likely phase variable in the two ruminant pathogens. several other polyg tracts, some containing up to  <dig> residues, were found in the study that are associated with the 5' end of genes encoding surface lipoproteins suggesting that this may be a common slippage mechanism in m. agalactiae. finally, the drp family involves genes that circulate by hgt between m. agalactiae and members of the "mycoides" cluster. based on comparative proteogenomics,  <dig> and pg <dig> have a same size repertoire each composed of a different set with only  <dig> out of  <dig> or  <dig> drp products being expressed, one common to the two strains and one specific. whether this reflects a mechanism of phase variation is unlikely, but silent drp genes may act as a sequence reservoir for the emergence of new drp expression patterns. taken together these results suggest that the two m. agalactiae strains might display very different surface architectures with highly dynamic compositions during clonal propagation.

the strain  <dig> was initially chosen because of its particular genetic features, several of which were found in its close relative m. bovis. this was further confirmed in this study which shows that  <dig>  unlike pg <dig>  possesses  mobile elements such ice and is in multiple copies,  a p48-like gene that is expressed, and  two genes related to phage immunity that are also present in m. bovis pg <dig>  <cit> . the ovine/caprine pathogen m. agalactiae and the cattle pathogen m. bovis were first classified as the same species and our findings indicate that a continuum of strains might exist in between these two species. the genome sequence of m. bovis has been achieved  and its analysis may unravel even more common traits as well as some specificities that may explain their respective host-specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
multiple genome sequencing of closely related bacterial species can address various significant issues which range from a better understanding of forces driving microbial evolution to the design of novel vaccines.

recent pan-genome studies using genome  <cit>  or gene centred  <cit>  approaches, strongly suggest that microbial genomes are continuously sampling and/or shuffling their genetic information rather than undergoing slow, progressive changes. by introducing the means for variability in the population, this dynamic process increases the chances for rapid adaptation and survival to changing environments.

mycoplasma species have limited coding capacity yet our comparative study shows that two strains of the same species may display significant differences in the size of their mobile gene set, which one is marginal in the type strain but may represent up to 13% of a field strain. as observed for e. coli, these genes that relate to is, phages or plasmids, are often associated with an accessory gene pool, usually represented by orfans or genes present only in limited number of genomes across bacteria. for minimal genomes, this mobile gene set may provide a vehicle for the accessory as well as for the character genes to disseminate throughout population. moreover, large mobile elements such as ice may expand the genomic space, facilitating the emergence of new genes. this dynamic genome scheme may be crucial for mycoplasmas to counterbalance their reductive evolution so far marked by genome downsizing.

ultra-high throughput genome sequencing is becoming more and more accessible so that wide and affordable studies will soon expand our knowledge of the mycoplasma pan-genome. because several mycoplasma species are of importance for the medical and veterinary fields as well as excellent models for studying the minimal cell concept, this research area will undoubtly have a beneficial impact for both applied and theoretical mycoplasmology as well as for general microbiology.
