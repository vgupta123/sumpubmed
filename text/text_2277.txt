BACKGROUND
brucellosis has not been reported in domestic pigs in belgium since  <dig>  <cit> , but in  <dig>  brucella suis biovar  <dig> strains were isolated from hunter-killed boar  <cit> , demonstrating the circulation of the bacteria amongst wild boar  populations in belgium. since then, b. suis biovar  <dig> has been isolated from wild boar in many countries of central and western europe such as france  <cit> , switzerland  <cit> , germany  <cit> , spain  <cit> , and croatia  <cit> .

in belgium as in other european countries, a steady increase of wild boar populations has been observed over the last twenty years. from  <dig> to  <dig>  according to the official census of the department of nature and forestry, the estimated hunting bags of wild boar in southern belgium  increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the overabundance of wildlife, recognized as a relevant risk factor for disease transmission between wildlife and domestic animals  <cit> , compromises the health surveillance programs carried out in livestock.

in the domestic pig, brucellosis manifests as infertility and abortions in sows and orchitis in males. extragenital lesions such as lymphadenitis, subcutaneous abscesses, arthritis, and spondylitis are also common  <cit> . in wild boar, b. suis biovar  <dig> is often isolated in the absence of gross lesions  <cit> . recently, several outbreaks of brucellosis affecting outdoor herds of domestic pigs occurred in germany and france  <cit> , and wild boar appeared as the source of infection. in france, the birth of pig/wild boar hybrids confirmed the intrusion of boar, attracted by sows in heat.

besides b. suis biovar  <dig>  brucellosis in suidae is caused also by b. suis biovars  <dig> and  <dig>  the first is present mainly in north and south america, asia, and oceania, while the second is reported in china, the united states, and recently, europe  <cit> .

unlike b. suis biovars  <dig> and  <dig>  biovar  <dig> is only weakly zoonotic  <cit> . few cases of human brucellosis with isolation of b. suis biovar  <dig> have been reported so far, and they concerned immunocompromised people. in france, for instance, the bacterium was isolated from a hemoculture obtained from a hunter suffering from diabetes and silicosis  <cit> . yet the recent isolation of b. suis biovar  <dig> from pigs, wild boar, and horses in a confined region of croatia shows the emergence of zoonotic biovars in europe  <cit> . translocation of wild boar for breeding or hunting purposes increases the risk of spreading of zoonotic brucellosis throughout europe.

the aims of this study were to determine the apparent seroprevalence of brucellosis in wild boar sampled in the four main hunting regions of belgium and to identify potential risk factors associated with seropositivity. direct and indirect brucellosis tests were also compared to determine the most suitable combination of diagnostic tools for conducting a successful prevalence study in wildlife.

se r: relative sensitivity; sp r: relative specificity. 95% ci are specified.

in the cft,  <dig> % of the samples yielded uninterpretable result, because of either hemolysis or anticomplementary activity. the percentage of unusable samples in the rbt reached  <dig> % . only 1% of the sera could not be tested by sat.

of the samples giving a negative result in the ielisa ,  <dig> showed a positive result in one of the other three tests. two samples showed positivity in the cft, but the level of positivity was low . in the rbt,  <dig> samples gave positive results, with  <dig> showing a weak reaction  and  <dig> a strong reaction . in the sat,  <dig> sera reacted positively, with a titer superior to  <dig> i.u./ml.

a significant difference exists between the apparent seroprevalence from  <dig>   <cit>  and the apparent overall one found in this study . the apparent seroprevalences for each age and sex class are presented in table <dig>  the apparent seroprevalences by year of sampling, along with the annual hunting bag, are presented in figure <dig>

the multivariate logistic regression model performed on ielisa results  showed year of sampling and age were significantly associated with boar seropositivity. these effects were both significant according to the wald chi-square hypothesis tests .

overall data of the model: - <dig> log likelihood =  <dig> , likelihood ratio chi-square =  <dig>  , p <  <dig> .

in contrast, sex was not a significant influencing factor . the apparent seroprevalence was affected neither by month of sampling  nor by region of sampling .

all the investigated hunting estates harbored seropositive boar.

culture and polymerase chain reaction 
spleens and tonsils were tested by culture  and pcr . in a first step, organs were randomly selected from seropositive  boar. organs from seronegative animals were analyzed in a second step.

for the seropositive animals, results differed according to the test used and the organ targeted. none of the seronegative boar tested positive by culture or pcr. the results are presented in table <dig> 

np: number of positive animals, nt: number of tested animals.

in order to compare culture and pcr thoroughly, table <dig>  presents the tonsils  and spleens  on which culture and pcr were performed in parallel. all but one of the tonsils testing positive by culture also tested positive by pcr, and pcr identified as positive  <dig> tonsils that were negative by culture. only  <dig> out of  <dig> spleens testing positive by culture were detected by pcr, and  <dig> spleens testing negative by culture tested positive by pcr.

wild boar testing positive by both ielisa and pcr  showed various serological profiles :  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  tested positive by cft, rbt, and sat respectively.

np: number of positive animals, nt: number of tested animals.

all isolates  were confirmed as b. suis biovar  <dig> according to routine typing methods. no yersinia sp. was isolated from tonsils  by culture.

discussion
over this five-year investigation,  <dig> wild boar were tested. the results show that brucellosis is endemic in wild boar in southern belgium. by comparison with a previous study carried out in the same region with the same ielisa  <cit> , an upward tendency was observed in the present work. as expected, the four serological tests showed different results, the highest apparent seroprevalence being observed with the ielisa . these differences are due not only to the intrinsic factors of each test but also to the immunoglobulin classes that the tests target  <cit> . the ielisa detects igg <dig> and igg <dig> . these immunoglobulins are present in the later stage of infection and persist over a long period of time  <cit> . the cft and rbt mainly detect igg <dig>  and the principle of sat is to detect anti-agglutinin antibodies mainly of the igm isotype, markers of acute infection. in this study, the large proportion of wild boar showing positive results in the ielisa and a lower seroprevalence in the sat suggests that brucellosis is chronic in wild boar populations in the investigated area. godfroid and coworkers report the same trends, with apparent seroprevalences of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  measured by ielisa and sat respectively  <cit> . although the relative sensitivities of the cft, rbt, and sat are low compared to that of the ielisa, their relative specificities are above 90%. a few elisa-negative samples were positive by cft or rbt, but positive reactions were weak in these tests. on the other hand, both elisa-negative, sat-positive samples showed a high titer in the sat test. these boar might have been sampled at an early stage of the humoral response, before the appearance of iggs. the lesser sensitivities of the cft, rbt, and sat are confirmed by the serological profiles of the pcr/elisa-positive boar.

the apparent seroprevalences reported in the present study are higher than those mentioned in other european reports. results obtained with an ielisa were around 35% in the canton of jura, switzerland  <cit> , 22% in northeastern germany  <cit> , and ranged from 25% to 46% in different regions of spain  <cit> . in france, the apparent seroprevalence varied from 20% to 35% according to the department  <cit> , but these results were based on cft and rbt used in serial or parallel testing. serological results should be compared with caution because of the different tests used.

the circulation of pathogens within wild populations may be influenced by artificial management, and notably by fencing, translocations, and feeding. the impact of these factors is not fully understood, however. in one study, several pathogens including brucella showed higher prevalences in fenced estates than in open ones  <cit> , but other surveys conducted in spain  <cit>  and france  <cit>  showed no relationship between the apparent prevalence of brucellosis and wild boar management or density.

in southern belgium, it is forbidden to fence hunting estates, but artificial feeding has been practiced in recent years as supplementation during the winter, as a dissuasive measure aiming to reduce crop damage by wild boar or as attractive measure during hunting season. clearly, artificial feeding causes spatial aggregation of wild boar and thus, presumably, increased contacts among animals. this factor, associated with the steady increase in wild boar populations, could be linked to the rise in seroprevalence detected between  <dig> and  <dig> in belgium.

our study, however, shows no significant differences in prevalence between regions, even though inter-regional disparities in wild boar densities are observed. according to the official  <dig> census of wild boar populations  <cit> , the famenne region has the highest density:  <dig> individuals per 1000 ha, versus  <dig> per 1000 ha in the condroz. these official data are means for defined regions, and do not take local aggregation into account. the  <dig> hunting zones investigated in this study were all characterized by high wild boar density, as evidenced by annual hunting bags.

in the famenne and ardenne regions, where high wild boar densities overlap with outdoor pig farming, there is an increased risk of disease transmission between wild and domestic suids. a similar situation is reported in switzerland  <cit> . preventive actions should concern both farmers and hunters. outdoor pig farming requires setting up double fences and maintaining sows indoors during heat. on the other hand, hunting stakeholders must control translocations and the release of farm-bred « wild boar », which is strictly prohibited. likewise, surveillance strategies for brucellosis must include both pigs  and wild boar. in the latter, surveillance is all the more important because brucella infection is silent in most cases. as observed previously  <cit> , the seroprevalence increases with age and does not differ between females and males.

the seroprevalence was significantly higher in  <dig> than in previous years of sampling. the reason for this increase is unknown, but as mentioned above, it could be related to the steady rise in wild boar numbers. further studies will confirm or not an upward trend.

brucella infections can be diagnosed unequivocally only by isolating and identifying brucella spp. or detecting the bacterial dna by pcr  <cit> . the pcr used in this study is known to be highly specific for brucella spp.  <cit> . isolating the bacteria by culture appears less sensitive than the pcr, since only  <dig> out of  <dig> pcr-positive samples yielded a positive culture, whatever the organ. a lower sensitivity of the culture method has been reported in other studies  <cit>  and is partly related to wildlife sampling conditions, which do not always guarantee good quality of the sampling, adequate transport, and proper tissue conservation. this suggests that a pcr approach, considered more robust under field conditions, should be preferred in large-scale and long-term wildlife surveys. accordingly, a field study performed in switzerland and using is <dig> real-time pcr gave excellent results for detection of brucella spp. infections in wild boar  <cit> .

whatever the method used in our study, brucella or its dna was more frequently detected in tonsils than in spleen. the recorded bacteriological prevalences were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for tonsils versus  <dig> % and  <dig> % for spleen. this could mean that in splenic tissue the concentration of brucella dna is lower, and often below the detection limit of the test. real-time pcr assays, having higher sensitivity  <cit> , could increase detection of the bacteria within the selected organs. another cause of false-negative pcr results might be the presence in the spleen of polymerase inhibitors such as blood constituents  <cit> . variability in the location and quantity of brucella bacteria among targeted organs has been documented  <cit>  and is likely to correlate with the stage of infection in individual animals.

between the ielisa and pcr results, discrepancies were observed. the high number of ielisa-positive samples that were pcr-negative is worth stressing. this might reflect a lack of sensitivity of the pcr method, a lack of specificity of the ielisa, or both, to some extent. no “gold-standard” test is available for determining the true serological prevalence towards brucella spp.  <cit> . the high-sensitive ielisa was used in first step for optimizing the detection of carriers at the expense of specificity. thus the overall prevalence could be overestimated. nevertheless the ielisa detected all the pcr-positive boar, unlike the three other tests. cross-reactions seen with other bacteria are a well-known problem in serological diagnosis of brucellosis  <cit> . because of a shared o-chain on the lipopolysaccharides , humoral responses induced by some bacteria and notably y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  are indistinguishable in ielisas from those induced by smooth brucella species. in the present study, although no yersinia sp. was isolated from tonsils, the real impact of y <dig> on our serological results remains unknown. y <dig> has been found in  <dig> % of examined wild boar in switzerland  <cit> . alternatively, the discrepancy between the number of seropositive animals and the number of pcr-positive animals might be due, in part, to past infections, with clearance of the bacteria from the host and persistence of anti-brucella antibodies. this “self-limiting” process has been observed in cattle experimentally infected with b. abortus biovar  <dig> or b. suis biovar  <dig>  <cit> .

all wild boar samples  isolated in the present study were identified as b. suis biovar  <dig>  these results are in agreement with previous studies carried out on wild boar and hares in europe  <cit> . yet the isolation of b. suis biovar  <dig> from pigs, wild boar, and horses in croatia shows the emergence of zoonotic biovars in europe  <cit> . translocation of wild boar for breeding or hunting purposes increases the risk of spreading zoonotic brucellosis among neighboring countries. in this context it remains important to biotype brucella strains isolated from wildlife in surveillance programs throughout europe.

CONCLUSIONS
our study suggests that brucellosis is widespread among wild boar in southern belgium. both wild suid populations and brucellosis prevalences have increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  and this constitutes a growing risk of spillback to outdoor-farmed pig herds. for financial and practical reasons, serological tests are the first tools for use in brucellosis prevalence studies in wildlife, but they must be interpreted with caution and the elisas used must be expressly validated for use on wild species. furthermore, it is strongly recommended to associate them with tools for direct diagnosis. in the present study, pcr proved more sensitive than culture under wildlife sampling conditions. spleen and tonsils are lymphoid tissues usually sampled in multi-disease monitoring programs. they remain top-grade organs for direct diagnosis of brucellosis, with a preference for tonsils.
