BACKGROUND
abundant examples of similar segments appearing in different protein folds, here continuous structural fragments in native protein folds, have been reported. although some of those segments are believed to have originated from common ancestors, evolutionary scenarios for many of those segments are not clear. as opposed to the monophyletic scenario of presently existing protein domains, lupas et al. argued the hypothesis of ancient short peptide ancestors  <cit> . they found local sequence and structure similarities such as p-loops, zinc finger motifs, and asp boxes, in different protein folds based on results of all-against-all structural comparisons of segments using their rigorous structure comparison method. the reason they employed their structure comparison method is that occurrences of such segments 'might not be expected to be meaningful from a sequence-only perspective  <cit> '.

originally, the profile method was developed by gribskov et al.  <cit> . since that time, sequence profiles calculated from multiple alignments of protein families have been used for finding distantly related protein sequences. here, a profile is a table that lists amino acid preferences in each position of a given multiple sequence alignment. results show that the inclusion of evolutionary information for both the query protein and for proteins in the database being searched improved the detection of related proteins  <cit> . these profile-profile comparison methods, which are sequence-based methods, are fundamentally superior to the profile method both in their ability to identify related proteins and to improve alignment accuracy  <cit> . then, friedberg and godzik  constructed a segment dataset, called fragnostic, by combining the scores of their profile-profile comparison method, ffas <dig>  <cit> , and the cα root mean square deviation  of the structural alignment. they presented an alternative view of the protein structure universe in terms of the relations between interfold similarity and functional similarity of proteins via segments  <cit> . they found functional commonalities of proteins with different folds that share the similar segments, such as dimetal binding loops. therefore, the segments are shared by many different protein folds.

profile-profile comparison methods have been developed and used for various purposes other than the original one. for instance, profile-profile comparison methods were applied in an attempt to establish evolutionary relations within protein superfolds  <cit> . in this attempt, among three small β-barrel folds, intra-fold similarity scores calculated using profile-profile comparisons were used to identify functionally distinct sub-families. an amino acid sequence-order-independent profile-profile comparison method  has been proposed and used for functional site comparison to find distant evolutionary relations by integrating local structural information  <cit> . some novel evolutionary relations across folds were detected automatically using soippa. recently, remmert et al. proposed the possibility of divergent evolution of outer membrane β proteins from an ancestral ββ hairpin using their hmm-hmm comparison method  <cit> . using two atypical proteins as analogous reference structures, they argued that similarities of outer membrane β proteins are unlikely to be the result of sequence convergence.

however, no application of profile-profile comparison methods combines sequence-based profiles and structure-based profiles to capture more precise sequence-structure relations. amino acid sequence patterns in proteins can be represented as profiles constructed using sequence and/or structural information. on one hand, comparison of sequence-based profiles based on evolutionary information is known to be highly effective for protein fold recognition  <cit> , even when they are constructed without including explicit structural information, which indicates that they might harbor structural information. on the other hand, some amino acid substitution patterns, which reflect the physicochemical constraints of local conformations, are well known to correlate strongly with the protein structure at the local level. profiles or position-specific amino acid propensities based on local structural classification have been used to study local sequence-structure relations for many years  <cit> . moreover, libraries of sequence patterns that correlate well with local structural elements have been constructed  <cit> . amino acid propensities were analyzed at each position of short protein segments within a structural cluster obtained by structural classification methods  <cit> . position-specific amino acid propensities in protein segments with two consecutive secondary structure elements have also been investigated to support protein structure prediction  <cit> . pei and grishin effectively combined evolutionary and structural information to improve local structure predictions  <cit> .

consequently, the aim of this study is to identify properties that are common to both profile types, and to find novel sequence-structure relations. to this end, we developed a method we call "cross profile analysis" to compare structure-based profiles originating from the results of local structural classifications, with sequence-based profiles produced by psi-blast using forte, our profile-profile comparison method  <cit> . using structure-based profiles derived from clusters of segment structures with 9-residue and 15-residue lengths as a starting point, we identified several structure-based profiles that correlate well with sequence-based profiles. these correlations indicate structural similarity between conformations of a segment cluster and the local structures corresponding to the segments of a protein family whose sequence-based profile exhibited strong correlation with a structure-based profile. this report describes previously undetectable sequence-structure patterns that transcend protein superfamily and fold boundaries, especially for segments that contain β-hairpin-like structures, shared by proteins with two distinct folds. furthermore, through experimental measurements, we demonstrate that a deduced peptide corresponding to the segments, which has been shown to exhibit such sequence-structure correlation, is structurally stable in aqueous solution, suggesting the existence of ancient short peptide ancestors. we discuss the possibility of the convergent evolution of the protein short segments with patterns detected using our cross profile analysis.

RESULTS
cross profile analysis
using forte, we compared the profiles of two different profile types:  a sequence-based profile stored in the forte library and produced by psi-blast containing evolutionary information, and  a structure-based profile . structure-based profiles derived from local structural classification are expected to represent the protein structural information  <cit> . forte enables us to compare different profile types directly because it employs the correlation coefficient as a measure of similarity between two profile columns that are to be compared. we used structure-based profiles derived from clusters of segments as queries to find strong correlations with  <dig>  sequence-based profiles in the forte library. two examples of z-score distributions of clusters for both 9-residue and 15-residue-long segments are shown in figure  <dig> 

we have analyzed structural clusters with at least  <dig> members to ensure that biases resulting from imperfect samples are avoided. of  <dig>  clusters for 9-residue-long segments,  <dig> had  <dig> members or more. out of  <dig>  clusters for 15-residue-long segments,  <dig> had  <dig> members or more. of the  <dig> clusters for 9-residue-long segments,  <dig> clusters with z-score of  =  <dig> or higher were identified , i.e., the  <dig> structure-based profiles of clusters showed significant correlation with  <dig> sequence-based profiles in the forte library for 9-residue-long segments. the threshold of the z-score was determined empirically  <cit> . conformations of medoid segments of the  <dig> clusters are presented in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  of the  <dig> clusters,  <dig> clusters with z =  <dig> or higher were identified for the 15-residue-long segments , i.e., the  <dig> structure-based profiles of clusters showed significant correlation with  <dig> sequence-based profiles. conformations of medoid segments of the  <dig> clusters are shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  as shown in both figures, the  <dig> clusters exhibit various conformations. some are compact, although others are extended. these conformations consist of several secondary structure elements such as helices, strands, turns, and bulges. neither a simple helix nor a simple strand exists. as might be expected, several similarities were observed among those profiles. for instance, the profile of cluster # <dig> in table  <dig> was apparently similar to the parts of the profiles of clusters # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> in table  <dig> because many members are common to those five clusters, i.e., many members of cluster # <dig> for 9-residue-long segments correspond to the parts of segments in clusters # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> for 15-residue-long segments, and many segments in cluster # <dig> were derived from adjacent positions of the segments in the cluster # <dig> . details of clusters # <dig> and # <dig> are discussed below  1jnra:614- <dig> and 1ktha:16-31).

on average, cα rmsds between the medoid segments of structural clusters and the segments of hits  in the forte library were, respectively,  <dig> +/- <dig>  Å for 9-residue-long segments, and  <dig> +/- <dig> Å for 15-residue-long segments. although some exceptions with large rmsds that might be false positives exist, these results are separate from the results of random match of 9-residue and 15-residue-long segments reported by du et al.  <cit> . they calculated rmsds between randomly chosen fragments and reported their distribution. they found that the centers of distributions for 9-residue and 15-residue-long segments were located, respectively, at  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å. their definitions of segments with respect to the amount of secondary structures are matched with conformations of these segments . these results clearly indicate the structural similarity between conformations of a segment cluster and the local structure of a protein family. generally, significant correlation between profiles of two different types indicates not only the similarities of amino acid substitution patterns but also those of the structural similarities of constituent segments of both sequence-based and structure-based profiles.

the  <dig> profiles derived from the structural clusters for 9-residue-long segments showed correlation with sequence profiles in seven different protein folds according to the scop classification. half of them showed correlation with  <dig> sequence profiles of segments in proteins that possess an α-α superhelix fold . in table  <dig> the profile of cluster # <dig> was apparently similar to the profiles of clusters # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig>  these were the 'adjacent-segment' effects described above. similarly, the profile of cluster # <dig> was similar to that of cluster # <dig> in table  <dig> . the profile derived from cluster # <dig> showed strong correlation with  <dig> sequence profiles of segments corresponding to ca2+-coordinating loops in proteins of the ef-hand superfamily . the  <dig> clusters of 15-residue-long segments show correlation with a more diverse set of proteins  than was the case for the clusters of 9-residue-long segments, i.e., correlation observed in  <dig> different protein folds. however, most of the correlations above the threshold were observed between the sequence profiles of segments of the ef-hand superfamily and the profiles derived from cluster # <dig>  which clearly reflects the functional constraints on protein sequence evolution. apparently, the profile of cluster # <dig> in table  <dig> corresponds to part of the profile of clusters # <dig> in table  <dig> 

in principle, methods used for the structural classification of the protein segments are expected to affect structure-based profiles. however, a small change of parameters such as a threshold variable for structural similarity dth used for clustering has been demonstrated not to have much effect on the results in our previous study  <cit> . we observed robustness of the shapes of the distribution of segment clusters. for instance, we showed the dependence of a threshold parameter on the clustering results is minimum around dth = 30°, which we used for this study, to 40° .

preserved sequence-structure patterns
in the cross profile analysis of the 15-residue-long segments, we identified preserved sequence-structure patterns that transcend protein superfamily or fold boundaries that were previously undetectable .

 1p1la:2- <dig>  1kr4a:7- <dig>  and 1mwqa:58-72
the structure-based profile of cluster # <dig> of 15-residue-long segments showed significant correlation  with the three sequence profiles of 1p1la:2- <dig> , 1kr4a:7- <dig> , and 1mwqa:58- <dig> . according to the scop classification, these three proteins belong to the ferredoxin-like fold  category. two of them, 1p1la and 1kr4a are members of the same cuta <dig> family in the glnb-like superfamily, whereas 1mwqa belongs to the ycii-like family in the dimeric α+β barrel superfamily. in the cath database, the three proteins possess the same α-β plaits topology ; 1p1la and 1kr4a are classified as having cath id:  <dig> . <dig>  topology, and 1mwqa is classified as a dimeric α+β plaits protein . the ferredoxin-like fold, one of the scop superfolds, consists of two repetitive βαβ units. it is particularly interesting that the sequence profiles of the structurally corresponding regions, the n-terminal half of the first βαβ unit in 1p1la and 1kr4a, and the n-terminal half of the second βαβ unit in 1mwqa, showed significant correlation with the same profile cluster # <dig>  in spite of the differences in their sequential positions . this result might indicate that structure actually shapes sequence evolution or it might result from context -dependent substitutions of amino acids. alternatively, the correlation might be a relic of the duplication of a βαβ unit in the evolution of proteins with the ferredoxin-like fold  <cit> .

 1jnra:614- <dig> and 1ktha:16-31
we were unable to recognize the evolutionary relations between the two proteins, chain a of 1jnr and chain a of 1kth. however, two segments of 1jnra:614- <dig>  and 1ktha:16- <dig>  form similar conformations  in two unrelated proteins with different folds ; 1jnra is the α-subunit of adenylylsulfate reductase that reversibly catalyzes the reduction of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to sulfite and amp  <cit> , and 1ktha is a protease inhibitor that corresponds to the c-terminal kunitz-type domain from the α <dig> chain of human type vi collagen  <cit> . based on scop  <dig>  release  <cit> , the flvc-segment is embedded in domain  <dig> , which is in the spectrin repeat-like fold class . the bpti-segment is categorized in the bpti-like fold class . domains that contain the spectrin repeat-like fold usually comprise three α-helices  <cit> . however, the entire fold of 1jnra is classified as the disulfide-rich α+β fold. in addition, according to the cath classification  <cit> , most of the 1jnra fold is in the domain that possesses the fad/nad-binding domain topology . 1ktha is categorized into the factor xa inhibitor topology .

in both 1jnra and 1ktha, the sequence profiles of two consecutive 15-residue length segments show significant correlation  with structure-based profiles of two clusters . the n-terminal regions of 1jnra:614- <dig> and 1ktha:16- <dig> showed correlation with cluster # <dig>  whereas the c-terminal regions, 1jnra:615- <dig> and 1ktha:17- <dig> showed correlation with cluster # <dig>  the structure-based profiles reflect the results from the structural classifications of the protein segments. therefore, we investigated the composition of the two clusters # <dig> and # <dig> to check whether segments similar to those of 1jnra and 1ktha are included in them. most of the segments in the two clusters mutually overlap. as expected,  <dig> out of the  <dig> segments in cluster # <dig> and  <dig> segments in cluster # <dig> are derived from adjacent positions in the same proteins. the clusters contain segments that mainly originate from all-β  and α+β proteins . however, it is unlikely that this suggests bias in the usage of the folds because the segments are derived from  <dig> folds  and  <dig> folds . although the two proteins, 1g6x and 2knt, from the bpti-like fold class  are included in the clusters, no protein of the spectrin repeat-like fold class  is incorporated. consequently, at least for 1jnra, no readily apparent evolutionary relation exists to explain the remarkable correlation between sequence-based and structure-based profiles. the segments of the two structural clusters are included in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

similar patterns of sequence conservation between the sequence profiles of the flvc-segment and the structure-based profiles of clusters # <dig> and # <dig> are readily identifiable. figure  <dig> shows the sequence conservation patterns of the corresponding regions of 1jnra:614- <dig>  and of 1ktha:16- <dig> , and the corresponding regions of clusters # <dig> and # <dig>  although we observed family-specific residue conservation in each sequence profile, we also found that the tyr and asp residues at the eighth and ninth positions of the regions corresponding to the flvc-segment and bpti-segment were conserved. this corresponds to the structural clusters in which the eighth and ninth positions of cluster # <dig> and the seventh and eighth positions of cluster # <dig> are conserved. furthermore, the conserved gly residue at the 13th position of the regions corresponding to the flvc-segment and bpti-segment is also conserved at the 13th position in cluster # <dig> and at the 12th position of cluster # <dig>  these conserved residues are located close to the turn region of β-hairpin-like structures. the conservation patterns of residues near the turn region of the segments discussed above resemble chignolin, the short peptide which spontaneously folds in water  <cit> .

our classification results obtained using the scop  <dig>  release  show that there are  <dig> superfamilies with the spectrin repeat-like fold among the clusters. of those, domain  <dig> of 1jnra:503- <dig> contains the 1jnra:614- <dig> segment belonging to the succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase flavoprotein c-terminal domain superfamily. of the  <dig> superfamilies, only three, succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase flavoprotein c-terminal domain, ribosomal protein s <dig>  and phou-like superfamilies, have an 'additional' β-sheet at the c-terminus portions. compared to the β-sheet of 1jnr, the region corresponding to both the β-sheet at the c-terminus portion of ribosomal protein s <dig> and the phou-like superfamily is small. moreover, according to scop, the region is assigned to other domains that belong to other folds, instead of to the spectrin repeat-like fold, as is true when other classification databases such as cath and vast  <cit>  are used. according to the classification of both the cath and scop database, the bpti-like fold  consists of a single superfamily.

sequence evolution of the segments in each family
we measured the 'direction' of the amino acid sequence evolution of the segments, including the flvc-segment and bpti-segment, as described above, in terms of the compatibility with the structure-based profiles. this compatibility might reflect the physicochemical constraints or preferences of segment conformations in clusters # <dig> and # <dig>  we calculated the score s for a sequence in the structure-based profiles of clusters # <dig> and # <dig>  in methods), and postulated that high scores indicate high compatibility of the sequence with the profile. we compared the scores between existing and deduced ancestral sequences, and considered that differences in the scores Δs  in methods) reflect the direction of sequence evolution. here, the results suggest that negative Δs means that existing sequences are less compatible with the structure-based profile than their ancestral sequences in terms of β-hairpin-like structure that we identified.

we identified the commonalities and differences between the two protein families. the range of score distributions of existing sequences , except for those with gaps based on the pfam alignments, was almost always the same. in contrast, the deduced ancestral sequences of the two families have different scores. the scores for the ancestral sequence of the pfam protein family id: pf <dig> are, respectively,  <dig>  for the profile of cluster # <dig>  and  <dig>  for the profile of cluster # <dig>  meanwhile, the scores of ancestral sequence of the pf <dig> family are  <dig>  for cluster # <dig>  and  <dig>  for cluster # <dig>  therefore, the score differences Δs between the ancestral and existing sequences of the two protein families show different distributions . substantial portions of Δs are distributed from around  <dig> to - <dig> in both families. however, some existing proteins of pf <dig> give positive values for Δs, although all except one of the existing sequences of pf <dig> give negative values for Δs. this result suggests that the sequences of several subfamilies, including 1jnra of pf <dig>  have evolved towards increased compatibility with the structure-based profiles , which seems to indicate that a convergent evolution might have occurred at the corresponding region of 1jnra and its subfamily.

the results might be explainable using either of two evolutionary scenarios: divergent or convergent evolution. however, for the following reasons, we speculate that those segments originated from distinct ancestors in this case. first, we found similarities between the structure-based profiles and the sequence profiles of two distinct protein families rather than direct similarities between segments of two distinct families. consequently, it is difficult to hypothesize that those segments originated from a common ancestor through an evolutionary mechanism that necessarily occurred before the divergence into two distinct families. although sequences of the pfam protein family id: pf <dig> are distributed mainly in bacteria, most sequences in the pfam protein family id: pf <dig> are distributed in eukaryotes. in addition, the functions and localization of two protein families are completely different. protein sequences of pf <dig> are parts of reductases, dehydrogenases, and oxidases in a cell. in contrast, proteins of pf <dig> are secreted proteins which function as protease inhibitors or toxins. furthermore, for example, in humans, 1ktha  is encoded in an exon, i.e. no exon boundaries exist in its portion. there are no introns in the gene that encodes 1jnra , which is a portion of a large archaeal protein. finally, it is difficult to imagine that present proteins of pf <dig> were derived originally from both the turn region of β-hairpin-like structures and the rest because these proteins are too small to be stable and functional without this region. taken together, the similarity between segments presented here does not necessarily indicate common evolutionary ancestry. it is apparently a reflection of physicochemical constraints of local conformations, i.e., it seems probable that convergent evolution might have occurred for this case. the evolutionary directions analyzed in figure  <dig> also support the scenario of convergent evolution.

implications for short autonomous elements
we have identified several structural clusters with structure-based profiles that show remarkably strong correlation with sequence-based profiles. we have observed that most segments are structurally similar, and are similar also to other segments in the cluster. for example, 15-residue-long segments of 1jnra:615- <dig> in the flvc-segment and 1ktha:17- <dig> in the bpti-segment are similar to one another. the two segments are also similar to segments in cluster # <dig>  whose profile indicates significant correlation with their sequence-based profiles. do segments fold into particular structures irrespective of their context? to ascertain this, we synthesized 15-residue peptides with the deduced sequence of cluster # <dig> , which has the highest score, i.e. the most compatible sequence with the structure-based profile of cluster # <dig>  and conducted several experiments to elucidate its 3d-structure in aqueous solution.

conformational analysis of the synthetic peptide by circular dichroism  spectroscopy revealed that the peptide had an autonomous element that exhibited high foldability and stability. the far-uv cd spectra of the peptide at 20°c  and 5°c  show a characteristic positive peak at  <dig> nm, which is probably attributable to an edge-to-face exciton couplet between tyr and trp  <cit> , which suggests that the peptide forms a β-hairpin-like structure resembling the corresponding portion of the elements flvc-segment and bpti-segment and the segments in cluster # <dig> that we found in their native states. we also observed reversible thermal refolding when we cooled the peptide solution from 98°c  to 20°c  . as we noted above, the residue conservation patterns in the turn region resembles that of chignolin. we therefore suggest that the residues around the turn region might be important to confer high foldability and stability to the peptide. consequently, these results strongly suggest that the peptide folds autonomously into a unique structure in aqueous solution, and further indicates that segments with sequences similar to the profile of cluster # <dig> probably fold into the same local structure independent of the context . this is true even when no evolutionary relation exists between the folds. these results suggest that the structure-based profiles represented by these clusters reflect the physicochemical preferences of ancient short peptide ancestors. they also suggest the role of the segments as structural building blocks, and the existence of ancient short peptide ancestors.

such speculation can be inferred not only from our results but also from other experimental studies. the peptide described above is not a first short autonomous element, derived from native proteins, that exhibits high foldability and stability. several short fragments such as c-peptide of ribonuclease a  <cit> , a c-terminal helix of cytochrome c  <cit> , g-peptide of protein g  <cit>  and an n-terminal fragment of ubiquitin  <cit>  forms their native-like conformations by themselves, although most isolated fragments cannot retain the original conformation without interactions with the remaining proteins. in addition, several pioneering works have succeeded in creating artificial assemblies that consist of a combination of short fragments as structural building blocks  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in 9-residue-long and 15-residue-long segments, we identified several segment clusters with structure-based profiles that show significant correlations  with sequence-based profiles. we found significant correlation between a sequence-based profile and a structure-based profile, indicating structural similarity between the local structure of a protein family and representatives of a segment cluster. we found exceptionally strong correlation between amino acid preferences and local structures in all except one of the  <dig> 9-residue-long segments  and in  <dig> of the  <dig> 15-residue-long segments . these results suggest strong correlation between sequence substitution patterns and structures for some elements in proteins, in agreement with earlier results  <cit> . results also suggest that our method does not require calculation of the structural similarity between two segments to identify similar segments in both sequence and structure, in contrast to previous studies  <cit> .

although many examples of significant correlations between sequence profiles and structural profiles of protein segments are apparently related to divergent evolution, several sequence-structure patterns that transcend protein family, superfamily, and even fold boundaries were identified. in those cases, the patterns found in the ferredoxin-like fold correspond to structurally equivalent segments within the fold. this example suggests the duplication of ancestral segments.

through cross profile analysis, this report elucidates the preserved sequence-structure patterns, which designate β-hairpin-like structures shared by different protein folds. based on the evolutionary analysis of two distinct proteins, these segments might be examples of convergent evolution using the sequence and structural information of consecutive segments. these results present a clear contrast to those of an earlier study  <cit>  which found exclusively distant evolutionary relations using an order-independent profile-profile method. most examples reported in the present study are apparently not under functional constraints, except for the ef-hand motif. in general, sequence-function correlations such as the catalytic triads and the ef-hand motif are often prominent and are easier to detect than sequence-structure correlations. our cross profile analysis method is able to detect subtle sequence-structure correlation.

irrespective of residue environments in proteins, these segments whose sequence-based profiles show correlation with structure-based profiles of specific clusters  have well-preserved structures. therefore, we examined the conformational properties, in aqueous solution, of a consensus peptide sequence from a cluster with these properties. cd spectral analysis of the peptide solution strongly suggests that the peptide has the property of a short autonomous element that exhibits high foldability and stability. this observation suggests that segments of the clusters that show good correlations with sequence-based profiles are autonomous elements, which are also local sequence/structure motifs, such as those in the i-sites library  <cit> . other reports have described the potential use of local sequence information to improve protein structure prediction. this report describes a new water-soluble β-hairpin-like peptide, which might support the hypothesis of polyphyletic origins of presently existing protein domains. lupas et al.  <cit>  discussed the possibility of the evolution of proteins from peptides and argued that one candidate ancient peptides or fundamental elements of proteins is a β-hairpin-like peptide  <cit> . the results presented here provide new insights into the evolution of protein short segments. moreover, they are expected to be useful in improving our understanding of protein folding and evolutionary mechanisms.
