BACKGROUND
in germinal centers , b cells undergo clonal expansion, somatic hyper-mutation in the variable region of antibody genes  <cit>  and class switch recombination  from igm to igg, iga, and ige  <cit> , processes that are dependent on helper t cells  <cit> . antibodies to the cd <dig> epitope  have been used to identify a t cell type in germinal centers in human tonsils, spleen and lymph nodes. these cells are cd4+ t cells  <cit> , exhibit a memory phenotype   <cit>  and are not cytolytic  <cit> . cd57+ gc-th cells proliferate only when they are tcr-activated in the presence of il- <dig>  <cit> . cd57+ gc-th cells express the b-cell zone homing chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> but not the t cell zone homing chemokine receptor ccr <dig>  a pattern consistent with their specific localization in gc  <cit> . based upon their non-polarized cytokine profile, localization in gc and potential helper activity, it has been proposed that cd57+ gc-th cells may constitute a novel effector t cell subset distinct from other well known effector t cell subsets such as th <dig> and th <dig> cells  <cit> . using a gene expression profiling study, we determined that cd57+ gc-th cells are remotely related to other memory/effector t cells in global gene expression  <cit> . the microarray study also revealed that cd57+ gc-th cells have the unique capacity to produce cxcl <dig>  a follicle chemokine implicated in recruitment of cxcr5+ cells  <cit>  and development of follicles/gcs  <cit> . because of their specific localization in germinal centers, the activities of cd57+ gc-th cells on b cell proliferation and antibody production have been studied by several groups of scientists  <cit> . the results of these previous studies reveled unique features of cd57+ gc-th cells, but, when combined, they are inconclusive and widely vary from negative to neutral or positive in assessing the helper activities of cd57+ gc-th cells.

to clarify and gain more insight into their function in helping b cells, we systematically investigated the capacity of human tonsil cd57+ gc-th cells in inducing b cell ig synthesis in naïve vs. germinal center b  cells in comparison with other t cell subsets in human tonsils. we show that cd57+ gc-th cells are more efficient than other germinal center or interfollicular t cells in supporting b cell production of ig. cd57+ gc-th cells, when compared to other t cells, have better helper activity for gc-b cells than for naïve b cells. cd57+ gc-th cells induced the expression of activation-induced cytosine deaminase  and csr in developing b cells. cd40l, but not other major cytokines, is critical for the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells. il- <dig> positively and tgf-β <dig> negatively regulate the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells.

RESULTS
distribution and identification of t helper cell subsets in tonsils
we examined the distribution of t helper cell subsets in human tonsils based upon the expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  as reported previously  <cit> , most cd57+ cd4+ t cells are located in germinal centers surrounded by igd+ naïve b cells . small numbers of cd57+ t cells were also present in the interfollicular areas  surrounding gc. although some are found in ifa, cd69+ cd4+ t cells were also preferentially found in gc . in contrast, the t cells in ifa were mostly negative for cd <dig> expression. therefore, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> are useful markers to identify cd57+ gc-th cells and other t cell subsets differentially localized in tonsils: cd4+cd57+ cells , cd4+cd57-cd69+ cells , and cd4+cd57-cd69- cells .

cd57+ gc-th cells are highly efficient in supporting ig production by b cells
based upon the information obtained in figure  <dig>  the total tonsil cd4+ t cell population was fractionated into cd57+ gc-th cells , total cd57- t cells, cd57-cd69+ t cells and cd57-cd69- t cells . we compared the b cell helping activity of cd57+ gc-th cells with that of other cd4+ t cell subsets. we co-cultured each of the isolated t cell subsets with syngeneic tonsil cd19+ b cells in the presence of seb, a superantigen that conjugates mhc class ii molecules and tcr . b cell receptors were cross-linked by ab to human ig μ chain and human ig  chain prior to culture to provide bcr activation signals mimicking the antigen signals in vivo. cd57+ gc-th cells were most efficient in inducing b cell production of igm, igg, iga and ige among the t cell subsets examined. cd57- cd69+ t cells, many of which are located in gc in a manner similar to cd57+ gc-th cells, were able to induce the production of antibodies but at significantly lower levels compared to cd57+ gc-th cells . t cell stimulation, in this study by seb, was required for efficient induction of the b cell helper activity as it enhanced ig production up to ~ <dig> .

gc-b cells are the preferred target cells for the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells
because of their specific localization in germinal centers, the physiological target cells for cd57+ gc-th cells would be gc-b cells rather than naïve b cells. we compared the helper activities of cd57+ gc-th cells and cd57- cd69+/- cd4+ t cell subsets for b cells. in this study, we fractionated cd19+ b cells into two groups: igd+cd38- naïve b and cd38+ igd+/- gc b cells as shown in figure 2b. cd57+ gc-th cells, when co-cultured with gc-b cells, were significantly more efficient than cd57-cd69+ t cells in inducing the production of all four isotypes of ig . however, when co-cultured with naive b cells, cd57+ gc-th cells were not significantly different from cd57-cd69+ t cells in their induction capacity of ig . again, the helper activities of total cd57- t cells and cd57-cd69- t cells for naïve and gc-b cells were very low.

the relative composition of igm, igg, iga and ige produced in response to cd57+ gc-th cells in the cultures with gc-b vs. naïve b cells was determined. cd57+ gc-th cells drove the production of igm, igg, iga and ige in descending order . class-switched ig isotypes such as igg and iga were more produced in gc-b cell cultures than in naïve b cell cultures. there was no statistically significant difference between the two t cell subsets  in the composition of ig that they induced.

cd57+ gc-th cells induce aid expression and class switch recombination in b cells
aid expression in the maturating b cells in gc is necessary for csr and somatic hypermutation. we examined whether cd57+ gc-th cells have the capacity to induce aid in b cells. naïve b cells were co-cultured with cd57+ gc-th cells, and aid expression was examined . cd57+ gc-th cells induced aid in activated b cells with peaks around days 3– <dig>  cd57+ gc-th cells were able to induce the expression of productive vhdjh-ch ig transcripts. the major subtypes of ig transcripts in response to cd57+ gc-th cells were igg <dig>  igg <dig>  igg <dig> and iga <dig> . when the peak expression levels of aid and the productive vhdjh-ch igg <dig> transcript  were compared, aid expression preceded the expression of igg <dig> transcript by 1– <dig> days in culture .

ig class switch recombination between tandemly repeated s regions located 5' to each ch gene generates switch circles. we used a nested pcr technique designed to specifically detect switch circles but not genomic ig sequences. freshly isolated gc-b, but not naïve b cells, contained switch circles, which were detected as smeared multiple bands on agarose gels as expected. naïve b cells cultured with cd57+ gc-th cells generated detectable switch circles in a time-dependent manner . we also used a dc-pcr technique  <cit>  to detect γ <dig> and α1/ <dig> switch circles . again, gc-th cells induced switch circles in the naïve b cells cultured with gc-th cells.

cd40l signal is necessary for, while cytokines modulate, the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells
cytokines and cd40l regulate b cell maturation and ig production. we examined whether cd40l, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifn-γ play any roles in the cd57+ gc-th cell-driven b cell production of ig. in cultures with naïve b cells, the blockage of cd40l by neutralizing antibody completely suppressed the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells in inducing the b cell production of igm, igg <dig>  iga and ige . in this case, igg <dig> was measured instead of total igg to avoid cross-reaction of the polyclonal capturing antibody for igg with the neutralizing antibodies to cytokines. blockage of il- <dig> partially but specifically suppressed the production of ige, but it did not significantly suppressed other isotypes. in contrast, blockage of ifn-γ enhanced the production of igm, igg <dig> and iga but not ige. since cd40l is essential for the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells, we examined cd57+ gc-th cells and other t cells for the expression of surface cd40l. freshly isolated cd57+ gc-th cells expressed cd40l, which became up-regulated upon t cell activation within hours , whereas cd4+cd57-cd69- interfollicular t cells did not express cd40l at significant levels. there was no significant difference in the expression of surface cd40l between cd57+ and cd57- cd69+ cells.

in the cultures with gc-b cells, blocking of cd40l again completely suppressed the b cell helping activity of cd57+ gc-th cells . however, il- <dig> neutralization did not significantly affect the ige production induced by cd57+ gc-th cells, an activity different from that for naïve b cells. for gc-b cells, ifn-γ neutralization significantly increased the production of iga as it did for naive b cells. the effects of ifn-γ neutralization on other ig isotypes were smaller. while a slight decrease of ige production in the cultures of gc-b cells and cd57+ gc-th cells was observed, neutralization of endogenous il- <dig> did not have any statistically significant effect on cd57+ gc-th cell-driven ig production in the cultures of either naïve or gc-b cells.

exogenously-added il- <dig> enhances while tgf-β <dig> completely suppresses the b cell helping activity of cd57+ gc-th cells
to further examine the regulatory effect of cytokines, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tgf-β <dig> were exogenously added to the cultures of cd57+ gc-th cells with b cells . in cultures of cd57+ gc-th cells with naïve b cells, exogenously added il- <dig> enhanced the production of some subsets of ig, but this effect was small and not statistically significant . however exogenously added ifn-γ significantly suppressed the production of igg, iga and ige. il- <dig>  when added exogenously, was highly efficient in enhancing the production of the four subsets of ig. tgf-β <dig> completely suppressed the b cell-helping capacity of cd57+ gc-th cells for naive b cells.

in cultures of cd57+ gc-th cells with gc-b cells, il- <dig> was again highly effective in enhancing the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells, while tgf-β <dig> completely suppressed it . ifn-γ partially but significantly suppressed the production of igm, igg, iga and ige. exogenous il- <dig> added to the cultures had no effect on the cd57+ gc-th cell-driven ig production in this condition , which is in line with the negligible effect of anti-il- <dig> on gc-b cells in figure 5b.

discussion
cd57+ gc-th cells are unique cd4+ t cells. they express the follicle homing receptor cxcr <dig> but lack the t cell area localization receptor ccr <dig>  <cit> , and reside specifically in germinal centers  <cit> . cd57+ gc-th cells proliferate only when appropriate signals such as tcr, cd <dig> and il- <dig> are provided  <cit> . gc-th cells are widely disseminated and diverse in their tcr sequence  <cit> . cd57+ gc-th cells can express cd40l, icos and cxcl <dig> but are non-polarized t cells in their cytokine profile  <cit> . it has been controversial and unclear whether cd57+ gc-th cells are intrinsically more efficient in helping b cells than other t cells or they are simply localized in germinal centers without any significant differences from other t cells in their capacity as helpers. in this report, we systematically investigated the effector function of cd57+ gc-th cells in regulation of b cell immunoglobulin production and its regulation.

when compared for their helper activities in inducing ig synthesis by total b cells, cd57+ gc-th cells were most efficient among the t cell subsets in tonsils. cd57+ gc-th cells were particularly more efficient in their helper activity for gc-b cells vs. naïve b cells. cd57-cd69+ t cells were equally efficient to cd57+ gc-th cells in inducing naïve b cell differentiation for ig production, while they were less effective than cd57+ gc-th cells in helping gc-b cells. this preference of cd57+ gc-th cells for gc-b cells is physiologically relevant, since both the helper t cell subset and target b cells are specifically present in germinal centers. therefore, cd57+ gc-th cells would constitute an ideal t helper subset that can drive gc-b cell differentiation in germinal centers.

the effects of cytokines such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ and cd40l on b cells in humans and mice have been well documented. it is considered that cd40l is a critical factor  <cit> , and il- <dig> and il- <dig> are positive factors in regulation of b cell ig production  <cit> . ifn-γ induces class switch to certain isotypes while it inhibits to others  <cit> . in this study of the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells, the positive role of il- <dig> in promoting ig production was valid only for ige, but not igg and iga in the cultures of naïve b cells with cd57+ gc-th cells . gc-b cells were even more resistant to the neutralization of il- <dig> than naïve b cells in cd57+ gc-th-cell driven ig production. this smaller than expected effect of il- <dig> may be due to the fact that there is not much il- <dig> to neutralize in the cultures of gc-th cells. this also suggests that gc-th cells may provide helper signals to gc-b cells that are not significantly affected by il- <dig> 

aid  <cit>  is a molecule essential for somatic hypermutation, csr and ig gene conversion  <cit> . we showed in this study that cd57+ gc-th cells can induce aid expression . this capacity is consistent with their ability to induce class switch recombination, which can be detected within a few days in the cultures of naïve b cells with cd57+ gc-th cells. cd57+ gc-th cells can induce the expression of productive igg1- <dig> and iga <dig> transcripts. however, cd57+ gc-th cells were inefficient in induction of ige , which is consistent with their poor production capacity of il- <dig>  <cit> .

cd40l appears to be essential for the helper activity of cd57+ gc-th cells. cd40l was required for the synthesis of all ig isotypes in all the conditions tested regardless of whether the target b cells for cd57+ gc-th cells were naïve or gc-b cells. while neutralization of il- <dig> did not have any significant effect on the cd57+ gc-th cell-driven ig synthesis, exogenous il- <dig> was highly effective in enhancing the ig synthesis in our study. this could be due to insufficient neutralization of the il- <dig> produced by cd57+ gc-th cells, which are known to produce il- <dig> upon tcr activation  <cit> . another possibility is that higher concentration of il- <dig> than the level produced by cd57+ gc-th cells may be necessary to significantly enhance the ig response. exogenous ifn-γ negatively regulates the cd57+ gc-th cell-driven ig synthesis, suggesting the potential roles of th <dig> cells or other ifn-γ producing cells in regulation of the cd57+ gc-th cells' helper activity. tgf-β <dig> plays dual roles: it is a switch factor for iga and a potent immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits ig synthesis  <cit> . we did not detect any switching effect but were able to detect its suppressive activity for the cd57+ gc-th cell response. this could be due to the fact that the culture conditions  employed in our study appear to favor the detection of the suppressive function of tgf-β. taken together, these results imply that th <dig>  th <dig> and regulatory t cells, if present in germinal centers, could positively or negatively control the function of cd57+ gc-th cells in regulation of humoral immune responses. indeed, there are regulatory t cells in gcs that express surface tgf-β and can effectively suppress the function of cd57+ gc-th cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated the capacity of cd57+ gc-th cells in supporting csr and ig synthesis in b cells, and revealed the factors that regulate their activity, thereby substantiating the so-far inconclusive function of cd57+ gc-th cells. the fact that these t cells have preferential and efficient helper activity for gc-b cells and are specifically localized in gcs in large numbers suggests that cd57+ gc-th cells are probably the major t helper subset responsible for supporting b cell differentiation for ig production in germinal centers.
