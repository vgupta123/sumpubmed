BACKGROUND
fusarium head blight  is a severe disease diffused worldwide affecting a wide range of cereal crops such as wheat  and barley . only in europe the loss due to fhb in wheat harvest is estimated from  <dig> to 30 %  <cit> . the causal agents are mainly fusarium graminearum schwabe  and fusarium culmorum  sacc.  <cit> . these fusarium species are known to produce several mycotoxins, which can accumulate in the grains and are toxic to both animals and humans  <cit> . fhb epidemics in nature can strike suddenly, but its severity can vary depending on climate conditions, being favored by high humidity and rainfall during flowering  <cit> . several authors reported different control measures for fhb , that include the use of agronomic control techniques, wheat genetic resistance and the use of chemical or biological antagonists. the limited time in which the heads are susceptible to fhb infection  makes this disease a potential target for biological control.

the use of microorganisms against plant pathogens has increased in recent years due to consumers’ demand of a reduced chemical products use for the benefits of human health and the environment  <cit> . some successful applications of soil/rhizobacteria as biocontrol agents against fhb, with a reduction of fusarium incidence and mycotoxin level, have already been reported in in vitro assays, greenhouse experiments and field trials . these bacteria can also colonize root surface and enter root tissues, thus becoming endophytic. endophytes are of special interest in the field of biocontrol, as they are harmless to plants and are able to inhabit specific ecological niches  <cit> . from the internal tissues, they can be a source of secondary metabolites acting as elicitors of plant defenses or as antimicrobial agents with potential use to control disease  <cit> . typical examples of these molecules are cyclic lipopeptides  mainly synthesized by species of bacillus and pseudomonas  <cit> . nevertheless the array of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic bacteria remains to be discovered  <cit> .

in addition to these strains, lactobacillus spp. members can be interesting as potential biocontrol agents. they are well known as probiotics and protective microorganisms in food and feed against spoilage bacteria or fungi  <cit> . however, in the agricultural field, their potential use is still sparse, although they can be found inside plant tissues  <cit>  and produce bioactive compounds  with antimicrobial properties against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi. in particular, different molecules are active against fusarium  and some lactobacillus strains have been found to be capable of mycotoxin detoxification  <cit> .

in this work, the inhibitory effect of lactobacillus plantarum slg <dig> and bacillus amyloliquefaciens fnl <dig> was evaluated against strains of f. culmorum and f. graminearum isolated from wheat, and the presence of genes responsible for antimicrobial peptide production was checked. furthermore, the antagonistic efficacy in controlling fhb was studied in field conditions. pcr-dgge analyses on wheat seeds were performed to investigate: a) the microbial community profile of wheat grains upon different treatments; b) the endophytic colonization feature of the microbial inoculants; c) fusarium population in wheat.

RESULTS
antimicrobial activity against fusarium spp
in vitro tests performed on agar plates showed that the two strains used in this work, l. plantarum slg <dig> and b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig>  possessed antimicrobial activity against all the five fusarium strains isolated from diseased wheat . both antagonistic strains did not display reciprocal inhibition . antimicrobial activity of b. amyloliquefaciens fnl <dig> against f. culmorum fc <dig> was also examined using scanning electron microscopy  since hyphae adjacent to the inhibition area in the plate tests revealed an unusual brown color. the adherence of b. amyloliquefaciens fnl <dig> cells on the hyphal surface of f. culmorum fc <dig> is evident, and the contact zone showed shrinkage with loss of turgidness of hyphae  compared to the control grown hyphae . conidia were also subjected to surface alteration . in addition, as shown in fig. 1d, bacterial aggregates close to hyphae embedded in an extracellular matrix could be observed .table  <dig> source of isolation, species identity and fungal inhibition spectra of l. plantarum slg <dig> and b. amyloliquefaciens fln13; values are expressed as mean ± sd

detection of genes for plantaricin and lps synthesis
l. plantarum slg <dig> was positive for plne/f, plnk, plng, plnn genes, whereas the plnj gene was not detected . the pcr assay using degenerated primers followed by cloning and sequencing of the amplified bands allowed the detection of the genes related to the biosynthesis of surfactin, fengycin and mycosubtilin in the genome of b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig> . on the other hand, the ituc fragment, involved in iturin a production, was not detected.table  <dig> blast results of the sequenced products obtained from pcr amplification using gene-specific degenerated primers from biosynthetic genes of mycosubtilin synthase, fengycin synthetase and surfactin synthase in b. amyloliquefaciens fln13



in field trial and fhb assessment in wheat
the isolation of fhb agents in the wheat grains resulted positive , confirming natural infection of the field.

di was not significantly different among the four treatments at gs  <dig>  whereas a few differences were observed in ds, with the highest values present in ctr and bio- <dig>  and the lowest in chem . regarding the fhb index, the lowest value was obtained in chem , being statistically different from all the other treatments .table  <dig> mean values of fhb incidence , disease severity  and fhb index at zadoks growth stage gs  <dig> and gs  <dig> in the different treatments

in the evaluation made at gs  <dig>  the highest di, ds and fhb index were observed in ctr  and bio- <dig>  and no significant differences were observed between them. on the other hand, a significant fhb index reduction was obtained in bio- <dig>  and chem  compared to ctr; in both bio- <dig> and chem the di is statistically different with respect to ctr , whereas ds showed a significant reduction only in chem . the kernel weight was significantly increased  only in chem ; on the other hand, the observed increase in bio- <dig> was not significant compared to ctr . bio- <dig> had a kernel weight lower than ctr  .

pcr-dgge analysis
wheat seed bacterial community was firstly investigated in all treatment condition by pcr-dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments targeting total eubacteria. profiles of the bacterial communities and upgma dendrogram are shown in fig. 2a and b. the cluster analysis showed a distinct division between bio- <dig> and the group ctr, chem and bio- <dig> , and a further division distinguishes ctr from chem and bio- <dig> profiles.fig.  <dig> dgge patterns of eubacterial 16s rdna fragments amplified from wheat seeds  and cluster analysis ; ctr: untreated subplots; chem: prothioconazole treated subplots; bio-1: subplots treated with l. plantarum slg <dig> and b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig> ; bio-2: subplots treated twice with l. plantarum slg <dig> and b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig> at zadoks growth stage  <dig> and 70; lad: ladder with known microorganism. a: l. plantarum slg17; b: b. amyloliquefaciens fln13



sequencing of selected bands evidenced the presence of five different bacterial species . band  <dig>  detected in chem and bio- <dig>  showed 100 % similarity to lysobacter soli, while bands  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  had 100 % similarity to pantoea agglomerans. bands  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed 100 % identity with erwinia rhapontici; bands  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were identified as rahnella acquatilis . dgge fingerprints targeting lactobacilli were rather simple, with a few well-defined bands , not detectable in all samples. bands  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were particularly visible in the ctr profile while their intensity decreased in the profiles bio- <dig> and bio- <dig>  these bands and band  <dig>  had 100 % identity with exiguobacterium sibiricum . bands  <dig> and  <dig> were detected only in bio- <dig> and bio- <dig> profile, and had the same migration distance of bands  <dig> and  <dig>  which represent l. plantarum in the ladder profile. these four bands were also excised and sequenced, showing 100 % similarity with l. plantarum . unexpectedly, primers targeting lactobacilli allowed the amplification of b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig>  which was thus present in this dgge profile. an in silico evaluation of lac <dig> and lac <dig> primer sequences on 16s rdna of bacillus spp. evidenced a possible amplification of the ribosomal dna.table  <dig> eubacteria sequence alignment with blast

discussion
the use of microorganisms for pathogen control in plants is largely studied and applied to several crops of economic value, with consequent reduction of the spread of chemical agents in the environment. bacillus spp. are the most commercially successful biocontrol agents, with more than  <dig> bacillus-based registered formulations  <cit> , whereas lactobacillus spp. strains, although included in multi-strain bio-fertilizers  <cit> , have rarely been used for biocontrol intervention strategy  <cit> . in this work, two bacterial strains, b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig> and l. plantarum slg <dig>  previously selected for their strong inhibitory activity against several plant pathogenic fungi, were checked for their in vitro antifungal activity against strains of f. culmorum and f. graminearum and, as a mixture, they were tested for their potential to control fhb in durum wheat in field.

l. plantarum slg <dig> exhibited antimicrobial activity against the tested fusarium strains, and a consistent number of genes responsible for plantaricin production. beside the role of organic acids which are known to be detrimental for pathogen growth  <cit> , a possible action of plantaricins in the antagonist activity against fhb agents can be suggested. moreover, results obtained from dgge profiles of seeds deriving from wheat subjected to both biological treatments  demonstrated that l. plantarum slg <dig> was able to enter the internal tissues of spikelets to become an endophyte. although no direct evidence  was given to show the penetration of the sprayed microorganism, the absence of bands ascribed to l. plantarum in the ctr profile strengthen the hyphotesis of the endophytic behavior of l. plantarum slg <dig>  moreover, no data on lactobacillus detection on wheat seeds are at present available in the literature, unless in silage fermentation  <cit> . in addition, b. amyloliquefaciens fln <dig> was also able to inhibit in vitro all tested fusarium strains and possessed the synthetase genes responsible for mycosubtilin, fengycin and surfactin production, which are known to be among the molecules  involved in the antagonistic activity against plant pathogens  <cit> . in the in vitro antagonistic assay, morphological changes were observed by sem analyses in the hyphae and macroconidia of f. culmorum fc <dig>  associated with the presence of an extracellular matrix . these effects on fungi have already been described by several authors in the presence of different species of bacillus, as a result of cell wall degradation, increased cell adhesion and lipopeptide excretion  <cit> . in addition, gong et al.  <cit>  clearly showed the destructive effect of secondary metabolites  from b. amyloliquefaciens s76- <dig> in f. graminearum conidia and hyphae. unfortunately, no evidence on the presence of this strain inside wheat seeds was found in the pcr-dgge profiles. as also reported by crane et al.  <cit> , following application of b. amyloliquefaciens strain trigocor on wheat, most bacillus cells were present post-application as metabolically dormant spores, thus hindering potential internalization in the host plant. it should also be emphasised that the detection limit for dgge is in the order of 103 cfu/ml  <cit> ; as a consequence, microbial groups that are present and active, but whose population is lower than 103 cfu/ml, will not be evidenced.

beside the clear efficacy of the fungicide treatment, the field trial showed, at gs  <dig>  a significant fhb index reduction  in bio- <dig> compared to the untreated subplots. therefore, the efficacy of a preventive and repetitive treatment with the applied mixture of microorganisms was demonstrated, although this was not associated with a significant increase in kernel yield. on the other hand, the treatment applied twice at flowering  was not effective. this last result is different from what obtained by schisler et al.  <cit>  who showed a significant ds and di reduction by using a b. subtilis/amyloliquefaciens strain at flowering in a field trial. however, as pointed out by the same author and by crane et al.  <cit> , several factors can contribute to the successful application of fhb antagonists in the field, such as the decline of antagonistic molecule levels on wheat surface within a few days, the deleterious effects of ultraviolet light, available nutrients, host variety and runoff from rainfall and irrigation. last but not least, the intrinsic properties of the applied microorganisms and the inoculation technology should also be considered.

the identification of excised bands from the dgge profiles evidenced the detection of different microbial species , commonly isolated from plant tissues  <cit>  and the presence of f. culmorum and f. graminearum, confirming their endemic presence in wheat kernels. finally, the pcr-dgge, targeting lactobacilli, allowed the detection of l. plantarum in bio- <dig> and bio- <dig> seeds, indicating that the inoculated strain was able to become endophyte. this observation confirms that endophytes may not only derive from the rizosphere, but, as reviewed by compant et al.  <cit> , they may also originate from other sources, such as the phyllosphere, the anthosphere, or the spermosphere.

CONCLUSIONS
the obtained results suggest a possible use of the two microorganisms in controlling fhb spread throughout all the heading and ripening period, aimed at protecting the spikelets before and during anthesis. moreover, the endophytic colonization of l. plantarum, which is one of the most characterized and used probiotic lactobacillus species, can help to increase the nutritional properties of wheat and derived products . further studies are necessary to deeply investigate the interaction with the host plant, the metabolite production of both strains and improve the inoculation technology.
