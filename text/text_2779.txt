BACKGROUND
the need to sleep is near universal among animal species, including humans
 <cit> , yet the function of sleep remains puzzling. sleep disorders have a devastating impact on human health. for example, individuals with narcolepsy can experience loss of muscle control and intense hallucinations during waking, which directly interferes with conscious activity
 <cit> . restless leg syndrome is a sensation of discomfort in the lower limbs during the evening that results in an inability to sleep
 <cit> . similarly, obstructive sleep apnea is a closing of the upper airway during sleep, restricting the brain’s access to oxygen
 <cit> . individuals with these sleep disorders suffer from increased daytime sleepiness and decreased cognitive performance
 <cit> . poor sleep habits as well as disordered sleep are risk factors for other diseases, such as obesity, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and depression
 <cit> . sleep patterns and duration vary both among species and within species
 <cit> , due in part to segregating genetic variation
 <cit> , implying that sleep and risk factors for sleep disorders are at least partly under genetic control. however, the genes maintaining genetic variation in sleep are not known.

sleep characteristics in mammals have been observed in drosophila melanogaster, which facilitates the use of this powerful genetic model organism to study sleep
 <cit> . drosophila has several key advantages over mammals. one advantage is the extensive collections of stocks with mapped mutations, chromosomal deletions, and transgenic modifications that can be directly tested for their impact on sleep. a second key advantage is the ability to phenotype flies with identical genotypes under controlled environmental conditions, enabling the detection of environmental sensitivity and genotype-by-environment interactions. several studies have already capitalized on community resources, together screening more than  <dig>  mutations for their effects on sleep
 <cit> . a small number of mutations  have major effects on sleep
 <cit> , but many mutations have more subtle quantitative effects
 <cit> . a complementary approach to mutagenesis is to identify loci at which alleles with more subtle effects segregate in natural populations
 <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphisms , insertions, and deletions in a natural population of flies are mutations that have survived the filter of natural selection and can be tested via genome-wide association  for effects on genetic variation in sleep
 <cit> . here, we use a new community resource, the drosophila genetic reference panel 
 <cit> , to identify snps associated with natural variation in sleep. the dgrp is a panel of inbred lines that were created by mating full siblings of wild-caught isofemale lines for  <dig> generations
 <cit> . the availability of full sequence data, the rapid decay in linkage disequilibrium  with physical distance, and the lack of population structure in the dgrp
 <cit>  are advantageous conditions for a gwa study of sleep.

using continuous sleep and activity data recordings from groups of individuals with identical genotypes, we calculated sleep duration, the number of sleep bouts or ‘naps’, and average sleep bout length during the day and night. we also measured waking activity, a measure that describes the activity level relative to the time spent awake. all parameters of sleep architecture, as well as waking activity, were genetically variable among the dgrp lines. in addition, we observed considerable variability in sleep among flies with identical genotypes, and the environmental sensitivity with respect to sleep parameters was also genetically variable. we performed gwa analyses for the mean and environmental sensitivity of each sleep trait in the dgrp, and found many snps individually associated with each sleep trait, often with sex-specific effects. most  snps associated with the mean and environmental variance of sleep had relatively low minor allele frequencies . additive multi-snp models revealed that 1– <dig> snps could explain  <dig> - <dig> % of the genetic variance in sleep for females, and  <dig> - <dig> % of the genetic variance in sleep for males. while further work is required to identify causal variants, we found that individual snps associated with sleep traits were located in genes known to have effects on sleep in flies, in genes over-represented in the epidermal growth factor receptor  pathway, and in genes with homologs previously implicated in human sleep. low-frequency alleles were associated with increased environmental sensitivity. further, genes associated with sleep had signatures of purifying selection
 <cit> . these observations raise the intriguing possibility that sleep may be canalized in heterogeneous natural populations
 <cit> .

RESULTS
quantitative genetic analyses
we measured day and night sleep duration, average bout length, bout number and waking activity, separately for males and females, in  <dig> dgrp lines. quantitative genetic analyses of each trait revealed substantial and highly significant genetic variation among the lines for the mean of each trait . estimates of broad sense heritability  for night sleep, day sleep, night bout number, day bout number, night average bout length, day average bout length, and waking activity, were, respectively h2 =  <dig> , h2 =  <dig> , h2 =  <dig> , h2 =  <dig> , h2 =  <dig> , h2 =  <dig>  and h2 =  <dig>  . all sleep traits except for night average bout length and night sleep duration were highly sexually dimorphic . however, for all traits there was substantial genetic variation in sexual dimorphism , as shown by differences in genetic variance between females and males for most traits; significant sex by line interaction terms; and cross-sex genetic correlations  ranging from a low of rmf =  <dig>  for day bout number to a high of rmf =  <dig>  for waking activity . thus we expect that some polymorphisms will affect sleep in both sexes, while others will have sex-specific or sex-biased effects. the range of variation in sleep traits encompassed by the dgrp lines is astonishing , with mean sleep duration spanning much of the possible 24-hour spectrum. night sleep times ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes in females and from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes in males ; females tended to sleep slightly longer during the night than males . day sleep duration ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes in females and from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes in males . as previously noted in other natural populations of flies
 <cit>  males generally slept more during the day than females .

sleep was highly variable among individual flies with identical genotypes , and most variable in lines having the shortest mean sleep times. we calculated the environmental coefficient of variation  for all sleep parameters to determine whether there was genetic variation in the magnitude of environmental sensitivity; i.e., whether some lines are relatively more canalized and others more phenotypically plastic in response to the same random environmental effects
 <cit> . here, the cve for sleep between individuals can be estimated directly for replicates of each line as flies from a given line in the dgrp have identical genotypes . we partitioned the variance in cve between and within lines . we found that cve had a significant genetic component for all sleep traits, with h2 =  <dig>  for night sleep duration cve, h2 =  <dig>  for day sleep duration cve, h2 =  <dig>  for night bout number cve, h2 =  <dig>  for day bout number cve, h2 =  <dig>  for night average bout length cve, h2 =  <dig>  for day average bout length cve, and h2 =  <dig>  for waking activity cve . all traits but waking activity exhibited sexual dimorphism for cve, with generally greater sensitivity to environmental variation in females than males . there was genetic variation in the magnitude of cve between males and females for night sleep, day sleep, night bout number, and day bout number, with cross-sex genetic correlation estimates of rmf =  <dig> , rmf =  <dig> , rmf =  <dig>  and rmf =  <dig> , respectively . thus, we expect to be able to identify genetic variants affecting environmental sensitivity for sleep traits, and some of these variants will be the same for males and females, while others will be sex-specific or sex-biased.

we computed genetic correlations between lines for the mean value and cve of each sleep trait to assess the extent to which the same variants affect both the mean and environmental sensitivity. there were strong negative genetic correlations  between night and day sleep duration and cve  . for these traits, we expect largely the same variants to affect the mean and environmental sensitivity. this pattern held for most, but not all, sleep traits. the correlations were rg = − <dig>  for night bout number, rg = − <dig>  for day bout number, rg = − <dig>  for night average bout length, rg =  <dig>  for day average bout length, and rg =  <dig>  for waking activity . the low rg for night average bout length implies that variants affecting the mean do not affect environmental sensitivity, and vice versa; however, the lower genetic correlations are also in part due to lower heritabilities of both mean and sensitivity. mean phenotypic values of all sleep parameters in the dgrp lines are given in additional file
 <dig> 

genotype-phenotype associations
the dgrp lines have been sequenced
 <cit> . we used  <dig> , <dig> snps for which the minor allele is present in at least four lines to conduct gwa analyses for the mean and cve of all sleep traits. with this number of snps there is a distinct possibility of many false positives; we therefore limited our significance threshold to a false discovery rate  of  <dig>  or lower for each sleep trait. we found many snps associated with the mean and coefficient of environmental variation of most sleep traits using this threshold . the exceptions were day sleep and night bout number, for which none of the associations met this threshold. as has been observed in human studies
 <cit> , many snps were located in intergenic regions  and in introns , while fewer snps were found in coding sequences , roughly corresponding to the amount of dna in the genome for these three categories 
 <cit> . consistent with the high genetic correlation between the mean and environmental variance for sleep duration,  <dig> % of the snps overlapped between night sleep mean and cve . as expected from the quantitative genetic analyses of sleep phenotypes, the snps significantly associated with sleep were often sex-specific or sex-biased. we classified snps as sex-specific , sex-biased , or sex-antagonistic 
 <cit> . the overwhelming majority of snps exhibited some degree of sex dimorphism:  <dig> % percent of the snps were sex-specific,  <dig> % were sex-biased, and  <dig> % were sex-antagonistic, with the remaining  <dig> % affecting both sexes equally . quantile-quantile  plots for each sleep trait show p-values deviating from the expected distribution for some of the sleep traits. we therefore investigated whether sleep was influenced by population structure due to cryptic relatedness in the dgrp. correcting the association tests for relatedness resulted in no appreciable differences in the q-q plots  or distributions of p-values , suggesting that the deviations are not caused by population admixture. although on average ld decays rapidly with physical distance in the dgrp
 <cit> , there is great variation around this average decay, such that there are some regions of local ld, including ld associated with polymorphic inversions. we speculated that this local ld could cause the appearance of structure in the q-q plots. we therefore assessed whether the presence or absence of common inversions in the dgrp  were associated with sleep traits. indeed, day average bout length, day average bout length cve, and waking activity cve were significantly associated with the ln_3r_mo  inversion; day average bout length, day bout number, and day average bout length cve were associated with the ln_2r_ns  inversion; and day sleep, day sleep cve, night bout cve, and day bout cve were associated with the ln_2l_t inversion. we also observed many instances of local ld independent of the inversions. for night sleep, the largest regions of ld were a ~ <dig>  kb region of ld from the intronic region of cg <dig> to the intronic region of fog, and a smaller  <dig> bp region just forward of and within cg <dig> on the x chromosome; a ~ <dig>  kb region of ld between an intergenic region forward of cg <dig> and within the intronic region of rbp <dig> on chromosome 3l; and ld between almost exclusively male-specific snps in a ~ <dig> kb region spanning the intergenic region between α catenin and argonaute  <dig>  as well as within argonaute  <dig> introns for both night sleep and night sleep cve on 3l . there were no large ld regions associated with day average bout length , but many small regions were identified. for waking activity, we observed ld between snps in a ~ <dig>  kb region on chromosome 2r between snps in the coding region of cg <dig> and the region forward of rpl <dig> . for day sleep cve, we observed ld in a region surrounding and including ms34fe on chromosome 2l . it is not possible to distinguish causal snps within chromosomal inversions and regions of localized ld. furthermore, it is not possible to incorporate the effects of the inversions in the gwa model as the genotype of each snp is confounded with the presence or the absence of the inversion. we therefore designated one snp as a proxy for all the significant snps found in a given chromosomal inversion or region of ld for the purpose of tallying the total number of significant snps, which reduced the total number of significant snps by 18-40% . additional files
 <dig> and
 <dig> provide detailed information on each significant snp in this study, including the classification of snps within ld blocks and chromosomal inversions.

*numbers of snps listed have fdr ≤  <dig> ; numbers of snps accounting for inversions and local ld blocks are listed in parentheses. see text for additional detail.

** low frequency is defined here as  <dig>  ≤ minor allele frequency ≤  <dig> .

most snps associated with sleep trait means and cve were at the low range of the allele frequency spectrum, with minor allele frequencies between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . low frequency alleles were associated with short night sleep duration, long day average bout length, and increased waking activity. interestingly, the lines most sensitive to random environmental perturbations, i.e., the lines with the highest cve, had a preponderance of low-frequency alleles; this was a feature of the cve for all sleep traits. as anticipated, low minor allele frequencies were associated with larger effect sizes for all sleep traits , and effect sizes for each snp were large . the genetic variance  explained by each snp in a population of inbred lines is vg = 4pqa <dig>  where p and q are the frequencies of the major and minor alleles, and a is one half of the difference in mean between lines bearing the major and minor alleles
 <cit> . summing the genetic variance over all snps overestimates the total genetic variance. this is because snps are not totally independent due to chromosomal inversions and residual ld ; the threshold chosen to minimize false negative associations will include variable numbers of false positive associations; and the truncated distribution of effect sizes, in addition to sample size considerations, leads to an overestimation of the amount of variance explained known as the beavis effect
 <cit> . we therefore performed iterative gwa analyses that estimated the additive effects of multiple snps simultaneously. we found that 1– <dig> snps could be used to explain  <dig> - <dig> % of the genetic variance in sleep in females, and  <dig> - <dig> % of the genetic variance in sleep in males . roughly half  of the snps we found using the additive multi-snp model were also significant as a single snp; the remainder only appear when considered as part of the multi-snp model.

further experimental work is required in order to definitively identify causal snps, particularly those within inversions or regions of local ld. however, we note that many of the snps are in plausible candidate genes, including  <dig> genes in which mutations were previously associated with drosophila sleep , and  <dig> genes for which the human ortholog has been associated with sleep and sleep disorders in humans, nine of which are not in ld with other genes 82fd, nude, ppan, and trbl) and one  that is in ld with other potential candidate genes . of the  <dig>  genes associated with one or more sleep traits,  <dig> are associated with potentially functional missense or nonsense mutations
 <cit> ;  <dig> are expressed in the adult brain and  <dig> are expressed in the larval cns
 <cit> . the coding sequence of most genes associated with sleep  appeared to be under purifying selection, consistent with previous observations
 <cit> , but some genes  were rapidly evolving
 <cit> . several  genes were previously identified as quantitative trait transcripts associated with natural variation in sleep in  <dig> dgrp lines
 <cit> ; and  <dig> genes, although previously not implicated in sleep, are associated with snps with p-values exceeding a bonferroni correction  for multiple tests.

we hypothesized that the list of genes associated with snps affecting one or more sleep traits would be enriched for causality. if so, groups of genes should be enriched for particular gene ontology  terms or pathways
 <cit> . we found  <dig>  go terms that exceeded a p-value of  <dig>  . genes involved in developmental processes of all kinds were a common theme for all sleep traits, including nervous system development and axonogenesis. further, we found significant enrichment for genes associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor  pathway . egfr signaling has recently been implicated in d. melanogaster sleep in an independent study
 <cit> . we used the biogrid data base of genes with known physical and genetic interactions
 <cit>  to query our snp list for genes that may interact with egfr. a total of  <dig> genes implicated by the sleep gwa analyses formed a candidate interaction network with genes from the egfr pathway .

functional tests
we selected mutations and rnai knockdown constructs in eleven genes to evaluate effects on the mean and cve of selected sleep traits, using the criteria that the corresponding snps had high statistical significance in the gwa analyses , the genes were ‘hubs’ in the egfr interaction network , and the mutant or rnai alleles were available from drosophila stock collections with co-isogenic controls. we tested p-element insertions in frizzled , thickveins , ultrabithorax , and vesicular monoamine transporter  for their effects on sleep. we also tested the effect of pan-neuronal knockdown of gene expression on sleep using rnai constructs in candidate genes for sleep. we used an elav-gal <dig> driver to reduce the expression of these genes in all neurons . we tested rnai constructs in brinker , cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  hairy/e-related with yrpw motif , scribbled , and unc- <dig>  vmat, brk, cg <dig>  scrib, and unc- <dig> were implicated in night sleep. many significant snps were present in vmat introns and the 3′-utr; these snps were significant for males, females, sexes pooled, and snp × sex interactions. brk and cg <dig> had at least one snp in the coding region; these snps were significant for sexes pooled and females separately in the gwas. many snps significant for females as well as both sexes pooled were located in the intergenic region of unc- <dig>  but this gene is nested within an intron of a larger gene, cg1677; the snps in scrib were also intronic. tests of the vmat mutation for night sleep revealed a significant genotype × sex interaction, partially confirming the gwas observation. the putative rna reduction in brk, cg <dig> and unc- <dig> gene expression resulted in significant differences from the control in females and averaged over both sexes, confirming the gwas results. however night sleep in scrib was not significantly different from the control . we tested two mutations  and seven rnai constructs  for their impact on night sleep cve. a single snp in an intron of fz was significant for females only in the gwas. cg <dig>  cg <dig> and hey had snps significant for both sexes in the genome-wide association that were located in the 5′-utr, the 3′-utr, and in an intron, respectively. only the cg <dig> and hey rnai constructs had effects on night sleep cve that were consistent with the gwas analysis . we also evaluated the effect of mutations on day average bout length. in the gwas, a female-specific snp in the 3′-utr of vmat and intronic snps in ubx were implicated in day average bout length; however, mutations in these genes failed to replicate these findings . we tested mutations in tkv and ubx for their impact on day bout number cve as snps in introns of these genes were significant for both sexes, but we did not find any change in phenotype due to these mutations . finally, we tested three mutations  and one rnai construct  for their effect on waking activity cve. the mutation in fz was significantly different from the control for sexes combined, replicating the gwas finding .

although we specifically tested the mutations and rnai constructs for the effects outlined above, we observed significant effects on other sleep phenotypes as well. in fact, every gene tested exhibited pleiotropy . we observed pleiotropic effects in night sleep ; night sleep cve ; day average bout length ; and day bout number cve . in general, the pleiotropy occurred in sleep phenotypes having some degree of genetic correlation with the trait of interest . these confirmatory tests demonstrate that candidate genes impacting both mean and cve sleep phenotypes can be identified from their respective snp associations, and mutations in these genes can also influence these traits as well as other correlated traits .

discussion
the dgrp is a new community resource for gwa analysis of complex traits
 <cit> . the dgrp lines harbor most common variants and a representative sample of rare variants that have survived natural selection, and the ~ <dig>  million snps interrogated in gwa studies represent novel, subtle variants that are unlikely to be produced by mutagenesis screens. we found substantial genetic variation for sleep traits in the dgrp, as has been observed previously in natural populations of flies
 <cit> . a prominent feature of the genetic architecture of naturally occurring variation for all sleep traits is variation in sex dimorphism among the lines. using a conservative fdr threshold of  <dig> , we found a total of  <dig>  unique snps associated with night sleep duration, day bout number, day and night average bout length, and waking activity. some snps were in genomic regions containing chromosomal inversions or local ld; consequently, we could not distinguish among candidate snps in these regions. defining a proxy snp for those snps within inversions or ld groups reduced the putative number of snps to  <dig>  snps. consistent with the observation of genetic variation in sex dimorphism, the majority of snps had effects that were either specific to one sex or sex-biased. a few snps were sex-antagonistic, i.e., with opposite effects in males and females. interestingly, some snps were located within the canonical sex determination gene fruitless. however, the mechanism underlying sex-specific or sex-biased snp effects on sleep phenotypes is unknown.

variation in quantitative traits is traditionally partitioned into genetic  and environmental  variance, where the environmental variance reflects variation among individuals due to non-genetic causes
 <cit> . in experimental populations reared under constant environmental conditions, ve reflects variation among individuals due to sensitivity, or plasticity, of alleles to intangible environmental variance. evidence has been accumulating recently that there is often genetic variation in environmental sensitivity
 <cit> ; i.e., different genotypes exhibit more or less variation in the face of minor environmental perturbations
 <cit> . if environmental variation is at least partially under genetic control, then trait values will be inconsistent for highly sensitive genotypes
 <cit> . it would not be sufficient, therefore, to know only those variants that are risk alleles for the mean phenotypes used in diagnosis because one could not accurately predict which individuals would be afflicted. environmental sensitivity may explain in part why some risk alleles are present in unaffected individuals
 <cit> . currently, the genetic architecture of genetic variation in environmental variation is not known. do the same variants that affect the trait mean also affect differences in environmental variation, or is genetic variation in the mean and environmental variance uncorrelated? the dgrp population of inbred lines derived from wild-caught flies is an ideal scenario for estimating the extent to which there is genetic variation in environmental plasticity and mapping genetic variants associated with these traits. we found substantial genetic variance in environmental variance, measured as the coefficient of environmental variance, cve, to correct for any correlation between the mean and variance within a genotype.

we found  <dig>  snps associated with cve of sleep traits;  <dig>  of which were in intergenic regions and  <dig>  in an annotated gene. although the trait mean was not correlated with cve for night average bout length, all other sleep traits were correlated with their respective cve to some degree, and in several cases, the correlation between trait mean and cve was strong. for example, nearly all of the snps associated with mean night sleep duration  were also associated with cve of night sleep. flies with short-sleeping genotypes tend to have higher cve and are thus more sensitive to changes in the micro-environment, making short sleep an inherently less stable phenotype than long sleep. this apparent instability has also been observed in severe short-sleeping mutants of d. melanogaster, where genetic modifiers increasing sleep tend to accumulate
 <cit> . for all sleep traits, low-frequency alleles were associated with genotypes having higher cve, i. e., higher sensitivity, and common alleles were associated with more canalized genotypes. this observation suggests that if low frequency alleles are deleterious, they could ‘escape’ natural selection because some individuals with low frequency alleles will have the same phenotype as those bearing the common allele.

the majority of loci implicated to affect sleep in our analysis of natural variants are novel, many are in non-coding, intergenic regions, and several snps could potentially affect more than one gene. in total, we found  <dig>  genes associated with one or more mean or cve sleep traits, including  <dig> genes previously associated with sleep in d. melanogaster, such as epidermal growth factor receptor <cit> , bunched <cit> , pigment-dispersing factor receptor <cit> , rhomboid <cit> , shaker <cit> , and syndecan <cit>  . we searched the ncbi homologene  data base
 <cit>  to assess whether candidate genes from this study had homologues of genes previously implicated in human sleep studies, and identified  <dig> genes with human homologues affecting normal sleep characteristics as well as the sleep disorders narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome , and sleep apnea . a single human study has associated snps in the framingham heart study offspring cohort with normal sleep characteristics including daytime sleepiness, usual bedtime, and sleep duration. daytime sleepiness, a subjective assessment made by study participants using the epworth sleepiness scale, was associated with several snps, including a snp in an intron of phosphodiesterase 4d  and one in the intron of eyes absent  <dig> 
 <cit> . in our study, the fly homologs of these genes, dunce and eyes absent, were also associated with sleep . a non-synonymous snp in neuropeptide s receptor  <dig>  was associated with usual bedtime, an indicator of diurnal preference, in the human study
 <cit> . we found snps in the fly homolog of this gene, cg <dig>  sleep duration was associated with nuclear receptor coactivator  <dig>  in humans
 <cit> , and its fly homolog l82fd was associated with night sleep and waking activity in flies.

we also found homologs of human candidate genes for sleep disorders. narcolepsy is a chronic condition characterized by intense sleepiness during the day and disturbed sleep patterns at night. in some cases, individuals also experience cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle control. narcolepsy may be the result of the immune system attacking its own hypocretin neurons, as several loci associated with narcolepsy are involved in immune system function, such as the purinergic receptor p2y <dig>  gene
 <cit> . further, antibodies of tribbles homolog  <dig>  were increased in the blood of narcoleptic patients
 <cit> , although their presence may not be causal
 <cit> . linkage mapping of a large family identified a region that includes down syndrome cell adhesion molecule  precursor in narcolepsy
 <cit> . fly homologues of these human genes, peter pan, tribbles, and dscam, had significant snps associated with sleep phenotypes .

we also found snps associated with fly sleep in three genes that are homologous to candidate genes identified for restless leg syndrome , a neurological disorder distinguished by pronounced discomfort in the lower limbs that leads to disturbed sleep patterns. loci implicated in rls gwa studies include the developmental gene meis homeobox  <dig> 
 <cit>  and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type d 
 <cit> ; we found significant snps in their fly counterparts - homothorax and leukocyte-antigen-related-like, respectively, though lar is located in a block of local ld .

like narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea results in daytime sleepiness; but it is the result of closure of the upper airway during sleep, blocking oxygen intake for short periods and thereby disrupting sleep. apolipoprotein e  is associated with sleep apnea in a context-dependent manner, with the association stronger in younger individuals, and those with cardiovascular disease or hypertension
 <cit> . the fly homolog of apoe, nude, was implicated in our study.

while the dgrp fly lines do not represent models of these human sleep disorders, it is remarkable that many homologues of candidate genes for human sleep as well as sleep disorders emerge in this association study of endogenous sleep phenotypes in flies. if one assumes that human sleep disorders are the result of mis-regulation of normal sleep genes, this observation suggests that the role of these genes in sleep may be conserved across species
 <cit> .

we identified a network of  <dig> genes associated with sleep phenotypes in the dgrp that are known to interact either genetically or physically with egfr . prior analyses have demonstrated effects of a few of these genes on adult sleep in drosophila <cit> ; therefore the network generates testable hypotheses. we tested for altered sleep phenotypes in six novel candidate genes from the network: brk, fz, hey, scrib, tkv, and ubx, all of which have been previously studied for their role in development. we demonstrated that a p-element insertion in fz and pan-neuronal reduction in gene expression in brk and hey recapitulated the gwas results. fz is involved in synapse development and in planar cell polarity
 <cit> . brk is a dna-binding protein that can act to repress genes that are the targets of decapentaplegic signaling
 <cit> . hey is a transcription factor that is a target of notch signaling in neuroblasts, and exhibits notch-independent expression in precursor neurons of the mushroom bodies as well
 <cit> . that these genes, along with many of the genes identified in this gwas, have a role in neural development and cellular morphogenesis begs the question of whether sleep behavior is partly the result of neural architecture, or whether the genes have an additional role in the adult fly. the gwas results suggest that biological processes in addition to neural development play a role in sleep, however. we tested genes affecting other biological processes, as well as three genes with unknown function . note that unc- <dig>  a homolog of the c. elegans unc- <dig> gene
 <cit> , and brinker are within the intron of a larger gene, cg <dig>  it is not clear at this point which of these genes may be relevant to sleep. we also tested a mutation in vmat, which transports dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine
 <cit> , monoamines known to affect sleep in drosophila <cit> . we saw significant differences in the expected sleep phenotypes for rnai constructs of cg <dig> and unc- <dig>  and a p-element insertion in vmat.

all of these mutations and rnai constructs exhibited significant effects in sleep phenotypes other than those tested, revealing pervasive pleiotropy. the bg <dig> p-element insertion in fz, for example, was the most highly pleiotropic mutant we observed. we chose it to test it based on the night sleep cve and waking activity cve gwas results, yet significant pleiotropic effects were observed in day and night bout number, day and night sleep, day and night average bout length, day and night bout number cve, and day and night average bout length cve . we observed  <dig> instances of pleiotropy in the tested candidate genes. most of the unexpected pleiotropic effects  occurred between sleep traits with statistically significant  genetic correlations in the dgrp population . pleiotropic effects of a mutation or rnai allele that were not observed in the dgrp population can occur because genetic correlations in a natural population are indicative of pleiotropic effects of naturally occurring alleles that are in the same direction. further, the effect sizes for most snps associated with sleep traits are in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  standard deviations, which is relatively small compared to the effects that might be expected with a null mutation. thus, only when a mutation or rnai construct is sufficiently severe do we observe the effect on a correlated sleep trait. either or both of these factors could account for the unexpected pleiotropic effects of tested candidate genes on day bout number and waking activity, which were not correlated with the traits being tested . we observed substantial pleiotropy at the level of individual snps as well as at the level of genes . given the generally rapid decay of ld in this population 
 <cit> , non-overlapping snps that are associated with different traits may evolve independently, as has been observed previously
 <cit> . in total, we observed  <dig> snps and  <dig> genes associated with two or more sleep traits.

the above discussion does not include snps associated with sleep traits in chromosomal inversions and regions of local ld. three chromosomal inversions were significantly associated with sleep: ln_2l_t, which was significantly associated with day sleep, day sleep cve, day bout number cve, and night bout number cve; ln_2r_ns, which was significantly associated with day average bout length mean and cve and day bout number; and ln_3r_mo, which was significantly associated with day average bout length mean and cve and waking activity cve. furthermore, we found  <dig> and  <dig> regions of local ld for mean and cve sleep traits, respectively . the vast majority of these ld regions  contain  <dig> or fewer snps. we cannot distinguish which of the snps in these regions are potentially causal from the gwa analyses. it may be possible to determine the snps that are causal in ld regions by crossing lines of the dgrp together and performing a second association study once recombination has occurred over several generations. the chromosomal inversions present a more challenging problem, however, as recombination is effectively suppressed in these regions.

here we associated fourteen sleep phenotypes with  <dig> , <dig> snps in the dgrp. although this analysis was blind to snps with minor allele frequencies less than  <dig>  and non-snp variants , we nevertheless found that a few snps in purely additive multi-snp models could explain a large fraction of the genetic variance. this is in sharp contrast to the situation in human gwa studies
 <cit> , in which individuals snps explain only a small proportion of the total phenotypic variance. this is likely in part because sleep measures in this study were replicated for each genotype, which increases the statistical confidence in these measures. in addition, all flies were reared under controlled environmental conditions from staging the parental cultures until sleep and activity monitoring were completed at the adult stage. one potential reason for the ‘missing’ heritability in human association studies
 <cit>  is that the true causal variants are not common, and thus poorly tagged by common snps used in the genotyping platforms
 <cit> . our association study included all variants with frequencies greater than  <dig> %, and found that the lower frequency variants had the largest effects, supporting the rare variants hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
while much work remains to be done in order to understand the purpose of sleep, this study gives us some insight as to how genetic variation for sleep might be maintained. a number of genes for sleep have been previously identified by random mutagenesis screens in drosophila. these studies have revealed genes important to sleep. however, these genes may be invariant in natural populations if, for instance, they are under strong purifying selection; if this is the case, they will not contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in sleep. this study found that  <dig> of the genes already known to affect sleep in drosophila affect genetic variation in a natural population as well . the gene ontology analysis suggests that genes impacting sleep fall into very broad categories such as nervous system development and signal transduction. further, genes in the egfr signaling pathway were over-represented in this study, suggesting that polymorphisms in their component genes impact genetic variation in sleep. the egfr pathway is a primary signaling cascade with multiple effects in the regulation of cell fate determination and morphogenesis and affects many downstream biological processes
 <cit> , implying that sleep is connected to many biological processes. the network derived from the snp associations presents a working hypothesis for how polymorphic variants for sleep might interact. note that many of the snps we identified herein are found in novel, computationally predicted genes having functions hypothesized on the basis of homology to genes in other species. a go analysis using only the  <dig> computationally predicted genes from this study reveals additional pathways important for sleep. for example, most of the predicted genes are integral to the membrane, and many are predicted to catalyze the transport of substances from one side of the membrane to the other or to have a function in proteolysis.

a major challenge in human gwa studies is the inability to directly demonstrate that a candidate snp causes the phenotypic variation. drosophila, however, can be manipulated with transgenic approaches, crosses between different genotypes, and artificial selection procedures. this ability will enable us to determine whether the snps we identified herein are causal, whether the same snps have a role in sleep in different populations of drosophila, whether epistatic interactions occur between snps, and the nature of the selective forces acting on sleep. finally, this work forms the basis of a systems genetics analysis that will link polymorphic, molecular, and phenotypic variation for sleep in multiple environments.
