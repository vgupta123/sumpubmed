BACKGROUND
schmallenberg virus , which emerged recently in europe, causes subclinical or mild disease in adult ruminants with clinical signs including diarrhoea, fever and drop in milk yield in dairy cattle. however, infection of pregnant animals during a critical period of pregnancy can cause fetal deformities and may result in loss of the fetus or unviable offspring  <cit> . the first indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  to detect sbv-specific antibodies in serum or milk samples became commercially available shortly after the emergence of sbv  <cit> . testing of bulk tank milk samples by elisa has been advocated as a convenient way to determine herd-level exposure to sbv  <cit> . with the availability of vaccines against sbv, it has become important to know the value of test results for informing herd management decisions; for example, whether a positive bulk tank milk sample result means that herd-level vaccination is not necessary as natural immunity is present.

since its emergence, sbv has spread rapidly across europe and high levels of seroprevalence in cattle have been reported . however, studies have also demonstrated that within-herd seroprevalence is variable. in addition to regional variation in seroprevalence, higher rates have been reported for herds that graze outdoors compared to herds that are housed indoors  <cit> . furthermore, in one study, a bulk tank milk sample tested positive although only 25% of serum samples from individual animals within the herd were positive for antibodies to sbv  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between antibody levels detected in bulk tank milk and individual milk and serum samples from sbv-exposed cows in two herds using a commercially-available elisa, with a serum neutralisation test as a reference.

methods
blood and milk samples were collected from holstein-friesian dairy cows in two herds  on 2nd october  <dig>  a bulk tank milk sample was also obtained from each herd. none of the cows had been vaccinated against sbv. all were clinically healthy at the time of sampling, but clinical signs suggestive of sbv infection  had been observed around one month prior to sampling in herd b. all samples were stored at -20°c until tested. the study was approved by the school of veterinary medicine and science’s ethical review committee.

the presence of immunoglobulin g antibodies to sbv in milk and serum samples was determined using a commercially available indirect elisa  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. as per the manufacturer’s instructions, the percent positivity  relative to the positive control serum supplied was calculated with a pp of ≥10% considered positive for serum samples and ≥8% for milk samples. neutralization tests  were performed on serum samples as previously described  <cit>  using sbv strain bh80/11- <dig>  with the minor modification that cells were fixed in 100% ethanol for 30 minutes then stained for 30 minutes with  <dig> % v/v methylene blue in water. the cut-off value for a positive result was set at a titre of 1: <dig>  milk samples could only be tested by elisa as milk is toxic to the cells used in the nt.

positive predictive  and negative predictive  values were calculated for the elisa using the serum nt as a reference. elisa results with milk or serum were classified as true positive  or true negative  if in agreement with the serum nt. if results differed from the serum nt, they were classified as false positive  or false negative . positive predictive value was calculated as tp/ and negative predictive value as tn/ and expressed as a percentage.

two-sample and paired t-tests as appropriate  were performed using minitab version  <dig>  bland-altman analysis  was performed using graphpad prism v <dig> 

RESULTS
the bulk tank milk sample from herd a had an antibody level of 58% and from herd b 73%. although the elisa is only semi-quantitative, the mean of the individual milk sample values was consistent with the bulk tank milk sample values. a significantly lower  mean antibody level was obtained for individual milk samples from herd a  than for herd b . similarly, in a larger published study of bovine viral diarrhoea virus in which milk samples were tested for antibodies, individual milk and bulk tank milk results correlated well  <cit> . thus, bulk tank milk testing might indicate the presence of individuals within a herd with lower antibody levels , but provides no information as to which  individuals are at potential risk of infection.

in the analysis of samples from individual animals, six cows tested negative in the serum nt . milk and serum samples from one of these cows also tested negative by elisa. the other five animals all tested positive by serum elisa  whereas only two of them tested positive by milk elisa . thus, the positive predictive values were 98% and 94% for the milk and serum elisa, respectively and the negative predictive value for the milk elisa was 100% but for the serum elisa was 50%. thus the serum elisa was more likely to give both false positive and false negative results. the values obtained in the serum elisa for the five ‘false positive’ samples were all at or just above the lower cut-off value of 10% . both the positive and the negative predictive values will be influenced by the high prevalence of sbv antibodies in the animals tested; in a high prevalence setting such as this, it is more likely that animals that test positive truly have antibodies to sbv and, conversely, that the negative predictive value is decreased  <cit> .table  <dig>

the antibody levels measured in milk samples were significantly  higher  than in serum samples . this is in contrast to other studies comparing antibody levels against bovine coronavirus and/or bovine respiratory syncytial virus in matched serum and milk samples, which found good agreement but generally lower antibody levels in milk compared to serum samples  <cit> . the distribution of the measured pp values is shown in figure 1a. bland-altman analysis revealed a bias of - <dig> . differences between the milk and serum elisa results were more apparent at mean pp values for the two tests of greater than 50% .figure  <dig>

protective antibody levels have not been defined for sbv and the indirect elisa is at best only semi-quantitative. therefore, if individual testing were conducted in order to inform management decisions such as whether to vaccinate potentially susceptible animals, the cut-off for deciding to vaccinate would be a discretionary one. a negative result in the serum or milk elisa would clearly indicate a susceptible individual. however, pp values near the assay cut-off should be treated with caution, particularly for the serum elisa.

as testing a bulk tank milk sample may not provide an accurate reflection of the proportion of a herd that has antibodies, and milk samples can be obtained non-invasively, individual testing of a number of animals can provide an indication of the need to vaccinate the whole herd. however, testing using the currently available indirect elisas would, in most cases, be prohibitively expensive. therefore, if informed decisions are to be made whether or not to vaccinate a dairy herd, a cheaper alternative pen-side test to detect antibodies in individual milk and/or serum samples is required.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study suggest that testing of either serum or milk samples from individuals rather than bulk tank milk testing is necessary to identify whether animals within a dairy herd are potentially susceptible to sbv infection.
