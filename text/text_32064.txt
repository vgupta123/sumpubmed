BACKGROUND
the neural cell adhesion molecule  is an archetypal member of the family of ig-domain containing adhesion molecules  <cit> . ncam is involved in a number of cell interactions between neurons, neurons and glial cells, neuronal processes and muscle cells, and certain immune cells  <cit> . a unique feature of ncam is the existence in two glycoforms, which, due to their prominence in either embryonic or adult tissue, were denominated embryonic- and adult-ncam  <cit> . the difference between the two protein forms is the regiospecific addition of polysia onto two n-glycans located in 5th ig-like domain in embryonic-ncam  <cit> . polysia is a homopolymer of the acidic nonasugar sialic acid  with roughly  <dig> monomers linked alpha- <dig> -glycosidically  <cit> . presence of polysia on ncam has been demonstrated to invert the adhesive functions of the molecule into functions that promote cellular motility and plasticity  <cit> . importantly, parts of the plasticity promoting functions of the polysia decorated ncam  attribute the size and negative charge of the polysia shell, which prevents tight cellular interactions and thus globally impedes adhesion processes as well as ncam dependent cell interactions  <cit> . with the maturation of tissue  polysia expression is progressively down regulated and in adulthood has virtually disappeared from peripheral tissues and is detected mainly in different regions of the nervous system  <cit> . polysialylation of ncam is mediated by two golgi-resident enzymes, the polysialyltransferases  st8siaii  <cit>  and st8siaiv  <cit> , exhibiting overlapping but distinct expression patterns. each individual enzyme is able to synthesize polysia on ncam  <cit> . thus, selective knockout of only one polyst gene is not sufficient to fully abrogate polysia synthesis in settings where both enzymes are expressed.

polysia-ncam and tumor development
besides its function in development polysia-ncam represents a marker in a number of neuroectodermal and neuroendocrine tumors  <cit> . in polysia-ncam positive tumors the carbohydrate has been demonstrated to positively impact tumor growth  and metastasis . endosialidases are phage born enzymes that recognize and degrade polysia with pronounced specificity  <cit> . to study the role of polysia during tumor progression, knockdown experiments have been carried out in which polysia specific endosialidase were injected  <cit> . however, endosialidases are large enzymes with restricted penetration into tumor nodules  <cit>  and systemic application of these kinetically stabilized enzymes  may be followed by long term complications that based on current research cannot be calculated. taken together, it can be stated, that endosialidases, though attractive, are far away from clinical application. to bypass these limitations and to avoid off-target effects we demonstrate in this study that polysia synthesis can be knocked down by means of intrabody technology.


intracellular antibodies  are very potent molecules for long lasting specific knockdown of proteins. the advantages of ibs are high specificity, the possibility to inhibit post translational modifications  <cit> , and the chance to generate transgenic intrabody mouse models . new methods like crispr/cas <dig> or talen will be further developed and support the generation of transgenic mice. moreover, ibs have been proven very useful in cases where the most often used gene-silencing method rnai produced off target effects  <cit> .

ibs are antibody fragments containing the antigen binding domains, typically in single-chain variable fragment  format or single domain format. ibs can be targeted to the cytosol, the nucleus, or the er. targeting ibs to the er has proven to be most promising, because er-resident chaperones and disulfide isomerases ensure correct folding and the formation of essential disulfide bridges, respectively. due to the lack of these factors in the cytoplasm, ibs in the scfv format were found to be not stable in this compartment  <cit> . however, a number of techniques has been developed to select functional cytosolic scfv’s  <cit> . most successful is the expression of single domain antibodies  <cit> . indeed, today the number of cytosolic single domain antibodies is similar to the number of specific er-ibs.

er-ibs can be generated from in vitro display systems  <cit>  or by starting from a hybridoma clone  <cit> . protein knockdown mediated by er-ib is based on retention of the formed antigen-antibody complex inside the er via the er-retention sequence kdel fused to the c-terminus of the intrabody  <cit> . so far, er-ibs have been elicited mostly against cell surface  <cit>  and two secretory proteins  <cit> . the technology is, however, also applicable to intracellular proteins as demonstrated by two recent studies, which generated functional knockdowns of tlr <dig> and sec <dig> by preventing their recruitment to endosomes by intrabody-mediated retention in the er  <cit> .

here we describe the generation of two er-ibs against the golgi-localized polysts, st8siaii and st8siaiv. the newly generated ibs impeded the cellular polysialylation machinery resulting in reduced polysia-ncam levels in rhamdyomasarcoma tumor cells. in a xenograft mouse model the metastatic potential of the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line te <dig>  which due to the expression of both polysts is highly positive for polysia-ncam, could be significantly reduced. combined application of both er ibs resulted in a clear delay in metastasis. this highlights the efficacy of er ibs as novel tools to interfere with golgi localized glycosyltransferases and to study the impact of aberrant glycosylation in cancer biology.

RESULTS
construction and expression of ibs against the polysialyltransferases st8siaii and st8siaiv
er ibs against the polysts st8siaii and –iv  were generated on the basis of the variable domains of the monoclonal antibodies   <dig> and  <dig>  which are directed against st8siaii and st8siaiv, respectively. the corresponding dna sequences were amplified by rt-pcr on mrna isolated from the respective hybridoma clones. the sequence stretches encoding the variable regions of heavy  and light chain  encompassed 351 bp and 353 bp for αst8siaii-ib and 363 bp and 353 bp for αst8siaiv-ib. the dna fragments encoding vh and vl were connected through the sequence stretch  <dig>  the resulting scfv constructs comprised 749 bp for αst8siaii-ib and 761 bp for αst8siaiv-ib . cloning into the vector pcmv/myc/er resulted in plasmids that encoded scfv’s with an n-terminal signal peptide and a c-terminal myc-tag followed by an er retention signal . notably, the original sequences encoding the variable domains were obtained by a method based on pcr amplification of adaptor ligated cdna  <cit> . therefore an adaptor sequence is ligated to double stranded cdna’s of both antibodies.fig.  <dig> assembly and expression of er ibs recognizing st8siaii and st8siaiv. a pcr amplification of the variable domains vh and vl of anti-st8siaii and anti-st8siaiiv scfv fragments  and assembly of the corresponding scfvs . 20 μl of the pcr products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel . b primary sequence of anti-st8siaii and anti-st8siaiv intrabody. shown are the coding  and amino acid sequence  of anti-st8siaii-ib and anti-st8siaiv-ib including the er signal peptide, the myc epitope and the er retention sequence. the complementary-determing regions  of the variable domains of the heavy and light chain are printed in blue letters. the synthetic linker, shown in red letters, localized between the vh and vl domains was introduced by assembly pcr. c immunofluorescence analysis by microscopy of permeabilized and fixed hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with ibs. intracellular expression was stained in red. positive control: anti-tlr <dig> ib, negative control: hek  <dig> cells transiently transfected with the empty expression plasmid pcmv/myc/er. d immunoblot analysis, expression of anti-st8siaii-ib and anti-st8siaiv-ib visualized with peroxidase labelled secondary antibody. sample volume: 10 μl of 100 μl cell lysat from  <dig> cells transiently transfected for 48 h with the intrabody dna in a 6-well microtiter plate




subsequent pcr with primers binding to the beginning of the adapter sequence and the constant domain of igg <dig> respectively leads to amplification of the adaptor, leader, variable domain and part of the constant igg <dig> domain. this technique delivers the correct sequences and prevents mismatches which might occur if the variable domains are amplified by consensus primers  <cit> . interestingly, the sequence of the cdr3h region of st8siaii-ib is very short comprising only  <dig> amino acids.

after transient transfection of hek <dig> cells, expression of ibs was demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining  and western blot analysis with the anti-myc mab 9e <dig> . immunoblotting revealed an apparent molecular mass of approximately 30 kda, which is characteristic for er-ibs in the scfv format   <cit> .

binding of ibs to polysialyltransferases st8siaii and st8siaiv
to confirm that the newly generated er ibs maintained the antigen binding activity of the original mabs, we performed an elisa. immobilized flag-ha tagged st8siaii and st8siaiv were incubated with the original mabs  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as with serial dilutions of cell lysates from hek <dig> cells, which had been transiently transfected with either one of the intrabody expression plasmids or with empty vector . . compared to cell lysates from empty vector transfected hek <dig> cells, significant antigen binding was detected for intrabody containing hek <dig> lysates. consistent with this, the formation of intracellular intrabody-antigen complexes was demonstrated  by co-immunoprecipitation. therefore, hek <dig> cells were co-transfected with plasmids driving the expression of the respective flag-ha-tagged polyst and the corresponding myc-tagged intrabody. interaction was demonstrated by capturing the ibs via their c-terminal myc-epitope. an efficient co-immunoprecipitation of the respective polysts was demonstrated by western blot analysis with anti-flag antibody . co-immunoprecipitation resulted in the same band pattern as direct immunoprecipitation of the enzymes by an anti-flag antibody . as shown earlier, st8siaii and st8siaiv contain several n-glycosylation sites and in addition to the fully glycosylated variants with apparent molecular masses of 60 kda and 55 kda, respectively, glycoforms with fewer n-glycans and increased electrophoretic mobility were found  <cit> .fig.  <dig> binding of anti-st8siaii-ib and anti-st8siaiv-ib to their antigens in elisa. a 50 ng purified st8siaii and st8siaiv in 50 μl  <dig>  m sodium phosphate puffer was immobilized on maxisorb™ polystyrene assay plates  as indicated. serial dilutions of purified original anti-st8siaii and anti-st8siaiv mabs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were applied in 100 μl pbs. negative control: st8siaiv incubated with anti-myc antibody. b serial dilutions of 100 μl cell lysates of  <dig> hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with anti-st8siaii-ib expression plasmid or anti-st8siaiv-ib expression plasmid for 48 h in a  <dig> well microtiter plate were incubated in different serial dilutions in 100 μl pbs with immobilized purified st8siaii or st8siaiv. negative controls: cell lysates transfected with pcmv/myc/er. result of  <dig> independent experiments. bars demonstrate standard deviation calculated from the mean values

αst8siaii-ib and αst8siaiv-ib mediate er-retention of the corresponding polysialyltransferase
to investigate if anti-polyst ibs provoke er-retention of their cognate polyst, we analyzed the subcellular localization of polysts in the presence and absence of the ibs. for this approach, we made use of stably transfected cho cells derived from the polyst-deficient mutant 2a <dig>  <cit> . clone cho-2a10 +  <dig> stably expresses flag-ha-tagged st8siaii and clone cho-2a10 +  <dig> flag-ha-tagged st8siaiv  <cit> . both cell lines were transiently transfected with each of the intrabody expression plasmids  and the expressed ibs and polysts were visualized by immunofluorescence analysis.

co-localization of the ibs with the er marker calnexin verified the presence of the ibs in the er . in the absence of ibs, the anti-flag signals  clearly co-localized with the golgi marker α-mannosidase ii and thus indicated golgi localization of polysts . however, upon intrabody expression, the targeted polysts co-localized with the intrabody in the er, thus indicating efficient er retention . of importance, expression of αst8siaii-ib affected the localization of st8siaii  but not of st8siaiv . vice versa, expression of αst8siaiv-ib resulted in er-retention of st8siaiv  but not of st8siaii , underlining the specificity of the ibs.fig.  <dig> anti-st8siaii-ib and anti-st8siaiv-ib mediates retention of st8siaii and st8siaiv inside the er.  <dig> recombinant cho cells transiently transfected for 48 h with the corresponding intrabody dna or unspecific intrabody dna in a 6-well microtiter plate were analyzed by immunofluorescence. a colocalisation of ibs with er marker calnexin. recombinant cho cells expressing st8siaii  were transfected with anti-st8siaii-ib expression plasmid  or cho cells expressing st8siaiv  were transfected with anti-st8siaiv-ib expression plasmid . er resident marker calnexin was stained red. ibs were labelled green. b colocalisation of st8siaii and st8siaiv in non transfected cho-2a 10 +  <dig> cells  and in non transfected cho-2a10 +  <dig> cells  with golgi marker α-mannose ii. golgi marker α-mannose ii was stained red. polysialyltransferases were labeled green. c st8siaii and anti-st8siaii-ib or st8siaiv and anti-st8siaiv-ib were stained in anti-st8siaii-ib or st8siaiv-ib transfected cho-2a10 +  <dig> cells or cho-2a10 +  <dig> cells. in this case the polysialyltransferases were stained red d negative controls: staining of the polysialyltransferases and ibs in the cho cells transfected with the unspecific ibs. the experiment was done  <dig> times. shown is a characteristic staining




expression of αst8siaii-ib and αst8siaiv-ib reduces polysia expression in cho cells
to monitor the functional consequences of intrabody-mediated er-retention of polysts, the polysia levels were monitored in cho-2a10 +  <dig>  and cho-2a10 +  <dig> cells  before and after transient expression of the respective intrabody. as known from previous studies, the polyst transformed 2a <dig> cell lines express the two major ncam isoforms ncam- <dig> and ncam- <dig> but polysialylation of ncam isoforms is incomplete in these cells  <cit> . in keeping with this information, the anti-polysia mab  <dig> revealed in both cell lines a broad microheterogenous polysia-ncam signal centering at an apparent molecular mass of 250 kda, while staining with mab h <dig>  specifically recognizing a protein epitope on ncam, displayed two focused bands that represented polysia-free ncam- <dig> and − <dig> . applying these antibodies to intrabody expressing cells, demonstrated a significant decrease in the polysia signal while the ncam signals remained unchanged. based on these results it can be stated that the er-ibs directed against st8siaii- and iv are efficient in knocking down the polysia production on ncam while the ncam protein itself remained untouched.fig.  <dig> reduced expression of polysia in recombinant cho cells mediated by anti-st8siaii and anti-st8siaiv ibs. a immunoblot analysis of expressed ncam and polysia of ncam in cho-2a10 + 500-cells expressing st8siaii transfected with st8siaii-ib. negative control: cells non transfected or transfected with pcmv/myc/er. positive control: cell lysat treated with endosialidase. b immunoblot analysis of expressed ncam and polysia of ncam in cho-2a10 + 418-cells expressing st8siaiv transfected with st8siaiv ib. the experiment was done  <dig> times. shown is a characteristic example. sample volume: 10 μl of 100 μl cell lysat from  <dig> cells grown for 48 h in a 6-well microtiter plate

high polysia expression in the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line te <dig> is due to the expression of both polysts  <cit> . interrogating if combined application of the newly generated anti-polyst ibs can reduce polysia expression rhabdomyosarcoma cells were double transfected with plasmids driving the expression of αst8siaii-ib and αst8siaiv-ib. as it was our goal to use transformants also in in vivo experiments , stable intrabody-expressing cell lines were generated that simultaneously expressed luciferase as a reporter protein. moreover, for control reasons we also generated an ncam-knockdown variant in te <dig> by use of the previously described αncam-ib plasmid  <cit> . three stably transfected te <dig> clones were selected.  te671-polysts-luc: te <dig> cells expressing αst8siaii-ib, αst8siaiv-ib and luciferase.  te671-ncam-luc: te <dig> cells expressing α-ncam-ib and luciferase.  te671-control: te <dig> cells expressing luciferase and transfected with the empty vector pcmvmycer. all clones were analyzed for proliferation, intrabody expression and intrabody functionality. identical proliferation rates were measured under standard cell culture conditions  and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated comparable expression levels of the two anti-polyst ibs . after 14 days in culture, flow cytometric was used to analyze polysia levels in αst8siaii-ib/αst8siaiv-ib expressing te <dig> cells. as shown in fig. 6c a significant reduction in the cell surface expression of polysia was found but not of ncam . as expected, application of the αncam-ib most efficiently downregulated ncam as well as polysia surface expression. by contrast, cell surface expression of ncam and polysia were unaltered in the mock transfected control cell line .fig.  <dig> polysia cell surface expression is inhibited in te <dig> rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressing α st <dig> sia ii and α st <dig> sia iv intrabody. a proliferation assay of  <dig> x  <dig> te <dig> cells stable expressing αst8siaii-ib and αst8siaiv-ib, anti-ncam ib or empty vector cultured in wells of a 6-well microtiter plate over a time period of 8 days. the number of living cells was determined after staining with trypan blue using a rosenthal-fuchs counting chamber. starting material was  <dig> ×  <dig> cells. the proliferation assay was done  <dig> times, bars demonstrate standard deviation calculated from the mean values. b immunofluorescence analysis of anti-st8siaii-ib, anti-st8siaiv-ib and anti-ncam intrabody expression.  <dig> recombinant cho cells transiently transfected for 48 h with the anti-polysts intrabodies or anti-ncam intrabody in a 6-well microtiter plate were analyzed by immunofluorescence. anti-st8siaii, anti-st8siaiv-ib and anti-ncam intrabody were detected in red. c flow cytometric detection of polysia and ncam cell surface expression. stable transfected cell lines are shown with red lines. negative controls are non-transfected cells  and cells only incubated with the secondary antibody . in the case of detection of polysia negative controls are cells treated with endosialidase .  <dig> cells in 300 μl pbs containing 2% fcs and 10 μg/ml propidiumiodide were measured. the flow cytometric analysis was performed  <dig> times. shown is characteristic cell surface staining of ncam and polysia from one experiment

discussion
polysia is a developmentally regulated posttranslational modification predominantly found on ncam  <cit> . as a regulator of ncam  <cit>  interactions, polysia is essential for postnatal development and brain wiring  <cit> . moreover, polysia represents an oncofetal antigen, which is widely expressed in fetal but not in adult tissues and commonly re-expressed on tumors of neuroectodermal and neuroendocrine origin such as small cell lung carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma . polysia-positive tumor cells typically express st8siaii and st8siaiv  <cit>  and therefore to block polysia synthesis, inhibition of the two enzymes is required to ablate polysialylation.

to overcome problems that might arise from off-target effects and to generate molecules for specific knockdown of each enzyme we selected the intrabody approach. for inhibition of the function of transitory molecules ibs are targeted to the er where they bind to their antigens very specifically  <cit> . consequently, the translocation of the antigen to the final cell compartment is blocked. the ib technology has been successfully used to knockdown targets in vitro and in vivo . a recent example of the exquisite specificity of ibs has been provided by the use of anti-tlr ibs  <cit> . in the current study, anti-polyst ibs were constructed from the variable domains of two monoclonal antibodies .

analyzing the function of st8siaii-ib and st8siaiv-ib using immunoblot analysis  demonstrated efficient knockdown for each enzyme. the inhibition of polysialylation mediated by the ibs is due to intrabody-polyst complex formation inside the er. the fact, that polysts do not reach the golgi apparatus prevents the enzymes from gaining access to their substrates cmp-sialic acid and ncam with fully processed n-glycans . although costaining of the ib with the er marker calnexin  and the antigens  confirmed er retention, the signal displayed by calnexin was much more coarse and discontinuous than the signal obtained if ibs were displayed with anti-myc antibody and polyst with anti-flag antibody. however, this effect is known and has similarly been observed with anti-tlr <dig> ibs  <cit> .

importantly, the efficiency of the ibs to modulate the metastatic potential of a rhabdomyosarcoma xenograft  was investigated in a mouse model. in this study tumor cells stably expressing both anti-polyst ibs were used in comparison to control cells and to cells expressing the recently generated anti-ncam ib. although the inhibition of ncam-polysialylation was not complete in te <dig> cells transformed with anti-polyst ibs, the knockdown was sufficient to significantly delay tumor spread . after 6 weeks no inhibitory effect of the ibs could be seen anymore and metastasis was similar as seen with the control tumor cells . the inhibition of metastasis was not complete mainly due to the fact that the knockdown of polysialylation in te <dig> cells was not complete. furthermore it cannot be excluded that tumor cells with integrated ib genes have loss the ib genes after 6 weeks and may overgrow the stable ib expressing cells. this indicates that more experimental work is needed to achieve a complete polysia depletion. a combination of endo-n treatment with intrabody expression might further reduce polysialylation.

it is known that many factors are involved in metastasis such as lost of cadherin or integrin  <cit>  and cell migration-promoting chemokines. pro-metastatic factors activate specific, corresponding types of receptors  <cit> . our targets were the polysts and we cannot exclude that metastasis is enhanced after 4 weeks due to other molecules affecting metastasis not targeted by our specific intrabodies.

other reasons might also be taken into account. one possibility is that polysts bind to ncam inside the er and this interaction interferes with intrabody binding. to interrogate this possibility we performed an elisa based test. immobilized ncam was preincubated with the polysts, which were then detected with the ibs. in this test system we did not recognize inhibition of ib-binding to the polysts .

eventually, one has to bear in mind that the developed ibs target enzymes. since ibs generally knockdown antigens it might well be that low amounts of the active enzymes  reach the golgi and are sufficient to produce significant amounts of polysia-ncam.

in a similar metastatic mouse model daniel et al.  <cit>  injected te <dig> cells intraperitoneally and removed polysia by co-injection with endo-n. analogous to our study ascites formation was decreased and the number of lung or liver metastases reduced. also in this earlier study the failure to completely block tumor formation was explained by incomplete removal of polysia from tumor cells.

er intrabodies comprising the c-terminal kdel retention sequence have been successfully used to inhibit the function of transitory protein. inhibition was in the range from 50% to 100%  <cit> . the kdel sequence leads to retrograde transport from different subcellular golgi compartments. transitory proteins can be recycled from an intermediate compartment before the protein has reached the golgi-complex, from the cis golgi compartment and even from the trans-golgi compartment  <cit> . recently it was shown that a chimeric sialyltransferase  with a rapamycin binding domain  binding to fkbp  protein containing a c-terminal kdel sequence lead to retrograde transport from the golgi to the er  <cit> . from which golgi compartment st was recycled was not estimated.

retrievel from an early golgi complex location was easily shown by golgi-specific modifications of the n- or 0-linked carbohydrate side chains of transitory proteins  <cit> . in fig.  <dig> it is clearly shown that in the presence of the specific intrabody the enzyme are found exclusively in the er and not inside the golgi network. however this is only one time point within the retention process.

transferring polysia to ncam by st8siaii and st8sia iv occurs in the trans golgi  <cit> . however we cannot exclude that the enzyme intrabody complexes are recycled from the trans golgi and binds to ncam. if the antibody inhibits binding of the enzyme to ncam or inactivates the enzyme so that polysialylation cannot occur is not clear. another possibility that intrabody inhibition is not complete might be that the affinities of the original anti-polysts are not high enough for complete retention of the antigens inside the er, although we were not able to identify polysts in the golgi compartment in ib expressing cells .

to compare the knockdown of st8siaii and st8siaiv mediated by the anti-polysts ibs with the knockdown of complete ncam-polysia we injected tumor cells expressing an anti-ncam intrabody established recently by us  <cit> . we wanted to analyse if abrogation of ncam-polysia at the cell surface would lead to metastasis even if integrins and cadherins and the cadherin associated proteins are not abrogated.

we expected that abrogation of ncam-polysia on the tumor cell surface would led to metastasis of the cells. indeed, tumor cells expressing the anti-ncam intrabody showed metastatic behavior similar as the control tumor cells. this confirms the published data that abolished ncam on the surface of tumor cells promotes metastasis  <cit> . recently it was found that other cell surface proteins as ncam can be polysialylated  . from these proteins ccr <dig> is expressed on rhabdomyosarcoma cells and is involved in lymph node metastasis  <cit>  we cannot conclude if inhibition of polysialylation of ccr <dig> by the ibs have also contributed to the delay of metastasis.

alternatively to the ib approach, a knockout of polysts can be performed with the crispr/cas <dig> technology . recently this approach has been used to show that st8siavi-dependent cell surface polysialylation is essential for endoderm specification  <cit> . in regard to the crispr/cas <dig> technology one advantage of the intrabody technology is that the intrabodies can be transfected by viral gene transfer in almost every cell line. on the contrary if one intend to study the function of the polysts in different cell types new knockout cell lines using crispr/cas <dig> have to be generated. furthermore in contrast to the crispr/cas <dig> technology which often showed off targets effects, such effects have not been seen so far with intrabodies  <cit> .

at the moment the number of er ibs as well as cytosolic nanobodies is increasing. they are very useful to study the function of proteins in vitro and in vivo. beyond some ibs have been shown to have therapeutic potential. among the most promising candidates are those that impact viral infections, brain diseases and cancer  <cit> . the successful therapeutic application of ibs depends on the development of safe viral vectors and nonviral vectors with high gene transfer efficiency. current viral vectors for gene therapy are associated with serious safety concerns including insertional mutagenesis  <cit>  and usage of nonviral vectors is limited by low gene transfer efficiency  <cit> . furthermore tissue-specific transfer of intrabody genes and therapeutic transgenes in general is important for safe and effective gene therapy. many viral vectors are not specific for one cell type. by transductional targeting cell-type specific engineered viruses can be transduced specifically  <cit> . this includes engineering of adaptor proteins containing the targeting ligands, monoclonal antibodies or bispecific antibodies into the virus envelope or changing of the serotype  <cit> . another method is transcriptional targeting based on expression of the transgene via tissue-specific promoters  <cit> . this method is limited by the small number of strong tissue specific promoters. a third approach based on microrna-regulated viral vectors has been developed  <cit> . here artificial microrna target sites are incorporated into the viral vector serving as targets for a specific microrna leading to transcript degradation. this technique has the potential to be translated into clinical applications. furthermore conferring to non viral transfections nanoparticles decorated with cell surface receptor specific nanobodies are working in many examples in vitro and will now start to be tested in vivo  <cit> .

in the future a promising alternative approach might be the application of mrna  <cit> . furthermore it might be possible to combine the intrabody strategy with other strategies which aim to inhibit the function of the polysts in cancer cells  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge this is the first description of er ibs  that knockdown golgi-located enzymes in vitro and in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
the data indicate that the new ibs are potent tools to study the individual role of each enzyme in cell migration and tumor progression of different tumors. in addition they can be used to get more insight into the role of st8siaii and st8siaiv on the polysialylation of targets different from ncam  .
