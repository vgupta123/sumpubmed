BACKGROUND
clustering of biological data often requires to look for the proximity of few data points within a large dataset with the purpose to group together only those that satisfy the same set of constraints, possibly resulting from the same functional origins, or that have undergone the same evolutionary pressures. this is the case for amino acids in proteins, where one expects few of the residues to account for the structural stability of the protein or for its functional activity. for these biological problems, the number of expected clusters is unknown and classification approaches, known as unsupervised, are expected to unravel hidden structures in the data.

a common approach to clustering is the simple unsupervised k-means clustering technique  <cit> . it starts with a random selection of k samples in the dataset and iteratively creates clusters of data points around the k samples by adding new data points to the k-centers in such a way that the sum of squared errors between data points and their nearest centers is small. k-means clustering is sensitive to the initial selection of data points and it needs to be re-run many times in the attempt to find a satisfiable solution. if k is small and there are good chances that at least one random selection of data points will be close to a good solution, k-means is an interesting technique to try. otherwise, the ideal approach would be to simultaneously consider all data points in the set and find, with some well-designed criteria, appropriate candidates for cluster generation  <cit> . we propose a method that tries all data points, that is multidimensional vectors of characters, as generators and extends them by properly identifying data points in the set that share with the generator similar values for the same set of characters and display differences on a complementary set of characters. through an appropriate discretization of the space of distances, the method always provides a clustering solution and this latter is unique. depending on the strength of the clusters, measured by the number of similar characters, the method aggregates clusters whenever they share some data points. aggregates are expected to be biologically significant.

clag, for clusters aggregation, is an unsupervised non hierarchical clustering algorithm that handles non uniform distributions of values in order to zoom in dense sets of character values, parameterizes data points proximity, and outputs a graph of similarity between data points as well as a clustered matrix.

important work on clustering a restricted number of datapoints  <cit>  or datapoints that might belong to several clusters  <cit>  has been previously developed. clag is compared to several known clustering methods, as hierarchical agglomerative clustering and k-means, and in particular to fuzzy c-means, model-based clustering and affinity propagation clustering. it proves to be informative and accurate, not to suffer of convergence problems proper to some of the methods, and to perform well with multidimensional data.

RESULTS
clustering algorithm and aggregation
let us consider a set n of n elements and a set e, called environment, of m characters. to each element we associate a vector of m character values, and we consider a m × n matrix a describing the full set of elements in n. characters can have different nature or might be the n elements themselves. in this latter case, the matrix entries might correspond to correlation values or to distances between elements. without loss of generality, we assume the matrix entries to be reals and we renormalize them in the interval  <cit> . let Δ
be a parameter, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  that modulates the proximity between elements. based on Δ, we shall determine if two elements v,z∈n are close  with respect to the environment and, whenever possible, if they are symmetric. the idea is to look at the distribution of matrix entries and analyse for each pair of elements in n  the localization of all corresponding pairs of matrix entries within the distribution. a measure of closeness between entries is introduced  and it is used to define the proximity of two elements in n. then, we define two scores, environmental and symmetric scores, for pairs of elements in n providing, in this way, a numerical criteria to evaluate clusters’ strength.

entries distributions and grids
the m·n
entries of the matrix are first analyzed by looking at their distribution and dividing it into Δ-quantiles , that is subsets of the distribution containing 100·Δ% of entries. we denote with Δ-quantile, the Δ-quantile computed starting at entry s of the distribution. to each Δ-quantile, we associate an interval which is defined by the minimum 
s1
and the maximum s <dig> entries within the Δ-quantile. the length of the interval is |s2 − s1|.

we discretize the entries distribution with the help of two shifted grids of intervals that will be used to easily define entries closeness. namely, a 0-grid is defined by segmenting the distribution in Δ-quantiles from the minimal entry of the distribution, and a 1-grid is defined by segmenting the distribution from the end of the first Δ2-quantile. the successive intervals of the 0-grid are denoted ii <dig>  and those for the 1-grid are denoted ii <dig>  notice that the first and the last intervals of the 1-grid correspond to Δ2-quantiles. see figure 1a for an example of distribution and grids.

and this implies an environmental score senv =  <dig>  c: contrary to b, here the  <dig> pairs of entries, a
and a, are not necessarily equal nor highly similar  and they are indicated by a straight line linking entries positions.
senv
is expected not to be maximal.

we say that a distribution of scores is heterogeneous in a grid if there are intervals of the grid whose lengths are greater than μ + σ, where μ is the mean of the lengths of the intervals for the entire grid and σ
is the standard deviation of the distribution of lengths. to avoid having very large and very small intervals associated to Δ-quantiles for the same distribution, possibly due to very sparse or very concentrated entries along the distribution, we refine the 0- and 1-grids by cutting in half each interval in them which is larger than μ + σ and redefine the 0- and 1-grids to be the refined ones.

closeness between entries
clag clusters elements in n according to e and to explain how it does it, we introduce the notion of closeness between pairs of entries. let s <dig> 
s <dig> be two entries within the matrix such that
s1 < s <dig>  we say that s1
and s <dig> are close in a grid if they belong to the same interval in either the 0- or the 1-grid, or if they belong to two consecutive intervals, that is ii <dig> ii+ <dig> or ii <dig> ii+ <dig>  and s <dig> belongs to Δ-quantile.

notice that for distributions of scores that are not heterogeneous, the definition of closeness can be greatly simplified: two entries s <dig> s <dig>  with
s1 < s <dig>  are close if
s <dig> belongs to the Δ-quantile. for distributions which are possibly heterogeneous, the notion of grid turns out to be crucial but it should be observed that the concept of closeness could be stated by using the 0-grid only. the usage of the second grid  is redundant here.

environmental score
for a pair of elements v,z∈n, we evaluate the closeness of the entries a
and a for each x∈e. we define the environmental scoressenv by counting the number of characters x for which a and a are close, say k, and we set senv=km  = a). the set of characters x which are not close is denoted diff . for convenience, we renormalize the environmental scores senv to the interval . a high environmental score reflects the fact that v,z behave in a highly similar manner for all characters in e , while a low score indicates a very different behavior within e .

clusters and affine clusters
to define a cluster in a matrix, we fix an element v∈n as a cluster’s generator, for a fixed Δ. for each pair of elements v,z∈n, the cluster containing v,z
and generated by v  is the largest set of elements w∈n such that the two following conditions are satisfied:


a. senv = senv,

b. diff = diff.

if no such w  exist, the cluster is formed by the pair v,z.

from the definition, it follows that a cluster is a subset of elements in n that behave similarly with respect to e. it also follows that two clusters generated by the same element might share at most one element, that is the generator. clusters sharing several residues are generated by different elements. notice that for a cluster c, the value senv is the same for all z ∈ c . we call this unique value senv. an affine cluster is a cluster c where
senv >  <dig>  that is a cluster whose elements display identical scores  with at least a half of the environment. strictly speaking, cluster affinity could be defined in more general terms with respect to a hyperparameter δ, by setting
senv > δ.

by increasing Δ, one expects clusters to get larger  and possibly new ones to be created. this parameter renders the system flexible to clustering analysis and adaptable to multiple applications, the idea being that clusters detected by small Δ’s are the most meaningful and that significativity of clusters would decrease by enlarging Δ.

matrices with n⊆e
if n⊆e, then one can define an additional score, called the symmetric scoressym
of pairs of elements v,z∈n, that establishes when a
and a are identical up to Δ
and where they are located along the distribution of entries.

symmetric score
in order to evaluate the symmetric score of a pair v,z∈n, we consider a
and a and check for their closeness.
ssym
is defined for close entries only, and for all other pairs is undefined. with no loss of generality, a < a.

the definition of symmetric score for two close entries a
and a
is given by cases:


 <dig>  if a
and a
belong to in <dig>  we set ssym = ssym = 2·n.

 <dig>  if a
and a
belong to in <dig>  we set ssym = ssym = 2·n +  <dig> 

 <dig>  if a and a belong to the two consecutive intervals in <dig> in+ <dig> and to im <dig> im+ <dig>  and a is in Δ-quantile), then we set


  ssym=ssym=2·nifim1≤in02·m+1ifin0<im <dig> 

where i < j
means that the interval i starts before the interval j.

 <dig>  if a and a belong either to in <dig> in+ <dig> or to im <dig> im+ <dig>  and a is in Δ-quantile), then we set ssym = ssym = 2·n
or 2·m + 1
respectively.

the symmetric score of a pair of elements v,z
describes the approximate position of the Δ-quantile containing both a
and a values in the distribution of entries. this mapping could be stated in different manners and we have chosen to do it with the help of two grids instead of one to obtain a more precise score function. for convenience, we renormalize the symmetric scores to the interval .

clusters and affine clusters taking into account symmetricity
we fix an element v  as a cluster’s generator, for a fixed Δ. for a pair of elements v,z∈n, the cluster containing v,z
and generated by v  is the largest set of elements w∈n such that the three following conditions are satisfied:


a. ssym = ssym,

b. senv = senv,

c. diff = diff.

if no such w  exist, the cluster is formed by the pair v,z.

for a cluster c, there are unique values
senv
and ssym. if senv >  <dig> and ssym > 0
then the cluster is affine. the symmetricity condition  imposes an extra requirement for similarity by enforcing elements in a cluster to behave symmetrically one to the other. the identification of such clusters might be useful in certain applications as illustrated for the dataset of residues in proteins discussed below.

clag algorithm: the clustering step
clag is structured along two steps: a clustering step and a cluster aggregation step . the clustering step takes as input a matrix a and a value Δ, and goes as follows:


 <dig>  it computes environmental scores for all pairs of elements in n . scores are normalized.

 <dig>  it clusters a by following conditions ab  as described above.

 <dig>  it identifies clusters and affine clusters.

 <dig>  it outputs a list of ranked affine clusters with respect to their environmental  scores and other numerical properties, and pdf images of the clustered matrix.
and the scores threshold n . the environmental score is computed differently for real-valued matrices  and binary matrices . for matrices with n⊂e, clag computes the symmetric score too .

notice that the input matrix is automatically renormalized to  <cit> , if the matrix values do not belong to  <cit> 
already. the advantage of using renormalized values, is that they allow the user to visualize affine clusters with the r script developed for this purpose. also, notice that when n⊆e, the algorithm can be executed in two manners: either by allowing the symmetricity condition to hold or not. when the condition is ignored, similarity will be computed for elements v,z∈n such that |a − a| ≥ Δ.

highest is the environmental score, closer is the behavior of the elements grouped in a cluster . this information is helpful to understand the structure of the set n and it could be used to identify elements that group together and those that are shared by several clusters while varying an environmental score threshold.

notice that in the clustering step, the algorithm identifies the set of clusters generated by all elements of n and that there is no selection on generators that might bias clusters identification.

the cluster aggregation step
clusters might share common elements and we wish to derive non overlapping sets of elements while keeping track of elements proximity. we do so for affine clusters and, possibly, for clusters with scores greater than a fixed positive threshold. we iteratively aggregate clusters in a graph as follows:


 <dig>  for any n clusters in the list, say
c <dig> c2…cn, having the same  environmental score, iteratively fuse together those clusters that share a common element and associate to the resulting cluster the same  environmental score. apply this step until no more clusters can be fused together. rank the list of resulting clusters with the  highest environmental score.

 <dig>  remove two clusters c <dig> 
c2
from the top of the ranked list; if c <dig> c2
share an element, then construct a graph whose labelled nodes are the elements of
c <dig> c2
and whose edges are defined between all elements of c <dig>  and between all elements of c2; we color the nodes of the graph with a unique color and call the resulting graph an aggregate . if c <dig> c2
do not have any element in common, construct a clique associated to each cluster and color them differently; the two labelled cliques are aggregates.

 <dig>  remove the first cluster c on the top of the list and check whether it shares some elements with existing aggregates. if it does, and the aggregates are
a1…ak, where possibly k =  <dig>  then construct an aggregate by adding to the ai’s the “new” nodes of c  and all edges between all nodes in c; if the shared nodes are several and colored differently, then color the new nodes of c with a new color. otherwise, color the new nodes of c with the same color as the one used in ai. if c does not share any node with existing aggregates, then construct a clique and color it with a new color. the new graph forms an aggregate. re-iterate until all clusters from the list are considered.

the resulting graph is called aggregation graph. aggregates are disjoint graphs containing all nodes within clusters. we call key aggregates those subgraphs of the aggregation graph whose nodes are colored with the same color. key aggregates describe clustering units that should be biologically interpreted.

in the following, without loss of generality, the term “key aggregate” will also be used to refer to the set of elements labeling the nodes of the key aggregate subgraph. using sets, we present a toy example to illustrate the aggregation step. let
c1 = { <dig> ,3},c2 = { <dig> ,5},
c3 = { <dig> ,8},c4 = { <dig> ,10},
c5 = { <dig> , <dig> }
be five affine clusters issued from the first step of the algorithm. let
s <dig> s <dig> s <dig> 
s <dig> s <dig> be their respective decreasing scores. by step  <dig>  c1
and c <dig> are fused together in a set c <dig>  = { <dig> , <dig> ,5}
because they have the same score and they share a common element. the set
c <dig>  has score s <dig>  in step  <dig>  the algorithm selects c <dig> 
and c <dig>  that is the two clusters with highest score, it verifies that they share no common element and it labels c <dig> ,c <dig> with two different colors. then, it selects c4
, since it has the highest score among those clusters not yet examined. cluster
c <dig> shares an element with c <dig> and it is fused with c <dig> into a new set c <dig> , keeping the color label of c <dig>  by iterating step  <dig> 
c <dig> is considered. it shares an element with
c <dig> 
and one with c <dig> . the new set c6 = { <dig> } is constructed by subtracting c <dig> ∪c <dig>  from
c <dig> and it is labelled by a new color. the three sets
c <dig> , c <dig>  and
c <dig> are the resulting key aggregates. strictly speaking, the algorithm provides a colored graph structure that traces the relations between the different key aggregates .

it might be useful to rank aggregates with respect to the strength of the clusters that form them. this can be done by associating to an aggregate two
senv
 scores: the first is the senv
 score of the first cluster entering the aggregate and the second is the senv
 score of the last cluster entering the aggregate.

algorithmic complexity
the construction of the n × n
matrix of environmental scores in the clustering step is realized in o. the sorting of the clusters generated by the clustering step is done in o and the construction of the key aggregate sets in o. clag time performance is reported in additional file 1: table s <dig> for the biological datasets discussed later.

application to biological data
we analyze four datasets  <cit>  to illustrate clag performance and large applicability. clag will be compared to k-means  <cit> , c-means  <cit> , mclust  <cit> , hierarchical clustering  <cit>  and soft-constraints affinity propagation   <cit>  methods.

breast tumor mirna expression data
a panel of  <dig> different breast cancer samples was chosen to represent three common phenotypes and was blindly analyzed for mirna expression levels by microarray profiling  <cit> . for each breast cancer sample,  <dig> different mirnas were considered. hierarchical clustering  generates a distance tree associating three known phenotypes of breast cancer .

and senv >  <dig>  and zoom on the matrix. the red color scale is associated to small values and the green color scale to high values. the vast majority of values in the matrix is low and clag allows to distinguish them because of quantile segmentation. b: zoom on the matrix in a where the three aggregation graphs in c are indicated. c: aggregation graph produced by clag where three main clusters  are connected among each other by grey edges. notice that the three clusters are indicated on the top of the zoomed matrix in b. numbers labelling the nodes of the graph correspond to samples, that is columns in the matrix. d: dendrogram produced from the data clustered in a with a hierarchical clustering algorithm based closely on the average-linkage method of sokal and michener and developed in  <cit> . three main clusters are found. the numbers are colored as in c and they are associated to columns in the matrix in b. for each sample, we denote the presence  or absence  of factors erbb <dig> and er whose overexpression is known to vary across cancer types.

when clag is applied to the dataset, it classifies all patients at Δ ≥  <dig> , for scores ≥ <dig> . for these thresholds, the number of key aggregates remains stable  and we have chosen to describe in detail clag’s results for Δ =  <dig> , where it detects three key aggregates. its aggregation graph  provides information on the proximity of the samples that is not described by hierarchical clustering . namely, there are two key aggregates, red and green in figure 3c, that are formed by samples having a highly different behavior: we observe an almost complete absence of edges between the two key aggregates in the aggregation graph. the third key aggregate  plays a connecting role for the first two, with all its nodes that are linked to both green and red nodes. this division is well supported by the clinical interpretation of the samples. in fact, clag’s aggregates match well with three clinical pathologic features  that have been observed in gene expression profiling of clinically distinct breast cancer phenotypes: the green aggregate in figure 3c corresponds to erbb <dig> overexpression  and the red one corresponds to er overexpression . the violet key aggregate presents less sharp tendencies with a presence of erbb <dig> on 3/ <dig> data points and of er on 2/ <dig> data points. the exact contingency table test for clag’s clustering  gives p =  <dig> e− <dig> and a sum of the probabilities of unusual tables of  <dig> . these probabilities improve the ones computed over the tree organization in figure 3d  giving p =  <dig> e− <dig> and a sum of probabilities of unusual tables of  <dig> . in both cases, the probabilities of unusual tables are small enough to reject the null hypothesis. .

values, are plot for different score thresholds.

on this dataset, k-means, c-means and mclust fail clustering by proposing one or several clusters of single elements .

brain cancer gene expression data
the expression levels of more than  <dig> genes for  <dig> patients have been monitored and classified in  <dig> different brain cancer diagnosis by an a posteriori assessment method  <cit>  . to test clag classification we used a normalized dataset of  <dig> genes where data arrays for each patient were filtered, log-normalized to mean zero and variance one  <cit> . we checked the outcomes against the assessment.

for Δ ≥  <dig>  and by considering all affine clusters with scores  ≥  <dig>  clag aggregates all  <dig> patients . for Δ =  <dig> , clag produces  <dig> key aggregates with  <dig> errors , where errors count both misclassified patients and unclassified patients. several isolated clusters of the same diagnosis are found. the medulloblastoma patients are all grouped together. normal patients form a separate group and do not mix. errors are mostly due to misclassification of pnet patients that mix with glioma and medulloblastoma patients.

values, computed on all affine clusters . errors count both misclassified and unclustered patients. notice that for all points plotted at Δ ≥  <dig> , the number of clustered patients is maximal, that is  <dig> . b: number of clustered patients evaluated on aggregation of clusters having scores greater than a fixed threshold. c: number of pnet patients aggregated at increasing Δ
values, for different thresholds. curves show that pnet patients aggregate slowly since they belong to clusters with low environmental and symmetric scores. d: number of patients that are correctly classified together.

while Δ
increases until  <dig> , the number of correctly classified patients remains essentially stable and the number of key aggregates, after augmenting for a while, gets smaller . as expected, aggregation of clusters with increasingly large Δ values, shows an increased number of errors for a decreased number of key aggregates. see figure 5abd.

with Δ =  <dig>  and score threshold =  <dig> , clustered patients decrease to  <dig> and they organize in  <dig> diagnosis specific key aggregates, with no mix. no pnet patients are classified. this suggests that clusters obtained for scores ≥ <dig> are formed by a core of patients that are well classified and that misclassified patterns, like pnet, are peripherical cluster elements . the possibility to provide information on the structure of the dataset and on the internal organization of the clusters is a feature of clag.

in  <cit> , patients were clustered using a hierarchical clustering. even though the structure of the clustering is similar to the one we obtained, there is no clear-cut partition in  <dig> groups of patients, several diagnosis mix together and pnet patients appear in several distinguished subtrees. our results have been also compared to the ones obtained with scap  <cit> . scap outputs  <dig> clusters with  <dig> errors. normal patients form a separate group and all scap errors are due to misclassification of pnet patients that are found spread on three distinguished clusters associated to malignant tumor diagnosis. both clag and scap provide information on the structure of the dataset. k-means, c-means and mclust propose clusters that highly mix the five diagnosis. see additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file  <dig> for a comparative assessment.

coevolved residues in protein families data
a large number of coevolution analysis methods investigate evolutionary constraints in protein families via correlated distribution of amino-acids in sequences. given a protein family, they produce a square matrix of coevolving scores between pairs of alignment positions in the sequence alignment associated to the protein family  <cit> . clustering of the score matrix helps to identify groups of coevolving residues often characterizing important functional and structural properties for the protein family. the identification of groups displaying the highest signals of coevolution has been previously realized by hand.

we applied clag to the coevolution score matrix produced by the coevolution analysis method mst  <cit>  on the globin protein family, to automatically detect coevolving groups of residues. by increasing Δ, clag detects clusters of maximal scores with progressively larger sizes as well as new clusters . there are two main key aggregates that are detected at Δ =  <dig>  and grow larger at Δ =  <dig> .  the first key aggregate  corresponds to the conserved binding site enveloping the haem and the second key aggregate  corresponds to a group of residues that is known to be associated to the allosteric function  <cit> . by analyzing clusters with weaker strength,  <dig> more key aggregates were found and three of them  have been highlighted in  <cit>  too, as belonging to the globin subunits binding sites. these five key aggregates are the first ones to form during the aggregation step .

with environmental and symmetric scores = 1

and Δ =  <dig> 
, the score of aggregation is =  <dig>  for Δ =  <dig> 
, scores are ≥  <dig> . key aggregates obtained without considering the symmetricity condition in clag are reported  for Δ =  <dig> 
and environmental scores =  <dig>  b: hierarchical clustering of the dataset where key aggregates of Δ =  <dig> 
and scores ≥  <dig>

values, are plot for different score thresholds.

notice that for this dataset, n⊆e and that the aggregates were found by applying clag under the symmetricity condition. the identification of clusters grouping elements with symmetric behavior turned out to be important for distinguishing the red and the olive green aggregates, known to present functionally distinct roles for the globin . without symmetricity, the red aggregate would be identified at Δ =  <dig> 
 but the olive green would systematically collapse with other aggregates. in general, one can observe that with no symmetricity condition, aggregates will be larger, possibly characterized as the join union of aggregates determined with symmetricity, and possibly including other residues, that were not considered as coevolving by the symmetric condition.

agglomerative hierarchical clustering  <cit>  detects the red and olive green clusters but it also detects other clusters as subtrees of comparable height without distinguishing them .

when we compare k-means to clag on this dataset, we observe that several key aggregates detected by clag are grouped within a single k-means cluster . in particular, red and green key aggregates are grouped together  and this hints that no biological interpretation can be associated with k-means clusters. slightly better results are obtained with c-means, mclust and scap, where the overall clusters structure is similar to the one found by clag, but no clear cut identification of our two stronger key aggregates is obtained . our red and olive green key aggregates are separated in distinguished clusters but mixed with many data points mainly belonging to the blue key aggregate. also, for scap, convergence into  <dig> clusters classifying all  <dig> alignment positions is obtained for p =  <dig> , in less than  <dig> iteration steps , but scap greatest stability in p variation is reached for  <dig> clusters , corresponding to the two large subtrees of the hierarchical tree in figure 6b. notice that all residues are considered by these clustering tools and that many of them do not coevolve.

clag in synthetic datasets
we run clag on six different synthetic datasets with gaussian clusters, each of them constituted by  <dig> vectors, organized in  <dig> clusters and defined in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dimensions respectively. clag succeeds in clustering correctly all datasets for Δ ≥  <dig> 
 by producing  <dig> key aggregates describing the  <dig> original clusters. k-means provides misclassification errors on all datasets while c-means behaves well on dimensions  <dig> and  <dig>  and optimizes to less than  <dig> clusters datasets of higher dimension. mclust clusterizes based on ellipsoidal models with a very small number of components and, in this manner, it fuses together several clusters, for all the multi-dimensional datasets. in dimension  <dig>  it generates a single huge cluster. in conclusion, as the dimension of the data goes higher all methods produce classification errors whereas clag continues to identify correctly the  <dig> clusters.

and scores ≥  <dig> . b: curves associated to different score thresholds describing the number of elements that are clustered by clag while varying Δ
values. note that the number of elements is  <dig> for Δ =  <dig> 
and maximal scores. different clustering algorithms were run on this dataset: k-means , c-means , mclust . k-means and c-means were run with  <dig> clusters, and mclust with “ellipsoidal, equal variance with  <dig> components” as best model . for k-means, clusters  <dig>   <dig> are split in several k-means clusters while clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  are fused together. c-means clusters the original ensemble in only  <dig> clusters: clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  are grouped together. in a, c, d, e elements are represented by circles. different clusters are distinguished by different colors. figures acde are realized by plotting the first two columns of the matrix describing the dataset.

also, we generated 2d sets of points with different shapes and degrees of density and checked the performance of k-means, c-means, mclust and clag on these datasets . when sets of points are well separated in space, clag clusters them properly independently of shapes . the same happens for c-means but neither for k-means nor mclust. when sets of points overlap together, clag tends to cluster the sets in a single key aggregate  contrary to the other tools that prefer to split the datasets in small clusters, sometimes erroneously .

clag’s parameterization
clag is based on two parameters, Δ
and the threshold for environmental and symmetric scores. these parameters can be used together for evaluating whether all elements of the dataset are supposed to be clustered together or for determining how many clusters a dataset is made of. the main point is to find an interval of values Δ where the number of clustered elements as well as the number of key aggregates remains essentially stable. for the brain cancer dataset , stability is observable for the curve dependent on scores threshold =  <dig> starting from Δ ≥  <dig> ; for the breast cancer dataset, score threshold = 0
and Δ ≥  <dig>  identify the clustering of all data points ; the globin dataset displays a stable behavior for the curve associated to threshold = 1
and for Δ
values >  <dig> 
.in the case of the synthetic datasets, stability is reached for Δ ≥  <dig>  and arbitrary thresholds . it could be envisageable to implement these criteria to render automatic the identification of best parameter values.

CONCLUSIONS
clag is an unsupervised non-hierarchical and deterministic clustering algorithm applicable to m × n
matrices. its range of application is spread as illustrated by the datasets we discussed. contrary to algorithms like the k-means, the number of clusters to identify is not specified, but there is a parameter to the algorithm, Δ, which influences the number of clusters that can be predicted. this parameter modulates the proximity between elements that are accepted to be “similar” or “close”. based on Δ, the clustering step determines if two elements in n are similar with respect to the environment e  providing, in this way, a numerical score that describes the strength of the signal. the aggregation step combines clusters sharing the same data points and it produces key aggregates, that is disjoint clusters. clustering depends on Δ
and aggregation depends on the scores threshold.

an important feature is that clag does not try to clusterize all data points, but it combines just those that are sufficiently similar to be clustered together. because of this relaxed clustering constraint, after the clustering step, the user learns which data points drove the clustering with respect to Δ. the gradual extension and creation of clusters with increasing Δ
values, provides the user with information on the structure of the dataset.

the cluster structure present in biological datasets can be systematically investigated with clag. this underlying structure between data points is typically not a tree but a graph, and clag provides an aggregation graph describing it.

known clustering methods ask for a data point to belong to at most one cluster. for certain applications, this is a limitation. for instance, for coevolution score matrices, a fixed alignment position in a protein family could be subjected to more than one evolutionary constraint and therefore might play several roles for the protein. unlike other approaches, clag allows for a position to belong to several clusters. hence, the user can extract useful information from the clustering step and eventually use the outcomes of this step as a clustering result.

for the user, scores are relevant to evaluate clusters strength and to decide whether clusters should be considered important or not for their analysis. this numerical feature is missing for the hierarchical clustering where it becomes hard, at times, to choose among subtrees based on their height. the globin analysis is an example of this . also, scores reflect the structure of the dataset. they highlight where closest data points are located and which subsets collapse together if more relaxed proximity conditions, that is larger Δ values, are allowed.

clag second step  is applied only on affine clusters, that is clusters with positive environmental  score. notice that the general notion of affinity, asking for senv > δ for some hyperparameter δ
that has been mentioned above could be used to parameterize further the algorithm to allow the user to set a threshold on affinity for the aggregation step. the definition of affine cluster, setting δ =  <dig>  asks for at least half of the characteristics of a data point to be shared with the other data points of the cluster, and it seems to set a reasonable condition to compute key aggregates of sufficiently high strength.

we should warn potential users that the definitions of environmental score and affine cluster implicitly assume that all the m characters are equally important for clustering purposes. this can be a strong assumption, as in many situations it could not be known whether all the characters in a dataset are relevant for clustering purposes.

clag has been compared to various clustering approaches on four biological datasets, and showed to be more informative and accurate than hierarchical agglomerative clustering and k-means. the clustering of the dataset of coevolving residues showed scap to furnish inaccurate results due to its need to consider all data points instead of a subset of those. on the brain cancer dataset, where the full set of patients should be clustered, scap and clag showed a comparable performance. finally, clag does not suffer of the convergence problem proper to ap and scap, and always leads to clustering. compared to mclust, clag shows better performance in clustering multidimensional datasets where the size of the environment m is much larger than the size of the set of elements n. this is seen for brain cancer and breast cancer datasets as well as for multidimensional synthetic datasets. mclust outcomes are not unexpected. in fact, the gaussian mixture models implemented in mclust may become over-parametrized and give poor performances on multidimensional datasets  <cit> . similarly, the poor performances of mclust and of k-means on the synthetic 2d datasets is likely due to the fact that these two clustering methods implicitly assume that all groups of elements have spherical or elliptical shapes, which is not the case in the described examples. we should notice that on other datasets, as the iris dataset for instance, characterized by few dimensions and a large number of elements, clag does not perform well compared to the success of mixture-model-based methods  <cit>  that detect the correct number of iris flower groups by selecting variables appropriately, showing that clustering on all variables always provides an ambiguous result on this dataset.
