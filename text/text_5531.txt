BACKGROUND
micrornas  are an abundant class of small non-coding rnas  that function to control gene expression and restrict viral replication in host cells  <cit> . dysregulation of mirs expression is associated with numerous disease states. the human genome encodes hundreds of mirs with the potential to regulate up to 92 % of genes, mostly through inhibition of translation and/or promotion of mrna degradation. growing evidence indicates that mirs and transcription factors can jointly regulate target gene expression in the form of feed-forward or feedback loops  <cit> . these regulatory loops serve as important motifs in functional networks and play critical roles in multiple biological processes, either in healthy states or diseases. mir-mediated gene silencing has been shown to be a key event in viral pathogenesis . several cellular mirs show substantial changes in expression upon hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> , and contributes to viral latency in primary cd4+ t lymphocytes  <cit> . hiv- <dig> infectivity has been reported to be influenced by cellular mirs  <cit> . multiple cellular mirs can modulate both viral infectivity and replication by targeting directly the viral genome or decreasing the expression of host proteins required for virus replication  <cit> . more recently, changes in mirs expression profile of cd4+ t lymphocytes after exposure to hiv- <dig> allowed to discriminate among different stages of hiv infection  <cit> .

dendritic cells  are professional antigen presenting cells playing a critical role in the orchestration and fine-tuning of the immune response  <cit> . at the mucosal sites, they are primary targets of hiv- <dig> infection, co-opted by the virus to facilitate its transfer to t lymphocyte and body dissemination  <cit> . however, how hiv- <dig> manipulates dc biology to use these cells to its own advantage without marked cytopathic effects is still unclear. in these cells, the interaction of the envelope protein gp <dig> with surface receptors triggers early signaling events even in the absence of productive infection and may profoundly influence cellular behavior and secretory profile  <cit> . in this respect, we have recently reported that dc exposure to hiv- <dig> r <dig> gp <dig> resulted in production of il- <dig> via mapk/nf-kb pathways which, in turn, activated stat <dig> by an autocrine loop  <cit> . this modulation is dependent on c-c chemokine receptor  <dig> , the principal coreceptor of hiv- <dig> entry in dc, and it is specific for gp <dig>  since the c-c chemokine ligand  <dig> , the most specific natural ligand for ccr <dig>  did not induce il- <dig> production and stat <dig> activation in these cells  <cit> .

interestingly, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that mirs are closely associated with the stat <dig> signaling pathway supporting the existence of regulatory feedback loops between mirs and several components of the stat <dig> pathway in different cancer contexts  <cit> .

in this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis to identify a panel of mirs that present one or more stat <dig> binding sites in their promoter region. moreover, we selected mir targeting genes belonging to stat <dig> signaling pathway and determined whether the addition of gp <dig> to monocyte- derived dcs  would alter their expression levels. we found that gp120-triggered stat <dig> activation directly influenced the expression of mir- <dig>  mir-181b and mir- <dig>  bioinformatics analysis of mir putative targets unraveled that these genes mainly belong to biological process related to ‘transcription’ in a complex network of interactions relevant to hiv-dc biology. finally, we validated a selection of putatively regulated proteins and we showed that the expression of gp120-deregulated mirs is in agreement with the abundance of their target proteins .

RESULTS
promoters of precursor mirs contain several predicted stat <dig> binding sites
we have recently reported that exposure of mddcs to r <dig> gp <dig> activates the stat3/il- <dig> axis  <cit> . stat <dig> has been predicted to regulate the transcription of a great number of mirs and putative stat <dig> binding sites were identified in many mir promoters  <cit> . starting from these data, we generated a list of mirs that was then used to predict the number of putative stat <dig> binding sites. table  <dig> shows the result of this prediction by which the number of putative stat <dig> binding sites employing the matrix-derived models  and three different stat <dig> binding motifs  have been obtained. information on position, strand, score value and statistical significance of the predicted stat <dig> binding sites are reported in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> analysis of the promoter regions of putative stat <dig> regulated mirs

to select mirs specifically related to stat <dig> biological processes and directly implicated in the regulation of stat <dig> signaling pathway activated in gp120-exposed mddcs  <cit> , the same mir list was intersected with the group of validated mirs annotated in the mirwalk database whose targets belong to stat <dig> signaling pathway. this analysis led to a restricted list of  <dig> mirs potentially regulated by stat <dig> and targeting genes annotated in the stat <dig> signaling pathway  that is shown in table  <dig>  detailed information on this analysis is provided in additional file  <dig>  interestingly, some of the mirs reported in table  <dig>  were already predicted to be regulated by stat <dig> and also experimentally validated .table  <dig> list of genes in the stat <dig> signaling pathway targeted by stat <dig> regulated mir

hiv- <dig> gp120-induced activation of stat <dig> modulates mir expression profiles in mddcs
on the basis of the bioinformatics analyses illustrated above, we first experimentally validated a panel of mirs including mir- <dig>  mir-125b, mir-135b and mir-181b in gp120-treated mddcs by real-time quantitative pcr . as shown in fig.  <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-181b  were down- and up-regulated, respectively, in cells treated with r <dig> gp <dig> at 18 h. conversely, no significant difference was observed at 6 h. likewise, gp <dig> treatment did not result in any significant modulation of mir-125b, whereas mir-135b did not amplify . although mir modulation was quite modest, it showed reproducibility among all donors tested  and results were statistically significant with respect to untreated controls. then, to better define the role of stat <dig> in the gp120-induced modulation of mir- <dig> and mir-181b, we assessed the expression profile of these mirs in the presence of stattic, a non-peptidic small molecule inhibiting stat <dig> activation and dimerization  <cit> . although the addition of stattic did not per se modulate the baseline expression levels of these mirs, it completely abolished the gp120-induced down-modulation of mir- <dig>  as well as the up-modulation of mir-181b , thus confirming a role for stat <dig> in the regulation of these mirs in mddcs.fig.  <dig> real-time qpcr of hiv gp <dig> modulated mirs. cells were treated with gp <dig> for 6–18 h or left untreated in the presence or in the absence of stattic  and total rna was extracted, reverse transcribed and subjected to real-time qpcr. relative fold of change of expression of mir- <dig> a-c, mir-181b , in gp <dig> stimulated mddcs against untreated controls were calculated using the comparative ct  method. pcr were run in triplicate and the mean of  <dig>  or  <dig> c-d independent experiments ± se is shown. p values were calculated by anova and statistical significance is indicated vs untreated control



hiv- <dig> gp <dig> and lps have been reported to induce, at some extent, overlapping effects in a variety of cell types, as both molecules promote cytokine/chemokine secretion and modulate cell activation state. furthermore, mddcs activated by lps show a typical mir expression profile that includes a remarkable up-modulation of mir- <dig> and to a lesser extent, of mir- <dig> . of note, both mirs have been reported to play an important role in the modulation of the immune response  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  while lps markedly up-modulated mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression, at early time points , gp <dig> exhibited a significant inhibitory effect  on mir- <dig> that disappeared at later time points , while mir- <dig> was not affected.fig.  <dig> real-time qpcr of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  cells were treated, and relative fc of expression of mir- <dig> a and mir- <dig> b in gp120- or lps- stimulated mddcs against untreated controls were calculated as described in fig.  <dig>  pcr were run in triplicate and the mean of  <dig> independent experiments ± se is shown. p values were calculated by anova and statistical significance is indicated vs untreated control



in keeping with our previous observation that ccl <dig> does not affect the stat3/il- <dig> axis  <cit> , this chemokine, known as the most specific natural ligand engaging ccr <dig>  did not alter the expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181b expression, as well as that of mir- <dig> .table  <dig> effects of ccl <dig> on mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181b

on the basis of the results on the experimental validation of gp120-modulated mirs in mddcs, we integrated the initial target prediction analysis  by using our previously published procedure  <cit>  that exploits the predictions of three different algorithms . by this in-house r bioconductor script we obtained the combined list of unique predictions for mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181b. the complete list of target genes for each of these three gp120-modulated mirs is reported in additional file  <dig>  we found that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181b targeted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. to identify the genes targeted by more than one mir, we calculated the intersections among the three lists and represented them using venn diagrams . interestingly,  <dig> genes were targeted by all mirs . information concerning the putative binding sites are provided in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> overlap of predicted genes targeted by stat3-regulated mirs. venn diagram showing the overlap between predicted target genes of mir- <dig> , mir-181b  and mir- <dig> . the numbers in the intersections represent the number of target genes  targeted by two mirs  or by all of them . the majority of genes  are targeted by only one mir



mirs can regulate many target genes and modulate multiple pathways at the same time. to determine the biological processes and signaling pathways implicated in gp120-induced effects in mddcs, the predicted targets of the newly identified gp <dig> deregulated mirs were separately subjected to gene ontology and kegg pathway enrichment analysis, and annotated by means of david bioinformatics tool  <cit> . remarkably, the most significant  categories of biological processes identified for mir- <dig> and mir-181b were transcription, regulation of transcription, regulation of rna metabolic process, dna-dependent regulation of transcription . no statistically significant biological processes resulted for mir- <dig> targets, most probably due to the highly stringent selection criteria of the algorithm used . by taking the combined list of unique predictions for mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181b, the bioinformatics analysis outlined the term ‘regulation of transcription’ as the biological process with the highest number of annotated targets  . as expected, many transcripts annotated in the jak/stat signaling pathway, including stat members , stat regulatory factors , mapk family members such as mapk <dig> , map2k <dig> , map2k <dig> , map3k <dig> , apoptosis mediators as well as cytokines and cytokine receptors  were found in this biological process. furthermore, many of these genes belonged to more than one pathway, and were targeted by more than one mirs. fig.  <dig> shows the network of interactions, which may be deregulated upon exposure of mddcs to gp <dig> as a consequence of the altered expression of target genes, resulting from deregulation of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181b. this network included cell growth, proliferation, fate determination, and development, immunity, pro-inflammatory effects and apoptosis pathways. as shown in fig.  <dig>  bioinformatics prediction outlined the presence of a huge number of potential targets for the three mirs, whose functional validation  in our experimental model would require demanding and expensive analysis. thus, to overcome these issues, we refined data by selecting a panel of genes targeted by one or more gp <dig> deregulated mir belonging to the signaling cascade previously reported to be altered in gp120-exposed mddcs  <cit> . among various targets, we analyzed the expression level of genes belonging to the jak/stat signaling pathway , mapk/nf-kb signaling pathway , and apoptosis , by western blotting analysis, in gp120-exposed mddcs. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the results of protein expression analysis already reported in our previous study  or de novo carried out on the basis of bioinformatics analysis  clearly indicate that among the putative targets analyzed, only pias <dig> and stat <dig> protein expression levels are modulated, suggesting the involvement of gp120-deregulated mirs.table  <dig> gene ontology analysis for stat3-deregulated mirna

discussion
mirs play important roles in many biological processes, including cellular defense against viral infection  <cit> . increasing evidence has emerged that host mirs serve in animal cells to restrict viral infections. in turn, many viruses evolved strategies to counteract mirs action and may encode their own mirs  <cit> . in hiv- <dig> infection, many mechanisms underlying the capacity of the virus to induce immune destruction have been elucidated. however, the important role that mirs play in hiv- <dig> pathogenesis is only now emerging  <cit> .

studies carried out in pbmc highlighted the importance of the rna interference machinery in hiv infection, in regulating viral replication  <cit>  and latency  <cit>  as well as in defining different stages of disease  <cit> . likewise, in monocytes/macrophages the differential expression of some mirs has been associated with susceptibility to infection  <cit> . conversely, few studies have so far addressed the question of whether hiv- <dig> products may play a role in mirs modulation in the absence of productive infection. in this respect, orecchini and co-workers reported a direct involvement of tat, ectopically expressed, in the up-modulation of mir- <dig>  <cit> . likewise, mir expression analysis carried out by bignami and colleagues in healthy cd4+ t cells exposed to gp <dig> in vitro, outlined that mirs profile could be not only the result of a productive infection but also of exposure to hiv products that leave a signature in immune cells  <cit> .

in keeping with these observations, and based on the identification of stat <dig> binding motifs in the promoter region of a panel of selected mirs, we experimentally validated that mddcs treated with gp <dig>  show a down-regulation of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression, whereas mir-181b is up-regulated at late time points. interestingly, ccr <dig> engagement by one of its most specific ligand  does not induce any change in the expression of these mirs, adding further evidence that the interaction of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> with ccr <dig> evokes complex and distinct signaling responses, differing from those activated by the coreceptors’ chemokine ligands . a growing body of evidence demonstrates that stat <dig> signaling pathway is closely associated with the transcriptional regulation of some mirs including mir- <dig> and mir-181b  <cit>  as well as mir- <dig>  <cit> . in keeping with these observations, we showed a striking direct relationship between stat <dig> activation and expression of mir- <dig> and mir-181b since the gp120-induced deregulation of both mirs is completely reverted in the presence of stattic. the time-course observed for the gp120-induced mir modulation support the hypothesis that late stat <dig> activation via il- <dig> production is responsible for this event as at earlier time points  we did not observe any changes in mirs expression. several studies independently support the hypothesis of regulatory circuits between mir and stat <dig> pathway in different cancer contexts linked to inflammation as a key component favoring tumorigenesis  <cit> . of note, the mir we found concomitantly deregulated in dc upon exposure to gp <dig> have been previously reported to belong to a regulatory loop contributing to stat3-mediated cancer development  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of hiv-induced mir modulation in human mddcs. mirs are important regulators of dc differentiation and activation  <cit>  and increased expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in dcs represents a general features associated with cell activation  <cit> . our finding that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are downregulated by gp <dig> together with our previous report that gp <dig> induces a tolerogenic-like dc phenotype  <cit>  suggests that these hiv-modulated mirs could play a role in viral-induced dc dysfunction. in this regards, independent studies correlated mir- <dig> expression with hiv infectivity and spreading. in particular, martinez-nunez and colleagues demonstrated that increased expression of mir- <dig> correlates with reduced levels of dc-sign expression thus limiting gp <dig> binding to dcs  <cit> . likewise, napuri and co-workers highlighted a synergy between hiv- <dig> and cocaine to lower mir- <dig> and mir-20a in mddcs that modulates dc-sign expression, dc maturation, and hiv infectivity  <cit> . finally, silencing of mir- <dig> in murine dcs is associated with reduced production of il- <dig>  <cit> .

moreover, gp120-deregulated mirs in mddcs have been found to be concomitantly regulated in different experimental settings  <cit> , and reported to regulate important biological processes relevant to dc-hiv interaction, including nf-kb signaling pathway  <cit> , dc maturation  <cit> , inflammation  and hiv replication  <cit> . by using a bioinformatics pipeline intersecting the predictions of three different algorithms  <cit> , we identified ‘regulation of transcription’ as one of the most significantly enriched biological process for these mirs. interestingly, among the overall list of mir targets, we found many genes related to the jak/stat signaling pathway, stat regulatory factors, nf-kb/mapk family members among others . several potential targets have been experimentally validated by assessing protein expression in mddcs exposed to gp <dig>  however, only two genes, that we previously reported to be regulated by gp <dig>  i.e. stat <dig> and pias <dig> were found to be modulated at the protein level. although the observation that stat <dig> activation is maintained despite the persistent pias <dig> up-regulation may at first glance appear contradictory, previous studies reported that stat <dig> activation and high levels of inhibitory molecules co-exist up to several hours following stimulation  <cit> . overall, this suggests that despite pias <dig> overexpression, its inhibitory function on stat <dig> activation might be altered in the presence of gp <dig> thus contributing to chronic immune activation. furthermore, it is also worth to be considered that although stat <dig> protein levels are not modulated by gp <dig>  the levels of stat <dig> are increased at late time points. in this regard, it has been reported that stat <dig> and stat <dig> balanced expression or phosphorylation levels may somehow regulate the extent of inflammation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the new data provided by the present study add further complexity to the model we previously postulated to describe the interaction between dcs and hiv- <dig> in the absence of productive infection. as shown in fig.  <dig>  gp <dig> triggers a cascade of signaling events initiated by early activation of stat <dig> leading to il- <dig> production. subsequently, il- <dig> determines a second round of stat <dig> activation responsible for mir regulation. although it remains to be demonstrated that mir deregulation directly impact the function of molecular components belonging to stat <dig> signaling, we exclude that these mirs directly regulate stat <dig> expression as identical levels of protein are found independently of gp <dig> exposure of dc. conversely, our data suggests that mirs could indirectly act on key regulators of stat3/il- <dig> axis ultimately contributing to the chronic immune activation observed in aids.fig.  <dig> schematic model of gp120-induced signalling pathways in mddcs. the cascade of signals triggered by r <dig> hiv- <dig> gp <dig> in mddcs is schematically shown



overall, this study provides new evidence for the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways triggered by hiv- <dig> in dcs, emphasizing the role of network interactions rather than individual connections among signaling components, transcription factors, mirs and their predicted targets in this process. due to the complexity of these regulatory networks, large scale studies and comprehensive analyses are therefore needed to validate the role of these mirs in hiv infection, and determine the effect of their selective targeting in disease phenotype and outcome. taken together experimental and bioinformatics analyses support the hypothesis that the stat3-regulated mirs validated in our study may have a role in the dc response to hiv. in this scenario, the determination of stat3-dependent mir deregulation, their hypothetical targets and interaction network may provide a broader view of the host-virus interactions.
