BACKGROUND
large-scale genomic changes, such as inversions, translocations, fusions and fissions, contribute to the reshuffling of the genomic architecture of organisms, providing new sources of variation on which natural selection can work. in recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies focusing on the role of chromosomal reorganizations in adaptation and speciation processes , and more specifically on the influence of genome shuffling in recombination . in this framework, the “suppressed recombination” model has provided compelling evidence and a theoretical framework to explain how chromosome rearrangements are involved in speciation  <cit> . under this model, reorganizations such as inversions would have a minimal influence on fitness when present in the heterokaryotype, but rather would suppress recombination between genomic regions involved in reorganization, leading to the reduction of gene flow between diverging populations. in this context, chromosomal rearrangements would act as genetic barriers, interfering in the fixation of favorable alleles and allowing for the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities  <cit> . as a way to test this hypothesis, subsequent studies have analyzed sequence divergence  between species as an indirect estimation of recombination  <cit> . high rates of sequence divergence detected in genes located at, or near, chromosomal rearrangements have often been interpreted as indirect evidence of chromosomal speciation through suppressed recombination . however, few empirical data have focused on the relationship between evolutionary breakpoint regions  and recombination rates. initial studies in drosophila described a strong reduction of recombination around inversion breakpoints and within the reorganization itself  <cit> . analogous studies in mammals are scarce, and the role of evolutionary regions in recombination has just started to be elucidated  <cit> .

whole-genome comparisons of distantly related mammalian species have provided the basis for establishing models that can explain genome dynamics . in this sense, different approaches have been developed in recent years to define homologous synteny blocks  and ebrs  among mammalian genomes . such reconstructions have revealed that genomic regions implicated in structural changes which occurred during the evolution of species are not distributed randomly through the genome, but instead they are clustered in regions that are more prone to break and reorganize . the fact that some chromosomal regions have been reused during mammalian chromosomal evolution questions  whether these regions are physically labile due to their dna sequence and/or structural chromatin conformation, and  whether they represent regions where selection against breakpoints is minimal  <cit> . regarding the first assumption, previous studies on mammalian genomes have provided compelling evidence that ebrs can be linked to the presence of repetitive elements, such as transposable elements, segmental duplications and/or tandem repeats . however, given the diversity of repetitive elements in ebrs, it is likely that sequence composition is not alone influencing genome instability, clamoring for the involvement of additional factors such as the state of the chromatin  or selective constraints. in this latter case, comparative genomic studies have shown that mammalian ebrs tend to localize in gene-dense regions  <cit> . but there is a long-standing debate on the mechanisms behind this well-known phenomenon. several lines of evidences indicate that ebrs are precisely located between genes  not necessarily affecting gene structure/function, while others have reported possible gene expression changes due to genome reshuffling .

given this context, the general picture of the genomic features and dna organization of genomic regions affected by structural reorganizations is still incomplete, as is that of how genomic changes are transmitted to the offspring during the formation of germ cells and contribute to speciation. if genomic shuffling does affect evolutionary processes through the mechanical shearing at evolutionary breakpoints, how does it impact on meiotic recombination? in this sense, the analysis of the most recent human and chimpanzee recombination maps has revealed that rearranged chromosomes presented lower recombination rates than chromosomes that did not suffer any reorganization since the human-chimpanzee common ancestor  <cit> . elucidating upon whether this pattern also holds for other mammalian species would have a relevant impact on our understanding of the role of genome shuffling in speciation. here, we have analyzed the effect of genomic structural changes on genetic recombination in the rhesus macaque to understand the mechanisms underlying chromosomal evolution in mammals and determine, in the long-term, the influence of chromosomal reorganizations on meiotic recombination. to this end, we have firstly characterized the genomic regions involved in chromosomal rearrangements between human and macaque genomes. the rhesus monkey  is a primate species widely used in both biomedicine and evolutionary studies . all members of the tribe papionini  are characterized by highly stable karyotypes that have been regarded to retain the ancestral catarrhini karyotype  <cit> . due to such characteristics, the macaque has often been used as a reliable primate out-group candidate for evolutionary studies when studying great apes. but despite its importance, little effort has been made in characterizing the genomic landscape of hsbs and ebrs in this species since the initial release of the rhesus macaque genome  <cit> . here we provide a detailed genomic map of the structural rearrangements between human and macaque. we have refined the genomic position of known rearrangements previously reported by cytogenetic approaches and described new putative micro-rearrangements  between human and macaque genomes. moreover, we have analyzed the repetitive dna content and gene density in relation to chromosomal reorganizations, as well as the effect of inversions in meiotic recombination, detecting immune-related genes in evolutionary breakpoint regions in the macaque genome.

RESULTS
homologous synteny blocks  and evolutionary breakpoint regions  in human and rhesus macaque genomes
in order to analyze the chromosomal reorganizations  between human and rhesus macaque, two different algorithms were applied: syntenytracker and cassis . both approaches can detect hsbs and ebrs in both species based on the positions of orthologous genes. by analyzing a total of  <dig>  orthologous genes between homo sapiens  and macaca mulatta , syntenytracker detected  <dig> ebrs in both genomes, with a median length of  <dig> kbp in the human genome  and  <dig>  kbp in the macaque  . cassis, on the other hand, detected  <dig> ebrs in the human genome, and  <dig> ebrs in the macaque , with a median length of  <dig>  kbp for human ebrs , and  <dig> kbp for the rhesus macaque  . merging the results obtained with both approaches resulted in  <dig> ebrs in the human genome and  <dig> ebrs in the macaque. after applying a conservative filtering process , we obtained a total of  <dig> ebrs and  <dig> hsbs in the human genome with a median ebr length of  <dig>  kbp . likewise, we obtained  <dig> ebrs and  <dig> hsbs in the macaque genome , with a median ebr length of  <dig> kbp .table  <dig>

our own study represents a departure from those conducted previously  <cit>  in that it relies on a detailed comparison between human and rhesus macaque genomes based on orthologous genes and whole-genome sequence alignments. previous cytogenetic studies delineated the primate ancestral karyotype, defining conserved syntenies among species and the direction of chromosomal rearrangements in a phylogenetic context  <cit> . species from the tribe papionini – including macaca, papio, mandrillus and cercocebus – are characterized by sharing the same karyotype and large-scale chromosomal reorganizations since their divergence from a common primate ancestor  <cit> . when comparing these species with the human karyotype, previous cytogenetic studies described the presence of  <dig> intra- and inter-chromosomal reorganizations  <cit> . these rearrangements include  <dig> pericentric inversions affecting eleven chromosomes, four paracentric inversions involving four chromosomes and four fusions/fissions  <cit> . overall, our in silico approach confirmed the presence of the above-mentioned macro-reorganizations and, thus, refined the breakpoints involved in both genomes . moreover, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> previously undetected ebrs in the human and rhesus genome, respectively, affecting  <dig> different chromosomes . this resulted in  <dig> previously undetected reorganizations in the human genome and  <dig> in the macaque. although previous cytogenetic studies have reported that six chromosomes  have been maintained collinear between both species, our results suggest that only chromosomes mmu <dig>  mmu <dig> and mmu <dig> have maintained a complete conserved synteny. six new indels  were also identified, ranging from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig> . <dig> kbp in five different chromosomes .

tandem repeats do not accumulate in ebrs in the macaque genome; instead, they are correlated with the evolutionary history of chromosomes
previous comparative genomic studies have revealed that mammalian breakpoint regions are especially rich in repetitive elements, such as segmental duplications , repetitive sequences  <cit> , transposable elements and long regulatory regions . we tested whether this pattern applies to the rhesus macaque, a species that has retained the ancestral catarrhini karyotype  <cit> . to this end, the genome distribution of tandem repeats  in this species was analyzed. a total of  <dig>  loci, representing  <dig>  mbp of the whole genome was detected. in order to study the genome-wide distribution of tr, the number of base pairs involved in tr by screening non-overlapping windows of  <dig> kbp along the genome was analyzed. when considering the number of base-pairs  of each window covered by tr, we observed a significant increase of tr in telomeric and centromeric regions when compared to hsbs and ebrs , mirroring previous observations obtained in the human and great apes  <cit> . subsequently, we tested whether there was a correspondence between tr and ebrs in all macaque chromosomes. our analysis indicated that ebrs are not significantly enriched by tandem repeats when compared to hsbs .

recent studies in great apes have found differences in the genome-wide distribution of tr among species, suggesting that they might be correlated with the evolutionary history of each primate chromosome  <cit> . more specifically, qualitative comparisons of tr distribution in great apes indicated that the tr landscape might have been conserved in collinear chromosomes, but altered in those reorganized chromosomes  <cit> . under this assumption, genomic regions that have suffered more rearrangements during their evolution are expected to concentrate more repetitive sequences than are conserved regions. in fact, our dataset supports this assumption since rearranged chromosomes in the macaque lineage  have more trs than do those that maintained the ancestral form  . despite the limitations of the current rhesus macaque draft genome assembly and annotation  <cit> , this view is consistent with the lack of differences found in tr density between ebrs and hsbs in the macaque, which has maintained an ancestral karyotype within catarrhini and, consequently, can be considered to have retained a more conserved chromosome complement  than have those of great apes  <cit> .

defense-responsive genes are over-represented in ebrs
once the evolutionary genomic landscape of the macaque was established, the genome-wide distribution of genes was further examined, paying special attention to gene ontology. a total of  <dig>  genes was included in the analysis:  <dig>  protein-coding genes;  <dig>  non-coding rna genes and  <dig>  pseudogenes. we scrutinized each macaque chromosome’s complete sequence using non-overlapping windows of  <dig> kbp in order to analyze the distribution of genes genome-wide. the mean distribution is  <dig>  genes per  <dig> kbp  in the whole macaque genome. when analyzing the distribution of protein-coding genes in more detail, a higher gene density in ebrs was detected , when compared with hsbs  . therefore, our results indicate the presence of ebrs in gene-rich regions, in line with previous observations in mammals using multi-species comparative maps  <cit> . in trying to understand the reasons behind this pattern, initial studies reported the intergenic location of mammalian ebrs  <cit> , while recent studies have paid special attention to the adaptive role of ebrs  <cit> . this has been the case of the pig, for example, where ebrs have been found to be especially rich in taste perception networks  <cit> , suggesting that genome reshuffling significantly contributed to adaptation and the development of lineage-specific traits. moreover, it has also been suggested that inversions can suppress recombination within the affected zones . consequently, rearranged sequences could accumulate alleles, which might be adaptive for the population, and this could generate reproductive isolation leading, eventually, to speciation.

with this in mind, the function of the genes located at or near ebrs was analyzed in the macaque genome through the analysis of go terms enrichment. we focused our study on the genes located in the positions of the ebrs detected in silico, considering flanking regions of ± <dig> kbp in size in order to cover genes that overlapped ebr starts and/or ends. we applied the functional annotation clustering tool from david database  <cit>  using a background list containing  <dig>  protein-coding genes. this was created by filtering the total protein-coding genes list available in the database, discarding  <dig>  genes located in the centromeres and telomeres. using this approach we found that macaque ebrs are enriched in genes related to the immune system. in fact, we detected a single functional module significantly associated to ebrs . this functional module included  <dig> genes implicated in the immune response  located in seven different macaque ebrs . interestingly, five of these genes are beta-defensins, and are clustered in mmu <dig> ebr involved in the pericentric inversion that occurred after macaque and human divergence . beta-defensins are antimicrobial peptides involved in the resistance to microbial colonization of the epithelial surface  <cit> . this cluster, whose expression is restricted to the male reproductive tract, is the result of a series of duplication events subsequently shaped by the action of positive selection  <cit> . in fact, previous studies have shown a marked differential expression of defb <dig> and defb <dig>  in human and macaque reproductive tissues  <cit> . since chromosomal rearrangements are sources of genome variation, it might be possible that they could have influenced the structure of regulatory regions in those genes near ebrs. moreover, and in line with these observations, we also identified an alfa-defensin cluster in the vicinities of the ebr detected in mmu <dig> . this gene cluster has been previously described as an example of rapid evolution in primates  <cit> . developing protection to new microbial infections is among one of the great challenges that species confront during the adaptation to new ecological niches. thus, the generation of new defensin variants through different mechanisms, such as sequence modifications when a chromosomal reorganization occurs, could lead to adaptation to new environments. in fact, defensin clusters have also been described as being located in ebrs in cetartiodactyla  <cit> , suggesting the importance of genome reshuffling as an important source of new gene variants.table  <dig>

moreover, we also investigated genes located within the inverted regions that are specific for the macaque linage, as they could have played an adaptive role in this species. statistically significant enrichment was detected  for defense-response genes within the paracentric inversion affecting mmu <dig>  a chromosomal reorganization that has been fixed in the lineage leading to macaque . mmu <dig> inversion spans approximately  <dig> mbp across the centromere, involving one breakpoint located between  <dig> - <dig>  mbp and the other one located between  <dig> - <dig>  mbp . specifically, we identified two different statistically significant functional modules consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively – mostly coding for chemokines and the udp-glucuronosyltransferases 2b gene family –out of a total of  <dig> protein-coding genes present within the rearranged region  . both functional modules detected include immune-response genes that might have been influenced by the chromosomal rearrangement in the rhesus monkey. chemokines are known to play a role in the neuroinflammation process in response to infection, are present in the central nervous system  and are expressed in neurons and glial cells  <cit> . moreover, there is evidence suggesting that they are also involved in neurodevelopment and neurophysiological signaling  <cit> . udp-glucuronosyltransferases, on the other hand, are enzymes from the major pathway for the elimination of xenobiotics and endobiotics, and it has been suggested to play a role during speciation in the lineage leading to macaque  <cit> .table  <dig>

our observation of an over-representation of defense-responsive genes in both ebrs and macaque-specific inversions might suggest an adaptive role of reorganizations in this species. previous studies have reported that a small proportion of the mammalian genome, i.e., 4% in the case of the human genome, is under selective constraints, especially so for coding regions, introns and intergenic regions  <cit> . this suggests that in certain regions the fitness cost is so pronounced  that rearrangements are not allowed . but it has also been shown that this constraint could be somewhat relaxed in the promoters of genes linked to the immune system, reproduction and perception  <cit> , allowing for the generation of new variability to ensure adaptation to new environments. in light of our results, this might be the case for the genomic regions under study in the macaque. however, whether immune-related genes are directly involved in lineage-specific adaptation, as has been previously suggested for macaque  <cit> , needs further validation.

genome reshuffling and its effect on chromosome-specific recombination landscapes
once the genomic structural changes were defined in the rhesus macaque, together with the genome distribution of coding-genes across evolutionary regions, we further experimentally analyzed the meiotic recombination landscape as a way to explore the adaptive role of chromosomal changes. under the “suppressed recombination” model of chromosomal evolution, chromosome rearrangements would have a minimal influence on fitness, but would rather suppress recombination within the genomic regions affected, thus contributing to the accumulation of gene incompatibilities . the analysis of the most recent human and chimpanzee recombination maps inferred from genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism  data revealed that the standardized recombination rate was significantly lower in rearranged rather than in collinear chromosomes  <cit> . in the case of rhesus macaque, chromosome-specific recombination maps are available for very few chromosomes  <cit> , and whether or not chromosomal reorganizations that have been fixed in the macaque lineage have affected the recombination landscape was addressed in our study.

catarrhini monkeys, and more specifically the tribe papionini, are characterized by the presence of highly conserved karyotypes in terms of diploid number and chromosome homologies  <cit> . it has been described that species sharing the same karyotype  maintain the chromosomal distribution of meiotic crossover in conserved chromosomes on a broad scale   <cit> . therefore, we expect that the recombination pattern in macaca and cercocebus chromosomes  are conserved at the mbp resolution, thus allowing us to extrapolate the results obtained in both species, as previously described  <cit> . in this context, and taking advantage of the ebrs detected in silico in the macaque genome, we subsequently studied the chromosomal distribution of meiotic crossover  in macaque chromosomes affected by inversions since their catarrihini common ancestor . this was done by combining the immunostaining of meiotic proteins and fluorescence in situ hybridization  with specific bac clones spanning the ebrs detected in our in silico scanning . the analysis of cos distribution according to centromere positions and ebr-specific bac probes allowed us to experimentally determine the chromosome position of evolutionarily reorganized regions directly on pachytene chromosomes along chromosomal axes. our efforts were concentrated on three chromosomes, which represented three different evolutionary states:  a chromosome with a pericentric inversion  specific for the cercocebus and macaca lineages;  a paracentric inversion  that has been fixed in human and chimpanzee lineages, and therefore has been maintained collinear in the macaque lineage; and  a collinear chromosome  that has been maintained collinear since the catarrhini common ancestor. with this in mind, our main goal was two-fold:  reconstruct chromosome-specific recombination maps, and  encompass the distribution of meiotic crossovers across the inverted regions in order to test whether chromosomal inversions have an effect in reducing recombination.figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig> spermatocytes at pachynema was analyzed in order to obtain chromosome-specific recombination maps. we detected an average of  <dig>   mlh <dig> foci per analyzed cell . assuming that one mlh <dig> focus can be translated into  <dig> centimorgans  in genetic length according to previous studies , these recombination events correspond to an autosomal genetic length of  <dig>  cm for c. torquatus, very similar to the  <dig>  cm obtained in m. mulatta
 <cit> . our results also indicated that all chromosome pairs present, at least, one recombination event, with an average number of  <dig>  cos per homologous autosomic chromosome and  <dig>  cos per autosomic arm. moreover, a maximum of three recombination events in the large chromosomes was detected . in addition, for each chromosome analyzed, its total length  and the density of cos  per chromosome and chromosomal arm were calculated . all three chromosomes presented equivalent co densities along their synaptonemal complexes:  <dig>  cos/μm for cto <dig>   <dig>  cos/μm for cto <dig> and  <dig>  cos/μm for cto <dig>  in general, we detected an increase in co frequency towards the chromosomal telomeric regions, whereas centromere regions showed very low co frequencies , mirroring previous studies in mammalian species .figure  <dig>

subsequently, co density was analyzed inside and outside each inverted region using the selected bac probes to label the location of the breakpoint in each chromosomal region affected by the inversion . as a general trend, we observed low co densities within inverted regions , when compared to chromosomal regions outside the reorganized area  in both rearranged chromosomes . when analyzing the recombination rate within inverted regions among chromosomes, significant reduction of co density was observed in cto <dig> and cto <dig> within the inverted regions, when compared with regions outside the inversion . such differences were not observed in the simulated inversion in cto <dig>  a chromosome that has been maintained collinear in the macaque lineage .

subsequently, we tested whether the suppression of recombination observed within reorganized areas was due to the low recombination rate characteristic of pericentromeric regions. to do so, we considered as a pericentromeric region an area extending 30% of each chromosome arm from the centromere towards the telomeric region and compared it to the co density observed in the same region in the collinear chromosome . when all chromosomes were compared, our results showed no statistical differences among the pericentromeric regions in the small arms  ; however, differences in co density were significant when considering the long arms  . moreover, a significant reduction was observed in the co density within the rearranged region in cto <dig>  when compared to the collinear chromosome cto <dig> , . these differences were not significant, however, when the inverted region of cto <dig> was compared to the collinear chromosome cto <dig> .

what are the evolutionary implications of our observations in light of the “recombination suppression” model? despite the fact that the “recombination suppression” was initially proposed to explain differences in recombination rates within reorganized genomics in heterokaryotypes , we observed a reduction of recombination in fixed rearrangements, raising intriguing questions about the mechanisms involved. previous studies in great apes have revealed that rearranged chromosomes presented significantly lower recombination rates than do chromosomes that have been maintained collinear since a common ancestor, and this was related to the lineage in which they become fixed  <cit> . importantly, inverted regions had lower recombination rates than did collinear and non-inverted regions, independently of the effect of centromeres  <cit> . although at this stage it would be premature to argue about the evolutionary forces behind this pattern, our results highlight the importance of the study of recombination framed by the evolutionary history of chromosomes and, in greater extent, genomes. incorporating more chromosomes into the experimental study would be necessary to detect a clearer genomic effect of the inversions in the distribution of recombination patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic rearrangements might play an important role in local adaptation and species divergence by the modification of both the structure and regulation of genes located near the affected regions. here, we provide a highly refined description of the chromosomal reorganizations and evolutionary breakpoint regions in the human and rhesus macaque genomes based on orthologous genes and genome sequence alignments. the high-resolution map of ebrs and hsbs defined in the macaque genome has revealed an interesting pattern: evolutionary breakpoints are gene-rich regions, with a significant functional clustering for genes related to the immune system. furthermore, and in light of our observations, inversions can induce a reduction in the recombination rate among the different alleles contained in the inversion, which could be favoring adaptive alleles. future comparative research on the effect of chromosomal reorganization on recombination as outlined above should be an effective means to enhance our knowledge of the role of genome reshuffling in evolution.
