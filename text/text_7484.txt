BACKGROUND
it has been estimated that there are at least ten times more microbial cells associated with our bodies than there are human cells
 <cit> . recent advances in high throughput, metagenomic sequencing approaches have facilitated identification of this diverse population of microbes at the genomic level. characterisation of this microbiome, led by the human microbiome project
 <cit> , has revealed that its composition varies widely between body sites and between individuals
.

the microbiome has a significant influence upon health. the majority of microbes are found in the gut and have essential roles in normal human physiology and immune responses
 <cit> . the composition of the gut microbiome is correlated with diet
 <cit>  and may be linked with the pathophysiology of bowel disorders
 <cit> , obesity
, atherosclerosis
, diabetes
 <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis
 <cit>  and neurodevelopmental disorders
 <cit> . inflammatory bowel conditions have been linked with the intestinal fungal community
 <cit> .

most metagenomic studies to date have involved isolation of dna from external body sites or from the respiratory or digestive tracts, with fecal samples being the most commonly used source for investigation of the gut microbiome. certain small rnas are stable in the blood and in particular micrornas have been widely studied as potential predictors of disease
 <cit> . however, we and others
 have observed the existence of additional, exogenous small rnas of potential microbial origin. indeed, wang et al. have documented the existence of rna from bacteria and fungi in plasma and suggested that they may serve as signaling molecules or indicators of human health
 <cit> . the origin of these small rnas is unclear, but they are almost certainly derived from microbes inhabiting the gut or respiratory tract, rather than from viable microbes within the circulation. nonetheless, it seems likely that the subset of the total human microbiome which contributes to these blood-borne small rnas is linked with health status. the ability to reliably determine the composition of this microbiome from the sequences of the small rnas present in a blood sample could form the basis of an extremely valuable diagnostic test.

the aim of this study was to construct a profile of the microbiome from which the exogenous small rnas present in human plasma are derived. the merging of overlapping sequences to generate contigs facilitated identification of the origin of the short rna sequences. the microbiome profiles generated were consistent across  <dig> individuals . in addition to bacterial sequences, a large proportion of reads matched fungal sequences. to our surprise, the majority of these were assigned to the order hypocreales. this work has further demonstrated the feasibility of generating a microbiome profile from small rnas in plasma
 <cit> . the ease of obtaining blood samples will facilitate analysis of this microbiome in a wide range of physiological and disease conditions. these findings also raise the intriguing questions of whether these exogenous rnas have any functional implications and why sequences from one fungal order are so abundant.

RESULTS
rna was extracted from three plasma samples and small rna libraries prepared using an illumina kit. each library was sequenced on a miseq . the unique reads and raw sequencing data have been deposited in gene expression omnibus , accession number gse <dig>  sequencing data for three plasma exosomal small rna libraries prepared with a kit from bioo scientific were downloaded from geo
 <cit> . for one of these samples data from libraries prepared with an neb kit and an illumina kit  were also available. the strategy for analysis of the sequencing data was to filter out reads derived from human genes, assemble the remaining reads into contigs, annotate these by alignment to known sequences and perform a phylogenetic classification .figure  <dig> 
schema of the strategy for analysis of sequencing data. reads that did not align to human sequences or other known micrornas were assembled into contigs. these were annotated by blast alignment to the ncbi nr database and phylogenetic analysis performed with the gi numbers of the top resulting hits.



the proportions of reads annotated to human genes are illustrated in figure 
2a . as expected, a large proportion of reads represented micrornas, but remarkably, in the whole plasma samples prepared in this study, a similar proportion mapped to y rnas. y rnas are small cytoplasmic non-coding rnas that can be cleaved to form smaller rnas independently of the microrna pathway
 <cit> . the vast majority of reads  mapped to hy <dig>  with small numbers to hy <dig>  hy <dig> and hy <dig>  a smaller but significant number of y rna sequences were present in the plasma exosome samples. in small rna sequencing datasets from whole blood, which included cellular rnas , hy4-derived rnas were present at levels comparable to an abundant microrna
 <cit> . the differences in y rna abundance observed between studies can be attributed to differences in sample collection  and library preparation, which result in differing distributions of small rna read lengths . the small rnas detected corresponded to the 5p and 3p arms of the predicted secondary structure of hy <dig> . taqman small rna rt-qpcr assays employ a stem-loop reverse transcription primer and are therefore expected to be specific for the target small rna and not detect the full length precursor rna. therefore the low cp values observed with the assays targeting the most abundant hy <dig> sequences from each arm both confirmed the presence of these small rnas in plasma and suggested that they are indeed much more abundant than any individual microrna . to further confirm the presence of hy <dig> fragments, rna was polyadenylated, reverse transcribed with an oligo-dt adaptor and pcr performed with primers specific for the putative hy <dig> fragments. the size of the product amplified using the 5p primer was consistent with presence of the small rna template detected in the sequencing rather than full length hy <dig> rna .figure  <dig>

a significant number of unannotated reads remained in all samples. the randomly cloned dna sequences obtained in conventional metagenomic studies are typically assembled into contigs to enhance identification of homology with known genes. although this strategy would not be applicable to discretely processed small rnas, such as micrornas, we reasoned that it could aid detection of longer rnas which are processed to generate multiple small overlapping rnas. all the unannotated reads were therefore pooled and assembled into  <dig> contigs. for annotation purposes, the  <dig> contigs with significant hits  in a megablast search of the ncbi non-redundant database were assigned the identity of the top hit . the unnannotated reads from each sample were realigned to these contigs and the proportions of reads mapping to different taxonomic categories calculated . most identifiable reads were assigned to metazoa, bacteria or fungi. although some metazoan reads could be derived from food
 <cit> , many are likely to be misassigned due to similarity with human sequences.

a small percentage of contigs matched plant sequences, but due to the conservation of rrna across the kingdom viridiplantae, the top blast hits did not reliably identify their source, but rather reflected the composition of the database . however, in most instances the sequences were sufficiently divergent from human rrna to support the notion that they are derived from dietary plant material .figure  <dig>

the phylogenetic profile of the bacterial microbiome was remarkably similar between individuals , with proteobacteria being the most abundant phylum. this is consistent with an origin in the gut. the number of reads matching fungal sequences was higher than expected and of these, more than 90% in  <dig> of  <dig> individuals were from the phylum ascomycetes . remarkably, it was possible to further define the origin of almost all these reads to within the class sordariomycetes and order hypocreales . the predominance of sequences from the hypocreales is illustrated when the numbers of reads mapping to each fungal order are placed on a phylogenetic tree comprising all orders with at least one matching contig .figure  <dig>

for the  <dig> exogenous contigs represented by the most reads, the top 5% of blast hits  were analysed with the megan taxonomic classification tool
 <cit> . they all mapped to rrna,  <dig> of the  <dig> to fungal sequences, with the lowest common taxonomic rank for  <dig> of the top  <dig> being the fungal order hypocreales or lower . the relative abundances of contigs across the samples were very consistent. contig  <dig>  which mapped to hypocreales rrna, was the most abundant in  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals. notably  <dig> of the top blast hits for the  <dig> contigs were to the genus fusarium. the mycoprotein quorn is derived from fusarium venenatum
 <cit> . although it is intriguing to speculate that the sequences we observe are derived from quorn, it seems unlikely that all  <dig> subjects would have had this in their diet. in addition, although several contigs align very closely with published f. venenatum rrna sequences, they match even more closely to other species .figure  <dig>

the contigs assigned to hypocreales are extremely similar to the published sequences. for example, contig  <dig> has a similarity of  <dig> % identity over  <dig> nucleotides to hypocreales cordycipitaceae cordyceps gunnii 28s ribosomal rna . this contig can also be aligned, with lower similarity, to rrna from many other species. a region of contig  <dig> across which many orthologous sequences were available was selected and a multiple alignment made . the phylogram derived from this alignment illustrates that contig  <dig> is considerably more similar to sequences from several species within hypocreales than to those within malasseziales and even more dissimilar to the human rrna sequence . contigs generated from analysis of samples from the study by wang et al.
 <cit>  were also similar to fungal sequences and indeed some were identical to contig  <dig> for >700 bp .figure  <dig>

all the most abundant contigs fall within the mature rrna regions but the distribution of detected reads is very uneven . although the variation in coverage could be partially due to experimental bias  it is also likely to reflect in vivo abundances.figure  <dig>

discussion
highly expressed small rnas derived from y rnas hy <dig> and hy <dig> have been reported in tumours and high expression in serum suggested by rt-pcr
 <cit> . we also observed a small number of sequences matching hy <dig> and hy <dig>  but the presence of extremely abundant hy <dig> fragments, confirmed by rt-qpcr, was unexpected. our ability to detect y rna fragments as such a large proportion of total small rnas in this study may relate to practical details of the library preparation protocol employed, particularly the size range selected. y rnas form part of the rornp, which also contains the proteins ro <dig> and la, but their function is poorly understood
 <cit> . they are required for chromosomal replication
 <cit>  and are overexpressed in tumours
 <cit> . it has been demonstrated that double-stranded rna oligonucleotides comprising the stem of the y rna are sufficient to reconstitute dna replication in vitro
 <cit> . y rnas are rapidly degraded during apoptosis to generate fragments similar in size to those observed in this study
 <cit> . although it has been suggested that small rnas derived from y rnas may act analogously to micrornas, the formation of y <dig> and y <dig> rna fragments has been shown to be dicer independent
 <cit> . given the abundance of the hy <dig> fragments in plasma, it is an intriguing possibility that they may have some, as yet unknown function.

the detection of microbial sequences in plasma supports previous reports of circulating enterobacterial transcripts
 <cit>  and the most detailed study of these sequences to date by wang et al.
 <cit> , who performed extensive control experiments to rule out potential sources of contamination. however, the possibility that observations of exogenous rnas result from contamination remains a serious concern
 <cit> . spurious detection of such sequences could arise due to contamination during sample handling, library preparation or sequencing or result from errors in data analysis. it is difficult to envisage how contamination with identical sequences could occur in studies undertaken in diverse locations by independent investigators, ie as detected in this study and by huang et al.
 <cit>  and wang et al.
 <cit>  . in addition, analysis of data from the sequence runs prior to those reported in this study confirmed that they were not the source of contamination. in this study reads were assembled to try to improve mapping accuracy and reduce the computational requirements for database searching. the observation of similar mapping results without assembly of the sequence reads  supports the proposed phylogenetic origins.

the taxonomic breakdown of the originating organisms achieved with our contig-based strategy is in broad agreement with that reported by wang et al.; proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phylum in both studies, with bacteroidetes also commonly detected, whilst ascomycota was the most abundant phylum of fungi in both studies. however, our data suggest an even greater predominance of ascomycota and we can assign many of these reads down to the level of order . whilst members of this order have occasionally been reported as opportune pathogens in immunocompromised patients
 <cit> , they are more commonly plant or insect parasites
 <cit> , while hypocrea jecorina is a widely used source of cellulases
 <cit> . it is remarkable that the vast majority of fungal reads should be derived from a small number of closely related species or potentially even a single species. from where do all these sequences originate?

the composition of both the fungal and bacterial plasma microbiome detected suggests that the sequences do not result from contamination from the skin microbiome during collection of blood samples. whilst the human skin microbiome varies widely, it is dominated by the bacterial phylum actinobacteria 
 <cit>  and the fungal genus malassezia of the basidiomycota phylum
 <cit> . reads from actinobacteria comprised an average of  <dig> % percent of bacterial reads in  <dig> of  <dig> samples and only  <dig> % in the remaining sample. firmicutes averaged 1% percent across all samples, although proteobacteria were the most abundant . with regard to fungi, only  <dig> contigs  were assigned to malassezia. it seems unlikely that contamination during sample processing could result in such similar microbiome profiles in three independent plasma small rna datasets and across multiple library preparation methods.

small rna sequences have been reported to enter the circulation from the gastrointestinal tract
 <cit>  and pharmacological preparations of small interfering rnas  have been demonstrated to cross the gut wall following oral administration
. the gut therefore seems the most likely origin for microbial plasma small rnas. the human gut, in contrast to skin, is predominantly colonised by the bacterial phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes
 <cit> , and by the fungal phylum ascomycota
 <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that the gut is the source, but one would not expect the observed predominance of sequences from hypocreales. perhaps the niche occupied by these species within the gut predisposes them to uptake into the circulation. the respiratory tract is another potential source and indeed fusarium is one of the four most common pathogenic fungi detected, along with candida, aspergillus and cryptococcus
 <cit> . although some micrornas may be absorbed from the gut unshielded to survive exposed in the circulation for several hours
 <cit> , many are protected from degradation by association with lipids and proteins
 <cit>  and there is some evidence that the exogenous rnas may be similarly protected
 <cit> . indeed rrna fragments have been shown to enter argonaute protein complexes
 <cit> . differential stability could contribute to over-representation of certain sequences.

in addition to rnas of microbial origin, some sequences potentially derived from foodstuffs were detected. notably the greatest proportion of reads matching plant sequences were found in sample  <dig>  which was obtained from the one individual who reported following a vegetarian diet. although it has been reported that plant micrornas  are not reliably detected in plasma after ingestion
 <cit>  the possibility of genetic material from food entering the circulation is supported by the detection of plant chloroplast dna in the blood of cows
 <cit> . the unequivocal assignment of significant numbers of circulating small rnas to plant rrna in this study raises the exciting possibility that it may be possible to quantify diet from a simple blood test.

great care must be taken when comparing between studies because differences in sample collection and library preparation can have profound effects upon the small rna profiles observed and the proportion of reads mapping to y rnas or exogenous small rnas. nonetheless, the detection of these same small rnas in diverse studies confirms that they are a common feature of the circulation.

CONCLUSIONS
abundant fragments derived from the non-coding hy <dig> rna, but of unknown function, have been detected in human plasma. rnas from a diverse range of microbes are also present, but the majority of fungal sequences are from species in the order hypocreales. this raises questions about how these exogenous rnas reach the circulation, whether they are functional and why specific fungi are so highly represented. this work has demonstrated the feasibility of determining the microbiome that contributes small rnas to the blood. the profile of microbial sequences detected is almost certainly influenced by the composition of the wider microbiome, particularly in the gut. given the integral role of the human microbiome in normal health and pathology, it seems likely that knowledge of the plasma microbiome will be soon prove to be of clinical importance.
