BACKGROUND
velo-cardio-facial syndrome/digeorge syndrome , also known as 22q <dig>  deletion syndrome , is the most common microdeletion syndrome occurring de novo in approximately 1/ <dig>  live births  <cit> . tbx <dig>  encoding a t-box transcription factor, is located within the  <dig>  mb critically deleted region and haploinsufficiency of this gene is responsible for the congenital defects associated with 22q11ds  <cit> . tbx <dig> null mutant mice have malformations of the heart, thymus/parathyroid, craniofacial region, and ear that are similar but more severe, to what is typically found in 22q11ds patients  <cit> . previously generated bac <dig>  transgenic mice expressing 8– <dig> copies of human tbx <dig> also have developmental defects of the same tissues affected in tbx1−/− null mice, resembling clinical features of a recently identified 22q <dig> duplication syndrome  <cit> . ablation studies using tbx1flox conditional null mutants have proven to be indispensible for understanding the tissue and cell-type specific roles of the tbx <dig> gene  <cit> . coet, a transgenic mouse line with conditional overexpression of tbx <dig>  has previously been reported  <cit> . however, the coet mouse line does not contain a protein affinity tag on the tbx <dig> protein. we have generated a conditional allele targeted at the rosa <dig> locus for the purpose of expressing additional copies of tbx <dig> fused to a gfp reporter in a tissue-specific manner. we chose a gfp tag in part to detect live gfp as a readout for activation of tbx1-gfp in vivo and to use it for future biochemical or chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. tbx <dig> mutant rescue experiments demonstrate that tbx1-gfp fusion protein functions in vivo in a manner similar to that of endogenous tbx <dig>  the tbx1-gfp mouse allele provides a new gain-of-function model that is targeted to the constitutively active rosa <dig> locus; targeting tbx1-gfp to the endogenous tbx <dig> locus would simultaneously disrupt the normal function of the targeted allele . as such, our model works to activate 1– <dig> ectopic copies of tbx <dig> while simultaneously tracing cells with gfp, and should therefore be of high value in future experimental studies.

RESULTS
to generate the tbx1-gfp allele, we first generated a bacterial plasmid that expresses a tbx1-gfp fusion protein of approximately  <dig> kilodaltons  , corresponding to the combined mass of tbx <dig>  and gfp  . the tbx1-gfp fragment was inserted downstream of a triple polyadenylation  transcriptional stop sequence that is flanked by loxp sites in the pbigt vector  <cit> . the loxp-tpa-loxp-tbx1-gfp element was cloned into the prosa26pa vector for targeting to the rosa <dig> locus  <cit> , and electroporated into ww <dig>  mouse embryonic stem cells . we identified 5/ <dig> correctly targeted esc clones by southern blot analysis . clone  <dig> was chosen for blastocyst injection in c57bl <dig> females to generate chimeras for germline transmission.

to test the tbx1-gfp allele, we crossed tbx1-gfpflox/flox mice to foxg1-cre and pax2-cre mice  <cit>  and analyzed their respective phenotypes. both cre drivers have previously been used to inactivate tbx <dig> by tissue-specific recombination of loxp sites  <cit> . foxg1-cre expression overlaps with endogenous tbx <dig> expression in tissues such as the pharyngeal apparatus and otic vesicle   <cit> . in the study presented here, we show that foxg1-cre can ectopically activate tbx1-gfp in the olfactory placode, forebrain, and optic vesicle resulting in morphological defects of these tissues during development . in addition, by e <dig> , foxg1-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants display thymic aplasia likely due to overexpression of tbx1-gfp in the 3rd pharyngeal pouch, and abnormal formation of the nasal prominence. pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants are perinatal lethal .

since inner ear and cardiac defects are two of the most prominent features in the tbx <dig> null mutant, we decided to examine those structures in more detail in the pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants and foxg1-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants, respectively. foxg1-cre and pax2-cre are both strongly expressed throughout the ov, from which the inner ear forms. both loss or gain of tbx <dig> function in the ov disrupts inner ear morphogenesis  <cit> . paintfilling of the inner ear in foxg1-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ and pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants at e <dig>  shows an enlarged endolymphatic duct  and common crus  that joins the anterior and posterior semicircular canals  . the utricle, saccule, and lateral scc are missing. the cochlea is hypoplastic with varying degree, but enlarged in two instances . this phenotype is very similar to that of bac <dig>  transgenic mice  <cit> ; with the exception that bac <dig>  mice still possess the lateral scc, and in most cases the saccule and utricle are present, albeit malformed .

tbx <dig> is also known to repress neurogenesis of the viiith cranial ganglion that innervates the inner ear  <cit> . here we show that in foxg1-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants, expression of neurogenic differentiation factor  <dig>  is nearly abolished in the viiith cranial ganglion, and highly attenuated in cranial ganglia v, vii, ix, and x . immunohistochemistry with anti-neurofilament confirmed loss of the viiith cranial ganglion and abnormal size and misguided projections from other cranial ganglia in foxg1-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants . in addition, we found that neurod expression is completely missing from the olfactory placode of foxg1-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants; a region where foxg1-cre is active and there is no tbx <dig> expression in a wild type context suggesting that gain of function of tbx <dig> in the olfactory placode leads to ectopic repression of neurod. these findings demonstrate that tbx <dig> could act directly or indirectly on neurogenic factors that are common to both otic and olfactory placodes.

examination of scc defects in the pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants using paintfilling revealed a delay in scc formation at earlier developmental stages . in the wild type, clearing of the fusion plates is visible by e <dig>  and complete by e <dig>   <cit> . in pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants, the fusion plates have not yet joined at e <dig>  although they appear to partially recover by e <dig>  . histological sections at e <dig>  confirm that the fusion plates in pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants remain attached to the periotic mesenchyme compared to control littermates . we examined expression of laminin and netrin- <dig>  a secreted protein that is related to laminins and promotes basal lamina breakdown  <cit> . we observed decreased laminin protein levels along the otic epithelium, especially along the site of lateral scc formation along with a corresponding decrease in netrin- <dig> mrna expression along the fusion plates in pax2-cre;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants . it is possible that tbx <dig> may act to repress netrin- <dig>  thereby modulating cell adhesion properties. complementation of these results occurred in tbx1−/− null mice in which expression of netrin- <dig> is expanded in the mesenchyme surrounding the ov . we did not observe expanded netrin- <dig> expression in the ov of tbx1−/− null mice, possibly due to the severity of the ov phenotype and subsequent absence of vestibular structures.

to test whether tbx1-gfp could rescue inner ear defects that occur in tbx1cre/- null embryos, we crossed tbx1-gfpflox/flox mice to tbx1cre/+ mice  <cit> . tbx1cre/- mice have been shown to recapitulate the tbx1−/− null phenotype  <cit> . when cre is expressed, cells from the tbx1cre/+ expressing domain are positive for gfp in a manner that represents the tbx <dig> lineage in the ov in embryos . expression of tbx1-gfp under the rosa <dig> promoter alone is not sufficient for direct visualization of natural gfp, therefore tbx1-gfp protein was detected using an antibody to gfp. since expression of tbx1-gfp is persistently driven by the endogenous rosa <dig> promoter, we expect the domain of activated tbx1-gfp to be more extensive than native tbx <dig> expression . immunofluorescence with anti-gfp antiserum demonstrated that there is no tbx1-gfp protein in the absence of cre expression in the ov . tbx1cre/+;tbx1-gfpflox/+ mutants did not exhibit gross morphological defects of the inner ear based on paintfilling , perhaps because one allele of tbx <dig> is removed by knock-in of cre. paintfilling confirmed that the inner ears of tbx1−/− null mice lack all discernible vestibular and auditory structures with the exception of what appears to be an enlarged ed . when a single allele of tbx1-gfp is activated in a tbx1cre/- background, there is rescue of the anterior and posterior sccs in all embryos, and partial rescue of the saccule and cochlea  . complete rescue of the null phenotype is not expected with constitutive activation of tbx1-gfp because temporal regulation of tbx <dig> is required for normal inner ear development.

the tbx1cre/+ allele was also used to activate tbx1-gfp in other endogenous sites of tbx <dig> expression such as the pharyngeal mesoderm including the secondary heart field . histological analysis of tbx1cre/+;tbx1gfpflox/+ embryos at e <dig>  showed normal heart development . genotyping of mice at p <dig> confirmed presence of live tbx1cre/+;tbx1gfpflox/+ mice in normal mendelian ratios . in contrast, mice that have both tbx1-gfp alleles activated by tbx1cre/+ are not viable , prompting us to assess the heart phenotype in tbx1cre/+;tbx1gfpflox/flox embryos at e <dig> . tbx1cre/+;tbx1gfpflox/flox embryos exhibited defects such as persistent truncus arteriosus  and double outlet right ventricle , all with ventricular septal defects  . overexpression of tbx <dig> has been previously associated with vsd in ~10% of bac <dig>  transgenic mice  <cit> . heart malformations can account for the perinatal lethality of tbx1cre/+;tbx1gfpflox/flox mice. we wanted to compare the protein expression levels of the tbx1-gfp fusion protein activated in the tbx <dig> domain compared to endogenous tbx <dig> protein. to do this, we performed western blot on tissue samples  and observed that the level of tbx1-gfp protein expressed from a single allele was higher than that observed for endogenous wildtype tbx <dig>  however, this may reflect the larger domain of expression of tbx1-gfp within the cell lineage that is labeled by tbx1cre/+.

next, we wanted to test whether tbx1-gfp could also rescue the cardiac defects that occur in tbx1cre/- embryos , all of which have pta and vsd   <cit> . analysis of tbx1cre/-;tbx1gfpflox/+ embryos at e <dig>  showed a complete rescue of outflow tract septation defects , although 50% still had a misalignment of the outflow tract resulting in a dorv . vsd was observed in all tbx1cre/-;tbx1gfpflox/+ embryos. it is not clear if these defects are due to failure to rescue the tbx <dig> null phenotype, or if they are due to overexpression of tbx1-gfp protein , even though protein expression levels as detected by western blot do not provide information about the functional activity levels of tbx1-gfp protein. it is also possible that failure of complete rescue is due to the fact that tbx1-gfp is expressed constitutively under the control of the rosa <dig> promoter and is therefore not subject to temporal regulation. activation of both tbx1-gfp alleles in tbx1cre/-; tbx1gfpflox/flox embryos resulted in more severe heart phenotypes including pta in 5/ <dig> embryos in addition to vsd  due to further tbx <dig> gene dosage imbalance.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have generated a new mouse model that conditionally expresses a tbx1-gfp fusion protein. we show that tbx1-gfp does not act in a dominant-negative manner and can functionally substitute for endogenous tbx <dig> during heart and inner ear development by partial rescue of heart and inner ear morphological defects in a tbx1cre/- null background. we cannot completely rule out deleterious effects of the gfp tag protein on the ability of tbx <dig> to act as a transcriptional regulator either via direct binding of dna or via protein: protein interactions as we have not directly tested this. however, ectopic activation of tbx1-gfp by foxg1-cre and pax2-cre causes morphological defects of the inner ear that resemble those occurring in bac <dig>  transgenic mice. taken together with the partial rescue of heart and inner ear defects on a tbx1−/− null background, it seems likely that the tbx1-gfp fusion protein retains functional characteristics of the endogenous tbx <dig> protein. as such, the tbx1-gfp mouse line provides a genetic tool that is amenable to probing direct downstream targets of tbx <dig> and identifying protein-protein interacting partners of tbx <dig> in vivo.
