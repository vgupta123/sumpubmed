BACKGROUND
protein quality control is an array of cellular mechanisms through which protein homeostasis is monitored and maintained. this process involves the refolding, sequestration, or degradation of misfolded polypeptides, which may be deleterious to the cell due to their propensity to aggregate  <cit> . they arise as byproducts of de novo synthesis or are caused by cellular stress, structure-disruptive mutations or simply, structural changes at the end of the protein life cycle  <cit> . proteins that are damaged beyond repair or are not longer needed are eliminated through proteolytic degradation. at the heart of this cellular phenomenon are energy-dependent proteases, which are in charge of polypeptide turnover. in general, complete degradation of target polypeptides is carried out by complex multisubunit proteases such as ftsh, the 26s proteasome, and the clp protease  <cit> . at the molecular level, these proteases form intricate barrel-shaped structures harboring the active sites. the substrate enters the proteolytic chamber through the axial pores and gets subsequently degraded by the action of a peptide bond hydrolyzing serine residue . however, many of these proteases do not recognize nor unfold their substrates directly. rather, they associate with atp-dependent molecular chaperones that deliver the unfolded target to the degrading machine  <cit> .

protein turnover in chloroplasts is a highly dynamic process. phase transition and senescence implicate massive protein degradation  <cit> . in addition, light energy constantly damages photosynthetic proteins  <cit> . that is why these organelles possess a full arsenal of proteases that keep in check protein homeostasis  <cit> . in particular, the clp protease is one of the most important proteolytic system in the stroma  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, it consists of two stacked heptameric rings that define the proteolytic cavity  <cit> . the rings were named p-ring or r-ring depending of their subunit composition. clpp3- <dig> conform the p-ring, while clpp <dig> and clpr1- <dig> are part of the r-ring  <cit> . apparently, substrate recognition, binding and unfolding lie on the chaperone partner, namely clpc1/ <dig> and clpd. these hsp <dig> chaperones can assemble into hexamers with a molecular mass of  <dig> – 600 kda  <cit>  and are believed to dock to the axial pores of the clppr core  <cit> . the fully-competent degrading machine is thus made of a dozen different proteins. the clp system is also found in bacteria; however, it is much simpler than its plant counterpart in terms of subunit type composition. for example, in escherichia coli, the clp system is made of the homo-oligomeric clpp protease, which can associate with the chaperones clpa or clpx  <cit> .

other clp proteins which may regulate the assembly and function of the clp system have been found. clps is a regulator protein which seems to be the substrate selector for the clp system in chloroplasts of a. thaliana  <cit> . clpt <dig> and clpt <dig> are small proteins exclusively found in plants. initially, they were annotated as nclpc-like proteins, due to their homology to the n-terminus of clpc. both were then identified as part of the clp system by mass spectra analysis of clp complexes isolated by “colorless native” gel electrophoresis  <cit> . they were found to associate peripherally to the clp complex and seem to regulate its assembly  <cit> . null mutants in either clpt <dig> or clpt <dig> do not show noticeable phenotypic changes from the wild type, while the double mutant is seedling lethal  <cit> . for that reason, a molecular approach is more appropriate to gain further insight into the function of these accessory proteins. here, we show that one of the clpt proteins  interacts with the chaperone components of the clp complex  and specifically stimulates the atpase activity of clpd. structurally, recombinant clpt <dig> exists mainly as a monomer in solution but can associate into dimers in a small proportion. our results provide experimental evidence that raises new questions about the role of this poorly understood regulatory protein.

RESULTS
expression and purification of recombinant clpt1
to produce clpt <dig> in a recombinant form, the sequence encoding for the mature protein was cloned into a pet <dig> expression vector. the mature n terminus was determined using the prediction tool chlorop  <cit> . structure modeling of clpt <dig> using swiss-model showed that the n-terminal end seems to be inaccessible to the solvent , so we chose to place the his-tag at the c-terminal end. clpt <dig> was expressed from a t <dig> promoter-based vector in e. coli and recovered by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography . the c-terminal histidine tag was removed by thrombin digestion. clpt <dig> was isolated to >98% purity and its molecular mass corresponded to that of the mature native protein . we also attempted to produce clpt <dig> using the same experimental approach. however, during the thrombin digestion step, a fraction of the protein precipitated and the remaining was digested by the protease. efforts to optimize cleavage conditions were unsuccessful. we chose not to characterize uncleavaged clpt <dig> as modifications at the c-terminal end  may cause artifacts in interaction assays with hsp <dig> chaperones, as was seen for clpa  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
purification of recombinant clpt <dig>  expression and purification of the recombinant protein clpt <dig> were evaluated by gel electrophoresis and coomassie staining. soluble extracts from uninduced and induced cultures were loaded in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. lane  <dig> shows the eluted protein after affinity chromatography and lane  <dig>  clpt <dig> after the whole purification procedure. molecular weight markers were loaded on lane 1; their molecular weights are stated on the left.



oligomerization status of clpt1
a recent report showed that recombinant clpt1/ <dig> and native clpts from stroma extracts assemble into dimers in gradient native gels run for  <dig> hs  <cit> . we used the milder sec technique to analyze the oligomerization status of clpt <dig>  two major peaks were detected . one peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 44 kda indicates the presence of the dimer species. the other centered at around 22 kda corresponds to the monomer. these results were confirmed by static light scattering of the eluted samples . peak integration revealed that the peak corresponding to the dimer species represents less than 5% of the total clpt <dig> population, which is in contrast with the previous work of sjögren and clarke that showed a clear predominance of the dimer species. in fact, monomeric clpt <dig> was not detected in that study. the effect of clpt <dig> concentration on dimer formation was assayed by injecting a 6-fold concentrated sample and a 10-fold diluted sample into the column, yet the amount of dimer did not change . also, dimer formation was not induced by changing some environmental conditions in the chromatographic run. we emulated some of the conditions used by sjögren and clarke in their experimental setup, for example by changing buffer composition, time of analysis and by using his-tagged clpt <dig>  either clpt <dig> or clpt1- <dig> were incubated with 45 mm borate buffer for 1 hr or three days at 4°c and analyzed by sec. again, no changes in the ratio of dimer:monomer was seen in any case . to rule out possible unspecific interactions of clpt <dig> with the dextran resin that could have altered a proper molecular mass determination, clpt <dig> was incubated for 1 hour in 750 mm nacl or 1 mm free dextran and subjected to sec under these conditions, but the positions of the peaks remained unaltered . it should be noted that, once formed, the dimers seem to be stable. collecting the small dimer peak and reinjecting it into the column showed that this time, the dimer peak represented more than 92% of the total clpt <dig> . the presence of two definable peaks suggests that both species are not interconvertible on the chromatography time scale  and implies that dissociation of the dimer is a slow process.figure  <dig>

higher order oligomer formation can also be detected by the use of circular dichroism by analyzing molar ellipticity changes with protein concentration  <cit> . the cd spectra of clpt <dig> showed predominant peaks at  <dig>  and 222 nm   suggesting a high degree of α-helix  <cit> . the ellipticity value at  <dig> and 222 nm followed a linear dependence with clpt <dig> concentration , indicating no relationship between clpt <dig> conformation and concentration. this confirmed our previous result that changing clpt <dig> concentration does not cause detectable formation of the dimer species. to further support our results that recombinant clpt <dig> behaves as a monomer in solution, its hydrodynamic radius  was determined by diffusion-ordered spectroscopy  . the rh of a globular protein is directly related to its size, according to the equation rh =  <dig>  n <dig>  Å, where n is the number of amino acids  <cit> . n for recombinant clpt <dig> is  <dig> so; an rh of  <dig>  Å was expected for a monomer. the experimental rh measured by dosy of clpt <dig> at 120 μm was  <dig>  Å, in agreement with clpt <dig> behaving mainly as a monomer.figure  <dig>

our sec data indicate that dimer formation is a rather weak process. for that reason, cross-linking assays were carried out to stabilize the clpt <dig> dimers. as controls, gst   <cit>  and e. coli ferredoxin   <cit>  were used. by this technique, dimer formation was clearly seen, reaching a 60% of the total protein population at the highest cross-linker concentration used . in contrast, dimer formation of gst was complete at a 50-fold molar excess of egs, while ferredoxin did not assemble into higher order oligomers at any egs concentration tested.figure  <dig> 
crosslinking assays. purified proteins were incubated with egs for 30 min at 25°c. after the treatment, samples were analyzed by sds-page followed by coomassie staining. gst and ferredoxin were used as positive and negative controls of oligomerization, respectively. all proteins were at 25 μm, and the fold excess of egs used in each case is detailed on top. molecular weights are depicted on the left of each gel.



interaction of clpt <dig> with hsp <dig> chaperones
specific aspects of the role of the clpt proteins in the assembly and modulation of the clppr proteolytic core is largely unknown, though previous work has shed some light into the problem. by homology modeling, it was proposed that clpt1/ <dig> dock to the axial pores of the clp complex, thereby blocking the interaction of clppr with the hsp <dig> chaperones  <cit> . thus, the question that remains is how the clpt proteins disengage from the complex, allowing the hsp <dig> chaperones to interact with it. one possibility we tested is whether the chaperones themselves could aid in this process. first, a possible interaction of clpt <dig> with recombinant clpc <dig> and clpd was analyzed by sec to test whether the migration of clpt <dig> through the column was altered. if clpt <dig> interacts with the chaperone hexamers, then it would be detected in an elution volume corresponding to a mass range of 500–600 kda. we have previously used this approach to show the association of clpc <dig> hexamers with transit peptide-containing proteins  <cit> . yet, no association was found between clpt <dig> and clpc <dig> or clpd by this technique , as no clpt <dig> could be detected in the 500–600 kda mass range.

it could be possible that lack of binding was due to fast dissociation of the complex. then, it could get undetected by sec since each run is over 1 hour long. for that reason, we established a much faster, ultrafiltration-based strategy . clpt <dig> is a 22 kda protein; so, when applied to a concentrator equipped with a 50 kda cut-off membrane, it should pass freely through the membrane and should be detected in the permeate. to test this hypothesis, clpt <dig> was subjected to a 30 seconds centrifugation step in a vivaspin  <dig> concentrator to allow half of the solution to pass through the membrane. next, aliquots were taken from the permeate and the retentate and subjected to sds-page followed by coomassie staining. the amount of protein present in both fractions was quantified by densitometry of the gels. as expected, approximately 50% of clpt <dig> was found in the permeate while the remainder was found in the retentate . this was also true for the green fluorescent protein , which was used as a control. on the contrary, applying clpc <dig> or clpd  to the concentrator and using the same centrifugation conditions revealed that both proteins were completely retained . in another set of experiments, clpt <dig> was applied to the concentrator in the presence of either clpc <dig> or clpd and 5 mm mgatp and centrifuged briefly as before. under these conditions, clpt <dig> was retained in the retentate containing the chaperones by more than 75% , indicating a physical interaction with the hsp <dig> proteins. on the other hand, subjecting gfp to the same experimental setup did not alter its migration through the membrane, which shows that retention of clpt <dig> by the chaperones was protein specific. in some cases, protein precipitation or aggregation can occur during ultrafiltration. to exclude that these processes were not the reason for the retention of clpt <dig>  retentates were subjected to centrifugation followed by sec. in all cases, clpt <dig> and the hsp <dig> chaperones remained soluble and maintained their migration profile after the ultrafiltration experiments .figure  <dig>

. clpt <dig> was incubated for 10 min with the chaperones clpc <dig>  and clpd  in the presence of 5 mm atp and subjected to ultrafiltration for 30 s. the experimental setup is shown in . the permeate  and the retentate  were collected and analyzed by sds-page. gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue. gfp was used as a control. the amount of each protein was quantified by gel densitometry using the software gelpro and plotted as a bar chart . experiments were performed in triplicate; the pictures show a representative result. bands were cropped from the complete gel image for the sake of clarity. this image is provided in the additional file 2: figure s <dig> 



hsp <dig> atpase activity modulation by clpt1
as clpt <dig> associated with clpc <dig> and clpd, we tested if it could also modify their atpase activity. both chaperones have a basal atpase activity that can be followed by the malachite green method. clpt <dig> was incubated with either chaperone in different molar ratios ranging from approximately  <dig> : <dig> to 6: <dig> . the atpase activity of clpc <dig> was not altered by the presence of clpt <dig> at any concentration tested. however, the atpase activity of clpd was activated in a concentration dependent manner, reaching a maximal activation of >50% at a 1: <dig> molar ratio . interestingly, atpase activity did not plateau after this point but decreased at higher molar excess of clpt <dig>  lowering to the basal value at a 6: <dig> ratio.figure  <dig> 
influence of clpt <dig> in the atpase activity of clpc <dig> and clpd. release of inorganic phosphate was monitored spectrophotometrically by the malachite green method. the% activity of each chaperone in the presence of varying amounts of clpt <dig> was calculated as . the% activity is plotted as a function of the log/ molar ratio. the additional axes on the right show the scale of specific activity of clpc <dig> and clpd. the experiments were performed in triplicate.



the km and vmax of clpd in the absence and presence of clpt <dig> at a 1: <dig> molar ratio were determined. as we previously observed, the atpase activity of clpd did not reach complete saturation within the atp concentration range used for the analysis  <cit> . the kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the data points . the km and vmax of clpd in the absence of clpt <dig> were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  nmol/, and those of clpd in the presence of clpt <dig> at a 1: <dig> molar ratio  were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  nmol/ respectively. the data reveals that clpt <dig> induced an increase on the vmax and the km, albeit to a lesser extent. this observation can be taken as an indication that clpt <dig> is producing some structural variation on clpd, which may change the energy barriers that govern the rate of atp hydrolysis. an uncoupling between atp hydrolysis and the chaperone function  may account for that change.

discussion
the chloroplastic clp protease has been regarded as a constitutive housekeeping enzyme  <cit> . as such, the protein levels of its constituents remain constant in both normal and stressful conditions  <cit> . however, the needs for proteolysis are not expected to be the same under different situations. this led to the current notion that proteolytic activity of the clp protease seems to be regulated by substrate recognition mechanisms and interaction with accessory proteins and chaperones, namely clpt , clps and the hsp <dig> chaperones  <cit> .

two non-mutually exclusive models have been proposed that attempt to explain the role of clpts. sjögren and clarke found that the clpt proteins are involved in the assembly of the clp protease. they suggested that almost all of clpts exist as homogeneous dimers in the stroma and, after monomerization by an unknown mechanism, the monomers bind to p-rings with high affinity. clpt1/2-loaded p-rings then associate with r-rings to form the clp core complex  <cit> . on the other hand, peltier et al. modeled the structure of clpt <dig> using a three-dimensional threading tool  <cit> . for this, the n-terminal e. coli clpa domain was used as the template as it shows a notable sequence-to-structure alignment with clpts. neighboring clpp proteins in the p-ring form hydrophobic pockets that display remarkable complementarities in shape and hydrophobicity/polarity with loops present in the clpt proteins. by rigid docking of the backbones of clpt <dig> and clpp <dig> and  <dig>  peltier et al. placed the clpt proteins near the axial openings of the clp peptidase, though which the substrates enter into the central chamber. the hsp <dig> chaperones are also proposed to bind to the apical side of the peptidase, thus acting as entrance gates for unfolded polypeptides. as a result, the binding of clpt1/ <dig> would directly compete with the association of the hexameric clp chaperones to the protease. in this situation, the role of clpt1/ <dig> would be to modulate hsp <dig> chaperone docking and substrate delivery. this model was later revised by the same group in light of new experimental data. as explained, the plastid clpp/r protease complex in arabidopsis is asymmetrical, as it is made of two rings with different subunit composition. olinares et al. suggested that the clpp1/r ring is the docking site for hsp <dig> chaperones  <cit>  while sjögren and clarke showed that clpts only interact with the clpp3-p <dig> ring  <cit> . under this model, it is unclear why the hsp <dig> chaperones should displace clpt <dig> and t <dig> at all, since their docking sites are opposite to one another. however, it should also be noted that there is no experimental evidence that the hsp <dig> chaperones bind only to one side of the clp protease. in e. coli, it is clear that clpa binds to both sides of the clpp tetradecamer  <cit> . in this case, binding of clpt proteins to the axial pores of the clp protease would interfere with hsp <dig> association and their removal would lead to the completion of the clp/clppr degradation machine, as proposed in the earlier model of peltier et al.

our results add new evidence to the functioning of the clp complex but also call into question some aspects. first of all, we could not detect large amounts of clpt <dig> dimers by several techniques under various experimental conditions. significant amounts of the dimer species was only seen by stabilization with a crosslinker reagent, suggesting a weak association. dimer dissociation and subsequent availability of free monomers is a key step in the model of sjögren and clarke. in their report, recombinant and native clpt <dig> dimers were detected in native gradient page gels after  <dig> hs of electrophoresis. in this technique though, molecular mass determinations in extended runs were shown to deviate from real values, especially for proteins with molecular mass below 100 kda  <cit> . in addition, given the strong sequence-to-structure alignment of clpt <dig> with the n-terminus of clpa, similarity in some biophysical characteristics can be expected. lo and coworkers showed that the n-terminal repeat domain of e. coli clpa   has a cd spectrum very similar to the one we obtained for clpt <dig> and  behaved as a monomer in analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments  <cit> . taking our data into account, dimerization of clpts can be confirmed, yet more experimental evidence is needed to establish the true conformation in the stroma and the kinetics of dimer formation and their stability. it is important to keep in mind that we have used recombinant clpt <dig>  it could be possible that recombinant clpt proteins differ from the native ones in their ability to oligomerize, which was also noticed by sjögren and clarke. if in fact clpt <dig> forms stable dimers in the stroma, then dissociation by hsp <dig> chaperones could be the mechanism of monomerization, a phenomenon we cannot test with recombinant clpt <dig>  alternatively, since clpt <dig> and clpt <dig> are involved in the assembly of the clp protease, then their displacement by hsp <dig> chaperones could lead to the disassembly of the complex, a point that has not been addressed so far. it can be proposed that when proteolysis is not longer needed and a substrate has been fully processed, the hsp <dig> chaperones disengage from the core protease and remove clpt <dig> and t <dig> from the core, leading to its disassembly and inactivation. interestingly, the amount of stromal clp proteolytic core increases  <dig>  times in a clpc <dig> mutant  <cit> , which is line with our hypothesis.

in any case, a direct physical interaction between the clpt proteins and the hsp <dig> chaperones is necessary. hsp <dig> chaperones have protein remodeling activities; i.e., the ability to change the biological activity of a protein complex by modifying its structure  <cit> . we speculate that chloroplastic hsp <dig> chaperones may exert this ability in order to remodel the clpt proteins. the results from the ultrafiltration assays indicate that the chaperones can specifically interact with clpt <dig>  the same experimental approach was used to demonstrate the remodeling activity of e. coli clpa on repa, the initiator protein of the p <dig> plasmid  <cit> . oligomer dissociation of repa by clpa is an atp-dependent mechanism. in atpase activity assays, clpd atpase activity was increased by more than 50% with the addition of an equimolar amount of clpt <dig>  the shape of the activation curve is somewhat puzzling. if clpt <dig> acted as a substrate for clpd, then a hyperbolic curve would be expected. the obtained bell-shaped curve indicates that maximal activation occurs at a 1: <dig> molar ratio, but excess clpt <dig> somehow inhibits the increase in atpase activity. this suggests that excess clpt <dig> acts at a regulatory site, modulating clpd atpase activity tightly. clpt <dig> at a 1: <dig> molar ratio may uncouple the atpase activity of clpd from its ability to force polypeptides to the proteolytic core, which explains the increase in the kinetic parameters of the chaperone. in a previous study, we show that clpd possesses a much lower intrinsic atpase activity than clpc <dig>  <cit> , so an activity increase for protein remodeling may be necessary only for clpd. this may explain why clpc <dig> atpase activity was not activated by clpt <dig>  even though a physical interaction does occur.

the findings presented in this work reassure the notion that the activity of the hsp100/clp complex is regulated by means other than differential regulation of clp gene expression. many examples in other organisms indicate that interaction with accessory proteins serve this purpose. in bacteria, clps binds to clpa reducing its affinity for unfolded polypeptides  <cit> . in bacillus subtilis, the chaperone activity of clpc is modulated by the adaptor protein meca  <cit> . in addition, nbla is an adaptor protein that binds to clpc, bringing it to a close contact with phycobiliproteins  <cit> . this interaction is needed for proteolytic degradation of phycobilisomes in cyanobacteria. with our discovery of the interplay between clpt <dig> and the hsp <dig> chaperones, a new layer of regulation is introduced. further biochemical analyses will be needed to establish the mode of action of accessory proteins of the hsp100/clp complex.

CONCLUSIONS
we have purified the a. thaliana chloroplast protein clpt <dig> and demonstrated that it interacts with the hsp <dig> chaperones clpc <dig> and clpd and modulates the atpase activity of the latter. a thorough analysis of its oligomerization status in vitro showed that monomers are many times more abundant than dimers. the findings provide new insights into the role of this accessory protein in the regulation of the activity of the hsp100/clp protease complex.
