BACKGROUND
among the most devastating plant-parasitic nematodes are the sedentary meloidogyne root-knot nematodes , which are obligate biotrophs  <cit> . these parasites interact with their hosts in a subtle and sophisticated manner that is achieved by sustaining a constitutive dialog with select host cells in the vascular cylinder. these cells are the nematode feeding sites, termed giant cells , upon which nematode development and reproduction rely  <cit> . although the mechanism by which rkns establish the gc system is unknown, increasing evidence indicates that glandular secretions  injected into plant cells by the nematodes interact directly or indirectly with essential plant components, leading to the establishment and maintenance of nematode feeding sites  <cit> . two esophageal gland types are involved in producing effectors: two subventral glands and one dorsal gland  <cit> . other organs in contact with the external environment that produce secretory proteins include the amphids and cuticle. in the last two decades, several cuticle proteins from plant-parasitic nematodes have been identified, including some that are important for parasitism  <cit> . to ensure successful nematode development and reproduction, the nematode-induced feeding-site structure must be maintained for up to 6 weeks, which requires continuous suppression of the plant defense response throughout this period. suppression of plant defense genes after rkn infection has been demonstrated in microarray studies  <cit> , but the mechanism governing this suppression remains elusive. two major pathogen-defense-signaling pathways that have been extensively studied are the salicylic acid -dependent pathway and a sa-independent pathway that involves jasmonic acid  and ethylene   <cit> . these pathways crosstalk via a complex network of regulatory interactions, and are susceptible to continuous manipulation by plant pathogens for the promotion of virulence and disease production  <cit> .

a group of proteins termed fatty acid- and retinol-binding  proteins, secreted by all trophic groups of nematodes, have long been acknowledged for their potential function in host immunomodulation  <cit> . far proteins are of major interest for several reasons. i) they may play an important role in scavenging fatty acids and retinol for the survival of the parasite  <cit> . ii) they may induce localized depletion of essential lipids such as oxylipins, thereby compromising the host’s defensive immune response  <cit> . iii) they are located at the host–parasite interface  <cit> . iv) their structure is unique to the nematode phylum and is unlike that of any other known family of lipid-binding proteins  <cit> . together with their presence in multiple families of parasitic nematodes, these findings lend support to the notion that this nematode-restricted family of proteins plays a crucial role in host parasitism  <cit> .

the role played by plant-parasitic far proteins in negating the plant’s defense response was first studied for the potato cyst nematode globodera pallida far  demonstrating lipid-binding activity of gp-far- <dig> to linoleic and linolenic acids, and inhibition of lipoxygenase -mediated modification of these substrates in vitro  <cit> . more recently, a functional analysis of the role of meloidogyne javanica far  in rkn–plant interactions was performed  <cit> . the spike in expression of mj-far- <dig> by the parasitic nematode m. javanica second-stage juveniles  at 3– <dig> days after inoculation , together with its abundant deposition in the apoplast during the sedentary stages, suggests a primary role for this effector protein in the early and late stages of the host–parasite interaction. moreover, constitutive expression of mj-far- <dig> in tomato  hairy roots renders plants more susceptible to infection by m. javanica  <cit> . increased host susceptibility to nematode infection following the overexpression of nematode parasitism genes has been documented  <cit> , suggesting that an excess of some effector proteins enhances a compatible host–parasite interaction via modulation of the plant stress  <cit>  and defense  <cit>  responses. despite extensive research into the functional role of plant-parasitic far proteins  <cit> , little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility response in mj-far-1-expressing roots. to further clarify the increased susceptibility in a root line expressing mj-far- <dig> in response to m. javanica infection, we analyzed gene expression in roots of transgenic tomato differing in their constitutive expression of the nematode mj-far- <dig>  many of the genes that were differentially regulated in mj-far-1-expressing roots were tomato genes known to play important roles in pathogen-mediated defense responses. these responses involve physicochemical processes, such as cell wall regulation and modification, and biochemical responses such as biosynthesis and regulation of compounds associated with fatty acids and the phenylpropanoid-signaling pathways. our results provide insights into the transcription-regulation events, driven by mj-far- <dig> secreted by the invading nematode, that facilitate nematode development and disease production in the host plant.

RESULTS
transcriptomic data collection and analysis
our experimental system exploited the higher susceptibility of roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> upon m. javanica infection  <cit>  to characterize mj-far-1-mediated differences in gene expression during the m. javanica infection process. root samples of vector  <dig>  carrying the kanamycin-resistance gene  and mj-far- <dig>  lines overexpressing mj-far- <dig>  from in vitro-infected tomato root cultures were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai. equivalent root segments from noninoculated root cultures of both lines were used as reference root tissues. at  <dig> dai, the harvested samples of root tips or segments showed prominent swelling, an indication of nematode invasion and establishment . at  <dig> dai, mature galls on primary roots were hand-dissected . as reported previously  <cit> , accelerated disease development was observed for oe roots compared with kan roots, as indicated by increased gall incidence . to monitor the expression levels of differentially expressed genes  with disease progression, and to evaluate the effect of mj-far- <dig> overexpression, which underlies the increase in susceptibility, changes in gene expression were investigated by directly comparing noninoculated oe and kan roots . similarly, expression profiles of oe and kan roots were compared at designated time points after inoculation . in addition, noninoculated kan and oe root gene-expression profiles were compared to those upon inoculation of the same root line at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai . rna was extracted for transcriptome analysis as described in experimental procedures and rna-seq was performed on the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform, yielding an average of  <dig>  million high-quality reads per sample . paired-end transcript sequences were mapped against the international tomato annotation group  solanum lycopersicum protein reference version  <dig>   with soapaligner/soap <dig>  <cit> . gene expression was quantified as the total number of reads  from each sample that uniquely align to the transcriptome reference of itag <dig>  using the aligner soap <dig>  an average  <dig>  million reads from paired-end sequencing uniquely aligned to the reference sample, and represented an average of  <dig> % of the total reads  used in the bioinformatics analysis.figure  <dig>

mj-far-1-mediated differences in gene expression
to assess the regulation of tomato transcripts by mj-far- <dig>  differential expression analysis  was performed between inoculated and noninoculated oe and kan root lines. for the calling of differentially regulated genes, the false discovery rate  threshold was set to ≤ <dig>  and log <dig> ratio ≥  <dig>  the number of degs, both upregulated  and downregulated , increased with time after inoculation for both oe and kan root lines . based on venn diagrams , a total of  <dig> degs were identified in oe compared with kan root lines using fdr ≤  <dig> . the number of degs common to the oe root line alone and the oe root–nematode interactions is indicated in the overlapping portions of the circles. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in oe vs. kan lines for all inoculated and noninoculated samples. the numbers of upregulated genes in noninoculated oe samples and those at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai compared with the kan roots at the same time points were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the numbers of downregulated genes of noninoculated oe samples and those inoculated at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai compared with kan roots were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . a total of  <dig> upregulated and downregulated genes overlapped between all noninoculated and inoculated oe root samples . these genes might contribute to the mj-far-1-associated increase in susceptibility in the mj-far <dig>  root line. among this group were genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, such as those encoding the long-chain fatty acid-coa ligase  and the lipid-modification enzyme lipase . in addition, a group of hormone signal-related genes that were differentially regulated in oe roots included ja-related genes, such as a gene encoding a proteinase inhibitor , and auxin-related genes, such as the gene encoding indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase . other genes involved in plant defense that encoded the wrky transcription factor , a pathogenesis-related  gene , and a gene involved in the phenylalanine pathway  showed consistent differential regulation among the treatments . an additional group of genes that might shed light on mj-far- <dig> regulation of gene expression constituted degs unique to inoculated samples, in which a total of  <dig> upregulated and downregulated genes overlapped only among inoculated oe roots . this group included genes involved in cell wall modification and remodeling, such as those encoding expansin-like proteins  and cell wall protein  , hormone-related genes such as those encoding auxin-responsive protein  and gibberellin synthesis , a gene of the phenylpropanoid pathway encoding chalcone synthase  , and defense-related genes such as those encoding pathogenesis-related proteins . changes associated with fatty acid metabolism that were restricted to the inoculated root samples included genes encoding the fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase  and the nonspecific lipid-transfer protein  .figure  <dig>

principal component analysis and distribution of differentially expressed genes
the pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the significance of the correlation between mrna datasets of all eight samples using r   in the factominer package  <cit> . as shown by the principal component analysis , root profiles of noninoculated and  <dig> dai samples clustered with respect to temporal dynamics associated with nematode infection, whereas the effect of mj-far- <dig> overexpression was less important at these stages. the resulting dendrogram revealed small differences in the expression levels of degs between noninoculated oe and kan roots as well as between  <dig> dai oe and kan roots . at  <dig> and  <dig> dai, i.e., once nematode infection had progressed, root samples clustered predominantly in accordance with mj-far- <dig> overexpression, revealing broad, global differences in the expression levels of degs between oe and kan root lines . these results indicate that mj-far- <dig> is more important in defining a common transcriptome at later time points . in this analysis, the most variability in the data was accounted for by dimension  <dig> , while dimension  <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of the variability in the data. analyzing the distribution of degs and measuring the transcriptional changes detected in the oe vs. kan root lines demonstrated that most of the changes between the lines occurred at  <dig> dai when  <dig> genes were differentially expressed .figure  <dig>

functional categorization of differentially expressed genes
to obtain an overview of the processes that are altered during the early and late stages of the plant’s response to nematode infection as a consequence of mj-far- <dig> overexpression, degs were classified using mapman  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  . of the  <dig> probe sets,  <dig> corresponded to unassigned proteins, i.e., those with no known homolog in arabidopsis. all other probe sets were grouped into functional categories, among them transcripts associated with secondary metabolism , lipid metabolism , cell wall , transport , hormone , stress , development , and signaling  . probe sets that did not fit into any of these categories or fell into multiple categories were grouped as ‘miscellaneous’ . in this study, we specifically focused on groups that were associated with stress and defense, fatty acids, phenylpropanoids , and cell walls. these groups of degs were further studied in relation to the increased susceptibility observed in roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> figure  <dig> 
functional classification of differentially expressed genes in oe root line vs. kan root line  among all treatments as illustrated by mapman categories.




hormone metabolism- and fatty acid metabolism-related transcripts associated with mj-far- <dig> overexpression
analysis of the ‘hormone metabolism’ category across all time points revealed differential expression of genes related to et, auxin, methyl jasmonate and sa pathways in oe compared with kan roots . a detailed analysis demonstrated a remarkable decrease in the expression of et-related transcripts at  <dig> dai in oe compared with kan roots . these included transcripts encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase , gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase , and gibberellin 20-oxidase  <dig> , as well as aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase; expression of these transcripts decreased by  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in oe vs. kan roots at  <dig> dai. similarly, downregulation of auxin-related genes, such as the gene encoding the pin <dig> auxin:hydrogen symporter/transporter  by  <dig> -fold and auxin-responsive family protein  by  <dig> -fold, was observed, together with additional auxin-related transcripts that demonstrated strong downregulation in expression at  <dig> dai . with regard to sa-related transcripts, the  <dig> -fold increase in expression of salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase  in oe compared with kan roots at  <dig> dai might contribute to the observed root susceptibility  <cit>  .

given that far is implicated in fatty acid metabolism, we next focused on fatty acid-related signaling in oe vs. kan roots before and throughout the time course of inoculation. transcript analysis by mapman showed that the gene encoding the repressor jasmonate zim-domain protein  <dig>   was downregulated in noninoculated oe roots. jaz <dig> is a nucleus-localized protein belonging to the larger family of tify proteins  <cit>  that act as repressors of ja signaling  <cit> .   was observed in noninoculated oe roots; this protein might induce the ja pathway before inoculation, providing an advantage for rkn infection. at  <dig> dai downregulation of a 9-lox member, the loxb transcript , by 360-fold and aos  by  <dig> -fold was observed, indicating that changes in lipid metabolism are an early response to nematode inoculation. at  <dig> dai additional downregulation of 9-lox  in oe roots compared with kan roots was observed; although these mentioned isoforms are not known to be involved in ja biosynthesis, their product might be active in local and systemic defense mechanisms against pathogens  <cit>  . at  <dig> dai significant upregulation of 9-lox  and aos  transcripts was observed in inoculated oe roots compared with the noninoculated control . differential expression of ja- and fatty acid-related transcripts solely as a consequence of nematode infection was studied by analyzing the kan control roots. inoculated kan roots at  <dig> and  <dig> dai showed downregulation of the 9-lox gene family as loxb , and of the 13-lox family  and as loxd  . similarly, the genes encoding aos  and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase  <dig>  were downregulated. upregulation of genes encoding hydroperoxide lyase  , 9-lox transcripts similar to arabidopsis lox <dig> , and lox <dig> , aos  and opr <dig>   was observed. similar to noninoculated oe samples, in kan control roots at  <dig> and  <dig> dai transcripts similar to those of the negative regulators of ja signaling jaz <dig>  and jaz <dig>  were downregulated as infection proceeded.table  <dig>

given that the loxd isoform is involved in ja biosynthesis, we next studied the dynamic expression of loxd by means of a loxd promoter–gus construct. for these experiments, primers corresponding to the 5′ upstream sequences of loxd  were designed with reference to the recently released genome . promoter fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction  using tomato line  <dig> genomic dna as a template, cloned upstream of the gus reporter gene in the vector puc19_y  <cit> , and subsequently cloned in the binary vector pcambia <dig>  <cit> . transgenic hairy roots were generated in the background of tomato line  <dig> using the loxd promoter–gus construct transformed into agrobacterium rhizogenes. five positive transgenic hairy roots events were then infected with the avirulent m. javanica population. for the loxd promoter–gus line , loxd expression was conspicuous, but restricted to the vascular cylinder, in noninoculated roots . following infection, weak signal corresponding to loxd expression was observed within the vascular tissue at  <dig> and  <dig> dai , which corresponded well with the transcriptome results . at  <dig> dai, by which time galls had developed, extremely intense signal was detected within the gall, restricted to the vascular tissue associated with gcs . a similar phenotype was observed for all ploxd–gus transformed root events.figure  <dig>

differential expression of cell wall biosynthesis-, modification-, and remodeling-related genes associated with mj-far- <dig> overexpression
a distinct difference in the expression of genes showing strong or moderate association with cell wall-related activities was detected in oe vs. kan roots. this pattern was demonstrated by the high representation of genes belonging to the different cell wall subcategories, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  whereby transcripts belonging to certain subcategories are overrepresented among the degs at a specific time point compared with their frequency in the tomato genome. among these subcategories, a high representation of cell wall modification- and remodeling-related genes  and expansin-encoding transcripts was observed . the group of genes associated with cell wall-synthesis activity, such as the gene encoding cellulose synthase , and cell wall degradation-related genes, such as genes encoding pectate lyases and polygalacturonases, were also overrepresented . as noted already, at the early time points most genes belonging to these subcategories showed downregulation of the corresponding transcripts in oe roots compared with kan roots. however, several transcripts belonging to the different subcategories showed remarkable upregulation, in particular at later time points .figure  <dig>

to further validate the spatial and temporal expression patterns of cell wall-related genes, we used the gene encoding cwp  in the aforementioned promoter–gus construct assay. in noninoculated roots of the cwp promoter–gus hairy root line , no cwp was detected at any of the tested time points . interestingly, after inoculation, the lateral roots adjacent to the galls showed strong signal, which indicated induction of cwp by nematode infection . a similar phenotype was observed for all pcwp–gus transformed root events.figure  <dig>

the phenylpropanoid pathway leads to the synthesis of coumarins, flavonoids, phytoalexins, lignins, and lignans, all of which can contribute to plant defense. in roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig>  decreased levels of a transcript similar to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase   <dig>  and a transcript similar to 4-coumarate-coa ligase   were observed before nematode inoculation. the latter protein has a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of plant secondary compounds at the divergence point from general phenylpropanoid metabolism to several major branch pathways  <cit> . at  <dig> dai, upregulation of two transcripts similar to pal <dig>  and a transcript similar to pal <dig>  by  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, was observed. transcripts similar to cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  , a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis  <cit> , were strongly upregulated  in roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> at  <dig> dai. similarly, expression of the gene encoding chs , a key enzyme in flavonoids biosynthesis, was differentially regulated in all inoculated oe vs. kan roots , showing increased transcript levels at  <dig> and  <dig> dai followed by a decreased transcript level at  <dig> dai.

quantitative reverse-transcription -pcr validation of rna-seq data
to confirm the expression profiles obtained from the rna-seq data, qrt-pcr analysis was carried out for  <dig> genes selected from among the  <dig> and  <dig> common degs in oe roots compared with kan roots for overall noninoculated and inoculated samples, and for inoculated-only samples, respectively . quantitative rt-pcr was performed using rna isolated from infected and noninfected root samples of both root lines from the same batch used for preparation of the whole root transcriptome . the genes were selected to represent both up- and downregulated genes with log <dig> changes ranging from  <dig> -fold upregulation to  <dig> -fold downregulation in the transcriptome analysis. of the  <dig> genes tested,  <dig>  showed differential expression in the direction observed in the transcriptome profiling . for example, we confirmed the constant downregulation of the genes encoding long-chain fatty acid-coa ligase  and indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase , together with constant upregulation of the genes encoding nodulin family protein  and chitinase . only two probe sets that were shown to be downregulated in the rna-seq analysis, namely esterase/lipase/thioesterase  and auxin-responsive protein , were slightly upregulated in the qrt-pcr analysis at  <dig> and  <dig> dai. similarly, the gene encoding the fatty acid elongase 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase , which was shown to be upregulated in the rna-seq analysis, was downregulated in the qrt-pcr analysis at  <dig> and  <dig> dai . thus, overall, the qrt-pcr and rna-seq results were in agreement.

discussion
following deposition of effectors by the nematode through the stylet  <cit>  or other organs in contact with the external environment, such as the amphids or cuticle  <cit> , the question of how these proteins ultimately perform their function in the host cells remains to be answered. this is a complex aspect of plant–nematode interactions that are being dissected by several research groups  <cit> . a range of functions are attributed to nematode effectors, apart from reprogramming cell metabolism for the generation and maintenance of the nematodes’ feeding sites. a relatively large subset of effectors deals with the suppression of defense responses triggered by parasitism  <cit> . data to date indicate that, as with other pathogens, active suppression of host defense responses is a critical component of successful parasitism by nematodes  <cit> .

the involvement of nematode effectors in promoting host susceptibility to nematode infection has been reported for the cyst nematode heterodera effectors cbp, 10a <dig>  4fo <dig>  and 30co <dig>  and for the rkn meloidogyne incognita effector crt, whose overexpression in arabidopsis increases susceptibility to nematodes  <cit> . similarly, studies of the far protein from m. javanica  have shown that tomato hairy roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> are remarkably more susceptible to rkns  <cit> . the observed increase in host susceptibility conferred by successful pathogens could be the result of their overcoming pattern-triggered immunity, via suppression of the pattern-triggered immunity response by secreted effectors, leading to effector-triggered susceptibility   <cit> . even though the function of nematode infection in the manipulation of plant defense has been extensively studied, it is clear that nematodes target different levels of the plant’s immune system.

in this study, we aimed to elucidate the contribution of the protein mj-far- <dig>  which is secreted to suppress plant defense responses and to promote ets, by exploring the broad transcriptional events underlying the increased susceptibility observed in roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> relative to control roots. using the rna-seq approach, we observed that mj-far- <dig> overexpression accounts for the differential expression of  <dig> transcripts before and after inoculation. of these transcripts,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the oe vs. kan roots for all inoculated and noninoculated samples. this finding is in agreement with previous results in which nematode infection induced not only upregulation of the transcription of specific enzymes, but also downregulation of transcriptional, translational, and catalytic events  <cit> . collectively, these results suggest that the nematode might manipulate multiple pathways to suppress the host defense response. pearson correlation tests indicated that samples of noninoculated roots and roots in the first phase of parasitism, i.e., prior to feeding  when the nematode is initiating attempts to establish itself in the host, clustered predominantly according to the infection step. however, at  <dig> and  <dig> dai, during feeding-site formation and execution of the compatibility response, mj-far- <dig> overexpression had a greater impact on defining the root transcriptome of oe and kan lines . these results support our transcriptomic data, as global changes occurring in response to nematode infection are predicted to be similar in both lines, but the number and response level of modulated genes should provide a global overview of the changes that are attributable to mj-far- <dig> 

regulation of hormone signaling-related genes by mj-far-1
examination of genes encoding host biochemical pathways that have been implicated in the response to rkns identified several hormone pathways that might be subject to mj-far- <dig> manipulation. the observed downregulation of jaz <dig> together with upregulation of aos in noninoculated roots expressing mj-far- <dig> might induce the ja pathway and support nematode invasion and establishment in the first stages of infection. furthermore, the observed upregulation of ethylene response factor  <dig> might indicate that ja levels are increased because this gene is known to be activated by both ja and et  <cit> . coincident with the suggested upregulation of the ja pathway in noninoculated oe roots, a reduction in pal levels was indicated. these observations might support an antagonistic interaction between sa and ja in oe roots  <cit> . moreover, upregulation of salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase  at  <dig> dai might indicate a decrease in sa accumulation. this suggestion is supported by previous findings in which overexpression of salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase reduces sa-mediated pathogen resistance in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . evidence for the possible role of ja in promoting nematode development has been reported by bhattarai et al.  <cit> , who analyzed tomato mutants altered in ja signaling and concluded that an intact ja-signaling pathway is required for tomato susceptibility to rkns. similarly, in maize, mu-insertional lox3- <dig> mutants displayed increased attractiveness to rkns, and an increased number of juveniles and eggs were accompanied by elevated levels of ja  <cit> . more recently, in arabidopsis, the 13-lox member, lox4- <dig> mutant, characterized by increased levels of ja, demonstrated increased susceptibility to rkns  <cit> . overall, these results support our findings of increased ja signal promoting root susceptibility to rkns. following inoculation, several transcripts similar to arabidopsis 9- and 13-lox were differentially regulated in roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> relative to control roots. loxs are widely present in higher plants; they are important enzymes in the biosynthesis of oxylipins and in the plant response to wounding and pathogen attack  <cit> . although only the 13-lox pathway has been implicated in ja biosynthesis, other studies have suggested that there may be another as-yet-unknown pathway leading to lox-mediated defense responses  <cit> . the observed fluctuation in the expression patterns of lox-encoding transcripts suggests that nematode development requires the dynamic coordinated expression of lox genes in the proper order for successful establishment in a susceptible root. the altered expression of lox genes as a result of mj-far- <dig> in oe compared with kan roots is supported by results from an in vitro study indicating that lox activity was inhibited by far- <dig> of the potato nematode g. pallida  <cit> . thus, lipid-binding activity of mj-far- <dig> toward free fatty acids which, among others, are lox substrates might be involved in manipulating the plant defense response mediated by fatty acid signaling.

downregulation of several auxin-related genes was observed in oe vs. kan control roots, including those genes encoding indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase  and auxin-responsive gh3-like, which were downregulated in all oe root samples . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in general, global alterations of auxin balance accompany rkn infection  <cit> . moreover, the finding that all transcripts similar to jaz <dig> were downregulated at later time points after infection suggests that strict regulation of jaz <dig> is an infection strategy that enables nematode development. recent evidence indicating that jaz <dig> is not only a ja-responsive but also an auxin-responsive gene further illustrates the intimate molecular interplay between auxin and ja signaling  <cit> . collectively, these results suggest that mj-far- <dig> is involved in manipulating multiple pathways to coordinate feeding-site formation, protection from host defense responses, and maintenance of gcs.

regulation of cell wall organization-related genes by mj-far-1
in the present study, strong representation of degs associated with cell wall-related activities was detected. the extensive modifications in cell wall architecture  that occur in cyst nematode and rkn feeding cells are likely mediated by the activity of both cell wall-biosynthetic and cell wall-degrading enzymes. interestingly, most of the cell wall biosynthesis-, organization-, and modification-related genes were downregulated  in oe vs. kan roots, and particularly in noninoculated roots at  <dig> and  <dig> dai. these data further confirm the hypothesis that cell wall biosynthesis, modification or fortification is essential to the plant’s response to nematode infection. similar to other transcriptomic studies, rna-seq data indicated that the expression of many genes involved in cell wall extension and remodeling is altered following nematode inoculation  <cit> . for example, a group of genes involved in cellulose synthesis was downregulated at an early time point, whereas several transcripts were upregulated at  <dig> dai in oe vs. kan control roots . cellulose synthesis is expressed in the initial expansion phase of gc development. concomitant hyperplasia of root cells surrounding the gcs to form the visible gall also likely requires synthesis of new  cell wall  <cit> . it might be that upregulation of this group of genes at  <dig> and  <dig> dai reflects the accelerated disease development observed on the oe root line. similarly, there was impressive representation of expansin-encoding genes . expansins are encoded by a large multigene family. they are identified as wall-loosening factors and facilitators of cell expansion  <cit> . a previous study indicated that a decrease in tomato expa <dig> expression by means of rnai-transgenic root generation reduces the nematode’s ability to complete its life cycle in transgenic roots  <cit> . following gc formation, and possibly as a secondary response, division and expansion of cortical and pericycle cells around the gcs occur, causing the formation of galls. similarly, specific transcripts among the group of genes encoding pectin esterases, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase were upregulated in oe vs. kan roots at the later time points .

cell expansion, cell elongation, cell wall biosynthesis, and cell wall dissolution are all physiological processes that have been observed indirectly within nematode-induced feeding cells  <cit> . the differential regulation of cell wall biosynthesis- and modification-related gene expression at the early time point might facilitate nematode establishment in root tissues.

regulation of phenylpropanoid-related genes by mj-far-1
notable differences in the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were observed in oe vs. kan control roots at all time points . many secondary metabolites derived from multiple branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway, including lignins, isoflavonoid-phytoalexins, other phenolic compounds, and sa, are instrumental in the plant’s ability to mount a successful defense against invading pathogens  <cit> . a remarkable decrease in the expression of genes encoding enzymes at the initiation of the phenylpropanoid pathway, e.g., genes encoding pal and 4cl <dig>  was observed in noninoculated oe vs. kan control roots. pal  can be considered a control point for entry into the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> , whereas 4cl <dig> has a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of plant secondary compounds at the divergence point from general phenylpropanoid metabolism to several major branch pathways  <cit> . at  <dig> and  <dig> dai, four genes encoding different pal isoforms increased in expression, thereby suggesting increased metabolic flow into the phenylpropanoid pathway. increased pal enzyme activity has been noted in resistant tomato roots infected with rkns, whereas pal activity is depressed in susceptible tomato roots  <cit> . similarly, in potato, pal activity is higher in resistant plants  <cit> . it may be hypothesized that the decrease in pal expression before inoculation facilitates nematode infection, whereas the high level of pal at  <dig> and  <dig> dai reflects acceleration of the infection progress promoted in the oe root. two transcripts encoding cad <dig> showed increased expression at  <dig> dai; cad <dig> is a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis as it catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of monolignols. its expression may be the result of increased penetration and accelerated disease progression in the oe line . an additional important gene is chs, which was upregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dai and downregulated at  <dig> dai. chs is involved in glyceollin synthesis, which is known to inhibit oxygen uptake by meloidogyne  <cit> . the decrease in chs expression at  <dig> dai might support nematode infection. invasion of roots with rkns and cyst nematodes induces the flavonoid pathway in infection structures  <cit> , and flavonoids are hypothesized to act as regulators of auxin transport and accumulation during gall formation  <cit> . in flavonoid-deficient medicago truncatula plants, gall formation still occurred, although galls were smaller and showed fewer cell divisions  <cit> . in flavonoid-deficient arabidopsis and tobacco mutants, reproduction of several species of nematodes was not affected  <cit> . however, flavonoids did affect nematode behavior; for example, certain flavonoids acted as repellents for specific nematode species and inhibited their motility and hatching at millimolar concentrations  <cit> . although synthesis of flavonoid or isoflavonoid phytoalexins, deposition of lignin or cell wall-bound phenolics, and synthesis of other defense chemicals via the phenylpropanoid pathway are often characteristic of both the localized hypersensitive response and systemic acquired resistance  <cit> , we suggest that in oe roots, decreased abundance of transcripts associated with synthesis and regulation of defense chemicals derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway might facilitate nematode infection.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides evidence for the potential mediation by mj-far- <dig> of a complex defense-related response, including differential regulation of cell wall-, hormone- and fatty acid-related genes, as well as changes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. our results indicate that roots overexpressing mj-far- <dig> still mount a defense response against nematode infection; however, this rapid response might reflect the accelerated disease progress in oe roots upon nematode infection. while the direct effects of mj-far- <dig> might be related only to fatty acid metabolism, the indirect effect mediated by lipid signaling may drive other pathways that affect plant responses to nematodes. this study adds to our understanding of the role of mj-far- <dig> and may ultimately indicate novel pathways that are required for nematode establishment and parasitism.
