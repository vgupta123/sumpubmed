BACKGROUND
mao-a and mao-b, two isoforms of monoamine oxidase , are expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane. mao-mediated neurodegeneration can result from the formation of hydrogen peroxide  as a by-product of metabolism of aminergic neurotransmitters including serotonin and dopamine. if it is not detoxified by antioxidant systems such as glutathione peroxidase – one of the most abundant such systems in brain  <cit>  – then h2o <dig> can be converted by iron-mediated fenton reactions to hydroxyl radicals that can initiate lipid peroxidation and cell death. this is exacerbated when antioxidant systems are compromised, such as during aging  <cit> . the reduction in the efficacy of these systems may simply be aggravated in chronic disease states such as alzheimer disease  <cit> .

it has been demonstrated that inhibitors of mao-b, such as l-deprenyl and, more recently, rasagiline, are effective in the management of early symptoms of parkinson's disease in the clinic and in animal models  <cit>  as well as in patients with mild ad-type dementia  <cit> . both mao-b-positive astrocytes  <cit>  and reactive oxygen species   <cit>  have been found in the vicinity of β-amyloid  plaques. l-deprenyl and rasagiline, however, may exert some of their effects independently of mao-b as the neuroprotection mediated by these drugs is often associated with concentrations of the drug that are well below those required for inhibition of the enzyme  <cit> , and has been associated with activation of bcl- <dig> family members, interactions with the mitochondrial pore complex, and modulation of amyloid precursor protein cleavage  <cit> .

mao-a also plays a role in neuropsychiatric and behavioral disorders. the importance of this isoform is suggested by the aggressive phenotype seen in male mice deficient in mao-a  <cit>  and in males in a dutch kindred bearing a spontaneous mutation  in the mao-a gene  <cit> . similarly, maltreated children, whose genotype confers low levels of mao-a expression, more often develop conduct disorder, antisocial personality and adult violent crime than do children with a high-activity mao-a genotype  <cit> . relatively modest changes in mao-a activity/function can have important neuropsychiatric consequences as demonstrated by the fact that -harmine-labeled mao-a is elevated by only 34% throughout the brain of untreated depressed patients compared to controls, yet it appears to be the major contributor to monoamine metabolism in these same patients  <cit> . depression not only may promote cognitive impairment, but also may be a risk factor for ad  <cit> . not surprisingly, mao-a, which is often targeted for the treatment of depression, is also a potential risk factor for late-onset ad  <cit> . in contrast to irreversible inhibitors of mao-a such as clorgyline, reversible inhibitors such as moclobemide are better tolerated and have been particularly efficacious in treating depression  <cit>  and cognitive disorders  <cit>  in the elderly. in addition, they protect against apoptosis  <cit>  and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity  <cit> in vitro. inhibition of mao-a activity protects against striatal damage produced by the mitochondrial poison malonate and appears to rely on attenuation of dopamine-derived ros  <cit> , while apoptosis following serum starvation is reduced in mao-a deficient cortical brain cells  <cit> .

the nmda-subtype of glutamate receptor has been linked to massive increases in mitochondrial ca2+ accumulation  <cit> . it is interesting that activation of this same receptor has been linked to ca2+-dependent processes and pathology in  encephalopathic brains  <cit>  that correlates with a selective increase in mao-a activity  <cit> . the selectivity of ca2+ for mao-a is demonstrated ex vivo using brains from monkey  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and rat  <cit> , and is supported by the ability of the ca2+-channel antagonist nimodipine to block the selective increase in mao-a activity observed in senescence-accelerated mouse brain  <cit> . additional cations able to influence mao-a function include zn2+, which inhibits mao-a activity  <cit> , and al3+ , which activates it  <cit> .

these combined observations, in addition to the fact that cytoplasmic free ca2+ is elevated in aged neurons and even more so during neurodegeneration, such as that encountered during in ad  <cit> , certainly argue for examination of the relation between ca2+ and mao.

RESULTS
low millimolar concentrations of ca2+ increase maoa activity in ht- <dig> cells
mao-a activity in ht- <dig> cell extracts incubated with ca2+  was increased, with a peak  around  <dig> – <dig> mm ca2+ . ca2+ did not exert any effect on mao-b activity . mg2+ on its own did not exert any effect on mao-a activity, but it did inhibit the effect of ca2+ .

examination of the kinetics of mao-a activity in the presence of ca2+ revealed a decrease in km  , indicating that ca2+ facilitates the enzymatic reaction. vmax  remained unchanged , suggesting that ca2+ was acting via an allosteric mechanism . this was more evident on a double-reciprocal plot of the data: the slope  was changed , whereas the y-intercept  was not  .

the ca2+ ionophore a <dig> increases mao-a activity
ht- <dig> cells were treated with the ca2+ ionophore a <dig>  so as to examine the effect of increasing ca2+ availability on mao-a activity in living cells. fluorescence microscopy  confirmed a significant increase in free ca2+ as well as a selective 43% increase in mao-a activity  . mao-a protein expression was unchanged compared to control levels . the expression of mao-a gene  was also not affected by a <dig> treatment  . neither mao-b activity  nor gene expression  was affected by a <dig>  an increase in cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species  was observed, which was partly blocked by pretreatment with the mao-a inhibitor clorgyline  .

reduction of free intracellular ca2+ by overexpression of cb-28k reduces mao-a activity
ht- <dig> cells were transfected with either the vector control  or the prep-cb-28k expression plasmid . overexpression of cb-28k  reduced the level of intracellular free ca2+ and decreased constitutive ros levels . overexpressed cb-28k induced a decrease  in basal mao-a activity  . cb-28k overexpression was confirmed by western blot  and it did not affect the expression of either mao-a gene   or protein . neither mao-b activity  nor gene expression  was affected by cb-28k overexpression.

immortalized and primary hippocampal toxicity associated with the alzheimer disease-related peptide, aβ, relies partly on a mao-a sensitive mechanism
ht- <dig> cells treated with the ad-related aβ peptide  had significantly more free ca2+  and a corresponding increase in ros production  that was decreased by pretreatment with the mao-a inhibitor clorgyline  . hoechst staining, which labels all cell nuclei including those that have chromatin condensation , revealed a significant increase in apoptotic primary hippocampal neurons in cultures treated with aβ   . post-hoc analysis revealed that the effect of aβ  was greatly attenuated by pre-treatment with the mao-a inhibitor clorgyline   .

discussion
h2o <dig> is a natural by-product of mao-a-mediated degradation of amines  <cit> . the normal aging process and various neurodegenerative processes such as parkinson's disease  <cit>  and alzheimer's disease  <cit>  could well be affected by oxidative stress associated with enhanced mao-generated levels of h2o <dig> 

we demonstrate that the selective response of mao-a to ca2+  occurs in immortalized ht- <dig> hippocampal cells and confirms observations using brain extracts from monkey  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit>  and human . the effect of ca2+ on mao-a activity in our cultures appears modest; however, meyer et al  <cit>  have recently demonstrated that untreated depressed patients have levels of mao-a density that are only 34% higher than that found in controls. yet these same authors propose that this modest change could account for most of the change in biogenic amine levels observed in these patients. obviously, small changes in mao-a can significantly impact brain function.

while low millimolar levels of ca2+ are necessary to reveal this effect, the fact that mao-b activity remains unaffected clearly supports differences in mao-a and mao-b regulation. the need for millimolar concentrations also suggests pathological relevance. interestingly, the mitochondria can modulate cytoplasmic ca2+ homeostasis by accumulating ca2+ into the very high micromolar range  <cit> . furthermore, elevated ca2+ concentrations localized to microdomains may also represent unique means of modulating localized mitochondrial membrane and/or matrix function  <cit> , including the activation of dehydrogenases  <cit> . in neurons and chromaffin cells, mitochondria rapidly and reversibly buffer ca2+ during cell stimulation to help clear large ca2+ loads  <cit> . the ensuing overloading of mitochondria with ca2+ may be involved in several pathological conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion lesions, neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative diseases, where atp depletion, overproduction of ros and release of apoptotic factors lead to cell damage  <cit> .

using the ca2+ ionophore a <dig>  we now confirm that increasing free intracellular ca2+ well above normal levels selectively increases mao-a activity in living hippocampal ht- <dig> cells. the associated increase in peroxyradicals is moderately decreased by mao-a inhibition, supporting a contribution by the enzyme to a23187-associated toxicity. intracellular ca2+ levels can also be quenched by specific proteins including calbindin-28k , the predominant ca2+-binding protein in brain  <cit> . overexpression of cb-28k in ht- <dig> cells significantly decreased free ca2+ levels and significantly decreased mao-a activity. again mao-b activity was spared. the effects of both a <dig> and cb-28k occurred independent of any change in the expression level of mao-a protein , which, in combination with our demonstration of affinity changes of the mao-a enzyme in the presence of ca2+, suggests a functional modification of the mao-a protein itself. these combined data implicate a cb-28k-dependent, ca2+-sensitive component to mao-a function, which could be exacerbated when cb-28k expression levels are compromised, such as in normal aging or, more importantly, during neurodegenerative processes  <cit> . in support of this, an age-related loss of cb-28k immunoreactive basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in cortical regions and in the dentate gyrus  has been shown in several species including dog, mouse and rat  <cit>  and references therein). furthermore, in ad-related pathology, a substantially greater loss of cb-28k immunoreactivity is observed, with the diminished capacity of the cell to buffer intracellular ca2+ being considered as a core factor in the pathogenesis of ad  <cit> . this is corroborated by the ability of ectopic cb-28k to protect cell cultures against apoptosis, including that induced by the ad-related peptide β-amyloid  <cit>  and by the fact that alterations in ca2+ signalling can occur early in ad, well before any obvious extracellular aβ deposition  <cit> . furthermore, dihydropyridine ca2+ channel blockers, which are known to block the selective increase in mao-a in the senescence-accelerated mouse model  <cit> , may improve learning and performance in animals  <cit>  and may improve age-associated and ad-related memory impairment in humans  <cit> . as cb-28k and mao-a immunoreactivities are often co-localized and cells immunoreactive for both proteins are reduced during ad  <cit> , it is not unreasonable to suppose that a loss of cb-28k could facilitate mao-a-mediated h2o <dig> production in an increasingly toxic aβ environment, leading to localized cell death. treatment with aβ increases intracellular levels of ca2+  <cit>  , possibly through its effect on the ryanodine receptor  <cit> . a pathological contribution by mao-a in ad is further suggested by the accumulation of toxic metabolites of mao-mediated deamination in ad patients  <cit>  as well as by the ability of mao-a inhibition to reduce the ros production associated with treatment of ht- <dig> cells with the ad-related aβ peptide . primary hippocampal neuronal cultures are also particularly sensitive to aβ peptide  <cit>  and aβ-induced toxicity in these cells is also sensitive to mao-a inhibition . experimentation based on in vivo assessment of the effect of ca2+ on mao-a as well as a closer examination of the relation between ca2+/cb-28k and mao-a in ad tissues is warranted.

mao-a is a risk factor in ad and changes in mao-a activity parallel changes in the production of ros, e.g. h2o <dig>  given the neuroprotective role of cb-28k in human pathologies such as ad , in addition to our demonstration that the toxicity of the ad-related peptide, aβ, is sensitive to mao-a inhibition, we suggest that part of the oxidative stress associated with ad may rely on a ca2+/cb-28k-sensitive, mao-a-mediated mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of free intracellular ca2+ is positively correlated with the activity of mao-a, a mitochondrial h2o2-generating enzyme. the influence of ca2+ on mao-a function could potentially impact ad-related pathology, which is often associated with altered ca2+ homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.
