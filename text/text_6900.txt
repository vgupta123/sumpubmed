BACKGROUND
the use of recombinant proteins has increased greatly in recent years and as a consequent the development of techniques for their purification has significantly increased. the advantage of using fusion proteins to facilitate purification and detection of the recombinant protein is now widely recognized. more than  <dig> years ago it was discovered that many natural proteins have metal binding sites that can be utilized for protein purification. an amino acid sequence consisting of  <dig> or more consecutive histidine  residues can act as a metal binding site. if a target protein is produced in fusion with a his-tag sequence, it can be purified using a solid support that is covalently modified to displays a heavy metal ion like ni2+ or zn2+ on the surface. immobilized metal affinity chromatography  has been the most common technique used for protein purification and a his-tag sequence can be placed on either the n-terminal or c-terminal of a target protein by using commercially available vectors. recently, the use imac for protein purification has expanded due to the development of improved chelating agents that permit high-affinity coordination of metal ion by both the immobilized chelation agents and the protein  <cit> . resins coupled with nitriloacetic acid  are the most suitable solid support using metal ions with a coordination number of six, such as ni2+, because quadridentate nta occupies four coordination positions, leaving two positions available for tight, but reversible, interactions with target proteins  <cit> .

the biotin-avidin/strepavidin system is used in numerous biotechnological and diagnostic applications, primarily due to the high affinity of the proteins avidin and strepavidin to the small biotin molecule  <cit> . a small biotin tag has frequently been used for detection as well as for the purification of proteins  <cit> . this tag can serve as an anchor for immobilization of proteins onto solid surfaces. surfaces coated with avidin or strepavidin that efficiently bind biotinylated molecules are readily available, as are chemical reagent for biotinylation of certain functional group. however, the disadvantages of chemical biotinylation are that it often results in the inactivation of the protein and may yield heterogenous reaction product unsuitable for structural studies. it has been demonstrated that some natural protein are post-translationally biotinylated at a unique lysine residues by the catalysation of biotin protein ligase  <cit> . in escherichia coli, , there is only one post-translationally biotinylated protein, namely, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein   <cit> . thus, when this domain is fused to a recombinant protein, it will be post-translationally biotinylated in vivo by the endogenous biotin ligase of e.coli  <cit> .

it is well recognized that cancer can initiate autoimmunity  <cit> . circulating antibodies to autologous tumour cell antigens in cancer patients have been reported in several studies  <cit> - <cit> . although factors leading to the production of such autoantibodies are not completely understood, available data suggested that many of the target antigens are cellular proteins whose aberrant expression can lead to tumourigenesis such as her-2/neu, ras, c-myc, survivin and p <dig>  <cit> . among these the most extensively studies cancer-associated antigens is p <dig>  a tumour suppressor protein. autoantibodies to p <dig> in cancer was first reported in  <dig>  <cit>  and since then there have been over  <dig> reports confirming and extending this finding  <cit> . as there is generally absence of these antibodies in normal individuals and non-cancer conditions, there has been interested in using these autoantibodies as serological markers for cancer diagnosis. herein we described a simplified method to selectively immobilize cancer-associated recombinant antigens onto microtiter plates in order to detect circulating autoantibodies in cancer patients without prior purification process.

RESULTS
expression and purification of p <dig> fusion protein
after obtaining and confirming dna sequences of expression constructs, the established bacterial clones were cultured and activated with iptg in order to produce recombinant p <dig> protein antigen. western blot analysis revealed that the 6-p <dig> fusion protein reacted with both anti-p53mab and anti-histidine mab producing a band at molecular weight of  <dig> kda . bccp in fusion with p <dig> mimics the natural substrate for e. coli biotin ligase, thus the p53-bccp fusion protein is readily biotinylated in vivo. the p53-bccp fusion protein reacted with anti-p53mab producing an expected size of  <dig> kda ; however, this antibody also gave a reactive band at molecular weight around  <dig> kda, which is suspected to be a small un-tagged p <dig> protein as this band was not recognized by anti-biotin mab . in addition, anti-biotin mab appeared to react with a number of smaller bands less than  <dig> kda.

the 6-p <dig> fusion protein was purified by using metal-affinity chromatography. as shown in figure  <dig>  the fusion protein was purified to at least 90% purity when analyzed by sds-page. these results indicated that the purified full-length p <dig> protein could be used as antigen for the detection of p <dig> autoantibody to monitor the immune response against p <dig> in patients with cancer.

immobilized p <dig> recombinant protein directly from crude lysate onto microtiter plates shows a dose response of detection with a commercial antibody
wild type full-length p <dig> protein was produced in fusion with bccp or  hexahistidine-tag  <dig>  bccp mimics the natural substrate for e. coli  biotin ligase, thus the p53-bccp fusion protein produced from this  expression system is readily biotinylated in vivo and without requiring  any further purification step can be selectively immobilized onto avidin  coated microtiter plates . in order to selectively immobilize 6-p <dig> fusion protein directly from crude cell lysate, the nta derivative  was coupled to a microtiter plate and charged with ni2+ ions. crude lysate extracted from bacteria containing 6-p <dig> fusion protein was applied directly onto nickle coated microplate along with a purified 6-p <dig> fusion protein. the directly immobilized 6-p <dig> proteins as well as the purified 6-p <dig> fusion protein had a similar reactivity to anti-histidine mab and a similar dose response to anti-p <dig> mab .

reactivity of sera from lung cancer patients to an immobilized p <dig> antigen
although the immobilized p <dig> antigens reacted with a commercial p <dig> mabs in a dose response manner, human serum is far more complex than the commercial antibody. therefore, we tested whether the immobilized p <dig> antigens could be used to detect p <dig> autoantibodies in clinical samples. in order to identify p <dig> autoantibody producing sera, the purified  <dig> fusion p <dig> was resolved through sds-page, transferred onto a solid support pvdf membrane after which it was cut into small strips and probed with serum from each cancer patient, individually.

to test whether the immobilized p <dig> antigens could detect p <dig> autoantibodies in clinical serum samples, different concentrations  of crude cell lysate containing 6-p <dig> protein or p53-bccp protein along with their respective negative controls were applied onto ni2+-coated or avidin coated microplate respectively and reacted with patient's sera known to be positive or negative for p <dig> autoantibodies. this elisa experiment was performed in comparison with those utilizing the purified 6-p <dig> as an antigen. figure 5a shows that the purified 6-p <dig> protein antigen at each concentrations was able to clearly differentiate p <dig> autoantibody positive sera from those that were negative. in contrast, the crude cell lysate containing 6-p <dig> antigen directly immobilized onto an un-modified microplate failed to do so. sera from cancer patients were also subjected to react with 6-p <dig> proteins immobilized directly onto ni+ coated microplate. as shown in figure 5b, both concentrations of the immobilized p <dig> antigen could differentiate between p <dig> ab positive and negative sera; however, the lower concentration of  <dig> μg/ml was chosen for further investigations.

when the biotinylated p53-bccp fusion protein was used as an antigen and subjected to react with patient's sera. the result showed that human serum reacted strongly to the antigen free avidin-coated microwell and the irrelevant biotinylated protein -coated microwell . the reactivity was significantly increased in response to the amount of biotinylated p53-bccp contained bacterial cell lysate coated; however, the fold difference between positive sera and the negative sera were less when biotinylated p53-bccp antigen was used in comparison to 6-p <dig> proteins.

reactivity of sera from cancer patients to the 6-p <dig> protein directly immobilized from crude lysate correlates with reactivity to the purified 6-p <dig> antigen
to test reproducibility of the assay, control serum was prepared by combining all p <dig> autoantibody positive sera together; the pooled serum was then divided into small aliquots and kept at -70°c until use. control serum was tested twenty times on one plate to assess within-assay cv, which was found to be  <dig> %. this control serum was later subjected to elisa along with clinical samples, the result from separate assays showed the inter-assay precision was 10%.

to test whether the 6-p <dig> protein directly immobilized from crude lysate could replace the purified 6-p <dig> protein to be used as an antigen to detect p <dig> autoantibodies in clinical samples,  <dig> sera from lung cancer patients were detected for p <dig> autoantibody by elisa using the two different prepared antigens. in figure  <dig>  a significant correlation of the reactivity from patient's sera to the two antigens was demonstrated . although 6-p <dig> antigens directly immobilized from crude lysate showed a slightly higher od <dig> nm with patient's sera  than those using purified 6-p <dig> , it was not statistically different .

reactivity of sera from lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers to a directly immobilized p <dig> antigen
since there is a significant correlation of the reactivity of sera from cancer patients to the directly immobilized antigens from crude lysate to the purified 6-p <dig> antigen, we further tested whether sera from healthy volunteers would show different reactivity to this directly immobilized antigen in comparison to sera from cancer patients. the results are shown in figure  <dig> 

the average od <dig> nm from  <dig> non-smoker healthy volunteers with no known diagnosis of cancer was  <dig>  . the cut off value was calculated by combining the mean od <dig> nm of sera from healthy volunteers and 3sd, which was found to be around  <dig> . using this cut-off value,  <dig> of  <dig>  sera from cancer patients  possessed an od <dig> nm above this value. western blot analysis performed on sera from cancer patients with od <dig> nm above  <dig>  and sera from healthy volunteers showed that only sera from cancer patients with od <dig> nm above  <dig>   out of  <dig> cancer patient's sera examined) gave reactive bands at  <dig> kda . nevertheless, a larger group of samples needs to be investigated in order to decide a definitive cut-off value.

discussion
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are the most commonly used antibody detection method. this method involves coating the detection plate with the antigen of interest and allowing serum antibodies to bind to protein for later labeling and detection. the patient serum is in direct contact with the antigen so the protein used for coating must be sufficiently pure to avoid non-specific binding. for example, highly purified p <dig> recombinant protein is necessary for such an assay. in this study, a simplified method to selectively and specifically immobilize tumour-associated recombinant antigens onto microtiter plates in order to detect circulating autoantibodies in cancer patients without prior purification process was described. wild type full-length p <dig> protein was produced in fusion with bccp or hexahistidine-tag  <dig>  the bccp serves as an in vivo substrate mimic for e. coli biotin ligase, thus p53-bccp fusion protein produced from this expression system is readily biotinylated in vivo and without requiring any further purification step can be selectively immobilized onto avidin coated microtiter plate. in order to selectively immobilize 6-p <dig> fusion protein, the nta derivative  was couple to an ordinary carboxylated polystyrene microtiter plate and charged with ni2+ ions. although both of the directly immobilized p <dig> antigens from crude lysate bind to the commercial p <dig> monoclonal antibody in a dose dependent manner, strong background was observed when the biotinylated p53-bccp fusion protein was immobilized and reacted with patient's sera. one possible reason for explaining why human sera react strongly to antigen free avidin-coated plates or the irrelevant biotinylated protein antigen is that humans may have naturally developed antibodies against avidin and/or biotin. indeed, it has been previously reported that human sera contain natural antibodies to the egg-white glycoprotein avidin  <cit> . of  <dig> samples tested, all contained antibodies to different extents, mainly igg and igm classes, and were capable of activating the complement system. another problem that we encountered producing biotinylated p53-bccp was that a fraction of untag-p <dig> protein product was obtained. this stilled happened, although to a lesser extent, even after a careful optimization of the culture conditions. in addition, there appeared to be a number of smaller bands that can react to anti-biotin mab but not to anti-p <dig> mab, which can bind to avidin coated plate and thus interfere with the assay. although biotinylated p53-bccp protein can be selectively immobilized from crude cell lysate directly onto the avidin coated microplates, without having to go through the purification steps, the obtained strong background and the compromised sensitivity of the antigen to differentiate weakly positive serum from those that were negative suggested that this system may not be suitable for preparing antigens to detect autoantibodies in human serum. however, it is still of interest to investigate whether using a smaller part of bccp, as has been recently reported  <cit> , to enable biotinylation of the tumor antigen or using strepavidin instead of avidin will improve its reactivity.

in contrast, directly immobilized 6-tagged p <dig> protein onto ni2+-coated microplates followed by extensive washing with a series of buffers containing various concentrations of imidazole, was pure enough to differentiate the p <dig> autoantibody positive sera from those that were negative. in addition, the measured reactivity highly correlated with those obtained from using the purified 6-tagged p <dig> as antigen. the washing was comparable to those performed on nickel chelate affinity chromatography in order to purify 6-tagged p53; however, the immobilized antigens could be directly subjected to elisa without having to go through a dialysing process. moreover, the ni2+-coated microplate is reusable, although there was a tendency towards an increase in optical density ; therefore, this would not be recommended for a clinical test.

one of the potential problems of utilizing 6-tagged p <dig> antigen directly from crude lysate to detected autoantibody is ensuring reproducibility of the assay when a new lot of bacterial cell lysate has been prepared. in this study, we tried to ensure reproducibility of the assay by culturing and preparing cell lysate exactly the same way as the previous one and the new lot of cell lysate was subjected to react with various concentrations of the commercial anti-p <dig> mab  and some positive sera in order to titrate the optimal concentration of the new cell lysate to attain the same reactivity.

when reactivity of the directly immobilized 6-tagged p <dig> antigen from crude lysate was assayed with sera from lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers by an elisa using a cut off based on the mean od <dig> nm of sera from healthy volunteers with 3sd,  <dig> out of  <dig> cancer patients were positive. however, among these  <dig> patients only  <dig> patients  gave a  <dig> kda reactive band when assessed by western blot analysis. this discrepancy may be due to several possibilities. first, it is possible that the denatured conformation of p <dig> protein antigen presented in the western blot analysis destroied some recognizable epitopes that were previously presented when the elisa was performed. a second possibility may be that the cut-off value was based on only  <dig> healthy volunteers with a younger age and no history of smoking thus may under-represent the non-cancer condition. therefore, a larger group of non-cancer volunteers needs to be investigated in order to decide a definitive cut-off value.

numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer sera contained antibodies  <cit> , which react with a unique group of autologous intracellular antigens known as taas. although the mechanism leading to this immune response is not clearly understood, the target antigens are often cellular protein whose aberrant regulation and function could be linked to malignancy. the oncogenic nature of most taas has led the hypothesis that tumor associated autoantibodies are immunological reporters indicating aberrant cellular function associated with tumourigenesis. many investigators have been interested in the use of autoantibodies as serological markers for cancer diagnosis  <cit> , especially due to the general absence of these autoantibodies in non-cancer conditions. however, enthusiasm of this approach has been tempered by a low sensitivity. it has been demonstrated recently that the sensitivity of autoantibody detection in cancer patients was enhanced when using a panel of tumor-associated antigens instead of just one tumor antigen  <cit> . a simplified approach of developing a tumor antigen specific elisa to detect autoantibodies in cancer patients reported in this study might thus enable a larger panel of taas to be investigated. although detection of serum autoantibodies are shifting from elisa platforms to microarray slide formats, microarray technology requires sophisticated fluorescence detection scanners they are not currently accessible in most parts of the world. therefore, we believed the detection of serum autoantibodies by an elisa platform will still be widely used for years to come, particularly in resource limited settings.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated a simplified approach of coating directly and specifically a tumor-associated antigen onto a microtiter plate. although only one taa, p <dig>  was investigated in this study, our preliminary study showed that directly coated p <dig> antigen was able to identify p <dig> specific autoantibody producing serum and its reactivity highly correlated with those obtained using the purified p <dig> antigen.
