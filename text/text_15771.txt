BACKGROUND
soybean  is a major source of the world’s protein, oil, and animal feed  <cit> . the reference genome sequence   <cit>  comprises  <dig>  predicted protein-coding loci. the functions of most of these predicted genes have not been clarified. a mutant library with a high mutation density would be helpful for obtaining such functional evidence. soybean has a paleopolyploid genome and nearly 75 % of predicted soybean genes are present in multiple copies due to two duplication events at  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> . compared with diploids, polyploid species can better withstand higher mutation densities because of compensation by other genome copies  <cit> , as additional gene copies may mask the phenotypic effect of a mutation. however, rna-seq analysis of transcriptional divergence of duplicated genes by neo-functionalization has shown that approximately 50 % of duplicated genes were differentially expressed in soybean  <cit> . retention of the ancestral function by one of the duplicated genes and acquisition of a novel function by the other  <cit>  may result in phenotypic changes despite the high genetic redundancy in the soybean genome.

gamma ray is the most commonly used physical mutagens in plant mutation breeding  <cit>  and induces deletions  <cit> . one of the reverse genetics approaches, induction of point mutations by chemical mutagenesis, known as tilling   <cit> , has been widely used to discover the biological functions of sequenced genes and to develop novel alleles associated with specific traits in several crop species such as maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and canola  <cit> . ethyl methanesulfonate , n-nitroso-n-methylurea , and ethyl nitrosourea  constitute 64 % of all agents used for chemical mutagenesis . in soybean, ems is commonly used, and diverse mutant phenotypes have been reported . mutation densities of up to 1/140 kb detected by tilling have been reported in ems- or nmu-induced mutant population  <cit> . according to anai  <cit> , the mutation rate, 1/769 kb, which was detected from mutant population by repeated ems treatment of soybean increased from the mutation rate, 1/2500 kb, which was detected from another mutant population by a single treatment of ems.

a heteroduplex mismatch cleavage assay based on mismatch-specific endonuclease cel i is the most established method to detect point mutations  <cit> , but in this method the reaction conditions depend on the target region  <cit> . high resolution melting  analysis  <cit>  has been recently applied as an alternative simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for mutant discovery in tomato  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> , although its accuracy depends on the quality of pcr, resolution of the instruments, and the choice of fluorescent dyes  <cit> . some types of base changes  are more difficult to detect by hrm than other types due to the small differences in melting temperatures  <cit> . sanger sequencing  <cit>  is generally required as the final step of mutation screening to confirm the base changes and whether the mutation causes an amino acid substitution.

next generation sequencing  technologies provide accurate and rapid detection of mutations. ngs platforms such as roche  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> , sequencing-by-synthesis  <cit> , solid sequencing  <cit> , and ion torrent sequencing  <cit>  were released from  <dig> to  <dig>  the hiseq  <dig>  became the standard of high-throughput sequencing; it uses sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry. with the widespread use of hiseq  <dig>  illumina launched an alternative platform miseq, compact bench-top sequencers. sequencing with miseq, which is also based on sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry, has lower throughput  than hiseq  <dig> , but it is cheaper, faster, and easier to use  <cit> . however, accurate detection of single nucleotide variants  requires sequencing coverage of 20× to 30× for a diploid genome  <cit> , and re-sequencing of large populations is still expensive. an alternative, cheaper method is sequencing of pcr amplicons in targeted regions, so-called amplicon sequencing  <cit> . a combination of a pooling strategy and sequencing in the targeted region by ngs platforms has been examined  <cit> . the drawbacks and limitations of sequencing pooled samples by ngs include difficulties in distinguishing low-frequency alleles from sequencing errors, the need to adjust the dna concentration, occurrence of misalignment to the reference sequence due to high error rates, and short sequence reads  <cit> . nextera , a library construction method referred to as tagmentation, combines dna fragmentation and dna tagging in a single reaction of transposase-mediated adaptor insertion  <cit> . this method enables convenient and quick genomic library construction for high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . development of such cost-effective and high-throughput commercial products based on ngs technologies may simplify the retrieval of mutants with mutations in the target genes.

in the present study, we constructed a high-density mutant library of soybean, which provide a potential to yield new alleles for soybean breeding. an efficient method of mutant discovery in the library, which uses dna pooling and a new commercial dual indexing system for the amplicon sequencing by ngs, is described.

RESULTS
mutant library
using seeds of a japanese elite soybean cultivar enrei, we developed a mutant library with a high mutation density to identify useful novel alleles for breeding . m <dig> seeds were treated with  <dig>  % ems; m <dig> seeds were collected from four per m <dig> plant and bulked from approximately 2000 m <dig> plants, treated in a similar way to the first treatment in order to increase mutation density, and used to grow m1’ plants. the generation after second ems treatment was called m1’ to discriminate it from the initial m <dig> generation. populations were kept small and of the similar size in every generation. since contamination of dna from out-crossing plants critically impacts on estimation of mutation density and identification of mutant, out-crossing plants was carefully examined by simple sequence repeat  analysis. after all,  <dig> potential out-crossing plants were removed in order to preserve genetic integrity. the resultant library consisted of dna derived from 1536 m2’ plants;  <dig> of which produced m3' seeds. seeds from each line and their corresponding dna samples were stored as a mutant library.fig.  <dig> outline of the construction of the ems-induced mutant library. seeds were treated with a chemical mutagen . to increase the mutation density, bulk m <dig> seeds from approximately 2000 m <dig> plants were treated again with  <dig>  % ems and 8000 m <dig> seeds used to grow m1’ plants; the generation after the second mutagen treatment was called m1’ to discriminate it from the initial m <dig> generation. m2' seeds were collected each from 1762 m1' plants. a total of 1762 m2' plants were grown and used to extract dna. twenty-six potential out-crossing plants were removed, resulting in a total of 1736 m2’ plants. the resultant library consisted of dna derived from 1536 m2’ plants;  <dig> of which produced seeds. seeds from each line were stored with their corresponding dnas



phenotypic variations
phenotypic variations were observed in the following traits: albino, the density of leaf pubescence, flowering time, flower color, internode length, the number of nodules, maturity time, pod size, seed size, and seed color. some particular phenotypes distinct from wild-type cultivar enrei are shown in fig.  <dig> and listed in table  <dig>  the frequency of typical mutations, such as albino phenotype, was considerably higher in our library than in previously reported soybean mutant populations  <cit> . the frequency of the albino phenotype mutations  in a population mutagenized by using a combination of  <dig> kr gamma rays and  <dig>  % ems  <cit>  was similar to  <dig>  % in the present library, suggesting that mutations can be accumulated by repeated mutagenesis. the frequency of the dwarf phenotype in the present library,  <dig>  %, was higher than  <dig>  % reported by karthika and lakshmi  <cit>  for m <dig> plants mutagenized with  <dig>  % ems. the frequency of root nodule mutants,  <dig>  %, was also greater than  <dig>  % reported in the same cultivar by akao and kouchi  <cit>  despite their use of a higher ems concentration . the frequency of dwarf and semi-dwarf mutants in the present library,  <dig>  %, was considerably higher than  <dig>  % in a wheat population mutagenized with  <dig>  % ems  <cit>  and  <dig>  % in common bean   <cit> . similarly, the frequency of albino mutants,  <dig>  %, was higher than  <dig>  % in wheat  <cit> ,  <dig>  % in tomato  <cit> , and  <dig>  % in common bean  <cit> . the frequencies of other crop mutants with higher concentration  were even less than half the frequency compared to  <dig>  % ems in our library. thus, various mutant phenotypes to be potential target for forward genetics approach were frequently observed in the present library in comparison with other high-mutation-density mutant libraries.fig.  <dig> mutant phenotypes observed in the m2’ plants. wild-type: , ; mutant phenotypes:  early maturity,  long internodes,  many root nodules,  albino

protein, oil, and sugar content in seeds harvested from m2’ plants is shown in fig.  <dig>  in comparison with wild-type plants , distribution and average seed protein  and sugar content  in the library was significantly shifted toward higher values, whereas that of oil content  was shifted toward lower values . the ranges of protein content  and oil content  became considerably wider than those of the protein content  and oil content  reported in some japanese soybean cultivars and less than those of the protein and oil content  reported to  <dig> germplasm collection  <cit> . a negative correlation was observed between protein and oil content , protein and sugar content , and oil and sugar content . a strong negative correlation between seed protein and oil content is commonly recognized . generally, phenotype reproducibility of several m2’ plants with the high protein content, high sugar content and the low oil content was confirmed in their m3’ progenies . in contrast, phenotype reproducibility as for m2’ plants with low protein, low sugar and high oil content was unclear in m3’ progenies. in soybean seeds, 7s and 11s globulins comprise approximately 70 % of total storage proteins ; two qtls that determine the ratio of 7s globulin to 11s globulin have been identified  <cit> . although many genomic regions are related to the content of seed protein  <cit> , oil, and sugar  <cit> , actual genes that control the content of these components have not been identified yet. mutant lines with the maximal changes in seed protein, oil, and sugar content observed in the present study may be suitable materials for a smart forward genetics approach such as mutmap  <cit>  that allows rapid causal gene identification for the mutant by whole-genome resequencing of pooled dnas from segregating progenies with phenotypic differences.fig.  <dig> variations in protein, oil, and sugar content among seeds harvested from m2’ plants and its progenies. left histograms and right bar graphs indicate variations in protein, oil, and sugar content of the seeds harvested from m2’ plants and the progenies , respectively. high content plants  and low content plants  in m2’ population were re-evaluated at m3’ plants. in the left histograms, mean and variation for wild-type plants  are indicated by green ellipses and double-headed arrows, respectively



mutation density
to estimate the number of base changes per line,  <dig> arbitrarily selected mutant lines were re-sequenced. the cleaned short read sequences were mapped to the williams  <dig> reference genome assembly. the aligned read depth ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> fold; genome coverage ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % . common base changes shared by different mutants were treated as polymorphic sites between enrei and williams  <dig> and were filtered out. the resultant number of base changes in each mutant line ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  mutations per line . more than 90 % of base changes induced by ems and nmu are known to be g to a and c to t transitions  <cit> . as expected, those transitions were most frequently observed in the mutant lines , but the rates were lower and ranged from  <dig> to 77 %. the frequency of t to a and a to t transversions, the second most frequently observed group of mutations, ranged from  <dig> to 33 %. among  <dig>  base changes in all lines ,  <dig>  g > a and c > t transitions was predominant  followed by  <dig>  t > a and a > t transversions , 7626 t > c and a > g transition , 5981 g > t and c > a transversions ,  <dig> a > c and t > g transversions  and  <dig> c > g and g > c transversions . the transition to transversion ratio was  <dig>  . interestingly, the rates for g > a and c > t transitions, t > a and a > t transversions and the transition to transversion ratio were quite similar with that reported in tomato .table  <dig> mutations in  <dig> lines detected by using whole-genome re-sequencing analysis

**the distance between base changes was calculated from a total number of base changes per plant and the size of chromosome-scale assembly of the soybean genome 



on average,  <dig> base changes per line had the potential to cause amino acid substitutions based on the glyma_ <dig> annotation . among the base changes,  <dig> and  <dig> were missense and nonsense mutations, respectively. the distribution of mutations affecting the amino acid sequence on  <dig> chromosomes of two mutant lines, ent- <dig> and ent- <dig>  is shown in fig.  <dig>  the mutation density was estimated to be approximately  <dig> mutation per 74 kb , which was much higher than expected. so far, the highest density, up to 1/140 kb induced by either  <dig>  % ems or  <dig>  mm nmu, was reported in soybean  <cit> . the mutation density of a mutant library in this study was approximately  <dig> times higher than that of population. indeed duplicated mutations should be considered to be included in the present library due to ems treatment twice. nonsense mutation is known to cause gain-of-function allele as well as loss-of-function allele depend on the mutation position in human disease study . therefore, the present library rich in nonsense mutation has a potential to contain novel mutant allele and provide alternative useful phenotype exceed known trait variations. although too many mutations per plant may mask the intended mutant phenotype and hamper phenotype characterization, the present library with a small population size is practical for handling, screening, and maintenance; it will provide a tool for functional studies and yield novel mutant alleles for soybean breeding.fig.  <dig> distribution of mutations affecting the amino acid sequence on  <dig> chromosomes of two mutant soybean lines. blue and yellow lines on the chromosomes of two mutant lines, ent- <dig>  and ent- <dig> , indicate missense and nonsense mutations, respectively. the black line on the left of each chromosome indicates the pericentromeric region with lower gene densities than surrounding euchromatic region



mutant retrieval methods
two strategies tested here for the identification of mutants with amino acid substitutions in the mutant library are shown in fig.  <dig>  advances in ngs methodologies provide cost-effective commercial products for rapid identification of sequence variations across the genome. however, the traditional method based on sanger sequencing is still widely used to confirm the accuracy of sequences obtained by ngs. therefore, both strategies include mutation confirmation by direct sequencing as the final step . primers for hrm analysis need to amplify short fragments of up to ~300 bp within a target gene. according to instruction manual for hrm analysis , at least three repetitions are recommended to determine dna pool containing a mutation in pcr product. in the present study, the four original dna samples from the dna pool with a different hrm signature are subjected to a second round of hrm analysis or direct sequencing. if the identified mutation causes no amino acid substitution, it is necessary to return to the primer design step to amplify an alternative region.fig.  <dig> mutant discovery by using hrm and indexed amplicon sequencing. dna extracted from m2’ plants was preserved as the original dna stock in 96-well plates. the dna pool in a 384-well plate  was used for both methods. after a mutation was detected by hrm analysis, base changes in four original dna samples were confirmed by direct sequencing. if the mutation was found to be silent, hrm analysis and direct sequencing of other regions were performed. in indexed amplicon sequencing,  <dig> target gene regions  were amplified by long-range pcr. the amplicons of four samples were further pooled. the  <dig> samples were indexed by using a transposome-based nextera xt index kit. bulk read data for all  <dig> dna pools were obtained from miseq and mapped onto the reference sequences of target genes after classification of the dna pool by using indices. base changes at high frequency in many reads were treated as a mutation and were filtered by using a glyma_ <dig> gene annotation to exclude mutations that did not lead to amino acid substitutions. based on the information from dna pool classification with indices, the base change and the plant in which it occurred could be determined by direct sequencing of each of the  <dig> original m2’ dna samples. amplicon sequencing using ngs allows rapid and effective detection of dna pools containing mutations that cause desirable functional amino acid substitutions



using our second strategy, indexed amplicon sequencing, we analyzed seven target genes  amplified by long-range pcr in each dna pool . amplicons of four samples were further pooled; this arrangement is critical to simplify re-sampling for confirmation of the mutation by direct sequencing at the final step. dual indexing of the  <dig> pooled samples and sequencing library preparation were conducted with a transposome-based nextera xt index kit . advantages of the kit are the simple procedure for fragmentation and tagmentation. the ngs read data classified by using the indexes were mapped separately onto the reference sequences of target genes. base changes observed in more than 2 % of the aligned reads were treated as a mutation; the mutations were filtered by using glyma_ <dig> gene annotation to exclude mutations not leading to amino acid substitutions. since each dna pool with a candidate mutation can be identified by sequences of the dual indexes, it was possible to detect candidate mutations without a screening step such as hrm analysis. for plants with mutations that cause amino acid substitutions, the sequences were simultaneously confirmed by direct sequencing.

hrm
the results of hrm analysis of four coding dna sequence of glyma20g <dig>  , which encodes a transcription factor responsible for leaflet shape  <cit> , are shown as a model case in table  <dig>  twenty-six plants with base changes were identified in the mutant library. since the ems treatment was performed twice, duplicated mutations  derived from m <dig> plants are present in the library. after removal of such duplicated mutations, the mutation density in the library was estimated as at least  <dig>  mutations per 1 kb from the number of unique  <dig> mutations in the 1144-bp region. the  <dig> independent mutations were observed within the 1144-bp region in total, most of which were either g to a or c to t transitions except for a a to t mutation in a line ent- <dig>  among all  <dig> mutations, ten were missense mutations, but no nonsense mutations were detected.table  <dig> mutations in glyma20g <dig> detected by high resolution melting analysis

although hrm analysis detected  <dig> candidate lines for glyma20g <dig> in total , sanger sequencing showed that the mutations in  <dig> lines led to synonymous amino acid substitutions, which have no effect on protein structure. while excess amount of sequence confirmation by sanger sequencing will be required to confine the candidates to meaningful mutations, simple and cost-effective hrm analysis still provides an easy-to-use platform for mutation screening.

indexed amplicon sequencing
seven genes of a total length of  <dig>  kb were analyzed by indexed amplicon sequencing . the total length of amplicons was adjusted based on the sequence output of miseq v <dig> chemistry so that the read coverage for each sample would fall in a range between 50× and 100×. in addition to glyma20g <dig> described above, glyma08g <dig>  encoding a cytochrome p <dig> that participates in soyasaponin biosynthesis  <cit> ; glyma06g <dig> , encoding a transcription factor  <cit> ; glyma11g <dig>  a pseudo-response regulator family gene involved in photoperiod response  <cit> ; and glyma20g <dig> , encoding a photoreceptor  <cit> , glyma05g <dig> and glyma06g <dig>  which encode betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenases related to soybean fragrance  <cit> , were included in the analysis. the total read length and paired-end read counts were  <dig> , <dig>  bp and  <dig> , <dig> before trimming and  <dig> , <dig>  bp and  <dig> , <dig> after trimming, respectively. after de-multiplexing the bulk of the ngs read data into  <dig> pools by using the indexes, read mapping on the reference gene sequences was conducted separately pool-by-pool. the total mapped read length and count for the  <dig> pools were  <dig> , <dig>  bp  and  <dig> , <dig> , respectively. the read counts for each gene varied from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> depending on the length of the gene. however, relatively large variation was observed for read coverage depending on the dna pool and sample  as well as sample well location . for instance, the total read number for the shortest gene glyma06g <dig> was higher than expected, and total read counts per dna pool  and per sample  were the highest among the examined genes. in contrast, read coverage for glyma11g <dig> was the lowest for the number of reads per dna pool  and per sample . since one dna pool contained  <dig> samples, at least a read with a base change among  <dig> reads was required to detect one sample with a point mutation in a heterozygous state. sufficient read coverage is required to distinguish between sequencing errors and low-frequency mutant alleles because of the relatively high error rates of ngs reads  <cit> . the average read coverage per pool and per sample obtained in this study  might be sufficient for this purpose. however, the read coverage per pool was distributed non-uniformly across amplicons . read coverage varied by position and generally was lower in at-rich regions and at both ends of the amplicons. the percentage of base changes increased in such low-coverage regions because of an increased contribution of sequencing errors in the limited number of reads. although the threshold for calling a mutation was set to 2 % of base changes, not all base changes above 2 % were called as mutations. many base changes were excluded because the read coverage was lower than the required minimum read coverage , or because of their absence in either forward or reverse read. the base changes that met these criteria were treated as mutations .table  <dig> read coverage and mutations in seven genes identified by using indexed amplicon sequencing

a total of  <dig> unique base changes were identified in the seven genes by indexed amplicon sequencing . base changes at the same site were counted as one base change. in the results for several mutants, g to a and c to t transitions  and t to a and a to t transversions  were most frequently observed. most mutations occurred in one sample  but some were observed in two samples , there samples  and four or more samples . the large variation in the number of base changes  was due to the variation in the length of target gene regions from  <dig> to 7539 bp. the number of base changes per m2' plant were estimated by the base change frequency in each gene, and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  . similarly, the distance between base changes differed by the genes and ranged from  <dig> to 132 kb . the mutation density and the number of mutations per plant obtained by indexed amplicon sequencing were very similar to the results of whole-genome re-sequencing . among  <dig> base changes,  <dig> were missense mutations and nine were nonsense mutations . since 60 % of the base changes caused synonymous amino acid substitutions, which have no effect on protein structure, indexed amplicon sequencing can effectively confine the candidates to meaningful mutations. all nonsense mutations were confirmed by sanger sequencing ; most of them may be useful for functional studies. confirming the potential impact of missense mutations with the aid of the database of catalytic domain structures will be needed.

in the present study two strategies, hrm analysis and indexed amplicon sequencing, were used to screen the mutant library. although the overall mutation density in the library and individual plants was determined by whole-genome re-sequencing analysis based on  <dig> mutants, all of mutation for the targeted genes used for indexed amplicon sequencing remained unknown in 1536 m2’ mutants. to validate whether sequence variations identified by these methods provide reliable information about mutations in the whole library, the results of screening of five genes  were compared with the results of hrm analysis . in addition to the results for glyma20g <dig> , several regions of the four genes were analyzed by hrm. all  <dig> base changes obtained from two methods were confirmed by sanger sequencing as the final step. hrm analysis detected  <dig>  % of the  <dig> base changes, whereas indexed amplicon sequencing identified  <dig>  %. most sequence variations observed in the ngs reads by indexed amplicon sequencing reflect mutations well in the library in comparison with the hrm analysis data. the failure of indexed amplicon sequencing to detect the remaining 10 % of mutations was mainly due to low read depth and a uniform threshold for calling a mutation. these parameters may affect the discovery of mutations. therefore, adjustment threshold for calling a mutation and increasing the read depth in samples is required for each gene and can improve consistency. the reasons for the lower discovery rate by hrm analysis seem to be that pooling four dna samples is not suitable for any target regions and/or that a to t transversions are difficult to detect by hrm analysis due to their small differences in tm  <cit> .table  <dig> comparison of mutation detection by high resolution melting analysis and indexed amplicon sequencing



a longer sequence range of indexed amplicon sequencing in comparison with hrm can be scanned all at once. multiple gene copies impede mutation discovery in polyploid plants because it is difficult to design specific primers that can identify polymorphisms among copies of the same gene  <cit> . in contrast to hrm, in the proposed method of indexed amplicon sequencing it is not difficult to find specific primer pairs that can amplify a specific pcr amplicon because the choice of the target region is very flexible. furthermore, the proposed method allows one to skip screening steps because it uses dna pooling and a commercial dual indexing system, which enables simple and effective detection of plants with functional mutation and can be used as an alternative method for mutant screening. since enlargement of present library toward  <dig> lines are currently underway, severe adjustment of balance between number of target genes, the sequence range, number of indices and pooling individuals will be required to screen more mutants in the near future. further advances in detection sensitivity which allow the detection of single molecules by third-generation sequencing is already described  <cit> , but this technology still developing. the development of more cost-effective and higher-throughput whole-genome sequencing technologies would provide accurate data about mutations in all mutants in our upcoming library.

CONCLUSIONS
a soybean mutant library with a high mutation density was developed and various mutant phenotypes were observed at a high percentage in comparison with other previous soybean mutant libraries. a high mutation density  was achieved by repeating the ems treatment. since multiple mutations probably mask the mutant phenotype of interest, confirmation of a functional mutation by the progeny analysis of test-cross with a wild-type plant is required. the mutation density of our library is sufficiently high to obtain a plant in which a gene is nonsense mutated. thus, our mutant library and the indexed amplicon sequencing will be useful for functional studies of soybean genes and have a potential to yield useful mutant alleles for soybean breeding.
