BACKGROUND
the timing of reproductive events of perennial plants in temperate climates is largely conditioned by dormancy, a period of cyclic quiescence during the low temperatures of autumn and winter, which protects meristems within buds from the detrimental effects of cold and water stress. the pioneering work by lang  <cit>  distinguished the dormancy due to mechanisms intrinsic to the bud  from the inhibition of growth imposed by other organs of the plant  or by environmental factors . however, more recent reviews tend to emphasize the idea of dormancy as a state within the meristem, independently of the origin of the dormancy-imposing cues; and highlight the dynamic and quantitative nature of dormancy, varying in intensity according to intrinsic and environmental signals  <cit> .

the quantitative perception of environmental chilling is the major and best-known factor favouring the release of bud dormancy  <cit> . the extent of chilling needed is highly genotype-dependent and constitutes an adaptive strategy to the duration of the cold season under specific climate conditions. after fulfilment of the chilling requirements for dormancy release, a period of warm temperatures is needed prior to bud burst  and the subsequent developmental phases leading to fruit set, growth and maturation. both, chilling requirement for dormancy release and fruit maturation time have been described as two major limiting factors determining respectively the southern and northern boundaries to the geographical distribution of temperate species  <cit> .

recently researchers have increased their interest on the effects of global climate warming on plant phenology  <cit> . whereas some species are expected to advance their growing season due to the increasing temperatures in spring, others could delay or experience abnormal bud burst as a result of an insufficient chilling for dormancy release in winter. in particular, a delay in the beginning of the growing season observed in the meadow and steppe vegetation of the tibetan plateau from the mid-1990s has been related to the later fulfilment of chilling requirements  <cit> .

plant species cope with changing climate conditions by shifting their geographical distribution, with a plastic response of plant phenology to environmental changes, or alternatively through the natural selection of populations with dormancy, flowering and fruit maturation traits adapted to the new conditions  <cit> . the knowledge on the genetic factors affecting these phenology-related traits is scarce and fragmentary in woody perennial species, although recent remarkable advances have been reached based on the comparison with analogous processes of annual model species, the use of novel transcriptomic and molecular approaches, and the exploitation of the natural variability by means of mutant and quantitative trait locus  analyses. some of the most relevant qtl studies on reproductive phenology have been conducted in poplar and in species within the rosaceae family. in poplar these studies have focused mostly on bud set and bud flush in spring, resulting in some loci co-localizing with genes involved in light perception and abscisic acid  signalling  <cit> . in apple, qtl analysis of bud break date in flower and vegetative buds of two different progenies pointed to two major genomic regions controlling these traits in linkage group   <dig> and lg <dig>  showing numerous genes involved in cell cycle control  <cit> . blooming date and fruit maturation date traits have been frequently analyzed in qtl analyses of species from the genus prunus, such as almond, peach, apricot and sweet cherry  <cit> . in order to better characterize at the genetic level the physiological response of buds to chilling, some qtl studies included the chilling and heat requirement traits in their analyses  <cit> . in spite of the numerous genes proposed as putative candidates for the different qtls described in these reports, none of them has been functionally involved in dormancy or flowering regulation, with the exception of dormancy-associated mads-box  genes  <cit> .

the objective of this work was to identify new qtls and candidate genes associated to chilling and heat requirements in a prunus persica  batsch  population segregating from a sequential cross of three varieties with different dormancy behaviour and origin. the fruit harvest time trait was also analyzed in order to gain insight into the effect of dormancy duration on the subsequent fruit phenology.

RESULTS
phenotypic assessment and correlation between traits
traits evaluated in the ‘v6’ x ‘granada’ progeny are listed in table  <dig>  the mean chilling requirement values for dormancy release, measured following the most popular weinberger , utah  and dynamic  models, were essentially equivalent in aa and ej, in spite of the two-weeks delay of chilling accumulation observed in ej location with respect to aa at  <dig> cu and  <dig> ch . this suggests that the three models used for the evaluation of chilling requirements are essentially valid under the climatic conditions of aa and ej sites. in close agreement with the chilling delay of two weeks in ej, the mean endodormancy release date in this location was 15 days later than in aa . however the mean ecodormancy release and blooming delays between ej and aa decreased to  <dig> and 8 days respectively, due to the faster fulfilment of heat requirements in the warmer conditions of ej location. favourable temperatures also accounted for the earlier fruit harvest in ej with respect to aa. on average, the time from dormancy release to flower and fruit development was 23 days shorter in ej than in aa.

abb., variable abbreviation; sd, standard deviation.

variables crw-aa, crw-ej, cru-ej, crd-ej, hrb-aa, ecd-aa, bd-aa, penb-aa and hd-2012-aa departed from normality due to altered standardized skewness or kurtosis of their frequency distribution . crw-aa and crw-ej distributions were particularly skewed to the left, that is enriched in low chilling individuals. ecd and penb distributions showed bimodal or multimodal profiles, with two or more separated peaks in both locations.

the parental cultivars of ‘v6’ selection, ‘maruja’ and ‘red candem’, had the highest and lowest range values of chilling requirement distributions  and date variables  respectively. ‘maruja’ and ‘red candem’ data were not available for variables hd-2011-ej and hd-2012-aa. however traits related to heat/time requirements for ecodormancy release and blooming  showed a more variable location of parental genotypes within the range, and numerous transgressive segregants exceeded the parent values .

the pearson correlation coefficients between variables are shown in table  <dig>  the chilling requirement , end, ecd and bd traits showed strong positive correlations among them , moderate positive correlations with hd , and strong negative correlation with penb. heat requirements traits  were also correlating with their respective time interval counterparts  with r ≥  <dig>  and p <  <dig> . correlations between aa and ej locations were high for most of the traits, with the exception of hrec , hrb  and penec  , which indicates a strong genotype-x-environment interaction in these latter traits.

map construction
genotyping was performed using the international peach snp consortium  peach 9 k infinium® ii array  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  snps from the array were identified as polymorphic  and used for map construction. since the different linkage groups showed several snps co-localizing at the same locus, one snp per locus was selected in order to obtain a condensed map. for the ‘v6’ map, a total of  <dig> snps were retained that covered all the chromosomes but chromosome  <dig>  representing a total distance of 480 cm with an average marker density between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm. for ‘granada’ map,  <dig> snps were retained, covering chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with a total distance of 276 cm and an average marker density of  <dig>  cm. this lack of polymorphic markers in large chromosome regions should be due to homozygosity of those regions. further details on genetic map construction can be found in  <cit> .

qtl analysis of chilling requirement and flowering time
the analysis of co-segregation between snps and phenotypic data led to the identification of qtls for all the investigated traits. for every variable, the lod threshold for p <  <dig>  calculated by the permutation test was between  <dig>  and  <dig> . several major qtls explaining 60-76% of the phenotypic variance of crw, cru, crd, end, ecd and bd overlapped within the genomic region 1b, close to snp_iga_ <dig> marker at the end of lg <dig> in ‘v6’ map . these qtls in 1b were consistently detected in the aa and ej locations.

another cluster of qtls was identified in the lg <dig> of ‘granada’ map. the lod plots showed two close linked peaks, suggesting the possibility that two linked qtls were present in this genomic region . given that the 2-lod confidence intervals of these putative linked qtls were shortly overlapping  we considered that region as a single qtl, although the possibility of two linked qtls could not be discarded. this region in lg <dig> contained qtls for the traits chilling requirement, end and bd, which were consistently detected in the two locations with r <dig> ranging between 14% and 29%. also a qtl for ecd was detected in the aa location explaining 30% of the genetic variance. other qtls with minor effects  clustered in lg <dig> and lg <dig>  although they were detected in only one location .

qtl analysis of heat requirement and ecodormancy release
traits describing processes following endodormancy release were hrec and hrb, which use the anderson model to estimate the heat requirements for ecodormancy release and blooming respectively. two additional traits, penec and penb, estimate the time in days required for the fulfilment of hrec and hrb values respectively, starting from the endodormancy release date. a qtl cluster for hrec and penb traits with consistent major effects in both locations  was detected in lg <dig> of ‘v6’ map, overlapping with qtls for chilling requirement and flowering time described above. additional qtls with minor effects but not consistent across locations were also detected in lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> .

qtl analysis of fruit harvest date
qtls for hd were detected in four genomic regions of lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> of the ‘v6’ map . all of them were consistent across geographical locations and years, except for a minor qtl in lg <dig>  the major qtl was located in region 4b, with lod values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and r <dig> around 50%. a second cluster of qtls was associated to the region 1b, co-localizing with the most significant qtl for chilling requirement , end, ecd, bd, hrec and penb, which highlights the outstanding influence of this locus on the reproductive phenology of these peach cultivars. other minor qtls, explaining 10% or less of the phenotypic variance of hd, were localized in genomic regions 6a and 7a. the most significant qtls in regions 1b and 4b showed negative effects on hd.

search of candidate genes
qtl regions 1b, 3a, 4b, 6a, 6b and 7b, containing multiple qtls and qtls with high significance, relevance and consistent effects among trials were searched for the presence of plausible candidate genes. the qtl regions limited by the genome coordinates shown in additional file  <dig> were examined manually. those genes showing high similarity to genes involved in molecular and physiological processes previously associated to regulation of bud dormancy, flowering and fruit maturation, such as aba regulation, cold acclimation, ethylene signalling, chromatin modification, flowering and vernalization pathways were selected as candidate genes . also the transcriptional regulators ppa008979m, ppa012329m, ppa011123m , ppa010822m  and ppa010714m  were included in table  <dig> given their dormancy-dependent expression in flower buds  <cit> . these last four genes were added to the candidate list due to the outstanding importance of dam genes in dormancy regulation, which were previously postulated as candidate genes in other qtl studies  <cit> , and their extreme localization at the end of lg <dig> after the last snp marker flanking region 1b .

arabidopsis
an alternative approach for the identification of candidate genes has been performed by reciprocal blast analysis of known genes involved in chromatin modification and flowering. reciprocal blast analysis allowed the identification of putative orthologs of these genes in peach located within the genomic regions outlined by qtl analysis. peach putative orthologs of genes coding for subunits of the polycomb repressive complex  <dig> and  <dig> , trithorax group proteins  <cit> , histone demethylases with jumonji  domain, histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases  <cit>  , and flowering factors are listed in table  <dig>  only those putative orthologs located within a qtl region are shown. some candidate genes, such as ppa001213m, ppa000318m, ppa000228m, ppa000162m, ppa005747m and ppa012369m appear in both tables  <dig> and 6; however some putative orthologs that are not located within one of the major qtl regions 1b, 3a, 4b, 6a, 6b and 7b, and candidate genes that have not be considered as putative orthologs by reciprocal blast analysis appear just once.

discussion
in this work we have studied nine traits related to bud dormancy, flowering and fruit harvest in a hybrid population of peach. the high level of correlation between traits and the clustering of qtls in certain map positions argue for a considerable degree of redundancy that recommends the joint analysis of traits in three major groups. chilling requirement , dormancy release , and blooming date  variables constitute a first group with high correlation values and similar qtls. additionally, the fact that a significant qtl for fruit harvest date also co-localizes with the major qtl for chilling requirement in lg <dig> indicates that chilling requirement is a primary determinant of the reproductive phenology in peach. heat requirement hrec and hrb, and penec and penb form a second group of traits with common features. finally, hd trait deserves a separate discussion due to the particular contribution of fruit developmental programs to this trait, in spite of its significant correlation with chilling requirement trait.

candidate genes for chilling requirement, dormancy release and blooming time
qtls for this first group of traits clustered in seven different map zones that corresponded to seven genomic regions defined by snps . some of these regions were identified in previous qtl works in prunus species. preceding attempts to describe loci affecting the blooming date trait in peach found qtls co-localizing with our qtls in regions 1b  <cit>  and 7b  <cit> , whereas more recent studies dissecting the chilling requirement and blooming time traits in apricot, peach and almond identified qtls overlapping with our qtls in regions 1b, 4a, 6b and 7b  <cit> . the qtl in lg <dig> appeared consistently in most of these reports. our analysis pointed to the presence of two adjacent qtl clusters that could contribute to both chilling requirement and dormancy-blooming time traits in this zone . due to their shortly overlapping positions, these two putative clusters were fused and considered as one single qtl in the subsequent analysis . in almond, two qtls were also found in adjacent positions in lg <dig>  <cit> . by assuming a high degree of synteny between almond and peach, the first qtl for flowering time identified in lg <dig> in almond co-localized with our qtl in region 7b, whereas the second qtl identified by these authors associated to chilling and heat requirement traits did not overlap with region 7b.

the availability of the peach genome sequence  <cit>  facilitates the identification of candidate genes by in silico search of genes within qtl intervals. following this approach, genes involved in light signalling, circadian clock, flowering regulation, cell cycle and phytohormone response were previously identified as candidate genes for bud phenology traits in poplar and apple  <cit> .

recent studies in apricot, peach and almond proposed dam genes within the evergrowing  locus as the most promising candidate genes for the major qtl affecting chilling requirement and blooming time in lg <dig>  <cit> , based on the genomic location of evg and the abundant literature conferring dam genes a relevant role in bud dormancy maintenance. dam1- <dig> genes are a set of six tandemly repeated mads-box genes related to short vegetative phase  of arabidopsis thaliana that have been found partially deleted in the evg peach mutant showing non-dormant behaviour  <cit> . dam genes are specifically expressed in buds and are affected differently by photoperiod and chilling signals  <cit> . dam <dig> and dam <dig> expression correlated with the dormancy state of buds, being higher in dormant buds and lower after the fulfilment of chilling requirements prior to dormancy release  <cit> . the expression of dam <dig>  dam <dig> and dam <dig> is also repressed during chilling stratification of the embryo, suggesting their participation in seed dormancy release mechanisms  <cit> . at the functional level, the heterologous expression of dam <dig> gene from leafy spurge  delayed flowering in arabidopsis <cit> , and pmdam <dig> from japanese apricot  led to growth cessation and bud set in poplar under environmental conditions favourable for growth  <cit> .

other candidates to be the major determinant of bud phenology located in genomic region 1b are listed in table  <dig>  among them, we have proposed chromatin remodelling and modification factors such as pickle-like , a putative swi3c-like element of the switch/sucrose nonfermenting  remodelling complex , an hda2-like histone deacetylase , ham2-like histone acetyltransferase , an early flowering in short days -like histone methyltransferase , and embryonic flower <dig> -like component of the polycomb repressive complex <dig>  . the vernalization mechanisms converging on the expression of flowering locus c  in arabidopsis have been proposed to share molecular features with the chilling-dependent release of bud dormancy mediated by dam genes  <cit> . the chromatin modification mechanisms involved in flc regulation include synthesis of non-coding rnas, histone acetylation, trimethylation of h3k <dig>  methylation of h3k <dig> by efs, trimethylation of h3k <dig> by prc <dig> complex, and monoubiquitination of h2a by prc <dig> among others  <cit> . interestingly dam <dig> from leafy spurge and dam <dig> from peach are regulated at the chromatin level by demethylation of h3k <dig> and trimethylation of h3k <dig> following chilling accumulation, in a similar way to flc <cit> . in addition dam <dig> chromatin also showed chilling-dependent differences in h <dig> acetylation  <cit> . altogether, these and other published data in chestnut  <cit>  emphasize a prominent role of chromatin modifying pathways in bud dormancy mechanisms.

other candidate genes in region 1b are putative components of the aba signalling pathway, such as ppa003748m coding for a protein phosphatase 2c  similar to hypersensitive to aba <dig> , and ppa006503m and ppa024363m coding for proteins similar to aba-responsive element binding protein  <dig>  and areb <dig>  <cit> . additional hab1-like and areb3-like genes are also found in regions 3a and 6b. hab <dig> and other related pp2cs perform a central role in the negative regulation of aba signalling in arabidopsis, which is overcome by the aba-dependent interaction of pp2cs with the aba-receptor pyl <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the well-established role of aba in seed dormancy processes, only few molecular data support the function of aba in promoting and maintaining dormancy in buds  <cit> . furthermore, manipulating the expression of the poplar ortholog of abscisic acid insensitive  <dig>  caused alterations in bud formation and misregulation of numerous genes in buds  <cit> .

in region 1b we have also identified putative flowering-related genes, such as ppa013757m similar to flowering promoting factor  <dig>   <cit> , and putative regulatory genes found up-regulated in latent buds such as ppa008979m and ppa012329m  <cit> .

genomic regions 3a, 6b and 7b were also considered important for the chilling requirement trait. among the candidate genes present in these regions, we found other chromatin-related factors, such as ppa001213m, the peach ortholog of curly leaf , a component of the prc <dig> complex involved in the trimethylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  <cit> . as already proposed in previous works, prc <dig> complexes could contribute to bud dormancy release in prunus species  <cit> , and more specifically to h3k <dig> trimethylation observed in dam <dig> concomitantly with gene down-regulation  <cit> . the genes ppa004975m and ppa024294m codify for other putative histone methyltransferases containing the set-domain, with similarity to arabidopsis sdg <dig> and atxr <dig> respectively. in region 7b, ppa001803m codes for a putative swi2/snf <dig> chromatin-remodelling atpase similar to ddm <dig>  which makes the heterochromatin bound to histone h <dig> accessible to dna methyltransferases  <cit> .

further histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases are localized in regions 3a, 6b and 7b. among them, ppa009583m and ppa009356m show similarity to hdt <dig> gene, coding for a histone deacetylase that modulates the aba response  <cit> . other putative elements of aba signalling, aba biosynthesis and stress response pathways in peach are ppa004252m, ppa002515m, ppa022266m, ppa026273m, ppa015643m, ppa002248m and ppa012239m.

candidate genes for heat requirement
in contrast to the well-established genetic component of chilling requirements and the close relationship between flowering time and chilling requirements described so far, the genetic control of heat requirements in prunus species has been a matter of discussion in the bud dormancy field. couvillon & erez  <cit>  considered the variations in heat requirement to be due to excessive chilling and found no genetic differences in heat requirements among cultivars. however, the negative correlation found previously between chilling and heat requirements has been argued to suggest the existence of a potential contribution of genetic factors to the heat requirement trait  <cit> . we have observed a similar negative correlation of penec and penb with chilling requirement variables in this work; however hrec and hrb traits were not related significantly to chilling requirements with the exception of a positive correlation found between hrec and crw/cru/crd in aa location .

we found  <dig> significant qtls for hrec, hrb, penec and penb, located in nine different genomic regions . seven qtls overlapped with chilling requirement qtls in regions 1b, 3a, 6b and 7b. no coincidences with previous reports were observed, with the exception of qtls in the genomic region 1b  <cit> .

in addition to candidate genes proposed for genomic regions containing chilling requirement qtls, commented in the previous section, a reciprocal blast analysis for the search of peach genes orthologous to chromatin and flowering genes from arabidopsis resulted in the candidate gene list presented in table  <dig>  the transcript model ppa001943m, located in region 1a, was a putative ortholog of vernalization insensitive 3-like  <dig> , coding for a component of prc <dig> complexes involved in flowering under non-inductive conditions through the epigenetic regulation of the floral repressor mads affecting flowering  <dig>   <cit> . in region 4c we identified a putative ortholog of arabidopsis ash <dig> relative  gene, a regulator of flowering time required for h3k <dig> trimethylation and the proper expression of flc and flc homologs  <cit> . finally, in region 5b we identified the putative orthologs of the chromatin regulators relative of early flowering  <dig>  and hda <dig> <cit> , and the floral modulator leafy   <cit> .

candidate genes for fruit harvest date
the analysis of the harvest date trait resulted in a major qtl in region 4b showing numerous precedents in related works in peach and apricot  <cit> . the transcript model ppa010982m, similar to ethylene responsive element binding factor  <dig>  from arabidopsis, has been already proposed as a candidate gene for fruit maturation date in different prunus species  <cit> . erf <dig> is a transcriptional repressor modulating ethylene and aba responses in arabidopsis <cit> . in peach different erf genes have been found up-regulated in ripening fruit  <cit> , whereas similar erfs have been postulated to be involved in fruit ripening regulation in apple  <cit> .

on the same region 4b, the gene ppa022739m codes for a putative transcription factor containing the squamosa-promoter binding protein  domain, present in the tomato fruit ripening factor colorless non-ripening   <cit> .

however, recent fine mapping of a locus controlling maturity date in two segregating populations of peach limited the search to a 220 kb stretch within region 4b. the maturity date locus co-segregated with an indel into the gene ppa008301m coding for a nac type transcription factor, which points to this gene as a firm candidate for controlling ripening time in peach  <cit> .

in region 6a we should emphasize the presence of ppa003113m gene, with similarity to ethylene-insensitive3-like  <dig> , involved in regulation of the sulfur-limitation response in arabidopsis <cit>  and similar to elements of the ethylene pathway. other candidate genes in regions 4b and 6a were hypothetically related to auxin synthesis and response , since auxin is known to be involved in fruit set and ripening  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work was aimed at the identification of genetic factors conditioning the phenological behaviour of peach. we have identified qtls for nine traits related to bud dormancy, flowering and fruit harvest in a hybrid population of peach in two different locations. qtls were located in a snp-based genetic linkage map. a search of candidate genes for these qtls rendered different genes related to flowering regulation, chromatin modification and hormone signalling. additional studies including the characterization of proposed candidate genes in germplasm collections and functional approaches are required to identify the genes involved in dormancy, blooming and fruit maturation among these lists of candidate genes. the characterization of natural alleles of these genes might offer molecular tools to predict the potential performance of different prunus species and cultivars under changing climatic conditions.
