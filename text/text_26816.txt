BACKGROUND
common bean , pv, is an important source of proteins, micronutrients and calories for over three hundred million people worldwide, mostly throughout latin america and africa where beans are an important component of traditional diets. the high levels of dietary protein  and micronutrients in beans complement the high carbohydrates found in maize and cassava  <cit> . in addition to their important contribution to human health, legumes are also important contributors to biological nitrogen . n is a primary nutrient limiting plant production  <cit> , with the acquisition and assimilation of n second only to photosynthesis for plant growth and development  <cit> . despite the international importance of pv, both in terms of economics and consumption, it has lagged behind medicago truncatula, lotus japonicus, soybean, and other legumes in terms of genetic resources. cdna libraries have been used to investigate phosphate stress, resistance to bean rust, and leaf development . sequence information for pv was greatly enhanced by using roche  <dig> technology coupled with mrna sequences to assemble  <dig>  unigene sequences,  <cit> , though these data are not yet publicly available. most recently, the genome sequence and predicted gene calls for pv g  <dig> has been made publicly available . this resource provides a platform for pv genomic and comparative genomic analyses  <cit> . sequence conservation and genetic colinearity between pv and soybean   <cit>  which diverged from a common ancestor approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , allows genomic information to be leveraged from one species to the other.

in this study we utilized rna-seq to characterize expression profiles for the transcriptome of common bean . gene expression profiles were analyzed from  <dig> unique samples from seven distinct tissues; roots, nodules, stems, flowers, leaves, pods, and seeds throughout development. our data was used as the foundation for the pv gene expression atlas  database, available at http://plantgrn.noble.org/pvgea/. we utilized the expression profiles of all predicted genes in pv to examine the biological processes related to seed and pod development, nodulation and symbiosis, and changes in gene expression due to nitrogen availability.

RESULTS
phaseolus vulgarisgene expression atlas 
to facilitate additional use of the rna-seq data generated for these analyses, we have developed a web-accessible database, the pv gene expression atlas , available at http://plantgrn.noble.org/pvgea/. this database was built using a similar database structure, web application, architecture and tools as the legumeip platform  <cit>  to retrieve and visualize the gene expression patterns using rna-seq data. to facilitate the mining of the data included in pv gea, we have provided the capability to:  visualize expression profiles of genes of interest,  identify genes exhibiting certain expression patterns in specific tissues,  identify genes and gene expression patterns based on http://www.phytozome.net annotation terms; and  download the entire data set, either raw or normalized, in tabular form to facilitate the analysis of more complicated biological questions. using the predicted gene calls of the g  <dig> pv genome to build the pv gea database means it can be easily expanded to integrate rna-seq data from future experiments. currently, pv gea includes gene expression profiles from  <dig> samples isolated from roots, root nodules, stems, leaves, flowers, pods, and seeds at various developmental stages under ideal growth conditions. included in this dataset are transcripts from eight samples including nodule, root, and leaf tissues for plants having either fix + or fix- root nodules; providing preliminary data on the impact of nodulation and n fixation on gene expression, an important biological process for legumes.

the  <dig>  transcriptionally active genes identified in our data  represent 78% of the  <dig>  predicted genes in pv; confirming that the tissues, time points, and treatments used in this study  affected a majority of the genes in the genome and provide an excellent foundation of gene expression in future experimental comparisons. pair-wise analyses identified differentially expressed genes between both tissues and samples . these comparisons identified  <dig>  genes differentially expressed between tissues. additionally, we identified genes differentially expressed within tissues from samples collected at developmentally important time-points :  <dig> , four pod ds:  <dig> , five leaf ds:  <dig> , six root ds:  <dig> , and three nodule ds:  <dig> ). finally, we identified genes exhibiting either tissue specific expression, , or sample specific expression, .table  <dig>

to ensure our transcriptome analysis was reliable we visualized the expression profile of the purine and ureide biosynthesis pathways  and conducted qpcr on  <dig> additional genes . in warm season legumes, such as soybean and pv, purine biosynthesis is known to be highly up regulated in nodules  <cit> . our data is consistent with this as the genes in this pathway are highly up regulated in nitrogen fixing nodules compared to all other tissues . the enzyme uricase  degrades ureate to allantoin, which is the main supply of n for plant nutrition. in our pv data allantoinase, the enzyme responsible for allantoin degradation, is highly expressed early in seed and pod development, likely providing n to developing seeds . expression of uricase and allantoinase in aerial tissues suggests ureides are degraded after being transported from the nodules. leaves, seeds, and pods can then utilize the released nh <dig> and co <dig> in a variety of cellular processes. these results are consistent with reports of high ureide levels observed in developing pv seeds  <cit>  and high allantoinase enzyme activity throughout pod development and seed filling as measured by thomas et al.  <cit> . additionally, pellissier et al.  <cit>  reported allantoin transporters highly expressed in developing pods and seed coats of pv. the results of these three studies combined with the gene expression patterns observed in our data highlight the importance of ureide metabolism in aerial tissues to provide n for developing tissues.

gene expression analysis
genes exhibiting tissue specific expression  are involved in a variety of gene ontology biological processes. genes uniquely expressed in leaves are involved in amino acid phosphorylation, dna and protein binding. genes uniquely expressed in seed tissues include processes such as carbohydrate metabolism, as exemplified by a starch branching enzyme , which is important in amylopectin synthesis, a carbohydrate precursor  <cit> . in our data, pv sbe expression  is highest in developing seeds . these results are consistent with the high carbohydrate composition of pv seeds reported by broughton et al.  <cit> . nodule specific transcripts annotate as involved in oxidoreductase activity, amino acid phosphorylation and membrane transport/signaling are highly and uniquely expressed; reflecting the importance of nutrient transport to the nodule and the high energy cost of n fixation. in root tissues, genes involved in pectinecterase, carbohydrate metabolism, iron ion binding, oligopeptide membrane transport, and lipid metabolisms are uniquely expressed. expression of these genes illustrates the role of the root in nutrient acquisition and the importance of root growth for plant health.

the  <dig>  known transcription factors  in soybean   <cit>  were compared to pv genes using tblastn . this analysis identified  <dig>  putative tfs in the pv genome, representing  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription factor families in soybean . the  <dig>  tfs identified in pv is almost exactly half the number identified in soybean, as expected since soybean has undergone a whole genome duplication event not experienced by pv
 <cit> . the average expression of tfs in all seed tissues was much lower than that of other tissues, including developing pods. fisher tests confirmed  <dig> tf families exhibited statistically enhanced or repressed expression by tissue type . twenty-one tf families exhibited altered expression patterns in a single tissue. five other tf families  showed expression patterns that were statistically significant in multiple tissues.figure  <dig>

seed development and metabolism
pv seeds are an integral component of diets around the world. unlike soybean seeds, which are valued for high oil and protein content, pv beans provide high levels of protein and carbohydrates making it a highly nutritious food for human consumption. the seed and pod samples represent an extended time-course collection of the same tissue spanning great developmental changes. approximately half  of the  <dig>  predicted genes are expressed in pv seeds with  <dig>  genes expressed in all three stages of seed development examined. in pv pods  <dig>  genes are expressed in at least one of the four developmental stages examined. we identified genes differentially expressed between seeds and pods at the three stages of development , and genes differentially expressed within seeds  and pods  throughout development . additionally, we identified  <dig>  genes with consistently decreasing expression levels as the seed develops, including  <dig>  tfs. by comparison,  <dig> genes were identified with increasing expression levels as the seed develops  including  <dig> tfs from  <dig> families, including hb , myb , and arf  . members of three of these tf families  are seed specific in arabidopsis, m. truncatula, and our pv data  <cit> . additionally, members of these tf families are among the tfs identified by le et al.
 <cit>  as differentially expressed between structures of developing phaseolus coccineus  seeds that are also differentially expressed in pv seeds at different developmental stages. all these results are consistent with a study by hajduch et al.  <cit> , which determined the expression of proteins involved in primary and secondary metabolism, cell growth and division, signal transduction, and protein synthesis all decrease as the seeds develop. conversely, in the pods we identified  <dig> genes with expression levels steadily decreasing and  <dig>  genes with consistently increasing expression patterns .figure  <dig> 
expression trends in seed and pod development. genes with consistent expression patterns as seeds and pods develop, transcription factors denoted in parentheses.



soybean and pv, although closely related species, have distinct seed compositions. while soybean accumulates oil and protein, pv accumulates carbohydrates and protein  <cit> . comparing the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in both pv and soybean seeds  <cit>  allowed us to identify genes important for general seed development . genes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis are highly up regulated in pv seeds while genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis are highly up regulated in developing soybean seeds . the starch synthase  genes, particularly phvul.001g <dig> , are highly expressed in pv seeds  but not in soybean seeds  . sts is required for amylopectin biosynthesis, a component of carbohydrates. similarly, sucrose acts as a key regulator of seed carbon flux; high sucrose synthase  activity in developing seeds may channel available carbon towards carbohydrate biosynthesis and away from fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . in our pv rna-seq data, genes encoding ss are highly expressed in developing seeds . in arabidopsis, ss loss of function mutants favor fatty acid and protein biosynthesis over starch biosynthesis in seed development, resulting in a 55% increase of fatty acids and a near 70% reduction in starch content of mature seeds  <cit> . the role of ss in regulating carbohydrate synthesis is further supported by the low expression in developing soybean seeds  , which are valued for oil and protein. the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids is regulated by fatty acid desaturase  <dig>   <cit> . in soybeans, fad <dig> is highly expressed in developing seeds while in pv fad <dig> is expressed early in seed and pod development, but at a much lower level .figure  <dig>

seed development in multiple species is regulated by four master tfs: leafy cotyledon <dig> , leafy cotyledon <dig> , abscisic acid insensitive <dig> , and wrinkled  <dig> 
 <cit> . using blastp, we queried the arabidopsis protein sequences to identify homologous sequences in the pv predicted genes . the homolog for lec <dig> was only weakly expressed  mid-seed development in pv. seeds of arabidopsis loss of function lec <dig> mutants accumulated 15% less protein and 30% less oil while the seed starch content increased five fold as compared to wild type plants  <cit> . the altered seed composition of lec <dig> mutant plants closely resembles that of pv, suggesting down regulation of lec <dig> may affect seed composition. lec <dig> controls the gene expression of wri <dig>  which also exhibits low expression patterns in pv developing seeds . wri <dig> expression modulates the expression of a set of genes controlling late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. the low expression of both lec <dig> and wri <dig> may relate to the lower oil composition of pv.figure  <dig>

abscisic acid  is a key hormone in seed development, important in developing desiccation tolerance and entrance into dormancy  <cit> . aba accumulation in seeds is both temporally and spatially regulated  <cit> . we found high expression of aba biosynthesis genes  in developing seeds, with expression decreasing as the seeds matured . aba biosynthesis is regulated by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase   <cit> . the expression pattern of nced <dig>  and aba biosynthesis genes  in pv developing seeds is consistent with those from developing seeds in arabidopsis .

trehalose biosynthesis is important in regulating both seed composition and nodule metabolism  <cit> . in seeds, trehalose  <dig> phosphate synthase  <dig> , the enzyme responsible for converting glucose-6-phosphate to trehalose-6-phosphate is thought to regulate sugar utilization  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana tps <dig> null mutants, both sucrose and starch content of seeds dramatically increased  <cit> . in pv, tps <dig> expression drops dramatically as the seed develops , corresponding with increased ss expression. we hypothesize that, as in arabidopsis, the reduced tps <dig> expression promotes increased carbohydrate biosynthesis in pv seeds.

nodule analysis
legumes have established a unique symbiotic relationship with rhizobium, which allows legumes to fix atmospheric n <dig> into biologically useful nh <dig>  for this experiment plants were provided with nutrients containing no3− nitrogen for optimal growth conditions or inoculated with either effective fix + rhizobium tropici ciat <dig> or ineffective fix- rhizobium giardini  <dig> to induce nodulation. plants inoculated with normal  r. tropici appeared green and healthy, though smaller than plants provided with nitrate fertilizer . this phenotype is consistent with previous studies reporting the overall growth of n <dig> fixing pv plants is restricted compared to fertilized plants, likely due to altered carbon partitioning  <cit> . fix + plants inoculated with r. giardini were nitrogen  deficient, exhibiting severe chlorosis and a stunted phenotype . small, pre-fixing white nodules  were isolated from root tissues of plants inoculated with effective fix + r. tropici five days after inoculation . at  <dig> dai nodules were collected from plants inoculated with either fix + r. tropici  or fix- r. giardini  . microscopic imaging of fix-nodules  <dig> dai  revealed early senescing cells with few, if any, infected cells compared to fix + nodules formed  <dig> dai . in situ hybridization analysis was used to visualize the localization pattern of leghemoglobin transcripts in these two nodule types. fix- nodules collected  <dig> dai  exhibited little to no expression of leghemoglobin transcripts while fix + nodules collected  <dig> dai  exhibited high expression levels, likely mirroring the bacteroid colonization patterning  and directly reflecting the gene expression patterns observed in the rna-seq data . nodule acetylene reduction assays failed to detect nitrogenase activity at  <dig> dai in pre-fixing nodules and at  <dig> dai with fix-nodules. fix + nodules  from plants  <dig> dai reduced 320 nm/hr/gfw  of acetylene, indicating high n <dig> fixation activity. leaf tissue was also collected at  <dig> dai for fix + plants and  <dig> dai for both fix + and fix- inoculated plants .figure  <dig>

comparing  <dig> dai pre-fixing nodules  and  <dig> dai fix + nodules  revealed  <dig>  differentially expressed genes . comparing  <dig> dai fix + and fix- nodules  identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes . additionally, we found  <dig> nodule specific genes; genes expressed in any and/or all the nodule tissues sampled, but not expressed in any other tissues . comparing these nodule specific genes to those identified in two soybean gene atlases  <cit>  identified  <dig> nodule specific homologs common to both species  including seven tfs and four transporters. the conserved expression of these genes highlights the importance of regulating gene expression, but also the exchange of nutrients between nodules and the plant roots. five of these sequences have no known annotation, though nodule specific expression in both species suggests these are important candidates for characterization in future nodulation and nitrogen fixation research.

cognate genes involved in nodule development and the establishment of n fixation have been identified and cloned from multiple species  <cit> . using blastn, the homologous sequences in common bean were identified and gene expression patterns were visualized as a heat-map . upon further analysis of these nodule cognate genes, we detected three expression profiles: those highly up regulated early in nodule development , those highly up regulated in 21dai fix + nodules , and those highly up regulated in  <dig> dai fix- nodules .

the autoregulation of nodulation  pathway mediates nodule formation  <cit> . astray and ufd1a proteins, both expressed in leaves, function in the aon pathway  <cit> . astray, encodes a bzip tf that interacts with a nodulation autoregulation receptor kinase   <cit> . ufd1a expression indicates the presence of q, a root derived signal induced upon compatible rhizobial infection  <cit> . in soybean, three candidates for q have been identified, all of which are cle peptides  <cit> . pv encodes a single cle homolog , which is highly up regulated in n <dig> and ne, but noticeably absent in ni . surprisingly, we observed aerial aon genes  expressed higher in leaves of plants inoculated with fix- rhizobia than in leaves of plants inoculated with fix + rhizobia . we hypothesize the fix- inoculated plant may up regulate the aon pathway to minimize resources allocated to nodules as part of a survival strategy.

early in nodule development  nod factor receptors  and nodulation signaling pathway  tfs are highly expressed . the early calcium spiking response induces both a calmodulin dependent protein kinase , which is required and sufficient for nodule organogenesis , and nuclear porin proteins   <cit>  . additionally, genes involved in infection thread formation and elongation including ern <dig>  flot, vpy, pub <dig> and rpg
 are highly up regulated in n <dig> . vpy and pub <dig>  which are up regulated in n <dig> and ne, are involved in rhizobial recognition, attachment, entry, and initiation of the infection thread  <cit> . nodule organogenesis involves the altered differentiation and division of root cortical cells prior to the formation of the nodule primordia. in medicago truncatula, these processes are dependent on enod40
 <cit> , which is highly expressed in n <dig> . hap <dig>  which promotes nodule development and the release of bacteria from the infection thread  <cit>  is expressed highest in n <dig>  but remains elevated in ne .

genes highly expressed in ne are involved in processes such as amino acid biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, and sulfur assimilation . we identified  <dig> genes highly expressed in ne as compared to all other tissues . these genes are likely involved in the establishment of symbiosis and symbiotic nitrogen fixation . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> encoding a transmembrane domain, 49% of which relate to transport including phvul.002g <dig> , which encodes a sweet <dig> homolog. sweet genes mediate sucrose transport to the phloem  <cit> . in arabidopsis, sweet <dig> is up regulated by pathogen infection, likely being co-opted to aid pathogen growth  <cit> . we hypothesize this function is conserved in pv upon fix + rhizobum infection. consistent with these results, the two most statistically significant go categories among the  <dig> genes are go: <dig> , associated with transport activity and go: <dig>  associated with oligopeptide transport . increased expression of transporters in nodule tissues is consistent with previous reports  <cit>  of nodule organogenesis gene expression. also important to nodule function is carbohydrate metabolism, which is statistically over-represented in genes highly expressed in ne   <cit> . among the  <dig> genes up regulated in ne are  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> different families and  <dig> transporters. four of the tfs belong to the nodule inception  family. nin tfs mediate signals of rhizobial infection including: root hair curling, infection thread formation, and the initiation of the nodule primodia . they are also involved in regulating gene expression in response to nitrate. additional highly expressed genes in ne are members of the shi related sequence  tf family, with 32% of the familial expression from nodules . srs tfs mediate protein:protein interactions involved in ubiquitination for targeted proteolysis. expression data from both pv and soybean  <cit>  indicates this family is highly expressed in both roots and nodules of legumes .table  <dig> 
gene ontology  categories statistically over-represented in ne enhanced genes

among the nodule cognate genes, those most highly expressed in ne are: nin transcription factors, cyclops, and cerberus with expression profiles increasing from  <dig> dai to  <dig> dai in fix + nodules . cyclops expression is required for rhizobia infection. nodule organogenesis is dependent on cerberus gene expression .

the primary function of nodules is to fix n <dig> to nh <dig>  nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, requires sulfur and a near anaerobic environment to function. the gene encoding symbiosome sulfate transporter  <dig> , which transports sulfur into bacteroids  <cit> , is expressed  <dig> fold higher in ne than in ni . the genes encoding leghemoglobin, which sequesters oxygen  <cit> , are only expressed in ne . once n <dig> is reduced to usable ammonia it must be assimilated for use and distribution throughout the plant. nadh-dependent glutamate synthase  is a key enzyme in ammonia assimilation  <cit> . two nadh-gogat genes  are expressed  <dig> and 10-fold higher in ne than in ni , reflecting the difference in effectiveness. transcripts encoding glutamine synthase, uricase, and allantoinase , each involved in primary ammonia assimilation, exhibit similar expression patterns. nod <dig> was identified in pv by olivares et al.  <cit>  as important in controlling defense responses during symbiotic interactions and maintaining the integrity of the uninfected root nodule cells. our data is consistent with this hypothesis as nod <dig> is expressed 7-fold higher in  <dig> dai fix + nodules than in  <dig> dai fix- nodules .

genes up regulated in ni include those involved in the go processes of autophagy and early senescence including ubiquitination, proteolysis, peptidyolysis and apoptosis. respiratory burst oxidase homolog  genes, which generate reactive oxygen species   <cit> , are up regulated four-fold in ni. increased ros production is a common defense response to pathogen attack  and in response to abiotic stress, including nitrogen deficiency. additionally, we observed high expression of leucine rich repeat  genes in ni , likely reflecting a defense response as the plant reacts to invading bacteria  <cit> . also highly expressed in ni are genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes, membrane transport, protein binding, and amino acid phosphorylation. among the nodule cognate genes are those encoding a second group of nin and nsp tfs . this result suggests a group of alternative tfs may be induced in ni versus ne.

type a-response regulators  negatively regulate cytokinin signaling  <cit> . in lotus, rrs are rapidly induced following rhizobial inoculation in root hairs and dividing cortical cells  <cit> , repressing the cytokinin signaling pathway  <cit> . inhibition of the cytokinin-signaling pathway may contribute to plant and bacterial cell differentiation. in pv, the gene encoding rr <dig> is more highly expressed in ni than in ne . genes encoding both castor and pollux, both of which are required for the activation of voltage gated calcium  channels  <cit> , are highly expressed in ni . the high expression of castor and pollux genes in ni may suggest that at  <dig> dai the plant is still attempting to establish snf or may reflect the induction of ca2+ channels by ros as described in pisum sativum
 <cit> .

roots and nitrogen
gene expression profiles of pv roots were examined from plants grown under three conditions 1) those from no3− fertilized plants , 2) those from plants with fix + effective nodules , and 3) those derived from plants having fix- ineffective nodules . rf and re roots had adequate n for growth, while ri roots were n deficient. we identified  <dig>  genes differentially expressed between the three  <dig> dai root samples  . the majority of these genes  are differentially expressed between fertilized roots  and nodulated roots .

comparing gene expression patterns between ri  and both rf and re identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between root samples respectively . additionally,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between re and rf. these  <dig> sequences represent genes differentially expressed due to the n source . a similar comparison of leaf tissues collected from each of the plants revealed  <dig> genes differentially expressed between + n leaves due to different n sources . these  <dig> genes indicate that the source of n  has a long-term impact on plant gene expression. among all  <dig>  genes differentially expressed between samples due to the n source are  <dig> tfs, the majority of which are up regulated in –n tissues .figure  <dig>

− up regulate low affinity n transporters  <dig> and  <dig>  while n deficient plants up regulate high affinity transporter nrt <dig>  plants fixing n <dig>  show an increased expression of nrt <dig> 



in the presence of abundant no3−, plants will preferentially take up and utilize no3− rather than develop snf. no3− transporters exhibit either low  or high  no3− affinity . examination of the expression patterns of no3− transporters in our root samples revealed plants provided with no3− as a fertilizer induce nrt <dig> and nrt <dig> gene expression, reflecting the abundance of available no3− . in –n roots, only members of the high affinity nrt <dig> gene family are up regulated . n-deficient plants may up regulate n transporters in an attempt to increase the n content of the plant to mitigate –n stress. members of the low affinity nrt <dig> gene family are also up regulated in the roots of n <dig> fixing plants . the constitutive expression of nrt <dig>  is consistent with the recent evidence suggesting that it serves as both an n sensor and transporter . expression of nrt <dig>  in fix + plants may be involved in n sensing.

once n is within the plant it must be assimilated. glutamine synthetase  functions as a primary enzyme for nh <dig> assimilation produced from n <dig> fixation or no3− nutrition  <cit> ; synthesizing glutamine from nh <dig> and glutamate . in snf plants, the majority of glutamine is committed to the de-novo purine biosynthesis pathway. alternatively, glutamine may be reduced by gogat. consistent with previous studies  <cit> , nadh-gogat expression is highest in roots  and ne while fd-gogat is expressed highest in leaf tissues . plants provided with no3− fertilization utilize glutamine in the synthesis of asparagine via asparagine synthetase   <cit> , which is most highly expressed in fertilized root  tissues .

our data shows increased expression of auxin response factors unique to –n leaves . this gene expression pattern indicates increased auxin levels in –n leaves, supporting auxin as the n signal. the availability of n for proper growth and development is likely monitored throughout the plant. auxin has been proposed as an n status mediator, signaling from root to shoot  <cit> . under low n and other nutrient stress conditions in the shoot, increased auxin is transported to the roots to enhance lateral root development, a hallmark response of –n plants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a resource for global analysis of gene expression patterns in pv of  <dig> samples from seven unique tissues across important developmental time points. the publicly available gene atlas, pv gea, will facilitate the use of this data for researchers querying gene expression patterns within various biological processes, as evidenced by additional file  <dig>  additionally, by comparing gene expression patterns in developing seeds of pv to those in glycine max, we were able to identify differences potentially responsible for altered seed composition between the two closely related species. finally, our analysis of n uptake and utilization revealed the n source is an important component of the n pathway and has a long-term effect on gene expression patterns.
