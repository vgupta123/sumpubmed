BACKGROUND
the innate immune system in vertebrates has pattern recognition receptor  families that trigger inflammatory pathways in response to microbes or danger signals. both the secreted prrs released into the extracellular space as well as the membrane-associated prrs, like toll-like receptors , are responsible for the recognition of extracellular pathogen associated molecular patterns , while the prrs located in the cytosol, like nod-like receptors , recognize pamps intracellularly  <cit> .

in humans, the nlr family contains  <dig> members having in common the presence of a central nacht domain  and a c-terminal leucine-rich repeat  receptor domain with various lengths  <cit>  . classification of nlr protein family members is based on the type of the n-terminal effector domains that defines the subfamilies of the nlr family. for example, the nlrc proteins contain card domain , the nlrp proteins contain pyrin domain, while the naip protein  has bir  domain  <cit> . the nlrc subfamily contains five proteins. nlrc <dig>  and nlrc <dig>  possess one and two card domains, respectively  <cit> . though the card domain of nlrc <dig> , c2ta  and nlrc <dig>  is well conserved in the mammalian orthologs  <cit> , they show low sequence similarity to the „typical” card domains. therefore they are classified into an untypical card domain-containing subfamily of nlrs  <cit> . the untypical card domain of nlrc <dig> is referred in this paper as ucard domain.

based on the alignments of n- and c-terminal domain sequences  <cit>  the nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig> and c2ta proteins of nlr protein family are the most closely related to nlrc <dig>  alignment of the n-terminal effector domains, the nacht and lrr domains of nlrs showed that c2ta protein shows the highest similarity to nlrc <dig> among the nlrc5-related proteins  <cit> .

nlrc <dig> is the largest family member of nlr family, containing  <dig> amino acid residues that results in  <dig> kda predicted molecular weight  <cit> . recent intensive studies of this receptor revealed controversial roles for this protein in both the innate and adaptive immune responses.

in the domain architecture of nlrc <dig> the ucard domain is followed by nacht, winged helix , superhelical  and lrr domains  <cit> . the nacht domain is also known as nucleotide-binding domain  or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain  and has an important role in the oligomerization of nlrs, while the signaling effector ucard domain is predicted to be responsible for the interactions with the adaptor proteins and for the activation of downstream signaling  <cit> . furthermore, it also has a key role in the nuclear import since it contains the nuclear localization signal   <cit> . most nlr protein family members contain highly conserved residues in their wh domain, while the function of sh domain  is currently unknown  <cit> . the c-terminal end of the nlrc <dig> contains lrrs that are typically 20– <dig> residue-long, rich in leucine and contain consensus sequence motifs  <cit> . the hydrophobic residues are located in the inner part of the lrr structural motif, while the hydrophilic residues are exposed to the outer side of the repeats  <cit> . importantly, lrr-containing proteins differ in the number of consecutive lrrs. lrr structures generally adopt a “horseshoe” shape, in which the β-sheets of lrrs are on the concave side and the helical elements are on the convex side of the curved shape  <cit> . lrr domains are thought to be responsible for the interactions with ligands; however, the structural basis of specific molecule recognition is not known  <cit> . the ribonuclease inhibitor  protein of sus scrofa was the first lrr-containing protein of which crystal structure was solved, providing an insight into the structure of lrrs  <cit> . despite the large number of currently available crystal structures of lrr-containing proteins  <cit> , there is no available structural data for full-length nlrs. while nmr or x-ray crystallographic structures of card or pyrin domains of nlrc or nlrp subfamily members are available, only short regions of lrr sections of nlrs have been solved up to now. the lack of structural data of nlrc <dig> initiated both individual  <cit>  and systematic studies  <cit>  to generate homology models. a previous systematic study hadn’t prepared a homology model for nlrc <dig>  noting that its lrr domain appeared to be extremely large compared to other lrr-containing proteins and the potential template structures were found to be too small for homology modeling  <cit> . therefore, the goal of our study presented here was to predict the structure of both the monomeric and the heptameric form of the full-length human nlrc <dig> protein.

methods
databases and sequence alignments
structural data were downloaded from protein data bank  <cit>  while protein sequences and sequence annotation data were derived from uniprot database  <cit> . multiple sequence alignments were performed using clustal w  and clustal x  programs  <cit> . the lrrml conformational lrr database   <cit> , the lrrfinder <dig>  webserver  <cit>  and the lrr conservation mapping program  <cit>  were used for the analyses of lrrs of nlrc <dig> protein.

molecular modeling
secondary structure predictions were performed using the predictprotein server  <cit> . modeller 7v <dig> software was used to prepare the homology models  <cit> . molecular dynamics calculations were performed by sybyl program package  using the following parameters: amber7_ff <dig> force field,  <dig> fs step size,  <dig> Å non-bonded cutoff, dielectric constant was set to  <dig> and only the sh-lrr linker region of human nlrc <dig>  was allowed to move. the molecule was gradually cooled from  <dig> to  <dig> k temperature  and  <dig> fs-long runs were performed on every temperature value. energy minimizations were performed by sybyl without any fixed atoms using the following parameters: amber7_ff <dig> force field, 100– <dig> powell iterations were applied using  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> Å non-bonded cutoff values in the consecutive steps and the dielectric constant was set to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, followed by further  <dig>  iterations using the parameters of the last previous run. calculations and molecular visualizations of the structural models were performed using the sybyl program package run on silicon graphics fuel workstations . polyview-3d  was used to prepare surface representation  <cit> .

RESULTS
sequence alignment of nlrc <dig> and nlrc5-related proteins
previously published phylogenetic analyses were used to identify the most closely related nlr proteins from which the c2ta showed the highest sequence similarity to nlrc <dig>  <cit> . using structural and sequence data available in databases, first we compared the domain organization of the ri, c2ta, nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig> proteins . our result confirmed that nlrc <dig> shows a tripartite domain structure and was predicted to consist of an n-terminal ucard domain followed by the nacht domain, and the c-terminal part of the protein contains lrrs  <cit> . the domain organization of nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig> proteins is very similar, but while nlrc <dig> contains one and nlrc <dig> contains two typical card domains, the nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig> proteins contain an untypical card domain  <cit> .

to find consensus patterns in the sequences of leucine-rich repeats we analyzed the amino acid sequences of ri, c2ta, nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig> proteins. sequence alignment was performed using the sequences of putative lrrs of nlrc <dig> and nlrc5-related proteins of different mammalian origin  .

leucine-rich repeats of lrr-containing proteins belonging to ri-like subfamily are typically 28– <dig> residues long, having α-helical conformation in their convex side and show a high degree of curvature  <cit> . our result from sequence alignment and lrrml conformational lrr xml-database analysis  <cit>  showed that the lrrs of nlrc <dig> and ri, c2ta, nlrc <dig>  nlrc <dig> and nlrc <dig> proteins are predominantly large . furthermore, we found that the consensus sequences of lrrs correspond well to the consensus pattern of ri-like lrr subfamily  classified by kajava and kobe  <cit> . to further identify the lrr motifs, a secondary structure prediction of the full-length human nlrc <dig> protein was also performed using the predictprotein server . based on these results we determined the consensus sequences of lrrs  and  <dig> lrrs of nlrc <dig> were found to fit the consensus pattern and length of ri-like lrr sequences . both the number of lrrs and their boundaries obtained in this way differed from the data available in the databases .

human nlrc <dig> gene contains  <dig> exons from which  <dig> , being part of the transcript of the coding sequence , were analyzed. we observed that exons start at position  <dig> of the previously showed consensus sequence of lrrs. out of the  <dig> exons analyzed, seven  were found to be too short and/or did not fit the consensus pattern. these findings were confirmed by the analysis using the lrr conservation mapping program  <cit> , therefore the exon structure analysis predicted the presence of  <dig> typical lrrs in nlrc <dig> 

in the absence of crystal structures the number and individual length of lrrs in nlrc <dig> can only be predicted with sequence annotation methods that are imprecise  <cit> . therefore, nlrc <dig> was predicted previously to contain  <dig> lrrs  <cit> , more than  <dig> lrrs  <cit> ,  <dig> lrrs ,  <dig> lrrs  <cit>  or  <dig> lrrs  <cit>  in different studies.

to gain more insight to lrrs we have also utilized other bioinformatical tools: the lrrfinder <dig>  webserver for the prediction of leucine-rich repeats  <cit> , the lrrml conformational lrr xml-database  <cit>  and the lrr conservation mapping program  <cit> . lrrfinder <dig>  identified the lowest number of lrrs in nlrc <dig> which showed the typical length of ri-like leucine-rich repeats. on the other hand, the lrrml conformational lrr xml-database was apparently more suitable to identify consensus patterns in the lrrs, and the results we obtained by the recently developed lrr conservation mapping program were in agreement with the results of exon analysis, that we described above.

in spite of the use of multiple approaches in our study, the exact number of lrrs in nlrc <dig> is still uncertain and is likely between  <dig> and  <dig> 

to predict the presence of unstructured regions, the sequence of nlrc <dig>  was analyzed by using the iupred web server  <cit> . we found that ala822-ser <dig> and gly953-ser <dig> regions of the lrr domain could be short disordered regions. interestingly, these regions are encoded by the parts of exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were excluded as lrrs from the sequence alignment due to their short length and lack of consensus pattern. although, alignment by the anchor web server  <cit>  did not predict disordered binding regions for the same regions of the lrr domain, we hypothesize that these short disordered regions could be responsible for the interactions with the ligands of nlrc <dig>  however, experimentally determined structural data are required to verify the proposed disordered nature of these regions, as well as the true number, length and boundaries of lrrs.

with further analysis of the lrr consensus patterns we identified two types of consensus sequences  in nlrc <dig> . it was shown that these consensus sequences alternate in the consecutive lrrs as it was found previously for type a and b consensus sequences of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor protein  <cit>  .

several extracellular lrr proteins were reported to contain n- and c-terminal capping motifs where disulphide-bonds stabilize and protect the structure  <cit> . our sequence alignment resulted in the identification of four cysteine-rich regions within the lrr domain. the cys648-cys <dig> cysteine-rich region showing the cx23cx5cx6cx12c pattern is located at the n-terminal end of the lrr domain and possibly corresponds to an n-terminal capping motif of the lrr domain of nlrc <dig>  the c-terminal lrr repeat of nlrc <dig> was found to be longer than the internal repeats  based on the exon analysis, and similarly to the  <dig> amino acid residue long c-terminal capping motif of ri protein  <cit>  it possibly corresponds to the c-terminal capping repeat in nlrc <dig> 

while the tlr capping motifs are well studied  <cit> , there is no detailed information about the nlr capping motifs due to the restricted number of structural data for nlrs. therefore, the cysteine-rich regions of human nlrc <dig> were not further investigated in this work. deeper structural insight into the lrrs of nlr family members is needed to verify both the structure and the function of these cysteine-rich regions in nlrc <dig> 

modeling of the full-length human nlrc <dig> protein
modeling of the lrr domain of human nlrc <dig> protein
based on the x-ray structure of human ribonuclease inhibitor   <cit>  we have built a model for the lrr domain of human nlrc <dig>  by homology modeling  using modeller 7v <dig> software .

we have chosen to build up  <dig> lrrs, the largest number so far predicted, in correspondence with the study of istomin and coworkers  <cit>  and in agreement with the results of predictprotein analysis . secondary structure prediction assigned α-helices or β-sheets with slightly lower probability for the lrrs encoded by the shorter exons . however, our prediction did not suggest extended unstructured regions within the lrr domain or between the consecutive lrrs. in our model the shorter lrrs were predicted to contain shorter α-helices in their convex side compared to the longer continuous α-helices of other lrrs or were predicted to contain shorter loops. our model suggests that the shorter lrrs do not interrupt the curved shape of the lrr domain of nlrc <dig>  similarly to the model of neerincx and his coworkers  <cit>  where the helical conformation of lrr domain is also continuous.

the lrr domain was suggested to adopt a large helical conformation in which the leucine-rich repeats form two full circles  and does not have the previously proposed planar circular shape with large radius  <cit> . our model suggests that the lrr domain of human nlrc <dig> does not consist of more connected circular parts and adopts a continuous lrr helix shape formed by two full lrr circles  instead of the presence of only one lrr circle  <cit> .

both n- and c-terminal cap regions are well-studied in the case of lrr-containing proteins  <cit>  and in tlrs  <cit> , while there is only limited information about the capping motifs of nlrs due to the lack of crystal structures and extended sequence alignments on capping motifs of nlr family members.

the domain positioning of human nlrc <dig> protein was predicted based on the structure of apaf- <dig> protein  which is distantly related to nod-like receptors  <cit> . apaf- <dig> was found previously to be a useful template to model the structure of nlrc <dig>  <cit> , as it is a homolog of nlrc <dig>  structure of apaf- <dig> have already been solved and was found to share the common domain organization with nlr protein family members  <cit> . both a closed and an opened conformational structure of nlrc <dig> were predicted, therefore, two different template structures were used to predict the structure of the n-terminal domains of nlrc <dig> protein by homology modeling .

modeling of the n-terminal domains of the closed conformational human nlrc <dig> protein
based on the crystal structure of apaf- <dig> protein we have predicted a closed conformation of monomeric human nlrc <dig>   using modeller 7v <dig> software . the completion of the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 7th α-helices of apaf- <dig> protein   <cit>  was needed before homology modeling. biopolymer module of sybyl was used to complete these α-helices of the apaf- <dig> which are part of the ucard domain of human nlrc <dig> 

the small helical domain  of human nlrc <dig>  is located next to the nacht domain and contains the conserved ala404-val405-pro <dig> structural motif. the axp domain of nlrc <dig> corresponds to the small helical domain  of apaf- <dig>  <cit>  and the axp signature corresponds to the conserved gxp structural motif of apaf- <dig>  most members of nlr family contain this structural motif where only the proline residue interacting with bound atp is highly conserved  <cit> . the functionally important regions of apaf- <dig> superimpose well with the same regions in the predicted structure of human nlrc5: walker a motif responsible for nucleotide triphosphate binding  , walker b motif responsible for nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis  , sensor  <dig>  , wh conserved histidine  and wh consensus sequence   based on proell et al.  <cit> .

modeling of the opened conformation of human nlrc <dig> protein
apoptosome is a molecular platform which mediates the proteolytic processing of procaspases during apoptosis. the apoptosome assembly is prompted by the activation of apaf- <dig> protein by its conformational changes and oligomerization  <cit> . as apaf- <dig> heptamerizes in the apoptosome complex, an opened conformation of heptameric human nlrc <dig> was predicted by homology modeling using the structure of the apoptosome-procaspase- <dig> card complex   <cit>  as template .

card domain of apaf- <dig> seemed to be disordered in the crystal structure of apoptosome-procaspase- <dig> card complex  <cit> . therefore, the ucard domain of opened conformational nlrc <dig>  was built up using the predicted structure of ucard domain of closed conformational nlrc <dig> 

the oligomerization is mediated by the nacht domain of nlrc <dig>  as in case of apaf- <dig>  <cit> . following construction of the heptameric nlrc <dig> protein a superimposition was observed between the nacht domains of the monomers and the ucard domains of the neighboring monomers, while overlap of nacht-nacht or ucard-ucard domains of neighboring monomers were not present. therefore, the val <dig> n-gln <dig> c-gln <dig> ca-gln <dig> n torsion angle was set from  <dig> ° to 90° within the ucard-nacht linker region with which an opened conformation of monomeric nlrc <dig> was generated . we predicted that this movement of ucard domain  is needed for the activation and allows the oligomerization of nlrc <dig>  similar rearrangement of card domain was seen in case of apaf- <dig> protein during the activation and formation of the heptamer  <cit> .

structure of the lrr domain of human nlrc <dig> was predicted in this work based on the x-ray structure of human ri protein as described above. this lrr domain  was joined to the opened conformational nlrc <dig>  by a linker region  located between the sh and lrr domains. structure of the sh domain was completed manually by using sybyl with the duplication of a four α-helix containing region  of sh domain. this duplicated part was merged into the structure as the continuation of the α-helices of the sh domain  and also served as a template to predict the structure of the lacking sh-lrr linker region. the predicted structure of this short region has a lower certainty, as it is expected to have very high flexibility to facilitate the rearrangement of the domains during the activation. the c-terminal end of the thr653-gln <dig> region was close to the n-terminal end of the lrr domain  in its predicted spatial position, therefore these terminal amino acids were connected. a possible conformation of the sh-lrr linker region  was optimized by a molecular dynamics procedure. molecular dynamics run on this linker region was followed by short energy minimization of the entire molecule without any fixed atoms to remove the unfavorable interactions. the generated structure of the monomeric full-length human nlrc <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  the structure was refined by a longer energy minimization of the entire molecule and sybyl program was used to identify those atoms that potentially participate in hydrogen bond formation. based on our model the structure of monomeric nlrc <dig> is stabilized by lrr-gxp and lrr-card interdomain interactions. we found that in case of the investigated hydrogen bonds the donor-acceptor distances became close to  <dig>  Å during the minimization like those being between the lrr circles. these interacting residues of lrr domain are located in the loop regions of the lrr motifs and can be found mainly in the concave sides of the curved shape, near to the inner side of the lrr helix. the hydrophobic residues of the lrrs can be found mainly in the core of these structural motifs and the charged residues are mainly exposed to the solvent .

it was described that the amino acid residues  forming the nuclear localization signal  of nlrc <dig> are located in the ucard domain  <cit> . in our model the nls is exposed to the solvent both in the opened and closed conformation, but it is presumably less accessible in the opened conformation due to its proximity to the c-terminal end of the lrr domain. based on the predicted structure, the nls is not buried in the case of the closed conformational state; therefore, the domain rearrangement during the activation does not appear to be necessary for the accessibility of nls.

structure of heptameric full-length human nlrc <dig> protein  was built up from the opened conformational nlrc <dig> monomers using the heptameric apaf- <dig> protein as template structure. domain architecture of nlrc <dig> is similar to apaf- <dig>  which made the apaf- <dig> a useful template for homology modeling. it was described that the oligomerization of these proteins depends on the hydrolysis of a nucleotide triphosphate  which leads to conformational changes, and the subsequent rearrangement of some domains is needed for the formation of the oligomeric platform  <cit> . it was revealed previously that most members of nod-like receptor family share the main structural and oligomerization properties with apaf- <dig>  <cit> , therefore, we propose that activation leads to the formation of a homo-heptamer of nlrc <dig> 

in the model of full-length human nlrc <dig> the axes of the heptameric platform and the lrr helices appear to be parallel and the thickness of heptameric disc and the height of lrr domains is very similar . in the homo-heptameric nlrc <dig> there are large interacting surfaces between the lrr and ucard domains and between the axp and sh domains. the ucard-nacht intramonomeric interactions of the closed conformational monomeric protein can be broken during the activation , which can be compensated by the development of nacht-nacht and ucard-lrr interactions during the assembly of the heptameric platform.

in this work both the closed and opened conformational states of full-length human nlrc <dig> protein were modeled by homology modeling. only short energy minimization was performed on the opened conformational nlrc <dig> protein to study the intradomain interactions within the full circles of lrr domain, and some interdomain interactions within the monomeric nlrc <dig> protein. although, the study of the domain rearrangement of nlrc <dig> during its activation was out of the scope of this study, we plan to perform extended molecular dynamical calculations in the future to study the motions of the nlrc <dig>  those molecular dynamical calculations could help us evaluate the development of the intermonomeric interactions and the oligomer formation.

our model presented here is in good agreement with the previously proposed activation mechanism of nlr proteins  <cit> . the nlrc <dig> undergoes conformational changes during activation and an opened conformational state is established from the closed conformational , allowing the formation of a homo-heptameric structure . during the conformational change the nacht domains which are responsible for the oligomerization become exposed due to the domain rearrangement and the ucard effector domains become accessible for the interacting partner molecules.

CONCLUSIONS
although structures of several lrr-containing proteins have been solved so far  <cit>  the lack of crystal structures of nlrs initiated several individual projects to model one member of the family. there have been some approaches that aimed to generate models for all members of the family  <cit> .

in our study presented here, homology modeling of the full-length protein was completed by the sequence alignment of nlrc <dig> and some nlrc5-related proteins . we analyzed the consensus patterns in the sequences of lrrs and recognized two typical consensus sequences in the lrrs of nlrc <dig>  however, nlrc <dig> has unusual n- and c-terminal domains, therefore, it has not been modeled in previous systematic studies and no homology model was available for full-length human nlrc <dig> until now. in the present study we provide a model for the full-length human nlrc <dig> in its closed conformation, furthermore, using opened conformational monomers, a homo-heptameric model was also built up.

nlrc <dig> is an intensively studied receptor with various functions, including the capability of transcriptional regulation of mhc class i, and its regulatory role in various signal transduction pathways has also been reported. nlrc <dig> has been reported to inhibit nfкb and type i interferon signaling by binding to ikkα/β and retinoic acid-inducible gene i -like receptors, respectively. it has been also shown that the lrr region of nlrc <dig>  is responsible for mediating the interaction  <cit> . by modeling of nlrc <dig> structure, we may contribute to the better understanding of potential interactions of nlrc <dig> with other proteins, furthermore we may provide molecular tools for future drug designs.

our model can aid in better interpretation of nlrc <dig> structure studies in the future, identify structurally or functionally critical residues of the molecule and may assist in design of truncated forms of nlrc <dig> for further understanding its functions.
