BACKGROUND
verotoxin-producing escherichia coli  o157:h <dig> is a zoonotic pathogen spread by ruminants which are asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium. strains capable of causing haemorrhagic colitis in humans are referred to as enterohaemorrhagic e. coli . the main source of human infection is cattle, but sheep are also considered a significant reservoir
 <cit> . a study in the uk found o157:h <dig> contamination to be more common in raw lamb meat products compared to beef
 <cit> . the sheep’s fleece is a potential source of bacterial contamination for the carcass at slaughter, particularly if the wool is long
 <cit> . dairy products such as cheese based on unpasteurized milk and environmental contamination represent other likely routes of transmission from sheep to humans
 <cit> .

unlike in cattle, relatively little is known about the genotypic characteristics of o157:h <dig> found in sheep. recent studies in european countries have found strains with identical virulence gene profiles and phage types in bovine and ovine hosts, but with no shared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  profiles between species
 <cit> . there is strong evidence that certain genetic groups of o157:h <dig> are over-represented in isolates linked to human cases of disease compared to their prevalence in cattle
 <cit> . the presence or absence of such groups in sheep is therefore of importance for risk assessment and epidemiological tracing. in collaboration between the swedish national veterinary institute and the swedish institute for communicable disease control, we have used molecular typing methods to compare isolates from a prevalence study performed on sheep to isolates from human patients and isolates from prevalence studies performed on cattle. we have also analysed the genotypic characteristics of strains of o157:h <dig> isolated from sheep farms linked to cases of human disease. the aim was to characterize vtec o157:h <dig> strains isolated from sheep and to determine if the same genotypes occur in sheep as in cattle and human patients.

RESULTS
verotoxin-producing o157:h <dig> was found in 11/ <dig>  of analyzed samples from sheep in swedish slaughterhouses, 9/ <dig> faecal  and 2/ <dig> ear samples . the bacterium was only found in animals less than six months old and was geographically restricted to southern sweden. while both of these observations are in agreement with data from swedish cattle
 <cit> , the differences were not significant in sheep due to the low number of sampled animals >  <dig> months old and the low number of sampled animals in slaughterhouses in the northern part of the country . compared to what has previously been found in studies on cattle
 <cit> , the prevalence of vtec o157:h <dig> in swedish sheep appears to be low although this comparison is based on only eleven positive sheep samples altogether. while o157:h <dig> tends to be more frequently isolated from ear samples than faecal samples from cattle
 <cit> , no such difference was observed in sheep. previous studies in different european countries have reported prevalence estimates in sheep between  <dig> % and  <dig> %
 <cit> , although comparison is complicated by differences in methodology between studies.

all isolates carried genes encoding intimin  and haemolysin . three isolates carried cytolethal distending toxin , and had multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis  profiles identifying them as closely related to a cdt-positive genetic group previously described as common and geographically widely distributed among swedish cattle
 <cit> . the majority of the isolates had only the verotoxin variant 2c, while a few had combinations . single nucleotide polymorphism  typing revealed a single clade  <dig> isolate, which carried the verotoxin variants  <dig> + 2c. clade  <dig> is a genetic subgroup which has caused several large outbreaks in north america and been shown to cause more severe disease compared to other types of o157:h7
 <cit> . compared to the overall prevalence in cattle this genotype is highly over-represented in swedish cattle farms linked to cases of human o157:h <dig> infection
 <cit> . most sheep isolates either belonged to lineage i/ii 
 <cit> , or differed from this profile only by  <dig> bp in yhcg . detailed results from the molecular subtyping are presented in table

pfge typing found an exact match between a sheep isolate from  <dig>  and an isolate from a human patient in  <dig>  these isolates originated from the same part of the country, approximately  <dig> km apart. they differed at only one of eight vntr loci in the mlva protocol. a sheep isolate  from a slaughterhouse in linköping was an exact pfge match to a human patient isolate from the same town. the isolate also exactly matched three cattle isolates from samples taken in the same slaughterhouse, as well as four cattle isolates from a second slaughterhouse. the three of these seven cattle isolates that were from the slaughterhouse in linköping, the sheep isolate, and the human isolate had moderately similar mlva-profiles. there were four identical loci shared by the sheep and human isolates and four to five identical loci shared by the sheep and cattle isolates. these observations of exact pfge matches corresponding to similar but non-identical mlva profiles supports previous 
CONCLUSIONS
 <cit>  that mlva profiles can be more discriminatory and presumably change more rapidly. full pfge and mlva typing data is presented in additional file
 <dig>  the mlva profile differences, as well as the fact that the isolates were found in the different host species over a period of five years, suggests that the sheep farms in question were not directly involved with the cases of human disease. rather, it seems that clones of o157:h <dig> circulate among both sheep and cattle farms in a region with occasional transmission to humans from either of the reservoirs. both the sheep isolates matched to human isolates belonged to groups that appear to cause human disease more rarely or with less severe symptoms compared to clade  <dig>  one of them has a lspa- <dig> profile suggesting it belongs to lineage ii, which has been reported to occur more frequently in cattle compared to patients
 <cit> . mlva matching produced no exact match between sheep and human isolates. there was a single exact mlva match between sheep  and two cattle isolates from a different part of the country. sheep isolates did not form any distinct clusters, by either typing method, compared to the cattle isolates. in general, the sheep isolates found in this study had characteristics very similar to the cattle isolates available for comparison, and the typing results did not support the existence of any particular subgroup of o157:h <dig> that preferentially colonized sheep. however, due to the low prevalence of o157:h <dig> in this study, these conclusions are based on very few sheep isolates compared to the extensive data available from swedish cattle and patients.
