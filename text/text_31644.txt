BACKGROUND
rice is the staple food crop of more than 50% of the global population, and development of high yielding and high quality rice varieties is essential. rice grain quality is assessed by its appearance and by its milling, cooking, eating, and nutritional quality  <cit> . milling yield  is a very important characteristic that greatly affects profits for rice farmers. milling yield or milling efficiency is determined based on the quality of the paddy rice, the milling equipment used and the skill of the mill operator. milling yield is influenced by grain hardness, chalky area of the grain, grain size and shape, depth of surface ridges, bran thickness, and milling efficiency  <cit> . agronomic and field managements also affect grain breakage during milling  <cit> . rice eating quality is important because it determines the price of rice in the market. eating quality is determined by water, protein, starch, and fat content  <cit> . eating quality is negatively correlated with protein content, stickiness, and hardness of rice  <cit> . the main factors affecting both eating and cooking quality of rice are amylose content, gel consistency and gelatinization temperature  <cit> . cooked rice with high amylose content is flaky, dry, hard and non-sticky while rice with low amylose content is sticky, moist, tender and glossy  <cit> . developing cultivars with high milling yield and eating quality have been the main objectives in rice breeding programs in the last few decades.

milling yield and eating quality are complex traits controlled by quantitative trait loci   <cit> . in the last several years, many qtls for eating quality have been mapped in the rice genome. for example, using chromosome segment substitution lines , wan et al.  <cit>  identified a total of  <dig> qtls for nine eating quality traits. many qtls affecting different quality traits are mapped in the same chromosomal regions. six qtls are non-environment-specific and could be used for marker-assisted selection in rice quality improvement. recently, hao et al.  <cit>  constructed  <dig> cssls for qtl mapping of quality traits. in that study,  <dig> qtls for rice appearance traits and eight qtls concerned with physico-chemical traits were detected. qtls related to glossiness of cooked rice were identified in different genomic regions in ilpumbyeo, a high grain quality rice in korea  <cit> . the amylose content of rice is governed by the waxy  locus and mapped to chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the advances in genetic analysis of eating quality, less progress has been made on the genetic analysis of milling quality because the trait has low heritability and is sensitive to environmental factors  <cit> . another challenge for milling yield analysis is that many mapping populations for milling yield had varied kernel shape among the individual lines and heterogeneity in grain dimensions confounds the assessment of genetic effects  <cit> . recently, a mapping study identified six qtls responsible for head rice  yield using recombinant inbred lines  derived from crosses of common parent cypress  with rt <dig>  and lagrue   <cit> .

the molecular and biochemical basis of grain quality in cereals have been studied in the last decade, and the biochemical processes and many participating genes in the synthesis of starch  <cit> , storage proteins  <cit> , and lysine within the aspartate family amino acid pathway  <cit>  have been characterized in rice and other cereals. however, how the expression of these genes is coordinated and regulated during grain filling is still poorly understood. recently, tian et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that starch synthesis-related genes form a fine network to control eating and cooking qualities by regulating amylose content, gel consistency, and/or gelatinization temperature, and through genetic modification of any of these starch synthesis-related genes, eating and cooking quality can be improved in rice. the expression of  <dig> genes participating in three pathways  during rice grain filling were examined by rt-pcr in the maternal line 93- <dig> and in the super-hybrid rice line liang-you-pei-jiu   <cit> . the analysis revealed diverse yet coordinated expression profiles of genes involved in the three pathways in developing seeds. these unique expression patterns of the quality-related genes may influence the final composition and property of starch, protein, and lysine synthesis in rice seeds.

tools for whole-genome expression analysis like microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression  and massively parallel signature sequencing  have been widely used for transcriptome analysis in plants in last  <dig> years  <cit> . the sequencing-by-synthesis  second-generation sequencing method has been recently used for transcriptome analysis in many organisms because of its low cost and large sequencing output  <cit> . in this study, we used both mpss and sbs to analyze the transcriptome of the developing rice seeds in five cultivars that differed in milling yield and eating quality. many differentially expressed novel transcripts and genes involved in the biosynthesis of starch, aspartate family amino acids, and storage proteins were identified. promoter analysis revealed the presence of hundreds of novel conserved patterns of cis regulatory elements in the up-regulated genes and putative co-expressed genes in the rice cultivars with high milling yield and good eating quality. our comprehensive and deep survey of the developing seed transcriptome in five rice cultivars has provided an excellent starting material for further elucidating the molecular and biochemical basis of milling and eating quality in rice.

RESULTS
characteristics of the mpss and sbs libraries and their matching to the rice genome and to est and full-length cdna databases
both mpss and sbs tags are short cdna tags or digital gene expression tags, which are mainly derived from the 3' regions of a transcript  <cit> . about  <dig>  to  <dig>  million 17-base mpss signatures and about  <dig>  to  <dig>  million 20-base sbs signatures were obtained in the  <dig> libraries . these signatures were clustered and then processed with reliability and significance filters as described by meyers et al.  <cit>  . for comparison of the expression levels across the libraries, the frequency of signatures in the individual libraries was normalized to one million   <cit> . the number of distinct signatures ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the mpss libraries and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the sbs libraries. the sbs libraries contained two to three times more significant signatures  than the mpss libraries. about  <dig> to 85% of the mpss and  <dig> to 95% of the sbs significant signatures matched to the japonica  genomic sequence . the significant mpss and sbs signatures from all five libraries were classified into seven classes based on their location on the annotated genes according to the method previously described by meyers et al.  <cit>  .

correlation of the transcriptomic results generated by the mpss and sbs technologies
from  <dig> to 77% of the significant signatures overlapped between the mpss and sbs libraries . further, we used all the significant signatures in the mpss and sbs libraries of the same cultivar for pearson correlation coefficient analysis. the correlation coefficient was low when unfiltered mpss and sbs data were used . removal of a small fraction of outliers  increased the correlation coefficient significantly in all five libraries . for example, the correlation coefficient between the two yr <dig> libraries was increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  after removal of only four of  <dig>  signatures.

* only genome matched significant signatures were used.

expression patterns of grain quality-related genes in the cultivars with high milling yield and good eating quality
data mining of the tigr rice annotated genes  identified  <dig> grain quality-related genes belonging to starch biosynthesis and degradation, seed storage protein synthesis , seed maturation, seed allergen synthesis, seed development, and biosynthesis and degradation of aspartate family amino acids . we examined the expression level of these genes in developing rice seeds of the five cultivars . in both sbs and mpss libraries, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig> genes  were ≥5-fold up- and down-regulated, respectively, in cypress relative to both lagrue and nipponbare . similarly,  <dig>  and  <dig> genes  were ≥5-fold up- and down-regulated, respectively, in ilpumbyeo relative to both yr <dig> and nipponbare . the number of 5-fold up- and down-regulated antisense genes, genes with antisense transcripts, and genes encoding transcription factors  in cypress  and ilpumbyeo  are also listed in table  <dig> 

*inside parenthesis is the number of grain quality-related genes

genes involved in starch metabolism
many genes involved in starch metabolism showed similar expression patterns in both sbs and mpss libraries . for example, the genes encoding  <dig> -α-glucan branching enzyme , limit dextrinase ,  <dig> -α-glucan branching enzyme , and α-amylase  were 5-fold up-regulated in cypress compared to lagrue and nipponbare in both sbs and mpss libraries .

interestingly, we found that genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of starch underwent alternative splicing . for example, genes involved in the breakdown of long linear glucan leading to β-d-glucose-6-phosphate  underwent alternative splicing in ilpumbyeo and cypress . similarly, the genes encoding the α-amylases  and 1- <dig> α- glucan branching enzyme  involved in the breakdown of short linear glucan leading to β-d-glucose underwent alternative splicing in ilpumbyeo and cypress . some of the 5-fold up-regulated genes identified by either mpss or sbs also had alternative splicing forms, and these included genes encoding glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase large subunit  <dig>   and  <dig> -α-glucan branching enzyme . similarly, some of the 5-fold down-regulated genes identified by either mpss or sbs produced alternative splicing forms, and these included genes encoding  <dig> -α-glucan branching enzyme  and phosphoglucomutase  . these results showed the complexity of the transcription of quality-related genes in developing rice seeds.

for validation of the mpss data, two starch biosynthesis-related genes that showed differential expression in the grain libraries were selected for strand specific rt-pcr. these two genes encode agpase  and gbss i . total rna was isolated from the developing seeds of cypress, lagrue, ilpumbyeo, yr <dig> and nipponbare at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> daf . a time-course study of the agpase and gbss i genes indicated that expression levels were higher in the high milling cypress than in the low milling lagrue in the early stages  of seed development .

genes encoding essential amino acids
the aspartate family pathway consists of five amino acids , and is catalysed primarily by the enzymes aspartate kinase  and dihydrodipicolinate synthase . the regulatory network of the genes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of aspartate family amino acids is plotted in additional file  <dig>  the genes involved in the metabolism of the aspartate family amino acids with 5-fold up- or down-regulation in cypress and ilpumbyeo compared to their controls  are listed in additional file 4a, 4b, 4c, and additional file 5). some of the important genes for amino acid biosynthesis showed similar expression patterns in both mpss and sbs libraries . for example, the genes encoding aspartate transaminase , methionine adenosyltransferase , and acetolactate synthase  were 5-fold up-regulated in ilpumbyeo compared to yr <dig> and nipponbare in both sbs and mpss libraries. in contrast, some of the genes involved in aspartate family amino acid biosynthesis were down-regulated, including those encoding threonine synthase , aspartate kinase , and malate dehydrogenase  . in addition, many of the genes involved in the amino acid biosynthesis also underwent alternative splicing. among them, some showed 5-fold up-regulation in ilpumbyeo in either the mpss or sbs libraries, and these included genes encoding l-3-cyanoalanine synthase , methionine gamma-lyase , and asparaginase , which showed two, two, and three alternative splice forms, respectively .

genes encoding seed-storage proteins
the major classes of storage proteins are glutelins, globulins, and prolamins. some of the genes encoding these classes showed over 5-fold up-regulation in cypress compared to lagrue and nipponbare, and these genes included those encoding glutelin type-b <dig> precursors , globulin- <dig> s allele precursor , prolamin pprol  <dig> precursor , and  <dig> kda prolamin precursor  . among the storage-protein genes with over 5-fold up-regulation in cypress, some produced antisense transcripts like those encoding glutelin type-b <dig> precursor , prolamin pprol  <dig> precursor , and  <dig> kda prolamin precursor  . many genes encoding glutelins and prolamins also underwent alternative splicing or termination in cypress and ilpumbyeo. the gene encoding glutelin type-a  <dig>  produced  <dig> and  <dig> alternative splice forms in mpss and sbs libraries, and most of them were up-regulated in cypress but down-regulated in ilpumbyeo. among the prolamin-related genes, the prolamin precursor protein gene  produced five and six alternative splice forms in mpss and sbs libraries, respectively. the 5-fold induced or suppressed genes encoding globulin, prolamin, and glutelin storage proteins either in cypress or ilpumbyeo or both are listed in additional file 4a and in figure  <dig> 

genes encoding seed maturation and allergenic and seed-specific expression proteins
some of the genes belonging to this group showed similar expression patterns in both mpss and sbs libraries . for example, the genes encoding seed-specific protein bn15d14a  and seed-maturation protein lea <dig>  were > 5-fold up-regulated in cypress compared to lagrue and nipponbare in both mpss and sbs libraries. however, the seed-allergenic protein ra <dig> precursor gene  was up-regulated 15-fold in ilpumbyeo compared to yr <dig> .

expression patterns of tf genes in cultivars with high milling and good eating quality
tfs were identified using homology search in the rice tf database http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v <dig> /. clustering analysis was performed to identify tf genes up- and down-regulated in cypress and ilpumbyeo compared to the controls . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> tf genes showed 5-fold up-regulation in cypress and ilpumbyeo libraries, respectively, in both sbs and mpss libraries . similarly,  <dig> and  <dig> tf genes were down-regulated in cypress and ilpumbyeo, respectively, in both libraries. some tfs were specifically up-regulated in either cypress or ilpumbyeo compared to the controls in both libraries. these tf genes encode phd-finger family protein , zinc finger ccch type domain containing protein zfn-like  <dig> , transfactor , and bzip transcription factor family protein  .

identification of the conserved cis motifs among the up-regulated genes in cultivars with high milling and good eating quality
the promoter sequences  of the highly up-regulated genes  in cypress  and ilpumbyeo  identified in both sbs and mpss libraries were analyzed using the 'place signal scan search' software http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/htdocs/place/. many conserved motifs were present in the up-regulated genes in cypress and ilpumbyeo, and these included caatbox <dig>  wrky71os, gatabox, eboxbnnapa, sef4motifgm7s, cgacgosamy <dig>  wboxhviso <dig>  careosrep <dig>  canbnnapa, amybox <dig>  aacacoreosglub <dig>  boxiipcchs, 2sseedprotbanapa, acgtabox, amybox <dig>  acgtcbox, acgtosglub <dig>  cereglubox2pslega, and gadownat . interestingly, many of the motifs have been reported to play a role in seed development and germination   <cit> .

discussion
rice is a major source of nutrition for most people in the developing world. although tremendous achievements have been made for the improvement of many agronomic traits in rice in the last three decades, much less progress has been obtained for quality traits due to the lack of simple and efficient selection methods in rice breeding. with rapid advancement in crop molecular breeding, marker-aided selection has been successfully applied in many crop plants. similarly, new methods for genetic engineering of better crop plants have been reported in the last decade by overexpressing or gene silencing of candidate genes. although several eating quality qtls have been identified in previous studies  <cit> , it is not clear whether these qtls are useful for marker-aided selection or not because the genomic regions of these qtls have not been further characterized. recently nelson et al.  <cit>  identified six main-effect milling yield qtls in the two ril populations derived from crosses of common parent cypress with rt <dig>  a low-milling yield japonica line and lagrue, a low-milling yield japonica cultivar, respectively. in this study, we used two high throughput sequencing technologies to profile the transcriptome of five cultivars differing in milling yield and eating quality. many genes specifically or commonly expressed in the high milling yield cultivar cypress and the good eating quality cultivar ilpumbyeo were identified from the mpss and sbs libraries. these candidate genes are excellent starting materials for the development of molecular markers linked to milling quality in the us and eating quality in korea for rice breeding. it is also possible that overexpression or silencing of some candidate genes will lead to the generation of transgenic rice plants with superior grain quality.

during the rice seed development, sugars, amino acids, and other important metabolites are transported from source  to sink . once in the seeds, these metabolites are allocated to different biosynthetic pathways  to produce mainly starch and proteins in precise quantities and ratios. achieving such a defined composition of starch and proteins require the regulation and coordination of various pathways so that, at each developmental stage, the participating enzymes are present in appropriate amounts and in the correct cellular compartments  <cit> . agpase and gbss i play important roles during starch biosynthesis in rice  <cit> . the genes encoding for agpase and gbss i enzymes are highly expressed  <dig> to  <dig> days after flowering during grain development, and their expression is highly correlated with the increases in both starch content and grain weight. the agpase gene is also highly expressed in the high-yield cultivars of both glutinous and non-glutinous rice  <cit> . in addition, agpase  undergoes alternative splicing similar to the agpase small subunit gene in barley  <cit> . duan and sun  <cit>  showed that a mutation in the gbss i gene leads to a lower level of functional gbss i mrna and correspondingly to a lower level of gbss i enzyme for amylose synthesis, which causes a reduction in amylose accumulation. during rice seed formation, the genes encoding agpases are active  <dig> days before flowering and maintain an intermediate although declining level of activity during seed maturation  <cit> . genetic variation survey showed that the polymorphism in the rice waxy gene encoding the gbss enzyme explains much of the variation in apparent amylose content across  <dig> important long, medium and short grain us rice cultivars and  <dig> progeny of a cross between low-amylose and intermediate-amylose breeding lines  <cit> . the amylose content and the level of waxy protein in  <dig> rice cultivars from china were correlated with the ability of the cultivar to excise intron i from the leader sequence of the wx transcript  <cit> . in this study, we found that the important starch biosynthesis related genes encoding agpase ,  <dig> -α-glucan branching enzyme , limit dextrinase ,  <dig> -α-glucan branching enzyme , and α-amylase  were up-regulated in cypress compared to lagrue and nipponbare in six-days old developing seeds. our time-course rt-pcr analysis also confirmed that expression of agpase and gbss i genes was higher in the high milling cultivar cypress than in the low milling cultivar lagrue early  in seed development. these results suggest that these two genes related to starch synthesis may greatly affect milling yield. starch biosynthesis is also associated with complex genotypic-environmental interactions in maize endosperm  <cit> . since the plants in this study were grown in the controlled environmental conditions , the effect of environmental factors on the expression of the starch biosynthesis genes should be tested in the field conditions.

cereal proteins are generally deficient in lysine, but lysine content might be increased with increased accumulation of the precursor molecules required for the enzymatic reactions involved in lysine metabolism. the key precursor molecules include lactate, acetyl coa, malate, l-aspartate, l-asparagine, l-aspartate-semialdehyde, homoserine, homocysteine, 2-oxobutanoate, 2-aceto-1-hydroxybutyrate, and α-ketoglutarate, and the enzymes involved in their production are very important . enhancing the production of these precursor molecules will require the identification of the genes encoding these enzymes. in this study, we found that the genes encoding malate dehydrogenase  and aminotransferase  involved in the production of malate and aspartate in cypress and ilpumbyeo, respectively, were up-regulated compared to the controls. genes encoding aspartate transaminase  and enoyl-coa hydratase  enzymes, which are responsible for the production of acetyl coa, were also up-regulated in cypress compared to the controls. similarly, the gene encoding lactoylglutathione lyase , which is responsible for the production of lactate, was up-regulated in cypress compared to the controls. as indicated, genetic manipulation of the expression levels of these precursors/enzymes may lead to an increased accumulation of lysine in the endosperm and thus an increased nutritional value of the rice seeds.

in the last decade, oligoarrays, sage, mpss, and sbs have been widely used for transcriptome profiling. mpss and sbs have been recently used for whole-genome transcription analysis and have generated abundant expression data for many organisms  <cit> . in this study, both mpss and sbs technologies were used to analyze the transcriptomes of the 6-days-old developing seeds in five rice cultivars. the number of redundant and non-redundant signatures generated in this study were similar to those in previous reports in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . although mpss generates large volume of data, its complicated library-construction procedure and high sequencing cost limit its use in individual laboratories. as the cost of the next-generation sequencing methods has significantly decreased in the last few years, sbs sequencing has become a popular method for transcriptome analysis because it costs 90% less than mpss and can generate at least three times more transcripts. furthermore, in the current study, about 30% more transcripts were found in the sbs library than in the mpss library. many of these additional signatures are low-copy transcripts, indicating that sbs is a powerful method for identifying rare transcripts  <cit> . the correlation coefficient is higher between mpss and sbs than between rl-sage and microarray  <cit> , or between rl-sage and mpss or mpss and microarrays as in previous studies  <cit> . therefore, sbs will undoubtedly become the preferred high throughput sequencing method for deep transcriptome analysis in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
breeding for milling yield and eating quality in rice has been a daunting task due to the low genetic inheritability of both traits and the lack of molecular markers linked to the phenotypes. genetic mapping of the two traits is also challenging because the traits are easily affected by environmental factors in the field. using two high throughput sequencing methods, we identified many differentially expressed genes in developing rice seeds that may affect milling yield or eating quality. many of the identified genes are involved in the biosynthesis of starch, aspartate family amino acids, and storage proteins. some of these potential candidate genes could be used for the development of molecular markers for breeding programs or for the engineering of rice cultivars with high milling yield and eating quality. our study provides a valuable genomic resource for both improvement of rice grain quality and for the characterization of grain quality pathways at the molecular and biochemical levels.
