BACKGROUND
the hallmarks of the vertebrate adaptive immune system are antigen specific receptors, the t cell receptors  and immunoglobulins  encoded by genes that undergo somatic dna recombination to generate diverse binding specificities. the tcr are expressed by thymus-derived lymphocytes  that play a major role in regulation and effector functions of immune responses. each t cell expresses a unique tcr that binds a specific antigen resulting in the activation of an immune response  <cit> . tcr are heterodimers comprised of either alpha  and beta  or gamma  and delta  combinations, respectively. these two combinations define the two major lineages of t cells: αβt cells and γδt cells  <cit> . αβt cells typically recognize peptide antigens presented on major histocompatibility complex  encoded molecules. in contrast γδt cells have been shown to be either mhc restricted or in some cases, similar to ig, able to bind free antigen  <cit> . ig are expressed by antibody forming cells , which produce both a membrane bound form of ig that comprises the b cell receptor  and a soluble form that is free antibody. like tcr, ig are made up of two different chain types, a heavy  and light  chain. tcr and ig chains both contain variable domains that bind the antigen and membrane-proximal constant  domains. it is the variable domains that are encoded by gene segments that undergo somatic recombination to generate diversity in binding specificity. the gene segments encoding the variable domains of tra, trg and igl chains are the variable  and joining  gene segments, while the variable domains of trb, trd and igh chains are encoded by exons assembled from v, diversity  and j gene segments  <cit> . recombination of these gene segments takes place in the thymus for developing t cells and adult bone-marrow for developing b cells  <cit> .

of the immunoglobulin superfamily  members, the tcr and ig are each other's nearest relatives, however there are dissimilarities to their genetic structure and evolutionary history  <cit> . for example all jawed-vertebrates appear to contain the same four homologous tcr isotypes: tra, trb, trg, and trd  <cit> . in contrast there is variability in the number and class of ig isotypes in different vertebrate lineages  <cit> . in addition the organization of tcr loci appears to be more conserved than ig. for example, in cartilaginous fish most ig loci are organized as multiple, unlinked clusters of , limiting the combinatorial usage of their gene segments  <cit> . whereas, in bony fish and tetrapods the majority of ig loci are organized in the translocon style of vn-n-jn-cn  <cit> . tcr loci tend to be organized in the translocon style in all lineages. these differences between tcr and ig genes are likely the result of dissimilar selection forces on the two different antigen receptor systems and have made determining the evolutionary relationship of the tcr and ig chains to each other unclear  <cit> .

the relationship between ig and tcr is further muddled by the recent discoveries in marsupials and sharks of tcr loci that appear to be hybrids between ancestral ig and tcr loci  <cit> . in marsupials, a mammalian lineage that diverged from eutherians   <dig> to  <dig> million years ago , a new fifth tcr chain, named tcr mu  has been identified  <cit> . unlike the conventional tcr, trm has a tandem cluster organization and its origins appear to have involved a recombination between and ancestral tcr locus, most likely a trd and igh. trm appears analogous to an unusual shark tcr called nar-tcr, which utilizes the c regions of trd and upstream ig-like v regions  <cit> . both trm and nar-tcr are expressed in an atypical tcr isoform that contains double variable domains. marsupial trm and shark nar-tcr, however, are not orthologous but rather the product of convergent evolution generating common features  <cit> . nonetheless the presence of tcr with these features in both marsupials and cartilaginous fish, make it likely analogous tcr will be found in other vertebrate lineages and illustrate a level of plasticity in tcr evolution heretofore unrealized.

the availability of the first completely sequenced marsupial genome provides the opportunity to investigate the evolutionary origins of trm and its relationship to the conventional tcr in mammals  <cit> . towards this aim we have determined the complete genomic organization, content and evolution of the loci encoding both the conventional tcrs  and the recently discovered trm locus in the opossum monodelphis domestica. in addition, these analyses provide a level of detail for the tcr genes of a marsupial that has only been available for a limited number of eutherians such as human and mouse.

RESULTS
tra/d locus
previous physical mapping of the tcr loci in the opossum revealed that the tra and trd were co-localized on chromosome 1p  <cit> . analysis of the opossum whole genome sequence confirmed that the trd genes are clustered within the tra locus resembling the organization of tra/d observed in eutherians and birds   <cit> . in opossum, the tra/d locus spans approximately  <dig>  mb, making it intermediate in size compared to that of human at  <dig> mb and mouse at  <dig>  mb  <cit> . to investigate the degree of genomic conservation in this region we identified the genes syntenic to opossum tra/d locus and compared these to the available genomic data for mouse, human, cow and chicken using the current ensembl databases for each species  <cit> . at the 5' end of the opossum tra/d locus are the methyl-transferase like  <dig> , zinc finger protein  and several olfactory receptor  loci that have conserved synteny in human, mouse, and cow, but not chicken . however these genes are not immediately flanking the cow tra/d locus. also conserved at the 5' end of the tra/d locus in opossum, human, and mouse are tra v genes  interspersed with the or loci. in opossum and mouse there is only one trav segment interspersed with the or, whereas in human there are two at this location   <cit> . these trav gene segments  appear orthologous in phylogenetic analyses forming their own distinct group  in a tree of trav and trdv sequences . the 3' end of the tra/d locus appears to be the most conserved across species since many of the loci have conserved synteny in both mammals and birds. the opossum has two copies of the defender against cell death gene  <dig>  also found at the 3' end of the human, mouse, cow and chicken tra/d loci. in those eutherian mammals examined the position of the abhydrolase domain-containing protein  <dig> gene  is also conserved . the opossum trdv <dig> gene segment further illustrates the conservation of the tra/d locus across mammals. this gene segment is in an inverted orientation and located downstream of the trd c . a clear ortholog of trdv <dig> is found in both human and mouse with the same location and reading orientation and these gene segments from all three species fall into the same phylogenetic clade . these results all support the overall organization of the mammalian tra/d loci and their flanking genomic regions being highly conserved over a span of at least  <dig> my and as long as  <dig> my in some cases  <cit> .

overall the organization and complexity of gene segments within the opossum tra/d locus is similar to that of human and mouse. there are  <dig> total v segments  in opossum, a number intermediate to that of human and mouse . in human and mouse the v gene segments are either trav or trdv, in other words used in tra or trd chains respectively, or in some cases specific v segments have been found expressed in either tra or trd chains and have been designated tra/dv. the category a particular v segment falls into is historically defined by a number of criteria. one criterion is nucleotide similarity to v segments defined already in other species; by this criterion there are  <dig> opossum trav and six trdv segments when compared with human and mouse. these two groups, with a single exception, are spatially separated in the tra/d locus with the trav segments at the 5' end and the trdv at the 3' end of the locus. the exception is a single trdv segment  interspersed with the trav segments . of the  <dig> trav and  <dig> trdv,  <dig> and  <dig> respectively appear to be pseudogenes due to absence of a complete open reading frame  . this is a ratio of functional to non-functional gene segments comparable to human and mouse .

* include the trav that are tra/d.

†  <cit> 

to determine which of the  <dig> v gene segments are also used as tra/dv we performed rt-pcr on  <dig> day old thymus rna using combinations of primer pairs specific for each of the v segment subgroups  paired with either tra or trd c regions  . this age was chosen as an early age where the thymus is fully mature  <cit> . nineteen of the trav segments and all four of the functional trdv segments were found expressed with both trac and trdc resulting in a total of  <dig> apparent tra/dv segments . the number of opossum tra/dv may be an underestimate since it is possible some trav may be rarely expressed with trdc or may appear at different times during development than was examined. alternatively this number could be an overestimate as well, since it is possible that some combinations are negatively selected in the thymus and not used in the periphery. either way this appears to be a comparatively high number of tra/dv segments in the opossum relative to human and mouse .

v gene segments evolve by gene duplication and deletion resulting in degrees of relatedness amongst segments  <cit> . these are defined as subgroups with the segments belonging to the same subgroup by having 80% or greater nucleotide identity. by this criterion the current  <dig> trav segments can be placed into  <dig> subgroups, where the nucleotide identity between subgroups ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the six trdv gene segments were sufficiently different, with nucleotide identity ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, that each belonged to its own distinct subgroup. phylogenetic analyses using trav and trdv segments were performed to elucidate their evolutionary relatedness. opossum sequences were compared with sequences from human, mouse, rabbit, cow, sheep, and chicken using the same dataset as used by su et al.  <cit>  to define the major phylogenetic groups . eight groups of v gene segments  with bootstrap values greater than 89% emerged from the inclusion of the marsupial sequences . all eight contain opossum sequences . four of these, groups a through d, were defined previously and only included trav or trav/d  <cit> . however, the addition of opossum sequences revealed four new v groups  not previously recognized or requiring reevaluation. group e contains trav, trdv and tra/dv sequences; groups f and g only trdv sequences; and group h trav and tra/dv sequences. the addition of the opossum sequences to this analysis substantiate the statement that all these subgroups were present in the common ancestor of amniotes and that some species have lost segments that belong to different subgroups  <cit> .

these analyses also allow us to evaluate the evolution of mammalian v segments that can be utilized with either tra or trd chains over a larger time-span than has been available previously. tra/dv sequences clearly belong to different groups rather than forming a monophyletic cluster  and, as observed for human and mouse, tra/dv regions are dispersed throughout the opossum tra/d locus, although most are located towards the 3' end of the locus . considering that αβ and γδt cells recognize potentially very different antigens these results continue to support the high level of plasticity in v gene utilization at this locus.

the number and complexity of d and j gene segments in the opossum tra/d locus is also comparable to that of human and mouse . encoding trd chains are at least two d and six j gene segments , all of which are located upstream of a single trdc. there are at least  <dig> traj segments located between the trdc and trac all of which appear to be functional by the criteria defined above for the v gene segments .

the opossum trac and trdc regions are encoded by three exons  that, as reported previously, encode residues conserved in other species  <cit> . for both trac and trdc, exon  <dig> encodes an igsf domain, which contains two cysteine residues that form the intra-chain disulfide bond. exon  <dig> encodes the connecting peptide  containing the cysteine residue involved in the inter-chain disulfide bond. exon  <dig> encodes the transmembrane  and a short cytoplasmic  region . in the tm region of both tra and trd there are two hydrophilic residues  that are conserved in other species and that are important for interaction with other dimers from the tcr complex  <cit> . there are five potential n-glycosylation sites in the opossum trac and two in the trdc  <cit> .

trb locus
trb has been physically mapped to chromosome 8q in the opossum  <cit> . the opossum trb locus spans  <dig> kb making it smaller in size than its human and mouse homologues that are about  <dig> kb each   <cit> . genes syntenic the opossum trb locus are also conserved across human, mouse, cow and chicken. these include the trypsinogen genes  found at the 5' and 3' ends of the trb locus and intermixed between the trbv and trbc gene segments   <cit> . the mono-oxygenase dbh-like  <dig>  is found at the 5' end of the locus in the opossum, similar to human, mouse, and cow, but not in chicken. genes such as kell blood group glycoprotein  and ephrin type-b receptor  <dig> precursor  found at the 3' end of the opossum trb locus have conserved synteny in mammals and chicken . as with tra/d, the trb locus organization is highly conserved between opossum and eutherians. this is further illustrated by a trbv segment  located at the 3' end of the locus that is in the reverse orientation relative to the other gene segments. a clear orthologue of this gene segment is present in human  and mouse  making this an ancient arrangement .

there are  <dig> opossum trbv segments  and these can be grouped in  <dig> subgroups based on nucleotide identity with the value between subgroups ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. compared with other tcr, the trb locus in eutherians appears to contain a higher number of v pseudogenes, where 19% and 34% of trbv are pseudogenes in human and mouse, respectively. this pattern appears to hold for the opossum since nine of the  <dig> trbv segments  appear to be pseudogenes .

phylogenetic analyses of the trbv regions from different mammals and chicken reveal that the opossum trbv regions are very diverse with six groups  identified . human, mouse and opossum trbv sequences are found in all six groups, supporting their presence before the divergence of marsupial and eutherian mammals   <cit> . three sequences chickenb1s <dig>  mouseb <dig> and opossumb <dig> did not cluster with any other sequence, nor with each other, and therefore not included within any of the groups.

as in human and mouse, the opossum trb d, j, and c genes are organized in tandem cassettes. the human and mouse trb locus contains two of such d-j-c cassettes while the opossum has four . in the opossum, each cassette contains a single trbd, four or five trbj, and a single trbc. all four cassettes appear to be functional and trbj gene segments from each have been found in trb transcripts .

the four opossum trbc regions are very similar to each other at the nucleotide level and in intron – exon organization. each trbc region is encoded by four exons . exon  <dig> encodes the immunoglobulin domain which contains two conserved cysteines residues important for the intra chain disulfide bond formation. there are three potential n-glycosylation sites in exon  <dig>  exon  <dig> of trbc <dig>  trbc <dig> and trbc <dig> have 100% nucleotide identity and trbc <dig> differs by only a single non-synonymous nucleotide substitution  that encodes a lysine  instead of the glutamate . exon  <dig> encodes the cp and it contains a conserved cysteine residue used for the inter chain disulfide bond . the cp from the four opossum trb share more than  <dig> % nucleotide identity. exon  <dig> encodes the tm region and contains a lysine residue involved in the interaction with the cd <dig> complex. the tm regions are much conserved among the four opossum trbc, sharing greater than  <dig> % nucleotide identity. exon  <dig> encodes the cytoplasmic region and it also includes 3' untranslated region.

due to the high degree of sequence similarity among the four cassettes described above it is difficult to fully reconstruct the duplication events that led to the current arrangement in the opossum. however, cassettes  <dig> and  <dig> share two characteristics indicating they are derived from a relatively recent tandem duplication. first of all, both cassettes are nearly identical in nucleotide sequence over a  <dig>  kb region that extends from  <dig>  kb upstream of a non-functional copy of cyclin a <dig> including the gene segments trbd, trbj to  <dig> bp downstream of trbc . secondly both cassettes  <dig> and  <dig> have a cyclin a <dig> gene 5' of the d-j-c gene segments, which is not present in the other two cassettes . cyclin a <dig> is also associated with the cow trb locus but is not in human, mouse or chicken. this is consistent with the cyclin a <dig> gene being inserted near the trb d-j-c cassettes prior to the divergence of marsupials and eutherians, with subsequent loss in some eutherian species such as human and mouse.

trg locus
trg has been physically mapped to chromosome 6q in the opossum  <cit> . as in human and mouse the trg locus is the smallest and least complex of the three conventional tcr loci. from the most 5' v to the 3' untranslated region  of the single c region, the opossum trg locus spans only approximately  <dig> kb , smaller than that in human  and mouse   <cit> . the opossum trg locus has a translocon organization, which is different from that present in human and mouse . the human trgv segments are upstream of two trgj-trgc cassettes, while in mouse there are four cassettes that contain trgv, trgj and trgc gene segments  <cit> . even though the organization of v, j and c gene segments appears different between human, mouse and opossum, the genes flanking this locus are conserved among these species . amphiphysin  and the related to steroidogenic acute regulatory protein d3-n-terminal like  are found at the 5' and 3' end of the trg locus respectively  <cit> . both amph and stard3nl are also associated with the trg locus in cow and chicken, although their locations appear changed when searching in their current assembled genomes  <cit> . in cows and sheep there are two trg loci, trg <dig> and trg <dig>  <cit> . to determined if the opossum also has more than one trg locus we examined its genome thoroughly by performing blastn searching of the entire mondom <dig>  assembly using the trg cdna and genomic sequences. only a single trg locus was identified and this corresponds to the locus we mapped previously to chromosome 6q   <cit> .

there are nine trgv gene segments present in the opossum and these are divided into four subgroups based on nucleotide identity . all trgv segments appear to be functional, and have been found expressed in the thymus . the number of trgv segments is similar to that in mouse where there are seven v segments, all of which are functional. in human there are fourteen v segments, but only six are functional .

previously, phylogenetic analyses of the mammalian and avian trgv segments revealed the presence of eight ancient groups  <cit> . addition of the opossum trgv sequences to these analyses revealed two additional groups, group i and j. group i contains human, mouse and opossum trgv <dig>  support for this group is low , however it is likely that these three sequences from opossum, human and mouse are derived from the same ancestral gene since they also have similar rss sequences . the new group j contains only the members of the opossum trgv <dig> subgroup , which is related to the previously defined group f that contains sequences from human, rabbit, sheep and cow  <cit> . this relationship is not well supported however, and two groups may not have arisen from a common ancestral gene segment . opossum trgv <dig> segments group in a previously defined group a. the single member of opossum trgv <dig> subgroup does not clearly cluster with any existing group .

there is only a single opossum trgc region  in contrast to four in mouse  and two in human  . the opossum trgc is encoded by three exons. exon  <dig> encodes the immunoglobulin domain and contains a single n-glycosylation site. an unusual characteristic described previously in marsupials was the absence of the second cysteine residue required for the formation of intrachain disulfide bond in the trgc region  <cit> . exon  <dig> encodes the cp and exon  <dig> encodes the tm, ct and 3'utr regions .

trm locus
the trm locus has been described so far only in marsupials and is located on chromosome 3q in the opossum  <cit> . homologs to trm have yet to be found in any eutherian mammal examined so far . previous analyses of the trm locus were consistent with trm being a hybrid locus generated by recombination between ancestral ig and tcr genes  <cit> . to examine this hypothesis further we analyzed the genes flanking the trm locus to look for any evidence of this recombination. on the immediate centromeric, 5' side of trm are three zinc finger protein genes of the c2h <dig> type  . unfortunately these share similarity to human and mouse znf <dig> genes on several chromosomes making orthology difficult to establish . on the telomeric, 3' side of trm are genes encoding speckle type poz-like protein  and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein . in both cases pcif <dig> and mog have paralogous copies in the opossum genome and the paralogue syntenic to trm is the least similar to the eutherian homologue. none of the genes flanking the opossum trm locus have conserved synteny in human and mouse making it difficult to identify a region of the eutherian genome that is homologous to the region of the opossum genome containing trm. in other words, and in contrast to the conventional tcr, the chromosomal region containing trm is not well conserved in mammals.

previously we reported that the trm v gene segments appeared to be more similar to ig v gene segments than that of tcr  <cit> . this conclusion was drawn from an analysis of a limited number of available marsupial tcr v gene segments at that time. availability of the complete tcr genomic sequences described above allows us to further test this observation. trm is organized in tandem clusters where complete clusters contain two classes of v segments: a single non-rearranged v gene segment  and an unusual v gene segment which is already joined to d and j genes  in the germline dna  <cit> . the opossum has six such complete clusters. the remaining two clusters are partial, lacking the trmv and trmd gene segments   <cit> .

to investigate the evolutionary history of the individual trm clusters we compared the sequence and organization of the six complete clusters  and two partial clusters . these analyses revealed three classes of clusters based on gene content and nucleotide sequence identity. these three classes likely represent the most ancient duplications of trm clusters. the lineages generated by these older duplications are represented by clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. clusters  <dig> and  <dig> have similar gene content  and share greater nucleotide sequence identity to cluster  <dig> and represent more recent whole cluster duplications that would have followed the duplication of an additional d segment in this lineage  <cit> . clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contain two trmd segments and share greatest nucleotide sequence identity to cluster  <dig>  representing another round of more recent duplications. cluster  <dig> is a third class unto itself based on not sharing significant sequence similarity to the others  <cit> . these results are consistent with the current complement of trm clusters in opossum being the result of whole cluster duplications followed by divergence of each cluster. these duplication events have resulted in partial clusters cases and different numbers of clusters in different marsupial species; bandicoots for example appear to have only two trm clusters  <cit> .

opossum trmv and trmvj each form distinct clades in a phylogenetic analysis and share only  <dig> to  <dig> % nucleotide identity to each other and are, therefore, from distinct subgroups   <cit> . now having the complete genomic sequence from the opossum, we wished to compare the trmv genes with v genes from the conventional tcr and ig loci. when trmv and trmvj are compared to all conventional opossum tcr v gene segments the similarity also remains low; nucleotide identity between trm v genes and tra, trb, trg, and trd v genes ranges from  <dig> to 43%. in other words, the tra/d, trb, and trg loci do not contain v segments from which either trmv or trmvj appear to have been derived. the greatest similarity for trm v genes remains with the igh v gene segments  with nucleotide identity ranging from  <dig> to 51%. however, the clades of trmv and trmvj remain outside those containing vh genes from a variety of species . in addition we compared the trm v genes to all the germline vh in opossum and four other marsupial species  and trmv and ighv continued to form distinct clades . these results are consistent with a conclusion that, indeed, trmv are most related to ighv, but not sufficiently similar to extant marsupial ighv to determine from which they might have been derived.

in addition to the six functional trmv gene segments located within the trm locus, there is a single trmv orphon gene  located on opossum chromosome  <dig> in a region containing a number of flanking sequences resembling long interspersed repeat elements . trm is the only of the tcr loci in the opossum for which orphon v gene segments have been found. trmv-or <dig> appears to be non-functional and has no leader peptide, but it does contain a complete v gene segment and the recombination signal sequence . trmv-or <dig> is most similar to trmv <dig> and trmv <dig>  sharing  <dig> and 95% nucleotide identity, respectively. the high degree of identity between these functional gene segments and the orphon is consistent with the latter being the result of a relatively recent duplication event that, based on the flanking line elements may have been due to transposition  <cit> . trmv-or <dig> provides additional evidence for the role of retroelements in both gene translocation in marsupials. a similar translocation was reported previously for opossum mhc class i genes, where two class i loci  had been translocated outside the mhc region. ub and uc are similarly tightly flanked by retroelements  <cit> . furthermore, trmv-or <dig> may also provide an additional connection between retroelements and the evolution of tcr genes themselves in marsupials. trmvj is a variable region gene segment that appears to have been generated by retro-transposition since it is lacking an intron that all v gene segments have and is already joined to the d and j gene segments in the germline  <cit> . although highly speculative, it is possible that translocated orphons such as trmv-or <dig> may have contributed to the activation of local retroelement genes to allow their co-expression when the trm locus is actively transcribed. this would have been a necessary step in the retro-translocation events that generated trmvj.

is trm present in lineages other than marsupials?
the availability of a large number of vertebrate genome sequences, with varying degrees of depth of sequence coverage, provided the opportunity to search for trm or trm-like genes in species other than marsupials. a search of the available genomes using the blast algorithm and opossum trm sequences was unable to identify a homologue in any of the eutherian species available. this search included human, mouse, rabbit, dog, cat, cow, horse, hedgehog, elephant and armadillo. the rabbit, cat, hedgehog, elephant and armadillo are low coverage genome sequences ranging from  <dig> × to 2×. while it is possible that in any given species the trm locus was missed in the sequencing, it is unlikely that such a random gap would have been consistently present in all the eutherian genomes. therefore we conclude that trm is not likely present in any eutherian lineage. we also searched the current chicken and the anole lizard  genomes in a similar manner and were unable to detect clear trm homologues. in the case of chicken and all the eutherian genomes, the trd homologues were identifiable indicating that our search strategies are able to pick up this conventional tcr locus. furthermore, we were able to identify a clear trm homologue in the recently completed platypus genome sequence  available at genbank. further characterization of the platypus trm locus is ongoing and beyond the scope of this paper. nonetheless identification of these genes in a monotreme, which are separated from marsupials and eutherians by  <dig> to  <dig> my  <cit> , further supports that our search strategies should be able to identify trm homologues in other species. these results are also consistent with trm being present early in the evolution of mammals and therefore likely lost in the eutherian lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
first and foremost, we have described in detail the genomic content and complexity of the t cell receptor loci for the opossum monodelphis domestica, the first such analysis available for a marsupial. the opossum is arguably the most extensively studied marsupial species and is used as a model of human disease and development. the opossum, for example, is one of the few mammalian model organisms that develop melanoma following exposure to ultraviolet radiation providing a cancer model  <cit> . additionally, opossums are a natural host and a reservoir of the causative agent of chagas disease, trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> . like all marsupials, opossums give birth to highly altricial young also providing a model for early immune as well as other anatomical system development. further characterization of the immune system in the opossum, and t cell immunobiology in particular, is important for better understanding of these disease and developmental models. complete characterization of the tcr genomics in this species is one step in that direction.

in spite of detailed analyses of the opossum conventional tcr loci, the origins of trm remain enigmatic. the current evidence support the following conclusions and model for the origin of trm: 1) there likely was a recombination or insertion event between an igh and tcr locus ; 2) the tcr locus involved was most likely trd or a trd-like based on sequence similarity  <cit> . unfortunately the highly conserved and stable organization of the tra/d region across birds and mammals does not provide clues as to how trd might have participated in the origins of trm; 3) the igh-tcr hybrid formed likely underwent a whole or partial duplication event giving rise to multiple sets of v, d, and j elements one of which remained unrearranged in the germline, the other becoming germline joined either through direct rag mediated vj recombination in the germline  or through retrotransposition . ongoing analyses of the trm locus in the platypus may yield further insights into these possible scenarios for the origins of this unusual tcr chain.
