BACKGROUND
subtilases are a very diverse family of subtilisin-like serine proteases found in all three domains of life . they are characterized by a catalytic triad of asp, his, and ser residues or a conserved catalytic residue asn in an arrangement shared with subtilisins from bacillus
, all of which are located in the n-terminal domains of the mature enzymes. most subtilases have a multi-domain structure, comprising a signal peptide, a pro-peptide, a protease domain, and frequently one or more additional domains
 <cit> . in prokaryotes, subtilases are generally secreted outside the cell during nutrition and play a role in host invasion. subtilases lacking a signal peptide should remain inside the cell and most likely play a role in intracellular maturation of other proteins and peptides
 <cit> .

the first subtilase identified in eukaryotes was kexin
 <cit> . since then, nine subtilases have been discovered in mammals, among which seven are related to kexin and the remaining two  belong to the proteinase k and pyrolysin subfamilies of subtilases, respectively
 <cit> . they are involved in the maturation of growth factors, neuropeptides, peptide hormones, receptor proteins, enzymes and viral surface glycoproteins in animals
 <cit> . the first subtilase cloned from higher plants was cucumisin, an extracellular protease highly abundant in melon fruit
 <cit> . after that, other subtilase cdnas have been cloned from alnus glutinosa, arabidopsis thaliana and lilium multiflorum
 <cit> . the most striking characteristic of plant subtilases is the presence of long insertions of up to  <dig> amino acids in the central region of the catalytic domain, resulting in a shift of the ser of the catalytic triad towards the c-terminus
 <cit> . moreover, the completion of genome projects for some model species revealed that large subtilase gene families exist throughout the plant kingdom, ranging from  <dig> genes in the moss physcomitrella patens,  <dig> genes in arabidopsis
 <cit> , and  <dig> genes in rice
 <cit>  to  <dig> members in populus trichocarpa
 <cit> . clearly, plants possess many more of these subtilases than animals, suggesting important roles of subtilases in plant biology. plant subtilases share many properties with their bacterial and mamalian homologs, but have some unique biochemical and structural features  that distinguish them from those in other organisms
. expansion of the subtilase family in plants is also accompanied by functional diversification. it seems that most plant subtilases have gained some plant-specific functions during their evolution. for instance plant subtilases are involved in xylem differentiation
 <cit> , fruit ripening
 <cit> , seed development
 <cit> , formation of lateral roots
 <cit>  and pathogen interactions
. in addition, this gene family is also related the processing of peptide growth factors
 <cit>  and programmed cell death in plants
 <cit> .

structural features and expression profiles of some subtilase homologs have been partially described in arabidopsis
 and rice
 <cit> . however, there is much less information about this gene family in vitis vinifera. in the present study, we performed a genome-wide identification of the subtilase gene family in v. vinifera. detailed analyses, including the molecular phylogeny, structural organization, functional divergence, adaptive evolution and expression profiling, were performed. such an in-depth investigation is expected to provide insights into the underlying evolutionary mechanisms of the subtilase gene family in v. vinifera.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of the subtilase gene family in v. vinifera
subtilases possess a conserved protease-associated  subtilisin-like domain . based on this, we used the amino acid sequence of the pa_subtilisin_like domain  as a query to search for homologs encoded by the grape genome. subsequently, all identified candidate subtilase sequences were analyzed to determine whether they contain pa_subtilisin_like domains using the conserved domain database 
 <cit> . as a result, we identified  <dig> subtilase proteins in v. vinifera . this number is higher than those reported in other plant species, such as  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> in rice, and  <dig> in tomato
 <cit> . these data likely suggest significant physiological functions of the subtilase gene family in v. vinifera. the numbers of subtilase genes in all plant species analyzed to date have been higher than in humans, suggesting their potentially more diverse function or different evolutionary mechanisms in plants.

predictions of the subcellular localization of a gene product can provide additional information for its functional involvement. in this study, targetp and predotar  were used for primary structural analyses of grape subtilases
 <cit> . the results indicated that most of the  <dig> grape subtilases possess signal sequences for targeting to the secretory pathway. in mammalian cells, most subtilases, such as proprotein convertases family , act as secretory enzymes and are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum  by virtue of their n-terminal signal peptides
 <cit> . this result indicated a common feature among plant species, such as grape and mammalian cells. however, we found that  <dig> members of the subtilase genes in v. vinifera do not contain any known protein-targeting motif. it is predicted that two members  are targeted to chloroplasts and one  to mitochondria , suggesting potential chloroplast and mitochondrial functions. different subcellular localizations of plant subtilases have been found to correlate with their different physiological functions. for example, the subtilase-like serine protease sdd <dig> in arabidopsis is located at the cell plasma membrane, where it mediates cell-to-cell signaling and controls stomatal distribution and density during leaf development
 <cit> . another subtilisin-like protease, is stimulated in the presence of calcium ion
 <cit> . ale <dig> encodes a subtilisin-like serine protease, which is localized in the endosperm cells surrounding the embryo, and is required for epidermal surface formation in arabidopsis embryos and juvenile plants
 <cit> . in some cases, subtilases that share high sequence identities may have differential functions and are localized in specific tissues during different developmental stages. for example, tomato subtilase-like protease genes p79a, p69b, p79c and p69d share 79-88% identities; however, they exhibit different developmental and tissue-specific expression profiles, suggesting plant subtilases evolved various strategies to control their activities
 <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of grape subtilases
phylogenetic analyses of the  <dig> grape subtilases were performed, based on maximum likelihood and distance methods. the consensus phylogeny obtained from these analyses is shown in figure
 <dig>  based on their phylogenetic relationships, we divided the grape subtilase family into eight groups, designated group  <dig> to group  <dig> . the relationship of loc <dig> with the other subtilase genes, however, could not be confidently determined. therefore, it was not classified into any group in this study. another line of evidence, such as the gene organization as described below, supported the group classification of our analyses. group  <dig>  which contains  <dig> members, constitutes the largest clade in the subtilase phylogeny. evolutionary relationships between the different groups of subtilase proteins could not be inferred. by contrast, the highly conserved amino acid sequence and gene organization suggested strong relationships between subfamily members within each group . our phylogenetic analyses also showed that several pairs of subtilase proteins are putative paralogs . these paralogous subtilase members are closely related and have a very similar structure , indicating that they evolved from relatively recent gene duplications. similar to our analyses, a previous phylogenetic study of  <dig> arabidopsis subtilases identified six distinct subfamilies , with five being similar to the pyrolysins and one more closely related to animal kexins
 <cit> . atsbt <dig> is the smallest of these subfamilies, and its two members appear to be more closely related to mammalian homologs than to other subtilases in arabidopsis
 <cit> . recent findings show that atsbt <dig>  and  <dig>  are in fact orthologs of the two mammalian pyrolysins and are involved in conserved processes across kingdoms
 <cit> . similarly,  <dig> subtilases of five distinct subfamilies were identified in the tomato  genome
 <cit> ; only one gene was found in the lesbt <dig>  lesbt <dig> and tmp subfamilies; however, multiple members were identified in the lesbt3/ <dig> and p <dig> subfamilies. within the lesbt3/ <dig> subfamily, lesbt4a-e seemed to be more closely related to each other, indicating past gene duplication events in their evolution.figure  <dig>

we also estimated the evolutionary dates of the segmental duplication events, using ks as the proxy for time . seven of the  <dig> pairs  in grape have exceptionally consistent ks values , suggesting that the duplication events occurred within the last  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years. interestingly, two of the subtilase gene duplications  were estimated to have occurred more recently . as shown in additional file

conserved and diverged domains, motifs and gene structures
the modular structure of subtilase proteins has been studied thoroughly in arabidopsis
 <cit> . this detailed information allowed us to analyze comparable domains for the  <dig> subtilases identified from the grape genome . we used cdd to identify major domains of subtilases in grape. our results showed that four conserved domains  are present in the majority of grape subtilases . compared with their mammalian homologs, plant subtilases share an insertion of 120– <dig> amino acids, within the catalytic domain . the pa domain was originally identified as a region of homology between human transferrin and plant vacuolar sorting receptors. it is associated with different families of peptidases and has been implicated in protein–protein interactions and substrate recognition
 <cit> . for most plant subtilases, such as tomato slsbt <dig>  their activation is stimulated by pa-domain-mediated homo-dimerization. in our analysis, most grape subtilases contained the pa domain, suggesting the potential function of the pa domain in grape subtilase protein dimerization
 <cit> , and that the ability to form homodimers through the pa domain is likely a common feature of plant subtilases. the pa domain is also important for determining optimum substrate length in soybean
 <cit> , suggesting a possible role of the pa domain in grape subtilases in substrate selection. here, we also identified a novel domain, inhibitor_i <dig>  this domain  is responsible for modulating the folding and activity of the peptidase pro-enzyme. in many cases, it is synthesized as part of a large precursor protein as an n-terminal domain associated with an inactive peptidase. this domain prevents access of the substrate to the active site. once the n-terminal inhibitory domain is removed, either by interaction with a secondary peptidase or by autocatalytic cleavage, the activity of subtilase is stimulated
 <cit> . it seems that autocatalytic cleavage of the inhibitor-i <dig> domain contributes to the precise regulation of grape subtilase enzymes’ activities. a similar regulatory mechanism is reported in other plants. for example, the tomato  sisbt <dig> possesses a potentially auto-inhibitory beta-hairpin domain that may obstruct the active site of the monomeric enzyme. upon homo-dimerization mediated by the pa domain, this hairpin is immobilized by binding to the pa domain and its auto-inhibitory activity is relieved, stimulating the subtilase activity
 <cit> . peptidases_s8_ <dig> and peptidases_s8_s <dig> domains might play a role in digesting the specific substrates for grape subtilases. however, the following exceptions were observed: in addition to the four conserved domains, loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> and loc <dig> also contain other domains. for example, the duf <dig> domain exists in loc <dig> and loc <dig>  this domain functions in sugar hydrolysis in other organisms such as fungi
 <cit> . in addition, the co-occurrence of a proteinase k domain and a p <dig> domain was reported in magnaporthe grisea
 <cit> . we also found that two subtilases  do not contain the inhibitor_i <dig> domain. three copies of the peptidases_s8_s <dig> domains were present in loc <dig> , suggesting possible domain duplication events during this gene’s evolution.

cdd analyses were used to identify structurally conserved domains in subtilases. small motifs and more divergent patterns cannot be recognized through cdd analyses; therefore, we also used meme 
 <cit>  to study the diversification of grape subtilases. as a result,  <dig> distinct motifs were identified  and their details are presented in additional file
3: table s <dig>  as mentioned above, phylogenetic analyses broadly divided grape subtilase genes into eight major groups. noticeably, most of the closely related members in each of these groups have common motif compositions, suggesting functional similarities between the subtilase proteins within the same group. we also found that some motifs  are absent from members of group  <dig>  possibly leading to some functional differentiation. generally, conserved motifs in subtilase proteins from the same group are consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analyses.figure  <dig> 
distribution of conserved motifs in the subtilase family members. all motifs were identified by meme using the complete amino acid sequence of the  <dig> grape subtilases documented in figure 
 <dig>  the names of all members among the defined gene clusters and combined p-values are shown on the left side of the figure; motif sizes are indicated at the bottom of the figure. different motifs are indicated by different colors and are numbered 1– <dig>  the same number in different proteins refers to the same motif. for details of the motifs refer to table s <dig> .



gene structural diversification may play an important role in the evolution of multigene families
 <cit> . to gain further insights into the structural diversity of subtilases, we compared the exon-intron organization of the coding sequences of individual subtilase genes in grape. detailed illustrations of the exon-intron structures are shown in figure
 <dig>  in general, most closely related members in the same group shared a similar exon-intron structure. interestingly, we also found that the number of introns varies considerably between different groups of grape subtilases, and most members of groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> do not contain introns. this can be explained by differences in the rates of intron gain and loss
 <cit> . similar to grape subtilases, papaya subtilases also contain introns
 <cit> ; however, intronless subtilase genes have been reported in arabidopsis and tomato
 <cit> . it has been suggested that introns not only increase the fitness of an organism by increasing intragenic recombination
 <cit> , but also are related to the evolutional rate of genes. for instance, some genes that rarely contain introns  often experienced positive selection in their evolution
. introns are unequally distributed in some gene families
 <cit>  because of the ongoing intron gain and loss. whether the large number of intron losses in groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of grape subtilases have similar effects to those described above remains to be further experimentally examined.

chromosomal distribution and gene duplications of the grape subtilase genes
we further analyzed gene duplication events to understand the potential genetic mechanisms in the evolution of the grape subtilase gene family. first, we compared the locations of subtilase genes in duplicated chromosomal blocks that were previously identified in grape
 <cit> . the distributions of subtilase genes relative to the corresponding duplicate genomic blocks are shown in figure
 <dig>  nine grape subtilase genes are located on unassembled genomic sequence scaffolds and thus could not be mapped to any particular chromosome. the other subtilase genes are distributed unevenly among  <dig> of the  <dig> grape chromosomes. among the identified duplication events, only two subtilase genes  are retained duplicates that are located in both duplicated chromosomal regions, whereas all others lack corresponding duplicates. from figure
 <dig>  we also found that eight subtilase genes  are located outside of any duplicated blocks. this result suggests that segmental duplication is not the major factor that led to the expansion of the subtilase gene family in grape. it may be that dynamic changes occurred following segmental duplication, leading to the loss of many of the genes. interestingly, we found that most subtilase genes are located in tandem clusters on the chromosomes. the largest subtilase gene cluster is located on chromosome  <dig> and contains  <dig> tandemly arrayed members, i.e. loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> and loc <dig> . phylogenetically, these  <dig> genes form a single clade, suggesting that they may result from recent tandem duplications. however, we also found that five members  on chromosome  <dig> and one member  on chromosome  <dig> may also be derived from another duplication event of the 13-clustered members on chromosome  <dig>  further analyses indicate that most of these subtilases share relatively high similarities. we hypothesized that they might have resulted from more ancient tandem duplication or retroposition events . however, simultaneous expansions in the s <dig> and s <dig> families of subtilases in a single fungal species are rare
 <cit> . in the arabidopsis genome, 54 % of atsbt genes also show tandem duplications of 2– <dig> genes. these arrangements suggest that local duplication events have also played an important role in the atsbt family expansion. furthermore, several highly similar sequences are found on different chromosomes. similar situations indicative of a complex evolutionary history have been observed in other arabidopsis gene families
 <cit> . the mtsbt <dig>  of medicago truncatula show 90 % similarity to mtsb <dig>  at the protein level, suggesting an ancestral duplication event
 <cit> . extracellular proteolytic activities of subtilase proteins are associated with virulence in pathogenic rhizopus oryzae, and the whole genome duplication of subtilases in r. oryzae might have contributed to its virulence

analysis of functional divergence
could amino acid substitutions in subtilases have caused adaptive functional diversification? to answer this question, we estimated type-i functional divergence between gene clusters of the grape subtilase family by posterior analysis using the program diverge
 <cit> . we compared  <dig> pairs of paralogous genes and estimated the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence position. the results indicated that the coefficients of all functional divergence  values between these groups were less than  <dig> , suggesting site-specific selective constraints on most members of the grape subtilase family. moreover, we also predicted some critical amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence based on site-specific profiles, in combination with suitable cut-off values derived from the posterior probability of each comparison. these critical amino acid residues might have contributed to the functional divergence of grape subtilases. similar to our analyses, siezen et al. also found several essential and conserved amino acid residues, such as d <dig>  h <dig> and g <dig>  by comparing the pa domain in over  <dig> subtilases
 <cit> . our results also showed distinct differences in the number and distribution of predicted sites for functional divergence within each pair. for example, using a cut-off value of  <dig> , only one critical amino acid site was predicted for the sequences in the group 3/ <dig> pairs, while approximately  <dig> and  <dig> were predicted for group 3/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> pairs, respectively. as shown in table
 <dig>  group 3/ <dig> had the minimal theta value  , indicating the lowest evolutionary rate or site-specific selective relaxation between them. by contrast, the theta value in group 1/ <dig> was the highest , suggesting the largest divergence between them. clearly, different evolutionary rates at specific sites within each pair could promote functional divergence among different groups during the long period of evolution. our results showed that the different evolutionary rates at some important amino acid residues contributed to the evolution of grape subtilases, which might have acquired some group-specific functions.table  <dig>

site-specific selective pressure analysis
to analyze positive or negative selection of specific amino acid sites within the full-length sequences of the subtilase proteins in the different groups, substitution rate ratios of nonsynonymous  versus synonymous  mutations  were calculated using datamonkey
 <cit> . our results showed that the ka/ks ratios of the sequences between subtilase groups were significantly different . in addition, all the estimated ka/ks values were substantially less than  <dig>  suggesting that the subtilase sequences within each group are under strong purifying selection pressure. we performed the tests using three methods 
 <cit> . the slac software detected no positively selected codon sites within groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but found three and one positively selected sites within groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. fel and rel analyses identified more sites . the parris test
 <cit>  did not reveal strong evidence  of positive selection in subtilase coding sequences . clearly, although most of the protein residues are subjected to constant purifying selection, some sites have also been influenced by positive selection. positive selection is an important adaptive mechanism; therefore, the sites under positive selection pressure might have accelerated functional divergence of grape subtilases, thus allowing the grape to adapt to its environment. our results are in agreement with the study by subbian et al. on the selective effect of subtilisin e and its homologous isp proteins. although subtilisin e and isp are highly conserved in sequence and structure, they can fold through significantly different pathways and kinetics, and the positive selective effect on their surface residues could affect their thermodynamic stability and choice of folding pathways

differential expression profiles of grape subtilase genes
subtilases degrade substrates ranging from non-selective proteins to highly specific maturation of peptide hormones or protein precursors. compared with animals, the subtilase family in plants has significantly expanded and has acquired some plant-specific functions. plant subtilases are involved in stomata and seeds development, maintenance of shoot apical meristem and cell wall, processing of peptide growth factors, and response to abiotic environment
 <cit> . developmental or tissue-specific expressions of subtilases might represent various physiological functions
 <cit> . here, we first performed a comprehensive quantitative real-time-pcr  analysis of subtilases to investigate their expression patterns in different tissues. as shown in figure
 <dig>  most subtilase genes show a constitutive distribution and slightly higher level of accumulation in grape leaves, root and shoot apices. some subtilase genes, such as loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> and loc <dig>  are present at a ubiquitously high level in roots, leaves, stems, floral buds and internodes, indicating the role of subtilases in general tissue growth and development. in particular, we found that loc <dig> is highly similar to arabidopsis subtilase sdd <dig> and a high transcript level in grape leaves, suggesting a similar function in leaf cell stomatal development as arabidopsis sdd1
 <cit> . the arabidopsis subtilase air <dig> is also highly expressed in lateral roots
 <cit> . similarly, loc <dig>  which is homologous to air <dig>  also showed a high transcript level in grape roots. these gene transcription profiles suggested that some grape subtilases have similar expression patterns to their homologs in other plant species. loc <dig> showed the highest transcript level during all four phases of growth, despite its very low transcript level in floral buds and internode tissues.figure  <dig> 
expression profiles of the grape subtilase gene family. for saline stress treatments, 3-week grape seedlings were treated with 100 mm nacl for 6 h or 12 h; for cold and heat stress treatments, the 3-week seedlings were treated with 4°c or 42°c for 6 h and 12 h; for drought treatments, the 3-week seedlings were dried for 7 days or 12 days. expression profiles of subtilase genes family in different tissues  and in 2-month-old grapes were used. ghb, green hard berry; gsb, green soft berry; psb, pink soft berry; rsb, red soft berry.



we further selected four fruit growth phases to investigate these genes’ expressions during the fruit maturing process; these four phases were green hard berry, green soft berry, pink soft berry and red soft berry. as shown in figure
 <dig>  different expression levels of subtilase genes were found in these four growth phases. some genes, such as loc <dig> and loc <dig>  showed a higher transcript level in fruit, but lower in other tissues. furthermore, loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> and loc <dig> showed lower transcript levels in fruit, but higher levels in leaves, roots and floral buds. the subtilase gene sbt <dig>  is specifically expressed in the endosperm of medicago truncatula and pisum sativum seeds to control seed size
 <cit> . in this study, we found that loc  <dig>  an ortholog of sbt <dig> , was also transcribed at a high level during grape fruit development.

environmental stress might regulate subtilase gene expression differentially
 <cit> . therefore, we tested the differences in expressions of grape subtilase mrnas under various environmental stresses, including salt, cold, heat and drought. these environmental stresses are frequently confronted during grape growth. several genes, such as loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  and loc <dig>  were obviously induced after different stress treatments. other genes, including loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  and loc <dig>  were obviously suppressed by these environmental stresses. meanwhile, most of these genes demonstrated a comparable expression profile when subjected to the various environmental stresses, except loc <dig> and loc <dig>  which were expressed at a higher level after salt treatment, but a lower level after heat and drought stresses. previous studies reported that pvslp <dig> transcription was not induced by drought stress; however, pvslp <dig> activity can be stimulated by drought stress, suggesting that plant subtilase activities may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level
 <cit> . thus, we could not exclude the possibility that some grape subtilases are involved in environmental stress responses at the post-transcriptional level, even though we did not detect their transcriptional differences.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified and annotated  <dig> subtilases comprising eight subgroups in the v. vinifera genome. the analyses of gene structures, duplications, and selection provided valuable information on the evolution of grape subtilases. in particular, we found that tandem duplications have played an important role in the expansion of the subtilase gene family. selection analysis revealed that purifying selection has been the main force during the evolution of the subtilase, while some of the critical sites have been subjected to positive selection. moreover, analyses of their expression profiles provided functional information for members of the subtilase gene family in grape at different development stages. further, investigations on the response patterns of the subtilase genes to salinity, cold, heat and drought conditions identified candidate stress-responsive genes in grape. our results contribute valuable information for future functional investigations of this gene family.
