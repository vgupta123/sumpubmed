BACKGROUND
canine aa instability  has been treated via surgical stabilization for almost 50 years  <cit> . methods of stabilization have evolved from simple dorsal aa sutures to ventral transarticular screw fixation  and more complex constructs composed of multiple ventral implants embedded in polymethylmethacrylate cement . despite overall satisfactory outcomes obtained with modern procedures , ventral aa stabilization remains technically challenging and is associated with relatively high mortality rates   <cit> .

the small size of affected dogs and extremely narrow bone corridors used to position stabilizing implants are often considered major technical limitations of these procedures  <cit> . these technical difficulties have led neurosurgeons to develop novel techniques to either improve accuracy of implant placement or to multiply the number of implants to better distribute the load applied on the stabilizing construct . complications directly resulting from such narrow bone corridors include iatrogenic bone fracture and violation of the vertebral canal by the stabilizing implants. both of these complications can have disastrous consequences for the patient either by compromising the stability of the construct or by causing iatrogenic spinal cord injury. although the incidence of either complication in canine aa stabilization is unknown, experimental studies on ventral placement of pedicular and monocortical implants in other cervical vertebrae have demonstrated that vertebral canal violation is common  <cit> . it can be hypothesized that vertebral canal violation in aa stabilization is likely as common and underestimated by clinicians given that radiographs have a low sensitivity to detect vertebral canal violation and that postoperative ct is not commonly performed in veterinary medicine  <cit> .

in human medicine, extensive precautions are taken to avoid both vertebral canal violation and vertebral artery injury when performing cervical and aa stabilization. routine stabilization procedures rely on readily available anatomical data defining osics, preoperative planning using advanced imaging and various imaging-based intraoperative guidance techniques . in veterinary spinal surgery, preoperative planning is often limited and intraoperative neuronavigation is not routinely available, leaving neurosurgeons with the descriptive data provided by the literature to guide implant placement.

traditionally, vertebral osics have been characterized using radiographic and ct images. this has been achieved by identifying a theoretical plane within which the optimal implant is to be positioned. using such a predefined plane allows simplification of a complex 3d problem into a bidimensional description. this method has been applied successfully along most of the vertebral column because stabilizing implants are typically positioned within the transverse plane of each vertebra . however, most of the reported atlas  and axis  implantation sites have an oblique direction precluding the use of these traditional methods. as a result, aa implant sites have been subjectively defined without detailed anatomical description. the only osic that has been more precisely studied in dogs is the corridor used for tsf fixation  <cit> . however, available studies have used different subjective definitions of the optimal implant position and therefore obtained slightly different results. overall, precise objective surgical guidelines are currently lacking for aa ventral stabilization.

our initial objective was to provide data to the veterinary community describing as precisely as possible optimized methods of aa stabilization. as we began to work on the description of optimal implant positioning, we realized that a new method of analysis of bone corridors would be necessary to precisely depict the complex 3d interrelationships between anatomical structures and implants. therefore, we planned to develop a novel approach for the analysis of ct 3d data, using the digital imaging and communication in medicine  software osirix™. in order to apply this method in a time-efficient manner, a mathematical model was also developed to semi-automatize the process.

in the present study, our objective was to describe and validate this new method of bone corridor analysis. we hypothesized 1- that mathematical calculations would have high concordance when compared to manual measures, and 2- that predefined anatomical landmarks could be used reliably to calculate 3d implant coordinates.

methods
preliminary review of the literature
an extensive online literature search was conducted prior to the study in order to identify available descriptions of canine aa anatomy as well as bone corridors previously used for ventral aa stabilization. both pubmed and google scholar search engines were used to identify pertinent publications with the search terms “ventral atlantoaxial dog”, “atlantoaxial instability dog” or “atlantoaxial subluxation dog”. when using google scholar, only the first  <dig> references were assessed for relevance. articles written in a language other than english were excluded. all identified journal articles and textbook chapters describing aa anatomy or ventral aa stabilization techniques were reviewed in detail, including identification of pertinent cited references which were also reviewed.

study population and ct image acquisition
between october  <dig> and december  <dig>  dogs were prospectively recruited in order to obtain a ct scan of their craniocervical region. the objective was to recruit approximately  <dig> dogs affected with aai and  <dig> dogs with a normal aa joint . toy breed dogs were defined as dogs with a body weight less than 5 kg. a minimal age of 6 months was subjectively selected to avoid excessive anatomical variations due to growth stage. the ct scans obtained from dogs with a normal aa joint were either obtained from cadavers or client owned animals anesthetized at the ontario veterinary college health sciences centre for clinical reasons unrelated to this study after owner consent was obtained. for aai dogs, obtaining a ct scan of the aa region is standard-of-care practice for diagnostic workup and/or pre-surgical planning in our institution. a diagnosis of aai was reached if dens separation, agenesis, or hypoplasia was identified in conjunction with clinical signs consistent with a cranial cervical myelopathy or if unequivocal aa subluxation was visible in the ct study.

ct images of the craniocervical junction were obtained using a  <dig> slice detector ge brightspeed ct scanner. <dig> the raw data was acquired with a standardized protocol in helical mode,  <dig>  s rotation time,  <dig> : <dig> pitch, 120 kv and 250mas, 25 cm collimation, 512x <dig> matrix size,  <dig>  mm in plane resolution,  <dig>  mm through plane resolution using both standard and bone algorithms. both algorithms were reviewed but only the images captured in a bone algorithm were used for osic analysis. the images were subsequently imported into the free version of osirix™ dicom viewer <dig> using an apple® computer. <dig> the images were reviewed using the window width and level preset in osirix™ for bone ct images in the 2d viewer, 3d multi-planar reconstruction  and 3d volume rendering  modes.

3d optimal implant simulation using osirix™
in order to define objective optimal implant placements for each available bone corridor, we developed a method based on geometrical simplification of the bone corridors. the purpose of this simplification was to obtain 3d geometrical shapes with well-defined centered axes, that could then be used to define optimal implant placements. to be surgically applicable, the insertion point for each implant had to be located on the ventral surface of c <dig> or c <dig>  the geometrical shapes simulating the bone corridors were delineated in osirix™ by placing region of interest  points either in 3d-mpr mode or 3d-vr mode. these roi points were subsequently used as landmarks in 3d-mpr mode to determine centered axes of the bone corridors using various geometrical methods . each optimal implant placement could then be simulated by placing  <dig> roi points along the centered axis representing the insertion and exit points of the implant. further details on how each specific bone corridor was geometrically simplified and each optimal implant placement was obtained is provided in additional files .fig.  <dig> principles of determination of optimal implant placement using the geometrically centered method. a example of simplification of a bone corridor into a pyramidal shape  using roi points  placed in 3d-vr mode. an optimal implant can be positioned using an axis centered within the pyramid . b this centered axis is determined in 3d-mpr mode using roi points  as landmarks and geometrical shapes  . d: dorsal; cd: caudal. roi points in other colors correspond to different implant sites



determination of optimal implant 3d coordinates by manual measurements
each implant direction was defined using  <dig> proja on anatomical planes, which were used as 3d coordinates . it is important to note that projections onto anatomical planes are not identical between c <dig> and c <dig> because of the significant range of motion existing between these vertebrae. in this study, a projection on c <dig> anatomical planes was operated for c <dig> implants and respectively for c <dig> implants. transarticular implants involving c <dig> and c <dig> were defined using c <dig> projections. osirix™ allowed determination of the proja by aligning 3d-mpr planes with anatomical planes. this was achieved by identifying  <dig> anatomical plane and  <dig> anatomical axis. for both c <dig> and c <dig>  the sagittal plane was defined as the plane of symmetry of the vertebra which was determined in 3d-mpr mode. then, an anatomical axis was identified in the sagittal plane to complete the alignment of all  <dig> planes. for c <dig>  the ventrodorsal axis was defined as the sagittal cranial border of c <dig> dorsal and ventral arches. for c <dig>  the craniocaudal axis was defined as the sagittal ventral border of the c <dig> vertebral foramen . once anatomical alignment was obtained in 3d-mpr mode, proja could be measured manually by centering the intersection of the  <dig> planes on the insertion point followed by shifting the plane of interest until the exit point was visualized .fig.  <dig> manual measurement of proja using osirix™. a sagittal, transverse and dorsal proja can be used as the implant 3d coordinates. b to determine proja using osirix™ 3d-mpr mode, the  <dig> planes are first aligned with the anatomical planes . c proja measurement is obtained by shifting the plane of projection from the insertion point  to the exit point  of the studied implant . v: ventral; d: dorsal; r: right; l: left; cr: cranial; cd: caudal



estimation of the safety margins of each osic by manual measurements
in order to provide an estimation of the safety margins associated with each implant site, we developed a new method considering both the bone margins and the diameter of the implant used. the general principle of the method was to study the bone corridor associated with each optimal implant site in  <dig> subjectively defined orthogonal planes using osirix™ 3d-mpr mode. in each of these planes,  <dig> safety margins were determined by rotating the central axis of the implant away from the optimal position around the insertion point until the implant position became considered unsafe . bone purchase was considered inappropriate when the virtual implant central axis reached a line tangent to the inner surface of the near  vertebral cortex. vital structures included the spinal cord, nerve roots or blood vessels passing through or in between c <dig> and c <dig>  these structures were delineated in ct images by the vertebral, lateral, alar, transverse and intervertebral foramen. the first point encountered along each rotation of the implant that was causing it to become unsafe was identified by placing an roi point representing a safety margin of the bone corridor. for sagittal implants directed toward the vertebral canal, 75 % of the corridor length was used to position safety margin points. this method allowed identification of  <dig> safety margin points for each bone corridor. safa could then be determined using the optimal implant roi points, the safety margin roi points and circles simulating the implant diameter as demonstrated in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> manual method of determination of safa using osirix™ 3d-mpr mode. first,  <dig> orthogonal planes containing the safety margin points  are identified. the intersection of these  <dig> planes simulates the implant site . then, circles of the same diameter as the simulated implant are positioned around the safety point . tangent lines to each circle passing through the insertion point are used to measure safa 



mathematical determination of optimal implant 3d coordinates and osic safety margins
the methods of determination of proja and safa described above were considered excessively time consuming to apply on a large sample size and to be used routinely in the clinical setting. given that we intended to study multiple implant sites in approximately  <dig> dogs, we elected to develop a method of mathematical calculation of these angles that would be more time efficient. all mathematical calculations were performed using microsoft® excel software. <dig> the calculations were based on the ct 3d coordinates of the roi points simulating the optimal implants and their respective safety margins. an open-source osirix™ plugin <dig> allowing exportation of 3d coordinates into microsoft® excel was used to optimize the process and limit the risk of error while transferring the 3d data.

mathematical determination of proja required advanced vectorial calculations . briefly, each optimal implant was considered as a vector oriented from its insertion to exit point. the coordinates of these points provided by the ct scan could not be directly utilized for proja calculations. instead, a change of coordinate system  was performed to provide vector coordinates defined with respect to the anatomical axes. this was achieved by defining anatomical coordinate systems for c <dig> and c <dig> using  <dig> roi points strategically selected in the sagittal plane of each vertebra . once the coordinates of the vector were determined with respect to the anatomical axes, the proja could easily be calculated using standard trigonometric equations . each step of the calculations was then entered into a microsoft® excel sheet semi-automating the process.fig.  <dig> trigonometric equations used for proja calculations based on anatomical coordinates. a anatomical coordinate systems were defined for c <dig> and c <dig> by positioning  <dig> points  in the sagittal plane of each vertebra. the point o represents the origin of the coordinate system, while  represents the craniocaudal axis . b geometrical demonstration of sagittal , dorsal  and transverse  proja  calculation based on anatomical coordinates  of a vector ie→




mathematical equations for calculation of the safa could be established through trigonometry as depicted in fig. 5a. the ct coordinates of the safety margins roi points could be used without any change of basis, as these angles are defined with respect to the axis of the optimal implant. the diameter of the implant used had to be known to calculate safa. the same safety margin roi points could also be used to estimate the width of the bone corridor in both orthogonal planes as depicted in fig. 5b. an example of the spreadsheet with all pre-entered equations for all  <dig> implant sites is provided as an additional file .fig.  <dig> geometrical demonstration of safa and osic width calculations. a method of safa calculation;  method of osic width calculation. in the schematics, the ie segment represents the optimal implant position  and the s point is the safety margin identified on ct images by rotating the axis of the implant around its insertion point until the position is considered unsafe. the insertion point , exit point , safety margin , and radius of the implant  are all known entities



mathematical model validation and estimation of angle measurement errors
in order to validate our semi-automated method of determination of proja and safa, a complete osic simulation was performed by  <dig> author  including simulation of  <dig> optimal implants , safety margins  and c1/c <dig> anatomical axes  in all dogs. a sample of  <dig> dogs was then randomly selected within the recruited population and  <dig> implant was randomly selected for each dog using random numbers generated with sas onlinedoc® software. <dig> prior to any angle measurements and calculation, the roi points simulating the selected optimal implant and its associated anatomical coordinate system and safety margins were imported in osirix™ for each dog. these roi points were then used to determine  <dig> proja and  <dig> safa mathematically and compared to measures obtained manually for each of the  <dig> selected implants. the manual measures were obtained by  <dig> observers  and repeated after a 1-week interval. for determination of safa, implant diameter was subjectively set at  <dig>  mm. agreements between the calculated values and manual measures and 95 % tolerance limit intervals were determined to validate the mathematical model.

in order to estimate the error generated by the operator when measuring proja and safa manually, calculated values were considered as gold standard. the measurement error was determined for each observer by calculating the absolute difference between the manually measured and calculated values.

in order to estimate the error on proja measurements generated by the operator when identifying the anatomical axes,  <dig> roi points representing the anatomical coordinate systems of c <dig>  and c <dig>  were positioned by  <dig> observers  with  <dig> repeats in all  <dig> dogs. this provided  <dig> sets of  <dig> rois per dog, each representing the same anatomical axes with a slight variation due to operator variability. to estimate the effect of this variability on proja values, all previously determined roi points representing all of the studied implant sites  were imported into osirix™ for all  <dig> dogs. for each implant site,  <dig> proja were calculated  <dig> times based on the  <dig> coordinate systems obtained by the  <dig> observers. because the exact position of the anatomical axes cannot be objectively determined, the mean of the  <dig> repeats of each proja values was used as gold standard for that part of the study. agreements and absolute error between each of the  <dig> obtained values and the gold standard as well as 95 % tolerance limit intervals were determined to estimate the proja calculation error. agreements and 95 % tolerance limit intervals were also determined between observers, between repeats and within subsamples  in order to identify the most significant sources of error.

statistical analysis
agreements between different methods of angle determination  and between repeated measures were obtained using the bland-altman method and concordance correlation. this method also allowed calculation of 95 % tolerance intervals, representing the range of values that would theoretically be obtained for a single measure with 95 % probability. these values estimated the reproducibility of the method which is defined as the degree to which repeated measurements provide similar results  <cit> . statistical analysis of the data was performed using statistical software sas onlinedoc®. statistical significance was set at a maximum p value of  <dig> .

RESULTS
sampled population and ct images acquisition
over the recruitment period,  <dig> dogs were recruited to participate in this study. the recruited population differed slightly from the initial objective and included  <dig> mature beagle dog cadavers,  <dig> toy breed dogs with a normal aa joint and  <dig> toy breed dogs affected with aai. one unaffected toy breed dog was 3 weeks younger than our inclusion criteria but was not excluded given the ct images revealed complete fusion of the vertebral growth plates suggesting the aa region had reached adult stage. ct images of the craniocervical junction were successfully obtained in  <dig> dogs using the pre-established protocol. in  <dig> aai dogs, the slice thickness was set at  <dig>  mm instead of  <dig>  mm due to a protocol error.

definition of aa osics and simulation of optimal implant 3d positions
the online search of the literature identified  <dig> pertinent references . upon review of these references,  <dig> safe bone corridors were defined corresponding to anatomical parts of the aa vertebrae. these bone corridors included the lateral masses , ventral arch , cranial articular surfaces , cranial vertebral body , pedicles  and caudal vertebral body . each corridor was simplified into a geometrical shape, including pyramids, prisms and hemi-ellipsoids . the general principle used to simulate optimal implants was to identify well-defined centered axes of the geometrical shapes . in addition, a transarticular optimal implant position was defined  using the lateral mass corridors to define its axis and the ventral surface of c <dig> to position its insertion point. for the caudal vertebral body corridor,  <dig> different centered implant positions could be defined. therefore in total,  <dig> optimal implant sites could be objectively defined . for implants located in the sagittal plane, a traditional method was used by identifying  <dig> point of the optimal axis within the sagittal plane which was then used in 3d-mpr mode to center the implant axis .fig.  <dig> simulation of  <dig> optimal implants using geometrical simplification of aa bone corridors 



the method of osic analysis was used successfully in all  <dig> cases although some limitations were observed while positioning roi points. even though osirix™ 3d modes generated continuous 3d space, roi points placed in 3d-mpr or 3d-vr modes remained associated to specific slices. in other words, the space located between each slice could not be represented using roi points. another seemingly random difficulty encountered in 3d-vr mode was an occasional software glitch when placing roi points. instead of positioning the point on the visible bone surface, the point would be placed on the opposite side of the vertebra. this malfunction could be overcome by positioning the vertebra so that the bone surface of interest was tangent to the operator view.

discussion
this study provides a detailed description of a new method of aa osic analysis using osirix™. this method overcame the problem of subjective optimal implant placement definitions. three-dimensional simplification of bone corridors into geometrical shapes not only permitted the description of corridors of complex / oblique distribution, but also to objectively localize the optimal implant position in space. for the transarticular osic, the geometrical determination of the corridor centered axis was based on the c <dig> lateral masses while the insertion point was located on the c <dig> cranial articular surface. some occasional issues were encountered when placing roi points in 3d-vr mode in some cases but they did not preclude successful osic simulation in any case. this step was the most time consuming and could not be automatized. improvement in 3d surgical planning software would be necessary to allow such automation.

for the determination of numerical values describing 3d optimal implant placements and bone corridor characteristics, we developed a semi-automated procedure relying on the 3d coordinates of pre-identified roi points. this study demonstrated excellent concordance between the semi-automated mathematical calculations and manually measured values which validated our first hypothesis. our data also implied that safa and proja could be accurately obtained using osirix™ measurement tools, although this would be more time consuming compared to the semi-automated method. similar concordance analysis revealed that positioning of the landmarks used for anatomical space modeling induced low errors . it should be emphasized that this source of error is inherent to the use of proja values as 3d coordinates. similar limitations are encountered when using neuronavigation based on fiducial markers  <cit> . based on our results, landmark induced error can be significantly reduced if  <dig> observers position the roi points successively and the mean of the  <dig> obtained proja values is used instead of an individual value. regardless, the observed range of error of only a few degrees was considered small given that a minimum 15–20° bone corridor angular width would likely be necessary to recognize a corridor as acceptably safe. a theoretical error in any roi positioning was expected of up to half the ct study slice thickness  which would also have a low impact on most of the osic calculated values. this type of error could have been minimized by reformatting all ct studies to  <dig>  mm slice thickness.

overall, these results validated our second hypothesis, allowing us to conclude that the use of osirix™ with implementation of mathematical equations on exported 3d coordinates was an efficient and reproducible tool which could be applied on a larger scale to describe aa osics. the major advantage of the described method is it can generate 3d data defined with respect to anatomical coordinates. such data could be used for applications beyond osic descriptions. for instance, 3d data can be used to study the biomechanics of complex motions between vertebral motion units or to characterize pathological range of motion such as observed in aai. another possible application of this type of analysis would be to develop software able to automatically reduce aa subluxation at the planning stage. this type of 3d anatomical realignment would be extremely helpful to optimize implant positioning for each individual patient and compare different stabilization constructs such as plating systems or other customized implants in virtual 3d space.

these clinical applications all heavily rely on the definition of anatomical coordinate systems. consequently, a good understanding of these definitions and how angle projections are made is essential. identification of the sagittal plane is the most intuitive step to define a proja as it is also the plane of symmetry of the vertebra. an anatomical axis is then needed within that plane to define a proper coordinate system. in a previous report, the craniocaudal axis for c <dig> was defined as the ventral border of the vertebral foramen, which is what was also used in our study  <cit> . to our knowledge, a similar axis had not yet been described for c <dig>  therefore, we subjectively defined the cranial border of the dorsal and ventral arches as representing the ventrodorsal axis. the implicit assumption was that these c <dig> and c <dig> anatomical axes would have good alignment when the aa joint is placed in neutral position. further investigation on the neutral position of the aa joint would be necessary to assess the accuracy of that assumption. misalignment of the anatomical axes could result in clinically significant consequences when placing c <dig> implants. indeed, only a very small portion of c <dig> can be visualized intraoperatively which means that estimation of c <dig> implant 3d position in surgery is mostly based on landmarks present on the ventral surface of c <dig>  fortunately, this type of misalignment would have limited impact on the risk of vertebral canal violation  as it would only affect the implant direction along the sagittal plane, not lateromedially.

one significant limitation in our study was the small number of recruited dog suffering from aai, the population of clinical interest. however, most implant positions were simulated using the exact same protocol in all  <dig> groups. one notable difference in methodology in the aai group was the fact that the insertion point of transarticular implants normally placed on c <dig> ventral surface had to be approximated due to aa misalignment. in contrast aa misalignment did not affect transarticular implant directions nor their proja values as they were solely defined using c <dig> landmarks . overall, the low number of aai cases could affect certain descriptive values such as the estimated length of transarticular implants but was not expected to have any significant impact on the optimal implant direction nor the reproducibility of our method.

neuronavigation can be defined as a group of techniques designed to target neuroanatomical structures intraoperatively using 3d data obtained via advanced imaging. these methods include frame-based systems where the 3d space is defined with respect to a rigid frame, and frameless systems which require more advanced intraoperative 3d calculations, but allow for greater freedom of movement for the surgeon  <cit> . in veterinary medicine, neuronavigation represents a promising technical advancement in surgical accuracy, even though it remains cost-prohibitive for most clinical practices. the main alternative to neuronavigation is precise pre-surgical planning. the free open-source dicom software osirix™ was initially developed by a human radiologist to improve multidimensional navigation and display of large datasets generated by advanced imaging modalities such as pet-ct or cardiac ct  <cit> . the accuracy and reliability of the software have been validated experimentally and compared to other image analysis programs . good accuracy and low measurement error of the software have been demonstrated which is critical for surgical planning of implant placement with narrow safety margins. osirix™ rapidly became a successful 3d navigation tool due to its extremely fast and optimized 3d graphics. more recently, several publications in human medicine have reported its use for fast pre-surgical planning, notably in emergency situations where advanced neuronavigation planning is considered excessively time consuming  <cit> . in our study, osirix™ proved relatively intuitive, and overall easy to use. the method presented here is currently relatively cumbersome due to the necessity to export 3d data in a separate software. however, osirix could be complemented with pre-surgical planning tools through the development of plugins incorporating mathematical equations similar to those we used in our study. this would allow generating optimal implant placement definitions considering individual morphological variations of the patient. precise calculations of such coordinates may improve surgical accuracy; however, this would require the development of intraoperative guiding systems able to use these values to position implants in vivo.

without such guiding system the precise coordinate values provided by our method would remain difficult to apply to actual patients as intraoperative implant positioning would still rely on the surgeon’s ability to reproduce these values in vivo. current neuronavigation techniques are difficult to use in the aa region of toy breed dogs due to the small operation field and limited space available for fiducial markers. therefore, our group has developed a 3d drill guide device using proja values to help the surgeon estimate optimal implant position intraoperatively, although investigation of the accuracy of the device will be necessary. in any case, we expect that the method of determination of osics presented here may improve accuracy of implant positioning.

CONCLUSIONS
individual anatomical variations are becoming more commonly recognized in the canine population, and therefore the need for individualized pre-surgical planning will likely be increasing. neuronavigation is an appealing solution to this problem, but such advanced technology remains currently inaccessible to most veterinary practices. this study described a novel semi-automated method of osic analysis using osirix™ dicom viewer software. geometrical simplification of bone corridors could be applied in the most commonly reported implant sites used for ventral aa stabilization. the method of calculation of proja and safa was successfully validated by comparing the results to manually measured values. the principles described in our method could be further developed as an interactive preoperative/intraoperative planning tool for individualized surgical planning of spinal fixation.
