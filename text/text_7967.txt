BACKGROUND
the human pathogen legionella pneumophila causes a severe pneumonia so-called legionellosis or legionnaires’ disease ; this gram negative bacterium was identified after the  <dig> philadelphia outbreak during the american legion convention where  <dig> people succumbed  <cit> . further outbreaks were associated with aerosol-producing devices like showers, cooling towers, whirlpools and fountains, but rowbotham was the first to show a link between legionella ecology and ld  <cit> . actually, l. pneumophila is ubiquitous in aquatic environment and is able to multiply intracellularly in fresh water protozoa.

l. pneumophila displays  <dig> serogroups but the majority of human cases are due to the serogroup <dig>    <cit> . lp <dig> is frequently found in the environment and accounts for 28% of environmental isolates in france. other legionella species, as l. anisa, l. dumoffii and l. feeleii that frequently colonize the water distribution systems, are rarely involved in human disease  <cit> . these data suggest that the high frequence of ld involving lp <dig> is not due to its predominance in the environment but rather linked to a higher virulence than other species or serogroups of legionella. the only exception is legionella longbeachae accounting for 30% of human cases in australia and new-zealand, and even 50% of cases in south australia  <cit> . in contrast to l. pneumophila, l. longbeachae is found predominantly in potting soil and transmitted by inhalation of dust of contaminated soils.

a lot of attention has been paid to the identification of lp1virulence factors. it is now recognized that the co-evolution between eukaryotic hosts and l. pneumophila had led to the selection of a set of virulence factors which allow this bacterium to exploit host cellular processes; among these factors, eukaryotic-like proteins, encoded by genes identified on the basis of genome sequence analysis, are involved in different steps of the legionella intracellular cycle  <cit> . recently, comparison of legionella genome sequences has shown that some genes encoding the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis were specific of lp <dig> and constitute specific markers for the molecular typing  <cit> .

we focused our attention on the identification and virulence capacities of different serogroups of l. pneumophila strains present in the french thermal spa where five cases of legionellosis were diagnosed in  <dig>  following by two cases in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in order to determine the source of infection, water samples had been collected throughout the water distribution system as well as the three natural springs  and two bore holes feeding the system. eighty one l. pneumophila strains belonging to five serogroups  had been identified from water samples collected over a two-year period ; thus this water system appeared mainly contaminated by lp <dig> and lp <dig>  also present in two natural spring . nevertheless, comparative analysis of genomic dna, by pfge , of both clinical lp <dig> isolated from patients and environmental lp <dig> isolates did not allow identifying the source of infection.

in this study, our goal was to identify legionellae directly virulent towards protozoa and as a consequence with the ability to survive in a specific environment, like the spring s characterized by a temperature of 37°c and a high level of sulphates and thiosulphates as the calcium and sodium salts  <cit> . thus, we isolated legionellae from natural biofilms developed on glass slides immersed in this contaminated spring. after typing by different approaches, the dna genome diversity of these environmental lp strains was analyzed, and their virulence and cytotoxicity towards the amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii were compared to those of well-known french clinical isolates .

RESULTS
phenotypic analyses and serotyping of environmental l. pneumophila isolates
legionella cells developed in natural biofilms in the spring s were extracted according to the french afnor nft90- <dig> procedure as described in material and methods. independent bacterial colonies developed on gvpc in  <dig> days at 37°c were screened according to a fritted glass appearance with a green gleam. this assay provided us  <dig> isolates named laxa from the campaign of august  <dig> and  <dig> isolates named laxb from december  <dig> . then, serotyping was performed with two different latex agglutination tests  consisting of blue latex particles sensitized with specific rabbit antibodies of different serogroup  antigens of l. pneumophila. these tests allowed us to show that all legionella strains we isolated from biofilms belong to the specium pneumophila and to three sg  with the following distribution:  <dig> lp <dig>   <dig> lp <dig> and  <dig> lp <dig> . at this stage, we were not able to characterize  <dig> strains by serotyping . besides, the  <dig> environmental positively serotyped lp isolates also displayed an auxotrophy for cysteine, a known characteristic of legionellae . interestingly, analysis of the catalase activity of these  <dig> lp strains allowed us to show that lp. strains were characterized by a very weak production of gas bubbles  from the substrate h2o <dig>  actually, l. pneumophila displays two genes, kata and katb, encoding catalase-peroxidases, but functionaly theses enzymes exhibit only the peroxidatic activity  <cit> . by contrast l. anisa and l. micdadei  and e. coli dh5α  were able to generated rapidly numerous gas bubbles  and l. longbeachae and l. taurinensis were characterized by a clear gas emission but at a significantly lower rate than l. anisa. thus, the cat- phenotype can be considered as a good tool for screening l. pneumophila strains among legionella genus  <cit> .

* nsr: no serotyping reaction.

§ nd: not determined.

dna analysis and molecular diversity of environmental l. pneumophila strains
molecular typing of the all environmental isolates allowed us to confirm the classification obtained by serotyping . actually, we used current standards in molecular diagnosis of the genus legionella: mip gene , 16s rrna genes  <cit> . both genes were amplified by pcr from bacterial lysates of the  <dig> environmental isolates. then, the discrimination of the specium pneumophila was performed by amplifying the gene lpg <dig> <cit> . finally, lp <dig> typing of seven environmental legionellae was obtained by independent gene amplifications of lpg <dig> and wzm   <cit> : laxa <dig>  laxb <dig>  laxb <dig>  laxb <dig>  laxb <dig>  lab <dig> and laxb <dig> .

thus, the laxb environmental strains we isolated from the spring s mainly belong to lp <dig>  and to a lesser extend to lp <dig>  and lp <dig> ; it is interesting to underline that the isolate laxb <dig> was classified as l. pneumophila only at the molecular level, and not by serotyping which could suggests a new serogroup. with regard to the laxa strains, lp <dig>  and lp <dig>  were also identified, but lp <dig> was not detected. two isolates, laxa <dig> and laxa <dig>  were classified as non legionella species and were indeed further identified as mycobacterium isolates on the basis of their 16s rrna sequences using a different set of 16s rrna primers . the small number of lp isolated in the laxa campaign does not allow to draw any conclusion about the persistence of lp between august and december  <dig> 

in order to assess the molecular diversity, dna of  <dig> laxa and laxb strains  was analyzed by pfge and led to the identification of five main patterns . it is clear that these five patterns are different from those of other known l. pneumophila clinical isolates as lp <dig> strains lorraine, biarritz and paris  but also lp <dig> lens, philadelphia and corby . it is interesting to stress that lp <dig> and lp <dig> strains were grouped in two independent specific patterns . by contrast, the  <dig> lp <dig> strains were differentiated in three distinct patterns  which suggest a genomic diversity.

in order to assess more finely this molecular diversity, the mip sequences of  <dig> l. pneumophila strains were determined and compared. all mip sequences were performed on both strands and no mismatch was identified. the  <dig> sequences comparison the led us to identify three different types of mip sequence, so-called mip <dig>  mip <dig> and mip <dig>  these sequences exhibit a high identity  and only differ by few substitutions :  <dig> substitutions between mip <dig> and mip <dig> sequences,  <dig> between mip <dig> and mip <dig> and a unique substitution between mip <dig> and mip <dig>  it must also be underlined that these three mip sequences are very close to those of known clinical isolates , and the mip <dig> sequence is even completely identical to the mip sequence of the lp <dig> clinical strain corby . actually, this sequence-based classification not only confirmed results obtained with other typing approaches  but also allowed us to position the different environmental strains within the specium pneumophila . analyses of mip sequences confirmed the homogeneity of lp <dig> strains belonging to the unique pulsotype pst <dig> and characterized by a unique mip sequence  . besides, this approach revealed a genetic diversity within the five lp <dig> strains belonging to the pulsotype pst <dig> but differentiated by two mip sequences, mip <dig> and mip <dig>  finally, a high genetic diversity was also observed within pst <dig> and pst <dig> pulsotypes, where the environmental lp <dig> strains could be discriminated according to the three mip sequences .

*laxb <dig> was positioned into the class  <dig> according to serotyping and mip sequence.

cytotoxicity to acanthamoeba castellani
alamar blue was used to quantify the viability of remaining amoeabae after legionella infection  and the cytotoxicity was assessed by percent of killed amoebae. the mean cytotoxicity of lp <dig> clinical strains  was estimated to  <dig> and 73% after 24 h and 48 h post-infection, respectively. as expected, the avirulent mutant dota, derived from the strain lens  <cit>  did not display any significant cytotoxicity . environmental strains isolated from the source s appeared much more cytotoxic than lp <dig> clinical strains, especially at  <dig> post-infection: actually environmental lp <dig>  lp <dig> and lp <dig> are characterized by a cytotoxicity of 100% whatever their pulsotype  or their mip sequence  .

virulence towards acanthamoeba castellani
lp <dig> clinical strains involved in ld outbreaks  and the worldwide epidemic and endemic strain paris were used as virulent references.  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> extracellular clinical lp <dig> cells were present in  <dig> μl samples taken after a 24 h and 48 h period of a. castellanii infection, respectively . in the same periods, legionella cells released from amoeba cells infected with the dota mutant were 100-fold less numerous. interestingly, the number of extracellular legionellae cells resulting from amoeba infections with environmental strains was very close to that of clinical lp <dig> with the exception of extracellular lp <dig> strains associated with a 10-fold increase after a 48 h-period of infection. no significant difference of virulence was observed between the different classes of environmental lp <dig> at 48 h post-infection, even if some strains appeared to present a weak delay of virulence at 24 h post-infection .

a co-infection experiment was also conducted in a. castellanii with two representative strains of lp <dig>  and lp <dig>  environmental isolates. duplex pcr analysis  of extracellular bacteria revealed that 95% of  <dig> clones analyzed belonged to lp <dig> strain , indicating the rapid and advantageous development of this lp <dig> strain in competition to the lp <dig> strain.

discussion
our original approach of isolation of l. pneumophila cells from natural biofilms allowed to extend the knowledge of legionellae populations contaminating a french alpine thermal spa where several successive cases of ld occurred from  <dig> to  <dig>  other previous studies had reported the presence of five sg  of free-living l. pneumophila isolated from water samples collected in different sites of the spa  <cit> .

in contrast to these previous results, our work revealed that the sg  <dig> appears as the major population of l. pneumophila in biofilms developed within the spring s, a very original environment; besides, our results suggest that the  <dig> environmental lp <dig> we isolated correspond probably to a unique strain; actually, all these lp <dig> isolates could not differentiated at the dna level  or at the level of cytotoxicity towards acanthamoeba castellanii. all these data raise the hypothesis of a probable recently-emerged lp <dig> strain with a capacity of rapid development in this specific environment, and more particularly within protozoa present in the spring s. this hypothesis is also supported by the co-infection experiment that pointed out the potential advantage of lp <dig> strain in competition with lp <dig> strain during amoeba infection. this probable emergence of lp <dig> gives also an explanation to the absence of detection of lp <dig> free-cells in water samples analyzed in other reports  <cit> . the absence of lp <dig> from the laxa strains we isolated in august  <dig> could suggest an emergence of this strain in the spring s between the month of august and the month of december.

a similar hypothesis could be drawn for the sg  <dig>  also absent from previous reports related to this thermal spa; the five lp <dig> environmental isolates also characterized by a unique pulsotype ; however, differences in two mip sequences  strongly suggests two lp <dig> strains also recently appeared well-adapted in this site.

in contrast to lp <dig> and lp <dig>  environmental lp <dig> strains were already described in water samples collected from the three springs that fed the thermal spa. unfortunately, lp <dig> previously isolated from this thermal spa in  <dig> and  <dig> were no longer available; as a consequence, it is not possible to determine if the five classes of lp <dig> we isolated result from a genetic evolution from a unique or several parental strain. interestingly, the three distinct dna patterns of environmental lp <dig> were original and quite different of other known lp <dig> clinical isolates involved in outbreaks. besides, these environmental lp <dig> were characterized by a higher toxicity and virulence towards amoebae than the lp <dig> clinical isolates implied in outbreaks. at this stage, the possibility of a virulence decrease of lp <dig> clinical isolates resulting from numerous times transfers in the laboratory cannot be ruled out. however, in our hands, no attenuation of virulence has been pointed out during the past  <dig> years. we can suppose that this high virulence of environmental isolates to amoebae is in relation with a long-term persistence of lp <dig> probably in biofilms within the spring s. it is now recognized that the intracellular multiplication of lp <dig> in amoebae enhanced their capacity of virulence towards alveolar human macrophages  <cit> . taking into consideration their very high virulence capacity, these environmental lp <dig> strains constitute good candidates for the recurrent ld observed in this french thermal spa. moreover, the high virulence trait of lp <dig> strains isolated in the spring s must also be taken into consideration. indeed, a lp <dig> strain has already been involved in a legionnaires disease in the past  <cit> . the whole-genome sequence of this clinical isolate lp <dig> strain 570-co-h has been recently characterized  <cit> . however, high virulence in amoebae does not completely correlate to high virulence in humans. thus, higher virulence of environmental strains  compared to references lp <dig> outbreaks strains does not absolutely mean higher risk of legionellosis. this hypothesis needs to be validated by further studies to assess the virulence of these environmental isolates towards human macrophages.

CONCLUSIONS
this study highlights the role of mixed biofilms  of a site in the multiplication of virulent legionellae. indeed, it has demonstrated the high virulence of environmental legionella pneumophila serotype  <dig> isolates towards amoebae, a natural host in water spring; this is known to enhance legionella virulence trait towards human macrophages. moreover, it has shown the persistence capacity of legionella pneumophila species in such an ecosystem. finally, it also pointed out the biodiversity of legionella pneumophila in their natural environment.
