BACKGROUND
studying the expression and intracellular localization of transcription factors is a difficult task because both may be highly dynamic. this is precisely the case for otx <dig>  mouse otx <dig> is a paired-class homeobox gene that belongs to a gene family also containing otx <dig> and the more divergent crx  <cit> . it plays critical roles in early brain induction and development  <cit> . it is expressed in a very dynamic fashion in areas of the central nervous system  that rapidly change as development proceeds  <cit> . several germinal and conditional knock-out studies have emphasized its involvement in multiple functions such as head formation  <cit> , photoreceptor fate determination  <cit>  or post-natal survival and growth  <cit> .

despite the great number of genetic models generated to address its activities, there is still a need for tools to study the complex dynamics of expression of this gene in the cns. indeed, one major problem is the lack of specific otx <dig> antibody. the strong sequence similarity between otx <dig> and otx <dig> has made it difficult to raise specific sera, the use of which is therefore particularly delicate  <cit> . the distribution of otx <dig> protein has been first investigated during mouse development  <cit>  with a polyclonal serum that was later shown to cross react with otx <dig> protein  <cit>  and then in newborn rats  <cit> . in adults, aside from few studies such as in the retina  <cit> , no general study has been carried out. as a result, unambiguous otx <dig> expression data mostly rely on mrna detection  <cit> . otx <dig> in situ hybridization  is widely used to characterize the patterning and development of anterior neuroectoderm. however, several studies have raised the possibility of translational regulation at gastrula stage  <cit> , and recent work suggested that otx <dig> specific mirna decay might time the generation of retinal neurons  <cit> . therefore, true otx <dig> expression analysis should rely on protein rather than mrna detection. several lacz reporter lines have been created  <cit>  but due to probable deletion of splicing and regulatory sequences  <cit>  or mrna nonsense mediated decay, none of them allowed the complete monitoring of otx <dig> gene expression. in addition, these models do not allow the precise determination of otx <dig> protein intracellular localization. yet, this appears to be tightly regulated in the developing retina  <cit> . moreover it would be interesting to be able to examine otx <dig> expression and detailed localization, and to identify directly otx2-expressing cells, in live tissues.

to overcome these difficulties, we have generated a new mouse line harbouring a gfp tag within otx <dig> natural genome context. genetic modifications were made to ensure as a normal expression as possible. this line allowed to visualize the full otx <dig> development pattern and to discover an unexpected control of otx <dig> protein subcellular localization.

RESULTS
generation of an otx2+/otx2-gfp reporter line
in order to clearly identify otx <dig> expressing cells during mouse development and throughout life, we created a new allele bearing the mugfp coding sequence  <cit>  in frame with otx <dig> coding sequence . we had previously shown that fusing the gfp polypeptide both at n- and c-terminus of otx <dig> does not modify its in vitro localization, dna binding, and transcription properties  <cit> . we chose a c-terminal gfp fusion, and put an excisable neo selection cassette immediately downstream the gfp stop codon. since subtle modifications of the otx <dig> 3'utr coding region result in impaired mrna translation in early embryos  <cit> , we took particular care to keep this part of the gene as intact as possible. after homologous recombination of the targeting molecule in es cells, neo selection cassette was removed by flp recombinase mediated excision, leaving behind a single frt site between gfp stop codon and otx <dig> 3'utr . all steps of homologous recombination and neo excision were monitored by appropriate pcr and southern blot analyses .

recombinant es cells were injected into recipient blastocysts to generate the otx2+/otx2-gfp transgenic line. chimaeric males were obtained who transmitted the otx2otx2-gfp allele  to their offspring.

hypomorphic phenotypes in otx2og/og animals
unexpectedly, the breeding of otx2+/og mice yielded only 4% living homozygous and fertile otx2og/og offspring , meaning the otx2og allele is hypomorphic. this was surprising for two reasons. first, otx <dig> and otx2-gfp protein display identical activities in vitro  <cit> . second, otx2og/+ × otx2+/+ crosses yielded 50% heterozygous animals , whereas in the 129/sv background, only 30% hemizygous otx2+/- newborn survive  <cit> . to check for defects in homozygous embryos, mice were sacrificed at various gestational stages. homozygous embryos were found in mendelian proportions up to birth , but showed variable facial abnormalities . this evoked a problem of gene dosage or protein activity. western blot analysis of e <dig>  heterozygous embryos showed comparable amount of otx <dig> and otx2-gfp proteins, indicating a similar expression level of both alleles . thus, activity rather than quantity of otx2-gfp protein must be rate limiting, though subtly since it is sufficient to achieve complete mouse development in a small proportion of animals.

to understand in which manner and when this activity could be limiting, we explored the major early functions of otx <dig> in homozygous otx2og/og embryos. it is known that this gene controls anterior visceral endoderm  movement and subsequent gastrulation  <cit> , but morphological examination showed no obvious difference between otx2og/og and otx2og/+ embryos up to e <dig>  . this indicates that ave migration and gastrulation proceeded normally. by contrast, we could observe variable brain reduction from e <dig>  on . otx <dig> is required in the anterior neuroectoderm to properly receive signals from the anterior neural ridge  and to maintain forebrain development  <cit> . six <dig> is a good indicator of forebrain response to anr induction. in e <dig>  otx2og/og embryos of mild or strong phenotype, six <dig> was expressed, confirming normal forebrain induction and maintenance . as otx <dig> itself monitors forebrain maintenance, otx2-gfp fluorescence present in every phenotype confirmed an established forebrain identity. it is well known that otx <dig> controls the compartmentalization and maturation of the forebrain and midbrain  <cit> . in particular, it is necessary to set the midbrain-hindbrain boundary . although a slight anterior shift of fgf <dig> expression could not be completely excluded, fgf <dig> and gbx <dig> pattern showed no obvious alteration , indicating that the mhb was correctly established. on the contrary, the en <dig> domain, which normally labels mesencephalon, appeared shifted close to the telencephalon and was reduced in strong phenotypes, showing partial or complete disappearance of diencephalon and mesencephalon respectively – in all cases, however, six <dig> expression showed that telencephalon developed normally . altogether, these data demonstrate that otx2-gfp protein activity possesses most essential activities of native otx <dig>  but that it may in some instances be rate limiting for diencephalon and mesencephalon maturation. interestingly, analysis of surviving homozygous otx2og/og adults showed no obvious difference with heterozygous animals. for instance photoreceptor cells of the retina, which are highly sensitive to otx <dig> expression  <cit> , appeared normal in otx2og/og adults . to assay for photoreceptor cells health status, we performed immunostaining of the glial fibrillary acidic protein  in glial müller cells. this protein is up regulated in müller cells in a variety of degenerative conditions  <cit> . the absence of marked gfap induction in otx2og/og retina confirmed that photoreceptors were healthy thus demonstrating the functionality of otx2-gfp protein in these neurons. for the sake of animal care simplicity, heterozygous animals were used for the continuation of this study.

expression pattern in otx2+/og animals
to test whether the otx2+/og mouse line is an accurate reporter of otx <dig> gene activity, we analyzed otx2-gfp expression pattern. first, early expression of the transgenic allele was studied by direct fluorescence observation of e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos. as expected, strong gfp fluorescence was detected in the embryonic part of e <dig>  otx2+/og embryos and became regionalized toward the anterior pole in e <dig>  embryos . as otx <dig> translation in epiblast has been shown to be very sensitive to locus modification  <cit> , we wondered whether otx2-gfp was correctly expressed both in epiblast and anterior visceral endoderm . to verify this, we observed sections of e <dig>  embryos. indeed, nuclear otx2-gfp was found in both layers . this expression pattern matches exactly the one described for endogenous otx <dig> gene  <cit> .

otx2-gfp protein was then analyzed in developing heterozygous embryos between e <dig>  and e <dig>   and compared to otx <dig> mrna pattern. again, the dynamics of otx2-gfp protein expression paralleled that of otx <dig> mrna at all stages. in line with this, we noticed at e <dig>  and e <dig>  a rapid decrease of otx2-gfp protein in telencephalic areas where mrna was down-regulated. transverse sections across developing sensory organs of e <dig>  embryos show gfp signals in olfactory epithelium, eye and inner ear  that are characteristic of otx <dig> pattern, indicating that otx2-gfp products recapitulate endogenous otx <dig> expression.

we then addressed otx2-gfp expression at later stages. this was of particular importance because a previous reporter line failed to express ß-galactosidase beyond e <dig>   <cit> . in e <dig>  sections, as expected again, expression was found in olfactory epithelium, diencephalon, roof of mesencephalon, and choroid plexuses . in p <dig> brain sections, this expression was maintained. we also identified a diffuse group of otx2-gfp positive cells in the basal telencephalon . furthermore, our line allowed to easily visualize gradients of otx <dig> expression: such was the case in superior colliculus , where superficial optic layers showed stronger labelling than deep layers, and in cerebellum with high posterior to low anterior labelling of the external granular layer . in adults, very strong labelling could still be seen, among other locations, in choroids plexuses, thalamus as well as sc . thus, the otx2og allele appears to be functional from early development till adulthood. to evaluate the sensitivity of detection of the otx2-gfp protein based on the direct fluorescence emitted by gfp, we compared it with that based on immunostaining using an anti-gfp antibody and a secondary fluorescent antibody. as shown in figure 5k–m for neurons in the thalamus , both methods detect the same number of otx2-gfp positive neurons. similar observations were made in the retina and superior colliculus . we conclude that virtually all sites of otx <dig> protein expression can be recorded by direct observation of the gfp fluorescence in the otx2+/og mouse line. use of amplification reactions might of course further reveal sites of otx <dig> expression, particularly at the subcellular level.

otx <dig> is located at the inner face of nuclear envelope in retinal photoreceptors
we then wondered whether otx2-gfp intracellular localization exhibits a regulation similar to the one of native otx <dig> protein. in adult mouse retina, a previous study using immunofluorescence with an otx <dig> antibody described the protein as nuclear in retinal pigment  and bipolar cells, but cytoplasmic in photoreceptor  cells  <cit> . in embryonic chick retina, the protein was found in the nuclei of photoreceptor cells  <cit> . we therefore used otx2-gfp to carefully examine cellular localization of otx <dig> protein in the retina of adult mice using confocal microscopy. as expected, otx2-gfp was distributed throughout the nuclear space in rpe cells and in cells located at the outermost part of the internal nuclear layer  , which correspond to bipolar cells  <cit> . in photoreceptor cells, which have very little cytoplasm around their soma, otx2-gfp appeared to surround the pr nuclei, but we could not determine whether it was excluded or not from the nucleus. to resolve this issue, we labelled the nuclear envelope with lamin-b and lamin a/c antibodies . this showed diffuse strictly nuclear localization for otx2-gfp in rpe cells and bipolar cells , but also in prs – in these cells, the protein concentrated at the periphery of the nuclei, facing the inner nuclear envelope . to rule out the possibility of an artefact due to gfp as the cause of this unexpected protein distribution in pr cells, we analyzed native otx <dig> localization in prs of wild type mice by immunofluorescence using an anti-otx antibody  together with an anti-lamin-b antibody. as there is no reported otx <dig> gene expression in prs, we interpret the anti-otx signal as the detection of otx <dig> protein. we obtained the same result as with otx2-gfp , demonstrating that otx <dig> protein definitely adopts a perinuclear location in photoreceptors.

discussion
we have generated a new mouse line which is unique for direct visualisation of otx <dig> gene activity. until now, no other reporter line existed that sustains otx <dig> driven expression from early embryonic stages to adulthood. as a result of the knock-in fusion strategy in the mouse otx2og/+ line, the otx2-gfp protein is expressed at physiological levels and appears to display most activities and subcellular localization as normal otx <dig> protein. in addition, it provides a straightforward mean to discriminate otx2- from otx1-expressing cells throughout the mouse brain. homozygous otx2og/og animals may develop normally but often show mild diencephalic and mesencephalic maturation defects. interestingly, this reveals that these structures are the most demanding ones for otx <dig> activity, in line with the frequent ocular and brain defects found in heterozygous mice and human mutants  <cit> . the strong signal to noise ratio of the gfp provides a convenient readout of the otx <dig> gene dynamics of expression even in living animals. furthermore, using the otx2og allele in combination with modified versions of genes controlling anterior neuroectoderm patterning and development will provide a simple way to monitor normal and perturbed cellular movements.

there is increasing evidence that beyond elaborated control of expression through regulation of transcription by complex enhancers, developmental genes may see their function further modulated by other posttranscriptional mechanisms. here, the expression of gfp-tagged otx <dig> from its endogenous locus helped us to unravel cell-specific control of protein localization within the retina. using the mouse otx2og/+ line, we disclosed that in adult pr cells, otx <dig> protein is not cytoplasmic as previously thought, but restricted to a small volume at the inner periphery of nuclei. interestingly, similar tight regulation of localization was found for the rod photoreceptor specific nuclear receptor nr2e <dig>  <cit> . the significance of such an unusual location for a transcription factor is presently mysterious. the inner face of nuclear envelope gathers silent heterochromatin but also highly expressed dna domains at the vicinity of nuclear pores  <cit> . the protein could be sequestrated at the periphery of the pr nucleus in order to regulate the amount of free active otx <dig> in the nucleoplasm. alternatively, all otx <dig> proteins at the periphery of the nucleus could be transcriptionally active, bringing loops of dna containing otx2-regulated genes to the vicinity of nuclear pores to facilitate mrna export. indeed, the chromatin appears to be least condensed at the nuclear periphery of photoreceptor cells  <cit> . fish analysis of otx <dig> target gene should test this hypothesis. another possibility is that a specific fraction of chromatin resides at the edge of the nucleus, to which otx <dig> and other transcription factors, such as nr2e <dig> would be associated. among the questions raised by this study are the following: when does this pattern take place during pr differentiation and does it have a specific role in pr genetic expression and function ? conditional ablation of otx <dig> function in mature pr will certainly bring interesting answers to these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
the methodology presented here describes the gfp tagging of an important transcription factor from its own gene locus. this leads to the creation of transgenic animals where both tissue and cell specific gene expression as well as precise intracellular protein localization can be easily followed. the established line allows to monitor the complete expression pattern of otx <dig> gene during mouse life without any interference from otx <dig> gene products. its sensitivity leads us to identify peculiar aspects of otx <dig> protein expression and cellular localization. this last aspect reveals a new level of regulation for developmental gene products – cell-type dependent control of intra-nuclear distribution – which should be taken into account in future studies.
