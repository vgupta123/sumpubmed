BACKGROUND
endogenous small rnas  are known to be important regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. they fall into a number of different classes in plants: transacting sirnas , heterochromatin-associated sirnas, natural antisense sirnas  and mirnas  <cit> . these classes of non-coding rnas are distinguished by their biogenesis pathways and the types of genomic loci from which they arise  <cit> .

mirnas are non-coding rnas of approximately  <dig> nucleotides that have been identified as important regulators of gene expression in both animals and plants  <cit> . plant mirnas are generated from hairpin-structured non-coding transcripts by dcl <dig>  which cleaves a short  duplex from the stem region  <cit> . the duplex is incorporated into an ago <dig> complex and the mirna* strand is subsequently degraded. the mature mirna strand guides the ago <dig> complex  to protein-coding rnas, which are cleaved by ago <dig> at a specific position   <cit> . recent findings have shown that the inhibition of gene expression via translational arrest by the mirna-guided ago complex is more common in plants than was previously believed  <cit> . the mature mirnas function within large complexes to negatively regulate specific target mrnas. plant mirnas generally interact with their targets through perfect or near-perfect complementarity and direct mrna target degradation  <cit> . due to their evolutionary conservation, mirnas have been found to exist in both plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit> . conserved mirna molecules can also be found in ferns, mosses and fungi  <cit> .

in plants, mirnas not only post-transcriptionally regulate their own targets but also interact with each other in regulatory networks to affect many aspects of development, such as developmental timing  <cit> , senescence  <cit> , leaf morphogenesis  <cit> , reproductive development  <cit> , and modulation of root architecture  <cit> . mirnas are also reported to be involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . to date an increasing number of mirnas have been identified and deposited in mirbase v <dig>  . among these mirnas, there are  <dig>  plant mirnas and mirnas*, from a total of  <dig> species. the species with the fastest growing number of mirnas is brachypodium distachyon, with  <dig> mirnas being recently added. initially, mirnas were identified by the traditional sanger sequencing method, which used for relatively small-size cdna libraries of plant srnas from arabidopsis, rice and poplar . comparison of mirnas from these species led to the conclusion that plant mirnas are highly conserved  <cit> . this was supported by observations that even ferns shared common mirnas with flowering plants  <cit> . however, it was also noticed that a small number of mirnas were not present in the genomes of some species, suggesting that they have evolved more recently  <cit> . as non-conserved mirnas are often expressed at a lower level than conserved mirnas, many non-conserved mirnas were not found in small-scale sequencing projects. however, high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of many non-conserved mirnas in several species  <cit> . to date, hundreds of mirnas have been isolated by direct cloning or by deep sequencing in higher plants  <cit> . elucidating the function of these tiny molecules requires efficient approaches to identify their targets. originally, plant mirna targets have been studied via computational prediction, which is based on either perfect or near -perfect sequence complementarity between mirna and the target mrna or sequence conservation among different species  <cit> . however, target prediction is very challenging, especially when a high level of mismatches exists in mirna:target pairing  <cit> . recently, a new method called degradome sequencing, which combines high-throughput rna sequencing with bioinformatic tools, has been successfully established to screen for mirna targets in arabidopsis <cit> . using degradome sequencing, many of the previously validated and predicted targets of mirnas and tasirnas were verified  <cit> , indicating that it is an efficient strategy to identify srna targets on a large scale in plants.

rape  is one of the most important oil crops, and also is one of the major economic crops. however, unlike arabidopsis and other plants, much less is known about its mirna classification and mirna targets, especially the roles of mirnas in the developmental process of brassica napus. currently, mirbase lists  <dig> mirnas forming  <dig> mirna families in brassica napus. the exploration of srna-based regulatory networks in brassica napus is an important step towards our better understanding of srna-based genic regulation. here, we describe the high-throughput sequencing analysis of srnas from a cultivated variety of b. napus, cv westar, using the illumina solexa platform.

the srnas library was prepared for solexa sequencing from greenhouse cultivated rape plants, and produced more than  <dig> million unique sequences. the most abundant classes were represented by  <dig> and  <dig> nt-long srnas. forty-one conserved b. napus mirnas and  <dig> candidate novel b. napus-specific mirnas were firstly identified. twelve conserved mirnas and  <dig> b. napus-specific candidates were further verified by real-time rt-pcr. to identify mirna targets, a degradome sequencing approach was used, which globally identifies the remnants of srna-directed target cleavage by sequencing the 5′ ends of uncapped rnas  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> non-redundant target ests for  <dig> conserved mirnas, and  <dig> non-redundant target ests for  <dig> b. napus-specific mirnas. approximately 70% of the identified targets for conserved mirnas were transcriptional factors.

RESULTS
sequencing b. napus mirnas using solexa technology
we used solexa technology to deeply sequence b. napus srnas. total rnas from different b. napus tissues were pooled and submitted for small rna sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated from the sequencing machine. after removing adaptor sequences, filtering out low quality tags and cleaning up sequences derived from adaptor-adaptor ligation,  <dig> , <dig> unique sequences were obtained. among these unique sequences,  <dig>   were found to be similar to known mirnas .

a the sequences are filtered out if they contain  <dig> ns  and only a and c without g and t, vice versa; b the simple sequences are filtered out if they contain  <dig> ns ,  <dig> consecutive as,  <dig> consecutive cs,  <dig> consecutive gs or  <dig> consecutive ts and  <dig> repeats of any dimer,  <dig> repeats of any trimer, or  <dig> repeats of any tetramer. these numbers were from the statistics of mirbase ver <dig> 

srnas with known function were commonly 20– <dig> nt in size  <cit> ; therefore, we analyzed the size distribution patterns of the original and unique reads . the majority of srnas were  <dig> nt in size, followed by  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt , which is consistent with the typical size distribution of srnas from other plants. the  <dig> nt class showed the highest redundancy, whereas the  <dig> nt class showed lower redundancy .

identification of conserved b. napus mirnas
conserved families of mirnas are found in many plant species and have important functions in plant development and responses to stresses  <cit> . in this study, to identity the conserved mirnas in b. napus, our dataset was mapped onto the the genome and ests of b. napus, b. rapa and b. oleracea, allowing one or two mismatches between sequences. all retained sequences were compared to known mirnas from mirbase  <dig>  , and secondary structures of these matched mirnas were predicted. based on genome mapping and the mirbase results and hairpin prediction, a total of 55conserved mirnas derived from b. napus were identified, including  <dig> mirnas and mirnas*  were firstly identified together with  <dig> already in mirbase . 41conserved mirnas and mirnas* were potentially generated from  <dig> non-redundant ests and  <dig> genomic survey sequence  loci . the precursors of four mirnas named bna-mir166f, bna-mir824*, bna–mir1140b and bna–mir1140b* were matched in the genome of b. rapa .

the read number of the conserved mirnas was highly variable, indicating different expression levels of these mirnas. among them, bna-mir <dig>  bna-mir166a, bna-mir <dig>  bna-mir171f and bna-mir <dig> had relatively high number of reads, indicating that these mirnas are likely to be expressed at a higher level, whereas bna-mir <dig> family members had a low number of reads, and are, therefore, likely to be expressed at a lower level . the relative expression level of a few known mirna families, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were similar to that of arabidopsis <cit>  .

brassica-specific mirnas
a distinct feature of mirnas is the ability of their pre-mirna sequences to adopt the canonical stem-loop hairpin structure. after removal of conserved mirnas, the rest srna reads were predicted for each mapped locus for potential stem-loop structures. from this analysis, we identified  <dig> mirna and mirna*candidates  that were potentially generated from  <dig> est or gss loci .

generally, new species-specific mirnas are considered to be young mirnas that have evolved recently, and are often expressed at a lower level than conserved mirnas, as was reported for arabidopsis and wheat  <cit> . this observation is also true for many of the new b. napus mirnas identified here. however, few new mirnas were expressed at a high level, which was opposite with this observation . in some cases we observed considerable inconsistency between the level of mirnas identified by solexa sequencing and quantitative rt-pcr  analysis, however, though we do not know the explanation for these differences. it is possible that the primers used for stem-loop real-time reactions can bind mirna species with a few mismatches that were not considered by the bioinformatic analysis.

stem-loop qrt-pcr validation and measurement of b. napus mirnas
to verify the existence of the newly identified rape mirna candidates, the same rna preparation used in the solexa sequencing was subjected to stem-loop qrt-pcr  <cit> . finally, twelve conserved mirnas and  <dig> brassica-specific candidates, which were randomly selected, could be readily detected by qrt-pcr , suggesting that mirnas are bona fide mirnas. most results of qrt-pcr analysis agreed with the sequencing data, as in the cases of bna-mir <dig>  bna-mir159b, bna-mir160a, bna-mir165a, bna-mir166e, bna-mir167f, bna-mir169a, bna-mir171a*, bna-mir390d, bna-mir <dig>  bna-mir1140b, bna-mirc <dig>  bna-mirc5- <dig>  bna-mirc5- <dig>  bna-mirc17a- <dig>  bna-mirc <dig>  bna-mirc <dig>  bna-mirc22a- <dig>  bna-mirc <dig> and bna-mirc <dig>  in some cases, however, a discrepancy was also observed between the qrt-pcr and sequencing data . the results suggested that solexa sequencing was capable of successfully discovering candidate novel mirnas from this species with high accuracy and efficiency.

targets of known b. napus mirnas
in b. napus, many conserved mirna targets have been predicted previously  <cit> , but few mirna targets were identified experimentally. we therefore employed the recently developed high-throughput experimental approach  <cit>  allowed us to identify target genes for known mirnas and candidate new mirnas identified in this work. the poly-a fraction of a balanced total rna mix from leaf, petiole, stalk and root tissue was analyzed for the identification of target transcripts of known and new mirnas. we obtained a total number of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> reads with an average size of ~ <dig> nt, representing the 5′ ends of uncapped, polyadenylated rnas. after initial processing,  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained, and could be mapped to mrnas. previous studies established that the 5′ terminal nucleotide of mirna-cleaved mrna fragments would correspond to the nucleotide that is complementary to the 10th nucleotide of the mirna. therefore, the cleaved rna targets should have distinct peaks in the degradome sequence reads at the predicted cleavage site relative to other regions of the transcript  <cit> . cleaveland pipeline  <cit>  was used to identify cleaved targets for both known and new mirnas in b. napus. the abundance of the sequenced tags was plotted for each transcript, and the results are shown in figures  <dig>  additional file 6: figure s <dig> and additional file 7: figure s <dig>  the cleaved target transcripts were categorized into five classes . there were  <dig> non-redundant ests identified as known mirnas targets, covering  <dig> mirna families . nine target ests were classified as category  <dig> . category  <dig> targets are transcripts where the degradome reads corresponding to the expected mirna-mediated cleavage site were the most abundant reads matching the transcript and there is only one peak on the transcript with more than one raw read at the position. transcripts of one target  fall into category  <dig> , where the total abundance of degradome sequences at the cleavage position is equal to the maximum on the transcript, and there is more than one raw read at the position and more than one maximum position on the transcript.  <dig> target ests were classified as category  <dig> , where abundance at the cleavage position is less than the maximum but higher than the median for the transcript and more than one raw read at the position.  <dig> target ests were classed as category  <dig> , where abundance at the cleavage position is equal to or less than the median for the transcript and more than one raw read at the position. among the identified targets the most abundant category was category  <dig> , where there is only one raw read at the cleavage position . using these classifications we identified targets for  <dig> conserved mirna families out of  <dig>  many highly conserved mirnas were identified in b. napus  did not have detectable sliced targets in the degradome sequencing data . it is possible that the levels of conserved mirnas  or sliced targets are below the detection level in this growth stage, and may be present in other specific stages or tissues that have not yet been analyzed. alternatively, these mirnas inhibit target gene expression through translational arrest rather than mrna cleavage.

most of the identified targets of the conserved b. napus mirnas belong to diverse gene families of transcription factors, such as spls, arfs, mybs, nf-y subunits, nac-domain proteins, ap2-like factors, scls and mads-box factors . many of these transcription factors are known to regulate diverse aspects of plant growth and development. for example, spls and ap2-like factors targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, have been shown to play an important role in phase changes  in arabidopsis <cit> . another important family of transcription factors is the mads-box gene family,which is known to play a critical role in determining organ specificity during flower development in arabidopsis <cit> . one mads-box gene  was validated as a target for mir <dig> in b. napus . mads-box factors in b. napus have also been identified to play important roles in petal identity  <cit> . similarly, three scl6s targeted by mir <dig> play an important role in the regulation of shoot branch production in arabidopsis <cit> . besides their possible involvement in plant development, mirna targets identified in this study could also play fundamental roles in biotic and abiotic stress resistance in b. napus. nf-ya transcription factor genes were validated as targets of for mir <dig> family numbers. the atnf-ya <dig> transcription factor, whose transcript is a target of mir <dig>  has been implicated in drought stress responses in arabidopsis <cit> . over-expression of a mir169-resistant atnf-ya <dig> transgene significantly improves drought resistance by promoting stomatal closure under drought stress  <cit> . furthermore, nf-ya factors in petunia hybrida and antirrhinum majus were validated to play important roles in floral organ identity  <cit> . nf- ya mrnas were identified as targets of mir <dig> in b. napus . in addition, laccases , plantacyanin-like proteins  and f-box proteins involved in auxin-stimulated protein degradation  were among the confirmed targets in b. napus . bna-mir <dig> is a brassica-specific mirna identified in our previous work.

brassica-specific mirna targets
out of the  <dig> candidate new mirnas, we only identified targets for only  <dig> mirnas from the degradome sequencing data, plus  <dig> non-redundant target ests for candidate new brassica-specific mirnas . the abundance of the sequence tags for candidate brassica-specific mirna target transcripts was plotted as a function of its position in the target genes . we found there was no clear correlation between the expression level of the new mirnas and their ability to target an mrna for cleavage. we found candidate new mirnas, such as bna-mirc <dig>  bna-mirc <dig>  bna-mirc <dig>  target mrnas despite their low abundance and that target mrnas. consistent with our observation, no clear inverse correlations between the mirna abundance and the cleavage frequency of target transcripts in arabidopsis, rice and grapevine have been reported  <cit> . the new b. napus mirnas target different genes with a wide variety of predicted functions. for instance, bna-mirc <dig> targets chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene, bna-mirc20- <dig> targets photosystem ii reaction center w-like protein gene and bna-mirc <dig> targets photosystem i subunit xi gene, which are all involved in photosynthesis. bna-mirc17a- <dig> targets cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , which is likely to be involved in pathogen resistance and plant development  <cit> . several specific targets, such as ppr-containing protein , ferrochelatase , gf <dig> omega proteins , ftsh-like protease , glycosyl hydrolase family proteins , histone h2a and histone h2b  were found as targets of rape-specific mirnas in b. napus.

verification of mirna-guided cleavage of target mrnas in b. napus
to verify the mirna-guided target cleavage, rlm-race experiment was performed to detect cleavage product of  <dig> predicted bna-mirnas . as shown in figure  <dig>  all five of the bna-mirnas guided the target cleavage, often at the tenth nucleotide, or eleventh nucleotide . thus, all the five predicted targets were found to have specific cleavage sites corresponding to the complementary sequences of mirna.

CONCLUSIONS
here,  <dig> conserved data and  <dig> brassica-specific candidate mirnas, including  <dig> mirna* sequences were firstly identified. the sequencing results were further confirmed using stem-loop quantitative rt-pcr. the data will be updated to incorporate future mirbase updates. our approach leads to the identification of several conserved and specific brassica mirna targets in the available est and genomic databases.  <dig> non-redundant mrna targets for the conserved brassica mirnas and  <dig> non-redundant mrna targets of new brassica-specific mirnas were identified. validated mirna targets in b. napus are potentially involved in diverse biological processes, including phase transitions, flowering, hormone signaling, photosynthesis, metabolism and biotic and abiotic stress resistance. our data will be a useful resource for further investigation of the evolution of small rna-based regulation in brassica napus and related species. more importantly, this study will serve as a foundation for future research on the functional roles of mirnas and their target genes in this important oil crop.
