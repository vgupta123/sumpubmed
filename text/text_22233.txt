BACKGROUND
staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococci  first described by freney et al.. in  <dig>  <cit>  and usually serves as an aetiologic agent of skin and soft tissue infections, mostly in the pelvic and inguinal regions  <cit> . in recent years, there have been a number of reports on invasive infections of s. lugdunensis resulting in destructive clinical outcome  <cit>  and this bacterium has become an increasingly important virulent human pathogen  <cit> . while s. lugdunensis can cause infections in multiple tissues, including the skin, soft tissue, bone marrow, peritoneum, central nervous system, blood, endocardium, and joints  <cit> , it primarily infects blood, joints, skin, and soft tissue. the blood infection rate of s. lugdunensis is around  <dig> %  <cit> , which is lower than most other bacteria. however, there are an increasing number of reports on blood infections caused by this bacterium  <cit> .

the prevalence of s. lugdunensis varies greatly among different geographical regions, including  <dig> % in japan  <cit> ,  <dig> % in korea  <cit> , 3% in the u.s.  <cit> , and 6% in argentina  <cit> . while it is suspected that the incidence of this bacterium in asiatic countries is similar, its incidence has not yet been investigated in china. one reason for the low detection and underappreciated infection rates of s. lugdunensis are that most clinical microbiology laboratories do not usually speciate cons  <cit> . therefore, accurate methods are needed in order to accurately determine incidence by speciation of cons isolates. while frank et al. suggested that ornithine decarboxylase  and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase  tests could identify s. lugdunensis from cons  <cit> , tan et al. showed that these two tests could only be used as a preliminarily screen for the bacterium  <cit> . currently, it is believed that the sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding  gene can be used to accurately identify s. lugdunensis <cit> . additionally, the current problem of drug resistance in cons isolates is severe  <cit> . the rate of drug resistance of s. lugdunensis varies throughout the world and while it is susceptible to most antibiotics, there are case reports on its resistance to some drugs  <cit> .

the objectives of the present study were to determine the frequency of s. lugdunensis in  <dig> non-replicate cons clinical isolates from the general hospital of the people’s liberation army in china and to clinically and microbiologically characterize them. specifically, we determined drug resistance patterns and molecular epidemiological characteristics, contributing to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of s. lugdunensis infections.

RESULTS
detection of s. lugdunensis isolates
eight out of the  <dig> isolates were positive for both odc and pyr . isolate  <dig> and  <dig> were positive in the latex agglutination test; however, only isolate  <dig> was positive in the slide coagulase test. all isolates were negative in the subsequent tube coagulase test. of these eight isolates,  <dig> were further validated by both vitek  <dig> gp and api  <dig> staph, with a sensitivity of 80% , one could not be accurately identified by either, and the other  <dig> were identified as s. haemolyticus . the sequences of the gap gene for all  <dig> isolates were 99% identical to the corresponding s. lugdunensis sequence  . hence, five out of the  <dig> cns isolates were detected as being s. lugdunensis, a detection rate of  <dig> % . of the of five s. lugdunensis isolates identified, one was obtained from the venous blood of a patient with influenza, one was from the synovial fluid of a patient with a joint infection, three were from secretions  of patients with skin and soft tissue infections .

-ve in latex agglutination test signifies no noticeable clearance of the blue background in the latex test; -ve in slide coagulase test signifies no visible clumping or clotting using either saline or plasma; -ve in tube coagulase test signifies no clot by the end of  <dig> hours or following  <dig> hours incubation a room temperature.

characterization of drug resistance in the s. lugdunensis isolates
kirby-bauer  disc diffusion tests showed that among the five isolates of s. lugdunensis, three were resistant to erythromycin , clindamycin , and penicillin , one was resistant to cefoxitin and penicillin and positive for β-lactamase, and one was susceptible to all antimicrobials and negative for β-lactamase . e-test results indicated that the  <dig> isolates were susceptible to vancomycin  . results for control strains for both methods were within the reference ranges. the ermc resistance gene was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> isolates of s. lugdunensis, as determined by pcr amplification . none of the isolates had erma or ermb genes , whereas the meca gene was present in one isolate . the pcr results are summarized in figure 2c.

pfge did not reveal widespread diversity among the isolates
after smai digestion and electrophoresis, genomic dna fragments were well separated and  <dig> to  <dig> dna electrophoretic bands were produced . a cluster dendrogram did not reveal widespread diversity, with similarity among the five isolates ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %; two pairs of isolates were  <dig> % and  <dig> % similar and one isolate had below  <dig> % similarity to the other isolates .

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of prevalence of s. lugdunensis in clinical specimens obtained from mainland china. an earlier case of s. lugdunensis was reported in a 31-year-old chinese patient  in singapore in  <dig>  <cit> . recently, community acquired s. lugdunensis were reported in clinical infections associated with co-morbidities in southern taiwan  <cit> ; however the study did not observe widespread antimicrobial resistance even though there was widespread genetic diversity in the confirmed isolates. in the current study, our detection rate was  <dig> % , which is comparatively on the lower end  <cit> , but similar to what has been reported in korea  <cit> .

in the revised manuscript, we have described in details  what –ve  signifies for the tube coagulase, slide coagulase, and latex agglutination test, respectively.

the latex agglutination test and slide coagulase test are used for rapid identification or for ruling out staphylococcus aureus. however, some staphylococcus isolates produce a membrane-bound form of the clumping factor, which can yield a positive result in slide coagulase and/or rapid latex agglutination tests, thus requiring the confirmatory tube coagulase test. however, an isolate that is positive in the latex agglutination test has a high probability of a positive slide coagulase test and our assay for isolate  <dig> does not conform to this, whereas isolate  <dig> does. in addition, recent results have shown that the prevalence of the fibrinogen-binding adhesion  is 100% in staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates  <cit> . however, one recent study reported that of the  <dig> staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates studied, though fbl gene could be detected in all cases, only 47% gave a positive slide coagulase test result  <cit> . this perhaps suggests that varying levels of fbl gene product dictates the apparent sensitivity of staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates to slide coagulase test. on comparing the results for isolate  <dig> and  <dig> , they differ markedly in drug resistance and β-lactamase expression, with isolate  <dig> being susceptible to all drugs tested and the only isolate not expressing β-lactamase. it is difficult to say whether the fbl gene expression pattern dictates this apparent difference between these isolates; however, it will be very interesting to see in the future if there is any difference in sensitivity to latex agglutination and slide coagulase test based on fbl gene expression in staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates.

we used pyr and odc tests to preliminarily screen cns isolates, vitek  <dig> gp and api  <dig> staph to validate, and gap gene sequence to confirm s. lugdunensis isolates. there are  <dig> cons species registered in genbank . the amplification of the partial gap gene for all of the staphylococcus species  yield a single product of nearly 931 bp  <cit> . the sequence similarity of the gap sequences ranged from  <dig>  to 96%  <cit> . in fact, in our analyses the second closest strain was s. haemolyticus , which has a gap gene sequence similarity of 27%  <cit>  with s. lugdunensis <cit> . we found that among the  <dig> isolates positive in both pyr and odc tests,  <dig> were s. lugdunensis and the other three were s. haemolyticus. this may due to s. haemolyticus being weakly positive for odc, which is consistent with previous results  <cit> .

of the  <dig> isolates of s. lugdunensis identified in this study,  <dig> were obtained from wound, breast, and cervix secretions, suggesting that skin and soft tissue infections account for a prominent number of the total infections caused by s. lugdunensis, which is consistent with previous results  <cit> . one isolate was from the synovial fluid of the patient with a joint infection. frank et al. reported that this bacterium infects artificially replaced joints  <cit>  and it accounts for 4% of all joint infections  <cit> . another isolate was from the venous blood of a newborn baby with pneumonia. tee et al. previously reported a case of neonatal pneumonia caused by this bacterium but that case suffered from a catheter-related blood infection  <cit> . consistent with previous results  <cit> , s. lugdunensis was not isolated from any sputum cultures in this study, which may be due to inability of this bacterium to colonize the respiratory tract.

four out of the five s. lugdunensis isolates identified in this study produced β-lactamase , which indicates an incidence of 80% that is much higher than the incidence in other countries  <cit> , including 7-24% in france, 24-40% in the u.s., 12% in spain, and 15% in sweden. of note, our small number of positive isolates might have potentially biased such estimations. only one out of the five isolates was not resistant to the antimicrobial drugs tested, three were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and penicillin, and one was resistant to cefoxitin and penicillin . we found that the three isolates resistant to erythromycin were positive for the ermc gene but not the erma or ermb gene; and the isolate resistant to cefoxitin was positive for the meca gene; the later was only reported a few times in the previous studies  <cit> . we further found that the rate of antibiotic resistance of s. lugdunensis is more severe in china than in other countries and primarily presented as multi-drug resistance, again such an inference might suffer from potential bias due to the sample size of the confirmed isolates.

we performed pfge in order to determine the epidemiological characteristics of s. lugdunensis in our hospital, even though the sample size was not ideal for accurately defining epidemiological characteristics. of note, smai-restricted s. lugdunensis in order to gain a band pattern is known to be more difficult compared to s. aureus due to methylation of smai sites  <cit> . these isolates were not typed due to the small sample size. however, a cluster dendrogram and clinical analysis still provide epidemiological characteristics. the two isolates with a similarity of  <dig> % were from a patient with a premature rupture of fetal membranes and a 14-day-old newborn. the isolate with a similarity of  <dig> % or less with other isolates was from the outpatient clinic. the two isolates with a similarity of  <dig> % were from the department of orthopedics, were both resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and penicillin and produce β-lactamase, suggesting that pfge can provide epidemiological information for s. lugdunensis from different departments.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, while the prevalence of s. lugdunensis in our study is low and warrants further investigations, it is of significant clinical concern that its rate of multi-drug resistance is so high. the diversity of s. lugdunensis by macrorestriction analysis with smai was limited for typing  but sufficient to consider that pfge with smai is suitable for epidemiological analyses. further studies encompassing detailed molecular methods similar to the current one will be required to characterize the nationwide prevalence and genetic diversity of the β-lactamase positive s. lugdunensis isolated in china.
