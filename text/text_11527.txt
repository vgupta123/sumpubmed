BACKGROUND
chitin is a homopolysaccharide chain of n-acetylglucosamine  units combined together with β- <dig>  glycosidic linkages. chitin is one of the most abundant biopolymers found in nature as constituent of fungal cell walls and exoskeletons of crustaceans and insects. however, the β-glcnac units that generally form intra- and intermolecular h-bonds make chitin completely insoluble in water and its use is thus limited. several strategies have been developed for converting chitin into small soluble derivatives, which are more useful for applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. enzymatic degradation of chitin using biocatalysts seems to be the method of choice since the type, quantity and quality of oligomeric products can be well controlled and the reaction occurs quickly and completely under mild conditions without generation of environmental pollutants.

chitinases  are a diverse group of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of insoluble chitin to soluble oligosaccharides. they are found in a wide variety of organisms including virus, bacteria, fungi, insects, plants and animals  <cit> . in the carbohydrate active enzymes  database , carbohydrate enzymes are first classified as glycosyl hydrolases , glycosyl transferases , polysaccharide lyases , carbohydrate esterases , and carbohydrate binding modules , and then further divided into numbered families with structurally-related catalytic and carbohydrate-binding modules. following this classification, chitinases are commonly listed as family gh- <dig> and family gh- <dig> enzymes. family- <dig> chitinases have the catalytic crevice located at top of the 8-tim barrel domain  <cit> , whereas the catalytic domain of family- <dig> chitinases comprises two lobes, each of which is rich in α-helical structure  <cit> . bacteria such as serratia marcescens, bacillus circulans, alteromonas sp. and marine vibrios produce chitinases to synergistically degrade chitin and use it as a sole source of energy  <cit> . the mechanism of chitin degradation by bacterial chitinases was mainly derived from the outcome of structural studies or site-directed mutagenesis  <cit> . unlike chitooligosaccharides, chitin polymer has been presumed to unidirectionally enter the substrate binding cleft of chitinases under the guidance of a few surface-exposed residues at the exterior of the substrate binding cleft  <cit> . those residues were identified as trp <dig>  trp <dig>  phe <dig>  and trp <dig> in s. marcescens chi a  <cit> , ser <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig>  and trp <dig> in aeromonas caviae chi <dig>  <cit> , and trp <dig> and trp <dig> in b. circulans chi a <dig>  <cit> . structurally, the latter two residues are located in the equivalent locations of tyr <dig> and trp <dig>  respectively of v. carchariae chitinase a . we previously isolated chitinase a from a marine bacterium, vibrio carchariae  <cit> . the enzyme was found to be highly expressed upon induction with chitin and was active as a monomer of  <dig> kda. the dna fragment encoding the functional chitinase a was subsequently cloned into the pqe <dig> expression vector that was compatible to be highly expressed in e. coli type strain m <dig>  <cit> . mutational studies confirmed that the conserved glu <dig> acts as the catalytic residue in the substrate-assisted mechanism  <cit> , whereas the aromatic residues including trp <dig>  tyr <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig> and trp <dig> participated in direct interactions with chitooligosaccharides  <cit> . in this study, site-directed mutagenesis was employed in combination with following chitin binding assays and kinetic analysis to investigate the significance of the putative surface-exposed residues ser <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig> and tyr <dig> for the binding and hydrolytic activities of the vibrio chitinase a.

RESULTS
homology modeling and sequence analysis
we previously reported gene isolation and sequence analysis of v. carchariae chitinase a precursor  <cit> . site-directed mutation of the active site residues showed that glu <dig> plays an essential role in catalysis  <cit> . on the other hand, the conserved aromatic residues  located within the substrate binding cleft of the enzyme were found to be important in binding to chitooligosaccharides  <cit> . here, we have investigated the functional roles of four amino acid residues  at the surface of v. carchariae chitinase a. all of these residues have been proposed as functionally relevant to binding and hydrolysis of crystalline chitin  <cit> . fig.  <dig> represents the modeled 3d-structure of v. carchariae chitinase a that was built based upon the crystal structure of s. marcescens chitinase a mutant e315l complexed with a chitohexamer . it can clearly be seen that the four residues linearly align with each other. trp <dig> and ser <dig> are positioned at the end of the n-terminal chitin binding domain , whilst trp <dig> and tyr <dig> are found outside the substrate binding cleft where they are part of the tim barrel catalytic domain.

when the amino acid sequences of several bacterial chitinases were compared, the v. carchariae chitinase a  exhibited highest sequence identity with chitinase a from v. harveyi hy <dig>  , moderate identity with chitinase a from s. marcescens  and enteromonas sp.  , and low identity with chitinase a <dig> from b. circulans . surprisingly, extremely low sequence identity was observed when v. carchariae chitinase a was compared with chitinase a from v. splendidus   and v. cholerae  .

a structure-based alignment of three chitinases, including v. carchariae chitinase a, s. marcescens chitinase a, and b. circulans wl- <dig> chitinase a <dig> was constructed and is displayed in fig. 2a &2b. fig. 2a represents an alignment of the n-terminal chbds of the vibrio and serratia chitinases with the c-terminal fragment that covers the chbd of the bacillus chitinase a <dig> . the chbdchia1consists of the residues  <dig> to  <dig> and deletion of this domain led to a severe loss in the binding activity to chitin as well as in the colloidal chitin-hydrolyzing activity, suggesting that this domain is essential for binding to insoluble chitin of this enzyme  <cit> . as shown in fig. 2a, the residues trp <dig> and trp <dig> of the chbdchia <dig> are well aligned with ser <dig> and trp <dig> of v. carchariae chitinase a. however, the determination of the solution structure of the chbdchia <dig> by ikegami et al.  <cit>  identified only trp <dig> as a putative chitin binding residue, in addition to his <dig>  thr <dig>  pro <dig>  and pro <dig> 

with respect to the alignment of the catalytic domain , trp <dig> of the vibrio chitinase is equivalent to trp <dig> and to phe <dig> of the bacillus and serratia chitinases. for tyr <dig>  this residue is replaced by trp <dig> and trp <dig> in the b. circulans and s. marcescens sequences, respectively. the sequence alignment additionally demonstrates the residues ser <dig> and trp <dig> within the flexible loops that join two strands in the chitin binding region. the residues trp <dig> and tyr <dig> are found as part of the catalytic  <dig> tim barrel, where tyr <dig> is exposed on the loop that joins helices  <dig> and  <dig> together and trp <dig> is the only residue being found in an α-helix ).

expression and purification of chitinase a and mutants
to investigate the binding and hydrolytic activities of v. carchariae chitinase a, target residues as named above were mutated by sited-directed mutagenesis. according to the employed system, the recombinant chitinases were expressed as the c-terminally  <dig> tagged fusion protein . after single-step purification using ni-nta agarose affinity chromatography, the yields of the purified proteins was estimated to be approx.  <dig> to  <dig> mg/ml per litre of bacterial culture. as analyzed by sds-page, all the mutated proteins displayed a single band of molecular weight of  <dig> kda , which is identical to the molecular weight of the wild-type enzyme.

effects of mutations on the chitin binding activities of chitinase a
to minimize hydrolysis, all the binding experiments were carried out on ice. bindings of the wild-type chitinase and mutants to colloidal chitin were initially investigated as a function of time. after a removal of the enzyme bound to chitin, decreases in concentration of the unbound enzyme remaining in the supernatant was monitored discretely at different time points of  <dig> to  <dig> min. fig.  <dig> demonstrates that the binding process took place rapidly and reached equilibrium within  <dig> min. the relative binding activity of each mutant to colloidal chitin is following the order w231a > s33w > wt ≅ w231f > s33a > y245w > w70a.

the binding activity of the individual mutants relative to the one of the wild-type enzyme was further examined with colloidal chitin and α-chitin polysaccharides at a single time point of  <dig> minutes. in general, the wild-type and mutant chitinases expressed greater binding activity towards colloidal chitin. a comparison of the level of binding of the engineered enzymes to the two substrates revealed a similar pattern . for both polysaccharides, w70a and y245w displayed lower binding activity than the wild-type enzyme. s33a and w231f showed a modest increase in binding to crystalline α-chitin and decreased level of binding to colloidal chitin. mutants s33w and w231a, on the other hand, displayed higher effectiveness in the binding to both substrates. of all, mutant w231a displayed highest binding activity and w70a exhibited lowest activity. especially, no detectable binding to crystalline α-chitin was observed with mutant w70a.

adsorption isotherms of chitinase mutants to colloidal chitin were carried out relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. fig.  <dig> represents a non linear plot of the adsorption isotherms obtained at a fixed concentration of colloidal chitin but varied concentrations of the enzyme . in comparison to the wild-type enzyme, mutants s33w and w231a exhibited significantly higher binding activity, whereas mutants w70a, s33a, w231f and y245w had a notably decreased binding activity. when the dissociation binding constants  were estimated from the non-linear regression function, it was found that the kd value of wild-type  was slightly larger than the kd values of s33w  and w231f , but remarkably greater than the value of w231a . in contrast, significantly higher kd values than the wild-type value were observed with s33a , w70a , and y245w . these estimated kd values gave a notation of the enzyme's binding strength in the following order w231a > s33w > w231f > wild-type > s33a > y245w > w70a, which is in absolute accordance with the binding activities determined by the chitin binding assay  and the kinetic data as described below.

effects of mutations on the hydrolytic activities of chitinase a
the effects of mutations on the hydrolytic activity of v. carchariae chitinase a were further studied by exposing the wild-type and modified enzymes to pnp- <dig>  colloidal chitin and crystalline α-chitin. the specific hydrolyzing activity for the three different substrates was subsequently determined. from all the mutants, only w231a displayed a slightly reduced specific hydrolyzing activity against the pnp substrate .

a one unit of chitinase is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases  <dig> μmol of  <dig> or  <dig> nmol of pnp per min at 37°c.

b values in parentheses represent relative specific hydrolyzing activities .

c non-detectable activity.

unlike the pnp-glycoside, strong effects on the hydrolytic activities were observed with the insoluble polymeric substrates. the hydrolyzing activity against crystalline α-chitin was completely abolished in case of mutants s33a, w70a and w231a/f but improved for mutants s33w and y245w at levels of 166% and 250% of the wild-type activity, respectively. a similar trend was also seen with colloidal chitin. however, for this substrate s33a, w70a and w231a/f not completely abolished but markedly decreased hydrolyzing activity, while s33w  and y245w  again where the ones that displayed higher activity than wild-type enzyme. the most severe loss of the specific hydrolyzing activity towards colloidal chitin was detected for mutant w70a, which had a substitution of trp <dig> to ala.

steady-state kinetics of chitinase a and mutants
the kinetic parameters of the hydrolytic activity of chitinase a and mutants were finally determined with chitohexaose and colloidal chitin as substrates. as presented in table  <dig>  mutations of the chosen residues led for the response of enzyme values towards the hexachitooligomer to concomitant decreases in both the km and kcat values. for all the mutants, however, the overall catalytic efficiency  was not much different to the value observed for the wild-type enzyme. in contrast, the kinetic properties of the enzyme against colloidal chitin were significantly modified by the mutations. the km values of s33a , w70a , and y245w  were higher than the wild-type km  whereas s33w  and w231a  had considerably lower km compared to the reference value. mutations that caused a large decrease in the enzyme's catalytic activity, kcat, were ser <dig> to ala, trp <dig> to ala and trp <dig> to ala/phe, whereas mutations of ser <dig> to trp and tyr <dig> to trp elevated kcat values instead. the overall catalytic efficiency  that was calculated for the hydrolysis of colloidal chitin was to more or less extent either reduced  or increased .

a relative catalytic efficiencies  are shown in parentheses.

discussion
this study describes the possible role of ser <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig>  and tyr <dig> in chitin binding and hydrolysis. point mutations of these residues were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and changes in the binding and hydrolytic activities of the enzyme as a result of the amino acid substitution were subsequently investigated for various substrates. chitin binding assays  demonstrate a decrease in the binding activity of mutants s33a, w70a and y245w to various extents. however, the most severe effect was observed with w70a. a time course study displayed no binding activity of w70a but retained activity of other mutants to colloidal chitin . this strongly suggested that trp <dig> is the major determinant for insoluble chitin binding. sugiyama and colleagues previously employed the reducing-end labeling technique and the tilt micro-diffraction method  <cit>  to illustrate the molecular directionality of crystalline β-chitin hydrolysis by s. marescens chitinase a and b. chitinase chitinase a <dig>  if the chitin polymer enters the substrate binding cleft of v. carchariae chitinase a from the reducing end as described for the serratia and bacillus enzymes, trp <dig> will likely serve as a platform for the arrival of a chitin molecule. this idea is well complimented by the location of the residue at the end of chbd. a remarkable loss of the specific hydrolyzing activity as well as the decrease in the rate of enzyme turnover  that was observed for mutant w70a is hence explainable by the loss of the binding strength due to a substitution of trp to ala and an associated change in the hydrophobic interactions. a similar performance was seen for residue ser <dig>  although to a lesser extent, a mutation of ser <dig> to ala also led to decreased binding activity, while its mutation to trp improved binding activity. this finding provides additional evidence that binding of the chitin chain to the chbd is cooperatively taken place via hydrophobic interactions and influenced by the molecular setting in this region.

the most striking observations were made with the residue trp <dig>  as demonstrated by the modeled 3d-structure , the residue trp <dig> is placed at the outermost of the catalytic surface, thereby lying closest to the non-reducing end of the substrate binding cleft. the observed drastic improvement  in the binding efficiency of mutant w231a could only be explained as a removal of the side-chain blockage. hence, the reduced hydrolyzing activity of mutant w231a was unlikely influenced by changes in the binding acitivity as a result of the alanine substitution of trp <dig>  apparently, the same phenomenon was previously recognized in s. marcescens chitinase a  <cit> , with which a mutation of phe <dig> to ala seriously diminished the hydroyzing acitivty but left the binding activities to both colloidal chitin and β-chitin microfibrils unchanged.

when the next residue in line   was mutated to a bulkier side-chain , inverse effects  were observed. this complimented the idea of the binding barrier around the entrance hall of the catalytic domain by trp <dig> and tyr <dig>  similar findings were also recognized with a cellulose degrading enzyme, thermobifida fusca endoglucanase   <cit> . with this enzyme, it was observed that mutations of the surface-exposed cellulose binding residues arg <dig> and glu <dig> to ala  led to a severe loss in the hydrolytic activity against crystalline cellulose, but a change in the binding activity was not at all observed. structurally, the residues arg <dig> and glu <dig> are found on the surface of the cellulose binding module , closest to the catalytic binding cleft of cel9a. therefore, the effects of arg <dig> and glu <dig> would be explained in analogy to those of trp <dig> and tyr <dig> in v. carchariae chitinase a.

in marked contrast, observations made with the vibrio trp <dig> mutation were different to the studies of li et al. on a. caviae chi  <dig>  <cit>  and of watanabe et al. on b. circulans chi a <dig>  <cit> . mutations of trp <dig> and trp <dig>  or trp <dig> and trp  <dig>  to alanine resulted in a marked loss in both binding and hydrolyzing acitivities, especially againts crystalline β-chitin. therefore, the reduced hydrolytic activities were assumed to be associated with the weaker binding of the two corresponding residues. based on their mutational data, the residues seemed to participate directly in binding to crystalline chitin, and subsequently cooperatively assisting the chitin chain to penetrate through the catalytic cleft of a. caviae or b. circulans chitinase.

indeed, the above-mentioned event that took place in the a. carviae and b. circulans chitinases did not seem to be the case for the v. carchariae chitinase a due to different behaviors of trp <dig> and tyr <dig> found for the vibrio enzyme. our data suggested that a possible action of v. carchariae chitinase a on insoluble chitin could proceed as follows: i) initial binding of a chitin chain to the chbd. this process is most influenced by the hydrophobic interaction set between the incoming sugar and residue trp <dig>  which is located at the doorway of the chbd; ii) further binding of glcnac units. however, binding through ser <dig> remains inconclusive, since the mutational results revealed that ser <dig> did not act as a powerful binding residue. alternatively, this binding step might be made through a different surface-exposed aromatic residue located nearby; and iii) sliding of bound sugar units of the chitin chain into the substrate binding cleft. based on the 'slide and bend' mechanism proposed by watanabe and others  <cit> , the sliding process is achieved by cooperative interactions with other surface-exposed aromatic residues located close to the entrance of the substrate binding cleft. however, our data strongly suggested that the chitin chain movement most likely takes place via an interaction with different surface-exposed aromatic residues other than tyr <dig> and trp <dig> 

when pnp- <dig> was used as a substrate, hydrolyzing activities of the mutated enzymes and the wild-type enzyme were almost indistinguishable. this observation and the essentially unchanged catalytic efficiency  of all mutants compared to wild-type enzyme clearly pointed out that ser <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig> and tyr <dig> do not play a major role in the process of hydrolysis of soluble chitooligosaccharides.

CONCLUSIONS
point mutations of four surface-exposed residues of v. carchariae chitinase a and subsequent experiments on chitin binding and hydrolysis were performed. trp <dig>  which is located at the n-terminal end of the chitin binding domain, was identified as the most crucial residue in colloidal and crystalline chitin binding and consequently their hydrolysis. the residues trp <dig> and tyr <dig>  both located nearer to the substrate-binding cleft, influenced chitin hydrolysis but not really insoluble chitin binding.
