BACKGROUND
ion mobility spectrometry  has gained significant attentions over the past few decades for rapid, high-resolution separations power, which can separate ions on a millisecond time-scale  <cit> . as a separation technique which based on differences in size and shape of analytes, ims has proven powerful in the fields of metabolomics, glycomics and proteomics  <cit> . ion mobililty-mass spectrometry , an analytical technique by which ims coupled with mass spectrometry , have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing biological mixtures, especially for current proteomics studies  <cit> . by combination of the advantages of ims and ms, imms opens up avenues for the detailed structural analysis of large and heterogeneous protein complexes, providing information on the stoichiometry, topology and cross section of their composition  <cit> .

a typical proteomics experimental setup using imms consists of five components: sample introduction, compound ionization, ion mobility separation, mass separation as well as peptide and protein ion detection  <cit> . although these five components all play essential roles in the process, ion mobility separation is crucial for its impact on the consequent mass analysis and peptide ion detection  <cit> . ion mobility separation, by which the peptide ions with different cross-sections and molecular charges will be separated, adds a new dimension of separation and makes imms an attractive method for analyzing complex proteomics samples. peptide ion separation can be enhanced by changing different gases, altering electric field strengths, and adopting non-linear electric field gradients, by which peptide identification can be facilitated to achieve high confidence  <cit> . even though these efforts improve the separation capability of imms, they are still time-consuming, and it is difficult to reproduce under different experimental conditions.

although imms separates peptide ions based on differing cross-sections and molecular charge, the experimental measurement behaves in the way that peptides spend different time through the drift tube. it has been reported that the measurement of peptide ion drift time using imms is very reproducible  <cit> . any two measurements of mobilities  recorded on the same instrument usually agree to within 1% relative uncertainty. measurements performed by different groups usually agree to within 2%. as a characteristic of different ions, peptide ion drift time can be used to enhance confidence in protein identifications.

there are several efforts which attempt to computationally determine the mobile behaviour of peptide ions in ims. valentine et al. predict peptide ion cross sections using intrinsic size parameters  and tested it on  <dig> singly-charged peptides  <cit> . a quantitative structure-property relationship  based approach was proposed for prediction of peptide drift time by liu et al. and found the structure effect and the charge states of peptide ion contribute a lot to the drift time  <cit> . shah et al. employed partial least squares  and support vector regression  based approaches to predict the drift time of massive peptide ions with different charge states and demonstrated both techniques significantly outperform the isps based calculation by a test on a high confidence database of  <dig>  peptide sequences  <cit> . zhang et al. presented a quantitative structure-spectrum relationship  study to predict peptide drift time and found the sequence-based approach can get better fitting ability and predictive power but worse interpretability than the structure-based approach  <cit> . our previous works also attempted to address the same problem by employing artificial neural networks and multiply linear regression models  <cit> . although these studies contributed the drift time prediction of peptide ions a lot, isp based calculations did not show the high performance in peptides with high charged states, and structure-based methods have to construct and optimize the geometrical structures of peptides which will bring inevitable errors into prediction models.

in this paper, a least square-support vectors regression  model is presented to predict peptide ion drift time in imms just from the sequence-based features of peptide. the sequence pattern of each peptide was represented as a 36-component vector, which was consisted of for descriptors, i.e., molecular weight, sequence length, amino acid composition and pseudo amino acid composition. in construction of the ls-svr regression, a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was employed to determine the optimized values of the regression parameters. our proposed ls-svr method was applied into three peptide ions datasets with different charge states, i.e., + <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig> 

RESULTS
in this work, all the raw data generated from the imms were processed using masslynx v <dig> , an instrument control software, to obtain the drift time for each peptide ion peak. masslynx is a powerful software for analyzing and processing the data acquired from mass spectrometers which are developed waters corporation. the peptides generated from tryptic digestion of  <dig> pure proteins were used for our model development and testing in this study. peptide charge status was manually assigned based on the m/z spacing between isotopic peaks. as a result, the total of  <dig> peptides assigned ions which came from the  <dig> proteins became the dataset for this work. within this dataset,  <dig> peptides were singly charged,  <dig> were doubly and  <dig> were triply charged. more details can be found in our previous work  <cit> .

ims separate ions based on the fact ions with different shapes and charge states travel though the drift tube at different velocities. in the drift tube, the ions were pulled by a weak electric field and opposed by the inset buffer gas. the charge state is a very important factor for the drift time. therefore, we developed the svr models for singly-, doubly- and triply-charged peptides, respectively. in this work we denotes dataset of singly-charged peptides as datas, doubly-charged peptides as datad, and triply-charged as datat.

prediction performance evaluation
in this study, we developed the ls-svr models for predicting peptide drift time for the singly-, doubly-, and triply-charged peptides, respectively. a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was employed in the training and test process of the regression models, by which all observations in each datasets are used for both training and validation. this cross-validation can provide reliable learning of our model from the original data.

the purpose of this work is to predict ion drift time of peptides by elucidating the relationship between the dependent variable, i.e., peptide drift time, and the sequence-based peptide features we used, i.e., peptide molecular weight, sequence length, aac and pseaac. for regression analysis, there are many criteria by which they can be evaluated and compared. the root mean square error  and coefficient of determination  are selected in this work to evaluate the predictive performance of our ls-svr models.

  rmse=∑i=1n2n 

  r2=1-∑i=1n2∑i=1n <dig> 

where n is the number of peptide in the dataset, dt is the experimentally observed peptide ion drift time, dt the predicted drift time by ls-svr models, dt¯ is the overall average value of peptide drift time. r <dig> takes any value between  <dig> and  <dig>  with a value closer to  <dig> indicating the regression model is of better performance.

furthermore, in order to assess the prediction accuracy of ls-svr models, a prediction variation threshold, ηt, was defined by the relative variation of the predicted drift time from the experimentally observed values. if the relative variation between observed and predicted drift time is smaller than ηt, the prediction will be seen as reliable, otherwise, unreliable.

  η=|dt-dt′|dt 

where η is the prediction variation, dt' is the predicted peptide ion drift time and dt is the experimentally observed peptide ion drift time.

parameters selection
as what state in methods part, ls-svr models with gaussian kernel was adopted to predict peptides drift time. there are two important parameters for this kind of regression model, i.e., the width of gaussian kernel parameter σ, and the regularization factor γ. the correct setting of these two parameters of the ls-svr models is of critical importance in enabling us to achieve good regression performances. in this work, the grid-searching scheme is used to determine these two parameters based on cross validation strategy. specifically, the σ <dig> and γ were tuned simultaneously in a grid ranging from 2- <dig>  2- <dig>  ...,  <dig> for σ <dig> and from 2- <dig>  2- <dig>  ...,  <dig> for γ. the prediction accuracy of ls-svr models for each peptide dataset was seen as the objective function to determine the optimum combination of σ <dig> and γ, where the value of ηt was set as  <dig> .

the accuracy curves for different combination of the σ <dig> and γ in the three peptide datasets were shown in the figure  <dig>  it can be seen that the regression performance of ls-svr models are heavily depend on the selection of the parameters σ <dig> and γ. when γ is fixed, the prediction accuracy goes up with the increase of σ <dig> to an apex and then goes down. for datas, the top  <dig> prediction accuracy values correspond to the combinations  of  <cit> , , , , and  <cit> . the top  <dig> ls-svr models for datad have the combination parameters of  <cit> ,  <cit> , , , and  <cit> . for the peptide dataset with triply-charge, datat, the top  <dig> combinations are  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> , and  <cit> . overall the three datasets, the value  <cit>  can achieve the best prediction accuracy for the ls-svr models when ηt =  <dig> . therefore, the σ <dig> of  <dig> and γ of  <dig> were selected for the subsequent analysis in this work.

prediction performance
a 10-fold cross validation was implemented in the construction of ls-svr models, by which the different separation of the original dataset will bring the changes of predicted drift time for each peptide. for evaluating the uncertainty in the regression performance of our model which come from the randomness of the dataset separations, the regression procedure was repeated for ten times. the mean of the prediction drift times for each peptide from these ten times experiments were taken as the finally predicted value. also the variation of the ten times was studied to exam the stability of our proposed ls-svr models.

the prediction performance was shown in table  <dig>  it can be seen that our models ca achieved very good prediction ability for different peptide dataset, i.e.,  <dig>  for datas,  <dig>  for datad, and  <dig>  for datat. comparing to datas and datad, the prediction accuracy of the triply-charge peptide ions in datat is a little bit poor. one reason for this situation is that the dataset's size is small, i.e.,  <dig> peptide in datat, which can not provide sufficient information in the model training. another reason, we believe, is that the charge state of datat is higher than that of datas and datad, which usually cause the peptide longer. the mean length of peptides in datat is  <dig> , which is  <dig>  times of that in datad, and  <dig>  times in datas. the longer of the peptide length is, the more chance the peptide form the secondary structure will be. obviously, the changes in space conformation will contribute the peptide's velocity in drift cell and therefore, affect the peptide ion's drift time.

a. the prediction accuracy for each dataset was shown as the format of a, where a denotes the prediction accuracy from the mean of predicted drift times, b the mean prediction accuracy of the ten repeat times, and c the standard deviation of the accuracy of the ten repeat times.

it can be found from table  <dig> that the prediction accuracy from the mean of the predicted drift times is better than the mean accuracy of the ten repeat experiments. it can get  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for datas, datad, and datat, respectively, which indicated that the combination regression model will improve the predictive power of predictors. from table  <dig>  it can also be seen that the standard deviation of the prediction accuracy of the ten repeat experiments is very small, i.e.,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the three datasets. it demonstrate our ls-svr models are stable and statistically valid because a small change in the data, such as the different split of the training and test dataset, may lead to large changes of the prediction performance.

the relative small rmse and r <dig> shown in table  <dig> also indicted the powerful regression performance of ls-svr models in prediction of peptide ion's drift times in imms. we got very small rmse values for datad and datat, and a little higher value,  <dig> , for datas, which is reasonable for the big range of the original drift time, from  <dig>  s to  <dig>  s. the r <dig> values of around  <dig>  for datas and datad,  <dig>  for datat are shown high correlation between the predicted and experimental observed peptide drift times. more details about the regression results can be found in figure  <dig>  where the line showed the linear fitting between the predicted and observed drift time in a least-squares sense. the high correlation coefficients, i.e.,  <dig>  for both datas and datad, and  <dig>  for datat, signifies the ls-svr model we proposed here can capture the general properties by which different peptides fly through drift cell in different velocities.

after the ls-svr models had finished the regression analysis for the three datasets with different charge states ions, the variation threshold ηt will decide which peptide can be predicted correctly. figure  <dig> displays the relation between the fraction of peptide ions whose drift time are predicted correctly and the accuracy threshold ηt. it can be seen that our proposed method can get best prediction performance in the datas. the reason we believe is the peptides in datas are small and have higher probability they adopt elongated conformations in order to minimize coulomb repulsion, while the peptides in datat usually are large and have higher probability to form secondary structure when they go through the drift cell in imms instrument. it can be found even the variation threshold is set as  <dig> , there are more than 90% peptides can be predicted correctly, by which the prediction performance of our ls-svr model can be demonstrated. if the conformation information can be added into the regression model, the predictive power for doubly- and triply-charge peptides will be increased undoubtedly.

CONCLUSIONS
to enhance the confidence of peptide identification, a ls-svr model was developed in this study to predict peptide ion drift time for imms measurements. in ls-svr, there are two parameters, i.e., the width of gaussian kernel parameter σ, and the regularization factor γ, have to be selected for their influence on the regression accuracy. a grid searching strategy was employed to optimize the selection of these two parameters. based on the peptide sequence, a 34-component vector was extracted as representation to construct our ls-svr models on three peptide ion datasets with different charge states. with the prediction accuracy threshold η was set to  <dig> , we achieved very high performance, i.e.,  <dig>  and  <dig> , for the peptide ions with singly- and doubly-charge, which indicated the prediction capability of the ls-svr models. it is reasonable that there is a relative lower prediction accuracy of  <dig>  for datat, for the peptides with higher charge states have a higher probability that they can form a secondary structure. this kind of situation will be improved if the structure information can be added into our proposed ls-svr models; even more computational cost will be requested.
