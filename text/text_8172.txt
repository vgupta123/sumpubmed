BACKGROUND
regulation of transcription initiation is controlled by several distinct processes, including binding of transcription factors to distal and proximal binding sites and the accessibility of dna  <cit> . the accessibility of dna is influenced by chromatin features, including chemical modifications of histones. modifications of histones and their effect on transcription initiation are the most well-understood chromatin features: acetylation generally is correlated with accessible chromatin, while lysine methylation can have both activating and repressive roles  <cit> . histone modifications, as well as other chromatin features, are often referred to as epigenetic marks. we will avoid this term as we are not assessing hereditary changes in chromatin but transient differences in chromatin states between promoters in this study, and instead refer to these as chromatin marks or just histone modifications.

early studies raised the hope of deriving a "histone code" <cit>  which based on the occurrence of respective modifications could explain the rate of accessibility, and even predict the locations of different genomic features such as promoters, enhancers, etc. it is only recently that we have had data sets of the size and quality to test whether chromatin marks or dna signals are in themselves sufficient to predict the location of promoters and enhancers , and which marks that are the most predictive. indeed, several studies have shown that given sufficient histone modification data, it is possible to predict the location of active promoters and enhancers  <cit> . two recent studies have also shown that the mrna transcription levels of genes can be predicted by chromatin information around the start site  <cit> .

the mrna level of a gene is essentially a function of its rate of rnapii elongation and its degradation, but is not necessarily correlated with the rate of recruitment of rnapii in the core promoter: recent studies  <cit>  have demonstrated widespread rnapii pausing near the tss in mammals and insects. this has regulatory importance since a subset of genes in the studied cell types only have poised, but not elongating rnapii  <cit> . the importance of the poising and/or release of rnapii make it necessary to distinguish recruitment and elongation of rnapii from each other and to make separate predictive models for each. thus, activation of core promoters can indicate the recruitment, release/elongation of rnapii, or the production of stable mrna, depending on context.

therefore, in this study, we extend previous computational efforts by exploring the predictability of rnapii recruitment, elongation and the release of stalled rnapii from chromatin signals in the regions around the tss, taking both the strength of signals and their spatial distribution into account.

we show that rnapii recruitment, elongation and stalling can be predicted from the chromatin features in the promoter region, and that the positional distribution of marks in the promoter is almost as predictive as the signal intensities of the same marks. interestingly, when predicting rnapii stalling/release, binding sites of transcription factors reported to have a key role in this process have less predictive importance than the chromatin signals. we further demonstrate that the significant and joint enrichment of h3k9ac, h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> is necessary for rnapii enrichment in the promoter but not sufficient for elongation.

RESULTS
a framework for predicting location and usage rate of core promoters
to predict promoter usage from chromatin signals, we constructed a computational framework. we wanted this framework to be able to incorporate any type of signal distributed around the tss, and take both the signal strength as well as the spatial distribution of the signal into account. therefore, the - <dig> to + <dig> region around human tsss were divided into  <dig> sub-regions, each  <dig> nucleotides  wide, designated "bins", where the center bin was centered on an annotated tss. while the bin size was originally chosen to mimic the span of dna wrapped around a nucleosome, our results are robust to changing the number of bins and their position, as described below and in methods.

in each such bin, we counted the contribution from each type of signal by summing the aligned tags from a given chip-seq experiment falling into the region; this formed the primary input to the predictive model . all data used were from the encode dataset and k <dig> cell line, unless otherwise mentioned . for assessing the recruitment and/or stalling of rnapii we adopted an approach similar to muse et al.  <cit> , counting the number of rnapii chip-seq tags in the promoter region  since this span will entirely cover the most proximal histones upstream and downstream of the tss; for measuring elongation we counted the number of tags from chiped rnapii in the downstream gene body region ) .

we estimated mrna levels using rna-seq tags mapping to the first  <dig>   <dig> nt exonic sequence downstream of the tss, excluding the intronic intervals. this definition was a compromise between the following two factors: i) as rna-seq reads are randomly sheared and therefore have problems capturing edges of exons and transcripts, we needed a reasonably large rna space to measure expression and ii) for very long genes, we wanted to avoid counting contributions from possible alternative promoters, or alternative splice forms. the effects of changing the thresholds are described in methods.

given this data, we used a random forest  <cit>  method for pairwise classification of active vs. silent promoters vs. randomly selected non-promoter regions. given that a promoter was active we also predicted its usage rate . we defined active promoters  as annotated promoters detected by both encode cage and rna-seq data , while we defined silent promoters  as the set where neither of the methods detected the promoter.

predictive accuracy and feature importance
this framework accurately classified active/inactive promoters in terms of mrna production with an area under curve  <cit>  score of  <dig> . it attained significantly less precise classifications of inactive promoters vs. random genomic locations  . these accuracies are similar to previous results  <cit> . the framework is also capable of predicting promoter usage  in a regression model. promoter usage can be measured in different ways - recruitment of rnapii, elongating rnapii, or by the concentration mature mrnas. for recruitment and elongation of rnapii, we predicted the density of rnapii chip tags in the regions around the tss and in the gene body, respectively, and achieved mean pearson correlation coefficients  of ~ <dig>  for rnapii around the tss and ~ <dig>  for rnapii in the gene body by only considering the histone modification patterns. similarly, we could predict mrna expression based on rna-seq tags with a mean pcc of ~ <dig>  .

the mrna regression results are similar to those of previous studies  <cit> , which used microarrays or rna-seq, but an important difference is that we, in contrast to previous studies, removed transcriptionally silent genes before the analysis. this is important since many genes are transcriptionally silent, and therefore the training sets will be unbalanced unless these are removed.

we wanted to see if our results were dependent on our specific methods and thresholds. first, we applied linear regression models  to compare the results with the random forest method. although the correlation scores obtained using random forest were consistently  better than the ones obtained with standard linear regression, in absolute terms the mean pcc difference was small . this indicates that the framework is robust and that different types of machine learning models can be successfully applied to it. we also explored the effects of changing the definitions of promoter and gene body regions for both rnapii and rna-seq data , and found that while the definitions can influence the pcc values, the absolute differences are not large, ~ <dig> - <dig>  for rnpii measurements and ~ <dig> - <dig>  for rna-seq.

an advantage of the random forest method in comparison with artificial neural networks  <cit>  or support vector machines  <cit>  is that the importance of each input feature for the final prediction can be easily assessed, which can give insights into the mechanisms underlying the input data. as expected, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k9ac signals have the largest importance on classification of inactive vs. active promoters, especially h3k4me <dig> . the most informative signals are located immediately around the tss. this is consistent with previous studies establishing that h3k <dig> di- and tri-methylation are indicative of active promoters  <cit> .

when predicting the promoter usage level we observe roughly the same marks being important as in the active versus inactive classification , with a few interesting differences. firstly, the importance of h3k27ac and h3k9ac for the prediction of promoter usage level is substantially increased compared with h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  this fits well with the hypothesis that the acetylation marks are indicative of the scaling of promoter usage while the h3k4me <dig> and  <dig> marks function more as platforms to establish the promoter  <cit> .

secondly, when predicting rnapii density within the gene body or mrna production by rna-seq, the chromatin signals are generally more informative downstream of the tss. in contrast, signals located upstream and downstream of the tss are important for the prediction of the rnapii density in the promoter.

to investigate this further, for each promoter, we normalized the contribution of each input feature si, j, where i is the chip experiment and j indicates the bin:

  norm=si,j∑j’ =  <dig> .13si,j’ 

this normalization will retain the shape of the distribution of each modification in a single promoter but not the overall magnitude of signals. we then plotted the normalized distribution of h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k27ac for the promoters broken up by their level of mrna expression . from these plots, we can see there is little variance between the different expression classes in very immediate regions around the tss but a high variance between h3k4me <dig> and me <dig> in the + <dig> to + <dig>   <dig> nt region, corresponding to the third to sixth nucleosome downstream of the tss. however, this is not true for the two acetylation marks . these observations indicate that not only the signal strength of the marks but also some parts of their positional distributions are informative. this observation encouraged us to investigate how much predictive power there is in the positional distributions as described below.

the distribution of histone modifications is both predictive for defining the promoter and for determining expression level
several studies have shown that several histone marks have characteristic patterns around promoters - for instance, h3k4me <dig> and me <dig> marks tend to have a double peak around active tsss and flanking the nucleosome-depleted region at active tsss  <cit> . since the model we have takes both the signal position and strength  into account, we wanted to see if the positional distribution in itself had predictive power disregarding the signal strength. therefore, we normalized the contribution of each feature within each promoter as described in equation  <dig> 

using the normalized data, we tried to distinguish active and inactive promoters from each other and predict the usage rate of the active ones. classification using only the distribution shape gives an auc value of  <dig> , compared to  <dig>   when also using the signal strength information, showing that the shape of the distribution alone is highly indicative of promoter activation.

regression using only the positional distribution gave a pcc for rna-seq of  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  when also using the signal strength. for rnapii in the promoter, the corresponding values are  <dig>  and  <dig>  and for rnapii in the gene body rnapii  <dig>  and  <dig> .

while the regression results using signal strength were always significantly better than using only the normalized shape as input , it is clear that the distribution shape of histone marks has substantial predictive power.

increasing the number of bins in general only gave minor improvements . a caveat with this analysis is that the shape and the signal strengths are not strictly independent, as more complex distributions require higher number of chip tags mapping into the region.

incorporating additional features
we tried to improve the regression performance by also incorporating more elaborate models and additional data. the random forest method takes pairwise interactions between features into account, while the linear method does not. to see if this could explain the lower accuracy of the linear method we included all possible pairwise interactions in the linear model. this did not improve the performance of the linear regression model substantially , indicating that an assumption of independence of the marks is a reasonable simplification for modeling promoter usage by histone marks.

encouraged by the fact that high and low cpg content promoters are subject to different histone modifications and methylation patterns, we included extra features such as dinucleotide content, gc content, normalized cg dinucleotide fraction  <cit>  and dna methylation status to the analysis, but these features only improved the predictability slightly , and the difference compared to the original analysis is not statistically significant. this suggests that the chromatin signals indirectly incorporate this information, although the causality is unclear.

exploring the necessity of histone marks for recruiting rnapii
while the feature importance from the random forest can give important hints on the biological properties of the system, it cannot be directly translated to ascertain whether a particular mark is necessary since the redundancy of marks is not considered. since we identified h3k9ac, h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> to be the most important features for predicting the amount of rnapii at the promoter, we proceeded to analyze if there is a strict requirement to have these signals present or if some of the marks are optional but their presence contribute to the overall rnapii recruitment or elongation.

to do this, we needed a threshold defining whether a certain mark is enriched or not. we used a threshold based on the 95th quantile of the signal strength distribution from randomly chosen genomic regions for respective marks, and also for the enrichment of rnapii respectively in the promoter and in the gene body .

we next investigated the impact of co-occurrence of h3k9ac, h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> for rnapii occupancy, measured by rnapii density in either the core promoter or in the gene body. we subdivided the set of  <dig>   <dig> non-overlapping transcripts  depending on whether they have none, some, or all of the above marks present. this analysis showed that most promoters either have none or all the marks enriched, which fits with the finding that h3k4me <dig> and ach <dig> marks are prone to be more stable when they occur together  <cit> . moreover, 90% of the promoter regions are lacking rnapii signal unless all marks are present; conversely, if all marks are present, 89% of the promoters regions have significantly enriched rnapii signal . this pattern is not present when assessing promoter usage by the density of rnapii in the gene body, where only 36% of the core promoters with all marks contain rnapii in the gene body . this is consistent with some promoters only having recruited, but not elongating, rnapii . varying the thresholds to the 90th or 99th quantile, or using a poisson-based test with p <  <dig>  or p < 10- <dig> significance thresholds as used in ernst et al. <cit>  did not change this trend .

since the k <dig> cell line is known to have specific chromosomal aberrations  <cit> , we wanted to ensure that these properties observed were general. therefore, we redid the analysis for the set of all promoter regions using chip data from two other cell lines, nhek and huvec from the encode set, which gave consistent results .

this implies that all of the four marks are necessary in the recruitment of rnapii at the tss but not sufficient for elongation. a necessary caveat is that this causality  cannot be proved rigorously since i) these results could be explained by a third confounding variable that always co-occurs with the four marks, ii) we are not measuring a single cell and we do not know if the marks physically co-occur on the same nucleosome and iii) we do not know if the histone modifications are needed to recruit rnapii or vice versa.

we hypothesized that some of these modifications occur simultaneously. this fits with a recent study where pasini et al.  <cit>  showed that recruitment of ezh <dig> to the promoter leads to tri-methylation of h3k <dig> and prevents h <dig> acetylation in polycomb group target genes, especially h3k27ac but also h3k9ac, forming a methylation-acetylation switch. this model would predict that h3k27me <dig> would be negatively correlated with h3k27ac and h3k9ac; our data supports this  < - <dig> ); in fact, since the four marks under consideration are highly correlated , all are negatively correlated with h3k27me <dig> .

predicting stalling and release of rna polymerase ii
several recent studies have shown that a substantial set of promoters recruits rnapii, which is not released for elongation  <cit> . this is important since it indicates that the recruitment of rnapii might not always be the rate-limiting step of mrna transcription. thus, it is worthwhile to investigate the associations between the modification status of histones and the rnapii stalling characteristics.

a possible solution is to correlate the elongation rate of rnapii with the amount of downstream marks that are found in the transcribed regions, such as di- and tri-methylation of h3k <dig> and h3k79me <dig> shown by earlier studies  <cit> . however, these marks are likely deposited as a consequence of elongation, and it is less likely that the initiation complex is directly influenced by the histone marks in the gene body. therefore, we wanted to investigate if the stalling features of rnapii could be predicted by chromatin signals around the tss.

the amount of stalling vs. elongation has typically been measured by taking the ratio between the density of rnapii at the core promoters vs. in the gene body - called either the travelling ratio or the stalling index <cit> . here, we used the s index as defined in muse et al.  <cit> :

  s=log2)-log2) 

where d is the number of rnapii chiped tags per nt in the given region. this will give a value between ~- <dig> and ~ <dig> . we defined the promoter region as +- <dig> region around the tss since the span will entirely cover the most proximal histones upstream and downstream, and defined the gene body to be the remaining part of the gene.

we then tried to predict the s index of the  <dig>   <dig> genes  by using the  <dig> bin framework as above, and compared predicted and actual s index values. we achieved a mean pcc of  <dig> , similar to our previous regression results. addition of dinucleotide densities as additional features only resulted in a slight improvement .

we reasoned that while the epigenetics data clearly has substantial predictive power by itself, including additional features might increase this value even further. several transcription factors are known to be correlated with polymerase elongation, including the negative elongation factor nelf that pauses the elongation of rnapii  <cit> , and the transcription factor cmyc  <cit> , that has a role in regulating the release of paused rnapii. thus, we also tried to include chip data for nelfe, an important subunit of nelf for the inhibitory function, and cmyc in our models to improve the prediction power.

surprisingly, the prediction based on only cmyc and nelfe alone gave a lower pcc of  <dig> . the lower amount of information in the transcription factor binding sites vs chromatin signals could be due to several reasons. firstly, a recent study has shown that release-associated factors such as cmyc can be found in both stalled and elongating promoters  <cit> . secondly, their interaction with the pre-initiation complex might not require strong binding to dna; if so, the factors would not be detected as clear chip peaks in the proximal promoter. notably, using these two factors as additional features together with the chromatin data only improved the regression results slightly . we hypothesize that the predictive power of these factors are to a large degree already contained in the histone mark data. similarly, sequence patterns such as dinucleotide content, including cpg, or the presence of tata-boxes had limited predictive power .

the most informative epigenetic features for the regression are still h3k27ac, h3k9ac, h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> with a clear preference for the first bin after the tss , suggesting that modifications within the + <dig> nucleosome are directly or indirectly associated with the stalling/release decision. indeed, if we plot the normalized mean chip density of different promoters divided by the s index , we observe that the highest difference between the classes is just downstream of the tss, and not further downstream as observed when predicting the elongation rate .

since the same marks are indicated to be important in the stalling prediction as in the elongation prediction, we wanted to see whether we predict the s index as a by-effect of predicting the elongation. therefore, we split the testing promoters by expression level into five classes by rna-seq and predicted the s index for each subset by using the original model . this gave pcc range between  <dig> - <dig> . the low variance between the results from the expression subsets suggests that the results are not simply an effect of predicting the mrna level, consistent with the differences in feature importance between the two predictions discussed above.

to ensure our framework is general and not over-fitted to the k <dig> cell line, we applied the same model  to predict the s index of rnapii data in the huvec cell line within the encode set. by using the corresponding chip data as the model input, we reached a pcc of  <dig>   which is slightly lower than that of the originating cell line. this is likely due to normalization issues since the total counts of chromosomal signal enrichment as well as the sequencing depths are different between the experiments.

discussion
a few recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic data is predictive of the production of mrnas as measured by microarray and rna-seq  <cit> . in this study, we have expanded this into predicting rnapii recruitment, elongation and stalling, as well as assessing the impact of the distribution of signals vs the signal strength.

predictive methods are even more usable if they are not "black boxes" and can identify what biological features are the most important for accurate predictions. previous computational methods identified different sets of histone marks to be the most predictive of mrna production; karlic et al. found h3k4me <dig> and h3k79me <dig> to be most informative in predicting the expression level in low cpg content promoters whereas the expression in high cpg ones depend more on h3k27ac and h4k20me <dig>  <cit> . in another study by cheng et al., h3k4me <dig> and h3k <dig> sets are reported to be more predictive than rnapii in predicting the gene expression  <cit> . this difference could in part be due to the set of marks used as input in both studies not being identical, but could also be due to a redundancy in the chromatin signals around promoters. while the redundancy makes predictions easier, it makes the interpretation of the predictive features harder in terms of causality.

in our study, we have broken up rnapii recruitment and elongation and found that the most predictive marks for both the processes are h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k27ac, but the location of the marks have different predictive importance for respective processes. in fact, the positional distributions of marks are almost as informative in the prediction as the signal strength . in agreement with a previous experimental study  <cit> , the methylation marks are more predictive of identifying promoters  while the acetylation marks become more important when predicting the amount of rnapii recruitment and elongation. there are also differences in spatial information in these two processes: the downstream variances of both methylation and acetylation marks are more important than those upstream and around tss for the rnapii elongation and mrna prediction, while the opposite is true for predicting rnapii recruitment.

however, a follow-up analysis showed that almost all promoters with high amounts of recruited rnapii have all these marks simultaneously enriched. this fits well with previous studies based on individual correlations - for instance, kim et al found that 90% of all promoters having a rna polymerase ii pre-initiation complex  also contain acetylation of h <dig> and/or h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . consistently, wang et al found a modification backbone of  <dig> modifications that co-localize in ~25% of human promoters and only a very few promoters have a subset of these modifications  <cit> . all our  <dig> modifications are part of this backbone. however, it is important to point out that the prevalence of a signal and its importance in prediction of rnapii recruitment or elongation is not necessarily the same: if a signal occurs at all promoters regardless of its level of rna recruitment, it will have little predictive importance.

while our study showed that all of the four marks have to be present for rnapii recruitment in three different cell lines, the causality or order of recruitment is not clear. the study by wang et al showed that h3k <dig> methylation is needed for acetylation of h3k <dig> and that both marks are required for the recruitment of rnapii, but not sufficient for the elongation  <cit> . however, one could also envision a process where the rnapii or the pic will recruit enzymes responsible for the modification of the histones, as suggested in  <cit> .

in addition, among these four marks, h3k4me2/ <dig> have been reported to be respectively present in 97% and ~ 75% of all promoters in human cells, but only ~ 50% of these promoters produce detectable transcripts  <cit> , indicating that they by themselves are not predictive of elongation of rnapii. in this study, we have shown that the ratio between stalled and elongating rnapii can be predicted from chromatin signals around the tss . consistent with the above, the acetylation signals, in particular h3k27ac, are the most informative for predicting the stalling index.

it is surprising that adding chip data for the transcription factors cmyc and nelf, known to be involved in the release of stalled rnapii, does not give a substantial improvement in the prediction; in fact, if only using the chip data from the transcription factors in the proximal region, the prediction results are much lower, suggesting the detected binding sites of these two factors are not very informative. one possible reason for this is that the histone marks or other chromatin signals capture the effect of these factors. alternatively, the interaction between these transcription factors and rnapii might not be detected by the chip experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
the field of genomics is now in a situation where large data sets can be produced with small effort and cost compared to previously, meaning that the challenge has shifted towards analyzing and understanding the data produced. for this, we need frameworks that are both flexible, easily used and that can systematically mine the data to produce viable hypotheses to understand the underlying biology. in this study we have shown the feasibility of predicting rnapii stalling, transcription and mrna production at the core promoter level using a relatively simple machine learning framework which can also suggest new biological mechanisms, or reinforce previous hypotheses in a more statistically rigorous way.

we have found that the spatial distribution of marks is almost as predictive as their signal, and that different parts of the promoter are informative for prediction of the recruitment, elongating and release of rnapii. moreover, we find that the four marks, h3k <dig> di- and tri- methylation, h3k9ac and h3k27ac are nearly always co-occurring in promoters where rnapii is recruited. among these marks, h3k <dig> di- and tri- methylation are more informative for determining the promoter position whereas acetylation marks are more predictive of the amount of promoter usage.
