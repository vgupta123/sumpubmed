BACKGROUND
the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription  pathway can be activated by a wide range of cytokines. the binding of cytokines to their receptors drives receptor dimerization and phosphorylation, which leads to the recruitment, activation and dimerization of stats  <cit> . stat homodimers are translocated to the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of target genes  <cit> . ifn-gamma was first identified in a mitogen–activated lymphocyte supernatant based on its distinctive antiviral activity. it is widely involved in protection against tumour development and cancer immunoediting  <cit> . ifn-gamma triggers the prolonged activation of the transcription factor stat <dig> via the ifn-gamma receptor  and jak, which induces target gene expression by binding to the gamma-activated sequences  in the promoters of these genes  <cit> . thus, the activation of the ifn-gamma/jak/stat <dig> pathway can prevent the expansion of many different normal and neoplastic cells  <cit> . however, il- <dig> also has important roles in triggering the acute phase response of the body to injury or inflammation  <cit> . the receptor involved with the recognition of il- <dig> can be subdivided into the non-signalling part, i.e., glycoprotein  <dig> , and the signalling part, i.e., glycoprotein  <dig> . il- <dig> attaches to gp <dig> and drives il6-gp <dig> complex binding to the gp130-jak complex, which forms the il6-gp80-gp130-jak complex. gp <dig> associates with jak and it is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to il- <dig> stimulation, which leads to the activation of the jak/stat <dig> pathway and mapk  cascades  <cit> . il- <dig> activates target genes involved with differentiation, survival, apoptosis and proliferation, and it plays important roles in pro- and anti-inflammatory functions, acute phase and immune responses in the organism, and tumour progression  <cit> . three types of negative regulators are involved in the regulation of the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways: the suppressor of cytokine signalling , sh <dig> domain-containing tyrosine phosphates  <dig>  and various cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine phosphates   <cit> . socs <dig> and socs <dig> are induced by jak/stat pathway and they bind to the activated receptors of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  respectively, which negatively regulate the signal transduction of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  <cit> . shp- <dig> acts as a phosphatase in activated receptor complexes of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> and it negatively regulates the activation of stats  <cit> . pp <dig> dephosphorylates stat*s  in the cytoplasm, while pp <dig> dephosphorylates stat*s in the nucleus, which results in stats being returned to the cytosol, thereby influence the activation of stats  <cit> .

previous studies have indicated that ifn-gamma and il- <dig> have opposing roles in cell proliferation, apoptotic death and inflammation, which are closely related to the specific patterns and duration of stat activation after their stimulation  <cit> . ifn-gamma mainly phosphorylates stat <dig>  which has many pro-inflammatory effects  <cit> . by contrast, il- <dig> is a potent activator of stat <dig>  which contributes to its anti-inflammatory functions  <cit> . however, the detailed molecular mechanism leading to the unbalanced activation of stats after ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation remains unclear. qing et al. suggested that tyrosine  <dig> in the ifn-gamma receptor subunit  <dig> is required for the activation of both stat <dig> and stat <dig>  <cit> . in response to il- <dig>  stat <dig> binds to phosphorylated yxxq motifs  of gp <dig>  whereas stat <dig> is recruited to a more restricted consensus sequence pyxpq  in gp <dig>  <cit> . in addition, researchers have provided some interesting experimental results using stat-deficient cells. qing et al. showed that the activation of stat <dig> in response to ifn-gamma was much stronger and more prolonged in stat1-null cells than wild-type cells  <cit> . costa-pereira et al. showed that il- <dig> mediated an ifn-gamma-like response in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking stat <dig>  including the prolonged activation of stat <dig> and it promoted the induction of multiple ifn-gamma-inducible genes  <cit> . however, regis et al. reported that the activation of stat <dig> in human neoplastic t lymphocytes after ifn-gamma stimulation was generally unaffected by stat <dig> silencing  <cit> . ho et al. argued that stat <dig> did not affect the activation of stat <dig>  <cit> . bluyssen et al. reported that pre-treatment of ec with ifn-gamma significantly reduced the activation of stat <dig> after induction by il- <dig>  but without affecting the total amounts of stat <dig>  <cit> . however, kaur et al. reported that the activation of stat <dig> by ifn-gamma was mainly unaffected after pre-treatment with il- <dig> or other gp130-related cytokines in sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . these experimental results indicate that stat <dig> and stat <dig> may have common binding sites within ifn-gamma and il- <dig> receptors, while the activation of stat <dig> may depend on the concentration of stat <dig> and vice versa. moreover, the interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signals are not symmetric.

thyrell et al. also reported that ifn-alpha could influence the signal response of il- <dig> in multiple myeloma, which resulted in a decrease in stat <dig> homodimer dna-binding activity and a shift from stat <dig> homodimers to stat1/ <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . herrero et al. observed that pre-treatment with ifn-gamma could affect the signal response of il- <dig> in macrophages, which caused the il- <dig> mediated stat activation pattern to switch from stat <dig> homodimers to stat1/ <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . therefore, changes between stat homodimers and stat1/ <dig> heterodimers may represent a biologically relevant approach to determining the crosstalk between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways. however, how the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers regulates the interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signals is not fully understood.

systems biology modelling generally aims to find fairly plausible mechanistic models that include all of the relevant key processes in a biochemical system. it is considered to be a powerful analytical approach to understanding the essential mechanisms of the physiological functions of normal tissues and pathological progression during complex diseases  <cit> . the first systems biology model of the ifn-gamma/jak/stat <dig> pathway was developed by yamada et al.  <cit> . they modelled activation of the jak/stat <dig> pathway in response to ifn-gamma and analysed the effects of the feedback loop regulated by socs <dig>  later, zi et al. conducted a multi-parametric sensitivity analysis of the model produced by yamada et al. and indicated that the concentrations of socs <dig>  nuclear phosphatase pp <dig> and cytoplasmic stat <dig>  as well as some of the reaction steps that affected those concentrations, were the most sensitive to perturbation  <cit> . the first model of the il-6/jak/stat <dig> pathway was produced by singh et al.  <cit> . recently, moya et al. proposed an updated model of il- <dig> and il- <dig> signalling via jak/stat and erk-c/ebpβ activation  <cit> . the model was used to investigate dynamical features of the system such as the activity ratio of jak/stat and erk-c/ebpβ with different stimulation levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the dynamic behaviours of some individual molecules, such as stats and socss, in the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways were investigated in previous studies  <cit> , but signalling of the crosstalk during signal transduction by ifn-gamma and il- <dig> has still not been modelled.

in this study, we developed a crosstalk model of the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways by combining previously established mathematical models and by comprehensively analyzing the interactions between the two pathways. the model considered three possible levels of crosstalk between the two pathways:  the competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> for ifnr and gp130;  the mutual negative regulation between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> via the regulators socs <dig> and socs3; and  the restrictive effects of the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers on the activation of the transcription factors stat <dig> and stat <dig>  we considered a number of protocols where cells were stimulated by ifn-gamma and/or il- <dig>  the simulation results showed that the model provided a good explanation of the experimental observations and it provided new insights that could inform further research to facilitate a better understanding of the cross-regulation between the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways.

RESULTS
model description
based on the model of the ifn-gamma/jak/stat <dig> pathway produced by yamada et al.  <cit>  and the model of the il-6/10/jak/stat <dig> pathway produced by moya et al.  <cit> , we established a crosstalk model of the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> pathways. a schematic diagram of the model is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  in this model, the components of the two previous mathematical models, their structures and most of the parameters were left unchanged. for simplicity, we specified that shp- <dig> could repress the activated receptors of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  while pp <dig> and pp <dig>  could dephosphorylate stat <dig> and stat <dig> in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. we removed any reactions and components that were not connected with ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling, such as il- <dig>  sixteen new reactions were added based on the possible mechanisms of cross-regulation between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> 

the structure of the stat <dig> and stat <dig> proteins contains an oligomerization domain, a coiled-coil domain, a dna-binding domain, a linker domain, an sh <dig> domain and a transactivation domain  <cit> . the recruitment of stat <dig> and stat <dig> to the activated receptor complexes is known to be mediated by their sh <dig> domains and phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine motifs is required  <cit> . after receptor binding, the stats are phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue   <cit> . many experimental observations have shown that stat <dig> and stat <dig> may combine with the same docking sites in ifnr and gp <dig>  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that stat <dig> and stat <dig> might compete for the same phosphorylated docking sites in ifnr and gp <dig>  via their sh <dig> domains in our model. after stat <dig> and stat <dig> combine with the activated receptors complexes via ifn-gamma and/or il- <dig>  they are phosphorylated and disassociate from the receptors. based on these considerations, the new biochemical reactions  -  and  -   were added to our model to simulate the activation of stat <dig> after ifn-gamma stimulation and the activation of stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation, respectively.

the kinetic parameters of these new reactions are important because they reflect the properties of the biological system. wiederkehr-adam et al. indicated that the sh <dig> domain of stat <dig> had a much higher affinity for the phosphotyrosine  <dig> motif in ifngr <dig> than that in stat <dig>  <cit> . after il- <dig> stimulation, stat <dig> binds to the flexible pyxxq motifs in gp <dig>  whereas stat <dig> is recruited to the more restricted consensus sequence of pyxpq in gp <dig>  <cit> . based on these observations, we hypothesized the unbalanced competitive binding of stat <dig> and stat <dig> with ifnr and gp <dig> after ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation, respectively. additional file 1: tables s1-s <dig> show that the main effector of il- <dig> signalling, stat <dig>  had a higher affinity for gp <dig> than stat <dig>  similarly, the main effector of ifn-gamma signalling, stat <dig>  had a higher affinity for ifnr than stat <dig> 

shp- <dig> and socs combine to regulate signal transduction by ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  <cit> . socs <dig> inhibits the jak/stat pathway by binding to the activation loop of jak via its sh <dig> domain  <cit> . socs <dig> can also bind to jak  <cit> . socs <dig> and shp- <dig> combine with different sites in the receptor complexes of ifn-gamma  <cit> . however, socs <dig> and shp- <dig> may have similar binding specificities. experiments have suggested that socs <dig> and shp <dig> may compete for same site  in gp <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation  <cit> . in our model, socs <dig> and shp- <dig> were capable of binding to the receptor complex of ifn-gamma without mutual interference, whereas socs <dig> and shp- <dig> could competitively bind to the receptor complex. distinct genes belonging to the socs family are induced as immediate early genes  downstream of different stats and they can inhibit stat activation in a classical negative feedback loop  <cit> . it is generally recognized that socs <dig> has an important role in modulating ifn-gamma signalling  <cit> , whereas socs <dig> mainly affects il- <dig> signalling  <cit> . it is also well known that the stat <dig> and stat <dig> homodimers are direct transcription factors of the jak/stat pathway, which play important roles in signal transduction during ifn and gp <dig> receptor signalling  <cit> . however, bluyssen et al. reported that socs <dig> could also be induced after ifn-gamma stimulation in ec and that it could inhibit signal transduction by il- <dig>  <cit> . qing et al. observed that the stat <dig> and stat <dig> homodimers could both be induced after ifn-gamma stimulation in mefs, which both bound to the same gas element in the socs <dig> promoter  <cit> . the sequence of this gas element is conserved in mice, rats and humans  <cit> . it was shown that stat <dig> activation was much stronger and more prolonged in stat1-null cells, and that socs <dig> was strongly induced in wild-type and stat1-null cells, while the levels of socs <dig> mrna were greatly increased in stat3-null cells  <cit> . thus, it is speculated that stat <dig> homodimers might also promote the transcription of socs <dig> in the same way as stat <dig> homodimers. however, no experimental evidence indicates that stat <dig> homodimers can combine with the promoter region of socs <dig>  thus, our model does not regard stat <dig> homodimers as an efficient transcription factor for socs <dig>  we added equation  to our model to simulate the transcription of socs <dig> mrna after its induction by stat <dig> homodimers in the nucleus, which is represented as  <dig> 

thyrell et al. reported that ifn-alpha could affect the signal response of il- <dig> in multiple myeloma, which resulted in a decrease in stat <dig> homodimer dna-binding activity and a shift from stat <dig> homodimers to stat1/ <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . herrero et al. showed that pre-treatment with ifn-gamma could affect the signal response of il- <dig> in macrophages, causing the il-10-mediated activation pattern to switch from stat <dig> homodimers to stat1/ <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . these experimental results showed that stat1/ <dig> heterodimers play important roles in the crosstalk between different cytokines. the activation of stats after cytokine stimulation led to the formation of stat homo- and heterodimers  <cit> .

haan et al. reported that il- <dig> stimulation of primary human macrophages led to a different distribution of stat dimer species in the cytosol and nucleus. in particular, they showed that stat1/ <dig> heterodimers were present in the cytosol and nucleus  <cit> . the size of stats exceeds  <dig> kda, which is far beyond the exclusion limit of the nuclear pores, so stats need to be translocated actively into the nucleus  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessarily required for stat nuclear translocation  <cit> . basic residues  are known to contribute to the nuclear localization signals  of dimeric stat <dig>  <cit> . pp <dig> dephosphorylates stat*s in the cytoplasm, while pp <dig> dephosphorylates stat*s in the nucleus, which leads to stats being returned to the cytosol  <cit> . it was postulated that the nuclear export signals  in the dna-binding domain of stat <dig> is comprised of the residues 399– <dig>  <cit> . the formation and dephosphorylation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> homodimers in the cytosol and nucleus were modelled by yamada et al. and moya et al., respectively. their models also described the translocation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> homodimers from the cytosol to the nucleus, and the export of dephosphorylated stat monomer from the nucleus to the cytoplasm  <cit> . in our model, biochemical reactions  -  were added to simulate the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers in the cytoplasm and nuclei. for simplicity, it was supposed that only stat1* and stat3* could form stat1/ <dig> heterodimers. biochemical reaction  was added to simulate the stat1/ <dig> heterodimer translocation process from the cytoplasm to the nucleus based on the translocation of stat homodimers. it was also assumed that stat1/ <dig> heterodimers could be dephosphorylated by pp <dig> and pp <dig>  which resulted in stat export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. biochemical reactions - were added to simulate this process. the specific biological role of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers remains obscure  <cit> , so we did not regard the stat1/ <dig> heterodimers as efficient transcription factors in our model.

to construct the crosstalk model, we merged the common components from previous models, such as shp- <dig>  pp <dig> and pp <dig>  jak <dig> and jak <dig> are two species in the jak family, which play important roles in the signal responses of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  <cit> . in previous studies, jak <dig> and jak <dig> were treated as jak for simplicity  <cit> . jak <dig> and jak <dig> can combine with the receptors of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  but the signal transduction activities of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> may relate to specific types of jaks. the internal membrane proximal regions of jak <dig> and jak <dig> which responds to the ifn-gamma signal, bind the ifn-gamma receptor subunits ifngr <dig> and ifngr <dig>  <cit> . during il- <dig> signalling, jak <dig> and jak <dig> are activated via the conserved membrane proximal-binding domain of the receptors, and jak <dig> plays a major role in the signal response to il- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, guschin et al. suggested that, although jak <dig> was activated, it could not mediate the efficient activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation in the absence of jak <dig>  <cit> . thus, jak <dig> may share redundant functions with jak <dig>  in our model, we used two different jak species for ifn-gamma and il- <dig> receptors, respectively.

our model contains two main components: il- <dig> signalling via the jak/stat <dig> pathway and ifn-gamma signalling via the jak/stat <dig> pathway. there are multi-level interactions between the two pathways. the model contains  <dig> species,  <dig> kinetic parameters and  <dig> reactions, of which  <dig> reactions are based on previous models whereas  <dig> reactions were new. to make the experimental results easier to compare, if not specified otherwise, the concentrations of stat1* and stat3* were the sum of the concentrations of all species containing activated stat <dig> and stat <dig>  respectively, including their monomers and dimers.

responses of the crosstalk model to separate ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation
first, we stimulated the model with ifn-gamma  for  <dig> h and found that stat1* reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig> h, before it decreased rapidly due to the feedback inhibition of socs <dig> and shp <dig>  it finally reached a new steady state  after about  <dig> h. stat <dig> was activated to reach its maximum concentration  within about 1h and it decreased rapidly to the control level after  <dig> h, whereas the activation of stat <dig> was much stronger than stat <dig> after ifn-gamma stimulation . the signal transduction profiles of these molecules were consistent with previous experiment results, although there were some differences in the signal strength and duration  <cit> . next, we stimulated the model with il- <dig>  for  <dig> h and found that stat3* reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig>  h, before it decreased rapidly due to feedback inhibition from socs <dig> and shp <dig>  it reached a new steady state  after about  <dig> h. stat <dig> was activated and reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig>  h, before it decreased rapidly to the control level after  <dig>  h, whereas the activation of stat <dig> was much stronger than stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation . the signal transduction profiles of these molecules agreed with experiment results  <cit> . next, same kinetic affinities were set for ifnr and gp <dig> in stat <dig> and stat <dig>  respectively. as a result, ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation caused similar strong activation of stat <dig>  stat <dig>  socs <dig> and socs <dig> . the balanced activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> after ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation did not agree with previous experimental observations. these results demonstrated the validity of our unbalanced competition model.

we also investigated the signal transduction profiles of stat homo- and heterodimers in the nucleus after ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation, separately. after continuous stimulation with ifn-gamma  for  <dig> h,  <dig> reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig> h and it maintained a new steady state  after  <dig> h, whereas  <dig> only reached its maximal concentration  after  <dig> h . by contrast, il- <dig> stimulation  for  <dig> h made the  <dig> level reach its maximum concentration  within about  <dig>  h and it reached a new steady state  after about  <dig> h, whereas  <dig> only reached its maximal concentration  after  <dig>  h . our results confirmed the experimental observations of haan et al. who showed that il- <dig> stimulation led to stat <dig> homodimers predominating in the nucleus  <cit> . these results suggested that ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling preferentially activate nuclear stat homodimers. for the stat1/ <dig> heterodimers  in the nucleus, however, both ifn-gamma and il- <dig> could induce a similar concentration/strength, which reached its maximum concentration  in about  <dig> – <dig> h . ifn-gamma and il- <dig> could both activate stat <dig> and stat <dig>  but fewer stat1* and stat3* molecules were sequestered by stat1/ <dig> heterodimers, so its transcriptional activation function was repressed. when the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers was blocked, the maximum concentrations of * <dig> and * <dig> both increased to about  <dig> nm after ifn-gamma or il- <dig> stimulation . thus, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers enhanced the preferential signal transduction of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> 

shp- <dig> knockout simulations were also performed to characterize the effects of shp- <dig>  as shown in figure 2a–b, knocking out shp- <dig> enhanced the signal responses of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  which agreed with previous experimental observations. you et al. showed that ifn-gamma could induce a higher signal response in shp- <dig> null cells  <cit> . schapter et al. also reported that over-expression of an inactive shp- <dig> mutant in hepg <dig> cells enhanced stat activation after il- <dig> stimulation  <cit> . after ifn-gamma or il- <dig> stimulation, however, the jak/stat pathway exhibited different features to those when knocking out shp- <dig>  without shp- <dig>  ifn-gamma stimulation induced higher levels of stat1* and stat3*  than that in normal conditions . by contrast, il- <dig> stimulation induced rapid increases in stat1* and stat3*, the maximum concentrations of which reached  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively, which was about three times higher than that in normal conditions. after il- <dig> stimulation, we also observed that socs <dig> reached a peak value about  <dig> nm at  <dig> h, which inhibited signal transduction by il- <dig> and quickly caused the concentrations of stat1* and stat3* to drop to normal levels after  <dig> h . knockout simulations were also performed for socs <dig> and socs <dig>  as shown in figure 2c–d, knocking out socs <dig> enhanced the activation of stat <dig> after ifn-gamma stimulation, while knocking out socs <dig> enhanced the activation of stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation. our simulation results agreed with previous experimental observations. brysha et al. demonstrated that in vitro and in vivo hepatocytes lacking socs- <dig> exhibited prolonged activation of stat <dig> after ifn-gamma stimulation, which correlated with the dramatically increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of ifn-gamma  <cit> . niwa et al. reported that inhibition of socs <dig> expression enhanced the activation of stat <dig> and cell growth  <cit> . after ifn-gamma or il- <dig> stimulation, however, the jak/stat pathway exhibited different features when knocking out socs <dig> or socs <dig>  without socs <dig>  ifn-gamma stimulation induced higher levels of stat1* and stat3*  compared with those in normal conditions . without socs <dig>  however, il- <dig> stimulation induced increases in stat1* and stat3*, the maximum concentrations of which reached  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively, which were about double those in normal conditions. after il- <dig> stimulation, we also observed that shp- <dig> dropped to a low level of about  <dig> nm at  <dig> h, which attenuated signal transduction by il- <dig> and caused the concentrations of stat1* and stat3* to fall slowly after  <dig> h . thus, socs <dig> and socs <dig> had different interaction patterns with shp- <dig>  socs <dig> and shp- <dig> synergistically regulated signal transduction by ifn-gamma. knocking out socs <dig> or shp- <dig> enhanced the integral activation of stat <dig> induced by ifn-gamma stimulation. by contrast, socs <dig> and shp- <dig> regulated signal transduction by il- <dig> in a more complementary manner. knocking out shp- <dig> alone enhanced the rapid response of the il- <dig> signal, due to a compensatory increase in socs <dig>  knocking out socs <dig> also led to lower levels of shp- <dig>  which caused a slow decline in stat1* and stat3*  <dig> h after il- <dig> stimulation. simulations of the combined knockout of shp- <dig> and socs were performed to characterize their joint effects on ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulations. first, we stimulated the shp- <dig> and socs <dig> combined knockout model with ifn-gamma  for  <dig> h and found that stat1* reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig> h while stat3* reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig> h . ifn-gamma stimulation induced a similar strength of stat1* and stat3* in shp- <dig> and socs <dig> combined knockout conditions. we then stimulated the shp- <dig> and socs <dig> combined knockout model using il- <dig>  for  <dig> h and found that stat1* and stat3* both quickly reached their maximal concentration of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively, within about  <dig> h . il- <dig> stimulation also induced similar strengths of stat1* and stat3* in shp- <dig> and socs <dig> combined knockout conditions. thus, the combined knockout of shp- <dig> and socss abolished the preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  the unbalance competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> was not related directly to shp- <dig> and socss, but shp- <dig> and socss combined with the activated receptor complexes and inhibited signal transduction via the jak/stat pathway  <cit> . therefore, we deduced that shp- <dig> and socss could limit the concentration of active receptor complexes, which indirectly affected the preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  therefore, we investigated the signal transduction profiles of the activated receptor complexes in response to ifn-gamma and il- <dig> with and without knocking out shp- <dig> and/or socss. without any knockout, 2* reached its maximum concentration  in about  <dig>  h after ifn-gamma, before decreasing rapidly. after knocking out shp- <dig>  the level of 2* increased by about 120% compared with that in normal conditions. without socs <dig>  2* increased rapidly and reached a new steady state  after  <dig> h, whereas the combined knockout of shp- <dig> and socs <dig> caused the level of 2* to increase significantly, reaching  <dig>  nm in  <dig> h, which was about forty time as high as that in normal conditions . without any knockout and with il- <dig>  2* reached its maximum concentration  within about  <dig>  h, before decreasing rapidly. after knocking out shp- <dig>  2* increased rapidly and it reached its maximum concentration of  <dig>  nm in  <dig>  h, which was about nine times that in normal conditions, although it quickly returned to a normal level after  <dig>  h. with socs <dig> knock out, the 2* level increased and reached a new steady state  after  <dig> h. with the combined knockout of shp- <dig> and socs <dig>  the levels of 2* increased significantly and reached a new steady state  after  <dig> h, which was about  <dig> times that in normal conditions . the simulation results demonstrated that with the shp- <dig> and socss combined knockout, the levels of 2* and 2* increased significantly after ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation. stat <dig> and stat <dig> competed for the same motifs in ifnr and gp <dig>  but there was sufficient 2* and 2*, so the preferential activations of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> were abolished. these simulated observations still await further experimental verification.

responses of the crosstalk model after disrupting stat <dig> and stat3
the effect of stat <dig> on signal transduction via the jak/stat pathway was analyzed by varying the initial concentration of stat <dig> in a range of 0– <dig> nm. we found that changing the stat <dig> level did not significantly affect the state of stat1* after ifn-gamma stimulation , which was consistent with previous experimental observations  <cit> . by contrast, the level of stat1* was clearly affected by the initial stat <dig> concentration in response to il- <dig>  in particular, when stat <dig> was knocked out, stat <dig> was more phosphorylated and for longer, so stat1* reached its maximum concentration  in about  <dig> h, which was about double that in normal conditions. finally, it reached a new steady state  after about  <dig> h . this was consistent with previous experimental results, although there were some differences in the signal strength and duration  <cit> . the different signal responses to ifn-gamma and il- <dig> during stat <dig> disruption may explain why il- <dig>  but not ifn-gamma, could trigger apoptosis and inhibit the in vivo growth of human malignant t cells after knocking out stat <dig>  <cit> . next, we analyzed the effect of stat <dig> on signal transduction via the jak/stat pathway by varying the initial concentration of stat <dig> in a range of 0–2000nm. we found that changing the initial concentration of stat <dig> did not significantly affect the level of stat3* after il- <dig> stimulation . by contrast, the level of stat <dig> dramatically affected the status of stat3* after ifn-gamma stimulation. when we knocked out stat <dig> in our model, ifn-gamma stimulation also led to much stronger activation of stat <dig>  which caused a significant increase in the levels of stat3*. it finally reached a new steady state  after  <dig> h, which was about three times that in normal conditions . our simulation results were consistent with previous experimental observations  <cit> . therefore, ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling could mutually switch in the conditions of stat <dig> or stat <dig> knockout, which agreed very well with previous experimental observations  <cit> .

after ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation, the recruitment of stat <dig> and stat <dig> to the activated receptor complexes directly affected their phosphorylation, which has important roles in signal transduction by ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  <cit> . in our unbalanced competition model, stat <dig> and stat <dig> had different affinities for ifnr and gp <dig>  so we deduced that disrupting stat <dig> and stat <dig> may have different effects on the recruitment of stat <dig> and stat <dig>  next, we investigated the effect of changing the initial concentration of stat <dig> and stat <dig> on the associations of stats with activated receptor complexes in response to ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  our simulation results demonstrated that changing the concentration of stat <dig> had little effect on the formation of 2*-stat <dig> , whereas altering the stat <dig> level significantly affected the formation of 2*-stat <dig>  after ifn-gamma stimulation. our simulations also showed that the formation of 2*-stat <dig> was almost independent of stat <dig> disruption after il- <dig> stimulation, although changing the stat <dig> level significantly affected the formation of 2*-stat <dig>  therefore, the unbalanced competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> for ifnr and gp <dig> was not only the pivotal mechanism for the preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  but it also determined the recruitment of stat <dig> and stat <dig> to the activated receptor complexes.

responses of the crosstalk model to combined stimulation with ifn-gamma and il-6
we considered a combined stimulation protocol where the model was stimulated with ifn-gamma  and il- <dig>  together for  <dig> h. figure 4a shows that compared with the separate treatments, the combined stimulation induced higher activation of the jak/stat pathway. the dynamic responses of the jak/stat pathway were consistent with previous results reported in the literature  <cit> . in the previous section, we showed that ifn-gamma and il- <dig> could activate both stat <dig> and stat <dig>  which may explain the higher activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> after combined stimulation. however, when stat <dig> could only be activated by ifn-gamma and stat <dig> could only be activated by il- <dig>  combined stimulation still caused greater activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> than separate stimulation . thus, we inferred that other mechanism may play important roles in this phenomenon. pp <dig> and pp <dig> are two different types of phosphatases that dephosphorylate stat*s in the cytoplasm and nuclei, respectively  <cit> . in our model, the total amounts of both pp <dig> and pp <dig> were fixed and only the monomers could combine and dephosphorylate the newly generated stat*s. we then investigated the signal transduction profiles of pp <dig> and pp <dig> in response to ifn-gamma and/or il- <dig> stimulation, and we found that combined stimulation with ifn-gamma and il- <dig> could activate stat <dig> and stat <dig>  which resulted in lower levels of pp <dig> and pp <dig> than the separate treatments . after combined stimulation, the activation of stat <dig> prevented stat <dig> from being dephosphorylated and vice versa. this mechanism contributed to the higher activation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> after combined stimulation with ifn-gamma and il- <dig> 

signal transduction via the jak/stat pathway depended on the formation of stat homodimers  <cit> , which are regarded as the main transcription factors during ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling  <cit> . we further investigated whether combined stimulation with ifn-gamma and il- <dig> could induce higher * <dig> and * <dig> than separate treatments. figure 4a shows that  <dig> h after combined stimulation, the stat homodimers were not induced at a higher level than the separate treatments. however, stat1n*-stat3n* reached their maximum concentration  within about  <dig> h, which was about  <dig> time higher than the individual treatment. the formation of stat1n*-stat3n* greatly restricted the formation of stats homodimers. after we abolished the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers, the maximum concentrations of * <dig> and * <dig> increased to about  <dig> nm with combined stimulation . combined stimulation with ifn-gamma and il- <dig> led to greater activation of both stat <dig> and stat <dig>  but the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers played an important role in preventing mutual strengths between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling.

responses of the crosstalk model to successive ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation
we analyzed previous studies that focused on the interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling and found that their interactions were asymmetric. bluyssen et al. reported that pre-treatment of ec with ifn-gamma significantly decreased stat3* induction by il- <dig> without affecting the total amount of stat <dig>  <cit> . by contrast, kaur et al. reported that stat <dig> activation induced by ifn-gamma was mainly unchanged after pre-treatment il- <dig> or other gp130-related cytokines in sh-sy5y human neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . we tried to provide a reasonable explanation for the asymmetric interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> using simulation experiments with our model.

first, we stimulated the model with ifn-gamma  for  <dig> h, which we started  <dig> h prior to il- <dig>  stimulation. il- <dig> slightly increases the level of stat3*, but pre-treatment with ifn-gamma significantly decreased stat3* induction by il- <dig> . this was consistent with the results reported by bluyssen et al.  <cit> . socs <dig> is a negative regulator of il- <dig> signalling and it can be induced by ifn-gamma stimulation, so we deduced that socs <dig> may have an important role during inhibition. when we knocked out socs <dig>  the inhibitory effect of ifn-gamma on stat3* induction by il- <dig> was eliminated completely . these results showed that socs <dig> was an essential component in the inhibition of ifn-gamma to il- <dig> signalling. we also found that the expression of socs <dig> had a time delayed feedback, which significantly increased  <dig> h after ifn-gamma stimulation. therefore, we deduced that temporal pre-treatment with ifn-gamma may not have induced sufficient socs <dig> to inhibit il- <dig> signalling. figure 5c shows that temporal pre-treatment with ifn-gamma partly inhibited il- <dig> signalling and that the duration of pre-treatment with ifn-gamma needed to be longer than  <dig> h to achieve this inhibition. we then investigated how pre-treatment with il- <dig> affected the ifn-gamma signal response. our simulation results showed that pre-treatment with il- <dig> for  <dig> h only slightly reduced the amount of stat1* and did not inhibit the signal response of ifn-gamma , while changing the duration of the pre-treatment with il- <dig> still had no obvious effect on the signal response of ifn-gamma. moreover, pre-treatment for less than  <dig> h had almost no effect on the state of stat1* . these simulation results were consistent with the results reported by kaur et al.  <cit> . we inferred that the asymmetric interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling were related mainly to the different inhibition efficiencies of socs <dig> and socs <dig>  socs <dig> could be induced by * <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation, but socs <dig> induction by il- <dig> is not sufficient to inhibit ifn-gamma signalling. after ifn-gamma stimulation, however, socs <dig> could be induced by * <dig> and * <dig>  which achieved the inhibition from ifn-gamma to il- <dig> 

the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers also contributed to the asymmetric interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling. as previously described, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers enhanced the preferential signal transduction of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> by sequestering a fraction of stat1* and stat3*. after we abolished the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers, the maximum concentration of socs <dig> induced by il- <dig> increased to  <dig>  nm within about  <dig>  h, and il- <dig> exhibited a greater capacity for inhibiting ifn-gamma signalling . abolishing the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers also enhanced the inhibition from ifn-gamma to il- <dig> . in addition, the mechanism of  <dig> inducing socs <dig> also played an important role in the asymmetric interactions. the concentration of  <dig> induced by ifn-gamma stimulation was very low due to the sequestering effect of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers. therefore, we deduced that socs <dig> induction by  <dig> was not sufficient to achieve the inhibition from ifn-gamma to il- <dig>  indeed, when we abolished the * <dig> induction of socs <dig>  the inhibition from ifn-gamma to il- <dig> was clearly mitigated . ifn-gamma only slightly reduced the activation of stat <dig> induction by il- <dig>  which did not agree with previous experimental observations  <cit> . therefore,  <dig> induction of socs <dig> was essential for the inhibition from ifn-gamma to il- <dig> during signal transduction.

argument for the non-competitive model
ho et al. reported that stat <dig> did not affect the activation of stat <dig> during type i interferon responses  <cit> . they argued that stat <dig> did not suppress stat <dig> activation via tyrosine phosporylation and they excluded inhibitory mechanisms such as the competition for docking sites and the inhibition of signalling events upstream of stat <dig> tyrosine phosphorylation. based on their argument, we proposed an alternative hypothesis for the combined pattern between stats and the receptors for ifn-gamma and il- <dig> in addition to our previous competition model, which we refer to as the non-competitive model. in the non-competitive model, stat <dig> and stat <dig> do not compete for the same docking sites of ifnr and gp <dig>  so we considered that stat <dig> and stat <dig> could bind different phosphorylated docking sites in ifnr and gp <dig> via their sh <dig> domain. based on these considerations, we added the new biochemical reactions  -   to simulate the mutually independent combination of stat <dig> and stat <dig> with the receptor complexes. stat <dig> did not suppress the activation of stat <dig> via tyrosine phosphorylation, so we considered that the combination of stat <dig> with receptor complexes did not suppress the phosphorylation processes of stat <dig> and vice versa. based on these considerations, we added the new biochemical reactions  -  to simulate the mutually independent phosphorylation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> within receptor complexes. in addition, we estimated the parameters for reactions - and re-estimated the parameters for reactions - to fit the non-competitive model . detailed descriptions of the non-competitive model written in copsi  are available in additional file  <dig> 

first, we conducted simulation experiments using ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation separately, as in the previous study, and we aimed to estimate and optimize the parameters of the new non-competitive model. as shown in figure 6a-b, our computational simulation indicated that the activation of stat <dig> was much greater than stat <dig> after ifn-gamma stimulation, whereas the activation of stat <dig> was much greater than stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation, which agreed with previous experiment results despite some deviations in the signal strength and durations  <cit> . next, the same kinetic affinities were used for ifnr and gp <dig> with stat <dig> and stat <dig>  respectively. ifn-gamma and il- <dig> stimulation caused similar strong activation of stat <dig>  stat <dig>  socs <dig> and socs <dig> , which did not agree with previous experimental observations. these results demonstrated that the non-competitive model using our estimated parameter set could satisfy the basic simulation requirements and that it simulated the preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> 

next, we executed the same series simulation experiments described in the previous sections using the non-competitive model. we found that the non-competitive model approximately simulated the crosstalk between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling in all conditions , with the exception of the disrupted stat <dig> and stat <dig> conditions. figure 6e shows that when we fixed the concentration of stat <dig> at  <dig> nm and changed the concentration of stat <dig> from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> nm, the states of stat1* were obviously dependent on the level of stat <dig> after ifn-gamma stimulation. in particular, stat <dig> was more strongly phosphorylated, and for longer, with higher levels of stat <dig>  which were completely different from the experimental observations reported by regis et al.  <cit> . similarly, when we fixed the concentration of stat <dig> at  <dig> nm and changed the concentration of stat <dig> from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> nm, the states of stat3* were also obviously dependent on the level of stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation . moreover, stat <dig> was also more strongly phosphorylated and for longer with higher levels of stat <dig>  which did not agree with the experimental observations of dimberg et al.  <cit> . indeed, the activation of stats was determined by the swing between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes  <cit> . in the non-competitive model, stat <dig> and stat <dig> did not suppress the phosphorylation of each other, although they share the phosphatases pp <dig> and pp <dig>  so the activation of stat <dig> prevented stat <dig> from being dephosphorylated and vice versa. the disruption of the dynamic balance between the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of stat <dig> and stat <dig> meant the responses of the non-competitive model were hypersensitive to the initial concentrations of stat <dig> and stat <dig>  therefore, the non-competitive model may not reflect the crosstalk mechanisms between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling in a physiological environment. thus, alternative hypotheses should be proposed based on new experimental observations. here, we provide an integrated platform that facilitates the verification of possible hypotheses related to the crosstalk between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling in future work.

sensitivity analysis of the competition model
in this study, we used computational simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the competition model. next, we determined the dynamic characteristics of our model by sensitivity analysis. the calculations used in the sensitivity analysis are shown in the “methods” section. the upstream key regulatory molecules of  <dig> and  <dig> comprise cytokines, receptors, jak, stat1c, stat3c, pp <dig>  pp <dig>  and shp <dig>  and their initial concentrations were considered in the sensitivity analysis. first, we applied a sensitivity analysis to determine the relative sensitivity of these components using ifn-gamma stimulation as the input.

the results indicated that ifn-gamma, the receptor, jak, stat1c, and pp <dig> were relatively important components of the ifn-gamma-induced jak/stat signalling pathway . it was also noted that some of the initial concentrations, such as those of pp <dig> and stat3c, had little impact on the time course of  <dig>  in a previous simulation, we found that the decline in the concentration of pp <dig> was more obvious than that of pp <dig> during ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signal transduction . we deduced that the basic level of pp <dig> exceeded the demand of ifn-gamma transduction, which agreed with the conclusions of the previous study. the concentration of stat <dig> did not affect the activation of stat <dig>  as described in the previous section. moreover, we found that the parameters related to the key signalling components identified had relatively significant effects on the time course of  <dig>  as shown in figure 7b. the reactions with the most sensitive kinetic parameters were stat1c phosphorylation by the receptor complex of ifn-gamma and pp <dig> negative regulation. the socs <dig> synthesis, degradation, and negative regulation processes were also very sensitive, which confirmed the important role of the negative feedback factor socs <dig> during ifn-gamma signal transduction.

next, we performed a sensitivity analysis using il- <dig> stimulation as the input. the sensitivities of the initial concentrations and the critical kinetic parameters are shown in figure 7c and figure 7d. the results indicated that the reactions with pp <dig> negative regulation and jak combination were highly sensitive to il- <dig> stimulation. as described in previous sections, the concentration of stat <dig> did not significantly affect the activation of stat <dig> after il- <dig> stimulation, which was also confirmed by the sensitivity analysis. similarly, we found that the socs <dig> synthesis, degradation, and negative regulation processes were highly sensitive to il- <dig> stimulation, which confirmed the important role of the negative feedback factor socs <dig> during il-6signal transduction. in particular, we found that the phosphorylation of stat <dig> in stat1/ <dig> heterdimers in the nucleus also had a high impact on the state of  <dig>  overall, the sensitivity analysis determined the sensitive components and parameters during jak/stat signal transduction. these results provide valuable information that may inform further investigations of regulation and drug target identification in aberrant pathways. the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis of the competition model are shown in additional file 1: tables s6–s <dig> 

sensitivity analysis of the non-competitive model
we also investigated the dynamic characteristic of the non-competitive model by sensitivity analysis. first, we applied sensitivity analysis to determine the critical components with dominant effects where ifn-gamma stimulation was used as the input. figure 8a shows the sensitivities to the initial concentrations, while the sensitivities of the critical kinetic parameters are shown in figure 8b. there were some deviations in magnitude but the non-competitive model yielded similar sensitivity results to the competition model after ifn-gamma stimulation, except the concentration of stat3c had a higher sensitivity to  <dig> in the non-competitive model. this confirmed our previous conclusion that the responses of ifn-gamma in the non-competitive model were hypersensitive to the initial concentrations of stat <dig>  next, we performed a sensitivity analysis using il- <dig> stimulation as the input. figure 8c shows the sensitivities to the initial concentrations, while the sensitivities to the critical kinetic parameters are shown in figure 8d. we also found that the concentration of stat1c was highly sensitive to  <dig> in the non-competitive model. in the previous section, simulation results demonstrated the non-competitive model could not accurately reflect the signal transduction of il- <dig> and ifn-gamma under the condition of disrupting of stats. here, the sensitivity analysis confirmed the high sensitivity of stats in the non-competitive model. the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis of the non-competitive model are shown in additional file 1: tables s8–s <dig> 

discussion
the results were affected by the limitations of our model. it is important to consider these limitations because they form the basis for future improvements. first, we only considered three possible levels of crosstalk between ifnγ and il- <dig> systems. haan et al. showed that, after il- <dig> stimulation, stat <dig> phosphorylation was entirely dependent on jak <dig> kinase activity whereas stat <dig> activation was not  <cit> . qing et al. showed that, in response to ifn-gamma, scr-family kinases had to activate stat <dig>  via tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . some mechanisms that contribute to the specific signal responses of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> were not considered in this study. second, our computational model was a simplification of a biological process and it might not reflect the true regulatory mechanism for the signal interactions. third, the simulation results in this study were affected by assumptions made based on our experience, e.g., the stat1/ <dig> heterodimers could be dephosphorylated by pp <dig> and pp <dig> in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. fourth, our model had very rich dynamics parameters that were not fully explored in this study. for simplicity, protein turnover, receptor recycling, de novo synthesis and the degradation of transcription factors were not included in the current model. the ultimate aim of our research is to construct a universal model that accurately reflects the crosstalk between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signals. however, the signal responses to cytokines may be cell type-dependent. caldenhoven et al. reported that the activation of stat <dig> induced by ifn-gamma was lineage-specific in human neutrophils  <cit> . zhang et al. showed that il- <dig> stimulation could induce stat <dig> phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in m <dig>  r <dig> and u <dig> cells, although it had little effect on stat <dig> phosphorylation in 7td <dig> and tf <dig> cells  <cit> . bluyssen et al. argued that il- <dig> did not activate stat <dig> in ec  <cit> . furthermore, the concentrations of molecules within the jak/stat pathway, such as stats, are cell type-dependent  <cit> . the experimental data are limited and not systematic, so we had to create our model based on experimental observations of many different cell types, while we neglected certain contradictory experimental observations. therefore, it is not possible to expect that the dynamics predicted by our model will apply universally to all types of cells. thus, structure and parameters of the model may need some adjustment to reflect signal transduction by ifn-gamma and il- <dig> in certain cell types. finally, our crosstalk model was based on experimentally established interactions, but further experimental verification and improvements are required.

our simulation results showed that stat1/ <dig> heterodimers have three important functions during signal transductions from ifn-gamma to il- <dig>  first, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers enhances the preferential signal transduction by ifn-gamma and il- <dig> because it sequesters a fraction of stat1* and stat3*. second, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers prevents mutual reinforcement between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling. finally, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers limits the reciprocal inhibition of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling. in our simulations, therefore, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers dramatically affected the interaction between the ifn-gamma and il- <dig> systems, which suggests that stat1/ <dig> heterodimers may be a potential target for rectifying abnormal signal transduction by ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  the functional interference of stat <dig> homodimers using stat <dig> transcription decoys or small molecules in structure-activity relationship  studies could successfully inhibit the growth of tumour cells  <cit> . however, the therapeutic potential of altering the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers has not been fully investigated. thus, further research is still required.

this is the first effort to construct a mathematical model of the crosstalk between ifn and il- <dig> signalling. moreover, our simulation results and theoretical findings provide new insights into the dynamical integration of ifn and il- <dig> signals. the lack of experimental data and our current superficial understanding of signal transduction mean there are still many defects in our crosstalk model. we will follow current studies related to this issue and improve the quality and veracity of model in our future research.

CONCLUSIONS
based on previous models and new experimental observations, we developed the first crosstalk model of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling. this theoretical study successfully reproduced key experimental findings and reached some definitive conclusions. first, the unbalanced competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> for ifnr and gp <dig> led to preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  at the same time, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers enhanced preferential signal transduction by sequestering a fraction of stat1* and stat3*. moreover, socss with shp- <dig> limited the concentration of the activated receptor complexes of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  which also contributed to the preferential activation of ifn-gamma and il- <dig>  second, the unbalanced competition between stat <dig> and stat <dig> was the pivotal mechanism during the mutual switch between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signals after knocking out stat <dig> or stat <dig>  finally, the formation of stat1/ <dig> heterodimers prevented the mutual reinforcement of ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling, and also limited the reciprocal inhibition between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling. moreover, the process of stat <dig> homodimer induction of socs <dig> also contributed to asymmetric interactions between ifn-gamma and il- <dig> signalling.
