BACKGROUND
it is becoming increasingly clear that the microbiota condition and prime immunological function with an unexpected level of interdependence between bacteria and the immune system  <cit> . accumulating evidence suggests that certain bacterial strains provide protective signals while other bacterial strains stimulate aggressive and damaging immune responses  <cit> . in other words, the activity of the mammalian immune system seems to be governed by the balance between symbiotic and potentially pathogenic factors derived from our microbial inhabitants. this raises the possibility that dysbiosis can lead to inappropriate inflammatory responses while on the other hand certain well selected anti-inflammatory microbes may protect against aberrant inflammatory activity.

the most important aspect of immunological function is the ability to protect against infectious microbes. the host response to infection requires innate and acquired cellular and humoral immune reactions, designed to limit spread of the offending organism and to restore organ homeostasis  <cit> . however, to limit the aggressiveness of collateral damage to host tissues, a range of regulatory constraints may be activated, such as induction of t regulatory cells  <cit> . a successful immune response is characterized by the efficient elimination of the pathogenic organism with minimal inflammatory damage to the host and the associated inflammatory cascades which may promote inflammatory disease. innate pro-inflammatory signaling in response to microbial exposure is mediated by the activation of transcription factors, such as nf-κb, resulting in expression of a battery of effector molecules contributing to host defense and inflammation  <cit> . a number of bacterial products have been identified which directly block activation of the nf-κb pathway in epithelial cells via a range of novel mechanisms including the blockade of iκ-b poly-ubiquination by non-pathogenic salmonella strains or the enhancement of nf-κb export from the nucleus by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  <cit> . in addition, non-pathogenic microbes such as bifidobacterium infantis  <dig> have been demonstrated to limit excessive nf-κb activation via the induction of t regulatory cells  <cit> .

interest in the deliberate administration of microbes, or microbial metabolites, for the treatment of aberrant inflammatory activity associated with an exuberant immune response to pathogens is gaining momentum. the typical microbes which are currently being examined include bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, non-pathogenic e. coli and bacteroides strains  <cit> . the protective effects associated with these microbes are probably mediated by multiple mechanisms involving epithelial cells, dendritic cells and t cells. one such organism, bifidobacterium animalis ahc <dig> , has been previously shown to protect against salmonella typhimurium infection in murine models and helps resolve acute diarrhea in dogs  <cit> . however, the host immunological molecular events contributing to this protective mechanism have not been described. therefore, we have examined activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nf-κb in animals pretreated with b. animalis ahc <dig> or e. faecium sf <dig>  e. faecium sf <dig> has been previously described as a probiotic organism with immunomodulatory activity and we used this bacterial strain as a comparator microbe for b. animalis ahc <dig>  <cit> . in addition, we have examined the influence of b. animalis ahc <dig> on dendritic cell activation and t cell polarization. our data suggests that the b. animalis ahc <dig> protective effect is associated with modulation of nf-κb activity in vivo while in vitro studies demonstrate that dendritic cell recognition of this bacterium is associated with induction of cd25+foxp3+ t cells.

RESULTS
b. animalis ahc <dig> suppresses nf-κb activation in vivo
infection of mice with s. typhimurium results in potent activation of nf-κb systemically after  <dig> hours . representative animals were dissected and individual organs re-imaged for localisation of in vivo nf-κb activity . isolated ileum displayed specific areas of activation which macroscopically co-localized with peyer's patches. within the colon, a different pattern was observed with a single foci of high activity associated with a lower level of activation at the proximal and distal segments. isolated spleen and liver also displayed elevated nf-κb activity following  <dig> hours of s. typhimurium infection. placebo-fed animals displayed a significant up-regulation of nf-κb whole body activity after  <dig> hours infection . pre-feeding with b. animalis ahc <dig> significantly attenuated the activation of this pro-inflammatory transcription factor. in order to determine if the attenuation of nf-κb activity was bacterium-strain specific, additional mice were pre-fed e. faecium prior to s. typhimurium infection. up-regulation of nf-κb activity was similar in the placebo-fed animals and e. faecium-fed animals .

b. animalis ahc <dig> mucosal immunoregulatory activity
in order to determine if lymphocytes within the mucosa could be influenced by b. animalis ahc <dig> consumption, healthy mice were administered the bacterial strain or placebo for  <dig> weeks. peyer's patch lymphocytes displayed an altered cytokine secretion profile following in vitro stimulation. anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibody stimulation of peyer's patch cells from b. animalis ahc <dig> fed animals secreted significant lower levels of ifn-γ and tnf-α . in contrast, secretion of il- <dig> was unaltered while il-12p <dig> levels were increased  compared to placebo-fed animals . no differences were noted for il- <dig> or mcp- <dig> levels  or for the un-stimulated cultures. in addition, no alteration in anti-cd3/cd <dig> stimulated mesenteric lymph node secretion of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il-12p <dig>  tnf-α, ifn-γ or mcp- <dig> was observed for b. animalis ahc7-fed animals compared to placebo-fed controls .

b. animalis ahc <dig> interaction with dendritic cells
human monocyte derived dendritic cells  were co-incubated with cfse-labelled b. animalis ahc <dig> in vitro and imaged for evidence of bacterial binding. cfse labeled b. animalis ahc <dig> was easily visualized on the cell surface of cd11c+ mddcs indicating efficient binding of this bacterium by human myeloid dendritic cells . in addition, mddcs secreted il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> in response to b. animalis ahc <dig> . indeed, il- <dig> secretion in response to this microbe was significantly greater than the mddc response to lps while the level of il-12p <dig> secretion was equivalent to that induced by lps.

b. animalis ahc <dig> conditioned dendritic cells influence t cell polarisation
following co-incubation with b. animalis ahc <dig> for  <dig> hours, mddcs were extensively washed and co-incubated with autologous cd4+ t cells for  <dig> days. t cells were re-stimulated with anti-cd3/cd <dig> antibodies for  <dig> days and transcription factor levels quantified by flow cytometry. b. animalis ahc7-stimulated mddcs induced significantly more cd25+foxp3+ t cells compared to non-stimulated mddcs or lps stimulated mddcs .

discussion
this report illustrates, at a cellular and molecular level, the impact of the commensal microbiota on host immune defense and immune homeostasis. the deliberate consumption of one commensal organism, b. animalis ahc <dig>  resulted in the attenuation of nf-κb activation within mice infected with a pro-inflammatory translocating microbe, s. typhimurium. in addition, b. animalis ahc <dig> consumption was associated with modulation of cytokine signaling within the mucosa of healthy animals. in vitro, dendritic cells bound b. animalis ahc <dig>  secreted il- <dig> and il-12p <dig>  and dendritic cells stimulated with b. animalis ahc <dig> enhanced foxp <dig> expression in naïve t cells.

infection by microbes such as salmonella species results in severe immunopathology characterized by loss of intestinal barrier function, tissue cell death and loss of function, fever and ultimately can lead to death of the host  <cit> . the pathology is not only a direct effect of the microbe itself but is a consequence of the inflammatory response induced by the presence of the organism. therefore salmonella infection of mice is a good model system to examine the regulatory mechanisms which protect against excessive pro-inflammatory responses to a range of pro-inflammatory stimuli and not only salmonella itself. the resident microbiota can aid in the protection against aberrant inflammatory activity as suggested by studies in germ-free mice where infection with s. typhimurium results in colitis which was not observed in conventionally colonized animals  <cit> . in addition, specific commensal organisms such as b. animalis ahc <dig> protect against s. typhimurium infection and disease severity  <cit> . while b. animalis ahc <dig> may directly antagonize salmonella within the gastrointestinal tract, this is unlikely to be the primary mechanism as other commensal organisms which were significantly more effective than b. animalis ahc <dig> at killing s. typhimurium in vitro, did not protect against infection in vivo  <cit> . these studies suggest that the biological activity of certain commensal microbes is exerted well beyond a direct influence on the microbiota within the gastrointestinal tract. therefore, we investigated whether b. animalis ahc <dig> could exert an effect on the host via regulation of the pro-inflammatory response as a potential mechanism underpinning its protective effect.

s. typhimurium infects the host via intestinal epithelial cells and dendritic cells. in addition, salmonella infects via m cells which transport the bacterium to underlying peyer's patches for immunological processing  <cit> . infection of the peyer's patches leads to recruitment of a large number of pro-inflammatory infiltrating leukocytes which further aggravate intestinal inflammation and promote systemic dissemination of the pathogen. b. animalis ahc <dig> consumption leads to an altered cytokine profile within peyer's patches which may protect against excessive inflammation. release of tnf-α and ifn-γ by stimulated peyer's patch lymphocytes in vitro is significantly reduced. in contrast, release of the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig> is enhanced with no alteration in il- <dig>  il- <dig> or mcp- <dig> levels. interpretation of these results is complex as ifn-γ and il- <dig> are both considered to be th <dig> cytokines. il-12p <dig> is released by cells of the innate immune system, such as dendritic cells, while ifn-γ is secreted by t cells suggesting that b. animalis ahc <dig> consumption may differentially regulate dendritic cell and t cell cytokine production. in vitro, b. animalis stimulated dendritic cells secrete il- <dig> and therefore the increased il- <dig> release by peyer's patch cells may be dendritic cell derived. regardless of the mechanism, it is clear that in vitro stimulated cytokine responses from peyer's patch cells are modulated by b. animalis ahc <dig> consumption and it is likely that these altered responses contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect observed in the salmonella model. in particular, reduced secretion of tnf-α, which is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, would reduce the inflammatory burden following s. typhimurium infection.

innate immune activation to salmonella is mediated via pattern recognition receptors, such as tlr- <dig>  which rapidly up-regulate nf-κb activity  <cit> . both mucosal and systemic nf-κb activation in response to salmonella infection was noted suggesting that widespread activation of the innate immune system occurs rapidly and this response is modulated by b. animalis ahc <dig> consumption. the molecular basis for this inhibitory activity is not known and may involve induction of suppressor molecules, induction of regulatory cells , down-regulation of tlr expression and/or activity and enhancement of the mucosal immunological barrier. previously we have shown that increased numbers of cd25+foxp3+ t cells can reduce nf-κb activation in vivo  <cit> . we did not assess cd25+foxp3+ t cell polarization in b. animalis ahc7- fed animals but the in vitro co-culture model using b. animalis conditioned dendritic cells clearly demonstrated that this bacterium can induce a dendritic cell response which induces cd25+foxp3+ t cells. however, it remains to be determined if this mechanism is responsible for the b. animalis ahc <dig> anti-inflammatory effect in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
nf-κb is a key pro-inflammatory transcription factor and improved regulation of nf-κb is an important therapeutic target in a wide range of pro-inflammatory states, including sepsis  <cit> . this report supports the clinical evaluation of appropriately selected probiotic/commensal micro-organisms, such as b. animalis ahc <dig>  for the promotion of regulatory mechanisms in vivo which limit aberrant pro-inflammatory activity. however, it is clear from this study and others that not all commensal microbes modulate host immunological activity in the same way and the defining features of potent anti-inflammatory microbes remain to be described.
