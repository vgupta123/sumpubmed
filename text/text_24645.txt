BACKGROUND
insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  is a polypeptide trophic factor playing important roles in the survival and differentiation of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells  <cit> . the biological actions of igf- <dig> are mediated by a heterotetrameric tyrosine kinase receptor, the igf- <dig> receptor, which is similar to the insulin receptor both in structure and functions  <cit> . binding of igf- <dig> to its receptor causes receptor autophosphorylation and the activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase. activated receptor kinase phosphorylates various intracellular proteins like the insulin receptor substrate- <dig>  and shc  <cit> , leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways including the phosphatidylinositide  <dig> kinase /akt pathways and the mitogen-activated protein  kinase .

akt, a key target of the pi <dig> kinase, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays critical roles in the modulation of cell development, growth and survival  <cit> . stimulation of cells with igf- <dig> induces the activation of pi <dig> kinase leading to increased levels of phosphatidylinositol  <cit>  diphosphate  and phosphatidylinositol  <cit>  triphosphate  in target cells  <cit> . this event recruits akt to the plasma membrane where it is phosphorylated by pi  <cit>  p <dig> dependent kinase, - <dig> and - <dig>  respectively at residues thr <dig> and ser <dig>  <cit> . the phosphorylation of these residues activates akt kinase which can then phosphorylate its many substrates including glycogen synthase kinase- <dig>   <cit> , the bcl- <dig> family member bad  <cit> , caspase- <dig>  <cit> , nuclear factor-κb   <cit>  and the winged-helix family of transcription factors, foxo <dig>  foxo3a and foxo <dig>  <cit> , leading to cell survival and the inhibition of apoptosis  <cit> .

the ca2+/cyclic amp response element-binding protein  is one of the common nuclear targets of tyrosine kinase receptors playing important roles in many biological functions including neuronal plasticity, full axonal development, memory consolidation, and neuroprotection  <cit> . this transcriptional factor belongs to the creb/atf family and binds to the specific sequence, 5'-tgacgtca-3' known as cre  <cit> . activation of this transcription factor requires the phosphorylation of the ser- <dig> residue which increases its association with creb-binding protein  <cit> . several kinases including cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase , protein kinase-c , calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, mapk/p <dig> mapk/mapkap kinase- <dig>  ribosomal s <dig> kinase  family of kinases, the mitogen and stress-activated protein kinases  <dig>  and akt have been shown to be capable of phosphorylating this protein on ser- <dig> residue  <cit> .

igf-i stimulates the phosphorylation of creb and regulates the expression of a number of cre-containing genes including bcl- <dig> and c-fos in several cell types  <cit> . interestingly, creb is reported as a possible target of akt  <cit>  suggesting that it may be a target of akt in igf- <dig> mediated survival. however, reports about akt as a creb kinase in igf- <dig> signalling is still rather controversial with one report suggesting that the phosphorylation of creb induced by igf- <dig> is independent on akt  <cit> . moreover, the signalling of creb and akt is cell type-dependent and effectors specific  <cit> . therefore, it is deemed important to clarify the role of akt in the phosphorylation of creb induced by igf- <dig>  accordingly, we characterized here the signalling of igf- <dig> stimulated activation of creb compared to that of the pi3k/akt in pc <dig> cells. our data show that igf- <dig> promotes the phosphorylation of akt and creb in these cells. the activation of akt is mainly mediated by the pi <dig> kinase pathway, while that of creb is primarily dependent on the activation of mapk and p38-map kinases revealing the differential regulation of these two proteins by igf- <dig> receptor signalling. it also argues against a key role for akt as a creb kinase in pc <dig> cells. the survival study suggests that the activation of these two proteins likely contributes to the survival effects of igf- <dig> in pc <dig> cells, with the pi3k/akt kinase pathway playing a predominant role.

RESULTS
igf- <dig> stimulates the phosphorylation of akt and creb in pc <dig> cells
to investigate the effect of igf- <dig> on the activation/phosphorylation of akt and creb in neuronal cells, pc <dig> cells were treated with 1– <dig> nm igf- <dig> and the phosphorylation of akt and creb evaluated as described in methods. figure  <dig> shows that igf- <dig> induced the sustained phosphorylation of akt while a transient phosphorylation was seen for creb. in the case of creb, one additional band with a lower molecular weight was seen in the blot. this band represents p-atf which has 100% homologous consensus phosphorylation sequence with creb and cross react with the anti-pcreb antibody  <cit> . treatment of pc <dig> cells with  <dig> nm igf- <dig> caused a 3– <dig> fold increase in the phosphorylation of akt at ser- <dig>  the phosphorylation reached the highest level at  <dig>  min and remained unchanged for over  <dig> min. the phosphorylation of creb at ser- <dig> was increased 2– <dig> fold by  <dig> nm igf- <dig>  the induction of creb phosphorylation was evident at  <dig> min, peaked at about  <dig> min and decreased thereafter . igf- <dig> also concentration-dependently stimulated the phosphorylation of akt and creb in pc <dig> cells. the effect of igf- <dig> on akt was seen at concentration as low as  <dig>  nm while about  <dig> nm was required to induce the phosphorylation of creb .

the phosphorylation of akt by igf- <dig> is mediated by pi <dig> kinase while mapk and p <dig> mapk regulate igf- <dig> induced phosphorylation of creb
having established that igf- <dig> can induce the phosphorylation of akt and creb, we studied next the signaling pathways mediating the action of igf- <dig>  pc <dig> cells were pretreated with various kinase inhibitors before adding igf- <dig>  figure  <dig>  demonstrates that  <dig> nm igf- <dig> causes a 3– <dig> fold increase in the phosphorylation of akt. pre-treatment with the pi <dig> kinase inhibitor, ly <dig> , blocked igf- <dig> induced activation of akt while slightly enhancing the phosphorylation of creb . in contrast, the mek inhibitor pd <dig> , the p <dig> s <dig> kinase pathway inhibitor rapamycin , and the p <dig> mapk kinase inhibitor pd <dig>  failed to significantly alter igf-1-induced akt phosphorylation while partially but significantly attenuating that of creb. additional experiments revealed that the inhibitory effect of ly <dig> on igf-1-induced akt phosphorylation was concentration-dependent  with a maximal effect observed at  <dig> μm.

to extend these results further, wortmannin, another well known pi <dig> kinase inhibitor, was investigated in our model. wortmannin  had no effect on igf- <dig> stimulated phosphorylation of creb but most significantly blocked that of akt demonstrating further the differential mechanisms used by igf- <dig> to regulate their phosphorylation .

mapk kinase and p <dig> map kinase inhibitors concentration-dependently inhibit igf-1-induced phosphorylation of creb
to investigate in detail the role of mapk and p <dig> mapk kinases on the phosphorylation of creb, well established inhibitors of these two pathways were used. as shown in figure  <dig>  the mapk pathway inhibitor, pd <dig>  concentration-dependently inhibited igf- <dig> stimulated phosphorylation of creb  and map kinase . similarly, figure  <dig> shows that the phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and creb is concentration-dependently inhibited by a p <dig> mapk specific inhibitor, pd <dig> 

pma attenuates igf-1-induced phosphorylation of akt while increasing creb phosphorylation
we have previously shown that the activation of pkc by pma attenuated the phosphorylation of akt induced by igf- <dig>  <cit> . we explored here the effects of such a treatment on akt versus creb phosphorylation induced by igf- <dig>  pretreatment with pma attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of irs- <dig> as we reported in our previous study  <cit> , and akt while enhancing the phosphorylation of creb .

treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocks igf- <dig> receptor signaling, including the phosphorylation of akt and creb
having established that igf- <dig> stimulated the phosphorylation of akt via a pi <dig> kinase pathway while that of creb was mediated by the mapk and p <dig> map kinase pathways, we studied next the upstream events involved in these effects. igf- <dig> stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of igf-1r , irs- <dig>  and its association with pi <dig> kinase , as well as those of akt and creb . pretreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin a, inhibited these actions of igf- <dig> . hence, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the igf- <dig> receptor is essential for the activation/phosphorylation of these downstream signaling proteins.

both akt and creb can contribute to the survival effects of igf- <dig> in pc <dig> cells
effects of other trophic factors and agents in the phosphorylation of creb
to compare the effect of other factors and agents to that of igf- <dig> on the phosphorylation of creb, pc <dig> cells were treated with igf- <dig>  egf, fgf, fbs, pma and the calcium ionophore a <dig>  and the phosphorylation of creb. treatments with  <dig> nm egf,  <dig> nm fgf, 10% fbs,  <dig> nm pma and  <dig> μm a <dig> significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of creb that are comparable to the effect of igf- <dig> .

discussion
the present study demonstrates that igf- <dig> is able to time- and concentration-dependently stimulates the activation of both akt and creb in pc <dig> cells. the activation of akt by igf- <dig> is mediated by the pi <dig> kinase pathway while mapk and p <dig> mapk are involved in igf- <dig> induced phosphorylation of creb. survival assay revealed that these various pathways contribute to the survival effects of igf- <dig> in pc <dig> cells.

igf-i is a polypeptide trophic factor capable of supporting growth and of preventing death in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. the biological functions of this growth factor are mediated by igf-i receptors. recent studies have shown that both igf- <dig> and its receptors are expressed in the cns  <cit> , and their respective expression is upregulated in response to injuries  <cit> . it is also well established that igf- <dig> protects the brain from hypoxic and ischemic injuries  <cit> . igf- <dig> is also neuroprotective in a broad range of cells including cultured primary hippocampal neurons. these neuroprotective effects likely involve multiple signaling pathways but in particular the pi3k/akt kinase and mapk-creb pathways  <cit> . consistent with these findings, our results show here that igf- <dig> is able to stimulate the activation of both the pi3k/akt kinase and mapk-creb pathways in pc <dig> cells.

although mechanisms underlying the phosphorylation of creb have been extensively studied, the role of a given signaling pathway in mediating the effect of a trophic factor on creb remains somewhat controversial. for example, while akt has been suggested to act as a 'creb kinase', data obtained here are not fully supportive of such an hypothesis. indeed while igf- <dig> induced the sustained phosphorylation of akt, only a transient one was seen for creb. moreover, inhibitors of pi3k/akt blocked the activation/phopsphorylation of akt with almost no effect on the phosphorylation of creb. in contrast, mapk and p <dig> kinase inhibitors significantly diminished igf-1-induced phosphorylation of creb while only having a small effect on akt. indeed, the mapk pathway inhibitor pd <dig> and the p <dig> mapk kinase inhibitor, pd <dig>  at concentrations fully inhibiting mapk and p <dig> kinase respectively, significantly abrogated the phosphorylation of creb while having no significant effect on the activation of akt. moreover, the phosphorylation of creb induced by igf- <dig> is not inhibited by akt inhibitors at concentrations that fully blocked the phosphorylation of gsk3β, a target of akt in the igf- <dig> signaling pathway . finally, pma, an activator of pkc, attenuated igf-1-induced activation of akt while enhancing the phosphorylation of creb. taken together, these data reveal that igf-1-induced phosphorylation of akt and creb is mediated via distinct pathways and suggest that creb is not a direct substrate of akt in igf- <dig> receptor signaling in pc <dig> cells.

in fact, mapk and p <dig> mapk most likely contribute to the phosphorylation of creb stimulated by igf- <dig> in pc <dig> cells. however, the existence of kinase which can actually phosphorylate creb at ser- <dig> has not been reported in pc <dig> cells. mapk and p <dig> mapk cannot directly phosphorylate creb at this residue as it is not a proline-directed phosphorylation site  <cit> . downstream targets of these two kinases that may be able to phosphorylate creb in pc <dig> cells include the ribosomal s <dig> kinase  family of kinases, mapkap kinase 2/ <dig> and msk1/ <dig>  for example, the over-expression of inhibitory rsk <dig> mutants reduced egf-induced creb phosphorylation  <cit>  while cells deficient for this kinase were found to be resistant to egf-stimulated creb phosphorylation  <cit> . however, rsk-2-deficient cell lines have shown that this kinase is not essential for the activation of creb in response to pdgf and igf- <dig>  <cit> .

mapkap kinase- <dig>  an enzyme immediately downstream of p <dig> map kinase, is able to phosphorylate creb at ser <dig> in vitro, and has been suggested to play an important role in fgf- or stress-induced phosphorylation of creb and atf- <dig> in sk-n-mc cells  <cit> . however, a subsequent report using pc <dig>  hela and sk-n-mc cell lines failed to demonstrate a role for both rsk <dig> and mapkap-2/ <dig> as creb kinases in signalling induced by tnf, ngf and fgf  <cit> . the potential role of this kinase in igf- <dig> induced creb phosphorylation in pc <dig> cells hence remains to be fully established.

msk <dig> is a downstream kinase of the mapk and p <dig> mapk kinase pathways and is important in stress and mitogen-induced creb phosphorylation in fibroblasts, pc <dig> cells and embryonic stem cells  <cit> . since both mapk and p <dig> mapk are involved in igf- <dig> induced phosphorylation of creb in pc <dig> cells, msk <dig> is thus a possible intermediate step. consistent with this hypothesis, preliminary data have shown that blockade of msk <dig> significantly inhibited igf- <dig> stimulated phosphorylation of creb in pc <dig> cells .

the biological significance of the finding that distinct pathways are involved in igf- <dig> induced phosphorylation of akt and creb is not clear. both proteins are known to play central roles in cell survival  <cit> . the role of akt in cell survival was proposed first by dudek and colleagues  in a study showing that igf-1-induced survival of cultured cerebellar granule cells was mediated by this kinase  <cit> . subsequently, akt was shown to be a key survival promoting kinase for a broad of range of factors in a variety of cell type  <cit> . it is known that activated akt can phosphorylate and hence inactivate proapoptotic proteins such as the bcl- <dig> family member bad  <cit> , caspase- <dig>  <cit> , gsk <dig>  <cit> , foxo transcription factors  <cit>  and ask <dig>  <cit> . akt can also affect the expression of bcl- <dig> family members in target cells as well as the function of nf-kappab and creb  <cit> .

the mapk-creb pathway was also reported to play a major role in neuronal survival including in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . for example, mapk can activate rsks and msk1/ <dig>  <cit> . rsks are then able to phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic protein bad at ser- 112suppressing bad-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . rsks and possibly msk1/ <dig> are also able to facilitate the phosphorylation of creb at ser- <dig>  leading to cell survival. accordingly, the akt and mapk-creb pathways likely have additive effects in contributing to the survival effects induced by igf- <dig> in pc <dig> cells. this is also exemplified by the action of akt and mapk in the phosphorylation of bad. in the presence of growth factors, akt is activated and phosphorylates bad at ser- <dig>  inhibiting its pro-apoptotic effect  <cit> . in parallel, the activation of mapk leads to the phosphorylation of ser- <dig> further inhibiting bad  <cit> . hence, igf- <dig> by acting via the igf- <dig> receptor complex and parallel downstream effectors can inhibit various pro-apoptotic signals in a variety of cells including pc <dig> cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study shows that igf-1-induced phosphorylation of akt kinase is mediated by the pi <dig> kinase pathway while that of creb is regulated mainly by activating the mapk and p <dig> mapk pathways.
