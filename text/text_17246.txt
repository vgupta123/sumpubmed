BACKGROUND
brassinolide  was identified in  <dig> through its ability to promote internode growth  <cit> . since then, the growth-promoting effect has been studied in hundreds of articles. excised tissues , protoplasts, cell suspension cultures, intact seedlings, and whole plants were subjected to brassinosteroid  treatments, and in all cases br had the potential to stimulate growth  <cit> . a large number of br deficient and br insensitive mutants in arabidopsis thaliana and in crops such as rice, tomato, and pea were identified  <cit> . these mutants are generally dwarfed and exhibit rounded, dark green leaves, delayed flowering, reduced male fertility and seed set, and delayed senescence. further proven roles of br include the control of xylem formation  <cit> , stomata development  <cit> , and further developmental processes  <cit> . numerous studies analysed gene expression patterns upon br treatment and br deficiency. however, these studies barely clarified the metabolic and physiological basis of br dependent growth because the precise functions of isoenzymes, cell wall proteins, and other factors often remains obscure.

br plays non redundant roles since it is not possible to complement br mutants with other phytohormones or their antagonists  <cit> . overexpression of the major br receptor, bri <dig> , stimulated growth. however, the underlying changes at transcript and metabolite level are largely different from other growth-stimulating pathways  <cit> . the most prominent direct br effect is the modification of gene expression patterns  <cit> . transcription factors such as bes <dig>  and bzr <dig>  regulate br responsive genes  <cit> . the physiological mechanisms underlying br promoted growth appear to be manifold, and depend on the tissue and developmental stage  <cit> . they include the control of aquaporin activity and water movement across membranes  <cit> , cytoskeleton organisation  <cit> , and the modification of mechanical cell wall properties  <cit> . a few studies in arabidopsis and crops addressed the influence of br on primary metabolism. the focus of these studies was on photosynthesis and sink strength, and specific enzyme activities or metabolites were measured. an early article showed that br stimulates co <dig> assimilation in wheat  <cit> . this finding was confirmed in other plants such as cucumber  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . in arabidopsis, expression of a mutated bri <dig> receptor  enhanced shoot growth and conferred elevated photosynthetic rates and starch levels at the end of the light period  <cit> . rubisco activity and regeneration of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate are the most important limiting factors of photosynthesis under natural conditions. positive effects of br on rubisco activity have been shown  <cit> . yu et al.  <cit>  also postulated a positive effect on ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate-regeneration. enhanced photosynthesis correlated with an increase of soluble sugar and starch content and parallel enhancement of fresh and dry weights. in line with these data, br deficient arabidopsis mutants showed drastically reduced co <dig> assimilation rates, reduced starch levels, a tendency to reduced sucrose levels, and reduced biomass accumulation  <cit> .

in addition to source efficiency, br also increases sink strength. the tomato dx mutant produces bioactive br in fruits but not in the shoot, and provides an option to dissect br dependent processes in fruits and shoots. dry weight and starch levels of dx fruits were significantly reduced  <cit> . br application to leaves partly normalized metabolic changes in dx fruits suggesting that shoot-derived br dependent factors are required for proper fruit metabolism. previous research emphasized the relevance of br for invertase activity in the growing zone of tomato hypocotyls  <cit> . thus, several reports demonstrated the requirement of br for source efficiency and sink strength.

in this study, induced br deficiency was analysed in arabidopsis rosette leaves by means of complementary time-series experiments. first, br deficient plants were complemented by exogenous br. subsequent omission of br treatment caused br deficiency. secondly, brassinazole  was applied to wild-type plants. brz binds to the dwf <dig> enzyme and specifically blocks br biosynthesis at the c- <dig> hydroxylation step  <cit> . br dependent growth of established leaves is associated with elevated starch levels, higher metabolic flux through the tricarboxylic acid  cycle, and increased cell expansion and biomass production.

RESULTS
time course experiments for the analysis of morphological and biochemical consequences of br deficiency
the analysis of br deficient or br insensitive mutants is complicated by the severe dwarfism and major morphological changes  <cit> . the use of mutants with mild phenotypic changes such as cbb1/dwf <dig>   <cit>  can alleviate that difficulty. the known alleles result in milder phenotypic changes in comparison to det <dig> , cpd , dwf <dig> , and other biosynthetic mutants. the cbb1/dwf <dig> mutants are presumably able to produce unusual bioactive br as a consequence of the accumulation of precursors and display altered br responses  <cit> .

in order to start the analysis of br deficiency symptoms with morphologically intact plants, two complementary sets of time course experiments were performed . during the time course experiments, plants were grown in parallel in a randomized manner in a controlled growth chamber . the time course experiments were performed three times each, resulting in a total of six independent experiments.figure  <dig> 
design of time series experiments. plants were grown on soil for 5 weeks in controlled growth chambers under the specified conditions. black bars indicate a treatment of the plants with brassinolide  or brassinazole . samples were taken at day  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ld, long day; sd, short day; cn, cold night.



the first approach used br deficient mutants. cpd-antisense  plants and the br-deficient cbb1/dwf1- <dig> mutant  <cit>  were treated with  <dig> nm brassinolide  for three weeks. wild-type plants were grown in parallel and were simultaneously treated with a control solution. the control solution was identical to the br solution apart from the addition of br . br supplementation fully normalized the morphology and biomass production of cpd-antisense plants. the cpd-antisense plants were nearly indistinguishable from the wild type. the growth defect of cbb <dig> plants was partly complemented by exogenous br . fresh weight of 21-day-old cbb <dig> shoots was identical to the wild type. however, leaf length and width were diminished in comparison to the wild type, leaves were more erect and had a slightly crinkled surface, and rosettes appeared compact. thus, exogenous br could not fully substitute for endogenous br. after three weeks, br treatment was stopped . the cpd-antisense and cbb <dig> plants started to run into br deficiency or pronounced br deficiency, respectively. at this point the sampling began. samples for biochemical analysis were taken at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after the respective treatment was stopped. under the applied conditions, plants were in the vegetative phase during the complete experiments and did not start bolting.figure  <dig>

the second approach used wild-type plants  that were grown for three weeks without any treatment . subsequently, plants were treated with 10 μm brz, 20 μm brz, or control solution. lower concentrations such as  <dig> to 5 μm brz have previously been applied in synthetic growth medium  but were inapplicable in our time course experiments since they induced only minor growth effects in soil-grown plants. the necessity for higher brz concentrations may reflect weaker uptake by leaves through a functional epidermis. after the onset of brz application , samples for biochemical analysis were taken at the same points in time as described above .figure  <dig>

the parallel analysis of cpd-antisense, cbb <dig>  and brz treated wild-type plants allows avoiding genotype- or treatment-specific limitations during the evaluation of br deficiency.

elevated cpd and dwf <dig> transcript levels indicate emerging br deficiency
the cpd  <cit>  and dwf <dig>  <cit>  genes encode enzymes involved in br biosynthesis. the expression of these genes is negatively associated with endogenous br levels. high transcript levels indicate low br levels and vice versa  <cit> . cpd and dwf <dig> transcript levels were analysed by means of quantitative rt-pcr .figure  <dig>

transcript levels. plants were grown and harvested as described in figure  <dig>  a, relative cpd transcript levels in wild-type  and cbb <dig> plants. b, relative dwf <dig> transcript levels in wild-type, cpd-antisense, and cbb <dig> plants. c, relative cpd transcript levels in brz treated plants. d, relative dwf <dig> transcript levels in brz treated plants. eif1a ct values were subtracted from respective ct values of the gene of interest resulting in dct. subsequently, differences were subtracted from an arbitrary value . higher numbers indicate higher transcript levels. a difference of one unit indicates a fold change of two. data are given as mean ± se of gene of interest in three technical replicates. the data shown are from one experiment representative of three independent biological replicates.



unchanged transcript levels one day after the br supplementation was stopped or after the brz treatment was started may indicate the presence of remaining br or a time lag in the induction of br biosynthetic genes. stronger differences were observed from day  <dig> onwards. cpd transcript levels in cpd-antisense plants were previously described  <cit> . due to incomplete cpd gene repression, the phenotypic changes of cpd-antisense plants are considerably milder in comparison to the cpd/cbb <dig> knock-out mutant and other br deficient mutants such as cbb1/dwf1- <dig>  <cit> . stronger dwf <dig> expression in the cbb <dig> mutant in comparison to the cpd-antisense plants corresponds to the observed growth defect . only minor differences were detected between plants treated with different concentrations of brz. application of 10 μm brz induced cpd and dwf <dig> expression nearly as effectively as 20 μm brz .

induced br deficiency impairs leaf expansion
significant differences in shoot fresh weight and length of rosette leaves three and four developed after one day in cbb <dig> plants . both growth parameters of cpd-antisense plants became significantly different from the wild type after six days and one day, respectively . at the end of the analysed period , cbb <dig> and cpd-antisense plants had 36% and 68% of the wild-type fresh weight, respectively . br deficiency caused a less pronounced effect on leaf width . the resulting decrease in the leaf index  is a well described feature of br deficient plants . brz treated plants exhibited a small reduction in the shoot fresh weight at day  <dig> . the biomass difference to control plants increased over time. leaf length and leaf width were reduced. similarly to the cpd-antisense and cbb <dig> plants, leaf width was less affected than leaf length .

leaf thickness depends on the br level and genotype. for example, br deficient mutants such as det <dig> exhibited an increased leaf thickness. low concentrations of exogenous br decreased leaf thickness of det <dig> and wild-type plants. higher concentrations caused an increase of leaf thickness in the wild type  <cit> . in this study, leaf thickness of cpd-antisense plants and brz treated plants displayed diminished enhancement from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  in contrast, leaf thickness of cbb <dig> plants increased more during that period .figure  <dig>

leaves five and six were analysed in parallel at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  similar effects on leaf length, leaf width, and leaf thickness were observed .

reduced growth is mainly due to reduced cell size
smaller leaf size of br deficient plants could be based on impaired cell expansion, cell proliferation, or a combination of both. previous analyses of br mutants revealed effects on both cell proliferation and cell expansion. br deficient mutants such as dwf <dig>  det <dig>  <cit>  and cpd  <cit>  are characterized by reduced cell division rates and reduced cell expansion.

in this study, similar size of palisade and spongy parenchyma cells in cpd-antisense, cbb <dig>  and wild-type plants were observed at day  <dig> , suggesting that the previous br application normalized cell expansion. later on, palisade and spongy parenchyma cells of cpd-antisense and cbb <dig> plants became smaller in comparison to the wild type . similar results were obtained for younger leaves . effects on cell number were less evident. the cbb <dig> leaves exhibited a tendency towards lower cell numbers, indicating an incomplete normalization of cell division rates by the previous br treatment. in contrast, cpd-antisense plants were identical to the wild type at day  <dig> and later . application of brz to the wild type reduced cell sizes , but did not significantly reduce cell numbers .figure  <dig>

reduced starch and unchanged protein levels in br deficient plants
synthetic br stimulates co <dig> assimilation  <cit> , and cbb <dig> and cpd-antisense plants exhibit reduced photosynthetic rates  <cit> . both biochemical and morphological factors could account for reduced photosynthesis. the consequences of reduced carbon supply include reduced starch levels, impaired energy balance, reduced provision of biosynthetic precursors, and decreased growth  <cit> . in line with previous reports, starch levels were diminished in cpd-antisense, cbb <dig>  and brz treated plants from day  <dig> onwards . the reduction of starch levels in cpd-antisense and cbb <dig> plants is relatively small in comparison to previously determined levels  <cit> . this may reflect the lack of severe cellular abnormalities that were avoided by the initial br supplementation. hexose and sucrose levels were not significantly altered . examination of plastid ultrastructure revealed intact chloroplasts in br deficient plants. brz treated, cpd-antisense, and cbb <dig> chloroplasts tended to develop a thylakoid network with reduced grana stacking at day  <dig> and to a more minor extent at day  <dig> .figure  <dig>

early studies on br demonstrated that inhibitors of protein synthesis  interfere with br dependent growth  <cit> . it was suggested that br induces the synthesis of a large number of specific proteins, but does not indiscriminately increase overall protein synthesis. in agreement with that view, the overall protein content was not significantly altered in leaves of br deficient plants .

reduced tca cycle activity in brz treated plants
mitochondrial respiratory metabolism is the major source of atp and associated with proper maintenance of cellular metabolism as a whole  <cit> . the tricarboxylic acid  cycle is a crucial component of respiratory metabolism. it links the oxidation of the acetyl group of acetyl-coa to co <dig> with the generation of nadh for the oxidation by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. in plants, acetyl-coa is derived from the products of glycolysis through oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase  <cit> .

leaf discs were incubated in -glucose or -glucose. co <dig> from the c <dig> and c <dig> positions is preferentially released by the actions of pyruvate dehydrogenase or malic enzyme  <cit> . feeding with -glucose to brz treated leaves resulted in a lower evolution of 14co <dig> in comparison to the control . c <dig> of glucose is released either by an enzyme of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway , namely 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, or an enzyme of the tca cycle, isocitrate dehydrogenase  <cit> . feeding of brz treated plants with -glucose tended to result in a lower 14co <dig> evolution in comparison to mock-treated plants .figure  <dig>

the relative content of tca cycle intermediates was determined by mass spectrometry. aspartate is synthesized by transamination of oxaloacetate and can be used to estimate oxaloacetate levels. levels of several tca cycle intermediates were increased in brz treated plants . levels of citrate, malate, and aspartate were significantly different from the control . a tendency to higher levels of tca cycle intermediates was also observed in the cbb <dig> mutant . the ketoglutarate level was significantly increased at day  <dig> .figure  <dig> 
levels of tca cycle intermediates in brz treated plants. plants were grown and harvested as described in figure  <dig>  relative metabolite levels are given as mean ± se of three biological replicates. fold change values are given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 



lower co <dig> release from -glucose by the pyruvate decarboxylase and/or malic enzyme and increased levels of tca cycle intermediates suggest a weaker tca cycle activity in br deficient plants. the release of co <dig> from -glucose is furthermore consistent with a reduced flux through the tca cycle, but could also suggest a reduced activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway .

discussion
experimental approaches to study br deficiency
br deficient plants display dwarfism and multiple defects in cell elongation, cell division, cell differentiation, reproduction and senescence, and light control of development  <cit> . reduced fertility and male sterility are common features of br deficient mutants. br appears to be largely dispensable for embryogenesis  <cit> . seedling development, however, critically depends on br. hypocotyl length, cotyledon growth, and responses to environmental stimuli were impaired in arabidopsis mutants  <cit> . br deficiency impairs plant growth at early stages, and later phenotypic changes are inevitably modified by the early growth defects. thus, mutant analyses can properly address early phases in plant development, but conclusions about br function at later stages are fraught with uncertainty.

one approach to study the mode of action of br at later developmental stages is the application of inhibitors of br biosynthesis  <cit> . previous approaches usually supplemented brz  <cit>  and other azole derivatives  to synthetic growth medium, implying that seedlings or small plantlets were analysed. an alternative approach is the complementation of br deficient mutants for a limited period, and the subsequent deprivation of synthetic br. both approaches have pros and cons. for example, brz is seen as a highly specific inhibitor, but it presumably also affects other p450s. although br deficient mutants respond to synthetic br, br feeding cannot fully mimic the endogenous distribution of br.

for those reasons, both approaches were followed in the current study and analysed in parallel . the first three weeks of the experiments presumed the presence of wild-type br levels or continuous supply of synthetic br . at this point , transcript levels of br biosynthesis genes and growth were similar in the mutants and the control . increased cpd and dwf <dig> transcript levels suggest that plants became impoverished for br within one to three days .

br deficiency in established leaves impairs cell expansion
leaves grow initially mainly by cell proliferation. cells divide and grow simultaneously. a proliferation gradient develops between cell division and expansion at the transition zone. the transition from cell proliferation to expansion  is controlled by a network of factors. cell division first ceases at the tip of the leaf, and progressively ceases along the longitudinal axis  <cit> . the final size of the organ is achieved by elongation growth.

mutant analyses indicated that both cell division and cell elongation are affected by br, because leaves of br deficient mutant such as det <dig> and cpd exhibit both decreased cell size and cell numbers  <cit> . br controls the transition between cell division and expansion  <cit> . in addition, br controls organ boundary formation  <cit> , xylem formation  <cit> , and stomata development  <cit> .

we focused our analysis on established leaves at later developmental stages. at this stage , cell expansion and cell proliferation took place in leaves three to six. palisade and spongy parenchyma were significantly smaller in cpd-antisense, cbb <dig>  and brz treated plants . the cell number was slightly reduced in the cbb <dig> mutant . however, cell proliferation in cpd-antisense and brz treated plants was similar to the wild type . thus, cell expansion in established leaves depends on br, but cell division is barely impaired.

leaf thickness is determined by the mesophyll anatomy and cell size. the cellular organization of mesophyll tissues modifies the interception of light and co <dig> diffusion to the sites of photosynthesis. the effects of br or other phytohormones and stimuli on leaf thickness are not well documented, because changes in leaf growth have usually been assessed in two dimensions. in this study, induced br deficiency in brz treated and cpd-antisense plants was associated with reduced leaf thickness . in contrast, leaf thickness in cbb <dig> plants increased more until day  <dig> . the reason for the difference between the genotypes could be the incomplete normalization of cbb <dig> plants. alternatively, cbb <dig> plants could synthesize alternative br and respond in a different manner to br as has been reported for the rice brd <dig>  mutant .

reduced starch accumulation may cause reduced growth
reduced growth of br deficient plants may be a consequence of reduced carbon availability. starch levels in cbb <dig>  cpd-antisense, and brz treated leaves were lower in comparison to the wild type . this presumably is a consequence of drastically reduced co <dig> assimilation rates  <cit> . optimal starch metabolism is pivotal for the diurnal carbon balance and growth  <cit> . mutants impaired in starch synthesis such as phosphoglucomutase  or mutants impaired in starch degradation such as starch excess  <dig>  show dwarfism  <cit> . both too rapid and too slow mobilization of starch during the night can result in diminished growth rates  <cit> . thus, carbon undersupply may cause impaired growth in br deficient mutants.

electron micrographs of brz treated plants and the cbb <dig> mutant revealed a tendency to less grana thylakoids . the molecular basis of reduced thylakoid stacking is unknown. it could reflect a delay in plastid development, an altered adaptation of the thylakoid architecture to the light conditions, an altered protein composition, or changes in other regulatory mechanisms. grana confer functional advantages such as enhancement of light capture and fine-tuning of energy distribution between the photosystems  <cit> . conceivably, the observed changes in chloroplast structure contribute to the reduced photosynthetic rate and starch accumulation. plastid structure and function were previously analysed in br mutants. one reason for that interest is the link between br action and photomorphogenesis  <cit> . light-grown det <dig> plants developed structurally altered chloroplasts. for example, eight-day-old det <dig> chloroplasts had a smaller, rounder shape, reduced grana stacking, and an abnormally high ratio of chlorophyll a/b in comparison to the wild type, indicating an immature status  <cit> . however, azpiroz and coworkers  <cit>  did not describe an altered chloroplast structure of light-grown dwf <dig> plants. given the multiple reports that describe altered properties of plastids of br treated plants or br mutants , a more detailed analysis of the underlying structural and molecular changes may be worthwhile.

reduced growth is associated with reduced tca cycle activity
the tca cycle links the oxidation of pyruvate and malate with the generation of nadh. nadh is used by the mitochondrial respiratory chain for atp production. the reduced release of 14co <dig> from labelled glucose in brz treated plants  and elevated levels of tca cycle intermediates in brz treated  and cbb <dig> plants  suggest a reduced carbon flux through the tca cycle in br deficient plants. reduced tca cycle activity may compromise efficient use of carbohydrates and impair growth especially during the dark period. furthermore, the tca cycle provides precursors for various biosynthetic pathways  <cit> .

reduced production of atp for sucrose synthesis and carbon precursors for anabolism could be consequence or cause of reduced growth. br deficiency and reduced growth presumably goes along with reduced demand for carbohydrates, amino acids, and other biosynthetic precursors. on the other hand, reduced photosynthesis in br deficient plants could diminish the supply of substrates for mitochondrial reactions and reduce the flux through the tca cycle. the situation becomes even more complex in view of the multifaceted links between photosynthesis and tca cycle. altered tca cycle enzyme activities can result in increased, decreased, or unvaried photosynthesis  <cit> . thus, identification of cause and effect of metabolic changes is complicated. labelling studies and application of network models will be necessary to precisely determine the flux of metabolites and interplay of metabolic pathways in br deficient plants.

CONCLUSIONS
the morphology of br deficient mutants was described in detail. numerous studies addressed the consequences of br deficiency at the molecular and cellular level. in that way, the current understanding of br was developed. however, the analysis of br deficient mutants is complicated by the dwarfism and multiple morphological changes. the mode of action of br at later developmental stages cannot be faultlessly determined. in this study, we used two approaches for the analysis of br action in established leaves. an inhibitor of br biosynthesis was applied and br complementation of br deficient plants was stopped after three weeks. for the first time the metabolic changes upon br deficiency were analysed comprehensively by means of metabolic profiling. our analyses revealed that induced br deficiency impairs starch accumulation, tca cycle activity, cell expansion, and biomass production. further studies are needed to determine alterations in metabolic fluxes and the precise link between genomic br effects and catabolic and anabolic pathways. transgenic approaches such as the inducible expression of rnai hairpins represent another approach that would enable tissue-specific repression of br biosynthesis. this could particularly help to separate the role of br in sink and source tissues.
