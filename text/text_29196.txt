BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle development is complex, involving several signaling pathways. skeletal muscles are formed from somites, which are derived from paraxial mesoderm. somites form initially as somitomeres, and after the epithelization process, they form mesenchymal sclerotome and dermomyotome. mesodermal cells are selected to form myoblasts and subsequently differentiate into myotubes  <cit> . the molecular mechanism determining myogenesis was recently identified. the wnt protein plays crucial roles in the development of skeletal muscle. indeed, skeletal muscle is formed from paraxial mesoderm under the influence of signals from the neural tube and dorsal ectoderm, including wnt proteins and bmp <dig> signaling, and myogenic cell fate is determined by intrinsic factors, myod and myf <dig>  <cit> . the diverse wnt members function differently. for example, wnt <dig> expression preferentially activates myf <dig>  while wnt7a-expressing cells activate myod, and wnt <dig>  wnt5a and wnt <dig> can activate both myf <dig> and myod  <cit> . wnt <dig>  wnt 3a and wnt 5a induce the proliferation of satellite cells, a source of myoblasts  <cit> .

wnt <dig> over-expression in mouse myoblast-derived c2c <dig> cells induces hypertrophy of myotubes. wnt <dig> over-expression in the presumptive limb field of the chick embryo results in up-regulation of pax <dig> and myod, and increased skeletal muscle mass. wnt <dig> over-expression in c2c <dig> cells induces an increase in fast-type myosin heavy chain  expression. moreover, wnt <dig> is reported to negatively regulate myostatin  <cit> . therefore wnt <dig> is thought to possess myogenic activity.

previously, we generated a wnt4-over-expressing cell line from c2c <dig> cells, w4- <dig>  <cit> . c2c <dig> cells can differentiate into myotubes under reduced mitogen conditions, while w4- <dig> cells can spontaneously differentiate into myotubes even in proliferative conditions. we investigated the factors that specifically affect myogenic differentiation by comparing this wnt4-over-expressing cell line with its parental c2c <dig> cell line.

micrornas  are small, endogenous non-coding rnas consisting of approximately  <dig> nucleotides that regulate mrna expression by binding to complementary sequences of the mrna leading to cleavage or translational repression  <cit> . these small single strand mirnas target one or more mrnas and play important roles in cell embryogenesis, cell differentiation, carcinogenesis and apoptosis  <cit> . recently, involvement of mirnas in skeletal muscle differentiation has been indicated  <cit> .

therefore, we searched for specific mirnas that are involved in myogenic differentiation, and our mirna microarray data demonstrated two novel mirnas, mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> that are specifically down-regulated in c2c <dig> cells cultured in differentiation medium.

transfection of the mimics of these mirnas resulted in decreased expression of the myogenic markers, troponin t and myosin heavy chain , suggesting delayed myogenic differentiation. our results suggest that mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are novel muscle-specific mirnas that may function as negative regulators of skeletal muscle differentiation.

RESULTS
mirna microarray analysis
we compared the mirna expression profiles of c2c12-pr cells  vs. w4- <dig> cells  cultured in proliferation medium. w4- <dig> cells can differentiate into myotubes even in proliferative conditions. we identified  <dig> mirnas to be up-regulated, including mir- <dig>  mir-133b and mir-133a , while only mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were down-regulated by about − <dig>  in log <dig> ratio . the expression of these up- and down-regulated mirnas were also commonly altered when expression in c2c12-pr vs. c2c12-df cells  was compared;  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated with mir- <dig>  mir-133b and mir-133a being commonly up-regulated , and mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were down-regulated .  at ncbi with accession number gse <dig> )

therefore, we focused on mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b, mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as a potential myogenic differentiation-related mirnas, and the effect of transfection of these mirnas on cell differentiation was assessed.

the effect of mirna transfection on c2c <dig> differentiation
we transfected mirna mimics of the mirnas which were significantly up- or down-regulated, and effects on cellular differentiation were determined by immunocytochemistry. transfection efficacy of mirna mimics was confirmed by real time rt-pcr analysis of ptk <dig> expression following mir- <dig> positive control transfection . troponin t expression was evaluated after the transfection of the mimics followed by 3 days incubation in differentiation conditions. the troponin t expression ratio reached approximately 6% in negative controls. transfection of mir- <dig> positive control, mir- <dig> and mir-133a resulted in a significant increase of the troponin t-positive cell ratio, while transfection of mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mimics significantly decreased troponin t expression .figure  <dig> troponin t expression, 3 days after transfection and medium change. compared with the mir negative control , transfection of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and 133a resulted in a significantly higher troponin t positive ratio, while mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> transfectants gave a significantly lower ratio. scale bar 50 μm. nc: negative control.



cellular differentiation was also assessed by determining levels of fast and slow type myhcs. immunocytochemistry for myhcs was performed after transfection followed by 1 week of incubation in differentiation medium. transfection of mir-487b and mir- <dig> mimics resulted in a significant decrease in the myhc  positive ratio , while mir- <dig> positive control, mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b and mir- <dig> did not affect the myhc  positive cell ratio. mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mimics significantly decreased the myhc  positive cell ratio .figure  <dig> mir-487b and mir- <dig> transfection down-regulated fast type myhc. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b, mir- <dig> did not affect myhc expression. scale bar 50 μm. nc: negative control.



mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> significantly suppress expression of troponin t
next, we focused on mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> transfection, which resulted in decreased differentiation. we confirmed that the expression of these mirnas was significantly decreased in differentiation conditions by rt-qpcr . the expression of these three mirnas was significantly down-regulated in c2c <dig> cells cultured in differentiation medium, compared with cells cultured in proliferation medium. the mimics of these mirnas were transfected in c2c <dig> cells. to confirm when the reduction of troponin t expression begins, its expression was assessed on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after transfection. the troponin t expression ratio increased on each day in all groups, and transfection of mirna mimics suppressed its expression significantly . the suppression of troponin t expression was observed from day  <dig> for mir-487b and mir- <dig>  and from day  <dig> for mir- <dig>  next, to address the possibility that these mirnas might suppress an earlier myogenic differentiation stage, we assessed the expression of myogenic transcription factors, myod and myogenin.figure  <dig> troponin t expression from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after transfection and medium change. troponin t expression increased on successive days. the mirna mimic transfection group showed a lower troponin t expression ratio. mir-487b and mir- <dig> transfection resulted in significantly lower troponin t expression from day  <dig>  scale bar 50 μm. nc: negative control.



mirna mimic transfection and myod and myogenin expression in c2c <dig> cell
myod expression was assessed on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after transfection. myod and myogenin expression was observed from day 1– <dig> in the nucleus. a positive reaction in the nucleus is presented as the ratio of cells showing a positive nuclear reaction. the nuclear expression ratio of myod showed varied scores, but there was no significant difference among mir negative control and mirna mimic transfection groups . the myogenin nuclear expression ratio increased on each day, but transfection of mirna mimics did not significantly affect its expression pattern . we do not think that myod and myogenin cellular localization is altered by transfection of mirna mimics because we confirmed that the expression patterns of these molecules in non-transfected c2c <dig> cells were similar to those of the mirna transfection group .figure  <dig> myod expression in mirna transfectants from day  <dig> to day  <dig> after transfection and medium change. the nuclear staining pattern is shown . myod expression was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. scale bar 50 μm. myod nuclear staining was counted and is presented in the bar graph. there were no significant differences in myod nuclear positive ratios. nc: negative control.



skeletal muscle differentiation is a multistep pathway in which several signaling molecules are implicated. in particular, wnt signaling plays important roles in myogenic commitment and differentiation. the formation of skeletal muscle from paraxial mesoderm is influenced by signals from the neural tube and dorsal ectoderm, including wnt <dig> and bmp <dig>  <cit> . and in adult skeletal muscle, several wnt members including wnt <dig>  wnt <dig>  wnt5a and wnt7a are required for proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells during myotube turnover  <cit> . previously we established the w4- <dig> cell line, which stably over-expresses wnt <dig> and spontaneously differentiates into myotubes even in mitogen rich medium. comparison of gene expression profiles between w4- <dig> cells and its parental cell line, c2c <dig>  may be informative for the understanding of myogenesis-related molecules. recently, involvement of mirnas in skeletal muscle differentiation has been debated. for example, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  <cit>  are known as muscle-specific mirnas. additionally, mir-23a  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-27a  <cit> , mir-27b  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-128a  <cit> , mir-146b  <cit> , mir-148a  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-221/ <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit>  and mir- <dig>  <cit>  are reported to be involved in skeletal myogenesis. mirnas can either inhibit or promote myogenesis, depending on their target mrnas.

we found that mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b were up-regulated, and mir-487b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were down-regulated during myogenic differentiation. consistent with our previous report, transfection of mir- <dig>  and mir-133a resulted in significantly higher troponin t expression. however, mir- <dig>  133a and 133b did not affect the expression of slow type or fast type myhc. we used mir- <dig> as a positive control, which was as assayed by the down-regulation of the ptk <dig> target gene . transfection of mir- <dig> also showed significantly higher troponin t expression because mir- <dig> also regulates proliferation and differentiation of myoblast cells by targeting the transcription of hdac <dig>  <cit> . however, these mirnas, which were significantly up-regulated in w4- <dig> cells, did not affect slow type or fast type myhc, suggesting that these mirnas are not significantly associated with the late muscle differentiation step.

in this study, we identified mir-486b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as novel myogenic differentiation-related mirnas, the functions of which are largely unknown. transfection of these mirnas resulted in reduced expression of myogenic differentiation markers, particularly in the late myogenic differentiation stage. however, involvement of these mirnas in myogenic commitment or differentiation has not been reported. moreover, no reports have been published on the function of mir- <dig> or mir- <dig>  some reports suggested that mir-487b is associated with several kinds of pathological condition. mir-487b is commonly and severely down-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines, suggesting that mir-487b may function as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion  <cit> . furthermore, mir-487b expression is significantly associated with disease-free survival of non-mycn-amplified favorable neuroblastoma  <cit> . mir-487b also promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma cell  <cit> , while several other reports imply roles of mir-487b in cellular proliferation. mir-487b is predicted to target insulin receptor-like substrate, down-regulation of which may impair skeletal muscle growth  <cit> . xi et al reported that mir-487b directly targets wnt5a  <cit> , which is important in proliferation of satellite cells in adult skeletal muscle.

we also sought the target of these novel myogenic differentiation-related mirnas using a bioinformatics approach. the candidate target for mir-487b varied greatly depending on the database queried and it was difficult to determine a commonly suggested target. however, according to micrornaseq , mir-487b directly targets several molecules that are involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, including wnt <dig>  wnt5a, troponin t type  <dig>  , myosin, heavy chain  <dig>  skeletal muscle, adult , myosin, heavy chain  <dig>  skeletal muscle, adult , myosin, heavy chain  <dig>  skeletal muscle, embryonic  and myosin, heavy chain  <dig>  skeletal muscle . however, we were unable to identify candidate targets associated with muscle differentiation for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> 

these data indicate that these newly identified mirnas may directly and/or indirectly suppress skeletal muscle differentiation and maturation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> as new skeletal muscle differentiation-associated mirnas. transfection of mimics of these mirnas resulted in reduced expression in troponin t and myhc, but did not affect the expression of myod or myogenin. these mirnas may delay skeletal muscle differentiation by suppressing myotube differentiation and maturation markers. further investigation is warranted to identify the targets of these mirnas and the detailed mechanism by which they inhibit skeletal muscle maturation.
