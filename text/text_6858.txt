BACKGROUND
polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism in several taxa, both as a remote mechanism involving ancient genome duplications followed by extensive genetic reshufflings
 <cit>  and as a proximal cause of evolution  as, for example, in flowering plants
 <cit>  and, to a lesser extent, in animals
 <cit> . polyploids are often reproductively isolated from their diploid ancestors, as hybrids are anortoploid, producing unbalanced gametes at meiosis
 <cit> . various polyploidization events occurred in the remote past in vertebrates
 <cit> , and polyploidy has also been demonstrated among invertebrates, often in combination with parthenogenesis or other forms of asexual reproduction
 <cit> , thus promoting speciation. among annelids, polyploidy is widely present in oligochaetous clitellates, with substantial differences within families
 <cit> .

tubifex tubifex  is a cosmopolitan naidid annelid sensu <cit>  representing one of the major components of the benthic fauna in freshwater communities
 <cit> . also present in polluted waters, t. tubifex is widely used in laboratories for ecotoxicology research
 <cit>  and as a model organism for the study of annelid development
 <cit> . tubifex tubifex is characterized by considerable variability in its morphological features
 <cit>  and by a mixed reproductive strategy, with parthenogenesis
 <cit> , self-fertilization
 <cit> , and biparental reproduction through cross-mating
 <cit> . in a molecular phylogenetic analysis of several t. tubifex and t. blanchardi specimens from the lambro river  based on a fragment of the 16s rrna mitochondrial gene, we characterized t. blanchardi, traditionally considered a t. tubifex "morphotype"
 <cit> , and confirmed its status as a distinct species by an in-depth molecular and morphological analysis
 <cit> . moreover we detected considerable genetic variability among the "t. tubifex" specimens analyzed, and we suggest that these specimens may represent at least two cryptic species
 <cit> . this study is in continuity with our previous work; thus, here, we use the same clade and lineage attributions.

 there are no cytogenetic data for t. blanchardi and few scattered records of t. tubifex due to the small size and large number of their chromosomes. the available cytogenetic data suggest that the observed morphological and molecular heterogeneity of t. tubifex is mirrored by numerous karyotypic differences
 <cit> . indeed, the different chromosome numbers proposed for t. tubifex  might reflect different levels of ploidy within populations
 <cit> . in agreement with these data, the presence of tetra- and hexaploid individuals among the t. tubifex inhabiting the lambro river has been postulated
 <cit>  based on an analysis of the allozymes phosphoglucose isomerase  and phosphoglucose mutase . 

the aim of this study was to investigate polyploidy in sympatric tubifex lineages coupling cytogenetics with molecular phylogenetics, and discuss how multiple polyploidyzation events, possibly enhanced by parthenogenesis, might have shaped the evolution of this species complex.

RESULTS
molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis
seven indels,  <dig> variable sites , and the empirical base frequencies πa =  <dig> , πc =  <dig> , πg =  <dig> , and πt =  <dig>  were identified in the mitochondrial 16s-rrna gene alignment of the screened t. tubifex and t. blanchardi embryos, among which  <dig> haplotypes were identified.

sequences were compared to the known t. tubifex and t. blanchardi haplotypes from the lambro river . building on a previously published analysis
 <cit> , seven new haplotypes were identified, but none corresponded to a potentially new genetic lineage and/or clade. some of the material used by
 <cit>  has been recently reanalyzed , thus allowing for the attribution of two of the haplotypes formerly assigned to the t. tubifex species complex  to another oligochaetous clitellate species, potamotrix bavaricus .

within and between clades and lineages, the average uncorrected divergences at the 16s rrna gene, summarized in tables 
 <dig> and
 <dig>  were similar to those already published in
 <cit> . clades  <dig> and  <dig> showed a within-clade average uncorrected divergence  of approximately 5% . the genetic distances between t. blanchardi and the other two clades were striking, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %; by contrast, the genetic divergence between lineages of the same clade was low . a very low within-lineage genetic divergence  characterized the t. tubifex lineages .

cytogenetic analysis
chromosome-number distribution
based on the analysis of more than  <dig> metaphase plates, t. blanchardi showed a unimodal distribution, with a modal chromosome number of  <dig>  the chromosome-number distribution of the t. tubifex, based on the analysis of more than  <dig> metaphase plates, showed a trimodal pattern, with a primary mode of  <dig> chromosomes and secondary and tertiary modes of  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes, respectively .

karyotype reconstruction
the giemsa-stained metaphase plates of t. blanchardi and t. tubifex were selected on the basis of spreading quality to minimize the number of artifacts due to loss or gain of single chromosomes. the chromosomes were aligned by decreasing size; on the basis of centromere position, they were classified as meta and submetacentric chromosomes or acrocentric chromosomes. it was not possible to reconstruct the karyotype of the rare t. tubifex lineage 2d due to the poor quality of the few metaphases observed. the size and relative number of meta- submeta- and acrocentric chromosomes for the representative karyotypes of the various lineages are summarized in figure 
 <dig>  one, two and four metacentric chromosomes significantly larger than the others were found in the metaphase plates of lineages 2b , 2c , 3a and 3b .

in-situ hybridization
due to the large number and small size of the t. tubifex and t. blanchardi chromosomes, it was impossible to finely localize the 18s rdna signals on specific chromosomes; we therefore simply counted the number of hybridization signals in each metaphase plate. all the analyzed metaphase plates from t. blanchardi showed two hybridization signals , while t. tubifex lineage 2a  showed three hybridization signals ; lineages 2b, 2d, 3a and 3b , showed four hybridization signals ; and lineage 2c  showed six hybridization signals .

discussion
the karyotype of tubifex blanchardi, assessed here for the first time, differed from that of the other sympatric t. tubifex lineages, thus corroborating its status as a distinct species, as proposed by
 <cit> . the observed chromosome numbers and size distribution were consistent with the presence of at least six sympatric euploid chromosome complements, corresponding to one diploid , one triploid , three tetraploids  and one hexaploid  t. tubifex populations. all  <dig> analyzed t. tubifex from estonia were hexaploid  and grouped into lineage 2c, with other individuals from the lambro river. the numbers of hybridization signals we observed in t. blanchardi and in the various t. tubifex lineages were consistent with the ploidy levels inferred from the analysis of the chromosome number distribution. the presence of large metacentric chromosomes proportionate in number to the ploidy level, as proposed by
 <cit> , has been verified only for the tetraploid t. tubifex belonging to clade  <dig>  which have four large metacentric chromosomes. only one large metacentric chromosome was observed in the tetraploid lineage 2b, and two large metacentric chromosomes were observed in the hexaploid lineage 2c . the large metacentric chromosomes might be derived from centric fusions of acrocentric chromosomes , as already reported in other families of oligochaetous clitellates . by mapping the t. tubifex and t. blanchardi karyotypes on the phylogenetic tree, we identified at least two t. tubifex clades: the two tetraploid populations of clade  <dig> and the tri-, tetra-, and hexaploid populations that form the well supported clade  <dig>  the t. tubifex of clades  <dig> and  <dig> are characterized by a high interclade genetic divergence  suggesting the existence of a genetic barrier to gene flow
 <cit> , and should be considered distinct cryptic species. the different polyploid populations forming clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> may be considered polyploid forms of the same species  or distinct cryptic species. intriguingly, the intraclade genetic divergence among 16s rrna genes ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> % , a value comparable to the genetic divergence observed between polyploid populations of plants recognized as true polyploid species
 <cit> . although a formal description of these lineages falls outside the aims of this study, we stress that it was not possible to identify any consistent morphological difference between clades  <dig> and  <dig>  or between the different identified lineages
 <cit> . the morphological characteristics traditionally used for identification in this group allowed for the identification and characterization only of t. blanchardi <cit> ; however, following an integrative taxonomic approach
 <cit> , the genetic complements of the various lineages , their independent evolutionary histories and, perhaps, their ecological features suggested by
 <cit> , might be considered good taxonomic markers to be used for a formal description of these independent lineages.

evolution of the tubifex species from the lambro river
the six euploid sets that we observed in the mixed lambro community were coherently arranged in the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree, each lineage grouping specimens with the same chromosome complement . no lineages of mixed ploidy were observed, and each polyploid was represented by one or few mitochondrial haplotypes , as is common in parthenogenetic polyploid species
 <cit> . parthenogenesis may have played a key role in the evolution of polyploidy in t. tubifex and t. blanchardi, as in other clitellates
 <cit>  and in many animal groups
 <cit> . this pattern, together with the pattern of hybridization signals, suggests that multiple polyploidyzation events  may have played a driving role in maintaining independently evolving species and in shaping the evolution of the lambro t. tubifex and t. blanchardi species.

two main hypotheses concerning chromosomal evolution are compatible with our phylogenetic analysis. in the first scenario, a diploid  common ancestor may have given rise to clades 1 +  <dig> and  <dig> through two independent polyploidyzation events. indeed, the tetraploid t. tubifex belonging to clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig> differ in their karyotypes, respectively showing none, one and four large metacentric chromosomes and different proportions of meta-, submeta- and acrocentric chromosomes . following this hypothesis, t. blanchardi retained the plesiomorphic diploid state of  <dig> chromosomes
 <cit> . the alternative scenario, which is more likely according to our ancestral state reconstruction analysis, suggests that the ancestor of clades 1 +  <dig> and  <dig> was instead tetraploid . clade  <dig> may have arisen directly from this tetraploid ancestor, which probably had a similar karyotype, with four large metacentric chromosomes . by contrast, the diploid t. blanchardi  and the tetraploid t. tubifex  evolved from a new tetraploid ancestor, characterized by a proportion of large metacentric chromosomes different from that seen in the ancestral population . following this hypothesis, the diploid t. blanchardi  may have originated from a tetraploid secondarily, possibly by parthenogenetic development of its eggs . the triploid  and hexaploid t. tubifex lineages  might have originated from this tetraploid ancestor from the union of a haploid and an unreduced gamete or through hybridization among cryptic species.

polyploid species generally have greater metabolic flexibility and are characterized by an ecological tolerance higher than that of their diploid ancestors . although controversial, an example of environmental tolerance acquired via polyploidy concerns artemia parthenogenetica, the polyploid populations of which are more likely to survive in polluted habitats, at suboptimal values of temperature and salinity or in the presence of elevated concentrations of cadmium, than their diploid ancestors
 <cit> . although several studies have demonstrated that different genetic lineages of t. tubifex have different habitat preferences and resistance to pollutants , no direct effect of ploidy on pollution resistance has been suggested.
 <cit>  showed that t. tubifex individuals belonging to different mitochondrial lineages varied consistently in cadmium resistance. intriguingly, when the t. tubifex 16s rrna gene sequences from
 <cit>  corresponding to the lineages with different levels of cadmium resistance were mapped against our phylogeny, they grouped on the phylogenetic tree in a predictable manner. indeed, all the sequences belonging to lineages i, ii, iii, iv and v sensu <cit>  grouped with the triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid t. tubifex respectively belonging to lineages 3a, 2a, 2b, 2d and 2c of the lambro river, excluding sequence d6-u <dig> . the cadmium-resistant lineages  corresponded to tetraploid lineages 3a and 2b, and the less cadmium-resistant of the two  corresponded to the triploid t. tubifex lineage 2a . the differences in ploidy in t. tubifex may thus help to explain the differences in ecological tolerance, although this analysis must be investigated further. similarly, the strong connection between mitochondrial lineages and ploidy levels can be extended to tubifex specimens from other regions worldwide.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we propose alternative hypotheses for the evolution of the independent sympatric t. tubifex and t. blanchardi lineages, analyzing the chromosome-number distribution and karyotypes in relation to their phylogenetic relationships. combining molecular phylogenetics and cytogenetics, we have found evidence for the existence of six different euploid chromosome sets coherently arranged in the tubifex mitochondrial phylogeny, each lineage grouping specimens that share the same chromosome complement. our results, including a fish assay, suggest that our population comprise diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid sympatric individuals, and that the process of polyploidization, possibly enhanced by parthenogenesis, may have played an important role in both speciation and in the evolution of t. tubifex genetic lineages characterized by different resistance to pollutants. in the future, controlled breeding experiments should be performed with the different t. tubifex lineages to observe parthenogenesis and thus shed light on the reproductive strategies adopted by the different tubifex lineages. moreover, a phylogeny based on independent nuclear markers should allow us to understand if parthenogenesis and polyploidy are associated to interspecific hybridization.
