BACKGROUND
a group of oral streptococci which is closely related to the primary cariogenic dental pathogen streptococcus mutans is referred to as "mutans streptococci", and it includes in addition to s. mutans also s. ratti, and s. sobrinus among others. a common feature of the mutans streptococci is their ability to metabolize carbohydrates present in our daily diet to produce energy for their survival and to produce organic acids which erode and dematerialize the tooth enamel and dentin. these oral bacteria are able to grow in a community and colonize the oral environment by attaching to the tooth surfaces and forming biofilms. they can also tolerate and adapt to the harsh and rapidly changing physiological conditions of the oral cavity such as extreme acidity, fluctuation of nutrients, reactive oxygen species, and other environmental stresses  <cit> . they occasionally also cause bacteremia and infective endocarditis  <cit> . all together, the survival and adaptation of mutans streptococci is directly linked to their virulence and pathogenicity.

bacterial two-component signal transduction systems  play important roles for many bacteria by enabling them to detect and respond to diverse changes/stresses in the environment. the conspicuous absence of tcs proteins in mammalian genomes makes them interesting potential targets for the development of novel anti-bacterial drugs. a bacterial two-component system comprises in general a transmembrane sensor histidine kinase  and a corresponding cytoplasmic response regulator  encoded by genes located adjacently within the same operon, although stand-alone genes coding for hks or rrs  have also been reported. in some cases, a hk and a rr are found to be merged in the same polypeptide, giving rise to a so called 'hybrid' hk protein. a hk protein is autophosphorylated at its conserved histidine  residue upon the recognition of a specific environmental stimulus. the phosphoryl group is then transferred to the aspartate  residue of the corresponding response regulator  <cit> . while hks in general serve to detect signals, the most common function of the rrs is to bind directly to dna and thereby modulating the expression of a certain set of genes which are necessary for mounting a physiological response to the perceived signals  <cit> . hk and rr proteins are composed of domains which are structurally and functionally conserved and can be used for their classification.

with the advance of large scale sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, it has become possible to computationally predict the putative functions of genes/proteins from the whole genome of an organism. the prediction of tcs proteins using a whole genome-based computational approach has been carried out for different organisms. such in silico studies have broadened our understanding of genomic repertoires essential for the growth and adjustment of the organisms to altering environmental challenges  <cit> . the genome sequencing and annotation of the first s. mutans strain  has paved the way for researchers to carry out numerous molecular biological and functional genomic studies that help in understanding the robustness, genetic specificity and complexity of this bacterium as an oral pathogen  <cit> .  <dig> tcs clusters have previously been identified in s. mutans ua <dig>  <cit>  and many of them have been reported to be involved in its virulence, adaptation and survival  <cit> . after the sequencing of six s. mutans isolates, namely s. mutans  <dig> dc <dig>  kk <dig>  kk <dig>  ac <dig>  atcc <dig> and nctc <dig>  as well as s. ratti dsm <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  we performed a systematic identification and classification of putative tcs proteins in the genomes of these eight mutans streptococci strains, using the well annotated genome of s. mutans ua <dig>  as well as that of s. mutans nn <dig>  as references. furthermore, we conducted a thorough comparative analysis of the identified tcs proteins among these strains which provides valuable insights into the conservation and divergence of tcs proteins in the mutans streptococci strains studied here. pcr experiments have been carried out to verify the presence of several predicted tcs genes of particular interest.

RESULTS
identification of tcs proteins of the mutans streptococci strains
we have sequenced the genomes of eight mutans streptococci strains  using the solexa sequencing technology . the "high-quality draft" genomes obtained according to the definition by chain et al.  <cit>  have an overall genome coverage of > 99%, taking s. mutans nn <dig> and ua <dig> as references. by combining the hidden markov model  profiling results and the information on putative operon organization, repertoires of potential tcs proteins  in the eight newly sequenced mutans streptococci strains were obtained, as shown in table  <dig> in comparison to s. mutans nn <dig> and ua <dig>  the total numbers of tcs proteins identified are comparable among the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains.

the species identities were determined by appliying biochemical testing  together with complete 16s rrna gene sequencing.

results are presented in comparison to s. mutans ua <dig> and nn <dig> as two reference strains. hks and rrs are classified based on homology box analysis and output domain architecture, respectively. hpk <dig>  hpk <dig>  hpk <dig>  hpk <dig>  hpk <dig> represent hk families as found in the classification by grebe et al.  <cit> .

by analyzing the putative operon organizations of genes encoding the identified tcs proteins  <dig> % of the total putative hks and  <dig> % of the total putative rr were found to constitute hk-rr pairs. ortholog analysis of the paired or non-paired tcs proteins among the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains revealed a total of  <dig> different tcs clusters,  <dig> orphan hks and  <dig> orphan rrs . the numbering of the tcs clusters was based on an existing numbering system used by levesque  <cit> , and extended to the new tcs clusters identified in this study. co-evolution of tcs proteins could be clearly observed. this means, hks and rrs which belong to a particular tcs cluster are usually co-present or co-absent in a specific strain. in addition, putative alleles/orthologs of the corresponding hks and rrs were found to be highly conserved  among the s. mutans strains. but across the species the conservation was clearly lower. furthermore, it is obvious that, in most cases, putative hk alleles/orthologs within one tcs cluster exhibited a higher degree of diversity than the corresponding putative rr alleles/orthologs across the species. this could be attributed to the high variability of sensing/input domains harbored by the individual hks, as will be discussed later in the classification of hks and rrs. a clear clustering of putative hk and rr alleles/orthologs can be visualized in the phylogenetic trees shown in figure  <dig>  which additionally illustrates the relationships between the different tcs clusters.

hks are classified by two different approaches based on the homology-box analysis  and the topology feature analysis , respectively; rrs are classified based on the structure of their output domains .

eight of the  <dig> tcs clusters  were common to all the strains. six clusters  were observed to be absent in one or several strains. an interesting observation was that s. ratti dsm <dig> lacked any homologs of the sensor histidine kinase and the cognate response regulator of tcs- <dig> . on the other hand, tcs- <dig>  tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> were found to be unique to s. ratti dsm <dig>  tcs- <dig>  a putative ortholog of a quorum sensing-related tcs cluster well studied in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus subtilis, was uniquely identified in s. mutans nctc <dig>  a serotype f blood isolate.

two orphan hks were identified as uniquely present in s. ratti dsm <dig>  and s. sobrinus dsm <dig> , respectively. in contrast, an orphan rr  was found to be common to all the  <dig> strains. s. sobrinus dsm <dig> harbored an additional unique orphan rr .

no hybrid hks could be detected in all the genomes of the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains compared in this study. also, the more complex variant of the two-component system, known as the phosphor-relay system comprised of an autophosphorylatable hybrid hk, one or more histidine phosphotransferases  and a terminal rr was totally absent, because no hpt domains were found in these strains.

classification of the histidine kinases
hks are multi-domain homodimeric proteins consisting of a more variable n-terminal for recognition of diverse signals from different cellular localizations  and a more conserved c-terminal containing the conserved histidine residue for signal transduction to its corresponding rr protein. the n-terminal regions of most hks are characterized by the presence of one to several  transmembrane helices , whereas the c-terminal region harbors characteristic domain profiles such as hatpase_c and his_kinase domains  <cit> . in addition, hk proteins exhibit characteristic sequence motifs , including the h-, n-, d-, f- and g- boxes, as a result of the conservation of the histidine , aspargine , aspartate , phenylalanine  and glycine  residues at fixed positions. in addition to the h-box, which contains the autophosphorylatable histidine residue functionally essential for a histidine kinase, other homology boxes are also presumed to play crucial roles in different biological processes. for example, the d-box is suggested to be responsible for dna binding and the g-box is believed to be involved in phosphotransfer reactions. homology boxes have been used to define various hk families  <cit> . thus, to better understand the functions of individual hk proteins of the mutans streptococci strains, two classification approaches were applied in this study to the putative hk proteins. the first approach termed here as homology box analysis was based on the conserved sequence motifs described before by grebe et al.  <cit> . this classification scheme sorts hk proteins into  <dig> different families  depending on the sequence motifs of the various homology boxes identified by multi-alignment. thus, members of the different families can be distinguished by conserved patterns in each of the homology boxes. the second approach termed here as domain architecture analysis was based on the classification scheme proposed by mascher et al.  <cit> , which considers the conservation of domain architecture of an entire hk, such as transmembrane helices, linker regions, sensing domains and transmitter domains. this classification method is especially helpful in understanding the signal sensing mechanisms of hks.

classification of hks based on homology box analysis
five hk families  were recognized among the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains. for each of the  <dig> strains the distributions of their hks within these families are highlighted in table  <dig> and visualized in figure  <dig> by multiple-sequence alignments of the hk proteins. it is clear that the amino acid residues surrounding the conserved histidine residue in the h-box are more conserved compared to those flanking the aspargine, aspartate, phenylalanine and glycine residues in the n-, d-, f-, and g-boxes, respectively.

the assignment of hks of all the  <dig> tcs clusters to the homology box-based hk families is given in table  <dig>  hks of tcs- <dig> to tcs- <dig>  tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> and the orphan hk of s. ratti dsm <dig>  were grouped into the hpk <dig> family, accounting for more than 50% of the total hks identified. hpk <dig> family has been known as the most common type among the histidine kinase families, characterized by highly conserved aspartate/glutamate, lysine/arginine and proline residues downstream of the conserved histidine residue in the h-boxes . the orphan hk <dig> might be a 'dead' gene because of the lack of a sensing domain, which can be inferred from the relatively short n-terminal region prior to the h-box, as highlighted in figure  <dig>  moreover,  <dig> residues including the most important histidine residue in the h-box were also found to be missing in orphan hk <dig> 

the second most abundant hk family was the hpk <dig> family, which contained more than 20% of all the hks identified and included hks of  <dig> different tcs clusters, namely tcs- <dig>  tcs- <dig>  tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the most prominent feature of this hk family was the conservation of negatively charged aspartate residue downstream of the histidine residue and the positively charged arginine residue upstream of the histidine residue in the h-box.

two other hk families found were the hpk <dig> and the hpk <dig> families. the hpk <dig> family comprised only hks of the tcs- <dig> cluster. known as lyts in s. mutans ua <dig>  hks of this family were highly conserved across all the  <dig> strains, as evidenced by the highly conserved sequence patterns of the h- and n-boxes . the identification of hks belonging to the hpk <dig> family was made possible by aligning the corresponding hks of the mutans streptococci strains of this study with their blastp homologs. this enabled the unambiguous verification of the conservation of homology boxes characteristic of the hpk <dig> family. the hpk <dig> family has been reported to include kinases that regulate competence for genetic transformation in streptococcus spp.  <cit> . indeed, hks of tcs- <dig>  fell within this family. this family was characterized by the presence of a tyrosine located two residues downstream of the conserved histidine residue, the absence of the h-box proline and the lack of the d and f-boxes. hk of tcs- <dig>  was absent in s. ratti dsm <dig>  which lacked any orthologs of both comd and its cognate response regulator come.

the last hk family identified is the hpk <dig> family containing only one histidine kinase uniquely found in s. ratti dsm <dig>  a similar strategy as that used for the classification of hks of the hpk <dig> family was performed by using blastp homologs to recognize conserved homology boxes. the h-box of this family was quite distinct from the h-boxes of other families in that the conserved histidine was flanked at its left by another histidine residue, in addition to the downstream arginine  and asparagine  residues characteristic of this family .

the hk of tcs- <dig> and the unique orphan hk of the strain s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  could not be classified into any of the  <dig> hk families.

classification of hks based on domain architecture analysis
the homology boxes-based classification of hks described above focused solely on the conserved sequence motifs in the c-terminal transmitter domains of histidine kinases. since the biological function of tcs-mediated signal transduction manifests itself in signal input and output rather than in the communication between its two components, it is necessary to characterize the n-terminal sensory regions with respect to the signal sensing mechanism of a particular hk protein. to this end, the classification method proposed by mascher et al.  <cit>  was applied to group the putative hks into three different groups: extracytoplasmic-sensing hks, cytoplasmic-sensing hks, and membrane-sensing hks , as shown in figure  <dig> 

extracytoplasmic sensing hks represent the largest group of membrane-bound sensor kinases. among all the hks identified, hks of tcs- <dig> to tcs- <dig> as well as tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> were recognized as extracytoplasmic sensing hks by displaying at the n-terminal region an extracytoplasmic putative signal perception domain composed of 110- <dig> amino acids, which were flanked by  two transmembrane helices . the cytoplasmic part of the hk proteins harboring the transmitter domain comprised either a hiska-hatpase_c domain  or a hamp-hiska-hatpase_c domain . hiska and hatpase_c are domains essential for the functionality of a histidine kinase. hamp functions as a linker to bridge the transmembrane helix and the transmitter domain  <cit> . it should be noticed that sequence regions containing about  <dig> residues were found to exist between the tm region and the hiska domain of the tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> hks. we suspect that these hks could possibly contain unknown linker domains within this region which cannot be identified due to the currently limited knowledge on hk linker domains.

cytoplasmic-sensing hks include either membrane-anchored or soluble proteins with their sensing domains located inside the cytoplasm  <cit> . only hks of three tcs clusters, namely the membrane anchored hk of tcs- <dig> and the soluble hks of tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig>  were identified as hks with putative cytoplasmic sensing functions. a more detailed look at the hks of tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> showed that they were predicted to be completely intracellular proteins. the hk of tcs- <dig>  known as vick in s. mutans ua <dig>  is typified by the presence of only one membrane-anchoring transmembrane helix and a very short extracytoplasmic linker containing  <dig> amino acids in the n-terminal region. in addition, both hks of tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> possess a pas domain. pas domains are known to play important roles as sensory modules for sensing oxygen tension, cellular redox state, or light intensity  <cit> . pas domain-containing proteins have been reported to be involved in oxidative stress response  <cit> , competence  <cit> , virulence  <cit>  and biofilm formation  <cit>  in many organisms. most pas domain-containing proteins are intracellularly located with dual functions of monitoring both the external and internal environments by perceiving alterations in the electron transport system caused by intracellular or extracellular changes in redox potential  <cit> . it has been reported that pas domains are often associated with pac domains and they are directly linked and together form the conserved 3d pas fold  <cit> , as also exemplified by the hk of tcs- <dig> in this study. in fact, in agreement with the function of the pas-pac domains, the hk of tcs- <dig>  vick, has been reported to play a role in oxidative stress response  <cit> . on the other hand, the hk of tcs- <dig> did not contain a pac motif but a gaf domain, which has been found to be present in combination with multiple domains in many phytochromes and cgmp-specific phosphoesterases  <cit> . a large variety of bacterial proteins such as those involved in signal transduction, cell autolysis, chemotaxis, glucose metabolism, nitrogen fixation, and gene regulation, as well as phototransducing proteins in plant and archea were found to contain a gaf domain  <cit> .

the highly diverse group of hks with sensing mechanisms linked to transmembrane regions  is marked by the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> transmembrane helices implicated in signal perception. such hks lack a recognizable extracellular input domain. signal sensing is either membrane associated or occurs directly within the membrane interface  <cit> . although it has been suggested that this group represents the smallest group of membrane-bound sensor histidine kinases when compared to other hk families in the smart database  <cit> , hks of tcs- <dig> to tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> in this study were all found to belong to this group, indicating that a relatively high percentage of hks of the mutans streptococci strains are involved in sensing signals directly associated with the membrane. such signals can be changes in the mechanical properties of the cell envelope, signals derived from membrane-bound enzymes or other membrane-integral components, ions, electrochemical gradients, transport processes, or the presence of compounds that affect cell envelope integrity  <cit> . most quorum sensing hks from gram-positive bacteria fall into this category, like comd, the hk of tcs- <dig>  putative alleles/orthologs of comd were found in most of the mutans streptococci strains of this study, characterized by  <dig> to  <dig> transmembrane helices in the n-terminal region succeeded by a transmitter region containing only the hatpase_c domain. in s. sobrinus dsm <dig> the unique orphan hk <dig>  was also assigned to this group. orphan hk <dig> shared a sequence similarity of about 37% with the hk  of tcs- <dig>  which is the predicted ortholog of comd in s. sobrinus dsm <dig> 

for the highly diverse membrane-sensing hk family, six subfamilies have been additionally defined based on features such as the number of tm helices, the type and sequential arrangement of sensory domains, the length of the inter-helix linker regions and the presence or absence of extracytoplasmic linker regions  <cit> . by applying this grouping scheme, the membrane-sensing hks of tcs- <dig>  tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> were grouped into subgroup . this subgroup is comprised of small sensor kinases containing  <dig> tm helices and lacking significant extracytoplasmic regions. hks of this subgroup are involved in sensing cell envelope stress or mediating abc transporter-coupled detoxification processes in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . hks of tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> were assigned to subgroup , which is primarily comprised of quorum-sensing hks of gram-positive bacteria possessing  <dig> to  <dig> tm helices. hks of tcs- <dig> and the orphan hk <dig> were grouped into subgroup  represented by desk-like thermo sensors with  <dig> or  <dig> tm helices that sense membrane fluidity. hks of tcs- <dig> and tcs- <dig> were assigned to subgroup  with a conserved but yet functionally unknown input domains containing  <dig> to  <dig> tm helices.

classification of the response regulators
a rr protein, most commonly a transcription factor  <cit> , comprises an n-terminal regulatory domain  and a c-terminal effector domain . the phosphorylated aspartate residue falls within the receiver domain whose structure is well conserved as represented by the response_reg domain among almost all the known rrs  <cit> . phosphorylation of the aspartate residue activates the dna binding properties of the output domain, ultimately resulting in the direct or indirect activation or repression of a set of genes. the output domains are less conserved and differ according to the nature of the signal outputs. hence, a classification of rrs based on the domain architecture of the c-terminal effector domain should provide insight into the specific biological function of the tcss  <cit> . despite the great variety of output domains and domain combinations, about 60% of all known response regulators belong to the ompr, narl or ntrc families, and all of which contain a helix-turn-helix  dna-binding output domain. rrs with the dna-binding output domains lyttr, arac, spo0a, fis, ycbb, rpoe, and merr account for an additional 6%  <cit> . the rest of the rrs are characterized by the presence of a stand-alone rec domain  or combinations  comprising a variety of enzymatic domains, rna-binding domains, protein or ligand-binding domains, or other newly described domains of unknown functions. the diversity of the domain architectures and the abundance of domain combinations of the output domain allow bacterial cells to regulate a variety of biological processes such as transcription, enzyme activity and protein-protein interaction in response to a number of environmental signals and stimuli  <cit> .

the majority of the putative rrs identified in this study were classified into the following  <dig> families: narl, lyttr, amir and ompr, with rrs of the ompr family constituting the largest group. for each of the  <dig> compared strains the distributions of their rrs within these families are highlighted in table  <dig>  the assignment of rrs of the  <dig> tcs clusters and the orphan rrs to the corresponding rr families is given in table  <dig> 

while most rrs contain a dna binding domain, there were two exceptions: the putative rr of tcs- <dig> lacked any currently known output domains and therefore could not be assigned to any of the known rr families. the rr  of tcs- <dig>  a unique tcs cluster of s. ratti dsm <dig>  contained a rna-binding output domain and was found to be an amir-like response regulator. the amir family is a relatively newly defined response regulator family possessing rna-binding activity. in contrast to the commonly known phosphorylation mechanism in dna-binding rrs, amir is normally controlled by ligand-regulated activation, in keeping with the substitution of the conserved aspartate phosphoryl acceptor residue by serine, as well as the replacements of additional amino acid residues required for phosphoryl transfer  <cit> . however, unlike the classical amir-like proteins, residues involved in phosphoryl transfer are conserved in the rr of tcs- <dig>  in addition, we have identified its cognate hk . therefore, we believe that rr of tcs- <dig> is most likely activated by its cognate hk through phosphorylation.

rrs of the ompr family constituted the largest group . proteins of the ompr family have been reported to mediate a wide range of biological functions related to, for example, osmolarity, phosphate assimilation, antibiotic resistance, virulence and toxicity  <cit> . narl proteins differ from those of the ompr family due to the presence of the luxr_c-like dna-binding hth domain. members of the narl family have been documented to control expression of genes related to nitrogen fixation, sugar phosphate transport, nitrate and nitrite metabolism, quorum sensing, and osmotic stress etc.  <cit> . proteins of the lyttr family are characterized by having a non-hth dna binding domain  <cit> . they account for about 3% of all the prokaryotic rrs  <cit> . despite being found in prokaryotic genomes in small numbers when compared to other rr families, the lyttr type rr proteins have been reported to modulate the expression of many genes coding for virulence factors, fimbriae, cell wall components, bacteriocins, extracellular polysaccharides etc.  <cit> . also of interest is the fact that rrs belonging to ntrc, arac, spo0a, fis, ycbb, rpoe and merr families, which often appear in other bacterial genomes, are totally absent in the mutans streptococci strains compared in this study.

co-occurrence of certain hk and rr families
the homology box-based classification of hk proteins has been shown to be able to reveal the co-occurrence relationships between the various kinase families and regulator families  <cit> . in other words, specific families of hk were preferentially associated with specific families of rr proteins. in this study, certain pairing combinations between the hk families and the rr families were also observed in the mutans streptococci strains as shown in table  <dig>  for instance, all hks of the hpk <dig> family are paired with corresponding rrs of the ompr family, and all hks of the hpk <dig> family constitute tcs clusters with rrs of the narl family. hks of both the hpk <dig> and hpk <dig> kinase families prefer rrs of the lyttr family as their corresponding cognate response regulators. we reckon that such combinations may play a significant role in the phenomenon of cross-talking between unpaired hks and rrs, e.g. a hk of the hpk <dig> family is highly likely to cross-phosphorylate an unpaired rr of the ompr family. cross-talking mechanisms have been reported to exist in many bacterial species  <cit>  and have also been speculated to appear in streptococcus mutans strains  <cit> . such a strategy could be advantageous for mutans streptococci strains to maximally utilize their relatively small complement of tcss for processing diverse signals so as to ensure a flexibly coordinated response to the constantly changing environments. for example, while a viable knock-out mutant of the vick gene coding for the hk of tcs- <dig> could be obtained, the cognate response regulator vicr has been found to be essential for the survival of s. mutans ua <dig>  <cit> . it has also been reported that no viable vicr knockout mutants could be obtained for streptococcus pneumoniae, but knockout of the corresponding histidine kinase gene vick is possible, because vicr can be phosphorylated in vivo by vans, a gene coding for a tcs histidine kinase from enterococcus faecium, which helps to suppress some effects of a vick kinase disruption in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . according to homology box analysis the histidine kinase vans of enterococcus faecium belongs to hpk <dig> family like vick. thus, we speculate that such cross-phosphorylation of vicr by a non-cognate hk most likely also holds true in s. mutans ua <dig>  and probably also for other mutans streptococci strains. clearly, the systematic classification of hks and rrs carried out in this study reveals potential cross-talking candidates that will be helpful in the future studies of two-component systems.

putative biological functions of the identified tcs proteins
in the following sections, possible biological functions and significance of the tcs genes/proteins, which were common or specific to the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains as presented in table  <dig>  are discussed. to this end and for the purpose of a better overview, we have briefly summarized available knowledge on the biological functions of the tcs genes/proteins of the best studied s. mutans strain ua <dig>  in case no knowledge is available about the functions of some tcss, information about putative orthologs of the corresponding tcs genes/proteins in organisms other than s. mutans ua <dig> are provided .

tcs
in case no knowledge is available on the functions of some tcss in ua <dig>  reports on homologous tcss in other microorganisms, preferably streptococcus species  are provided.

tcs proteins common to all the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains
proteins of the tcs clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the orphan rr <dig> are common to all the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains compared here, indicating probably the functional importance of these tcs clusters for the adaptation and survival of these mutans streptococci . for instance, orphan rr <dig> is highly conserved across the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains. in s. mutans ua <dig>  this orphan rr is encoded by gcrr  and has been found to play a vital role in sucrose-dependent adherence and cariogenesis  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that conservation of this gene across the mutans streptococci strains is essential for their primary pathogenicity.

tcs proteins uniquely present/absent in one or several strains
the tcs- <dig>  cluster was predicted to be absent in s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  covsr is involved in the acid tolerance response of s. mutans ua  <dig>  <cit> , and has also been reported to be involved in counteracting oxidative stress and reducing susceptibility to phagocytic killing  <cit> . tcs- <dig> , which affects the acid tolerance response as well  <cit> , was also absent in s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  the absence of the covs and levs genes was experimentally supported by the pcr results shown in figure  <dig>  in s. mutans ua <dig>  the levrs gene cluster is flanked by levq and levt, which code for two carbohydrate-binding proteins. these four genes together constitute a four-component signal transduction system levqrst controlling the transcription of the fructan hydrolase gene  and a four-gene cluster levdefg, which encode a fructose/mannose sugar:phosphotransferase system located immediately downstream of levqrst  <cit> . s. sobrinus was also found to lack the levq, levt and levdefg genes. taking together, these findings indicate dramatic differences in the regulation of fructan catabolism and the acid tolerance response of s. sobrinus dsm <dig> in comparison to the s. mutans strains.

it should be pointed out that the tcs nomenclature is unfortunately inconsistent among the published articles on tcss of s. mutans strains. many publications  <cit>  on covr actually address the orphan response regulator rr <dig> which is known as gcrr  in s. mutans ua <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, covsr of s. mutans has also been confusingly named as scnkr  <cit> . in our study, the nomenclature of tcs genes/proteins was based primarily on the oralgen pathogen sequence database http://www.oralgen.lanl.gov. in cases where several names were given for a gene in oralgen, gene names used by biswas et al.  <cit>  were preferably used.

tcs- <dig>  could be neither found in the two s. mutans strains atcc <dig> and nctc <dig> nor in s. ratti dsm <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  the asymmetric distribution of tcs- <dig> was also observed in a previous study, in which tcs- <dig> was found to be present only in two of the  <dig> s. mutans strains compared  <cit> . in s. mutans ua <dig>  an insertion mutant of scnk gene displayed no significant difference to the wild type with respect to growth under various stress conditions  <cit> . in streptococcus pyogenes, scnkr was found to be essential for the production of a bacteriocin   <cit> . by a closer look at the genes in the neighborhood of scnkr in the  <dig> strains studied, we found that s. mutans kk <dig> and s. mutans nn <dig> carried two and three genes, respectively, which encode putative bacteriocin precursor peptides sharing more than 60% similarity with saff <dig>  in addition, a putative bacteriocin biosynthesis protein coding gene was also found downstream of the scnkr operon in the two s. mutans strains. we therefore infer that tcs- <dig>  might be involved in the regulation of mutacin production at least in s. mutans kk <dig> and s. mutans nn <dig> 

tcs- <dig>  was only shared by the eight s. mutans strains. in s. mutans ua <dig>  an insertion mutant of the gene encoding phor displayed no significant difference to the wild type with respect to growth under various stress conditions  <cit> . the clear function of tcs- <dig> is still unknown.

as mentioned before in the identification and classification of tcs proteins, tcs- <dig>  was absent in s. ratti dsm <dig>  this finding was also supported by the pcr experiment . in s. mutans, comde is the most extensively studied two-component signaling system involved in quorum sensing and competence development. mediated by the so-called competence stimulating peptide , it is involved in multiple stress responses and has been implicated in competence development, bacteriocin production, virulence, biofilm formation, and cariogenicity  <cit> . further analysis showed that the ortholog of the comc gene, whose product is the precursor of the signal peptide csp sensed by comde in s. mutans, was absent in s. ratti. putative orthologs of comd and come were found in s. sobrinus dsm <dig>  however, with a similarity of merely 37% and 43%, respectively, to the comd and come of s. mutans ua <dig> , it's highly possible that the actual function of tcs- <dig> in s. sobrinus dsm <dig> might be quite different from that known for s. mutans. it is also worthy to mention that no comc-like gene was found in s. sobrinus dsm <dig> 

putative alleles of the hk and rr proteins of tcs- <dig> are present in five of the s. mutans strains, namely  <dig> dc <dig>  kk <dig>  kk <dig>  ua <dig> and nn <dig> . this cluster was first identified in s. mutans ua <dig> by biswas et al. and the corresponding hk and rr are encoded by smu. <dig> and smu. <dig>  respectively  <cit> . they also found that tcs- <dig> was present only in two of the  <dig> s. mutans strains compared in their study. hks of this tcs cluster contain only one recognizable hatpase_c domain . in addition, no known output domain was identified in the cognate rrs. thus, neither hks nor rrs of tcs- <dig> could be classified into any known hk and rr families. in addition, as depicted by the multi-sequence alignment of the putative tcs- <dig> hk alleles in additional file  <dig>  the open reading frame predictions carried out in our study revealed that while smu. <dig> and its upstream gene smu. <dig> clearly constitute two separate genes in s. mutans ua <dig>  they are merged to constitute the parts of a single gene coding for the hks in the s. mutans strains  <dig> dc <dig>  kk <dig> and nn <dig>  the corresponding hk of kk <dig> was also split into two proteins by the lacking of a single glutamine  residue.

tcs- <dig> was found exclusively in the genome of the serotype f blood isolate s. mutans nctc <dig> . genes of a tcs located on the genomic island tnsmu <dig> of s. mutans ua <dig>  as recently reported by the research group qi  <cit> , could be possible alleles of tcs- <dig> genes. this was based on the fact that the predicted hks and rrs of both tcs  <dig> in our study and the tcs found by qi's group have the hk  and rr  of streptococcus equi, respectively, as the best matched homologs. the hk  of tcs- <dig> is also the only histidine kinase found in this study that contains a pdz domain . pdz domain was first reported to be present in animals. in  <dig>  ponting et al. claimed that pdz domains exist also in diverse signaling proteins of bacteria, yeasts and plants. experimental evidence was first provided by liao et al. through the determination of the first crystal structure of a bacterial pdz domain  <cit> . the most remarkable feature of pdz domains is their ability to specifically recognize and bind to short c-terminal peptide motifs. this allows them especially to bind membrane proteins such as ion channels, which have very small free c-termini. to exclude the possibility of contamination with e. g. human dna during the process of genome sequencing, the existence of the gene coding for this unusual pdz domain-containing hk protein in the dna of the nctc <dig> strain was experimentally verified by using two different forward primers in the pcr experiment .

the pdz domain of smh| <dig> is flanked by one transmembrane helix  at its n-terminal side and  <dig> tms at its c-terminal side, which is characteristic of a comp-like hk. comp-like hks are a group of sensors of another peptide-dependent quorum sensing system related to cell density-responsive regulation other than comde in gram-positive bacteria. in b. subtilis, comp is the sensor histidine kinase of the four-component comqxpa quorum sensing system, where coma stands for the corresponding response regulator, comx is the pheromone precursor and comq the protein required for the proteolytic cleavage and modification of the pheromone precursor molecule  <cit> . the most similar homolog of smh| <dig> found from a blastp search in the ncbi database http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ with a sequence identity of around 65% is the histidine kinase  of a tcs from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis kf <dig>  furthermore, we found that the cognate response regulator of tcs- <dig> showed a sequence identity of around 78% with the corresponding response regulator  from the same l. lactis subsp. lactis strain. in our study, the rr  of tcs- <dig> was termed as cmpr . it should be mentioned that neither l. lactis subsp. lactis kf <dig> nor s. mutans nctc <dig> possesses homologs of the b. subtilis comx and comq. thus, the signal peptide sensed by comp/cmpr in s. mutans nctc <dig> remains unknown.

tcs- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are uniquely present in s. ratti dsm <dig> . according to blastp searches against the ncbi database, the top matches to the tcs- <dig> hk protein  or the rr protein  are all from streptococcus species such as streptococcus infantarius and streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, the hk and rr homologs in the different streptococcus species are all encoded by two adjacent genes and annotated in some s. agalactiae strains as sensor histidine kinase dlts and dna-binding response regulator dltr. the dltsr has been reported to be involved in the regulation of d-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis in s. agalactiae  <cit> . lipoteichoic acid  is a major cell wall constituent of gram-positive bacteria which is phosphoglycerol substituted with a d-ala ester or a glycosyl residue and anchored in the membrane by its glycolipid moiety. d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid has been proven to contribute to the virulence of streptococcus suis  <cit> , as well as to the biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobial peptides in enterococci  <cit> . thus, the tcs- <dig> cluster might also be an important virulence factor in s. ratti.

the tcs- <dig> was composed of a hamp-containing hk and an ompr-type rr. the best homologs of the hk protein  and the rr protein  are from s. agalactiae strains. but the functions of these homologous proteins remain unknown.

tcs- <dig> is the only cluster that comprises a hpk  <dig> family hk and an amir family rr, which possesses a novel rna-binding type output domain. the top ten best hits of the blastp search in the ncbi database showed that the closest homologs for the hk and rr of tcs- <dig> are all from listeria species. since the hk of tcs- <dig> possesses a pas domain that is commonly involved in sensing intracellular signals such as redox potential, similar to the sensing mechanism described for the hk  of tcs- <dig>  the function of tcs- <dig> might also be related to the sensing and response to signal originated in the cytoplasm. the unique presence of tcs- <dig> in s. ratti dsm <dig> was also confirmed by the pcr experiment .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we conducted a genome-wide identification, classification, and ortholog analysis of the tcs proteins in eight newly sequenced mutans streptococci strains in comparison with two previously sequenced s. mutans strains, ua <dig> and nn <dig>  totally,  <dig> tcs clusters comprising hk-rr pairs were identified, with  <dig> of them shared by all the  <dig> strains compared,  <dig> being absent in one or more strains,  <dig> unique to s. mutans nctc <dig> and  <dig> exclusive to s. ratti dsm <dig>  s. mutans strains share to a large extend the same tcs repertoires. one remarkable exception is the unique presence of the putative quorum-sensing tcs- <dig>  in the only serotype f blood isolate, s. mutans nctc <dig>  s. sobrinus dsm <dig> shows differences to the s. mutans strains in the signal perceptions possibly related to fructan catabolism and acid tolerance response. with its  <dig> unique tcs clusters, s. ratti dsm <dig> seems even more distinct to the s. mutans strains. one of the unique tcs clusters is homologous to the dltsr tcs in streptococcus agalactiae strains that is probably involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of d-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid, an important cell wall component. another one has an amir-like rr protein, which is the only rr found in this study to contain a rna-binding output domain instead of a dna-binding output domain.

in addition to highlighting putative functions of the individual histidine kinases and response regulators, our detailed classification of the tcs proteins also confirms that specific hk families are preferentially associated with specific rr families. such associations might play significant roles in the phenomenon of cross-talking between unpaired hks and rrs.

the asymmetric distribution of tcs among the mutans streptococci strains compared in this study implies that s. mutans, s. sobrinus and s. ratti might employ different sensing and response mechanisms for their survival in the fast changing oral environment, mostly in a symbiotic lifestyle. we believe that the results from this genomic level study will be certainly helpful for the design of physiological studies and mutation analysis towards the verification of some hypotheses proposed in this study, which in turn will lead to a better understanding of signal transductions involved in the pathogenicities of mutans streptococci.
