BACKGROUND
voltage gated na+ channel β <dig>  subunits are multi-functional proteins that participate in inter- and intra-cellular communication on multiple time scales via modulation of electrical signal transduction and cell adhesion  <cit> . β <dig> subunits modulate na+ currents  <cit> , regulate the level of na+ channel cell surface expression  <cit> , and participate in cell adhesive interactions that lead to changes in cell migration  <cit> , cellular aggregation  <cit> , cytoskeletal recruitment  <cit> , and/or neurite outgrowth in vitro  <cit> . mice lacking β <dig> subunits exhibit seizure activity, ataxia, slowed action potential conduction, decreased numbers of mature nodes of ranvier in myelinated axons, alterations in nodal architecture, and differences in na+ channel α subunit localization  <cit> . thus, β <dig> subunits play critical roles in electrical excitability in vivo. however, while scn1b null mice are interesting, their early death at postnatal day  <dig> and complex phenotype make them a challenging model system.

as a first step toward development of an alternative model system in which to study the physiological roles of na+ channel β <dig> subunits in vivo we chose d. rerio. this is an attractive model system with a number of advantages over mice, including the production of large numbers of embryos per single pair mating, external fertilization with transparent larvae allowing for genetic manipulation from the one cell stage, and rapid development  <cit> . embryos contain most of their adult structures by  <dig> hours post-fertilization  and the majority of external and internal organs reach maturity by  <dig> days post-fertilization . other commonly studied genetic model systems such as drosophila or c. elegans were not appropriate for an in vivo investigation of na+ channel β subunits. there are no obvious candidates for voltage-gated na+ channel gene orthologs in the genome of c. elegans  <cit> . while the drosophila genome encodes two na+ channel α subunit genes, orthologs of na+ channel β subunits appear to be lacking, suggesting that these subunits arose in evolution after the appearance of invertebrates  <cit> . na+ channel α subunit genes have been extensively studied in zebrafish, where eight different scna orthologs have been identified  <cit> . this is the first description of the structure and localization of a zebrafish na+ channel β subunit ortholog, although sequences of scn2b, scn3b, and scn4b orthologs have recently been reported in genbank. in the present study we report the cloning and expression of zebrafish scn1ba. two alternate splice forms of scn1ba with distinct c-terminal domains, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig>  are expressed in zebrafish mrna. both modulate na+ currents expressed by zebrafish scn8aa α subunits. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical experiments show localization of zebrafish β <dig> subunits in brain, spinal cord, sensory neurons, and skeletal muscle. interestingly, one of the splice variants, scn1ba_tv <dig>  is expressed in optic nerve while the other splice variant, scn1ba_tv <dig>  is not detectable in this tissue. zebrafish are an ideal system in which to determine the contribution of na+ channel β <dig> subunits to neuronal development and to the establishment and maintenance of electrical excitability in vivo.

RESULTS
zebrafish scn1ba is expressed as two splice variants
the sanger zebrafish database was searched for translated ests with homology to the rat scn1b peptide sequence , which shares 96% to 99% identity with the mouse, rabbit, and human β <dig> homologs  <cit> . short regions of homology were identified and several ests were aligned. portions of these sequences were used to design forward and reverse oligonucleotide pcr primers that were then used to amplify a  <dig> base pair product from a zebrafish retinal library as described in methods. this product encoded a cdna with a predicted peptide sequence containing high homology to rat scn1b. we then performed race followed by an additional round of pcr using nested primers to generate a full-length cdna. this reaction resulted in the amplification of two clones, each encoding peptides with significant homology to scn1b: scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig>  respectively.

alignment of the scn1b, scn1ba_tv <dig>  and scn1ba_tv <dig> peptide sequences is presented in fig 1a. overall, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1b share  <dig> % identity, with  <dig> % of residues strongly similar, and  <dig> % of residues weakly similar. zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> shares  <dig> % identity with scn1b, with  <dig> % of residues strongly similar, and  <dig> % of residues weakly similar. zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are identical except for their c-termini. both zebrafish subunits contain a predicted n-terminal signal peptide followed by the start of the mature protein at residue alanine- <dig>  corresponding to the experimentally confirmed site in scn1b  <cit> . both subunits contain conserved cysteines predicted to form the extracellular β <dig> immunoglobulin  loop domain in mammals  <cit> . residues forming the a/a' face of the ig domain are conserved. this region has been shown to contain important sites of α-β <dig> interaction  <cit> . the zebrafish β subunits contain four predicted n-linked glycosylation sites. three of the four correspond to those predicted in scn1b   <cit> . the fourth site , is not conserved in scn1b. the fourth glycosylation site predicted in scn1b corresponds to the predicted zebrafish residue histidine- <dig>  interestingly, this glycosylation site present in scn1b is absent in scn3b  <cit> . comparing the ig domain β sheets of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> with scn1b reveals significant differences in the c, c", f, and g strands, with the most significant differences in the c" region. the c-terminal domain of scn1ba_tv <dig> is  <dig> amino acids shorter than that of scn1ba_tv <dig> and lacks the c-terminal tyrosine corresponding to tyrosine- <dig> in scn1b which has been demonstrated to be important for the recruitment of ankyrin, subcellular localization, and channel modulation  <cit> . zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> contains a lysine in the position corresponding to rat tyrosine- <dig>  but within a novel c-terminal tail.

zebrafish scn1ba, according to the zebrafish nomenclature convention  <cit> , was identified on a bac containing a contig from linkage group   <dig> . conserved synteny was found for the region of lg <dig> containing scn1ba and regions surrounding scn1b on human chromosome  <dig> and scn1b on mouse chromosome  <dig>  genes closely linked to scn1b on the mouse chromosome were compared to this region of the zebrafish genome using the blast program. predicted genes for zebrafish orthologs were then mapped against the zebrafish zv <dig> assembly  <cit>  to determine their linkage group designations. located in close apposition to scn1ba are hepsin, gramd1a, and fxyd, genes that are also closely linked with scn1b in the mouse and scn1b in human genomes, confirming that scn1ba is orthologous to the mammalian genes. analysis of scn1ba showed exon-intron boundaries in agreement with the published sites for mammalian scn1b  <cit> . the alternative c-terminal coding sequences contained in scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> were both found within exon  <dig> of scn1ba. two alternative 3' splice acceptor sites, located at the beginning of exon  <dig> and internal to exon  <dig> respectively, separated by  <dig> base pairs, were identified . the internal acceptor site, initiating the scn1ba_tv <dig> c-terminus, is a weak, non-consensus sequence containing a rare thymidine as the first base of the internal exon   <cit> . to confirm the expression of each of these splice variants in the zebrafish mrna pool, we performed a single rt-pcr reaction using whole fish rna as template with a forward primer encoding the region corresponding to the a strand of the ig domain shared by scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> and a reverse primer encoding the 3' end of the putative alternative c-terminal sequence of scn1ba_tv <dig> and found in the 3' untranslated region  of scn1ba_tv <dig> . as shown in fig. 1d, this reaction amplified two bands of  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, respectively. these products were subsequently confirmed by dna sequencing to be identical to the zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> cdnas cloned in the original reactions. thus, scn1ba is expressed in zebrafish as two alternatively spliced products.

mammalian scn1b alternate splice products have been identified previously and this scn1b alternate splicing appears to be species-specific. a scn1b alternate splice product has been described in rat, β <dig> , arising from retention of intron  <dig> and resulting in a novel 3' utr  <cit> . rat β1a  <cit>   is encoded via retention of intron  <dig>  generating β <dig> polypeptides with novel transmembrane and intracellular domains that are species-specific. translation of scn1ba intron  <dig> in frame with exon  <dig> predicts a short peptide extension beyond exon  <dig> containing  <dig> amino acids  that would produce a truncated, soluble protein. we have not yet found evidence for expression of these alternatively spliced mrnas in zebrafish.

in situ hybridization analysis
we used in situ hybridization analysis to investigate the expression of scn1ba mrna at  <dig> hpf,  <dig> hpf, and  <dig> dpf. an anti-sense crna probe corresponding to both the 3' utr and coding region of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> was used. a sense probe was used as a control and resulted in no specific staining . because the alternative c-terminus expressed in scn1ba_tv <dig> is contained within the 3' utr of scn1ba_tv <dig>  these probes did not distinguish between the two subunits. thus, these results represent the combined expression of the two mrna species. as shown in fig. 2a–d, we observed cns expression beginning at  <dig> hpf in the olfactory placode , midbrain  , hindbrain , and trigeminal neurons  . extensive staining was also observed in the skeletal muscle cells  of the trunk at  <dig> hpf . in addition to staining in skeletal muscle, staining was observed in the rohon beard neurons  in the spinal cord . at  <dig> hpf, expression patterns were not changed, although the overall intensity of staining in the brain had increased . at  <dig> dpf  robust expression was visible in the spinal cord , and expression was evident in the olfactory pit  and the retina, as well as in the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and trigeminal ganglia  . na+ currents have been recorded in zebrafish rohon beard neurons in vivo. in these cells, na+ currents undergo developmentally regulated increases in amplitude, hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of activation, and acceleration of fast inactivation  <cit> . these results are consistent with expression of a β <dig> subunit that increases with development, promoting cell surface channel expression, and modulating na+ current, and are supported by our in situ hybridization results.

antibody characterization
to investigate whether both of the scn1ba slice products are expressed and if so, whether they are differentially localized in developing fish, polyclonal antibodies were designed to the unique c-terminal regions of each polypeptide. fig.  <dig> demonstrates the specificity of these antibodies using western blot analysis. chinese hamster lung  <dig> cells transiently transfected with cdna encoding scn1ba_tv <dig>  scn1ba_tv <dig>  or empty vector  were tested, as well as rat brain and zebrafish brain membranes. in fig. 3a, left panel, we show that anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> recognized a protein band at ~ <dig> kd in  <dig> cells transfected with a scn1ba_tv <dig> expression plasmid, as well as two bands, at ~ <dig> kd and ~ <dig> kd, respectively, in rat brain. this result may reflect differential glycosylation of β <dig> in the cell line vs. brain, where both forms appear to be expressed. protein bands were not detected in  <dig> cells that were mock transfected or transfected with cdna encoding scn1ba_tv <dig>  fig. 3a, right panel, shows anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> immunoreactive bands at ~ <dig> kd and ~ <dig> kd in both rat brain and zebrafish brain. the immunoreactive signal was blocked following preadsorption of the antibody with its immunizing peptide. in a similar experiment, anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> recognized a specific protein band at ~ <dig> kd in  <dig> cells transfected with a scn1ba_tv <dig> expression plasmid . no bands were detected in cells that were mock transfected or transfected with scn1ba_tv <dig> cdna. in contrast to anti-scn1ba_tv <dig>  anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> did not identify any protein bands in rat brain, consistent with our inability to identify a similar translated sequence from scn1b exon  <dig>  and suggesting that scn1ba_tv <dig> is a species-specific splice variant. in fig. 3b, right panel, we show that anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> recognizes a ~ <dig> kd immunoreactive band in zebrafish brain that is blocked following preadsorption of the antibody with the immunizing peptide. again, we propose that there are differences in the extent of β <dig> glycosylation in the cell line vs. brain.

the specificity of these antibodies was further demonstrated using immunohistochemical methods. fluorescent signals from the anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> or anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> antibodies were blocked by pre-absorption of each antibody with its corresponding peptide for  <dig> h at room temperature . normally, anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> and anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> both show robust staining in the retina as shown below, however pre-incubation with the corresponding peptides dramatically reduced the signals to background levels.

zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> protein expression
anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> and anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> antibodies were used to determine the localization of these subunits in fish. we showed previously that a key tyrosine residue  in the c-terminus of scn1b is critical for β1-ankyrin interactions and β <dig> subcellular localization  <cit> . because the c-terminal domain of scn1ba_tv <dig> contains a tyrosine residue in the position corresponding to tyrosine- <dig> in scn1b while scn1ba_tv <dig> does not, we hypothesized that these subunits may be differentially localized in vivo. antibodies specific to each subunit were used to stain both whole fish and cryosectioned fish to test this hypothesis.

in whole mount embryos, the expression patterns of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf were found to be similar . zebrafish contain a set of mechanosensory organs, or neuromasts, that allow sensing of changes in water movement. these mechanosensory organs are divided into two categories: those in the anterior lateral line , e.g. localized in the head; and those in the posterior lateral line , e.g. localized in the trunk or tail  <cit> . both anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> and anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> labeled neuromasts in the all and pll  as early as  <dig> hpf. additionally, both anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> and anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> labeled the olfactory pit , another early developing sensory system . these results are consistent with the combined staining patterns for scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> antisense rna observed in the in situ hybridization experiments, although mrna expression was observed at earlier developmental stages than protein expression, suggesting a developmental delay between transcription and translation.

fish that were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> dpf were mounted in oct and cryosectioned. slices were stained with anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> or anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> antibodies as described in methods and viewed with a fluorescent microscope. sections were co-stained with anti-acetylated α-tubulin as a neuronal marker. by  <dig> dpf full expression was observed for both scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig>  as the pattern and intensity of staining did not change with ongoing development for either antibody. staining patterns shown in subsequent figures are representative pictures for fish ages  <dig> through  <dig> dpf and are not reflective of a time course of expression for either subunit.

in agreement with antibody staining in whole mount embryos , sectioned fish exhibited staining at olfactory pits  and this was observed for both scn1ba_tv <dig>  and scn1ba_tv <dig> . dorsal views showed robust staining of both anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> and anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> that coincided with anti-acetylated α-tubulin . examination of whole brain sections  revealed anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining in the optic nerve , tectum opticum , and post optic commissure  . anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> stained rostral hypothalamus  independently of anti-acetylated α-tubulin but was absent from the subcommissural organ , where acetylated α-tubulin was strongly expressed . in contrast, there appeared to be generalized scn1ba_tv <dig> staining that was diffuse throughout many brain regions . most interestingly, anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining was not detected in optic nerve  and optic chiasm .

β subunit protein expression was examined in greater detail in the retina and optic nerve . anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining was absent or weak in the optic nerve, indicated by the red staining in the merged image of optic nerve in fig. 6a–b  and fig. 7a . when we examined retinal patterning we found that anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> stained throughout the layers of the retina with the strongest staining at the inner plexiform layer , outer plexiform layer , and outer limiting membrane  . staining was weaker in the ganglion cell layer  and photoreceptor layer , and weakest or absent in the inner nuclear layer . in the inl, anti-acetylated α-tubulin appeared to label axonal tracts that were not labeled by anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> . labeling with anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> demonstrated similar retinal patterning as scn1ba_tv <dig> . zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> is expressed in the ipl, opl, and olm. similar to anti-scn1ba_tv <dig>  staining for anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> was weaker in the gcl, pr, and inl . most interestingly, scn1ba_tv <dig> appeared to be robustly expressed in optic nerve , in contrast to scn1ba_tv <dig>  resulting in a yellow signal at optic nerve in the merged image .

to further investigate the differential localization of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> subunits in optic nerve, we analyzed cryosections generated from  <dig> dpf zebrafish by confocal microscopy . zebrafish optic nerves are surrounded with compact myelin at  <dig> dpf  <cit> . thus, at this time point  we expected it might be possible to visualize staining at nodes of ranvier if β <dig> subunits were indeed expressed in these specialized subcellular domains. fig. 8a–c demonstrates the expression of scn1ba_tv <dig> at optic nerve. punctate staining suggests localization of this protein at nodes of ranvier, consistent with our previous observations in mice  <cit> . in contrast to anti-scn1ba_tv <dig>  the anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> antibody did not produce detectable staining in optic nerve . in order to further determine if scn1ba_tv <dig> stained at nodes of ranvier we dissected adult nerves and examined them at higher resolution in combination with antibodies for nodal and paranodal markers. anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining remained punctate and did overlap with nodes in some areas; however at this resolution we also observed significant background staining that made it impossible to confirm nodal staining . thus, with our current reagents we are unable to confirm that anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> stains at nodes, although the punctate pattern is suggestive of nodal staining.

next, we examined the localization of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> in spinal cord using cryosectioned fish . the results of our in situ hybridization experiments predicted expression of one or both subunits in this area. in longitudinal sections we observed strong anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining in peripherally located fiber tracks that were positive for anti-acetylated α-tubulin . anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining was also observed in acetylated α-tubulin negative cells lining the central canal of the spinal cord . in contrast to scn1ba_tv <dig>  anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining was observed in acetylated α-tubulin negative cells in the spinal cord but appeared to be absent from the peripheral acetylated α-tubulin positive fibers .

zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are both expressed in striated skeletal muscle , however, neither subunit was detected in cardiac muscle . we observed two distinct patterns of skeletal muscle staining for anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> . this antibody labeled t-tubules, giving rise to the characteristic striated pattern of skeletal muscle , and stained in a punctate pattern along the longitudinal edges of the muscle cells . to investigate whether these puncta correspond to neuromuscular junctions, we stained with anti-scn1ba_tv <dig>  and then co-stained with α-bungarotoxin  to mark neuromuscular junctions ; however, these two staining patterns did not overlap . staining along the edges of the muscle is consistent with the localization of na+ channels at the muscle surface  <cit> . anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining  was also localized to the t-tubule system in skeletal muscle. unlike anti-scn1ba_tv <dig>  however, punctate staining was not observed along the muscle edge, possibly revealing another tissue in which scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are differentially localized. similar to anti-scn1ba_tv <dig>  anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> staining did not coincide with that of btx .

to summarize our immunohistochemical results, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are differentially localized in some tissues but not in others. most notably, scn1ba_tv <dig> is strongly expressed in optic nerve where punctate staining is suggestive of clustering at nodes of ranvier, similar to mammalian β <dig> subunits  <cit> , although we were not able to confirm this at high resolution. in contrast, we found no evidence for expression of scn1ba_tv <dig> in optic nerve. zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> is also localized in peripheral, acetylated α-tubulin positive fiber tracts of the spinal cord and at the surface of skeletal muscle myocytes. no staining for anti-scn1ba_tv <dig> was observed in these areas. thus, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are differentially localized in some tissues in vivo, including brain, optic nerve, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle.

clustering of na+ channels at mammalian axon initial segments and nodes of ranvier is dependent on the expression of ankyrin and key l <dig> family cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . previous results from our group have shown that mammalian β1-ankyrin association in vitro is dependent on the presence of a non-phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the β <dig> c-terminal domain  <cit> . similar to β <dig>  tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of l <dig> family cell adhesion molecules, such as neurofascin, at the figqy motif abolishes their ability to interact with ankyrin, establishing specialized ankyrin-dependent and ankyrin-independent microdomains in neurons  <cit> . non-phosphorylated neurofascin interacts with ankyring at nodes of ranvier while tyrosine-phosphorylated l <dig> family cell adhesion molecules are found at other specialized sites of cell-cell contact such as paranodes of sciatic nerve, neuromuscular junctions, adherens junctions, and regions of neuronal migration and axon extension  <cit> . the figqy/h mutation in human l <dig> results in clinical disease, demonstrating that this tyrosine residue is critical for normal development of the nervous system  <cit> . we propose that β <dig> polypeptides containing a non-phosphorylated c-terminal tyrosine residue are localized with ankyring at nodes of ranvier in myelinated axons. tyrosine-phosphorylated β <dig> or β1-like subunits containing an alternate c-terminus, e.g. scn1ba_tv <dig>  are proposed to be localized to non-ankyrin-dependent domains where they are available to interact with other structural and signaling molecules, including different na+ channel α subunits. we have demonstrated that mammalian β <dig> retains its ability to associate with α subunits, but loses its ability to modulate na+ currents, when tyrosine- <dig> is mutated to glutamate to mimic phosphorylation  <cit> . thus, we propose that differential localization of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> in zebrafish may result in differential na+ current modulation and altered electrical excitability, depending on the specific association of α and β1-like subunits in different neuronal subpopulations. we have also shown that mammalian β <dig> promotes neurite outgrowth as a result of β1-β <dig> homophilic cell adhesion  <cit> . our results suggest that extracellular β1-mediated homophilic adhesion activates an intracellular signal transduction cascade in the neuron. while the extracellular domains of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are identical, their intracellular domains are significantly different. thus, while both β1-like subunits may function similarly in homophilic adhesion, their subsequent activation of intracellular signaling cascades is likely to be different and reflected in the resultant neuronal response. for example, we have shown that while β <dig> promotes neurite extension in cerebellar granule neurons, β <dig>  which lacks an intracellular tyrosine residue, inhibits neurite extension  <cit> . it is possible that scn1ba_tv <dig>  which contains an intracellular tyrosine, promotes neurite outgrowth through a similar mechanism to β <dig>  while scn1ba_tv <dig>  which does not contain an intracellular tyrosine, inhibits neurite outgrowth, similar to β <dig> 

interestingly, zebrafish neurons express two l1-related genes, l <dig>  and l <dig> , that have different c-terminal domains. the c-terminus of l <dig>  is similar to mammalian l <dig> and contains the figqy motif. in contrast, and similar to scn1ba_tv <dig>  l <dig>  contains a different c-terminal domain that does not include the figqy motif  <cit> . while l <dig>  and l <dig>  are encoded by separate genes in zebrafish and the immunohistochemical localization of these proteins has not yet been reported, the differences in their c-terminal domains are striking similar to the situation described in this study for scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> splice variants.

zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> modulate na+ currents expressed by scn8aa
to investigate the effects of zebrafish β <dig> subunits on na+ channel expression and function, we injected xenopus oocytes with in vitro transcribed crnas encoding either scn1ba_tv <dig> or scn1ba_tv <dig> together with crna encoding scn8aa  and examined the properties of the expressed na+ currents with two electrode voltage clamp recording. crna encoding rat scn1b was coinjected with scn8aa for comparison. these data are the first report of functional expression of any zebrafish na+ channel α or β subunit. co-expression of scn8aa with rat or zebrafish β <dig> subunits resulted in predicted shifts in channel gating mode from slow to fast , increases in current amplitude , hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation , and increases in the rate of channel recovery from inactivation , effects that are characteristic of mammalian β <dig> subunits  <cit> . however, and as described below, while these effects were qualitatively similar between the rat and zebrafish β <dig> subunits, there were important quantitative differences in the extent of channel modulation.

to examine the effects of β <dig> subunits on the kinetics of na+ current activation and inactivation, we recorded macroscopic na+ currents. in response to depolarization, na+ currents expressed by all combinations of scn8aa ± β <dig> subunits activated rapidly, although there was a slight speeding of the rate of current activation in the presence of scn1b, scn1ba_tv <dig>  or scn1ba_tv <dig> compared to scn8aa alone , as shown previously for scn1b  <cit> . shown in fig. 11c are representative families of na+ current traces for the combinations of α and β <dig> subunits shown in panel a. panel d shows representative current-voltage relationships for these α-β <dig> subunit combinations. in contrast to activation, the various combinations of scn8aa and β <dig> subunits exhibited very different time courses of current inactivation . in oocytes expressing scn8aa alone, the inactivation time course had two distinct components, a fast phase and a prominent slow phase that accounted for greater than 50% of the current, reflecting subpopulations of channels in fast and slow gating modes, respectively  <cit> . as shown previously for scn1b  <cit> , coexpression of scn1ba_tv <dig> or scn1ba_tv <dig> with scn8aa accelerated the inactivation time course by shifting the majority of channels to the fast gating mode. in contrast to coexpression of scn1b, however, neither zebrafish β <dig> subunit fully shifted the population of channels to the fast gating mode, leaving a significant proportion of channels in the slow gating mode. over the time course of the experiment, currents expressed by scn8aa alone or scn8aa coexpressed with scn1b inactivated fully. in contrast, currents expressed by scn8aa and scn1ba_tv <dig> or scna8aa and scn1ba_tv <dig> did not inactivate completely, leaving a small fraction of the current that was non-inactivating.

coexpression of either of the zebrafish β <dig> subunits with scn8aa increased na+ current amplitude compared to scn8aa alone, as shown previously for mammalian α and β <dig> subunits  <cit> . fig. 11b presents mean peak current amplitudes recorded following injection of various combinations of scn8aa ± β <dig> subunits. for each experiment, individual current amplitudes measured for each condition were normalized to the mean current measured in response to injection of scn8aa alone. coinjection of scn1b increased the na+ current amplitude by approximately  <dig> -fold. coinjection of the zebrafish β <dig> subunits also increased the current amplitude but to a lesser extent. zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> increased the current amplitude approximately 5-fold while scn1ba_tv <dig> increased the current amplitude approximately  <dig> -fold. attempts at injecting higher concentrations of zebrafish β <dig> subunit crnas were unsuccessful, as this resulted in oocyte toxicity.

when we examined the voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation we found that co-expression of scn8aa with scn1b produced the expected hyperpolarizing shift, similar to that observed with mammalian na+ channel α and β <dig> crnas  <cit>  . the half voltage of activation for scn8aa expressed alone was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, and the half voltage of inactivation was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv. when co-expressed with scn1b, the half voltage of activation was - <dig>  ±  <dig> , and the half voltage of inactivation was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv. these values represent significant - <dig>  mv and - <dig>  mv shifts, respectively  and are similar to those reported for coexpression of mammalian scn8a and scn1b . co-expression of scn8aa with scn1ba_tv <dig> or scn1ba_tv <dig> also produced leftward shifts in the voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation , however, while significant, these shifts were not as dramatic as those mediated by co-expression of scn1b. the half voltage of activation for scn8aa plus scn1ba_tv <dig> was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, a - <dig> mv shift in comparison to scn8aa alone . the half voltage of activation for scn8aa plus scn1ba_tv <dig> was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, a - <dig>  mv change compared to scn8aa alone . zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> were significantly different from each other in their ability to modulate the voltage dependence of channel activation, with scn1ba_tv <dig> shifting  <dig>  mv further in the hyperpolarizing direction than scn1ba_tv <dig> . both differed from the extent of change in the voltage-dependence of activation mediated by scn1b . the half voltage of inactivation for scn8aa co-expressed with scn1ba_tv <dig> was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, a shift of - <dig>  mv compared to scn8aa alone . for scn8aa plus scn1ba_tv <dig>  the voltage dependence of inactivation was - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, representing a shift of - <dig>  mv compared to scn8aa alone . zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> were not significantly different from each other in their ability to modulate the voltage dependence of channel inactivation , however both differed from the extent of change in the voltage-dependence of inactivation mediated by scn1b . interestingly, and in contrast to scn1b, neither zebrafish subunit resulted in complete channel inactivation, suggesting that the zebrafish subunits modulate na+ channels differently than β <dig> subunits expressed in higher vertebrates.

we next examined the recovery time course of scn8aa inactivated by a  <dig> msec-long conditioning pulse to  <dig> mv in the presence and absence of β subunits . we observed that, similar to scn1b, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> both increased the rate of recovery from channel inactivation compared to scn8aa alone. however, in contrast to scn1b, which completely shifted the rate of recovery from inactivation to the fast mode , both zebrafish subunits left a significant percentage of slowly recovering channels. as shown in table  <dig>  the recovery time course for scn8aa alone was best fit with two exponentials, showing that the majority of channels recovered slowly, or not at all, for the duration of the experiment. in contrast, the recovery time course for scn8aa coexpressed with scn1b was best fit by a single exponential, indicating that the fast component of inactivation predominated. for scn8aa coexpressed with scn1ba_tv <dig> or scn1ba_tv <dig>  two exponentials were required to fit the data. for scn8aa and scn1ba_tv <dig>  16% of channels recovered slowly; for scn8aa and scn1ba_tv <dig>  this value was 19%, suggesting again that the zebrafish β subunits modulate na+ channels differently than scn1b.

mean time-course of recovery from inactivation for na+ currents expressed by the indicated combinations of α and β <dig> subunits in xenopus oocytes. recovery time-course was assessed as described in methods.

a common element in the mammalian and zebrafish β <dig> subunits is conservation of the extracellular ig domain. human mutations in the scn1b extracellular ig loop region result in epilepsy  <cit> , suggesting that this region is critical for proper β <dig> function in vivo. na+ current modulation in oocytes depends on the extracellular ig domain of scn1b and does not require the intracellular domain  <cit> , even though this domain contributes to the strength of α-β <dig> interactions  <cit> . zebrafish scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> modulate na+ currents expressed in oocytes differently than scn1b and the ig loop region of the zebrafish subunits contains regions of divergence from the mammalian sequence that may account for these functional differences. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the c, c", f, and g strands are the most different from scn1b, with the most significant differences in the c" region. the c" β sheet is also a site of divergence between the ig domains of mammalian scn1b and scn3b subunits  <cit> , although there is no homology between scn3b and the zebrafish subunits in this region. if the extracellular domains of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are folded similarly to that of mammalian myelin po, as predicted for scn1b and scn3b  <cit>  , then the c" strand is predicted to lie in an accessible region facing away from the α subunit-interacting a/a' face where it may interact with other cell adhesion molecules in the na+ channel complex. in contrast, the g strand, another region of divergence between the zebrafish and mammalian β <dig> subunits, lies parallel to the a/a' face and thus may interact with α. dissimilarities in this region may be responsible for functional differences between these β <dig> subunits in terms of current modulation. most notably, a proline residue located just prior to the g strand  may change the conformation of this region, causing the zebrafish subunits to favor the fast gating mode less effectively than scn1b, as previously suggested for scn3b, that also contains proline residues in this region of the ig domain  <cit> . thus, our results, taken in the context of previous studies, add important new information to the understanding of β <dig> subunit structure-function relationships.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we demonstrate the first cloning, localization, and functional expression of two na+ channel β <dig> orthologs in zebrafish, scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig>  which arise from alternative splicing of scn1ba. we also show, for the first time, the functional expression of a zebrafish na+ channel α subunit, scn8aa. the deduced amino acid sequences of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> are identical except for their c-terminal domains. the c-terminus of scn1ba_tv <dig> contains a tyrosine residue similar to that shown previously to be critical for β1-ankyrin association and β1-mediated na+ channel modulation in mammals  <cit> . in contrast, scn1ba_tv <dig> contains a unique, species-specific c-terminal domain that does not contain a tyrosine residue. immunohistochemical analysis shows that, while the expression patterns of scn1ba_tv <dig> and scn1ba_tv <dig> overlap in some areas of the brain, retina, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle, only scn1ba_tv <dig> is expressed in optic nerve. both scn1ba splice forms modulate na+ currents expressed by scn8aa, resulting in shifts in channel gating mode from slow to fast, increased current amplitude, negative shifts in the voltage dependence of current activation and inactivation, and increases in the rate of recovery from inactivation, similar to the functioning of mammalian β <dig> subunits. in contrast to mammalian β <dig>  however, neither zebrafish subunit produces a complete shift to the fast gating mode and neither subunit produces complete channel inactivation or recovery from inactivation.

na+ channel β <dig> subunits are multi-functional proteins that participate in multiple signaling pathways on time scales that range from msec  to hours   <cit> . we have shown previously, using gene-targeting strategies in mice, that β <dig> expression is critical for electrical excitability in vivo  <cit> . however, the severe neurological phenotype of scn1b null mice has made a detailed analysis of β <dig> function in vivo quite challenging. with the cloning and functional expression of the zebrafish β <dig> ortholog, scn1ba, we are now poised to study the roles of the splice variants encoded by this gene in the development and maintenance of electrical excitability in vivo using a system that is more amenable to rapid genetic manipulation and analysis.
