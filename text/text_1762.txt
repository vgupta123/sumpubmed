BACKGROUND
schwann cells , the main glia cells in the peripheral nervous system, are among a limited number of mammalian cells capable of dedifferentiation. the ability of scs to dedifferentiate is critical to their role in supporting peripheral nerve regeneration. following peripheral nerve injury, scs mount a regenerative response involving coordinated dedifferentiation, proliferation and redifferentiation that supports axonal regrowth and helps restore peripheral nerve function  <cit> . like other cellular processes tightly coupled with cell fate determination and developmental timing control, this sc injury response requires precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. this is achieved via an intricate transcriptional program that maintains the balance between positive and negative regulators of sc differentiation  <cit> . in addition to transcriptional control, recent studies have shown that sc myelination  <cit>  and response to injury  <cit>  are also post-transcriptionally modulated by micrornas .

although the role of individual tfs that regulate sc myelination has been investigated, cooperation and interaction among different tfs involved in the response of scs to nerve damage remain largely unknown. more importantly, how mirnas integrate into the genetic program of tfs to modulate sc gene expression remains unclear. a comprehensive delineation of the tf and mirna regulatory network underlying the sc injury response may shed light on fundamental aspects of sc biology. this information could also help fulfill the therapeutic potential of modulating the sc injury response in a number of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by peripheral axonopathy.

systematically inferring tf and mirna regulatory networks is difficult to achieve by experimental methods and has motivated development of computational approaches. computational tools have been created to construct tf and mirna regulatory networks using information such as gene expression profiling, mirna expression profiling, and predicted tf and mirna binding sites  <cit> . however, most of these tools utilized a subset of these data and few studies have combined all of these datasets to infer tfs and mirna regulatory networks. for example, mir@nt@n  <cit>  uses tf and mirna target prediction but does not use mrna and mirna expression data. moreover, transcriptional regulation of mirnas is often not included due to the challenge in reliable prediction of mirna promoters  <cit> . in addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing  data for tfs experimentally characterize tf regulatory targets and have been combined and co-analyzed with mrna expression profiling data  <cit> , but usually only a small number of tfs were included. multiple chip-seq datasets from independent experiments were seldom compiled and incorporated into computational network inference. these limitations highlight the need for additional tools to systematically integrate genomic profiling datasets to better understand gene regulatory networks that govern complex biological systems.

in this study we developed a computational pipeline, integranet, to infer the gene regulatory network involved in schwann cell response to injury. this network includes tf-mrna, tf-mirna and mirna-mrna regulatory interactions. this pipeline utilizes previously developed and new computational tools to integrate mrna and mirna expression data, chip-seq data, and in-silico tf and mirna target predictions. starting with a set of genes and/or mirnas obtained from expression profiling analysis, our approach initially constructs a network by connecting tfs to genes or mirnas using tf targets identified from chip-seq experiments. this network is then expanded to include additional regulatory targets of tfs and mirnas by using genome-wide target prediction. we apply our computational pipeline to infer the schwann cell injury response network and study the regulatory interactions around egr <dig>  a known key regulator of myelination. furthermore, we study cooperative tf/mirna regulation involved in the schwann cell injury response network. this work demonstrates a systematic approach to integrate multiple genomic datasets and to infer tf and mirna regulatory networks, which may be used to better understand coordinated gene regulation by tfs and mirnas in complex biological systems.

RESULTS
overview of tf and mirna regulatory network inference
we developed a systematic approach, termed integranet, for inferring tf and mirna regulatory networks involved in sc injury response. this approach integrates mrna and mirna expression profiling data, chromatin immuneprecipitation with sequencing  data, and computational tf and mirna target predictions . our approach first identified a set of genes involved in sc response to injury using previously collected mrna and mirna expression data. these genes consist of the initial set of genes included in the regulatory network. briefly, co-expressed gene clusters that were dynamically regulated after sc injury, termed injury response gene clusters , were first identified . tfs and mirnas that were correlated or inversely correlated with the expression profiles of the irgcs were identified as potential regulators of the irgcs . to identify tf-mrna and tf-mirna interactions, for tfs that have available chip-seq data, regulatory interactions between tfs and their targets  were identified using chip-seq peak locations . for tfs that do not have chip-seq data, we performed computational prediction to identify mrnas or mirnas that they regulate . next, mirna-mrna interactions were identified using computational mirna target prediction . all the identified interactions were organized into a regulatory network. this network was further expanded to include tfs that, although not correlated with irgcs, were master regulators of coexpressed genes in each irgc or that were master regulators of mirnas coexpressed with each irgc . similarly, mirnas that were not correlated with irgcs but were master regulators of genes in the irgcs were identified . these additional tfs and mirnas were added to the network as nodes, and regulatory interactions between these regulators and other nodes already in the network were identified using interactions identified by chip-seq data and computational predictions . this final step completed the network inference. each step in this approach to network construction is described in detail in the following sections.

identification of an initial set of genes involved in the sc injury response network
to identify a set of genes that are critical to sc injury response, we analyzed a published gene expression profiling dataset based on a mouse nerve injury model  <cit> . this study showed that core myelination genes were dynamically regulated and had distinct expression profiles during sc injury recovery and development  <cit> . therefore, we performed unsupervised k-means clustering on the published mrna expression data from the nerve injury experiment and from a sc development study  <cit> . of all the genes profiled on the microarray, a total of  <dig>  genes were expressed during at least one time point in the combined expression datasets, and we focused on gene clusters that were differentially expressed after nerve injury and that contained at least one known myelination genes  . as a result, four coexpressed injury response gene clusters were identified . two of these clusters were downregulated immediately after crush and returned to pre-injury levels as the nerve regenertated . the other two clusters  showed a reciprocal pattern of expression. these clusters contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, respectively . the expression profiles of these clusters were similar to the previously identified profiles of myelination and proliferation genes using anchor genes  <cit> .

to better understand the functions of these gene clusters, we performed gene ontology  term enrichment analysis on the irgcs. consistent with initial dedifferentiation/proliferation and subsequent redifferentiation of scs after nerve injury, we found that pgc genes  were enriched for functional categories involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycle and chromatin assembly. mgc genes , on the other hand, were enriched for functional categories involved in sc differentiation, including lipid metabolic process and myelination . the enriched categories in these clusters were therefore consistent with their expression pattern after nerve injury. genes in the four irgcs were used as the initial set of nodes for tf and mirna network inference.

identification of potential tf and mirna regulators in the sc injury response network
transcriptional activators or repressors are likely to be correlated or anti-correlated with the expression of their target genes. thus, to identify potential regulators of genes in the irgcs we identified tfs that were correlated or inversely correlated with the expression profile of each irgc. as a result,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tfs were found to have correlated expression with the four irgcs, respectively. three tfs, cbfb, taf <dig>  and mef2a, were found to have inversely correlated expression with cluster  <dig>  as shown in a recent study, mirna regulators may be anti-correlated or correlated with the expression of their targets, functioning as either a reinforcer or a fine-tuner  <cit> . thus, to identify mirna regulators for genes in irgcs, we analyzed the nerve mirna expression measured before and after crush injury  <cit> . comparing mirna expression profiles with mrna expression profiles, we found that, of the  <dig> mirnas expressed in peripheral nerve,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas were correlated with the expression profile of the four irgcs, respectively .  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were anti-correlated with the expression profile of cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> . overall, this analysis identified  <dig> mirnas that were expressed similar to mgc genes and  <dig> mirnas that were expressed similar to pgc genes . to check if the dynamically regulated mirnas regulate key gene functions involved in myelination, we examined whether genes in the go categories enriched in dynamically regulated irgc genes  were potential targets of the dynamically regulated mirnas. for  <dig> of the  <dig> go categories enriched in irgcs, more than 50% of the annotated genes have a seed sequence match to at least one of these correlated or anti-correlated mirnas . this result suggests that these correlated or anti-correlated mirnas are likely to be regulators of dynamically regulated genes in irgcs.

identification of tf-mrna and tf-mirna interactions using chip-seq data
to find tf-mrna interactions among genes in the irgcs, we first used experimentally validated tf targets characterized by chip-seq analysis. of all the  <dig> tfs identified in the irgcs, we found  <dig> tfs whose genome-wide binding locations had been analyzed in  <dig> independently published chip-seq datasets . to identify more reliable tf-mrna interactions we only used chip-seq peaks that were located between -10 kb and +5 kb from the transcription start sites  of annotated genes.

in addition to identification of tf-mrna interactions, the genome-wide mapped reads of chip-seq data may also be used to identify tf-mirna interactions. performance of such analysis depends on accurate characterization of pri-mirna promoters. several studies have developed computational methods to predict pri-mirna tsss using several promoter features  <cit> . however, given that many of these methods rely on limited experimental datasets, they tend to only predict tsss for a subset of mirnas. to address this limitation we developed a new voting algorithm  for predicting human and mouse mirna tsss, which uses a comprehensive set of transcription-related sequence features . these included mapping of known transcripts/ests, cpg islands, cage tags, h3k4me <dig> marks, and evolutionary conservation. using tssvote’s predicted pri-mirna tsss, we defined the promoter sequences of mirnas as the genomic region between -5 kb and +1 kb from the predicted tss. we used a shorter range compared to the analysis of mrna because mirnas genes are much shorter and 1 kb is usually enough to cover the entire gene and an additional downstream region. we then identified chip-seq peaks of tfs located within these predicted mirna promoters . mirnas that have tf chip-seq peaks in their promoters are deemed as tf targets. overall, using published chip-seq datasets we identified  <dig> tf-mrna and  <dig> tf-mirna interactions for tfs in the irgcs, connecting  <dig> tfs and  <dig> mirnas. these interactions were added to the sc injury response network.

the overall performance of tssvote is difficult to assess due to the limited number of experimentally validated mirna transcription start sites. when the performance of tssvote was tested by a compiled benchmark set of  <dig> experimentally determined human and mouse mirna tsss , tssvote predicted 52% of these test tsss within 500 bp and 81% of them within 2500 bp, outperforming all other currently available methods tested . the predictions of tssvote were further supported by the fact that a large proportion of mirnas  were located within 10 kb from the pre-mirna sequence . furthermore, the mirna promoter sequences  were more conserved than randomly selected intergenic sequences of the same length   and contained significantly more tf binding sites than random sequences  .

additional tf target prediction using genome-wide tfbs enrichment analysis
although chip-seq data of tfs allowed the extraction of experimentally characterized tf-mrna and tf-mirna interactions, this information was only available for a subset of tfs. moreover, because chip-seq experiments might have been performed under different conditions, some transcriptional regulatory interactions critical to the sc injury response may not be identified. to address this shortcoming, we included computationally predicted transcriptional regulatory interactions based on an improved version of a previously developed statistical model for genome-wide tf binding site enrichment  <cit>  . briefly, this approach calculated a binding probability score for each tf-gene pair using all the evolutionarily conserved tf binding sites  in proximal promoters and evaluated a p-value using tfbs permutation . in this study, the model was improved by using a phylogenetic tree-based scoring function to incorporate evolutionary conservation information from more species. using this model, we predicted  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human tf-mrna interactions. by applying this model to the mirna promoters predicted by tssvote  we also predicted a total of  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human tf-mirna interactions. using these predictions, we expanded the regulatory network to include  <dig> tf-tf interactions and  <dig> tf-mirna interactions, connecting  <dig> tfs and  <dig> mirnas.

we validated this computational model for tf target prediction using tf regulatory targets identified by chip-seq experiments. to perform this validation, we compiled a set of  <dig> independent published chip-seq datasets for a total of  <dig> tfs , and we tested if the target genes identified by chip-seq tended to have significantly higher scores for binding among all the genes in the genome, based on a mann–whitney u-test . we found that chip-seq identified mouse and human mrna targets had significantly higher scores in 94% and 93% of the chip-seq datasets, and chip-seq identified mouse and human mirna targets had significantly higher scores in 55% and 64% of the datasets . this analysis showed that our computational tf-target prediction was consistent with experimental results, for both tf-mrna and tf-mirna regulation.

identification of mirna-mrna interactions using computational prediction
the previous chip-seq data analysis and genome-wide tf target prediction identified tf-mrna and tf-mirna interactions. to identify mirna-mrna interactions we performed computational mirna target prediction. a previous study showed that better performance of mirna target prediction may be achieved by combining multiple currently available algorithms in order to reach reasonable specificity while minimizing loss of sensitivity  <cit> . therefore we chose to combine targetscans  <cit>  and pictar  <cit> , which provides higher specificity, with miranda  <cit> , which provide higher sensitivity, to identify targets of mirnas. only targets of mirnas predicted by at least two of these three methods were included in the network construction. using this approach, we identified  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human mirna-mrna interactions. the average number of targets is  <dig> genes per mirna, respectively, which is close to the speculated number of targets per mirna  <cit> . using this result,  <dig> mirna-mrna interactions were added to the sc injury response network.

expanding network to include master tf regulators of coexpressed mrnas or mirnas
up to this step, the tfs included in the regulatory network were identified by their correlation or inverse correlation with the dynamically regulated irgcs. however, master regulators of genes in the irgcs may share a similar expression profile but with a lag time, or they may be constantly expressed throughout sc injury response while being modulated by mechanisms other than transcriptional control. these tfs will be missed by expression correlation-based discovery but could be identified as common regulators of genes in irgcs based on enrichment of their tf binding sites. therefore, we applied a previously developed tool, the promoter analysis pipeline   <cit> , to identify curated tf binding sites that were enriched in the proximal promoter sequences of genes in each irgc. as a result, we found several tfbs significantly enriched in genes in clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> based on a bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of  <dig>   . these tfs included e2f <dig> and nfyc that were correlated with the irgcs and had been added to the network in step  <dig>  remarkably, known functions of these tfs were consistent with the enriched go terms for the corresponding gene clusters they regulate . applying the same analysis to mirnas correlated with the irgcs, we found one tf, spz <dig>  whose binding sites were enriched in mirnas correlated with cluster  <dig>  these master tfs were added to the sc injury response network as additional nodes.

expanding network to include master mirna regulators of coexpressed genes
similar to tfs, common mirna regulators of genes in the irgcs may not have expression profiles that are tightly correlated or anti-correlated with their target genes. these mirnas may be identified by the enrichment of their predicted target genes in the irgcs. thus, for each mirna we calculated the hypergeometric p-value for its target enrichment . as a result, we found  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas with a significant enrichment p-value for clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively . like the search of master tf regulators using tfbs enrichment, this analysis identified three mirnas  that were correlated with the expression of the irgcs. interestingly, mir- <dig>  whose predicted targets were enriched in cluster  <dig>  was not identified using expression correlation with irgcs due to its low expression on microarray. however, qpcr experiments showed that mir- <dig> was indeed expressed in nerve and had an expression profile correlated with mgcs  <cit> . these results showed that analysis of mirna target enrichment may identify mirna regulators whose expression was not correlated or anti-correlated with its targets or mirna regulators whose expression was not accurately measured on microarray.

expanding network to include regulatory interactions for additional regulators
after additional tf and mirna regulators were identified as described above, they were first added to the network as additional nodes. additional tf-mrna, tf-mirna, and mirna-mrna regulatory interactions between these regulators and other nodes in the network were then identified using chip-seq data of tfs  and computational tf and mirna target predictions . the resulting tf and mirna network involved in sc injury response included  <dig> tf-tf,  <dig> tf-mirna, and  <dig> mirna-mrna interactions among tfs and mirnas, connecting  <dig> tfs and  <dig> mirnas .

availability of the integranet pipeline and datasets for network construction
the network construction pipeline we developed in this study including all the raw datasets is available to the public. these include  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human tf-mrna interactions identified by the compendium of public chip-seq data, high quality sets of  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human tf-mirna interactions identified by mirna tss prediction and chip-seq data,  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human computationally predicted tf-mrna interactions,  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human computationally predicted tf-mirna interactions, and  <dig>  mouse and  <dig>  human mirna-mrna interactions predicted by three algorithms. a perl script can take a list of genes and mirnas these data files as input and creates a network in a text format. these data files and the script are available upon request.

comparison to current algorithms for tf and mirna network construction
to test the performance of our approach, we compared the integranet pipeline to currently available methods for constructing tf and mirna regulatory networks, including genmir++  <cit> , mir@nt@n  <cit> , mirconnx  <cit> , magia  <cit>  and edgeexpressdb  <cit> . these methods use similar but different approaches and have different strengths and limitations. of the six algorithms, mir@nt@n, mirconnx, magia and integranet predict all three types of interactions, i.e. tf-mrna, tf-mirna and mirna-mrna regulation. edgeexpressdb only predicts tf-mrna and mirna-mrna but not tf-mirna interactions; genmir++ only infers mirna-mrna interactions using expression profiling data. thus, while edgeexpressdb and genmir++ can be used to predicted particular types of interactions, they are limited in comprehensive inference of comprehensive tf and mirna networks. mir@nt@n, mirconnx, magia and integranet all use a pre-curated/pre-calculated set of tf and mirna targets and combine this dataset with user inputted mrna and mirna expression data. of these four methods, mirconnx allows users to change the weight of the predefined target dataset in network construction, whereas the other three do not provide this option. mirconnx and integranet use sophisticated statistical models to calculate tf and mirna targets, whereas mir@nt@n and magia merely extract information from existing databases. finally, edgeexpressdb uses one human leukemia dataset to generate networks and does not allow users to use their own data to construct regulatory networks.

to benchmark these algorithms, we first compiled a set of known interactions using the genego database . genego includes manually curated regulatory interactions from the literature. using genes and mirnas in our schwann cell injury recovery network, the genego database search returned a network that consisted of  <dig> connections, including  <dig> tf-mrna,  <dig> tf-mirna and  <dig> mirna-mrna interactions. because these interactions were based on previous studies and were only a part of the complete sc injury network, interactions found by computational algorithms but not by genego may not be false positives. also, because genego interactions were found in diverse biological systems and were not specific to schwann cells, genego interactions that were not found by computational algorithms might not be false negatives. for these reasons, it was difficult to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms.

to reasonably test the performance of the algorithms, we adopted an approach previously used to benchmark the performance of mirna target predicting programs  <cit> . we calculated the number of total predicted connections and the number of genego validated connections that were predicted, and we compared these numbers between different algorithms. when interactions of all three types, tf-mrna, tf-mirna and mirna-mrna, were considered, edgeexpressdb and integranet performed better than all other methods . when each type of interactions was considered separately, edgeexpressdb and integranet performed better than other methods in the tf-mrna interactions and mirna-mrna connections , and mir@nt@n performed best in the tf-mirna interactions .

the genego network also allowed us to evaluate the effect of including chip-seq data in integranet. while the performance of integranet without chip-seq data was similar to integranet with chip-seq data in predicting tf-mrna interactions , chip-seq data significantly improved the performance in predicting tf-mirna interactions . predictions of mirna-mrna interactions did not use chip-seq data and thus were not affected.

as a second approach to compare the performance of different algorithms, we calculated for each method the percentage of its predicted interactions that was also predicted by at least one other method . using this benchmark approach, integranet had the highest agreement rate in tf-mrna and mirna-mrna interactions, and mirconnx had the highest agreement rate in tf-mirna interactions. overall, a total of  <dig> tf-mrna interactions were predicted by at least one of the six methods,  <dig> of which were predicted by at least two methods. a total of  <dig> tf-mirna interactions were predicted by at least one method,  <dig> of which were predicted by two methods. a total of  <dig> mirna-mrna interactions were predicted by at least one method,  <dig> of which were predicted by at least two methods and  <dig> of which were predicted by at least three methods. these interactions predicted by multiple algorithms would be good candidates for further study.

the method that has the highest agreement rate in each type of interaction was highlighted in bold.

effect of model parameters on integranet performance
using the genego network, we compared the performance of integranet using different statistical significance cutoffs. the default p-value cutoff for predicting tf-mrna and tf-mirna interactions was  <dig> . we compared the performance of integranet using four different p-value cutoffs, including  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . when predicting tf-mrna interactions, all four cutoffs had similar performance in terms of the ratio between the total connections predicted and the number of predicted genego interactions, with a cutoff of  <dig>  performing slightly better than  <dig>  and  <dig>  . when predicting tf-mirna interactions, a less stringent cutoff of  <dig>  predicted more interactions than a cutoff of  <dig>  as expected but did not predict more genego curated interactions . although this suggested that a p-value cutoff of  <dig>  might be better, this benchmark result was based on a small set of  <dig> genego tf-mirna interactions.

the egr <dig> subnetwork revealed biological insights on regulation of myelination
to demonstrate the utility of the inferred tf and mirna regulatory network, we studied regulatory interactions that involved a known key regulator of sc myelination, the early growth response  <dig>  transcription factor. egr <dig> is required for peripheral nerve myelin formation and maintenance and it is often mutated in patients with peripheral myelinopathies  <cit> . specifically, we defined the egr2-centered subnetwork as direct mrna and mirna targets of egr <dig>  tfs and mirnas that directly regulate egr <dig> and the interactions among them. in the egr <dig> subnetwork, five tfs were predicted to regulate the expression of egr <dig>  two as activators  and three as repressors  . interestingly, nfkb <dig> and fos, which forms the transcription factor complex ap- <dig> with c-jun  <cit>  have been previously associated with sc myelination  <cit>  and dedifferentiation  <cit>  respectively. in addition to tfs, two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were found to target egr <dig>  additional experimental studies confirmed these interactions and showed that these two mirnas contribute to the modulation of the expression of egr <dig>   <cit> . importantly, recent work from our laboratory showed that overexpression of mir- <dig> in scs impaired their ability to form myelin in vitro, thus demonstrating a meaningful biological interaction between this mirna and egr <dig>  note that four of the five tfs regulating egr <dig> expression were also found to modulate some of its targets, hence enhancing the ability of these tfs to regulate the myelination process.

egr <dig> was in turn predicted to directly regulate the expression of the tf hic <dig> and  <dig> mirnas  . these targets were particularly interesting as they may allow egr <dig> to broadly regulate a number of genes and signaling cascades important for sc differentiation. for example, let-7a and let-7f, as well as other let- <dig> family members, are known to interact with a variety of targets to enhance cellular differentiation  <cit> . similarly, the tumor suppressor mir- <dig> has been shown to target the 3’utr of pten and modulate akt signaling, which critically determines the extent of sc myelination  <cit> . these results showed that our method to delineate the genetic networks driving the sc injury response elucidated egr <dig> regulatory pathways that were consistent with current knowledge on the regulation of sc differentiation.

examination of the egr <dig> subnetwork also revealed that egr <dig> participates in a number of potentially important regulatory network motifs  <cit> . in a network motif such as a coherent or incoherent feedforward loop, tfs and mirnas cooperate to reinforce or modulate the transcriptional control of the common target gene. in the egr <dig> subnetwork, egr <dig> was found to participate in feedforward loops involving the tumor suppressor hic <dig> and the mirnas let-7a and let-7f . the expression of hic <dig> is not tightly correlated with egr <dig>  suggesting that the function of this feedforward loop is to maintain the expression level of hic <dig> within a small range. in addition, we uncovered two feedback loops of egr <dig> . in the egr2/hic1/mir- <dig> negative feedback loop, egr <dig> regulates hic <dig>  which induces mir- <dig> to inhibit the expression of egr <dig>  using this feedback loop, egr <dig> modulates its own expression with an oscillatory behavior. when egr <dig> expression is too high or too low, it raises or lowers its own expression level through hic1/mir- <dig>  as a result, egr <dig> expression is maintained within a range. moreover, the expression of the mediator of this loop, hic <dig>  is also closely modulated by the egr2/let-7/hic <dig> loop mentioned above, ensuring the robustness of this mechanism. finally, egr <dig> forms a positive feedback loop with let- <dig> and gabpa. egr <dig> activates let- <dig>  which inhibits gabpa, an inhibitor of egr <dig>  this loop allows egr <dig> to assuage the inhibitory effect of gabpa and increases its own expression. these feedforward and feedback loops cooperate to maintain the expression of egr <dig> within a constant range. together, these egr <dig> network motifs suggest that the cooperation between mirnas and tfs ensures rapid and robust transitions between the distinct differentiation states of scs that are necessary to support nerve regeneration.

tf and mirna feedforward loops in the sc injury response network
recent studies have shown that coherent and incoherent loops of tfs and mirnas are prevalent in the human genome  <cit> . the discovery of feedforward loops in the egr <dig> subnetwork thus raised two interesting questions: whether coherent and incoherent feedforward loops are prevalent in the sc response network, and whether there exists a bias on the usage of coherent and incoherent loops to regulate genes in the sc injury response. to answer these questions, we searched for all the feedforward loops in the sc injury response network, and we analyzed these motifs in the context of the target gene’s expression profile . namely, an incoherent or coherent feedforward loop may target genes that are correlated with the expression of differentiation/myelination genes  or with the expression of proliferation genes , with the participating mirna acting as a reinforcer or modulator . when we categorized all the regulatory loops based on the target gene’s expression and the type of the feedforward loop, we found that there is a significantly higher frequency of myelination genes in the incoherent loops than the coherent loops . in contrast, there is a significantly higher frequency of proliferation genes in the coherent loops than the incoherent loops . these results suggest that in sc injury response, regulation of myelination gene expression tends to be modulated or carefully controlled by mirnas in incoherent feedforward loops, whereas regulation of proliferation gene expression tends to be reinforced by mirnas in coherent feedforward loops. this analysis demonstrated that the inferred gene regulatory networks may provide new insights on the cooperative gene regulation by tf and mirna in complex biological systems.

discussion
in this study, we developed a computational pipeline for tf and mirna regulatory network inference that integrates expression profiling data of mrnas and mirnas, tf regulatory targets derived from chip-seq data, and computational tf and mirna target prediction. our method takes a step-wise, bottom-up approach that starts with dynamically regulated co-expressed gene clusters as the basic network node set and sequentially adds tfs and mirnas and their regulatory interactions to the network. by applying our approach to comprehensive delineation of the gene regulatory network underlying the sc response to nerve injury, we showed that this method allows inference of integrated gene regulation by tfs and mirnas in complex biological settings. our method was able to provide new insights into fundamental aspects of the sc regenerative response, indicating its potential to help elucidate the complexities of biological processes governed by intricate networks of tfs and mirnas.

an important step in our approach was to use available chip-seq data to derive mrna and mirna targets of tfs. while a significant number of transcription factor chip-seq data has been accumulated, only few studies have combined these datasets and used this resource to study transcriptional regulation of mrnas  <cit> , and no studies have co-analyzed these datasets to infer transcriptional regulation of mirnas. this is partly due to the lack of reliable prediction of mirna promoters. our tssvote algorithm incorporates several sequence features that imply transcription start sites and our method does not rely on experimental data that probe promoter usage, which may be dependent on the experimental conditions. testing our algorithm using experimentally validated mirna tss sites showed that the accuracy of our prediction was within 2500 bp in 81% of the cases and the performance was better than current methods . these predicted mirna tss allowed for the identification of chip-seq peaks that were located within mirna promoters. the identified mirna promoters also allowed for the computational prediction of tfs that regulate mirnas . our computational predictions are expected to be more accurate than previously reported methods  <cit>  due to the more accurate mirna promoter annotation and a more robust tf binding site analysis model.

a notable strength of our methods is that it integrates multiple types of experimental and computational data via a modular approach. thus, individual components of the network inference pipeline may be improved or replaced separately, and additional information about tf or mirna regulation may be added to the prediction model. for example, the computational prediction of tf targets may be further improved by incorporating epigenetic information  <cit> . also, additional regulatory mechanisms, such as regulation by non-coding rnas and by rna binding proteins  <cit> , may be added into the network once experimental data or computational prediction become available for these interactions.

the three major components in our pipeline include identification of tf targets using chip-seq data, identification of tf targets using computational prediction and identification of mirna target using computational prediction. all these components use a set of parameters and cutoffs to perform target identification or prediction, and their performance depends on the selection of cutoffs, with a lower cutoff generating more targets and a high cutoff generating fewer targets. while an arbitrary choice of cutoff is inevitable, we attempted to optimize our cutoff selection using independent datasets. for tf targets identified by chip-seq data, the number of identified targets depended on the chip-seq peak calling algorithm and its parameters. this performance of peak calling can be optimized but is beyond the scope of our manuscript. for computational prediction of tf targets, the p-value cutoff was selected and optimized in a previous publication by comparing to an independent study  <cit> . for computational prediction of mirna targets, the cutoff was selected based on a previous estimate of the number of targets per mirna  <cit> .

a key component of our method was the prediction of tf-target interactions by computational models of tfbs enrichment. regulatory networks inferred by large-scale genome-wide prediction methods like ours are often difficult to validate thoroughly and experimentally. however, our prediction method was based on a published statistical model that was validated using multiple datasets, including compiled sets of co-regulated genes and multiple chip-chip datasets  <cit> . furthermore, the improved version of this model was compared to a large set of independent chip-seq experiment data for  <dig> tfs and demonstrated good consistency for both tf-mrna and tf-mirna regulation. in addition, regulatory pathways identified in the subnetwork around egr <dig>  a well known transcription regulator of myelination, are consistent with current knowledge of regulation of sc myelination . remarkably, the post-transcriptional regulation of egr <dig> by two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  identified in our network were validated experimentally using luciferase assays   <cit> . these results suggest that our method produced an informative and reliable regulatory network for sc injury response.

to demonstrate that our network construction method may be used to gain insight on gene regulation and regulatory pathways in complex biological systems, we applied our method to study the tf and mirna regulatory networks governing the sc injury response. this response involves the cycling of scs between distinct differentiation states that support nerve regeneration. proper cycling is accomplished through the reciprocal regulation of genes driving sc dedifferentiation and myelination respectively, through transcriptional control by tfs as well as post-transcriptional modulation by mirnas  <cit> . the importance of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control in the sc injury response as well as the reciprocal nature of the genetic programs driving this process make sc injury recovery an ideal system for studying the cooperation of tf and mirna mediated gene regulation. when we examined the sc injury response subnetwork around egr <dig>  a known key regulator of myelination, we found other regulators previously associated with sc differentiation. furthermore, we found that egr <dig> interacts with mirnas in feedforward and feedback loops, which may be important for modulating the expression of both egr <dig> and its targets.

mirnas and tfs tend to cooperate in coherent or incoherent feed-forward loops, in which mirnas may function as either a reinforcer or a modulator, to control the expression of a target gene  <cit> . in our analysis of network motifs in the sc injury response network, we found that genes involved in proliferation tend to be regulated by coherent loops, where their repression during sc injury response is reinforced by mirnas. genes involved in myelination, on the other hand, tend to be regulated by incoherent loops, where their activation during sc injury response is “fine-tuned” by mirnas . this suggests that fast and precise timing of the activation/inactivation of genes associated with the immature state of scs is most critical for the dedifferentiation of these glia after nerve injury. in contrast, proper remyelination seems not to require as carefully controlled timing of gene expression, but instead depend mostly on achieving precise functional levels of myelin-related proteins. this is particularly interesting because myelin formation and maintenance is very sensitive to gene dosage effects. in fact, both abnormally low or high levels of specific myelin proteins can cause peripheral neuropathy in humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we present in this work a novel approach to tf and mirna regulatory network inference. our approach systematically integrates multiple types of experimental data and computational prediction on gene regulation and thus produces more reliable gene regulatory networks. applying our approach to the sc injury response dataset demonstrates that our method may be used to gain new insight on gene regulation by tfs and mirnas.
