BACKGROUND
sialic acids are distributed in a variety of glycolipids and glycoproteins, often existing at the non-reducing termini of carbohydrate chains. sialic acids play important roles in various biological and physiological events  <cit> . sialic acid is added to the terminal sugar of glycoproteins and glycolipids by sialyltransferase  enzymes. the sialic acid that is added to a galactose  can be bound either to the hydroxyl attached to carbon- <dig> of gal to form an α <dig>  glycosidic linkage, or to the hydroxyl group attached to carbon- <dig> to form an α <dig>  glycosidic linkage. weinstein et al.,  <cit>  reported that the st6gal <dig>  generates a α2- <dig> linkage of sialic acid on the non-reducing, terminal galβ1-4glcnac residues of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. carbohydrate structures containing neu5acα <dig>  residues play critical roles in cell-cell recognition and influenza virus infection  <cit> .

several systems for expression of recombinant proteins are available, based on bacteria  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , insect  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit> . since bacterial system recombinant proteins are often insoluble and inactive, alternative expression systems to obtain soluble and active recombinant proteins are required. insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus have been used for high-level expression of recombinant proteins  <cit> , partly because these insect cells are capable of posttranslational modifications similar to mammalian cells, and because of high-level protein expression. recombinant baculoviruses are used to infect insect cells, such as sf <dig> cells, and recombinant proteins are recovered from infected cells. however, reactor performance, reactor design, and medium development still require improvements to increase the yield of recombinant proteins. for example, serial passaging and preparation of a large amount of recombinant baculovirus for infection of insect cells are drawbacks of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system.

an alternative to the baculovirus expression system is silkworm larvae expression. recently, a b. mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  bacmid system was developed  <cit>  as a shuttle vector that can be replicated in escherichia coli, b. mori cells and silkworm larvae. this enables more rapid gene expression in silkworm than in conventional baculovirus expression systems. moreover, a cysteine protease-deficient bmnpv  bacmid  <cit>  and both cysteine protease- and chitinase-deficient bmnpv  bacmids  <cit>  have been developed for the efficient production of gene products from silkworms. using this bacmid, human igg  <cit> , renin receptor  <cit> , and glycosyltransferase  <cit>  were expressed successfully. the protein expression of these bacmids is higher than that of wild-type bmnpv bacmid because of significant decreases in silkworm liquefaction and proteolytic degradation of expressed proteins.

in this study, we have successfully expressed a functional rat st6gal <dig> in silkworm larvae, established efficient procedures for large-scale purification of the recombinant enzyme. furthermore, a novel synthetic substrate, fluorescently-labelled disaccharide glycoside was chemo-enzymatically synthesized for the st6gal <dig> assay. characterization and identification of n-glycans of the purified recombinant rat st6gal <dig> from the silkworm larval hemolymph are also reported. the recombinant st6gal <dig> was used as a key enzyme for the synthesis of an artificial sialoglycopolymer for potentially blocking influenza virus infection.

RESULTS
expression of recombinant st6gal <dig> in bacmid-injected silkworm larval hemolymph
bmnpv-cp--chi-/st6gal <dig> with bombyxin  signal peptides was constructed for secretion of st6gal <dig> into the silkworm larval hemolymph. hemolymph was sampled at  <dig> – <dig>  d.p.i. and subjected to sialyltransferase activity assay. compound  <dig> was used as a novel synthetic substrate for the fluorescence assay of sialyltransferase . we first investigated the action of recombinant st6gal <dig> on  <dig> and cmp-neu5ac. when recombinant st6gal <dig> was incubated with  <dig> and cmp-neu5ac, it exclusively produced 5-)ethyl β-neu5acα <dig> lacnac  as described in additional file  <dig>  the resulting compound  <dig> was used as an authentic sample for enzyme assays. the st6gal <dig> assay used hplc to determine the fluorescence of  <dig> produced from  <dig> and cmp-neu5ac by recombinant st6gal <dig> .

rat st6gal <dig> was cloned as n-terminal his-, strep- and flag-tagged fusion proteins. when the three fusion proteins were tested in the sialyltransferase activity assay, flag-tagged st6gal <dig>  had the highest expression level, which was  <dig> - or  <dig> -hold higher than that of strep- or his-tagged st6gal <dig> , respectively . no activity was observed in mock-injected silkworm larval hemolymph .

purification of recombinant flag-tagged st6gal <dig> expressed in silkworm larval hemolymph
the purification of flag-tagged st6gal <dig> from  <dig>  ml of silkworm larval hemolymph is summarized in table  <dig>  twofold diluted hemolymph containing  <dig>  units of flag-tagged st6gal <dig>  was saturated with 25– <dig> ammonium sulphate and the resulting precipitate protein was dissolved in  <dig> mm mops buffer  containing  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig>  triton x- <dig>  in this fraction  <dig>  units of flag-tagged st6gal <dig>  were obtained with a yield of  <dig>  after removal of the ammonium sulphate with a sephadex g-25m pd- <dig> column, the enzyme was applied to an anti-flag m <dig> column. most of the sialyltransferase activity adsorbed to the affinity column and was eluted by elution with same buffer containing  <dig> μg/ml flag peptide. in this final purification step,  <dig>  units of flag-tagged st6gal <dig>  was obtained in a high yield of  <dig>  . flag-tagged st6gal <dig> gave a single band on sds-page and isoelectric focusing with an apparent mass of  <dig> kda  and a pi of  <dig>  . the maldi-tof mass spectrum gave a main peak at m/z  <dig> .

characterization of the purified recombinant flag-tagged st6gal1
the optimum temperature of the purified enzyme was determined by performing the standard assay in the range  <dig> to 80°c. maximum activity was observed at 37°c for the purified enzyme. the enzyme was stable below 20°c but was rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 20°c. the effect of ph on the activity of the purified enzyme was studied in various buffers in the range of ph  <dig> to  <dig>  the optimum was ph  <dig> . the purified enzyme was relatively stable over a wide range of ph, and was especially stable in the range of ph  <dig> to  <dig> 

the kinetic parameters for the transfer reaction of fluorescently-labelled disaccharide glycosides by the purified enzyme were determined by hplc assays. the enzyme acted preferentially on lacnac glycoside over lac glycoside. thus, the kcat/km value of lacnac glycoside was 39-fold higher than that of lac glycoside .

hemagglutination inhibition assay with artificial sialoglycopolypeptides
various substances carrying α <dig> -sialooligosaccharide glycosides are known to inhibit hemagglutination by binding to sna lectin  <cit> . we tested the inhibitory effect on hemagglutination by sna lectin of the synthesized α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide, using recombinant enzyme . the α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide prominently inhibited hemagglutination by sna lectin. the affinity of α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide for the sna lectin was 780-fold higher than that of the control fetuin. both the asialoglycopolypeptide and γ-polyglutamic acid itself did not caused any sna lectin-mediated hemagglutination .

discussion
functional rat recombinant st6gal <dig> was expressed using a bacmid system. the amount of recombinant protein secreted from silkworm larvae was  <dig>  u/ml , which was higher than that obtained from other expression systems. for example, the expression level of secreted rat recombinant st6gal <dig> using sf <dig> insect cells was reported as  <dig>  u/ml  <cit> , mammalian st6gal <dig> using yeast pichia pastoris was reported as  <dig>  × 10- <dig> u/ml  <cit>  and bacterial st6gal <dig> using photobacterium damsela jt <dig> cell was reported at  <dig>  u/ml  <cit> . in addition, we produced various n-terminal-tagged st6gal <dig> using our silkworm expression system. flag-tagged st6gal <dig> had a high expression level, which was  <dig> -fold higher than that of his-tagged st6gal <dig> . some investigators have reported the increase of expression levels of recombinant proteins when n-terminal sequences were changed  <cit> . most likely, the polar character of the n-terminal sequence is contributing to the expression level of recombinant protein secreted from silkworm larvae.

the expressed flag-tagged st6gal <dig> was effectively purified by precipitation with ammonium sulphate followed by affinity chromatography. the purified protein reached  <dig> μg/larva . this highly purified enzyme might be used for studies such as nmr or x-ray diffraction. recombinant protein produced by bmnpv-cp--chi-/flag-tagged st6gal <dig> with bx signal peptides infected silkworm, was comparable to native rat liver st6gal <dig> with regard to substrate specificity and stability. flag-tagged st6gal <dig> lacks an n-terminal hydrophobic region found in the wild type protein, as previously reported by  <cit> . the km of the purified recombinant enzyme  against galβ <dig> glcnacβ-r  was similar to that those of rat liver st6gal <dig>  <cit>  . furthermore, recombinant protein expressed in silkworm is n-glycosylated. most  of the n-glycan patterns of secreted recombinant proteins produced in the silkworm larvae were nearly paucimannosidic type structures, such as man3glcnac <dig> or man2glcnac <dig>  . n-glycosylation is known to be responsible for solubility and stability of glycoproteins. recombinant protein expressed using silkworm larvae has a high solubility in buffer. moreover, no significant loss of enzyme activity was observed upon storage for  <dig> month at 4°c.

in addition, we also established a convenient synthesis for fluorescently-labelled lacnac glycoside as a high-sensitivity acceptor substrate for the assay of st6gal <dig> . lacnac and lactose residues were enzymatically connected to 2-ethanol to produce the disaccharide glycosides. recently, we found that endo-β-glycosidase, a kind of cellulase from t. reesei, catalyzes two reaction types, transglycosylation and condensation  <cit> . this enzymatic catalysis was harnessed for the synthesis of spacer-linked lacnac and lactose glycosides. the efficiency of the reaction is not always high, but this method has two advantages: first, the excess of unreacted lacnac substrate, which is a valuable substrate, is recovered by straightforward column chromatography and can be reutilized for synthesis; and second, the o-glycosylation process stereospecifically gives only the β-glycoside without the need for protection or deprotection steps  <cit> . after deacylation of the resulting disaccharide glycosides, the amino function was easily fluorescently-labelled. especially, the use of fluorescently-labelled lacnac glycoside enabled routine picomole assay of st6gal <dig>  furthermore, fluorescently-labelled glycosides with spacer structure containing ether group, such as 2-ethanol have an extremely high solubility in water, as compared with alkyl spacer, such as 5-amino-1-pentanol  <cit> .

we have already reported that sialoglycopolypeptides with γ-polyglutamic acid backbones can be used as a scaffold in the synthesis of multivalent inhibitors of the influenza viruses  <cit> . thus, the recombinant enzyme was applied to the conversion of asialoglycopolypeptide to α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide. the asialoglycopolypeptide was quantitatively sialylated to obtain sialoglycopolypeptide carrying neu5acα <dig> lacnac residues by recombinant enzyme . we tested the inhibitory effect of the artificial α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide synthesized with recombinant enzyme on hemagglutination by sna lectin, as a model of human influenza viruses. the α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide prominently inhibited hemagglutination by sna lectin with a very low concentration  . the α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide displayed 780-fold higher affinities for the sna hemagglutinins relative to the control fetuin .

CONCLUSIONS
the st6gal <dig> was purified, generating  <dig>  mg purified fusion protein from only  <dig> silkworm larvae, with a recovery yield of 64%. the n-glycan patterns of purified st6gal <dig> were found to be approximately paucimannosidic type. the acceptor substrate specificity of the enzyme was similar to that of rat liver st6gal <dig>  by catalytic reaction of this st6gal <dig>  asialoglycopolypeptide was regioselectively and quantitatively sialylated to the terminal gal residue to obtain α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide. the α <dig> -sialoglycopolypeptide selectively inhibited hemagglutination induced by sna lectin, showing about 780-fold higher affinity than the control fetuin. this recombinant st6gal <dig> obtained using a silkworm expression system is a valuable tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of biological and physiological events, such as cell-cell recognition and viral infections.
