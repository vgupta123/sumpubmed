BACKGROUND
canine mammary tumor is one of the most common neoplasms in female dogs. similar to human breast cancer, canine mammary tumor is spontaneous, and the predominant malignant histological type is carcinoma  <cit> . previous studies have shown that estrogen and progesterone receptors , and epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig>  are expressed in canine mammary carcinoma with clinical implications similar to those in human  <cit> . it has been proposed that canine mammary carcinomas may be a suitable model for comparative oncology studies  <cit> .

α-enolase  is a glycolytic enzyme that converts 2-phosphoglycerate into phosphoenolpyruvate in glycolysis and a multifunctional protein that play a crucial role in a variety of biological and pathophysiological processes  <cit> . eno <dig> may act as a stress protein that promotes hypoxic tolerance in tumor cells by increasing anaerobic metabolism  <cit> . eno <dig> may also function as a plasminogen receptor on the surface of a variety of hematopoetic, epithelial and endothelial cells  <cit> . recently, many lines of evidence suggested that eno <dig> might contribute to tumor malignancy  <cit> . upregulation of eno <dig> gene has been observed in several highly tumorigenic or metastatic cell lines  <cit>  and enzymatic activities in breast cancer concluded a role of eno <dig> in tumor progression  <cit> . a bioinformatics study using gene chips and ests databases further supports a correlation between eno <dig> expression and tumorigenicity  <cit> . increased cell-surface expression of eno <dig> promotes cell transformation and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer and cancer of head and neck  <cit> . the expression of eno <dig> has been also reported in pancreatic carcinoma  <cit>  and hepatitis c virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . more recently, higher eno <dig> expression was detected in er+ breast cancer patients compared to er- patients  <cit> . patients with high eno <dig> expression also had a poor prognosis with greater tumor size, poor nodal status, and a shorter disease-free survival  <cit> .

given the epidemiological and pathological similarity between canine mammary carcinoma and human breast cancer, and that canine mammary carcinoma may be a good animal model for the understanding of carcinogenesis and the development of treatment, the present study examined the expression of eno <dig> and assessed its clinical significance in canine mammary carcinoma.

RESULTS
the mean age when tumors were first identified was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years . the mean maximum tumor diameter was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm . of the  <dig> dogs,  <dig> had undergone ovariohysterectomy before presentation for surgical excision of the primary tumor.  <dig> cases  were benign tumors and  <dig> cases  were histologically confirmed as mammary carcinoma.

immunohistochemical analyses revealed that mammary carcinomas have higher expression of eno <dig> as compared to benign tumors . overexpression of eno <dig>  was only identified in 18%  of dogs with mammary carcinoma and none in the benign tumors. moreover, eno <dig> overexpression occurred preferentially in the tumor cells and not the adjacent non-tumor cells in mammary carcinoma . the overexpression of eno <dig> was not statistically associated with clinicopathologic features such as age, ovariohysterectomy, size and grade of tumor, histological classification, location of affected glands, and expression of er, pr, and her <dig>  we employed the same quick score system to quantify er expression, although not statistically significant, a trend toward positive correlation between high expression of er  and eno <dig> overexpression was found . kaplan meier survival analysis showed that cytoplasmic overexpression of eno <dig> correlated significantly with shorter 5-year cause-specific survival in canine mammary carcinoma . because age is strongly related to death, control of the effect of age was accomplished by adding the mean age as a covariate to the multivariate survival analysis. the results of the age-adjusted cox regression model showed that eno <dig> overexpression retained statistical significance on cause-specific survival .

eno <dig> overexpression is defined as a quick score of ≧12

1tumor size measures maximum diameter

discussion
breast cancer comparative oncology that integrates the study of canine mammary carcinoma into studies of human breast carcinoma may be uniquely positioned to take advantage of the epidemiological and clinicopathologic similarities between the two cancers of different species to improve our understanding of breast cancer biology and therapy.

enhanced expression of eno <dig> has been implicated in human tumorigenesis and also used as a diagnostic marker for human lung cancer  <cit> . eno <dig> overexpression was also preferentially identified in human er-positive breast cancer  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the expression and clinical relevance of eno <dig> in canine mammary carcinoma. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that overexpression of eno <dig> was only detected in tumor cells of canine mammary carcinoma and significantly correlated with shorter 5-year cause-specific survival. the results of the age-adjusted cox regression analysis further indicated that eno <dig> overexpression was significantly and independently associated with shorter cause-specific survival. unlike results from human breast cancer study, our findings suggested that er positivity was not associated with eno <dig> overexpression in canine mammary carcinoma. although quantification of er expression with the same quick score system used for eno <dig> revealed a trend toward positive correlation between overexpression of er and eno <dig> . further investigation is required to elucidate whether the molecular events that underlie eno <dig> overexpression in canine mammary carcinoma is er signaling machinery-associated or -dependent as proposed in human breast cancer  <cit> .

the limitations of this study are primarily related to the limited number of cases and its design as a retrospective study which may make collecting complete clinical information difficult. the finding of eno <dig> overexpression in the neoplastic tissue of canine mammary carcinoma and its possible role in the prognosis of this disease is clinically relevant, as eno <dig> expression could be widely determined on routinely processed, paraffin-embedded tissues. moreover, agents with eno <dig> attenuation activity might provide an effective strategy for the treatment of breast cancer for both dogs and human and merit further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
overexpression of eno <dig> occurs in the neoplastic tissue of a subset of dogs with canine mammary carcinoma. the eno <dig> overexpression may be used as a marker for poor outcome in this disease.
