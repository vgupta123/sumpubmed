BACKGROUND
fungi frequently cause deadly infections in immunocompromised patients resulting from hiv infection, cancer chemotherapy, and organ transplantation  <cit> . until the introduction of caspofungin  in  <dig>  antifungal therapy was limited to the use of polyenes , azoles, and flucytosine which have high failure rates during management of fungal infection, while experiencing increasing clinical resistance  <cit> . the echinocandins are a class of antifungal lipopeptides targeting fungi via noncompetitive inhibition of the β- <dig> -d-glucan synthase enzyme complex, leading to glucan polymer depletion in the fungal cell wall and resulting in osmotic instability and fungal cell lysis  <cit> . human side effects to these chemicals are minimal because the target is absent in mammalian cells, and low dosing is used due to the drug’s potent efficacy  <cit> . thus far, three echinocandin-based agents have been approved for clinical use  <cit> . caspofungin, a semi-synthetic derivative of pneumocandin b <dig>  which is a lipohexapeptide produced by the filamentous fungus glarea lozoyensis , was the first member of this class approved for human therapy; its registration was followed by micafungin  derived from fr <dig> , a sulfonated hexapeptide produced by the fungus coleophoma empetri <cit> , and lastly anidulafungin  derived from echinocandin b produced by the fungus aspergillus rugulosus <cit> . the three fungal metabolites share a common chemical structure of cyclic lipohexapeptide with n-acylated to either  <dig> -dimethylmyristoyl  or palmitoyl  or linoleoyl ; their hexapeptide cores differ from each other by modifications on 4-hydroxyproline or dihydroxyhomotyrosine   <cit> . because of their high efficacy, they have become the first-line therapy for the treatment of invasive fungal infections  <cit> .

several cases of in vivo caspofungin resistance have been reported for candida and aspergillus species caused by mutations that reduce the drug sensitivity of the glucan synthase by several thousand-fold  <cit> . a compensatory cell wall remodeling mechanism elevating the chitin content has been found to be associated with caspofungin resistance in c. albicans <cit> . generation of pneumocandin derivatives with more desirable pharmacological properties via medicinal chemistry approaches has proven difficult  <cit> . elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway to pneumocandins is the first step in applying pathway manipulation and biocombinatorial chemistry approaches to engineer new derivatives with broader spectra of activity and improved physiochemical characteristics to meet the challenges of broader efficacy and clinical resistance.

based on the structure of pneumocandin, participation of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase  and a polyketide synthase  are predicted for biosynthesis of the cyclic hexapeptide and the  <dig> -dimethylmyristoyl side chain  <cit> , respectively. previous attempts to clone the nrps and pks gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis from g. lozoyensis have been unsuccessful  <cit> . whole genome sequencing has proven to be an efficient approach in the identification of gene clusters of fungal secondary metabolites, such as pkss and nrpss  <cit> . a recent genomic sequencing project of a pneumocandin b0-overproducing mutant  derived from the wild-type  strain of g. lozoyensis was inconclusive in identifying the pneumocandin biosynthetic cluster due to insufficient genome coverage  <cit> . in this study, we report the elucidation of the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster by genome sequencing of the g. lozoyensis wt strain atcc  <dig>  we also compare gene cluster organization with that of the recently published echinocandin b biosynthetic cluster  <cit> . in addition, analysis of the g. lozoyensis genome revealed a rich repertoire of secondary metabolite-encoding genes that once again illustrates the huge potential for drug discovery from natural products from the fungal kingdom.

RESULTS
the genome characteristics of g. lozoyensis
sequencing of the g. lozoyensis wt strain atcc  <dig> with an 80× genome coverage revealed a high resolution  <dig> -megabase  genome with  <dig> % repeat content. reads were assembled into  <dig> scaffolds  incorporating more than 99% of the total genomic base pairs . the average gene density was  <dig> genes per mb . the  <dig>  putative coding genes were assigned to different functional categories . consistent with previous studies by our group  <cit> , a combined phylogenomic and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that g. lozoyensis belonged the same major phylogenetic lineage as the plant pathogenic fungi, sclerotinia sclerotiorum and botrytis cinerea <cit> , and the wood endophytic fungus, ascocoryne sarcoides, the helotiales  <cit>  . a total of  <dig> predicted proteins were assigned by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database. the top four categories in the kegg functional classification were “carbon metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and infectious diseases” .

strains of glarea lozoyensis have been isolated from water, plant litter or soil samples  <cit> . however, the fungus has never been observed in nature, therefore its ecological role and trophic relationships remain unknown. it has been speculated that the fungus may be a plant or plant litter saprobe for the following reasons  <cit> . the fungus belongs to the same phylogenetic lineage as cyathicula or crocicreas, an inconspicuous group of fungi that are weak parasites, endophytes of living plants or saprobes of senescent plants and plant litter. in the laboratory, the fungus readily colonized and sporulated on sterilized hardwood  <cit> . its asexual sporulation  resembled that of a heterogeneous group of asexually reproducing fungi known as aero-aquatic fungi that often colonize plant debris in periodically inundated habitats  <cit> . several recent studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between the suite of carbohydrate active enzymes  in fungal genomes and their saprobic, parasitic or necrotrophic life strategies  <cit> . such investigations have focused on those cazymes involved in polysaccharide degradation and have contributed to a thorough understanding of the ecological role of a fungus. to infer whether g. lozoyensis might be a biotroph, saprotroph or necrotroph, we analyzed its complement of cazy gene families and genes. the putative cazymes in g. lozoyensis were identified using the cazy annotation pipeline   <cit>  and were compared to a selection of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi . at least  <dig> cazymes in the five principal category families were identified in the genome . this value is similar to the number of cazymes found in known plant cell wall degrading ascomycetes, including the wood-inhabiting endophyte a. sarcoides, but significantly higher than the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the plant biotrophic symbionts laccaria bicolor, epichloë festucae, and tuber melanosporum . a total of  <dig> glycoside hydrolases  in  <dig> families were found in the g. lozoyensis genome, which is slightly less than average compared to other filamentous plant associated ascomycetes  <cit> . likewise, the number of  <dig> glycosyl transferases  in  <dig> families was also comparable to other plant inhabiting ascomycetes . average numbers of polysaccharide lyases , carbohydrate esterases  were found. however, a relatively abundant number of carbohydrate binding modules  were identified. therefore, its complement of genes associated with carbohydrate degradation and metabolism were consistent with those of other plant-associated ascomycetes.

g. lozoyensis genome revealed a rich repertoire of secondary metabolite-encoding genes
to identify the pathways involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites in g. lozoyensis, we searched the genome for genes encoding key enzymes such as nrps, pks, terpene synthase , and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase , which are essential for the biosynthesis of peptides, polyketides, terpenes, and alkaloids, respectively. the following secondary metabolite-encoding genes were dispersed among  <dig> gene clusters: six nrpss,  <dig> pkss, five polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthase hybrids ,  <dig> tss, two dmatss,  <dig> nrps-like, one pks-like, and one chalcone/stilbene synthase gene . in addition to genes encoding the core enzyme, the majority of the  <dig> secondary metabolism gene clusters in g. lozoyensis contained genes encoding other biosynthesis enzymes, transcription regulators, and transporters. for example, about half of the gene clusters contained a gene encoding a zn2/cys <dig> or a c2h <dig> and c2hc zinc transcriptional factor that could control the expression of genes within of its own cluster. also, about 60% of the secondary metabolism clusters contained a gene encoding an abc or a mfs transporter that could export the metabolites produced by the enzymes encoded by the gene cluster .

biosynthetic capabilities of g. lozoyensis
an unexpected feature of the g. lozoyensis genome was its remarkable diversity of polyketide biosynthetic pathways and having at least  <dig> recognizable core pks genes . domain structure analysis revealed eight non-reducing pkss, one partially-reducing pks, four pks-nrps hybrids encoding partially reducing polyketides  <cit>  and  <dig> pkss encoding for highly reducing polyketides, including glpks <dig> and one pks-nrps hybrid  . a phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of the ketosynthase domains  was constructed for the  <dig> pkss and five pks-nrps hybrids in g. lozoyensis and  <dig> functionally characterized fungal pkss encoding the products with known chemical structures . all four fungal-type pks-nrps hybrids  were grouped with similar pks-nrps hybrids, such as those involved in the biosynthesis of the tetramic acids and hiv- <dig> integrase inhibitor equisetin . interestingly the four pks-nrps hybrids were also clustered with the hmg-coa reductase inhibitor lovastatin  which is proposed to be a truncated pks-nrps hybrid  <cit> . glpks <dig> and glpks <dig> were predicted to be non-reducing pkss related to the pkss responsible for biosynthesis of the metabolites mycophenolic acid and citrinin. glpks <dig> and three other g. lozoyensis pkss  were grouped with the pkss of lovastatin side chain   <cit>  and the tetraketide acyl side chain of zaragozic acid a  <cit> . glpks <dig> and glpks <dig> shared significant homology with the t-toxin encoding gene chpks <dig> of cochliobolus heterostrophus <cit> . six more g. lozoyensis pkss  clustered with the hepato- and nephro-toxic fumonisin b <dig> produced by gibberella fujikuroi <cit>  and the solanapyrone sol <dig> pks of alternaria solani <cit> . the previously characterized glpks <dig>  encoding for the biosynthesis of 6-methylsalicylic acid  <cit> , grouped tightly with two other fungal 6-methylsalicylic acid pkss, atatx from a. terreus and msas from penicillium patulum <cit> . glpks <dig> has been previously identified as the g. lozoyensis melanin biosynthesis gene  <cit> , and it clustered with other fungal di- and tetra-hydroxynaphthalene melanin biosynthesis genes, e.g. hypoxylon pulicicidum    <cit>  and colletotrichum lagenarium   <cit> . the ketosynthase sequence of g. lozoyensis glpks <dig> exhibited sequence similarities to genes involved in the biosynthesis of viridicatumtoxin  <cit> . adjacent to the large groups of melanin and conidial pigment genes were the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin pks  from a. nidulans <cit>  and the glpks <dig> from g. lozoyensis. distantly related to the pigment pkss was the a. nidulans orsellinic acid pks protein orsa  <cit> , and glpks <dig> shared the same domain structure with orsa. we speculated that orsellinic acid or related compounds may be produced by g. lozoyensis, and analysis of fermentations of g. lozoyensis confirmed that it produced isolecanoric acid  and pseudogyrophoric acid  in certain culture media . therefore, we propose that glpks <dig> is responsible for orsellinic acid biosynthesis in g. lozoyensis. cluster analysis revealed that a highly reducing pks  was proximal to a non-reducing pks  in the same cluster . this tandem pks structure was similar to that of the pkss responsible for the biosynthesis of resorcylic acid lactones, e.g. radicicol and hypothemycin, and in fact, glpks <dig> appeared to be an ortholog of hpm <dig> and rdc <dig>   <cit> .

nrpss include modules that incorporate amino acids into the final peptide product. each module minimally contains three domains, the adenylation domain , the thiolation domain , and the condensation domain . in addition to its abundant and diverse pks pathways, the g. lozoyensis genome harbored six nrps genes. three nrpss , contained a single module, encoding products with a single amino acid, the other three nrpss , were multi-modular, encoding products with more than one amino acids . gene cluster analysis revealed that glnrps <dig> , glnrps <dig> and one nrps-like genes located in the same cluster flanked by three clavaminate synthases  and mfs general substrate transporter genes . these data indicated that a hydroxylation tetrapeptide product may be formed and excreted. glnrps <dig>  with six modules that encode a hexapeptide product and located in a cluster bordered by various modifying enzymes, was proposed to be responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis . domain analysis revealed that glnrps <dig> had five modules, and module  <dig>  module  <dig>  module  <dig> contain one epimerization  domain respectively. the glnrps <dig> was located in a cluster flanked by one mfs general substrate transporter gene, and thus suggested that a pentapeptide with three d-amino acids may be formed and excreted. thirteen additional nrps-like genes clusters were identified in g. lozoyensis, and some of them were located in clusters flanked by cytochrome p <dig>  methyltranferase and transporter genes, thus indicating some hydroxylation and methylation products may be formed and excreted .

to detect the classes of terpene synthases  in g. lozoyensis, the homologous sequences were analyzed by using blast at ncbi  . the richness of tss, compared to related genome-sequenced fungi  <cit> , revealed a great potential for g. lozoyensis to produce terpenoids. three ts genes  encoded geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase and geranylgeranyl transferase, and indicated these genes may be responsible for diterpene and carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . two genes  encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase and farnesyl transferase indicated that sesquiterpenes may be formed  <cit> . among these ts genes, only three  were located in gene clusters . two dmats genes were found in the g. lozoyensis genome, and one gene  was located in a cluster downstream of another core pks gene glpks <dig>  signifying that a polyketide linked with dimethylallyl tryptophan may be the cluster’s end product.

identification of glnrps <dig> involving in pneumocandin biosynthesis in g. lozoyensis
the lipohexapeptide pneumocandin consists of two key components: a six-amino acid cyclic peptide and a  <dig> -dimethylmyristoyl polyketide side chain  <cit> . even though no such products are currently known from functionally characterized pks-pks hydrids  <cit> , it is reasonable to consider that pneumocandins might be encoded by one of the pks-nrps hybrid proteins. however, in echinocandin b, the lipid side chain was thought to be derived from the cytoplasmic fatty acid pool  <cit> . furthermore, domain analysis precluded the five pks-nrps hybrid proteins from pneumocandin biosynthesis because the hybrids contained only one a-t-c module, which could only incorporate one amino acid residue in the polyketide chain . domain analysis of the six nrps proteins showed that locus glarea <dig> contained a nrps with six a-t-c modules  . therefore, locus glarea <dig> was the only plausible candidate. glnrps <dig>  inferred to be responsible for the biosynthesis of the cyclic-hexapeptide core of the pneumocandins, comprised  <dig>  amino acids and was encoded by a gene with two introns . glnrps <dig> encompassed  <dig> domains grouped into six modules each corresponding to one of the six amino acid incorporated monomers . the first module of glnrps <dig> had a unique t-c-a-t-c domain structure that differed from the other five modules which contained a-t-c domain structures. two bioinformatics programs were used for substrate prediction, and both predicted that the third module encoded for proline  <cit> . however, neither program consistently predicted substrate specificities for the other five modules.

analysis of the pks-nrps gene cluster for pneumocandin biosynthesis
gene analysis of  <dig> kb of dna flanking glnrps <dig> revealed a typical gene cluster for fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis . immediately upstream of glnrps <dig> was the glpks <dig> gene which encodes a pks of  <dig>  amino acids with eight introns . moreover, the pks encoded by glpks <dig> contained a methyltransferase domain that would be required for the biosynthesis of methyl group-containing fungal polyketides; the pneumocandin polyketide side chain contains two methyl groups   <cit> . in addition to glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig>  two other genes in this cluster stood out, glarea <dig> encoding an acyltransferase and glarea <dig> encoding an acyl-coa ligase . labeling experiments at merck revealed that glpks <dig> assembled a myristate from an acetyl starter, whereas methionines provided two methyl groups to form the  <dig> -dimethylmyristoyl side chain  <cit> . although functional characterizations will be necessary to define how each gene contributes to the biosynthetic mechanism, based on the above analyses and those of the echinocandin b and emericellamide pathways  <cit> , a hypothetical model of the pneumocandin biosynthetic pathway can be formulated from the four genes, glnrps <dig>  glpks <dig>  acyltransferase , and acyl-coa ligase . the model predicts that  <dig> -dimethylmyristoyl side chain is released from glpks <dig> as a carboxylic acid that is converted to a coa thioester by the acyl-coa ligase , and then loaded onto the acyltransferase . the polyketide intermediate could then be shuttled to the first thiolation  domain of glnrps <dig>  followed by its acylation to  <dig> -dihydroxyorinithine to trigger elongation of the cyclic hexapeptide. like other fungal nrps and pks gene clusters, the glpks <dig> and glnrps <dig> are positioned within a cluster that contains genes encoding for one or more cytochrome p450s, clavaminate synthase-like proteins , zinc finger transcription factors, and an abc transporter . it has been demonstrated that proline 3-hydroxylase and proline 4-hydroxylase, which are members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase class, can convert proline to 3-hydroxyproline and 4-hydroxyproline  <cit> . two of the four oxygenases  in the gene cluster were presumed to be involved in proline conversion. two cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  were classified in the cyp 512a family by the p <dig> database  which might be responsible for the hydroxylation of the amino acids. these oxygenases were also presumably involved in an oxidative mechanism for the conversion of leucine to methyl proline  <cit> . the putative zinc finger transcription regulator  belongs to the c2h <dig> and c2hc zinc finger superfamily which are dna-binding proteins and transcription factors  <cit> . some members of this family are pathway-specific transcription regulators of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, e.g., rua <dig> that activates the ustilagic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in ustilago maydis <cit> . therefore, the zinc finger protein glarea <dig> most likely regulates transcription of the glpks <dig> and glnrps <dig> genes. abc transporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins with the ability to pump a variety of substrate specificities of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds  <cit> . the abc transporter  in the cluster possibly secretes antifungal pneumocandins, thus avoiding of intracellular accumulation and ameliorating the toxicity to the producing cells.

finally, a putative biosynthetic pathway for l-homotyrosine, the non-proteinogenic amino acid in the pneumocandin peptide core’s fourth position, sits downstream of glnprs <dig> . this set of five contiguous genes showed significant identity to the l-homotyrosine pathway of e. rugulosa <cit>  , although the direction of transcription was inverted in two of the five genes, and consisted of glarea <dig>  an aconitase , glarea  <dig>  an isopropyl malate dehydrogenase , glarea <dig>  a 2-isopropyl malate synthase , and glarea <dig>  an aminotransferase , and glarea <dig>  a non-heme dioyxgenase . however, unlike the l-homotyrosine pathway of e. rugulosa, the cytochrome p <dig> oxygenase gene corresponding to hytf, was absent .

functional analysis of glpks <dig> and glnrps <dig> in pneumocandin biosynthesis
to verify whether the gene cluster was responsible for pneumocandin biosynthesis, glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig> were knocked out by homologous replacement with an agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocol developed previously for g. lozoyensis, and the deletions were verified by pcr analysis . twelve and ten positive transformants were recovered for the glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig> knockouts, respectively. after growing the fungi in fgy medium and comparative analysis of the extracts by hplc-ms using purified pneumocandin b <dig> as a standard, the two major pneumocandins  were produced by the g. lozoyensis wt strain as expected, but the pneumocandins were absent in the glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig> knockout mutants . consistent with earlier observations  <cit> , the wt strain produced pneumocandin a <dig> in larger quantities than pneumocandin b <dig> . antifungal assays showed that crude extracts from the wt strain caused zones of inhibition against the yeast c. albicans, whereas the crude extracts from mutants Δglnrps <dig> and Δglpks <dig> were inactive . these results demonstrated that both glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig> were essential for biosynthesis of the pneumocandin core structure as predicted.

discussion
sequenced genomes are yielding substantial evidence for a richness of secondary metabolite pathways among the major kinds of fungi, well beyond that imagined to date, and the number of sequenced genomes is growing exponentially  <cit> . with the advance of next-generation sequencing technology, genome sequencing is evolving as an essential tool to decipher novel genes and gene clusters involved in biosynthesis of different metabolites in fungi  <cit> . for example, the biosynthetic pathway of the insecticidal cyclodepsipeptide destruxins was recently elucidated in the insect fungal pathogen metarhizium robertsii by genomic sequencing  <cit> . genomic mining of several aspergillus spp. has led to the elucidation of biosynthetic pathways of multiple bioactive compounds, including terrequinone a  <cit> , emericellamide  <cit> , aspyridones  <cit> ,pyripyropene a  <cit>  and echinocandin b  <cit> .

genomic sequence analysis showed that g. lozoyensis has the potential to produce a diverse array of natural products. the genome was predicted to encode  <dig> gene clusters that contribute to its secondary metabolome, significantly higher than that of a. sarcoides, also of the helotiaceae  <cit> , and in the same order of magnitude as that of b. cinerea, s. sclerotiorum, and other sequenced leotiomycetes  <cit> . most of the ketosynthase domains of the  <dig> pkss and five pks-nrps hybrids could be clustered with pkss that were responsible for the biosynthesis of bioactive polyketides and polyketide-nonribosomal peptide hybrids . however, biosynthetic functions for only two of the  <dig> secondary metabolite-encoding genes in g. lozoyensis were previously validated   <cit> . many secondary metabolites are fusions of nonribosomal peptides and polyketides, in which a pkss and nrpss interface and contribute to the same pathway end product  <cit> . because the nrps portion in each of the five pks-nrps hybrids in g. lozoyensis genome contains only one a-t-c module, one amino acid is predicted to be added to the polyketide produced by the pks portion of the cluster, similar to apda in a. nidulans and ateg <dig> in a. terreus, which are involved in the biosynthesis of aspyridones and flavipucine, respectively  <cit> .

comparing the rich genetic potential for secondary metabolites in the g. lozoyensis genome, only pneumocandins were previously identified from the fungus. in an attempt to find additional chemistries, we identified isolecanoric acid and pseudogyrophoric acid as two new fermentation products of g. lozoyensis . therefore, majority of the secondary metabolites in g. lozoyensis remain to be characterized. despite the advances in the field of microbial secondary metabolite biosynthesis, how the basic biology, ecology, and trophic strategies of microorganisms relate to their secondary metabolite production remains poorly understood. application of efficient strategies to mine the metabolite-encoding gene clusters in g. lozoyensis and other poorly known fungi, while identifying their corresponding metabolites, presents a challenge and opportunity for natural products discovery.

glnrps <dig> and glpks <dig> are centrally located in the pneumocandin biosynthetic gene cluster, and how they cooperate with other genes in the cluster is still speculative. even though they are independently transcribed and translated, their transcription is likely to be synchronized or co-regulated. the first module in glnrps <dig> has a unique t-c-a-t-c structure, and the first t domain in the t-c-a-t-c module is suggest to accept thiolated intermediates as found in emericellamide biosynthesis  <cit>  or adenylated substrates similar to yersiniabactin biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, the first t domain in the t-c-a-t-c module of glnrps <dig> could be responsible for accepting the incoming  <dig> -dimethylmyristoyl side chain intermediate, whereas the second t domain would accept the  <dig> -dihydroxyornithine adenylated by the module’s a domain. threonine, 4-hydroxyproline,  <dig> -dihydroxyhomotyrosine, 3-hydroxyglutamine and 3-hydroxyproline/3-hydroxy-4-methylproline would be sequentially added to the growing chain consistent with the in silico prediction that the a <dig> in glnrps <dig> is specific to proline  <cit> . like many other nrpss  <cit> , the carboxyl terminal of glnrps <dig> lacks a thioesterase  domain, suggesting that a dedicated te is not required for pneumocandin cyclization. the last c domain of glnrps <dig> is proposed to be responsible for cyclization by condensation to form the peptide bond between  <dig> -dihydroxyornithine and 3-hydroxyproline/3-hydroxy-4-methylproline. this proposal is consistent with the fact that the c domain has a haeyd motif similar to the active site signature in the terminal c domain of cyclosporine synthetase  which is responsible for cyclization of cyclosporine in tolypocladium inflatum and siderophore synthase sidc  involved in cyclization of the siderophore ferricrocin in a. nidulans <cit> . the proposed biosynthetic sequence also parallels that proposed for echinocandin b  <cit> . five of the six amino acids in the cyclic hexapeptide were hydroxylated, and hydroxylations of the two proline residues in pneumocandin b <dig> were catalyzed by a proline-3-hydoxylase and a proline-4-hydoxylase  <cit> . the enzyme responsible for hydroxylation of 4-methylproline derived from leucine in pneumocandin a <dig> may also be a proline 3-hydroxylase as 4-methylproline is an analogue of l-proline  <cit> .

other genes downstream of the glnrps <dig> that are likely involved the biosynthesis are the putative acyl-coa ligase glarea <dig> which shares 43% identity with easd which converts polyketide carboxylic acid to a coa thioester in emericellamide biosynthesis in a. nidulans <cit> . the putative acyltransferase glarea <dig> in the cluster shares more than 65% identity with the cholesterol acyltransferases from cordyceps militaris <cit> . existence of these two genes suggests that the polyketide intermediate was first synthesized by glpks <dig>  and then shuttled to the first t domain of glnrps <dig> mediated by the two enzymes, in a fashion similar to the emericellamide biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . surprisingly and unlike the echinocandin b pathway  <cit> , the putative pathway for the homotyrosine residue of the pneumocandin peptide core also sits downstream, and presumably l-homotyrosine biosynthesis is synchronized with the rest of the pathway.

the pneumocandin and echinocandin b pathways have some striking commonalities, yet obviously differ in their organization. the most obvious similarity is the high degree of identity between ecda and glnrps <dig> , and both have the same orientation in transcription and functional modules . likewise, the genes of the l-homotyrosine pathway are highly similar, although their physical proximities to the core nrps differ. both pathways also contain a number of oxygenases that, in the case of echinocandin b, tailor the multiple hydroxyl or diol groups of the amino acid core, but once again their physical location and order are significantly rearranged. however, the inclusion a pks for side chain biosynthesis and its proximity for immediate loading onto the first thiolation domain, along with close proximity of the l-homotyrosine gene cluster and a possible zinc finger regulatory protein would likely confer greater metabolic autonomy to the pneumocandin pathway. the remarkable similarity between the echinocandin and pneumocandin pathways and especially the high degree of sequence homology between the amp-binding domains of glnrps <dig> and ecda raises questions about pathway acquisition through horizontal gene transfer among fungi  <cit> . however, with only two echinocandin type pathways characterized thus far, speculation on why fungi from evolutionary lineages, eurotiomycete  versus leotiomycete  that diverged 100s of millions of years ago, would share or converge on such similar molecular scaffolds is still premature. elucidation of additional echinocandin type pathways in the eurotiomycete, e.g., aculeacin and mulundocandin, and in the leotiomycetes, e.g. fr <dig>  and cryptocandin would yield evidence to determine a possible echinocandin progenitor and the probable directionality in gene recruitment or losses during the evolution of the echinocandin-pneumocandin gene clusters, as well as the significance of these potent cell wall-modifying metabolites to the fungi that produce them.

elucidation of the pneumocandin biosynthetic pathway in g. lozoyensis paves the way for designing experimental procedures to enhance the production titer of the pneumocandins or engineering analogues with improved oral availability or broader spectrum of antifungal activities. deletion of other pks and nrps genes could potentially reduce metabolic competition for substrates to glpks <dig> and glnrps <dig> and therefore increase the titers of pneumocandin b <dig>  in a manner similar to the disruption of glpks <dig> melanin gene in g. lozoyensis which doubled pneumocandin production titer  <cit> . elimination, inactivation, addition or modification of the specificity of domains to glpks <dig> and glnrps <dig> could result in new pneumocandin derivatives via biocombinatorial chemistry approaches for the discovery and development of improved antifungal therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
the glarea lozoyensis genome was sequenced, completely assembled and thoroughly annotated. the menu of secondary metabolites encoding genes was predicted from the genome, thus providing a greater understanding the complexity of primary and secondary metabolism in fungi from the yet poorly studied leotiomycetes. the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin was predicted in silico and identified by core gene glpks <dig> and glnrps <dig> knockouts and bioassay experiments. the data from this study will form the basis for a more detailed functional analysis of pneumocandin biosynthetic pathways and enable the identification of other antifungal lipohexapeptide pathways in other fungi, of which both will be essential for increasing pneumocandin production and for generating new pneumocandin and echinocandin derivatives via biocombinatorial chemistry approaches.
