BACKGROUND
bread wheat  is among the world’s most important crops, occupying 17% of all cultivated land and supplying about 55% of carbohydrates for human consumption  <cit> . however, its very large , polyploid and repetitive genome presents major challenges to genome sequencing. t. aestivum is an allohexaploid derived from serial hybridization events between three different diploid wheat ancestors with a, b and d genomes  <cit> , resulting in each of its  <dig> chromosomes being present in  <dig> phylogenetically related but divergent sub-genomes . therefore, many genetic features have  <dig> homoeologous variants, some of which may not be functional. over the last few years, through the development of high-throughput next generation sequencing  technologies, the sequencing of very large genomes has become increasingly feasible; however, the assembly of these sequence reads particularly from the highly repetitive regions remains challenging. in the case of bread wheat, the international wheat genome sequencing consortium  has developed a roadmap for sequencing projects  <cit> , using flow sorting techniques to isolate individual chromosomes and chromosome arms. this strategy has been used to produce chromosome-specific bac  libraries for genomic studies  <cit> , such as bac-end sequencing  of chromosome 3b and the long arm of chromosome 1a, which provided initial samples of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the sequences of these chromosomes  <cit> . following these studies, shotgun sequencing at relatively low coverage has been used to generate comprehensive surveys of large grass genomes, including in-depth exploration of gene content and organization. this approach was first demonstrated by mayer et al. <cit> , who characterized barley chromosome 1h, tagging  <dig>  genes and, by exploiting synteny with rice and sorghum sequences, ordering  <dig>  of these into a virtual gene map. this was subsequently extended to the whole barley genome  <cit> ; in the meantime, similar sequence surveys have been reported for t. aestivum chromosomes 4a , 5a, 6b & 7bs, and a comparison of the homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes from both species . each of these studies has enabled the eludication of the structure of the respective chromosome in much greater detail than it was previously possible. in addition, utilizing  <dig> sequencing technology, the entire t. aestivum genome has been sequenced to a 5× coverage; from which several low copy number sequences and gene models based on orthologous sequences from other grass species were proposed  <cit> . very recently, the iwgsc released illumina survey sequences and predicted gene models from each individually flow-sorted chromosome arm  <cit> . while these studies have considerably contributed to our understanding of the wheat genome on a global scale and the draft sequences generated so far greatly benefit the wheat research community, the ultimate goal of a complete and reference-quality genome sequence still requires much additional work. to date, only chromosome 3b has been sequenced to this standard, using a bac-by-bac approach  <cit> ; efforts are ongoing to extend our knowledge of the rest of the wheat genome.

the modern bread wheat genome is thought to have arisen from the hybridization of the d sub-genome with the ancestral tetraploid wheat during the establishment of modern agriculture, possibly as recently as ~ <dig>  years ago  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis also places the divergence of the d-genome from its nearest diploid relative  more recently than that of the a or b genomes  <cit> . as relatively few ae. tauschii genotypes were involved in the origin of t. aestivum <cit> , the d-genome is typically lacking in genetic diversity and polymorphism, resulting in fewer loci on available genetic maps  <cit> , although the d genome is also therefore a natural target for introgressing desirable traits from ae. tauschii. chromosome 5d, at 748 mb in size  <cit>  comprises  <dig> % of the d sub-genome and  <dig> % of the entire bread wheat genome. this chromosome harbours genes for a number of agriculturally important traits; for instance, grain hardness, the single most important determinant of wheat end-use quality, is controlled by two puroindoline proteins that are expressed from the pina-d <dig> and pinb-d <dig> loci located close to the short arm telomere of 5d  <cit> . vernalization and flowering time habits, which are vital for the adaptation of wheat to different climates, depend on at least  <dig> vrn loci,  <dig> of which have homoeologs on chromosome 5d; mutations in both vrn-d <dig> and vrn-d <dig> have been shown to influence vernalization  <cit> . there are also several disease response loci that have been mapped to 5d, of which only the leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig> has been cloned so far  <cit> .

in this study, we carried out shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted bread wheat chromosome 5d using  <dig> technology, thereby providing a complementary dataset to the previously published whole genome shotgun  <cit>  and chromosome-by-chromosome illumina survey sequences  <cit> . we assembled a catalogue of genes present on 5d and exploited synteny with other grass genomes to place  <dig> into a virtual gene order, enabling us to assess the consistency of ngs sequence surveys and suggest refinements to the existing data. we also highlight structural and evolutionary features of chromosome 5d, including gene duplications and translocations and large-scale chromosome rearrangements. these observations will be valuable for cloning of important trait genes and the future mapping and reference-quality sequencing of chromosome 5d.

RESULTS
isolation and survey sequencing of wheat chromosome 5d
the short and long arms of chromosome 5d  were isolated from double ditelosomic lines . the purity of the dna was estimated to be  <dig> % for 5ds and  <dig> % for 5dl, the impurities consisting of fragments from other chromosomes. as the isolation of sufficient dna for direct sequencing is prohibitively resource and time-consuming, the sorted telosomes were amplified by multiple displacement amplification  giving yields of  <dig>  μg  and  <dig>  μg . these dna were fragmented and each telosome was sequenced using roche/ <dig> titanium technology to give  <dig>  –  <dig>  fold coverage .table  <dig>

sequence assembly and detection of repetitive elements
previous studies have suggested that bread wheat chromosomes consist of 80-90% repetitive elements, the majority of which belong to the long terminal repeat  class of retrotransposons  <cit> . ltr elements can be several kilobases long, making accurate de novo sequence assembly impossible from reads of 300–400 nt, particularly at low chromosome coverage. therefore, a combination of assembly and sequence similarity methods were utilized to identify transposable elements  and other repetitive sequences . a summary of all repeat families identified is given in additional file  <dig>  after eliminating all detected repetitive elements, the remaining non-repetitive sequence reads had a total length of  <dig>  mb for 5ds and 201 mb for 5dl; these were used for all the following sequence comparisons and gene searches.table  <dig>

discovery of orthologous gene sequences on chromosome 5d
the masked and filtered sequence reads produced above were examined for potential gene coding sequences by similarity searches against all predicted proteins from the sequenced grass genomes , a subset of uniprot containing only monocotyledon proteins, and unigenes derived from all available t. aestivum, hordeum vulgare, panicum virgatum, saccharum officinarum, and zea mays ests . after removing low quality alignments and amplification artifacts, the hits to each dataset were combined, and  <dig>  reads from 5dl and  <dig>  from 5ds were found to match a gene coding sequence from at least one of the databases . notably,  <dig>   and  <dig>   of the reads from 5ds and 5dl, respectively, yielded a match in only one of the databases; whereas only  <dig>  of reads from 5ds and  <dig>  of reads from 5dl matched all  <dig> sequenced grass genomes. these observations suggest that 5dl contains a higher proportion of conserved genes than 5ds, which shows greater divergence from other grass species in terms of orthologous genes. these sequences may include contaminating fragments from other chromosomes, however, the total length of such fragments would give only a  <dig> × coverage of the rest of the genome, making it highly unlikely that any contaminating gene sequence would be represented by more than one unique sequence read. therefore, to avoid contaminants, gene sequences which were only matched by a single sequence read were eliminated. additionally, a small number of unigene and uniprot sequences that matched > <dig> reads were excluded as probable repetitive sequences. after applying these quality criteria, the number of unique genes from b. distachyon, o. sativa and s. bicolor with matches to the survey sequences was evaluated . a total of  <dig> genes were found with homologous sequences on 5ds, and  <dig> on 5dl. interestingly, 5ds contained a statistically higher proportion of sequences conserved with brachypodium and rice but not sorghum, and of genes that matched sorghum but not brachypodium . in contrast, 5dl had a much higher representation of genes that matched brachypodium and sorghum, but not rice . matches to the unigene and/or uniprot datasets used provide evidence that a putative orthologous gene sequence is also present in other crop species that have not yet been fully sequenced. it was noted that while only 59% of putative conserved genes on 5ds were supported by unigene and/or uniprot hits, 79% of those on 5dl were. in particular, of putative 5dl genes that were conserved among all  <dig> grass genomes, more than 90% had unigene/uniprot matches, a significantly higher proportion than 5ds . taken together, these results suggest that mutations accumulated within conserved gene sequences may not be distributed uniformly across chromosome 5d, and that the primary sequence of such genes on 5dl has been conserved more than those on 5ds. in addition,  <dig> or more sequence reads matched each of  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigene/uniprot entries, but no predicted protein sequences from brachypodium, sorghum and rice at the same stringency . the great majority of these unigene/uniprot entries were from t. aestivum and h. vulgare, suggesting that these represent gene sequences that have accumulated a large number of mutations during triticeae evolution. these may include both genes with novel functions, and gene fragments/pseudogenes, an issue explored further below . these sequences are hereafter referred to as ‘non-conserved gene-like sequences’; full details of these and all the putative orthologous genes sampled are given in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

trna repertoire of chromosome 5d
a recent study revealed an unusual abundance for putative trnalys genes among repeat-containing sequences from wheat chromosome 6b  <cit> . sequence reads  from both arms were screened for the presence of putative trna gene sequences, and, similarly, an overabundance of putative trnalys species was predicted from unmasked sequence reads, while masked reads did not yield such a dramatic bias in any trna species . this implies that either some repetitive sequences resemble trna gene sequences, particularly for trnalys, or that some genuine trna genes are located inside repetitive regions of the chromosome. the trna gene content of the illumina sequence contigs from t. aestivum group  <dig> chromosomes also exhibited the same pattern for all homeologous group  <dig> chromosomes, indicating that the abundance of trnalys species is a shared phenomenon and is not an artefact caused by different sequencing technologies. consistent with these observations and the conclusions of the previous report  <cit> , it is likely that some trna genes have been captured by tes and co-expanded as the tes proliferated. this would be consistent with a genome-wide expansion of tes containing trnalys after the formation of hexaploid wheat, as chromosomes from different homoeologous groups and ancient origins are equally affected   <cit> . as the te-driven expansion of trna genes located inside the repetitive portion of the genome suggests that many of these putative genes may be non-functional copies, the comparative trna content of non-repetitive sequences from different chromosomes were inspected for any functional differences.figure  <dig>

in order to eliminate the differences in trna gene predictions resulting from the different sequencing and bioinformatics platforms used, previously published  <dig> survey sequences from 5a chromosome  <cit>  were repeat-masked and screened for putative trna genes using the same procedure as 5d. the predicted trna gene density on 5a was almost  <dig>  times greater than 5d . the two homeologous chromosomes not only differ in total trna gene content, but also different trna genes were enriched on 5a and 5d , which may have implications for the translational machinery.

syntenic relationships between 5d and other grasses
the chromosomal locations of all genes from the brachypodium, sorghum and rice genomes with homologues on 5d were used to identify conserved regions of these genomes with each chromosome arm , while matches to  <dig> or more genomes were used to highlight syntenic relationships between the model grasses . 5ds orthologous reads revealed a clear syntenic block, corresponding to the proximal end of b. distachyon chromosome  <dig> , the distal end of s. bicolor chromosome  <dig> , and o. sativa chromosome  <dig>  . immediately adjacent to this block in bd <dig>  another small segment showed high conservation with 5dl; however, genes from this region corresponded to sb <dig> and os <dig> . 5dl also contained a much larger syntenic block on the long arm of bd <dig> that was also syntenic with sb <dig> and os <dig>  and a second major syntenic block containing orthologous genes from the proximal ends of bd <dig> and sb <dig>  which were also dispersed along os <dig>  the previously published survey sequences of chromosome 5a  <cit>  obtained with the same sequencing technology were also re-analyzed using the same criteria applied to the 5d sequences, and the locations of conserved sequences from both chromosomes on syntenic regions of b. distachyon compared . as expected, the regions of 5al syntenic with bd <dig> differed from 5dl in that part of the block at the proximal end of bd <dig> was not present, while a new block was present at the distal end of the chromosome. this difference in synteny reflects the previously documented 4al/5al translocation  <cit>  and no other large scale differences in syntenic blocks were observed. however, there was evidence of fine structure variations within these blocks, which was also displayed in the relationships with the rice and sorghum genomes; for example, a significant minority of the 5dl sequences matching bd <dig> mapped to sb <dig>  not sb <dig> . also, a large number of conserved genes on both chromosome arms fell outside these syntenic regions. a virtual gene order of wheat chromosome 5d was constructed using the ‘genome zipper’ approach  <cit> . first of all, co-linear genes were ordered according to the syntenic regions in b. distachyon. then,  <dig> deletion bin-mapped wheat est and ssr sequences were mapped onto the syntenic gene reads, some of which also had positions on the international triticeae mapping initiative wheat reference genetic map. the resulting gene order and all mapped markers are given in additional file  <dig>  based on these comparisons, 5ds was found to be largely co-linear with a section of bd <dig> from bradi4g <dig> – bradi4g <dig>  apart from a probable inversion including the genes from bradi4g <dig> – bradi4g <dig> . the telomeric region of 5dl, corresponding to deletion bin 5dl <dig>  was predominantly co-linear with the short arm of bd <dig> in reverse order , although a few genes from this region mapped to other deletion bins, giving evidence for several small-scale translocations within this region. the rest of 5dl was syntenic with most of the long arm of bd <dig> . the boundary between segment  <dig> and segment  <dig> on bd <dig> lies between bradi4g <dig> and bradi4g39020; more genetically mapped markers are required to determine the precise boundary between segments  <dig> &  <dig>  and any smaller rearrangements that might have occurred within each deletion bin. the centromeric region of 5dl also contains syntenic sequences from the short arm of bd <dig> , the segment adjacent to the region of bd <dig> that is syntenic with 5ds .figure  <dig>

interestingly,  <dig> small regions from bd <dig>  bradi4g <dig> – bradi4g <dig> and bradi4g <dig> – bradi4g <dig>  were found to contain multiple small groups of genes that were conserved alternately with 5ds and 5dl . these did not appear to be the result of contaminating dna from the opposite arm in the isolated chromosomes, because very few genes were detected in both chromosome arms; also, several est markers bin-mapped to 5ds were found in the latter region, which was expected to be co-linear to 5dl . each of these heavily rearranged segments occurs at a putative breakpoint for a large-scale chromosomal translocation, and is inferred to contribute sequences close to the centromere of 5d.

in addition, the number of b. distachyon orthologous genes mapped to each 5d deletion bin was totalled . across the chromosome approximately 60% of bin-mapped genes were from the syntenic regions of bd <dig> and bd <dig>  while 40% came from other chromosomes. the exception was the telomeric region of 5ds  where only  <dig> % of the mapped genes were syntenic. this was significantly lower than the rest of the chromosome , suggesting that this part of the chromosome contains a much higher proportion of non-syntenic genes.

in order to assess the divergence between different triticeae genomes, the virtual gene order of genes syntenic with b. distachyon identified on each arm of 5d was compared with those previously published for t. aestivum chromosome 5a  <cit>  and h. vulgare chromosome 5h  <cit>  . only 37% of all the syntenic genes found on 5d  were common to all three chromosomes, while 5d & 5h had more genes in common with each other than either of them did with chromosome 5a . this is partly a result of the aforementioned 4al/5al translocation, but there is also a section syntenic with the long arm of b. distachyon chromosome  <dig> that is found near the centromere of 5dl and 5hl but was not found on 5al . similarly a block from the middle of 5dl  seems to be absent from both 5al and 5h. as well as these large-scale variations, many differences involving isolated genes were found along the length of the chromosome. throughout the syntenic regions, genes common to all three chromosomes were interspersed among those found on two or only one of them. in addition, several small-scale translocations were identified in the 5h gene order that have not been detected in 5a or 5d . these differences may be due to the higher resolution genetic markers that were available to construct the virtual gene order of barley than wheat; as more sequence-based t. aestivum markers become available, some of these translocations may be found to be present on 5a and/or 5d as well.figure  <dig>

in summary, these results suggest that syntenic regions form a highly conserved framework for the homeologous chromosomes; however, the subset of syntenic genes found within these regions may vary considerably even between closely related genomes. moreover, the syntenic genes are interspersed with non-syntenic genes that show much greater variation.

wheat-specific genome rearrangements
recently, the comparison of brachypodium, rice and sorghum genes has been utilized to discover genes that might have been ‘moved’ or rearranged specifically in the genome of one of the three species  <cit> . using a similar strategy, all 5d gene sequence reads conserved with all three model grasses but lying outside the 5d syntenic regions described above were analysed further for evidence of possible wheat-specific rearrangements. as above, genes matched by a single read were not considered; among the remaining non-syntenic genes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were found to be conserved between 5d and all  <dig> grass genomes, corresponding to  <dig> &  <dig> sequence reads, respectively. pseudogenes or gene fragments are less likely to be covered evenly by sequence reads than true genes, so, these non-syntenic genes were further examined as follows: genes covered by  <dig> or more sequence reads were visually examined for even coverage, while genes covered by only  <dig> or  <dig> sequence reads were divided into  <dig> or  <dig> equal length segments, and considered as genuine genes only if at least one read overlapped with each segment . using these criteria,  <dig> and  <dig> non-syntenic, putatively ‘genuine’ genes were identified for 5ds and 5dl, respectively. among these, non-syntenic genes that are syntenic between the other three grass genomes  points to a probable wheat-specific genome rearrangement, which occurred after the triticeae and the fully sequenced grasses diverged from their common ancestor. for instance,  <dig> sequence reads from 5ds matched bradi1g <dig>  os02t <dig> and sb04g <dig>  homologous genes from regions which are syntenic with each other but not with t. aestivum 5d. thus, these  <dig> sequences are presumed to represent a wheat homologue that was translocated to chromosome 5d, after wheat diverged from its common ancestor with brachypodium. twenty-two and  <dig> such genes from 5ds and 5dl respectively are proposed to have resulted from such wheat-specific rearrangements . the possible functions of these genes, predicted from the respective brachypodium protein sequence, include proteins related to transcriptional and translational machinery, along with several hypothetical proteins.

5d gene modelling and annotation
in order to model the coding sequences of genes identified here, and enable comparison with other t. aestivum gene datasets, the coding sequences of the genes homologous with 5d from brachypodium, sorghum and rice were used as a reference on to which the non-repetitive 5d reads were assembled using gsmapper . multiple contigs mapping to different parts of the same reference were merged to give a single gene model, with gaps filled with runs of ‘n’. similarly, unigene and uniprot entries were used as a reference to assemble the non-conserved gene-like sequence reads. previously published t. aestivum transcriptome sequences  <cit>  were then mapped to all models, which were assigned a confidence value based on the proportion of bases mapped by transcriptome sequences. this yielded a total of  <dig> high-confidence gene models ,  <dig> from 5dl and  <dig> from 5ds. a further  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene models, classed as ‘low-confidence’, had 20-60% transcript coverage. all remaining models were eliminated as probable gene fragments and pseudogenes. generally speaking, a similar proportion of conserved genes and non-conserved gene-like sequences from both arms were supported by the transcriptome data, suggesting that many of the latter do represent functional genes. interestingly, 5ds included relatively more gene models derived from non-conserved sequences than 5dl, especially among the low confidence models . assembly and transcriptome mapping statistics and sequences of all the high- and low-confidence gene models are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

two genome-wide ngs datasets have recently been released for t. aestivum, one from whole-genome shotgun  <dig> sequences  <cit>  and the other from chromosome-specific illumina sequences  <cit> . the gene models assembled from each are an extremely valuable resource for wheat researchers, although both groups state that these are draft sequences that will be improved by subsequent studies. the data presented in this paper represents a hybrid between the two, as it was generated from chromosome-specific  <dig> sequences. therefore, we examined the consistency of the gene model sequences derived from all three studies by similarity searches, using a best reciprocal hit strategy with a minimum sequence identity of 95%. for all gene models that found a match, the sub-genomic/chromosomal locations to which their counterparts were assigned was compared, the distribution of which is shown in figure  <dig>  of the gene models produced from our data,  <dig> out of  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  matched a model from the whole genome shotgun sequences. the number of matches to illumina sequences was slightly lower on 5dl  but markedly so on 5ds . this difference could be partly explained by the fact that we used the same transcriptome data as the former study to confirm our gene models, but may also illustrate differences between the sequencing technologies and assembly pipelines used. the distribution of sequence identities was similar for both external datasets, although there was a higher proportion of 100% identical matches between our data and the previously reported  <dig> shotgun sequences, whereas more hits with the iwgsc data were found in the  <dig> - <dig> % identity range. these differences reflect the fact that illumina sequencing was used for the latter study, and shows that  <dig> sequences are more likely to be consistent with each other, as each technology is prone to different kinds of sequence errors. the chromosome 5d gene models mostly matched models that were assigned to the d genome in the previous  <dig> study, although there were also a significant number that were unmapped but can now be assigned to 5d . similarly, in comparison with the iwgsc study, the majority of our gene models matched an illumina gene model from the same chromosome arm, with 5ds slightly more consistent than 5dl, although some gave matches to other chromosomes even at 100% identity . also, for best hits with <98% identity, more than half were found on chromosomes other than 5d. these likely correspond to gene copies with slightly different sequences on other chromosomes; accordingly, it has previously been observed that homoeologs can be up to 99% identical with each other  <cit> . more best hits were found on 5b  than 5a , in contrast to the whole genome shotgun data, where a number of best hits were previously mapped to one of the other sub-genomes .figure  <dig> 
screening of gene models against other ngs datasets. high- and low-confidence gene models from 5ds and 5dl were searched independently against gene models derived from a. whole genome shotgun  <dig> sequences  <cit>  and b. chromosome-specific illumina contigs  <cit> . each bar of the histogram shows the % of all gene model hits for each comparison in a 1% sequence identity bin, starting from the value shown on the x-axis .



all the gene models built from both conserved orthologous genes and unigene/uniprot sequences were also annotated for putative functions by assigning gene ontology  terms from homologous sequences. the assignment of go terms to each chromosome arm was largely similar, and, the most abundant terms found in each of the  <dig> ontologies are summarized in figure  <dig>  some quantitative differences were observed between the terms assigned to conserved gene models and non-conserved gene-like sequences; for example, among biological process terms, ‘generation of precursor metabolites and energy’ was significantly enriched in non-conserved gene-like sequences  and similar to the mitochondrion-related annotations among cellular component terms , suggesting that chromosome 5d might have evolved genes with novel energy-related functions after the divergence of triticeae tribe. conversely, ‘plasma membrane’ annotations were more prominent among conserved gene models than non-conserved gene-like sequences. finally, among molecular function terms, ‘nucleotide binding’, ‘hydrolase activity’ and ‘rna binding’ were enriched in non-conserved gene-like sequences. in particular, ‘hydrolase activity’ annotations were exclusively derived from these non-conserved sequences at high statistical significance . the sequences of genes that have previously been cloned from chromosome 5d were also searched for in our dataset. as shown in table  <dig>  the important pina-d <dig> and pinb-d <dig> genes on 5ds, and vrnd <dig> and lr <dig> on 5dl, were matched by several sequence reads covering 50-100% of the gene sequence and distributed along the length of the genes , confirming their presence on these chromosome arms. in contrast only fragments were found of the adh1d gene that has previously been mapped to 5dl  <cit>  and the vrnd <dig> sequence from ae. tauschii, suggesting that these genes may not be actually present on t. aestivum 5d. lr <dig> gave a higher depth of coverage than expected , indicating that there may be  <dig> or  <dig> genes with highly similar sequences on this chromosome arm. many rrna genes are present in multiple copies and likely to be masked as repeats; therefore, these gene sequences were also searched for in the unmasked reads. for the protein coding genes mentioned above no additional matching reads were found, but the 5s-rna-d <dig> gene and the nucleolus organising region  were detected at high depths of coverage.figure  <dig>

a significant proportion of all human nutrition, either directly as a staple food or indirectly via use as animal feed, is provided by grasses of the poaceae family, such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice, maize, sorghum, millet and sugarcane. bread wheat  is arguably the most important of these species, but has one of the largest and most complex genomes. with the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing technologies at reduced costs, a number of groups have reported sequence surveys of individual chromosomes, along with two genome-wide surveys, both by a whole-genome shotgun strategy  <cit>  and, very recently, by illumina sequencing of isolated chromosomes  <cit> . these surveys have great value for identifying putative protein-coding genes and, with the help of genetic mapping and synteny analysis, creating a virtual order of conserved genes along each chromosome, as first described in barley  <cit> . however, these studies acknowledge that the sequence data accumulated so far is of draft quality, which may contain errors and omissions to be resolved by subsequent studies.

as such, the data presented here provides an independent assessment of the structure and evolutionary features of chromosome 5d. repetitive sequences, identified by a combination of sequence similarity and read depth comparisons, comprised  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the cumulative length of reads from 5ds and 5dl respectively . these values are within the range reported in similar surveys of other chromosome arms  <cit>  although a little lower than was observed in fully assembled bac sequences from chromosome 3b .

putative trna genes predicted from unmasked and masked sequence reads from both arms revealed a striking abundance of trnalys species, followed by trnamet and trnaser ; however, these abundances were largely attributed to an expansion driven by te-capture and subsequent expansion of the repetitive elements. this abundance within repetitive elements may include many non-functional copies, but the putative trna gene distributions of the non-repetitive sequences could have functional implications. it has been proposed that a species-specific preference for the second position in a protein sequence exists for the majority of proteins starting with a methionine  residue, which may have an effect on the translation, and thus regulation, of the protein. this preference was shown to be more profound in plants, represented by arabidopsis thaliana, which favoured alanine  residues, followed by serine  residues, at the second position  <cit> . such a preference should also be reflected in trna gene abundances, which is supported by the trnamet and trnaala predictions in this study. additionally, wobble base-pairing arising from the degeneracy of the genetic code has recently been proposed as an intentional mechanism to temporally control the expression of proteins  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that the abundance of certain trna genes may provide a more flexible use of anti-codons, and thereby wobble base-pairing as a means of gene regulation. furthermore, the differential enrichment of chromosomes 5a and 5d for putative trna species is intriguing; among the polar, non-polar and charged amino acid classes, each chromosome appears to favor a different subset of trna species. while our current understanding of the wheat genome suggests transcriptional autonomy without the dominance of each sub-genome  <cit> , the translational autonomy of individual chromosomes may present an interesting aspect of future research.

after eliminating the repetitive sequences, we found extensive homology to  <dig>  genes from the fully sequenced grass genomes on 5ds and  <dig>  on 5dl. we observed several differences in gene and synteny conservation between the two arms of the chromosome. in particular, the telomeric region of 5ds appears to have had a large accumulation of non-syntenic genes compared to the rest of the chromosome. a similar phenomenon was observed to differing degrees for chromosomes arms 1bs and 1as  <cit>  and proposed to be driven by te activity. furthermore, a higher proportion of conserved gene sequences on 5dl than 5ds had homology to  <dig> or more of the sequenced grass genomes , and evidence for expression . these observations might be explained by the observed introgression of non-syntenic gene sequences into the telomeric region of 5ds. if such sequences were introduced during te replication, they are likely to be incomplete, and so accumulate more sequence mutations than functional genes. however, the impact of differing recombination rates or te activity in other regions of the chromosome cannot be ruled out. also intriguing is the observation that a higher proportion of gene sequences on 5ds than 5dl were conserved with both b. distachyon & o. sativa but not s. bicolor, while the opposite trend was observed for genes conserved with b. distachyon & s. bicolor only . one possible explanation for this would be regional variations in the mutation rate of the chromosome 5d gene space at different stages of evolutionary history. the panicoideae sub-family  diverged from the pooideae  earlier than the ehrhartoideae   <cit> . if the mutation rate of the 5ds gene space was greater between these two divergences, while that of the 5dl gene space was greater at some stage after the rice and wheat lineages diverged, it might give rise to the observed pattern. a more comprehensive study of such semi-conserved gene sequences would be valuable, to reveal whether such differences are widespread in the wheat genome. the locations of conserved genes on the other grass genomes enabled syntenic regions to be identified  while mapping of known est & ssr markers and comparison with syntenic regions from brachypodium enabled the order of syntenic genes in the chromosome to be assessed . using chromosome-specific sequences is particularly helpful in this case; by whole-genome shotgun sequencing, only one b. distachyon syntenic region could be mapped for 5d  due to the scarcity of genetic markers on the d genome  <cit> , whereas, here, two different regions of chromosome  <dig> were also highlighted. the co-linearity of syntenic genes between 5ds and b. distachyon seems to have been well-maintained, with one possible inversion in the middle of the chromosome arm. in contrast, the peri-centromeric region of 5dl that is syntenic with bd <dig> appears to have undergone two large-scale rearrangements. this is in contrast with 5al, where the co-linearity with bd <dig> is maintained but the region syntenic to bd <dig> contains an inversion  <cit> . comparison with h. vulgare 5h  <cit>  further highlighted the conservation of large-scale co-linearity between triticeae, but with many differences at the level of individual genes.

the reads matching conserved genes and unigene/uniprot sequences were reassembled and mapped with t. aestivum transcriptome sequences, giving  <dig> high-confidence gene models on 5ds and  <dig>  on 5dl, along with a smaller number of low-confidence gene models with more limited transcript coverage . in the iwgsc dataset,  <dig> high-confidence gene models were anchored to 5ds and  <dig>  to 5dl, analogous to our conserved gene models. while the figures are in a similar range, the differences raise a question of interest to researchers planning to make use of these sequences: how reliable are the gene models? one way of answering this is to test their consistency between different datasets . while many gene models were highly consistent between studies, slight sequence differences were common, reflecting the biases of the sequencing technologies and assembly strategies used. in a genome where homoeologs may have up to 99% sequence identity  <cit>  this can lead to conflicting chromosome location assignments. comparing our 5d gene models with those from the iwgsc study, sequences of ≤98% nucleotide identity were just as likely to be found elsewhere in the genome as on 5d. furthermore, even at 100% sequence identity, some gene models were assigned to other chromosomes. this comparison gives confirmation of the location of many genes on 5d, while highlighting some that require verification. similarly, we were able to assign a number of gene models from the whole genome shotgun study  <cit>  that were not previously mapped to a sub-genome to chromosome 5d. these issues illustrate the value of combining different sequencing strategies to give a more comprehensive survey of the chromosome, and highlight the need for a reference sequence assembly of the entire wheat genome, which has so far only been achieved for 3b  <cit> .

some of the putative ‘non-conserved gene-like sequences’ are likely to be pseudogenes or gene fragments, but they also include many expressed genes, as shown by the transcriptome mapping. these are of particular interest as the previous genome-wide sequence surveys focused on conservation with other grasses to define their gene models, and so may have omitted some of the genes that have diverged in protein sequence from their counterparts in other grass genomes and so have novel, triticeae-specific functions. there is evidence for extensive intra-chromosomal gene duplications on 3b  <cit> , and the enrichment for specific go terms among these gene-related sequences on 5d  may suggest a similar recent expansion of specific gene families.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the survey sequences presented here include  <dig>  high-confidence and  <dig>  low-confidence gene models for t. aestivum chromosome 5d including sequences orthologous with other grass genomes and others derived from more divergent sequences. of the conserved orthologous genes,  <dig>  were placed in a virtual gene order. these data are complementary to other t. aestivum sequence datasets, verifying some gene models, allowing some, for which no chromosome location was known, to be assigned to 5d, and highlighting others for which the current map location is questionable. furthermore, evidence was found both for large-scale rearrangements of this chromosome compared to 5a and an accumulation of non-syntenic genes near the telomere of 5ds, highlighting that evolutionary processes have led to structural divergence between the wheat sub-genomes and even between different regions of the same chromosome. the detailed examination of 5d presented here suggests that there have been a large number of gene rearrangements and translocations since its divergence from b. distachyon, distributed throughout the chromosome but especially in the telomeric region of 5ds. these present opportunities for chromosome-specific marker development, and will be a valuable resource for the future mapping and reference-quality sequencing of this chromosome.
