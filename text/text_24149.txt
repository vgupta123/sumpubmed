BACKGROUND
studies of the global composition of snake venoms have advanced dramatically in recent years with the introduction of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches for analyzing venom gland gene expression and venom composition  <cit> . the introduction of these two major fields in toxinology has created new perspectives for identifying novel molecules for drug discovery  <cit>  and for improving antivenom development and the clinical treatment of snakebite  <cit> . a combination of these two approaches can be particularly useful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of venom composition  <cit> .

detailed transcriptomic studies of snake venom glands began with the report of junqueira-de-azevedo and ho  <cit>  who analyzed expressed sequence tags  from the venom gland of the brazilian pitviper bothrops insularis, a species endemic to the island of queimada grande off the coast of the state of são paulo in southeastern brazil. since then, venom gland transcriptomes have been reported for various other south american venomous snakes, including bothrops species  <cit> , crotalus durissus collilineatus   <cit> , lachesis muta   <cit> , micrurus corallinus   <cit>  and the colubrid philodryas olfersii  <cit> .

the genus bothrops is responsible for most cases of snakebite throughout latin america  <cit>  and in brazil accounts for 80-90% of bites by venomous snakes. envenoming by bothrops species results in extensive local effects, including pain, edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and necrosis  <cit> , as well as systemic actions that include coagulopathy, internal hemorrhage, circulatory shock and acute renal failure  <cit> . these actions are mediated by a variety of venom components, with the most extensively studied being  metalloproteinases  <cit>  and myotoxic phospholipases a <dig>   <cit> .

bothrops alternatus occurs in southeastern and southern brazil, uruguay, central and northern argentina and south-eastern and southern paraguay  <cit> . this species is an important cause of snakebite, although the prevalence of bites varies considerably throughout its geographic distribution depending on the regional human and snake population densities and the presence of more abundant species such as bothrops jararaca, the major cause of snakebite in southeastern brazil. thus, for example, notifications of bites by brazilian bothrops spp. received by the instituto butantan from 1902- <dig>  suggest that b. alternatus accounts for ~6% of bites by this genus  <cit> . in contrast, in a more recent series of  <dig>  cases attended at the hospital vital brazil, instituto butantan in são paulo, from 1981- <dig>  only two  of the  <dig>  cases in which the bothrops species was identified were caused by b. alternatus compared to  <dig>   by b. jararaca  <cit> . in regions where b. alternatus is more abundant or predominates , this species contributes to much a greater proportion of snakebites, e.g., 18% in argentina, but may be much higher locally   <cit> .

bothrops alternatus produces clinical manifestations characteristic of this genus  <cit> . in a series of  <dig> cases involving this species  <cit> , most of the patients  were 15- <dig> years old and were bitten in the lower limbs . all patients developed local pain, edema and most  had incoagulable blood,  <dig>  developed hemorrhage,  <dig>  had blisters and  <dig>  showed necrosis; there were no fatalities. in addition, renal failure has been observed after bites by this species in uruguay  <cit> . the administration of antivenom  is the standard treatment for envenoming by b. alternatus. these antivenoms may be bivalent  or poplyvalent   <cit> . in the case series studied by bauab et al.  <cit> , a median of  <dig> ml of antivenom  was administered.

although b. alternatus venom contains a variety of enzymatic and biological activities, relatively few of the venom proteins involved have been purified and characterized, with most investigations having dealt with metalloproteinases and disintegrins  <cit> , pla <dig>  <cit> , coagulant enzymes  <cit> , l-amino acid oxidase   <cit>  and phosphodiesterase  <cit> . despite these investigations, the venom of b. alternatus is still less understood than those of other bothrops species such as b. jararaca and b. jararacussu. in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the toxinology of this species, we have used a transcriptomic approach to examine venom gland gene expression in b. alternatus and compared the results with those for other members of this genus.

methods
venom glands and rna isolation
venom glands from three adult b. alternatus snakes were obtained three days after venom extraction. the choice of this interval was based essentially on other studies  <cit>  that used this period, although intervals of two  <cit>  and four  <cit>  days post-milking have also been used for bothrops species. the choice of a 2- <dig> day post-milking interval prior to gland removal is partly based on studies of venom mrna and protein synthesis in snake venom glands that show maximal production 3- <dig> days post-milking , and partly on histological and functional studies in b. jararacussu  <cit>  and b. jararaca  <cit> , respectively, showing that changes in gland epithelial morphology and venom production peak around four days post-milking.

each pair of venom glands was homogenized in liquid nitrogen and total rna was extracted with trizol reagent , according to the manufacturer's instructions. three cdna libraries  were independently constructed with cloneminer cdna library construction kits , according to the manufacturer's instructions. the cdna libraries were processed and analyzed using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline, with all annotations being done manually  for each library. the production of three independent libraries meant that it was possible to undertake detailed analyses of snps, microsatellites and inversions not generally done for bothrops species since in most studies the venom glands of different snakes are usually combined into a single pool for mrna extraction, with a subsequent loss of information.

this work was approved by the institutional committee for ethics in animal experimentation  and was done according to the ethical guidelines of the brazilian society of laboratory animal science .

sequencing
the cdna libraries were sequenced using bigdye terminator  <dig>  kits and an automated dna capillary sequencer . all of the cdna sequences were 5' sequenced using the primer m13f .

clusterization, assembly and identification of bothrops alternatus expressed-sequence tags
the phred program  <cit>  was used to obtain sequences and quality files from chromatograms obtained from expressed-sequence tag  sequencing. the est cleaning pipeline described by baudet and dias  <cit>  was then used to pre-process the ests and prepare the sequences for assembly. this pipeline removes sequences with plasmid similarity, polya/polyt regions, low base quality and slippage signals. sequences < <dig> bp long after cleaning were discarded. cap <dig> software  <cit>  was used to cluster and assemble the clean sequences into contigs and singlets . for assembly, an overlap of  <dig> bp and an identity of at least 95% were used as criteria to detect pairwise similarities.

annotation of bothrops alternatus ests
after clustering and assembly, a blast search was done to identify similarities between the ests and sequences deposited in public databases. all of the sequences were aligned against the genbank non-redundant  protein database using blastx and blastn  <cit>  with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  the b. alternatus ests were also screened against two locally generated sequence databases, serpp and serpn, that included all snake protein and nucleotide sequences from genbank, respectively. in addition, the ests were compared with the complete genome of the lizard anolis carolinensis . gene ontology annotation was done with blast2go  <cit>  using go-slim terms. the uncharacterized ests were examined for the presence of a signal peptide by using signalp  <dig>  software .

sequence alignments
sequence alignments for selected proteins were done with the program clustalw  <cit> .

single nucleotide polymorphisms
the software qualitysnp  <cit>  was used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms . non-synonymous and synonymous snps  were identified by detecting open-reading frames  of contigs with snps using the fasta algorithm run against the  <dig> version of uniprot  <cit> . the possibility of snps arising from artifacts during dna sequencing was minimized by the fact that the cdna libraries were prepared independently from three snakes and that we used consensus sequences from contigs with at least three reads from separate sequencing plates for which the cdna was prepared and the reactions run on different days. these procedures considerably reduced the possiblity of artifacts derived from dna sequencing and strengthened our conclusions regarding the presence of snps.

identification of transposable elements and long inverted repeats
alignment of the unisequences to repetitive elements in repbase release  <dig>   <cit>  was done with blastn that was automated using in-house perl scripts . the e-value cut-off was set at  <dig> × 10- <dig> and only alignments of at least  <dig> bp were considered for unisequences. in addition, the alignments with database sequences had to show >80% identity over at least 10% of their lengths. to identify possible functional integrations of transposable elements  into host genes, we searched for chimeric transcripts between tes and protein-coding genes. unisequences that aligned with a te in the database over 10% to 90% of their sequence were used to match the sequence back to the corresponding host gene by masking the element in the sequence and querying the ncbi nr nucleotide database. for tblastx remote searches, a minimum of 50% of the sequence was required to be involved in the best hit, with at least 70% identity.

additional repeated elements that were not present in repbase were observed in some unisequences. these novel elements were identified using the palindrome program in the emboss package  <cit> . unisequences that contained inverted repeats were identified by aligning each transcript against itself using blastn  and then inspected visually to check for alignments in opposite strands. the upper limit for mismatches between the two repeated segments was 10%.

comparison of the b. alternatus est library with other bothrops species
the pattern of gene expression in b. alternatus venom gland was compared with est data for other bothrops species  available in public databases, and with the major toxin classes detected by proteomic analyses of bothrops venoms. in this comparison and in the description of the different toxin groups discussed below, the relative percentages of the venom gland est categories were calculated as a percentage of the overall  number of all ests identified, whereas the relative percentages of the ests related to specific toxin groups was calculated based on the total number of toxin ests identified.

RESULTS
venom gland est database
cdna libraries were generated from three pairs of b. alternatus venom glands and analyzed using the pipeline shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  valid unisequences was obtained by single-pass sequencing and, after trimming, the lengths of the sequences ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp  . the ests were assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. thirty percent of the sequences  were hits, of which  <dig>   were related to toxins; the remaining 70%  were no-hits. figure  <dig> shows the proportion of hits and no-hits for selected databases. the proportion of hits was greater against the genbank and serpn nucleotide databases compared to the corresponding protein databases. there was a particularly low number of hits in serpp, which likely reflects the limited number of non-venom snake protein sequences available in public databases.

signalp analysis identified  <dig> ests with signal peptides,  <dig> of which were related to snake toxins ,  <dig> were for other proteins and  <dig> were for unknown proteins.

all of the ests were deposited in the dbest division of genbank .

gene ontology 
a global go analysis  <cit>  of unisequences in relation to molecular function revealed that the largest number of transcripts was related to protein binding, followed by peptidase and transferase activities, calcium-binding, enzyme regulation, nucleic acid binding, structural protein and transporter activities, lipid binding, and transcriptional regulation . analysis of the biological processes revealed two major groups arbitrarily defined as those with > <dig> ests and those with ≤ <dig> ests. the former contained genes related to stress, responses to external stimuli, development, symbiosis, cell differentiation, dna metabolism, cell death and signal transduction, whereas the latter consisted of genes related to catabolism, precursor biosynthesis, translation, protein modification, transcription, lipid metabolism, protein and ion transport, cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation and cell cycle . the biological processes identified here generally agreed with the broad categories  degradation, structural functions and cell regulation) reported for other bothrops species  <cit>  and l. muta  <cit> .

selected venom gland proteins
venom gland receptors
we detected one transcript coding for a protein similar to α1d-adrenoceptor from b. jararaca. since α- and β-adrenergic mechanisms have an important role in venom production in b. jararaca  <cit> , principally through receptors structurally related to α1d- and α1b-adrenoceptors  <cit> , a similar regulatory mechanism mediated by these receptors probably also occurs in b. alternatus. another receptor identified was vascular endothelin type a  receptor . this receptor mediates the vasoconstrictor activity of the endothelin family of peptides in b. jararaca aorta  <cit>  and could be important in the regulation of vascular tone in blood vessels irrigating the venom gland.

a contig was identified for a calglandulin-like ef-hand protein. venom gland calglandulin, initially identified in b. insularis based on an est analysis of this venom gland  <cit>  and subsequently cloned and expressed from this species  <cit>  , is a ca2+-binding protein structurally similar to calmodulin and troponin c. this protein, which is venom gland-specific   <cit> , may have a role in the transport and secretion of venom toxins, in addition to possibly acting as an intracellular ca2+-chelator to regulate toxin activity.

dusp6
dual specificity phosphatases  have important functions in embryogenesis, cell growth and immune responses by acting as negative feedback regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinases   <cit> . dusp <dig> has an important role in snake embryogenesis, with high gene expression in the anterior part of the presomitic mesoderm  <cit> . this protein has not previously been detected in venom gland transcriptomes or in analyses of venom composition. we detected a partial sequence for dusp <dig> protein that shared similarity with the corresponding protein from pantherophis guttatus  . the role of dusp <dig> in the venom gland is unclear but may be related to development of the gland secretory epithelium and venom production.

thioredoxin
thioredoxin  is a protein with a variety of activities, including roles in dna synthesis, protein disulfide bond reduction and the degradation of h2o <dig> that may be related to protection against oxidative stress and the induction of apoptosis  <cit> . thioredoxin participates in redox reactions through the reversible oxidation of its active center dithiol to a disulfide, thereby catalyzing dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions; the reduction of the active site disulfide of oxidized trx to regenerate the dithiol of reduced trx is catalyzed by thioredoxin reductase, a selenium-containing flavoprotein  <cit> . trx is also involved in the reversible s-nitrosylation of cysteine residues in target proteins, an important step in signaling by intracellular nitric oxide . we found a protein sequence in the b. alternatus transcriptome that was related to trx previously identified in venom gland cdna from o. hannah  . the function of trx in venom glands is unknown, but it may be involved in protecting epithelial secretory cells of the gland from oxidative stress and death , particularly since venom components such as lao can cause cell death through the formation of h2o <dig>  <cit> .

venom components identified by ests
major toxin classes
metalloproteinases/disintegrins
bothrops venoms are rich in a variety of snake venom metalloproteinases  that contribute to local and systemic bleeding after envenoming  <cit> . svmps are currently classified in three major classes   <cit> , with piii metalloproteinases being particularly abundant and extensively studied in bothrops venoms. metalloproteinases were the most abundant venom components in b. alternatus venom gland  and were almost exclusively class piii proteins. svmps accounted for  <dig> ests that were grouped into  <dig> contigs, the most abundant of which were related to jararhagin from b. jararaca, russell's viper  venom factor × heavy chain  and hemorrhagic factor  <dig> , also from b. jararaca  . hits were also obtained for bothrops metalloproteinases such as berythactivase from b. erythromelas, bothropasin from b. jararaca and metalloproteinases ii  and iii  from b. jararacussu. there was a low number of transcripts for class pii proteins, including one transcript coding for contortrostatin and one contig related to insularinase. no class pi svmps were detected. the overwhelming abundance of transcripts for class piii svmps  observed here agrees well with the results of a proteomic analysis of this venom in which only class piii svmps were detected  <cit> . our finding of transcripts related to jararhagin and berythactivase also agrees with these authors who detected proteins related to these two svmps in b. alternatus venom.

in agreement with the abundance of svmp transcripts, two piii metalloproteinases have been isolated and characterized from this venom. souza et al.  <cit>  reported the characterization of a  <dig> kda piii metalloproteinase  from brazilian b. alternatus venom that can undergo autolysis to release a  <dig> kda ecd-disintegrin-like cysteine-rich domain . alternagin inhibits the binding of k <dig> cells to collagen by selectively blocking α2β <dig> integrin, in a manner similar to jararhagin from b. jararaca venom; this inhibitory action is apparently mediated by alternagin-c. subsequently, gay et al.  <cit>  also isolated alternagin  from argentine b. alternatus. this protein causes edema, hemorrhage and necrosis when administered intramuscularly in mice, and systemic hemorrhage, primarily in the lungs, kidneys and liver, when administered intravenously. cominetti et al.  <cit>  described the characterization of a  <dig> kda dimeric piii metalloproteinase/rdg-disintegrin  from brazilian b. alternatus venom. this enzyme, which accounts for at least  <dig> % of venom protein, inhibits adp-induced platelet aggregation via a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity. bag also blocks the adhesion of k <dig> cells to fibronectin , a phenomenon mediated by binding to α5β <dig> integrin, but has no effect on the adhesion of these cells to collagen type i .

the processing of pii and piii svmps gives rise to rdg-disintegrins and ecd-disintegrin-like cysteine-rich  domains, respectively, that exert a variety of biological activities through interaction with cell surface integrins  <cit> . in the b. alternatus ests, there were four ests coding for disintegrins, and at least three disintegrins were identified in a proteomic analysis of this venom  <cit> . as indicated above, autolysis of alternagin gives rise to alternagin-c, an ecd-disintegrin-like cysteine-rich domain  <cit> . alternagin-c exerts a variety of activities, including the induction of neutrophil migration via integrin signaling  <cit> , stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration  <cit>  and modulation of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , but has a limited beneficial effect on muscle regeneration  <cit> . more recently, another disintegrin  identified in a cdna library from b. alternatus venom gland, has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and melanoma mestastasis by interacting with αvβ <dig> integrin  <cit>  and prevents platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, thereby prolonging bleeding time in mice  <cit> ; the latter action is mediated by interaction with platelet αiibβ <dig> integrin.

phospholipase a2
bothrops venoms are rich in acidic and basic pla <dig> with asp or lys at position  <dig> in their active site. many of these pla <dig> cause pain, edema, inflammation and myotoxicity  <cit> , as well as neuromuscular blockade in vitro  <cit> . the content of myotoxic pla <dig> varies considerably among bothrops species, e.g., b. asper, b. colombiensis, b. fonsecai, b. jararacussu, b. moojeni, b. neuwiedi and b. pradoi have an elevated content of these enzymes whereas others, such as b. alternatus, b. atrox, b. cotiara, b. erythromelas and b. jararaca, have few or no myotoxins  <cit> . in addition, some species, e.g., b. jararacussu  <cit>  contain a variety of pla <dig> in addition to myotoxins. pla <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of b. alternatus venom components  . this pla <dig> content was similar to that of b. insularis   <cit>  and b. jararaca   <cit> , but considerably less than for b. atrox  and b. jararacussu . the b. alternatus pla <dig> formed two major groups: those related to botin pla <dig> , one of two acidic asp <dig> pla <dig> isoforms  characterized from the venom of b. insularis  <cit> , with  <dig> ests, and those related to an acidic  hypotensive asp <dig> pla <dig>  from b. jararacussu venom  <cit> , with  <dig> ests.

bintx-i causes mouse hind-paw edema, as well as myonecrosis and partial neuromuscular blockade in chick biventer cervicis preparations  <cit> . hence, it is probable that the corresponding pla <dig> in b. alternatus venom exert similar effects. in contrast, the acidic hypotensive pla <dig> from b. jararacussu is not myotoxic, cytotoxic or lethal but causes edema and hypotension, and inhibits platelet aggregation  <cit> . nisenbom et al.  <cit>  reported the characterization of an acidic  pla <dig> from b. alternatus that accounted for most of the lethality of this venom in mice and produced cardiovascular alterations such as dyspnea, tachycardia, arrhythmia and circulatory shock, as well as tissue damage . this enzyme therefore shares properties with b. insularis and b. jararacussu pla <dig> 

basic lys <dig> pla2s characteristic of bothrops venoms were not detected in this venom gland library, in agreement with a proteomic analysis of this venom  <cit>  and with est analyses of b. insularis  <cit>  and the bushmaster l. muta  <cit> . however, two ests coding for the basic pla <dig> of crotoxin  and one transcript for the pla <dig> β-neurotoxin ammodytoxin  were detected. the general absence of basic lys <dig> pla <dig> in the b. alternatus transcriptome agrees with the very low content of myotoxic pla <dig> already reported for this venom  <cit> . indeed, to date, only one basic  myotoxic lys <dig> pla <dig> has been isolated and characterized from this venom  <cit> . this pla <dig>  which accounts for <1% of the venom content, causes mouse footpad edema, skeletal muscle myonecrosis, lysis of c2c <dig> skeletal muscle myoblasts and presynaptic neuromuscular blockade in chick biventer cervicis and mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. however, given the very low level of this pla <dig> in the venom, its overall contribution to the activities of the venom is likely to be minimal.

in addition to pla <dig>  inhibitors of this enzyme were also detected . venom gland pla <dig> inhibitors show considerable sequence identity with γ-pli  identified in snake sera, including that of b. alternatus  <cit> .

serine proteinases
coagulopathy is a major complication of systemic envenoming by bothrops species that, in conjunction with the action of venom metalloproteinases, can contribute to systemic hemorrhage  <cit> . coagulation disturbances caused by bothrops venoms are mediated by a variety of enzymes that act at various points of the coagulation cascade, including fibrinogen degradation and fibrin consumption. the clinical outcome of this combined action is incoagulable blood. some of the serine proteinases may also have kinin-releasing activity that can contribute to local pain, vasodilation and systemic hypotension  <cit> . in the b. alternatus transcriptome, serine proteinases were the fourth most abundant group of toxins  , with ~42%  being related to bthatl, a serine proteinase identified in this venom by vitorino-cardoso et al.  <cit>  based on gene cloning and amino acid sequence analysis. this protein, which shares sequence identity  with a variety of snake venom thrombin-like enzymes , is probably the same as the tle balterobin previously purified and characterized by smolka et al.  <cit> . other proteins in this group were related to serine proteinase isoform  <dig> , venom serum proteinase-like protein  <dig> precursor  and venom serine proteinase hs <dig> precursor  and tle . in addition, there was one transcript with a hit in a utr for a protein similar to kn-bj <dig>  a kinin-releasing, fibrinogen clotting enzyme from b. jararaca venom  <cit> . the range of serine proteinases identified here in ests agrees with the presence of coagulant  and kinin-releasing enzymes identified in the proteome of this venom  <cit> . the abundance of serine proteinases in the b. alternatus transcriptome was similar to the 2% reported for b. jararacussu  <cit>  but considerably less than in other species of this genus, e.g., ranging from  <dig> % in b. atrox  <cit>  to  <dig> % in b. jararaca  <cit> . differences in the relative proportion of serine proteinases present in the venoms could contribute to variations in the severity of coagulopathy among bothrops species.

c-type lectins
proteins with c-type lectin-like domains are widespread in the animal kingdom, including venoms. venom c-type lectins form two major groups: true c-type lectins with carbohydrate binding domains and c-type lectin-like proteins with non-carbohydrate binding domains, the latter consisting mainly of factor ix/x binding proteins and proteins that interact with platelet receptors. c-type lectins are involved in venom-induced coagulation disturbances and have been identified in various bothrops ests  <cit> . these proteins formed the fifth most abundant class of toxin transcripts in b. alternatus   and were related to the α subunit of platelet glycoprotein ib-binding protein , the acf 1/ <dig> β chain , coagulation factor ix-binding protein  and bothrojaracin . there was also a transcript for convulxin , a c-type lectin initially identified in the venom of c. d. terrificus . the abundance of c-type lectins was considerably less than in b. atrox , b. insularis , b. jararaca  and b. jararacussu ; if these relative proportions are reflected in the venoms, then c-type lectins may contribute less to coagulopathy in bites by b. alternatus than by other bothrops spp.

few proteins of this class have been characterized from b. alternatus venom. bothrojaracin, a  <dig> kda heterodimer  initially purified from b. jararaca venom, is homologous to several c-type lectin family proteins and inhibits thrombin activity, e.g., platelet aggregation and fibrinogen clotting, by interacting with exosites i and ii of this enzyme to form a non-covalent complex  <cit> . castro et al.  <cit>  characterized bothroalternin, a bothrojaracin-like protein, from b. alternatus venom; this protein  <dig> kda homodimer cross-reacts with antibodies to bothrojaracin, shares sequence identity  with the α and β chains of factor ix/x binding protein and botrocetin from b. jararaca venom, and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. bothroalternin has also been detected in the proteome of b. alternatus  <cit> .

sugar-binding lectins, which are related to c-type lectins, have been detected in some bothrops ests  <cit> , but were not detected here or in b. jararaca  <cit> .

bradykinin-potentiating peptide and c-type natriuretic peptide precursors
bothrops venoms have long been known to contain bradykinin-potentiating peptides  that enhance venom-induced hypotension by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme, a pivotal enzyme in the formation of angiotensin ii  and degradation of bradykinin   <cit> . numerous such peptides have since been identified in bothrops venoms , and cloning and sequence analysis studies in the late 1990s identified genes encoding bpps in b. jararaca venom gland  <cit> . these same studies also reported the presence of genes encoding for c-type natriuretic peptides  that could contribute to venom-induced hypotension. transcriptomic studies of bothrops venom glands have confirmed these findings and shown that genes encoding these two peptides account for 6-20% of venom toxin ests  <cit> . a similar percentage  was observed here for b. alternatus , for which  <dig> ests coded for bpp/cnp precursors  while another  <dig> ests showed similarities only in the 3'utr. in contrast to the abundance of bpp/cnp transcripts detected in bothrops spp. by est analysis, proteomic analyses have shown that these peptides account for <1% of the venom protein/peptide content  <cit> , although in b. insularis the venom bpp content is 10%  <cit> . a similar situation applies to cnps for which some peptidomic analyses have detected no such peptides in venom, despite the identification of transcripts in est analyses, e.g., b. insularis  <cit>  and l. muta  .

minor toxin classes
cysteine-rich secretory proteins
snake venom cysteine-rich secretory proteins  are 23- <dig> kda proteins with a high content of cysteine residues  that form eight disulfide bridges. crisps are widespread in snake venoms and have been detected in transcriptomic  <cit>  and proteomic  <cit>  studies of bothrops venoms, where they account for  <dig> -2% and 0- <dig> % of venom genes and toxins, respectively. in agreement with these studies, we detected five ests with protein  for crisps in b. alternatus venom gland. although the role of venom crisps remains poorly understood, several members of this family block a variety of ion channels, including l-type ca2+ channels, cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels, voltage-activated k+ channels , high-conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels  and the ryanodine-sensitive intracellular ca2+ channel. peichoto et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that a crisp from the venom of the south american colubrid philodryas patagoniensis causes myonecrosis. since myonecrosis is an important local response to envenoming by bothrops spp., including b. alternatus, it is possible that crisps could contribute to this activity.

dipeptidylpeptidase iv
dipeptidylpeptidase iv   has a wide distribution in snake venoms  <cit> . dpp iv genes have been identified in the venom glands of b. jararaca  <cit> , gloydius blomhoffii brevicaudus  <cit> , l. muta  <cit>  and various australian elapids  <cit> . gasparello-clemente and silveira  <cit>  reported dpp iv in bothrops venoms, with the highest activity in b. alternatus. in agreement with this, we detected a transcript coding for ddp iv protein in b. alternatus. venom dpp iv, which has enzymatic properties similar to those of other eukaryotic dpp iv  <cit> , may contribute to venom-induced cardiovascular alterations, possibly by degrading endogenous peptides through association with exosome-like vesicles in fresh venom  <cit> , and possibly by interfering with glucose homeostasis and the immune and neuroendocrine systems  <cit> . dpp iv may also be important in processing polypeptide precursors of venom peptides, as suggested for wasp and bee venoms  <cit> .

growth factors
snake venom growth factors comprise primarily vascular endothelial growth factor  and nerve growth factor , both of which have been detected in bothrops ests  <cit> . we detected five ests for vegf similar to b. insularis vegf  <cit> , one est similar to l. muta vegf  <cit>  and one est similar to c. d. terrificus ngf. however, the proportion of growth factor transcripts in b. alternatus was lower than in other bothrops ests. junqueira-de-azevedo et al.  <cit>  showed that svvegf from b. insularis venom was able to increase vascular permeability and suggested that this protein could be involved in local and systemic vascular responses to envenoming.

hyaluronidase
hyaluronidase, which has an important role in facilitating venom diffusion from the site of inoculation through its degradation of hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix, is widespread in bothrops venoms  <cit> . however, hyaluronidase has not generally been detected in transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of this genus, perhaps because of its low level of expression in venom glands. in agreement with this, we found only one est similar to truncated hyaluronidase from bitis arietans in the b. alternatus cdna library.

l-amino acid oxidase
l-amino acid oxidase , which is widespread in bothrops venoms  <cit> , exerts a variety of biological activities, including interference with platelet aggregation, cytotoxicity and microbicidal activity  <cit> . these deleterious effects are mediated largely via the production of h2o <dig> during the oxidation of α-keto amino acids. lao accounts for  <dig> - <dig> % of toxin transcripts in bothrops venom gland transcriptomes  <cit>  and has been purified and characterized from these venoms  <cit> . in the case of b. alternatus, we detected seven ests for this toxin in the nucleotide region: four of these were related to lao from b. jararaca and three were ests in the 3'utr related to ophiophagus hannah lao. in contrast to this low transcript abundance, lao accounted for  <dig> % of the venom proteins identified in a proteomic analysis of b. alternatus venom  <cit> . lao purified from b. alternatus venom is an acidic , homodimeric  glycoprotein that induces platelet aggregation, causes edema, is bactericidal and slightly hemorrhagic  <cit> ; this enzyme may contribute to the cytotoxicity of b. alternatus venom in cultured madin-darby canine kidney  cells  <cit> .

three-finger toxins 
three-finger toxins  consist predominantly of elapid neurotoxins, including α-neurotoxins, cardiotoxins and fasciculins, and a variety of less well-characterized venom proteins  <cit> . originally thought to be restricted to elapids, 3-ftx have since been identified in crotalid  <cit>  and colubrid  <cit>  venom glands. 3-ftx exert a variety of biological activities that include blockade of acetylcholine  receptors, β-adrenergic receptors, l-type calcium channels and integrins, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, and cardiotoxicity mediated by interation with phospholipids.

we identified  <dig> ests for 3-ftx in the b. alternatus venom gland library  that shared 90% similarity with the intron ii region of the gene for 3ftx- <dig> from sistrurus catenatus edwardsi  <cit> , but no hits with colubrid, elapid or l. muta  <cit>  3-ftx. pahari et al.  <cit>  also noted that the 3-ftx nucleotide and protein sequences of s. c. edwardsi bore no relationship to those of l. muta, a finding confirmed by phylogenetic analysis that placed the l. muta toxins distant from those of s. c. edwardsi. complete sequencing of the b. alternatus genes would be helpful in determining the precise relationship between these 3-ftx and those of s. c. edwardsi.

this is the first identification of 3-ftx genes in bothrops and, together with other studies, suggests that this class of toxins may occur in a variety of new world pitvipers, i.e., bothrops , sistrurus  <cit>  and lachesis  <cit>   and atropoides mexicanus     <cit> . however, transcriptomic analyses have not detected these toxins in other new world pitvipers, e.g., agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma  <cit>  and c. d. collilineatus  <cit> , or in old world pitvipers  acutus  <cit> ) and vipers . in addition to this inter-generic variation, there is also intra-generic variation in the occurrence of 3-ftx. thus, whereas 3-ftx have been detected in a transcriptomic analysis of s. c. edwardsi  <cit> , these toxins have not been detected in a proteomic analysis of venoms from several members of this genus  <cit> . likewise, a. mexicanus  venom, but not that of a. picadoi, contains 3-ftx  <cit> . such variation may reflect the low abundance of transcripts and proteins  and/or the non-uniform recruitment of these toxins into the venom proteome  <cit> . this could explain why transcriptomic  <cit>  and proteomic  <cit>  analyses have generally not detected these genes and proteins in bothrops species.

the physiological relevance of 3-ftx to envenoming by bothrops species is unclear, particularly in view of the low transcript abundance indicated by our results. however, bothrops venoms cause neuromuscular blockade in avian and mammalian nerve-muscle preparations in vitro  <cit> . although most of this activity has been attributed to the action of basic myotoxic pla <dig>  <cit> , 3-ftx could also contribute to this response through their ability to interfere with neuromuscular transmission.

ohanin
envenoming by bothrops species results in local pain at the bite site  <cit> . venom components implicated in this phenomenon include pla <dig>  metalloproteinases and serine proteinases that act via the release of endogenous mediators such as arachidonic acid metabolites , bradykinin, proinflammatory cytokines and neuronal nitric oxide  <cit> . in contrast, little is known of the involvement of other bothrops venom proteins in this pain. the identification here of  <dig> ests with hits in the 3'utr of the precursor for ohanin, an ~ <dig> kda hypolocomotion and hyperalgesic protein initially identified in the venom of the king cobra, o. hannah, and part of the vespryn family of proteins  <cit> , indicates that other venom proteins, in addition to those indicated above, may be involved in bothrops venom-induced pain. since its initial identification, ohanin  has been found in australian elapids  <cit>  and pitvipers such as a. acutus  <cit> , c. d. collilineatus  <cit>  and l. muta  <cit> . our finding is the first report for ohanin in bothrops venom glands. together, these reports indicate that ohanins  are likely to be widespread in snake venoms where they may contribute to venom-induced hyperalgesia.

taicatoxin-like protein
we detected two ests coding for a protein related to the serine proteinase inhibitor component of taicatoxin , a multimeric protein composed of an α-neurotoxin-like peptide , a neurotoxin pla <dig>  and a serine proteinase inhibitor   initially isolated from the venom of the australian taipan   <cit> . tcx blocks high threshold, voltage-dependent calcium channel currents in cardiac membranes and cultured ventricular myocytes, although there may also be a role for the pla <dig> activity in the action of this toxin  <cit> . the role of putative tcx-like proteins in b. alternatus is unclear but could contribute to the cardiovascular actions of this venom.

other toxins
in addition to the foregoing toxins, we identified a low number of hits for several other toxins with blast results only in the nucleotide database. these hits included toxins related to cardiotoxins , a muscarinic-like toxin  related to that of bungarus multicinctus, precursors similar to post-synaptic α-neurotoxin ntx- <dig> from naja sputatrix  and neurotoxin  <dig>  and a molecule related to cobra-venom factor .

putative toxins
snake venoms contain a variety of nucleotidases  and nucleases  that have a potentially important role in envenoming, particularly in affecting platelet aggregation and cardiovascular responses   <cit> . in agreement with this, we obtained transcripts coding for a variety of genes related to some of these proteins, including an acidic dnase similar to a mouse dnase iiα  precursor , ecto-5'-nucleotidases , ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase  <dig>  and an adenosine deaminase related to xenopus laevis enzyme . although several of these genes have been detected in other transcriptomic analyses  <cit> , it is currently unclear whether the corresponding proteins are secreted into the venom or simply part of normal intracellular metabolism in the venom gland. we have purified phosphodiesterase  <cit> , 5'-nucleotidase and an acidic dnase   from b. alternatus venom, but since the structure of these proteins is unknown it is unclear to what extent they share similarity with the proteins coded by the genes identified in the venom gland ests. ogawa et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that g. blomhoffi ecto-5'-nucleotidase is structurally similar to this enzyme from various other vertebrates.

other genes identified that could potentially be involved in envenoming included a cytokine-like protein   and tumor necrosis factor , both of which could contribute to the venom-induced local inflammatory response.

selected features of b. alternatus venom gland ests
single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple repeats 
polymorphisms in the nucleic acid sequences of snake venom proteins, particularly pla <dig>  have been identified in several species  <cit> . these genetic modifications arise from rapid gene duplication followed by single nucleotide polymorphisms , with an increase in non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that alter the dna sequence encoding the protein. ohno et al.  <cit>  suggested that such alterations result in the rapid appearance of novel toxins with different biological activities. our analysis revealed  <dig> putative snps in the b. alternatus transcriptome, of which  <dig>  were located in orfs, as determined based on alignment against the uniprot database. in addition, we identified  <dig> insertion-deletion polymorphisms  . although not extensively studied, detailed analysis of venom protein snps could be useful for population genetic studies and for assessing the importance of rapid sequence changes in generating the observed diversity of genes involved in venom production  <cit> .

the polymorphisms were detected using the program truesnp, with the highest number being detected in genes related to jararhagin from b. jararaca.

the screening of unisequences with the tandem repeats finder tool resulted in the identification of  <dig> sequences with possible microsatellite regions; when annotated sequences with transposable elements  were excluded,  <dig> sequences with microsatellite regions were identified . these sequences could be potentially useful for the development of molecular markers for characterization of the genetic variability and population structure of b. alternatus throughout its geographic distribution.

transposable elements
eukaryotic genomes contain a large number of repeated sequences, a high proportion of which may consist of transposable elements . in snakes, tes have been previously identified in pla <dig> genes from the venom gland of vipera ammodytes  <cit> . these tes are ruminant retroposons corresponding to 5'-truncated bov-b long interspersed repeated dna  and were identified in ammodytin l  and ammodytoxin c  genes. alignments meeting our criteria  allowed the identification of repeated elements in  <dig> unisequences, which corresponded to 9% of the b. alternatus ests ; transposons have also been identified in b. insularis  <cit>  and l. muta  <cit> . several te families were identified among the b. alternatus transcripts, the most abundant being bovb, which was identified in  <dig> unisequences . the expression of these te families indicated that the genome harbored a large number of potentially active elements that gave rise to a variety of ests.

the most frequently encountered te was bovb, also identified in vipera.

further examination of the  <dig> unisequences harboring tes revealed that  <dig> of them were fused to a sequence not included in the repeats database. to determine the identity of these sequences, we masked the tes and blasted the masked unisequences against the genebank nr database. this approach revealed that in  <dig> unisequences, the te was fused to a protein-coding gene . most transposition events involving protein-coding regions are deleterious to host genomes because they disrupt mrna translation, localization and stability. however, since tes associated with pla <dig> genes have been found to be transcribed  <cit> , we hypothesize that the tes in b. alternatus may act as a source of genetic novelty by playing an important role in the origin and diversity of toxin genes.

inverted repeats
the alignment of b. alternatus unisequences to corresponding reference genes indicated that some of the genes contained long inverted repeats  in which a segment of the sequence was inverted from its original orientation in the reference gene . an interesting example of such inversions involved genes for bpps/cnps, for which  <dig> unisequences with inverted repeats were observed . figure  <dig> shows the case in which an ir occurred in a portion of mrna coding for part of a cnp. as mentioned above in the discussion of cnp genes, although est studies have indicated the presence of genes for these peptides in bothrops and lachesis species, proteomic studies have not always been successful in isolating and identifying these peptides  <cit> . the reason for this discrepancy between est and proteomic findings has not been adequately addressed but one explanation could be related to the occurrence of ir in these genes that may interfere with adequate gene transcription and/or translation in vivo, thereby preventing toxin production.

the origin of such ir transcripts is unclear. theoretically, they could be artifacts generated by end-to-end joining of non-contiguous cdna sequences and template switching by reverse transcriptase during cdna synthesis; template switching can artificially delete portions of cdnas and be wrongly interpreted as alternative transcripts. during first strand cdna synthesis, poly+ rnas are primed by an oligo and when the reverse transcriptase reaches the 5'-end of the junction site in the mrna, the nascent cdna switches the template to the ir in the antisense mrna that will now be used as a new template. however, since the homologous recombination between two rna templates promoted by reverse transcriptase requires rnase h activity, and since the powerscript™ reverse transcriptase used here for cdna synthesis lacked rnase h activity, it seems unlikely that homology-dependent template switching could have generated these hybrid cdnas artificially.

further reasons that the ir observed here are unlikely to be artifacts include the following: 1) end-to-end joining during library construction would randomly ligate molecules and one would expect not only intra-molecular hybrids but also ligation of independently transcribed mrnas, 2) in the case of an artifact, the transcript of highest abundance would be expected to be frequently ligated to other transcripts to form inter-molecular hybrids, but this was not observed in our library, and 3) the finding that the same ests containing inversions were present in multiple sequence reads from the same library and in independent libraries. together, these observations suggest that this phenomenon was not an artifact.

comparison of the b. alternatus transcriptome with other bothrops species
following the initial report of gene expression analysis in the venom gland of b. insularis , similar studies were reported for other bothrops species, including b. atrox  <cit> , b. jararaca  <cit>  and b. jararacussu  <cit> . the availability of data for several bothrops species provides an opportunity to compare related species and draw some general conclusions regarding venom composition in this genus. few such transcriptomic comparisons are available for other genera  <cit> .

to date, our study represents the largest est database for bothrops; the  <dig>  ests reported here considerably exceed those reported for b. atrox   <cit> , b. insularis   <cit> , b. jararaca   <cit>  and b. jararacussu   <cit> . we chose to generate a larger database than those previously reported for bothrops species in an attempt to identify novel genes in addition to the main toxin groups already known for this genus. indeed, this larger database allowed the detection of genes for toxins such as ohanin and 3-ftx, previously identified in other snake genera but not in bothrops, in addition to non-venom proteins such as dusp <dig> and thioredoxin.

the generation of a large database for b. alternatus did not significantly alter the profile of the most common toxin groups  when compared with other bothrops species. this finding suggests that a large database is not essential for identification of the major toxin groups but can be useful for increasing the chances of detecting toxins with very low transcript abundance. this conclusion agrees with data for b. insularis in which increasing the est database from  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig>  <cit>  ests did not markedly alter the relative proportions of metalloproteinases , bpps/cnps , c-type lectins , serine proteinases , pla <dig> , svvegf , lao , crisps  and ngf . in the present study, 78% of the hits corresponded to toxin transcripts, which compares favorably with values for other bothrops species   <cit>  and indicates that the relative proportion of toxin transcripts is not directly related to the size of the cdna library.

conversely, the generation of a large database resulted in a considerably greater number of no-hits: 70% in this study compared to 13% - 25% for other bothrops studies  <cit>  and 7% - 54% for other snake genera  <cit> . these no-hits reflect the limited amount of information available for bothrops species and other snakes in venom gland est databases, and represent a potentially rich source for the identification of novel toxins.

for five bothrops species  there are transcriptomic and proteomic analyses that allow comparison of the toxin frequencies in the different classes. for metalloproteinases and pla <dig>  there is reasonably good agreement between the proportion of transcripts and the corresponding levels of these proteins detected in the venoms, whereas for other classes, e.g., bpps, c-type lectins and serine proteinases, there are often marked discrepancies between the transcriptomic and proteomic data . in the case of b. alternatus, there was good agreement between the proportion of ests  and venom content  <cit>  of pla <dig>  and c-type lectins , but considerable divergence between these two data sets in the case of metalloproteinases , serine proteinases  and lao  . divergent transcriptomic and proteomic results have also been observed for certain toxin groups in other snake genera, e.g., echis species  <cit>  and l. muta  <cit> . the causes and implications of such discrepancies have been discussed elsewhere  <cit>  and indicate the need for caution in interpreting transcriptomic data as being representative of the final venom composition.

finally, it should be noted that the principal toxin classes identified by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are those that have been shown to contribute to the major local and systemic effects produced by these venoms, i.e., potent hemorrhagic activity , extensive myonecrosis , inflammatory responses , coagulopathy  and cardiovascular actions  seen experimentally and clinically  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
an est database containing  <dig>  ests was produced for the venom gland of b. alternatus, the largest to date for the genus bothrops. the venom gland expressed the major toxin groups  identified in transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of other bothrops species. in addition, genes for toxins  and non-venom components  not previously detected in bothrops venoms were also observed in this gland. the results described here expand our understanding of the composition of b. alternatus venom and help to explain the major symptoms associated with envenoming by this species.
