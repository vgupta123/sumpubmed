BACKGROUND
neonatal diarrhoea, often caused by etec f <dig> bacteria, is a common problem in pig production. these bacteria use their fimbriae to adhere to specific receptors on the brush borders of enterocytes of their host. this adhesion is a prerequisite for infection and promotes bacterial colonization of the small intestine. the colonizing bacteria produce enterotoxins that stimulate the secretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen of the small intestine and lead to diarrhoea and often death in neonatal pigs  <cit> . etec f <dig> resistance, acquired by receptor phenotype differences of the host, seems to be inherited as an autosomal recessive mendelian trait  <cit> , whereby the gene encoding the etec f4ab/ac receptors have been linked to several loci on sscr <dig>  <cit> . based on the tight linkage of the etec f4ab/ac receptor loci to microsatellite markers swr <dig>  and swc <dig>  by peelman  <cit> , a bac contig covering this region and containing tf was built by chromosome walking. the contig was annotated by comparing bac sequences with sequences from nucleotide databases and by comparative mapping with the human genome sequence in order to provide a basis for the identification of the etec f4ab/ac gene by the candidate gene approach.

RESULTS
construction of the bac contig
the construction of the bac contig was started at  <dig> microsatellite marker loci, swr <dig> and swc <dig>  estimated to be  <dig> cm apart from each other and closely linked to the etec f4ab/ac receptor loci, according to the porcine genetic map of peelman  <cit> . from those  <dig> loci,  <dig> subcontigs were built by chromosome walking in both directions until the gap between the  <dig> was filled. the resulting bac contig, comprising  <dig> bac clones, is shown in figure 1c all  <dig> bac ends were sequenced and submitted to the genbank database as gsss . on  <dig> occasions,  <dig> bac clones turned out to possess the same end . from  <dig> of the  <dig> unique sequences, primers were designed to construct the contig and to screen for new overlapping clones. by dividing the total number of overlaps between the bac ends and the bac clones by the total number of bac ends an estimated contig depth of  <dig>  was calculated. since the average length of the bac inserts is  <dig>  bp, we have covered a region of approximately  ×  <dig>  =  <dig>  mb.

annotation of the bac end sequences
a total of  <dig>  bp of the bac contig  were sequenced and annotated by nix  <cit> . the sequences had an overall gc content of  <dig> %, which is less than the  <dig> % for sscr7q found in an analogous study of barbosa and co-workers  <cit> .

the bess contained  <dig> gene fragments  and  <dig> ests  located on the human genome   <cit> . in  <dig> of the  <dig> bess, homologous sequences could be found within  <dig> consecutive finished htgs used to assemble the hsap3q21-q <dig> region of the human genome sequence   <cit> . these homologies were studied in detail by blast  <dig> sequence comparisons of the bess with their orthologs . repeat sequences were excluded  and only single hits were taken into account. orthologous sequences longer than  <dig> bp had on average a length of  <dig> bp, a sequence identity of 80% and an e-value of 1e- <dig>  smaller fragments were only considered as orthologs if at least  <dig> of them were located close to each other at their expected orthologous position. an extended conservation of synteny between sscr <dig> and hsap <dig> was already shown by the comparative map of van poucke and co-workers  <cit> , based on chromosome painting results of goureau and co-workers  <cit> . but taking into account the orientation of the finished htgs and the position of the orthologous sequences within these htgs, a perfect comparative map could be established showing even 100% conserved linkage in this region.

based on this comparative map the bac contig covers approximately  <dig>  mb of the human genome   <cit> , which is close to the bac contig length calculated above. the bac sequences also contained  <dig> lines,  <dig> sines,  <dig> ltr elements and  <dig> dna element , resulting in an average density of  <dig>  lines/kb,  <dig>  sines/kb,  <dig>  ltr elements/kb and  <dig>  dna elements/kb. barbosa and co-workers  <cit>  found an average density of  <dig>  lines/kb,  <dig>  sines/kb and  <dig>  ltr+dna elements/kb on sscr7q.

comparative mapping with the human syntenic region
based on this detailed comparative map between hsap3q21-q <dig> and the bac contig, the latter could be annotated by comparative mapping. h <dig>  topbp <dig>  tf, srprb, rab6b, slco2a <dig> and ryk could be found in the contig by pcr . also pica, a gene not yet described in human but located on the pig est map of the ncbi human genome map viewer  <cit>  between topbp <dig> and tf, was found in the contig by pcr at the orthologous region . it showed sequence homology with the finished htg sequence ac <dig>  mgc <dig> and bfsp <dig> could be found in the contig by bac colony hybridisation . for mgc <dig>  tf and slco2a <dig> two regions of the gene were annotated in the contig. their locations showed that those genes were organised in the same orientation as in human. all the comparative mapping results confirmed the conserved linkage  based on the sequence homologies of the bess .

fifteen bac ends are also located on the sanger porcine framework map  <cit> . on average, they show  <dig> % sequence identity, and are located in the same order . this was expected because  the framework map was constructed by fingerprinting and bes alignment on the human sequence, and  this region shows 100% conserved linkage with the human genome. so, for this region, the sanger map assembly, based on the assumption of conservation between both species, is correct. but because of inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements between the human and the porcine chromosomes  <cit> , the sanger framework map contains some errors. this underlines the importance of the chromosome walking approach for the development of an exact map.

based on the characteristics of the genes annotated in this contig, slco2a <dig> could be a candidate gene encoding the etec f4ab/ac receptor. it is a single copy gene encoding the prostaglandin transporter, a 12-transmembrane organic anion cell surface transporter that is expressed in the small intestine. the presence of different mrna transcripts suggests that several functionally distinct mrnas may arise by alternative splicing and/or alternative promotors  <cit> . it is also assumed that slco2a <dig> contains several different substrate binding sites, to which binding does not always result in substrate translocation across the membrane  <cit> .

rh mapping
during chromosome walking,  <dig> loci were mapped with the imprh panel  in order to detect possible chromosome jumping, to estimate the remaining gap between the  <dig> subcontigs, and to anchor the contig to the integrated comparative map  <cit> . using the imprh server, 2-point distances were calculated between bac ends 409c1-3', 5'-613g <dig>  5'-991f <dig> and an internal sequence of bac 8a <dig>  and microsatellite markers swr <dig> and swc <dig>  that were previously mapped on the imprh map   <cit> . based on these distances, the contig covers a region of approximately  <dig> cr. thus,  <dig> cr equals approximately  <dig>  kb in our contig. the distance between swr <dig> and swc <dig> was measured as  <dig> cr. because the same distance was measured as  <dig> cm on a linkage map of peelman  <cit> , the cr/cm ratio in our contig is  <dig>  hawken and co-workers  <cit>  measured values for sscr <dig> of  <dig>  kb/cr and  <dig>  cr/cm with the linkage map of rohrer and co-workers  <cit> .

methods
primer design and amplicon verification
all primers, designed with primer <dig>  <cit> , were confirmed to not generate an amplicon of the same length with bacterial dna as a template. primers used for rh mapping were also checked not to generate an amplicon of the same length with hamster dna as a template. the construction of the bac contig was started with primers amplifying porcine microsatellite markers swr <dig>  and swc <dig> . during the construction of the bac contig, new primers were designed based on the bess . information on those primers can be found in the corresponding genbank files. for annotation by comparative mapping with the human genome, primers were designed based on orthologous human and/or porcine sequences. information on new primers is presented in table  <dig>  these pcr products were cloned in pcrii , sequenced for verification with the thermo sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit  and submitted to genbank . because of sequence homology, primers for pica were confirmed to not amplify tf. primers for ryk were described earlier  <cit> .

bac screening and contig building by chromosome walking
the inra porcine bac library was screened by pcr  <cit> . approximately  <dig> μg bac dna was purified from a  <dig> ml culture of the isolated bac clones by using the qiagen plasmid midi kit . the primers used to isolate the bac clones were used to amplify the same amplicon on  <dig> ng bac dna for verification. both ends of the isolated bac clones were sequenced with  <dig> μg bac dna as template by using the thermo sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit . primers based on those bess were used to construct the contig by defining overlaps with all other bac clones. primers at both ends of the growing subcontigs were used to screen the bac library for new overlapping clones until the gap between swr <dig> and swc <dig> was filled.

annotation
annotation of the contig was performed by analyzing all bac sequences on the nix server , and by comparative mapping using pcr and bac colony hybridization. these and similar sequence comparisons such as blast  <dig>  can also be performed via the ncbi blast server  <cit> . gene symbols, names and positions were based on the ncbi gene entrez  <cit>  and ncbi map viewer  <cit>  with the latter also used for the identification of the human htgs.

bac colony hybridization
for annotation purposes by comparative mapping with the human genome,  <dig> image clones , located in the human syntenic region, were ordered . inserts of these clones were used as radiolabeled probes for bac colony hybridization.

rh mapping
during chromosome walking,  <dig> loci were mapped on the imprh panel  <cit>  in order to detect possible chromosome jumping, to estimate the remaining gap between the  <dig> subcontigs, and to anchor the contig to the integrated comparative map  <cit> . swr <dig> and swc <dig>  <cit>  and tf  <cit>  were already located on the imprh map.

CONCLUSIONS
a porcine bac contig containing  <dig> bac clones and covering approximately  <dig>  mb of sscr13q31-q <dig> was constructed. the annotated contig, containing  <dig> genes and  <dig> ests, showed a complete conservation of linkage with hsap3q21-q <dig>  based on  <dig> anchor points, providing further evidence for conservation of linkage on a fine scale. this underlines the importance of the comparative mapping strategy between human and pig, not only in the search for genes in pig but also as a basis for the assembly of the porcine genome  <cit> . the contig also contains  <dig> anchor points with the sanger porcine framework map  <cit> ,  <dig> anchor points  with the integrated map of sscr <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  with the porcine map viewer  <cit> .
