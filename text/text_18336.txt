BACKGROUND
the microbial community of soil is extremely diverse and integral part of ecosystems that play a major role in the climate change trough contribution in soil organic matter decomposition  <cit> . prime reservoir of global terrestrial carbon resides in soil  <cit> , and fractional scale changes in cycling of total soil carbon could have considerable impacts on the density of atmospheric carbon dioxide. therefore, a change in soil carbon is a critical regulator of future climate in response to environmental changes  <cit> . climate change is a complex phenomenon regulated by numerous factors, including complex interactions and feedbacks between climate, plants, animals and soil microbes  <cit> .

overall, global warming effects are more prime on microbial community and consequent decomposition processes in alpine, arctic and highland regions  <cit> . however, altitudinal patterns of microbial community have not been well studied and remain poorly understood compared to macroorganisms diversity that have been studied for centuries  <cit> . bacterial diversity and abundance probably is reduced with altitude and influenced by ecological and geological factors such as vegetation, temperature and ph level etc. that establish complex interaction  <cit> . several studies did not observe similar types of consistent changes in microbial community along elevation gradients  <cit> . species of azotobacter chroococcum and azospirillum brasilense were reported as dominant nitrogen fixing bacteria at high altitude  <cit> . seasonal variations have influenced on bacterial community diversity and abundance within taxa in colorado mountains. the acidobacterium division was most abundant in spring. winter community had the highest proportion of actinobacteria and members of the cytophaga/flexibacter/bacteroides division. however, some of the species resist temperature fluctuations, e.g. the α–proteobacteria  <cit> . further studies that parallelly investigate empirical patterns of plants, animals and microorganisms will provide a better sketch of diversity patterns in major environmental gradients of earth, and will predict system wide ecological responses to climatic changes  <cit> .

saudi arabia represents almost 80% of the arabian peninsula  <cit> , and at least one–third of its land is desert  <cit> . saudi arabia is generally known for high temperature and low rainfall with exception of the southwestern highlands that are covered by diverse forests  <cit> . according to the report of darfaoui and assiri  <cit> , saudi arabia is more vulnerable to climate change, and forecasted temperature increase in this region is higher compared to an average increase in the global temperature along with high moisture in the western highlands of the country. so far no study has been conducted to document the soil microbial community in this geographically distinct region with unique environmental conditions. in this study, soil samples were collected from the southwestern highlands of saudi arabia at different elevational gradients to document bacterial community composition using high throughput next generation sequencing targeting hypervariable v <dig> region of 16s rrna gene. in future prospective, the study would help us to understand the impact of climate change in this region on microbial community composition and their possible consequences on flora and fauna.

bacterial community composition
in this study, we obtained a total of  <dig> raw sequence reads from  <dig> samples utilizing roche 454-flx titanium instruments. after sequence processing,  <dig> number of high quality sequence reads  were obtained and assigned to bacteria domain. the average reads number were 5861 ±  <dig> sequences per sample.

bacterial community compositions of the collected soil samples were studied at descending levels of taxonomic classification to find out community membership at different altitudes in the southwestern highlands of saudi arabia. overall,  <dig> phyla were found across the samples, including a group of unclassified sequences. twelve phyla were commonly detected within the studied samples. the relative abundances of dominant phyla are presented in figure  <dig>  only eight phyla were comprised mean abundance more than 1% in each sample, but they jointly hold  <dig> % of the total sequence reads. most dominant phylum was proteobacteria with mean relative abundance value of  <dig> % ±  <dig>  and dominantly detected in ≥20% concentration within all samples except from swh <dig> . other dominant phyla were actinobacteria and acidobacteria representing bacterial sequences in the range of  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> %, respectively. an average  <dig> % of the sequences were unclassified. concentration of the unclassified sequences were fluctuated in the studied samples, and the sample swh <dig> contained highest  <dig> % unclassified sequences. there were also identified certain members of chloroflexi , bacteroidetes , firmicutes , planctomycetes  and gemmatimonadetes , and were designated as minor phyla detected in lower concentration. of these groups, firmicutes and bacteroidetes were detected in higher concentration  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively in the sample swh <dig> compared to the other samples. the remaining identified phyla/candidate divisions represent much smaller fraction  of the bacterial community.figure  <dig>

taxonomic analysis revealed  <dig> otus including a group of  <dig>  unclassified otus at class level. members from actinobacteria  dominated the actinobacteria phylum, occupying  <dig> % of the total sequence reads, but were showing high variability ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  % within the samples. class α–proteobacteria occupied  <dig> % of the total sequence reads and was dominating phylum proteobacteria ranging from  <dig> – <dig> % within the samples compared to other proteobacteria classes, β–proteobacteria , γ–proteobacteria  and δ–proteobacteria . members of the class acidobacteria– <dig>  and thermoleophilia  were commonly detected within the samples. statistically, only the distribution of rarely detected classes, solibacteres , actinobacteria mb*2a– <dig> and unclassified class of verrucomicrobia present in <1% concentration of the total sequence reads were significantly different  between the groups of samples collected at elevation of  <dig> meter below and above.

all the sequence reads were assigned into  <dig> otus at the family level of the taxonomy. out of  <dig>  the  <dig>  otus were unclassified to any define family. average,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  otus at family level were observed per sample. fifty seven otus were commonly detected within samples and were representing 74% of the total sequence reads. only few otus were present exclusively in each sample with mean relative abundance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ranged . maximum number of unique family level otus were identified in the sample swh <dig> and minimum number in swh <dig> . the highest diversity was observed in the sample swh <dig> containing  <dig> taxa at family level followed by swh <dig> , swh <dig>  and swh <dig> . apart from unclassified taxa otus, other dominant taxa at family level were actinomycetales fam. , micromonosporaceae , geodermatophilaceae , chloracidobacteria fam.  and acidobacteria– <dig> fam.  <dig> . all the dominant families >1% mean concentration were commonly present within the studied samples except from clostridiaceae  that was detected at  <dig> % in sample swh <dig> and present at a rare concentration in the other  <dig> samples swh <dig>  swh <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig> figure  <dig>

overall,  <dig> otus were found at genus level taxonomic classification in the total sequence reads. among those, only  <dig> otus were assigned to defined genera. the  <dig> otus were commonly detected within the analyzed samples and were representing  <dig> % of the total sequence reads. only few otus were present specifically per studied samples ranged from 6– <dig>  maximum number of unique  <dig> otus at genus level were identified in the sample swh <dig> . on average,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  otus at genus level were identified per sample, and highest diversity was observed in the sample swh <dig> containing  <dig> taxa followed by swh <dig>  and swh <dig> . the genera from following groups actinomycetales, chloracidobacteria, geodermatophilaceae, acidobacteria– <dig>  rhizobiales, betaproteobacteria, micromonosporaceae, solirubrobacterales, alphaproteobacteria and pseudonocardia were dominantly detected at level of >1% concentration in each sample.

pyrosequencing data statistical analyses
chao <dig> index, rarefaction and the shannon index were calculated to estimate the alpha diversity. total  <dig> otus  were found in the complete data set of processed sequence reads. chao <dig> analysis revealed a decreased trend of richness in the samples swh <dig>  swh <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig> compared to the samples swh <dig>  swh <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig> . the highest richness value of chao <dig> was found in sample swh <dig>  and lowest in swh <dig> . in rarefaction curves, all the studied samples were tended to approach saturation plateau, and the samples swh <dig>  shw <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig> were plotted in the upper part of the graph . the rarefaction curve indicated variation in otus density within the soil samples collected from different altitudes and locations, but the sequence coverage was still sufficient to capture the diversity of bacterial community. the shannon wiener index calculated at 3% dissimilarity showed the lowest value of evenness  for the sample swh <dig> compared to the all other samples that revealed the highest value of evenness . statistically, no significant difference was observed in the choa <dig> and the shannon wiener index between the groups of samples collected at different altitudes.figure  <dig>

jackknifed pcoa was performed using unifrac metrics to compare overall composition of bacterial community within the samples and to cluster the bacterial community along axes of maximal variance according to their diversity  and concentration . jackknifed unweighted pcoa explained relatively small variation  along the first three axes . jackknifed weighted pcoa explained 64% of variation along the first three axes demonstrating that overall differences between bacterial communities within the samples were more related to the richness of specific taxa otus compared to their presence or absence . in the three-dimensional plot visualized from unifrac unweighted distance matrix pcoa, samples swh <dig>  swh <dig>  swh <dig> grouped in one cluster and samples swh <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig> made another cluster. the other four samples were scattered in the plot. the samples were broadly distributed along pc <dig>  pc <dig> and pc <dig> in the weighted distance matrix principle coordinate plot except for the sample shw <dig> and swh <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
natural ecosystem in the western highlands of saudi arabia is susceptible to climate change as result of global warming, overgrazing and expansion of uncontrolled urbanization that is leading to changes in species composition, richness and a decrease in biodiversity  <cit> . presently, western highlands of saudi arabia are experiencing a drastic shift from ruler to urban environment and population influx. urbanization has detrimental effects on soil ecosystems and microbial community  <cit> . according to gcm models, expected average warming in saudi arabia for the year  <dig> will be higher than the global average  <cit> . therefore, it is critical to document the ecosystem, particularly the poorly studied microbial community over different parts of the country and to plan for the sustaining of local ecosystems in the western highlands.

we investigated the soil bacterial community composition and soil residues along an altitude in the southwestern highlands of saudi arabia, where the ecosystem is expected to be more fragile with respect to climate change  <cit> . we found that neither bacterial diversity nor soil physicochemical properties showed consistent changes with altitude. there were no significant differences observed in ph level at different altitudes. similarly, tukey hsd analysis indicated that the concentration of som and total nitrogen were not significantly different within the samples swh <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig> collected at different altitudes. previously, it was reported that microbial flora does not affect by altitude. physicochemical factors such as som, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity and ph changed with altitude  <cit> . the relation between som and altitude increased linearly in grassland soil  <cit> . generally, effect of altitude on soil chemistry is dependent on vegetation, climate and environmental ecology of the investigated study site  <cit> . overall, the concentration of som was less than 2% within each analyzed soil samples that limited to desert area and representing low–lying of som contents in the southwestern highlands of saudi arabia.

in order to understand bacterial diversity and community’s composition at southwestern highlands, we analyzed the output of 16s rrna gene sequence reads qualitatively and quantitatively. the identified otus unique to each sample were very low irrespective of the altitudinal level. the highest number of twenty six unique otus at genus level were identified in the sample swh <dig> collected at  <dig> meter height followed by  <dig> unique otus identified in the swh <dig> collected at  <dig> meter height. maximum diversity was detected in the samples swh <dig>  swh <dig> and swh <dig>  respectively collected at different altitudinal level. consistent with several previous studies, soil from the southwestern highlands at different altitudes were dominated by the conserved set of phyla proteobacteria, actinobacteria and acidobacteria that were commonly detected in different types of soil such as agriculture, forest and arctic  <cit> . it suggests the presence of a well adapted soil core bacterial community that is resistant to environmental disturbance factors and commonly present in different types of soil. however, the overall similarities and dissimilarities are associated with the soil type acting as a dominant factor driving bacterial community composition  <cit> . for example, phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes were detected at higher concentrations in sample swh <dig> compared to the other samples. this difference may be attributed to the sedimentary nature of soil collected around a lake and vegetation of the sampling site. similar structure in microbial community was detected along different alpine vegetative zones and altitudinal gradients from 900– <dig> meters in the austrian limestone alps  <cit> , and in the soil from the bornean tropical forest at altitudinal gradients   <cit> . margesin et al.  <cit>  reported a decrease in microbial activity and shift in microbial community composition with altitude in the grossglockner mountain area of the austrian central alps. probably, the apparent inconsistency between the studies may be due to difference in the study sties, climate, elevation increments and vegetation or methodology used for assessment of microbial community composition. several researchers identified significant influence of vegetation and plant species over microbial flora  <cit>  and soil chemistry  <cit> . in this study, we did not focus on the association of plant species specific interaction with microbial community at the sampling sites that were mainly covered by the scattered density of juniperus procera followed by acacia spp. olea europaea and shrubs. ushio et al.  <cit>  revealed the indirect role of plant species in regulation of soil microbial community composition mainly through their effects on soil physicochemical properties such as ph, total carbon and nitrogen etc. the interaction between plants, soil chemistry, microorganism and other ecological factors is quite complex phenomena that drives the ecosystem functions and any alteration in these factors might affect the microbial community composition and the ecological processes  <cit> .

interestingly, the majority of sequence reads from all the analyzed samples were not classified to any defined taxonomy units at and below family level. it is consistent with the previous studies investigated untouched environments such as antarctica, and found a unique type of flora that showed lower similarities with 16s rrna gene sequences retrieved from other environmental samples  <cit> . it should be noted, there are few limitations exist in our study that include selection of few sampling sites as a proxy to assess the western highland of saudi arabia, although the studied sites have a representative landscape of southwestern highlands. our results based on single time point sampling and seasonal dynamics might affect the microbial community’s diversity and composition. in fact, some previous studies have noticed that long–term patterns of subsurface microbial community are likely to remain generally intact  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
analysis indicated that bacterial community within soil samples collected from southwestern highlands of saudi arabia were similar but not identical, and did not show a consistent shift with altitudinal level. overall,  <dig> phyla were commonly found across the samples and a group of core dominant phyla proteobacteria, actinobacteria and acidobacteria reported previously from other different types of soil. members from the phyla chloroflexi, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, planctomycetes and gemmatimonadetes were present in lower abundance. pcoa analysis revealed, overall differences between the samples were more related to the abundance of specific otus than to their presence or absence. there is need of further studies to investigate the microbial community in conjunction with other ecological parameters in the western highlands of saudi arabia. because it may encounter catastrophic shifts due to urbanization and climate change.
