BACKGROUND
all animal species have evolved a metabolic response system allowing them to survive during periods of energy deprivation. the overall metabolic response to fasting operates at numerous levels and has been relatively well characterized in mammals  <cit> . in vertebrates, the liver plays a central role in this adaptive response. deprivation of food inhibits lipogenesis and induces the release of large amounts of fatty acids from the adipose tissue, which are taken up by the liver and oxidized in the peroxisome and/or mitochondria via beta-oxidation. the majority of fatty acids are only partially oxidized to acetyl-coenzyme a , which then condenses with itself to form ketone bodies, an important fuel for the brain. the energy released in the process of beta-oxidation is used by the liver to carry out gluconeogenesis from substrates such as glycerol, lactate, and amino acids.

several studies showed that the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and the induction of gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation in response to fasting result from changes in mrna level of genes encoding enzymes and transcription regulators involved in these metabolisms  <cit> . several studies using ppara-null mice  <cit>  have demonstrated a key role of ppara in this response. although microarray-based experiments have been widely used to identify differentially expressed genes involved in numerous biological processes, only few studies have considered the effect of fasting on large-scale hepatic gene profiles. data are available in the mouse  <cit> , the pig  <cit>   and more recently the rainbow trout  <cit>  and the rat  <cit> . in the present study, the chicken species was chosen as an important model organism that bridges the evolutionary gap between mammals and other vertebrates; a divergence that occurred about  <dig> million years ago. previous studies have shown that the activities or expression of hepatic enzymes involved in lipogenesis, beta-oxidation and gluconeogenesis  and plasma metabolites and hormones levels  were altered during fasting in chickens. overall the available data show that chickens share most metabolic responses with mammals despite some distinct features. in birds lipogenesis occurs essentially in the liver  <cit>  contrary to rodents or pigs in which it is regulated in both liver and adipose tissue. regulation of gluconeogenesis differs too, essentially due to intracellular location of key enzymes  <cit> . chicken plasma metabolites have different levels from those reported for mammals, especially glucose which is higher. to extend and complete previous studies conducted on candidate genes, the present study aimed to describe the evolution of global gene expression profiles in chicken liver during a  <dig> h fasting period by using pangenomic oligo microarrays. the second reason to choose chicken as model is that this species provides a major protein source from meat throughout the world and the excessive accumulation of lipids in birds is one of the main problems facing this industry. to our knowledge, no whole genome survey of hepatic gene expression has been reported in chickens so far  <cit> . the use of a recently available  <dig> k oligo microarray allowed us to make the first description of the alteration of hepatic gene profiles induced by fasting in this species and make some hypothesis on the regulatory mechanisms involved at the mrna level. the genes showing a significant alteration in their expression profile during fasting were grouped in four clusters of co-expressed genes by a two-way hierarchical clustering analysis. further interpretation was based on the use of different gene annotation databases  highlighting numerous biological processes modulated by fasting.

RESULTS
experimental and microarray setup
to evaluate the changes in hepatic gene expression in response to starvation,  <dig> week-old male chickens were submitted to  <dig>   <dig> h or  <dig> h of food withdrawal. transcriptome profiling of these "fed", "fst16" and "fst48" nutritional stages was carried out by using a  <dig> k microarray. the expression data of the  <dig> gene set from  <dig> independent oligochips was normalized by "lowess-fitness". of the  <dig> oligos present on the microarray,  <dig> aligning with a unique coding region of the  <dig>  washington university assembly of the chicken sequence genome, were chosen for statistical analyses. the expression data were further analyzed by analysis of variance with the ebayes procedure  <cit>  using limma package  to identify differentially expressed genes between either of the two fasting states and the fed state. clusters of co-expressed genes were identified by two-way hierarchical cluster analysis and the degree of importance of each gene in this cluster identification was explored by principal component analysis. gene ontology, kegg and ingenuity databases were used for further interpretation, as  <dig> genes  presented a human ortholog with a hugo symbol allowing us to recover functional annotations from those databases.

the microarray data results were deposited in the gene expression omnibus  public repository . the accession number for the series is gse <dig> and the sample series can be retrieved with accession number gsm <dig>  gsm <dig>  and gsm <dig> up to gsm <dig>  the sample series contains for each microarray the raw data  of each cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels as well as the normalized data )

a high number of genes differentially expressed between the two fasting states and the fed state
a high number of gene transcripts were significantly altered by fasting, so that we considered only those presenting an amplitude of variation higher than +/- 40% between fasting and fed conditions . the percentage of genes presenting such a modulation increased lower pvalues were choosen, for example for a cut-off fixed to  <dig> , it increased from 58% with a pvalue of  <dig>  to 95% with a pvalue of  <dig> . in the present study, the  <dig> genes that satisfied the criterion of pvalue <  <dig>  and absolute fold-change >  <dig>  were considered for further analysis. among these genes, the number of regulated genes was  <dig> -fold higher after  <dig> h of fasting than after  <dig> h. we further performed a global analysis of the  <dig> genes fulfilling those conditions and for which annotation could be retrieved through their human ortholog . the selected  <dig>  pvalue that was corrected according to the false discovery rate  of benjamini-hochberg  <cit>  ensures in average a number of false positive of  <dig> genes in this selected gene set. in this set,  <dig> genes were altered after  <dig> h of fasting,  <dig> after  <dig> h of fasting, and  <dig> after  <dig> h and  <dig> h .

a two-way hierarchical cluster analysis  was applied to the normalized dataset to identify clusters among the  <dig> animals and these  <dig> genes . as expected, the animal dendrogram clearly separated the three nutritional conditions: the fst <dig> state was more distant from the fed state than the fst <dig> state. the dendrogram also showed a higher homogeneity between individuals intra than inter nutritional conditions, showing that the number of chickens analyzed by condition was appropriate for such a study.

for the gene variables, four clusters were identified. the clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  were respectively down- and up-regulated after  <dig> h of fasting. the majority of genes in cluster  <dig>  were also significantly down-regulated after  <dig> h of fasting, but with an amplitude similar to that observed after  <dig> h. the majority of genes in cluster  <dig>  returned to fed levels by  <dig> h of fasting. the clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  corresponded to the genes respectively down- and up-regulated only after  <dig> h of fasting. altogether, the number of genes significantly down-regulated by fasting was higher than the number of genes up-regulated:  <dig> versus  <dig> genes. only  <dig> genes  were regulated in an opposite way between the fst <dig> and fst <dig> states. the list of the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes with the associated cluster is presented in an additional file  <dig> 

in complement to the hca, principal components analysis  allowed to identify the genes contributing most to the separation of individuals. the first two components of pca  clearly separated the three nutritional conditions  and about 80% of the genes showed a high correlation with the two principal components  . further analysis of the whole dataset was then considered to identify the main biological processes regulated by fasting.

annotation of gene clusters using gene ontology , kegg and ingenuity databases
gene ontology  terms have been widely used as a tool for a global interpretation of microarray data. table  <dig> indicates the biological process go terms enriched for each of the  <dig> clusters obtained by hca . the most over-represented go terms  concerned "lipid biosynthesis", "fatty acid biosynthesis" corresponding to genes down-regulated after  <dig> h of fasting  and "fatty acid beta-oxidation" and "gluconeogenesis" corresponding to genes up-regulated after  <dig> h of fasting . these observations were consistent with those already reported in mammals.

the pathways sub-lined were found in at least two of the three analyses. <dig> biological process go terms obtained by the gene ontology tree machine software . are only indicated the enriched biological process go terms with a significant level of pvalue <  <dig>   and a minimum of  <dig> genes associated.  <dig> kegg pathways: are only indicated those with a minimum of  <dig> genes associated and having a probability to be observed in the cluster 4-fold superior than the probability to obtain it by chance. <dig> ingenuity pathways: are indicated the top five canonical pathways associated to each cluster . only canonical pathways with at least  <dig> genes affiliated were conserved.

among the enriched go terms of the cluster  <dig>  were "glycolysis", "regulation of protein catabolism" and surprisingly "cell cycle" with more than  <dig> genes associated. of the six genes associated with "glycolysis", pkm <dig> encodes a pyruvate kinase that catalyses an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. ate <dig> and mdm <dig>  two genes annotated as involved in the "regulation of protein catabolism" are part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. no enriched go terms was found for the cluster  <dig> 

the biological interpretation of the gene clusters was further completed using kegg database  <cit>  and ingenuity pathway analysis . the significant kegg and ipa pathways are indicated in table  <dig> with the genes associated. ipa and kegg pathway analyses highlighted some biological processes already revealed by go analysis, plus other ones, showing the interest in combining different sources of annotation. cluster  <dig>  down-regulated at  <dig> h of fasting, was mainly characterized by genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis, through the annotation terms "lipid metabolism", "lipid biosynthesis", "carboxylic acid biosynthesis", "fatty acid biosynthesis". lipogenic genes , cholesterogenic genes  and genes involved in triglyceride synthesis  were found in the list. cluster  <dig>  up-regulated at  <dig> h of fasting, was essentially characterized by genes involved in fatty acid metabolism/oxidation and acetyl-coa metabolism through the annotation terms "fatty acid beta-oxydation", "energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds", "gluconeogenesis", "ppar signalling pathway", "synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies", "citrate cycle tca cycle" and "pyruvate metabolism". the list comprised genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation , ketogenesis , gluconeogenesis  and fatty acid transport or activation . cluster  <dig>  down-regulated at  <dig> h of fasting, was essentially characterized by genes involved in "glycolysis" , "cell cycle"  and  <dig> signalling pathways including "insulin signaling pathway" and "estrogen receptor signaling". cluster  <dig>  up-regulated at  <dig> h of fasting, was associated to various annotation terms, notably "camp-mediated signaling" linked to glucagon/insulin balance.

following this global overview of the data, we chose to focus on genes regulated by the first  <dig> hours of fasting  that were involved in "lipid biosynthesis", "fatty acid beta-oxidation", "ketogenesis" and "gluconeogenesis". several genes were chosen for validation of the microarray results using quantitative rt-pcr. a further group of genes encoding fads <dig> and fads <dig> desaturases and transcriptional factors known to be important regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism were also considered.

genes involved in fatty acid- and cholesterol-synthesis and in fatty acid beta-oxidation, ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis
validation by qrt-pcr
twenty four genes involved in peroxisomal or mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids, in ketogenesis, in gluconeogenesis and in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis were present on the microarrays, respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes. as indicated in figure 4-a, after  <dig> h of fasting, all lipogenic genes and cholesterogenic genes were significantly down-regulated, except hmgcr no regulated and hmgcs <dig> up-regulated. by contrast, all genes involved in ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial or peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation were significantly up-regulated, except ehhadh and hmgcs <dig>  the highest amplitudes of up-regulations were observed for cpt1a, peci, acaa <dig>  acox <dig>  hmgcl, pck <dig> . the genes acly, fasn, me <dig> and scd were down-regulated by 2-fold. to confirm these microarray data,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed after  <dig> h of fasting were analyzed by qrt-pcr . the results confirmed the microarray analyses, but higher amplitudes of variation were generally measured by qrt-pcr. notably, the up-regulation of the hmgcs <dig> gene during fasting was largely confirmed . the  <dig> genes hmgcr, ehhadh and hmgcs <dig> not found significantly differentially expressed by microarray were analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr as well. ehhadh was up-regulated during fasting  and hmgcr down-regulated, as described in mammals. by contrast, hmgcs <dig> was found significantly up-regulated but only after  <dig> h of fasting. overall these results are consistent with those reported in mammals except for the gene hmgcs <dig>  which could show species specific patterns of regulation.

expression of genes encoding srebp- <dig>  ppara, srebp- <dig> and nr1h <dig> transcription factors
because peroxysome proliferators-activated receptor alpha , sterol regulatory element binding protein  <dig> and  <dig>  and nuclear receptor subfamily  <dig>  group h, member  <dig> , have been identified in mammals as critical transcription factors for the regulation of hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation, fatty acid synthesis or cholesterol metabolism  <cit> , we measured their expression by quantitative rt-pcr . 
ppara: we observed an up-regulation of ppara in chicken livers after fasting . the correlations at the mrna level between ppara and its putative targets in chickens  were significantly high:  <dig>  to  <dig>  using the qrt-pcr expressions of the  <dig> chickens in fed, fst <dig> and fst <dig> states. using the  <dig>  washington university assembly of the gallus gallus genome sequence, the upstream sequences of those genes were screened for a putative ppara response element . as indicated in table  <dig>  potential ppre were identified in acox <dig>  cpt <dig> and hmgcs <dig>  
srebp1: the first  <dig> h of fasting caused a significant repression of the hepatic expression of srebp <dig> . the correlations between srebp <dig> and its putative targets in chickens  at the mrna level were significantly high . 
srebp2: the transcriptional factor srebp <dig> regulates the expression of many genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. we observed by qrt-pcr a decrease of srebp <dig> gene expression after fasting,  correlated to hmgcr gene expression. microarray results also indicated a 2-fold decreased expression of genes encoding cyp51a <dig>  and lss , other enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis. by contrast, hmgcs <dig> was strongly up-regulated during starvation. 
nr1h3: nr1h <dig> mrna level was significantly increased  after  <dig> h of fasting and remained unchanged after  <dig> h whereas genes known to be its direct targets in mammals were down-regulated by fasting. it was the case for the lipogenic genes srebp <dig>  fasn and scd and for cyp7a <dig>  encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol degradation to bile acids.

ppre patterns used for the research is indicated in bold with the reference associated. gga: gallus gallus; hsa: homo sapiens; mus: mus musculus. nucleic acids in red indicate conserved nucleic acids with the ppres used for the research. location: genomic location refers to the start of the ensembl first exon . strand: "rc" indicates that the sequence is reverse complemented compared to the genomic sequence displayed at that location, otherwise a "+" is indicated. stan or paster indicates that the ppre has been identified either by stan or patser softwares respectively . for the acox <dig> gene, despite previous results indicating ppre in the mus musculus promoting dna sequence  <cit> , we cannot found any ppre with the stan procedure in any species. we used another ppre pattern  <cit>  identified in the rattus norvegicus dna sequence. this pattern allowed us to identify potential ppre in gallus gallus and mus musculus sequences. the absence of result in the homo sapiens sequence was consistent with the literature  <cit> .

expression of genes involved in desaturation of fatty acids
go term, ipa and kegg pathway analyses highlighted scd which is considered as an enzyme involved in mono-unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. however, scd  belongs to the fatty acid desaturase family, which also includes fads <dig>  and fads <dig> , two key enzymes for the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids. we observed that fasting resulted in a 14- to 18-fold inhibition of scd expression . a significant repression was observed for both fads <dig> and fads <dig> genes but only after  <dig> h of fasting . the data show that the expression profiles of scd gene and the two fads <dig> and fads <dig> genes were different in response to fasting in chickens.

discussion
to date few studies have reported global gene expression surveys in chickens. wang et al  <cit>  provided an analysis of the chicken adipose tissue gene expression profile using a  <dig> k genechip chicken genome array . other hepatic transcriptional analyses have been reported but using only dedicated chicken microarrays:  <dig>  k liver-specific microarray  <cit>  or a  <dig> cdna microarray  <cit> . although microarray studies are more numerous in mammalian species, only few studies have considered global gene expression of the liver tissue in response to fasting. the effect of fasting has been studied in the liver of mice fasted during  <dig> h or  <dig> h using a  <dig> k oligo microarray  <cit>  and in the liver of rats fasted during  <dig> h with a  <dig> k oligo-chip  <cit> . one study was conducted in the liver of pigs fasted during  <dig> h which used a  <dig> cdna microarray  <cit> , and more recently one was conducted in the liver of trouts submitted to  <dig> weeks of food deprivation which used a  <dig> k microarray  <cit> . in the present study, we analyzed the hepatic expression of  <dig> genes in  <dig> week-old chickens, submitted to  <dig> h or  <dig> h of starvation. of the  <dig> annoted genes on the microarray , we observed  <dig> genes with an amplitude of variation higher than +/- 40% at pvalue below  <dig>  . because our gene selection satisfied the criterion of fdr < 1%  our results could be considered as reliable; and indeed all the differential genes tested were confirmed by qrt-pcr. it remains, however, that the amplitude of the differences measured by qrt-pcr were generally higher than those measured using microarrays. this may explain why ehhadh, hmgcr and hmgcs <dig> were observed as differentially expressed by qrt-pcr but not by microarray; and it may suggest that the microarray analyses based on hybridization technique is more hampered by proportion of false negative compared to qrt-pcr analyses because of the lack of an amplification step. the list of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the chicken liver after starvation is available in additional file  <dig> 

the main observation was that a high number of genes were regulated by fasting in chicken liver and in a time dependent manner: the expression of  <dig> genes was altered by  <dig> h of fasting versus that of  <dig> genes was altered by  <dig> h. in mouse liver, bauer et al   <cit>  made a similar observation  even if the number of differential genes was lower compared to the present study. another important observation was that the number of genes down-regulated by fasting was higher than the number of genes up-regulated, whatever the duration of fasting :  <dig> genes versus  <dig> genes respectively. among the  <dig> genes annoted as enzymes that represented 16% of the genes annoted,  <dig> genes  were down-regulated. numerous reports have shown that birds are relatively resistant to long period of starvation  <cit> . this is the case for chickens which resist to longer period of starvation than mice  <cit> . four week old chickens survive starvation periods of more than  <dig> days  <cit> , loosing about 37% of body weight during this period. this suggests that the severity of a  <dig> h fasting period is limited. however, our observations suggest a global repression of the cellular activity in response to short-term starvation .

principal components analysis clearly separated the three nutritional conditions; the most  of the differentially expressed genes were correlated with the two principal components and so contributed to distinguish the three states. by a two-way hierarchical clustering analysis,  <dig> clusters were identified:  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes up-regulated after  <dig> h of fasting, most of them showing a similar pattern at  <dig> h of fasting. a prolonged starvation up to  <dig> h repressed  <dig> and induced  <dig> gene expressions. we then used the three databases, gene ontology, kegg and ingenuity to analyze the  <dig> gene clusters. these databases supply a useful tool for a global biological interpretation of microarray data. we can however notice some contradictions which could be due to the imperfection of these annotations. first, a biological process could be highlighted through genes which are not key regulators of this process but only indirectly involved in it. as an illustration, the "valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation" process was cited from kegg and ipa databases in cluster  <dig> through genes involved in ketogenesis  even though the first key enzyme of this pathway, bcat <dig>  was absent of this cluster and belonged to cluster  <dig>  second, the allocation of a gene to a pathway may not always be optimal. for example, gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase , was associated to the "lysine degradation pathway" in kegg and ipa databases while this enzyme catalyses carnitine biosynthesis and should therefore be associated to "fatty acid beta-oxidation" process in which carnitine is essential for mitochondrial beta-oxidation  <cit> . another limitation may arise from the fact that some particular genes may not be annoted by automatic annotation processes. for instance, the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase  <dig> gene  was not cited in the "gluconeogenesis" pathway associated to the cluster  <dig>  whereas pdk <dig> phosphorylates and inhibits the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and thus promotes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, which is used in the liver for gluconeogenesis. other genes important in the "lipid biosynthesis" process and associated to cluster  <dig> were also not highlighted: insulin receptor signaling gene  or insulin induced gene  which mediate feedback control of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis by controlling srebp cleavage-activating protein  involved in the regulation of cleavage of sterol response element binding proteins . considering these imperfections, the annotation results require an expert biological knowledge to validate them and draw up precise comments and this is a limit to the full interpretation of pangenomic microarray data. however, the use of such databases, in particular when several are combined as in the present study, remains a first and useful step for a global biological interpretation as it allows highlighting the major pathways involved.

in the present study, the go, kegg and ipa annotation results taken together are complementary and allow us to draw up the following overview about the general biological mechanisms associated with each cluster. first, and as could be expected, they point out to an alteration of lipid and acetyl-coa metabolisms during the first  <dig> h of fasting : lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes were down-regulated whereas genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation, ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis and fatty acid activation or transport were up-regulated. these results are in agreement with the previously reported alterations of glucose and lipid metabolisms in response to short-term starvation in rodents  <cit> , pigs  <cit>  and chickens  <cit> . second and less expected, they highlight a number of cell signalling pathways which would seem to be altered between  <dig> h and  <dig> h of fasting . notably, genes in the "insulin signalling cascade" would seem to be repressed whereas genes in the "camp-mediated signalling" pathway would seem to be enhanced. more than ten signalling response pathways were identified in cluster  <dig> , suggesting a general repression of signalling pathways at  <dig> h of starvation. many genes associated with these pathways are implicated in cellular responses, also involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. precise comments about them would need an expert biological knowledge.

because ppara, srebp <dig>  srebp- <dig> and nr1h <dig> have been identified in mammals as critical transcription factors for the regulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation, fatty acid synthesis or cholesterol metabolism, we examined their expressions by qrt-pcr.

definite proof that ppara plays a key role in the up-regulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation, ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis in the liver during starvation comes from several studies using ppara-null  mice. using a gene-by-gene approach, these studies identified ppara target genes  <cit> . short-term fasting  in ko mice resulted in hepatic steatosis and hypoketonemia. our observations also suggest a critical role of ppara in the up-regulation of these metabolisms in chicken liver in response to fasting. first, we observed a marked induction of ppara expression after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of fasting, confirming earlier results by cogburn et al  <cit>  in the same species. second, we identified potential ppre in avian genes acox <dig>  cpt <dig> and hmgcs <dig> involved respectively in peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation and ketogenesis. third we observed a significant correlation between ppara and acox <dig>  ehhadh, cpt <dig> mrna levels. fourth, within the  <dig> genes showing the highest level of induction following  <dig> h of fasting , we found  <dig> genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation , ketogenesis , or gluconeogenesis , the majority being direct targets of ppara.

by contrast, hepatic expression of srebp <dig>  decreased after the first  <dig> h of fasting. we also observed a significant correlation between srebp <dig> mrna levels and those of their putative target genes acly, acaca, fasn and scd. these results suggest a key role of srebp <dig> in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in chickens as already suggested by others studies carried out on the same species  <cit>  and demonstrated in rodents  <cit>  using  <dig> h of fasting.

srebp <dig> regulates the expression of many genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. cholesterol is an essential component of animal cell membranes, and its concentration is tightly controlled by a feedback system that operates at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels  <cit> . in the present study, we observed a decrease of srebp- <dig>  hmgcr, lss and cyp51a <dig> expressions during food deprivation. hmgcr is considered as the rate limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. these results suggest a decrease of cholesterol synthesis in response to starvation in chickens, as already reported in rodents after  <dig> h or  <dig> h of fasting  <cit> . however, hmgcs <dig> gene another gene involved in cholesterogenesis exhibited a strikingly different pattern of expression, with a marked induction at  <dig> h of fasting which is contrast with the repression of hmgcs <dig> expression observed during starvation in mice and pigs  <cit> . two distinct genes condense acetyl-coa with acetoacetyl-coa to form hmg-coa in the cell, the first one hmgcs <dig>  located in mitochondria is involved in ketogenesis, whereas the second one, hmgcs <dig> controls cholesterogenesis in the cytosol. like in other species, these two genes have been characterized in avian species  <cit> , allowing us to design gene specific oligonucleotides. four isoforms of the hmgcs <dig> enzyme have been described in chicken liver  <cit>  while only one was characterized in rat liver. the specific role of the  <dig> isozymes and the mechanism to generate them are not clear and must be clarified to better understand the species difference in hmgcs <dig> expression.

nr1h <dig>  is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family and was first discovered as playing a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid metabolism through the regulation of cyp7a <dig> , the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol degradation to bile acids  <cit>  it is also a master lipogenic transcription factor, directly regulating srebp <dig>  <cit> , fasn  <cit> , scd  <cit>  and chrebp genes  <cit> . we therefore expected its expression profile to parallel to those of its potential avian targets during the feeding-fasting transition. curiously, we observed that nr1h <dig> mrna level was increased at  <dig> h of fasting and returned to fed levels by  <dig> h. this result is consistent with a previous study conducted in rodents: rats fasted for  <dig> h increased lxra mrna level by 3-fold  <cit> . the role of nr1h <dig> during starvation remains to be elucidated.

we then studied the effects of fasting on the hepatic expressions of the three genes encoding the desaturases scd, fads <dig> and fads <dig>  scd  catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids  whereas fads <dig>  and fads <dig>  are two key enzymes for the synthesis of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids . all three mammalian desaturases are induced at the mrna levels by ppara  <cit>  and srebp <dig>  <cit> . this dual activation is a specificity of the desaturases compared to the enzymes of beta-oxydation or lipogenesis which are exclusively regulated by either ppara or srebp <dig> . in rodents, scd gene activity is completely repressed during fasting, like the activity of other lipogenic genes  and srebp <dig>  <cit> . we observed the same regulation for the chicken scd gene: the first  <dig> h of fasting resulted in a 14-fold inhibition of its expression and lasted up to  <dig> h of fasting. because of their common regulation by srebp <dig> and ppara, similar modulations could be expected for the three genes in response to fasting. by contrast, we observed that fads <dig> and fads <dig> genes were only significantly repressed after  <dig> h of fasting . in pig liver, scd and fads <dig> were down-regulated after  <dig> h of fasting  <cit> . to our knowledge, no data about the fads <dig> and fads <dig> expression modulation in response to fasting are available in rodents. this difference of modulation between scd gene and the two genes fads <dig> and fads <dig> in response to short-fasting suggest an additional regulatory mechanism between scd <dig> and these two latter genes. such a hypothesis was already done by matsuzaka et al  <cit> , from their data obtained during fasting-refeeding treatment in which no changes of fads <dig> and fads <dig> expression contrary to the lipogenic genes was observed. so, these two enzymes which play crucial roles in the production of hufa, might have an important role in fasted state because hufa were reported to inhibit srebp- <dig> activity by multiple mechanism  <cit>  and to be ligands of ppara.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we successfully used a chicken  <dig> k oligo microarrays to analyze the alteration of hepatic gene expression profile upon starvation. we identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the  <dig> h or  <dig> h fasting states and the fed state. we provide a valuable and publicly available resource of genes profiles altered during the first  <dig> h of starvation in chicken liver. after  <dig> h of fasting we observed an up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, gluconeogenesis and a down-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, which is consistent with earlier results obtained in mammals. after  <dig> h of fasting, when the number of genes showing an altered expression was much higher , the annotation data suggest a repression of genes involved in numerous signalling pathways. as a whole, we observed that more genes were down-regulated than up-regulated in response to starvation. the expression profiles of candidate genes encoding key transcription factors and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism but not present on the microarray were evaluated by qrt-pcr. the results were similar to those reported in mammals except for the gene hmgcs <dig>  which was induced at  <dig> h of fasting in chicken liver and repressed in mouse and pig liver. our data also suggest that the genes scd, fads <dig> and fads <dig> encoding different desaturases are regulated differently during fasting and nr1h <dig> is up-regulated at  <dig> h of fasting while one of its target, srebp <dig> is down-regulated. further studies should be performed to precise their role in the complex regulation array of lipid metabolism.
