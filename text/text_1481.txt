BACKGROUND
the past several decades have seen a number of methods applied to the computation of similarities between diseases  <cit> . the early work used clinical phenotypes or diagnosed information. for example, kalaria  <cit>  ascertained similarities between alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia by studying the similarities between disease symptoms and pathological result. more recently, with the availability of large-scale knowledge bases such as the online mendelian inheritance in man   <cit>  and the genetic association database   <cit> , scientists are able to explore the genetic similarity between diseases. in  <dig>  liu et al.  <cit>  revealed similarities between diseases by combining both genetic  and environmental  factors and, by mining for disease etiologies, created a new concept named the "etiome". zhang and his colleagues  <cit>  used a text-based method to build up a human disease phenotype network in which a disease was represented by a feature vector and the similarities between two diseases were calculated as the cosine of the angle between their corresponding feature vectors. however, little work has been done to apply semantic similarity measures between diseases using ontology, another way to analyze relationship between diseases.

understanding similarities between genes has a significant role to play in disease research. one hypothesis states that genes associated with similar diseases have similar functions; the greater the gene similarity the higher the probability that the genes are associated with similar similarity. however, current methods to determine gene similarity rely on sequence similarity, gene expression profiles, gene ontology   <cit>  annotations or pubmed abstracts, all of which are derived from normal or partially abnormal conditions and it secludes gene similarity from disease similarity. thus, a process to determine the similarities between genes in terms of diseases and to map gene similarities to disease similarities would help us better understand the mechanism of complex diseases.

the disease ontology  aims to provide an open source ontology for the integration of biomedical data that is associated with human disease  <cit> . the terms in do are disease names or disease-related concepts and are organised in a directed acyclic graph  . two linked diseases in do are in an 'is-a' relationship, which means one disease is a subtype of the other linked disease. and the lower a disease is in the do hierarchy, the more specific the disease term is. a recent work by osborne and his colleagues  <cit>  in which they used do to annotate the human genome, further advanced the application of do. recently, a simplified vocabulary list, disease ontology lite , was shown to give more interpretable results than do in gene-disease association tests. dolite has been used in fundo   <cit> , one of the few bioinformatics tools based on do that aims to explore disease information implied in the gene set. this work makes it possible to study disease similarity and gene similarity simultaneously in do using the annotated human genome. thus, we developed dosim, an r package for the computation of do-based similarity between diseases in an ontology sense. dosim was developed on do, subversion 926; the do term annotations of the human genes in dosim were taken from the study of osborne et al.  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes have been assigned do term annotations. compared with fundo, dosim divides functions into three categories:  measuring the similarity between diseases ,  measuring the similarity between human genes in terms of diseases,  other utilities for conducting do enrichment analysis , detecting and annotating do-directed gene modules, and describing and visualizing do structures and terms.

implementation
measuring the similarity between diseases
terms in do include disease names and disease-related concepts. exploring the similarity between them can help us to understand the relatedness between diseases. the past few years have seen an increase in the number of different measures used for the calculation of semantic similarity. based on the semantic similarity measures in the application of biomedical ontologies reviewed by pesquita etc al.  <cit> , for general applicability, in dosim we implemented ten representative semantic similarity measures, which are resnik measure  <cit> , lin measure  <cit> , jiang and conrath measure   <cit> , relevance measure   <cit> , graph information content measure   <cit> , information coefficient similarity measure   <cit> , wang measure  <cit> , modified resnik measure   <cit> , modified lin measure   <cit> , and modified jiang and conrath measure   <cit> . except for the wang measure that uses a hybrid measure, the other nine measures are based on information content .

the ic of a term/disease t in the do database gives a measure of how specific and informative a term/disease is, and is defined as ic = -log p, where p is the number of genes annotated to the term t and its descendants divided by the total number of genes annotated to do. when characterizing the shared ic between two terms, two concepts, most informative common ancestor  and disjunctive common ancestor , are widely used <cit> . the mica of two terms t <dig> and t <dig> is the one that possesses the maximum ic among all the common ancestor terms of the two terms. and the dcas of two terms t <dig> and t <dig> are the mica of disjunctive ancestors of the two terms, which can be defined as follows:   

where disjunctive ancestors of the term t, disjanc, can be described as that two ancestors a <dig> and a <dig> are disjunctive ancestors of the term t if there is a path from a <dig> to t not passing through a <dig> and a path from a <dig> to t not passing through a <dig>  it can be formulated as follows:   

then, the shared information of two terms t <dig> and t <dig>  share, is defined as the average of the ic of the dcas, formulated as:   

let tmica represent the mica term of two terms t <dig> and t <dig>  then the nine ic-based similarity measures are calculated as follows:                           

in the wang measure, each edge is given a weight according to the types of relationships. for a term a, a sub-dag comprised of the term a and all its ancestor terms can be represented as daga = , where ta is the ancestor term set of term a  and ea is the set of edges connecting to the terms in daga. for any term t in daga, wang et al.  <cit>  defined the semantic contribution of t to a, da, as the product of all the edge weights in the "best" path from term t to a, where the "best" path is the one that maximises the product . it can be represented as follow:   

where we is the semantic contribution factor of edge e . it is set between  <dig> and  <dig> according to the types of relationships, e.g., "is-a" or "part-of". in do, there is only one type of relationship, defined as "is-a". in dosim, we set we to  <dig> .

the semantic similarity between two terms a and b is then calculated as follows:   

where sv ) is the total semantic contribution of the term a  in daga , which is calculated as:      

measuring the similarity between human genes in terms of diseases
in the dosim package, the similarity between two genes based on the similarity of their do term annotation groups is calculated. each gene is represented by its set of direct do term annotations, and semantic similarity is calculated between terms in one set and terms in the other . some methods consider every pairwise combination of terms for the two sets, while others consider only the best-matching pair for each term. five different methods are implemented in dosim; they are the arithmetic maxima and average of pairwise similarity between two groups of do terms describing the two genes   <cit> , the arithmetic maxima and average between similarities for two directional comparisons of the similarity matrix s of two genes   <cit> , and the best-match average approach   <cit>  which considers the contributions from the semantically similar terms that annotated the two genes respectively .

let do <dig> and do <dig> be the groups of annotation terms for two genes g <dig> and g <dig>  and m and n are the number of terms in do <dig> and do <dig> respectively. a similarity matrix s=m×n contains all pairwise similarity scores of mappings from do <dig> to do <dig> when you refer to each row and vice verse when you refer to each column. 'rowscore' and 'columnscore' of s are the averages over the row maxima and the column maxima, which give similarity scores for the comparison of do <dig> to do <dig> and the comparison of do <dig> to do <dig>  respectively.      

using these definitions, the five similarity methods for the computation of gene similarity between two genes g <dig> and g <dig> are defined as follows:               

for a set of genes g  of size n, the similarity matrix for these genes is defined as sim=n×n, where simij is the similarity between gene g <dig> and gj derived by any of the five methods defined above.

in dosim, there are a total of fifty optional semantic similarity measures for genes, which are combinations of the ten semantic similarity measures for term pairs and the five similarity methods mentioned above.

other utilities
conducting do enrichment analysis
in dosim, do-based enrichment analysis is implemented to explore the disease feature of an independent gene set, for example, a differentially expressed gene set from a microarray analysis. significance of the enrichment analysis is assessed by the hypergeometric test and the p-value is adjusted by false discovery rate . for a certain do term t which meets the requirement , if m genes are the number of annotated genes in the human genome and x genes are the number of annotated genes in the gene set for this term, then to calculate whether the gene set is enriched in do term the following formula is used:   

where, n is the total number of human genes in the genome, k is the size of the gene set of interest, and  is the number of combinations of the n genes taken k at a time and is equal to .

compared with fundo, which uses a small set of do terms   <cit> , dosim selects the do terms satisfy two criteria for enrichment analysis, aiming at exploring more biological result. the first criterion is that the term should be annotated by at least n genes, and the second is that the term should be beneath a depth m in the dag of do, where n and m can be set by users when running the do enrichment analysis.

in the dosim package, the doenrichment function carries out the do enrichment analysis; the input is a list of entrez gene ids. the filter and layer parameters are the two criteria mentioned above that can be used to control the terms to be analysed; so that the term is annotated by at least 'filter size' genes and it is beneath the 'layer' depth in the dag of do.

detecting and annotating do-directed gene modules
a gene module is a group of highly correlated genes. in dosim, gene modules can be detected as follows: after the gene similarity matrix for a gene set is constructed, a hierarchical clustering is performed using the standard r function hclust and one of three branch cutting methods is applied   <cit> .

the dosim package incorporates multilayered enrichment analysis  to explore the biological meaning of the detected gene modules. the go annotations are conducted using gosim  <cit>  and the kegg annotations are generated using subpathwayminer  <cit> . the input for go and kegg annotations is a list of entrez gene ids, the mechanism implied in each annotation database is the hypergeometric test, and the outputs for each annotation database are the enriched terms with p-values.

describing and visualizing do structures and terms
do is a collection of terminologies associated with human diseases and the terms in do are organised in a dag . dosim also provides useful utilities to easily visualise the do structure; thus users need not turn to other tools . specifically, the hierarchical structures of do terms can be represented as a graphnel object and the getdograph function in dosim can be used to fetch the do graph with specified do terms at its leaves. for a certain do term, dosim provides a series of functions to extract related terms .

RESULTS
the effect of different measures on the computation of gene similarity
the different similarity measures for both the terms and the genes have their advantages when applied to biomedical ontologies  <cit> . an important question that we addressed was, do different similarity measures for the same gene pairs produce very different results? we used all the fifty similarity measures implemented in dosim to calculate the similarities between the  <dig> genes that have do annotations. a pearson correlation coefficient  analysis between the gene similarities calculated using the different similarity measures was then carried out to quantify the influence of the similarity measures. the resultant pcc frequency distribution  showed that the gene similarities calculated by the different similarity measures were closely correlated, indicating that the different similarity measures do not much significantly influence the computation of gene similarity.

application on disease similarity
we investigated the relationships between different kinds of cancers using disease similarities derived from dosim. first,  <dig> cancer disease do terms were obtained by using "cancer" as the key word to search all do term names . then, we used the gettermsim function to get the pairwise similarities using wang measure .

we also created a network representation to display all the  <dig> significant disease correlations by using the cytoscape software package  <cit>  . in the network, the nodes were diseases, and the thickness of the edges between two diseases represented their strength of correlation. the network revealed strong correlations between different modules , which helped us to pick additional significant disease associations that were missing in the hierarchical clustering. for example, germ cell cancer , a member of the module labelled in blue with size  <dig>  correlated with almost every member of the largest module of size  <dig>  this network application demonstrates that, although cancer diseases show modular characteristics, they are also highly correlated with each other. a detailed pairwise similarity matrix between the  <dig> cancer terms and a list of significant cancer pairs are provided in additional file  <dig> 

we also constructed the do graph of these  <dig> cancers as leaves , which finally contained  <dig> disease do terms. we found that, as expected, diseases in the same module represented hierarchical structure in the do graph as illustrated in the figure s <dig>  for example, the module marked brown contained  <dig> diseases, of which "cancer of urinary tract"  is the ancestral node of the other  <dig> diseases. however, the observed correlation between "germ cell cancer"  and the largest module which has a size of  <dig>  doesn't show any direct link in the do graph. again, the network representation in figure  <dig> provided additional insights to our analysis.

application on gene similarity
here, by discussing the disease risk of obesity, we demonstrated another application of dosim . previous studies showed that obesity increased the risk of various diseases, such as type  <dig> diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer  <cit> . in this example, we used obesity related genes  that were downloaded from the phenopedia database <cit> . of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> had do annotations. the similarities between these  <dig> genes were calculated using the bma method on the resnik measure . a gene similarity matrix s =  <dig> ×  <dig> was constructed where sij is the similarity between ith gene and jth gene in the gene set. after that an average linkage hierarchical clustering was performed and then a dynamic tree cutting method was applied   <cit> . finally,  <dig> different gene modules were obtained .

$ n/a indicates that there are no enriched go or kegg annotation for this module.

when the complete go and kegg annotations of these ten different gene modules were analysed , we found different enriched biology functions and pathways for each module, indicating the complex pathogenesis of obesity. for example, the kegg annotations of one of the clusters   indicated that obesity is a factor that may lead to various cancers  and that obesity may also have a relationship with many signalling pathways . however, the kegg annotations of another cluster  suggested that obesity may either affect the metabolism of many molecules or that the dysfunctional metabolism of these molecules may lead to the obesity . similarly, the go annotations of cluster m <dig> implied that obesity has a relationship with the biology process of cholesterol, lipoprotein and triglyceride , while the go annotations of cluster m <dig> suggested that obesity may be associated with eating habits . both the go and kegg annotations of cluster m <dig> indicated that obesity is related to coagulation . these multilayered annotations successfully demonstrated the complex pathogenesis of obesity and suggested that the genes in the different gene modules would be potential drug targets for the corresponding diseases caused by obesity.

discussion
the dosim package offers an easy and straight forward way to study disease similarity and gene similarity simultaneously in the do. additionally, other utilities implemented in the dosim, such as function of gene module detection and gene module multilayered annotation, make better application of the do and facilitate researchers. the presented two case studies highlight the usefulness of the dosim in a real life scenario. we also provided the additional file  <dig> which contains all the necessary r scripts to generate the above two case studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the dosim package advances the use of do by integrating information theoretic similarity concepts for diseases and deriving disease similarity measures for genes in the powerful r system. compared with the few existing bioinformatics tools for do, e.g., fundo, which explores disease information implied in the gene set by enrichment analysis, dosim focuses on the computation of disease-disease and gene-gene similarities. other utilities, such as function for gene module detection and gene module multilayered annotation, should help promote a better understanding of the complex pathogenesis of some disease risk phenotypes and the heterogeneity of some diseases. dosim is available on the comprehensive r archive network  project or through http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/dosim.
