BACKGROUND
fish myotomes are composed of anatomically segregated muscle fibre types each with distinct contractile and metabolic phenotypes  <cit> . based on their contractile speed skeletal muscle fibres are classified as slow, intermediate or fast  <cit> . fast twitch  muscle fibres comprise the bulk of the myotome and are recruited for energetic movements associated with prey capture and escape behaviour  <cit> . fast fibres have elevated densities of myofibrils, reduced myoglobin content and higher a capillary density than slow fibres and utilise phosphagen breakdown and anaerobic glycolysis to power contraction  <cit> . sustained swimming activity is supported by superficial layers of slow  and intermediate  twitch fibres which are recruited at slow and high cruising speeds respectively  <cit> . slow fibres have extensive lipid and glycogen stores, abundant mitochondria and high capillary densities reflecting their reliance on aerobic metabolism  <cit> . intermediate  muscle fibre types are found between the slow and fast fibre layers, but express distinct isoforms of myosin heavy chains  <cit>  and have intermediate contraction speeds and metabolic characteristics  <cit> .

muscle growth reflects the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. these two processes are influenced by numerous biotic and abiotic factors including food availability, growth factors, age, sex, diet composition, swimming activity, oxygen saturation, light and temperature  <cit> . the insulin-like growth factor  network, composed of igfs, binding proteins  and receptors , plays a pivotal role in integrating internal and external inputs to regulate muscle mass  <cit> . igf <dig> regulates several signalling pathways including the pi3k/akt/mtor network that controls protein synthesis  <cit> . typically, fibre production continues until 45% of the maximum body length of the fish, and subsequent growth is entirely by fibre elongation and hypertrophy  <cit> . myogenesis involves the activation, proliferation and fusion of a resident myoblast population involving hundreds of structural and regulatory genes  <cit> .

muscle protein degradation occurs through three major pathways  <cit>  namely: membrane-bound lysosomal enzymes, calpain proteases  <cit> , and the ubiquitin proteasome  pathway   <cit> . upp represents the most important system for degradation of unnecessary or damaged proteins. targeted proteins are linked to ubiquitin, which acts as a recognition tag for the proteasome. ubiquitin tagging of proteins requires the coordinated activity of three classes of enzymes known as e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  it is the e <dig> enzymes, also known as e3-ubiquitin ligases, which conjugate ubiquitin to the target protein  <cit> . ubiquitin mediated degradation can be reversed through action of deubiquitinating enzymes , a large group of proteases that cleave ubiquitin-protein conjugates removing the upp signal, and play an essential role in the regulation of protein degradation  <cit> . dubs are subdivided into four families: ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolases , ovarian tumour proteases , jab1/mpn/mov <dig> metalloenzymes and ubiquitin-specific proteases   <cit> . usp is the largest family of dub and regulates a wide variety of cellular processes. although the essential role of usps in protein degradation is well established, less is known about the function and regulation of specific family members: for example usp <dig> has been associated with p <dig> and akt turnover, usp <dig> with receptor tyrosine endocytosis, usp <dig> with the von hippel–lindau disease  pathway and usp <dig> is thought to have a role in muscle development  <cit> . there have been several studies of the expression of protein degradation related genes in fish, mostly in response to varying nutrition and focused on e3-ubiquitin ligases   <cit> . in contrast, nothing is known about the transcriptional regulation of usp family members.

the pacu  is a member of the characiform family  native to the prata basin  and is a target for finfish aquaculture in brazil. one of the main limitations for the development of a selective breeding program for this species is a lack of genetic information as well as limited knowledge about its physiology. next generation sequencing  technologies have dramatically increased the amount of sequence data for teleosts and helped to overcome the lack of annotated genomes   <cit> .

the primary objectives of the present study were 1) to increase the genetic resources available for pacu 2) to exploit the anatomical separation of fibre types to characterise the expression signatures of fast and slow muscles and 3) to systematically investigate the expression of usps in fast and slow muscle in response to fasting and refeeding. teleost fish underwent a teleost-specific genome duplication  event around  <dig> million years ago  which was followed by diploidisation and gene loss  <cit> . it is thought that around  <dig> to 20% of tsgd paralogues have been retained in the diploid genome of extant species  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that paralogues from the tsgd or the salmonid-specific whole-genome duplication , which occurred 88mya  <cit> , can display different patterns of expression during myogenesis and muscle growth  <cit> . a secondary objective was therefore to search for evidence of differential expression between teleost specific paralogues within and between muscle fibre types.

RESULTS
de novo assembly
individual barcoded libraries from fast and slow skeletal muscle tissues were generated from  <dig> adult pacu  and sequenced using hiseq  <dig> platform yielding a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> pair-end reads respectively  .  <dig> , <dig> trimmed paired-end reads  were successfully assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bp and n50 =  <dig>  bp . the present study significantly improves upon previous teleost transcriptomes  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  contigs  were successfully annotated, representing over  <dig>  unique genes with an average coverage of  <dig> and over  <dig>  genes with >90% of the coding sequence  represented . the number of genes found represent between 56-65% of all protein-coding genes currently identified in danio rerio  and astyanax mexicanus  the only two other ostariophysi genomes available  <cit> . pacu contigs were also annotated and classified into  <dig> different vertebrate signalling and metabolic pathways . in some cases, such as for the pi3k/akt/mtor network we found that over 90% of the genes were represented.table  <dig>

the current transcriptome dramatically increases the genetic resources available for the future development of genetic-based breeding programmes in pacu. simple sequence repeats  or microsatellites are widely used for parentage identification and stock management in family selection programs  <cit> . screening for ssrs was focused on those contigs for which over 90% of the cds was present to assure that repeated sequences were correctly identified in the utr regions. a total of  <dig> ssrs were identified in the transcriptome, and the great majority of them  were repeats of a dinucleotide motif  increasing the number of potential microsatellites for this species  <cit> . we also screened the annotated transcriptome to identify tsgd-paralogues. it has been estimated that around  <dig> to 20% of teleost-specific paralogues have been retained in the diploid genomes of extant species  <cit>  with a slightly higher proportion retained in ostariphysi genomes  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> paralogues pairs in the pacu when compare with zebrafish . although this is a significant improvement when compared with previous studies  <cit>  the number of paralogues identified was still lower than what we could expect from a  <dig>  gene transcriptome.table  <dig>

digital gene expression analysis
individual fast and slow muscle libraries were mapped to the complete transcriptome. mapped reads were normalized by contig length, library size and only those with an average of more than  <dig> mapped were used to estimate digital gene expression . whereas there are several transcriptomic studies in teleosts  <cit>  to our knowledge this is the first one to compare global patterns of dge in muscle different fibre types. global dge analysis revealed  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between slow and fast skeletal muscle respectively . gene ontology  enrichment analysis of the differently expressed genes  revealed a significant enrichment in genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism  in slow skeletal muscle and carbohydrate metabolism and kinase activity  in fast skeletal muscle. these results are in agreement with the main differences described between slow and fast muscle with respect to their predominant means of energy supply  <cit> . to further validate go analysis results, reads mapped were individually explored in all components related to general metabolic pathways present in our transcriptome: glycolysis, ß-oxidation, krebs cycle and the electron transport chain . the majority of glycolysis-related enzymes found, such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase , 6-phosphofructokinase  or enolase , were significantly more highly expressed in fast skeletal muscle  . as expected slow muscle had a significantly higher dge in almost all components of the krebs cycle, ß-oxidation pathway and the electron transport chain . therefore dge results captured fundamental physiological and metabolic differences between tissues. we also studied dge in relation to the pi3k/mtor pathway, myogenesis-related genes and tsgd-paralogues between fibre types. previous studies have reported that tsgd-paralogues can display different expression profiles in muscle during myogenesis and in response to varying nutrition, however those studies were always restricted to fast skeletal muscle and to a limited number of paralogues  <cit> . by using dge we found that  <dig> and  <dig> tsgd-paralogues pairs were differentially expressed for slow and fast skeletal muscle respectively . similarly, we found  <dig> paralogues with significant differences in dge between muscle types . various mechanisms have been postulated to explain tsgd paralogue retention during evolution including mutations leading to differential regulation in expression  and/or the evolution of some novel function   <cit> . whilst we cannot distinguish between these possibilities in the present study it is apparent that tsgd paralogue retention has significantly contributed to phenotypic patterning of gene expression between fast and slow muscle fibre types.table  <dig>

the pi3k/akt/mtor network is involved in several cellular processes: muscle growth, cell cycle, muscle differentiation and myoblast proliferation  <cit> . the majority of the pathway’s components were identified in the transcriptome, including several paralogues . we found differences in dge between muscle types for  <dig> components . only  <dig> genes were more abundant in fast skeletal muscle including insulin-like growth factor receptor 1a  and tuberous sclerosis  <dig>  . a total of  <dig> components of the pathway were found to be more highly expressed in slow skeletal muscle including insulin-like growth factor 2b , several insulin-like growth factors binding proteins , protein kinase b gamma , ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase beta 1a , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein  <dig>  and mitogen-activated protein kinases  . those genes significantly up regulated in slow skeletal muscle are directly involved in the stimulation of protein synthesis, suggesting a higher protein synthesis potential in this fibre type  <cit> . some of the genes significantly up regulated in fast skeletal muscle are associated with the regulation of protein synthesis during fasting. for instance, lkb <dig> is expressed when energy levels are low, mlst <dig> binds mtor to stabilize the complex when amino acids are not optimal and tsc <dig> is related with protein synthesis inhibition  <cit> .figure  <dig>

dge was also analysed for the genes associated with myoblast activation, proliferation, differentiation and migration . stac <dig> is a multifunctional signal adaptor protein which shows a strong correlation with myogenin expression both in cell culture and in vivo and is required for normal myotube formation and sarcomere assembly  <cit> . stac <dig> localises to t-tubules and also functions in the mediation of voltage-induced ca2+ release and contractility  <cit> . the higher expression of stac <dig>  in correlation with myogenin, in fast than slow muscle  may therefore reflect the more extensive development of t-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum in this fibre type which are required to achieve shorter contraction cycles during high speed swimming  <cit> . in contrast, the other myogenic regulatory factors  and members of the myocyte enhancer gene family   had similar expression patterns in fast and slow muscles. differences in expression for myostatin paralogues has been previously reported in other fish species including rainbow trout  and tilapia  with mstna expression  confined to brain, testes and spleen and mstnb  more expressed in heart and muscle  <cit> .figure  <dig>

transcriptional regulation of usp and e3-ubiquitin ligases
the quality of the present transcriptome allowed us to study the regulation of the ubiquitin specific proteases  family, a group of dubs for which very little is known in skeletal muscle  <cit> . usps are a highly diverse family with a common ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase  functional domain. several usps members contain a variety of other functional domains including dual specific phosphatases , zinc-finger in ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase , ubiquitin associated domains  or even an hsp <dig> binding motif  . a total of  <dig> usps, representing almost the complete repertoire identified zebrafish, were found in the pacu transcriptome. again, the normalized number of reads mapped was used to estimate their abundance in fast and slow skeletal muscle . we found that  <dig> usps were significantly more abundant in slow   and  <dig> usps were more highly expressed in fast skeletal muscle  . the lack of studies concerning usp function in fish makes it difficult to explain these differences in a physiological context. with the objective of gaining knowledge about the role of usps in muscle growth we performed a nutritional challenge experiment to analyse their expression during the transition from a catabolic to an anabolic state. to this end pacu juveniles were fasted for 4 days followed by a short period of satiation feeding  to stimulate protein synthesis and a subset of muscle expressed usp genes were measured by real-time pcr  . the sub-set was chosen to reflect their diversity with respect to functional domains present . the expression of several pi3k/akt pathway components  and e3-ubiquiting ligases  were also measured to gain a better understanding of the metabolic context in which usp expression was occurring . transcript abundance from the transcriptome was highly correlated with that determined by qpcr .figure  <dig>

the e3-ubiquitin ligases are an essential part of the proteasome system, directly involved in protein degradation  <cit> . all e3-ubiquitin ligases increased their relative abundance during fasting, for example, fbox- <dig> a muscle specific e3-ubiquitin ligase increased 100-fold  and fbox <dig> increased 10-fold, in line with results from other similar studies  <cit> . the majority of the usps increased their expression around 2-fold with fasting and recovered pre-fasting levels 24 h after re-feeding . in contrast, usp12a, showed a transient increase 6 h after re-feeding, and usp <dig> and usp5b did not change in expression . the overlapping expression profiles of usps and e3-ubiquitin ligases suggests that usps play an important role during muscle atrophy. usps can cleave ubiquitin from proteins, effectively removing the proteasome signal  <cit> . it is possible that the increase in their abundance in fasted fish is related to fine tuning of the regulation of protein degradation. for example, many usps targets are essential to maintain cell homeostasis including mdm <dig>  p <dig>  h2a, h2b, fbw <dig>  fancd <dig> or brca <dig>  <cit> , and it is possible that these proteins may be relatively spared during fasting.

CONCLUSIONS
we have produced an in depth transcriptome for fast and slow myotomal muscle for the pacu , an important south american aquaculture species. this resource allowed us to characterise the expression signatures of the main myotomal muscle fibre types and identify candidate microsatellite sequences that could be used in breeding programs. the availability of the transcriptome allowed us to identify and analyse the expression of teleost-specific paralogues retained in the ostariophysi lineage. the transcriptome also enabled a comprehensive study of e <dig> ubiquitin ligase and usp gene expression in the context of the transition between the fasting  and satiation feeding . we identified differences in expression within gene family members thereby identifying candidates for further investigation.
