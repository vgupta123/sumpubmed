BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae, the main pathogen that causes respiratory infections in children younger than five years, can cause various pneumococcal diseases, such as otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, meningitis, pleurisy, and bacteremia. pneumococcal disease has been a major public health problem worldwide. in  <dig>  the world health organization  estimated that  <dig>  million people die of pneumococcal diseases annually, of which the deaths of  <dig>  million to  <dig> million were children younger than five years  <cit> .

antibiotics are often the first treatment of choice for pneumococcal infections. however, the increasing resistance of s. pneumoniae to various antibiotics, including macrolides and tetracyclines, makes pneumococcal infections difficult to treat especially in children and in regions like china. the resistance rate of s. pneumoniae to erythromycin and to tetracycline among children younger than five years in beijing ranged from 87% to 94% and above 80%, respectively  <cit> . pneumococcal macrolide resistance is mediated by two major mechanisms, namely, target modification by a ribosomal methylase encoded by the ermb gene and drug efflux encoded by the mef gene. in s. pneumoniae, the tetracycline resistance is a result of the acquisition of one of the two genes, tetm or teto, both of which encode ribosome protection proteins  <cit> . pneumococcal resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline is frequently associated with the insertion of the ermb gene into the transposons of the tn <dig> or tn <dig> family  that contains the tetm gene.

resistant-clonal isolates are distributed in different countries and regions, which results in the spread of bacterial resistance. the molecular epidemiological monitoring network  has published  <dig> international clones of s. pneumoniae, among which the clones of serotypes 6a, 6b,  <dig>  15a, 19a, 19f, 23f, and 35b were found to be associated with bacterial resistance. thus, a study on the molecular epidemiology of s. pneumoniae for children in one region is beneficial to monitor pneumococal-resistant clones.

studies on the characteristics of erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae in china are rare. thus, the present study focuses on analyzing the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates from pediatric patients in beijing in  <dig> as well as their respective relationships.

methods
bacterial isolates
a total of 140 s. pneumoniae isolates were collected from the nasopharyngeal swabs of pediatric patients younger than five years with upper respiratory infections in the beijing children’s hospital in  <dig> after their parents or legal guardians have given their consent. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the beijing children’s hospital, and all procedures were performed in accordance with the helsinki declaration  <cit> . the isolates were identified based on the typical colony morphology, gram staining, optochin sensitivity test , and omni serum assay . only one isolate was selected from the same subject. of the  <dig> s. pneumoniae isolates,  <dig> were obtained from pediatric patients aged  <dig> to 2 years  and  <dig> from those aged 2 years to 5 years .

antibiotic susceptibility testing
the e-test  method was performed to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of the  <dig> pneumococcal isolates to erythromycin and tetracycline according to the guidelines established by the clinical and laboratory standards institute . the clsi  <dig> criteria  <cit>  for minimum inhibitory concentrations  were applied to classify the susceptible, intermediate, or resistant isolates with the following breakpoints: erythromycin, ≤ <dig>  μg/ml,  <dig>  μg/ml, and ≥1 μg/ml; and tetracycline, ≤2 μg/ml, 4 μg/ml, and ≥8 μg/ml, respectively. atcc <dig> was used as the quality control strain and was included in each set of tests to ensure accurate results.

macrolide resistance phenotype
macrolide resistance phenotyping was performed via double-disk diffusion using standard disks of erythromycin  and clindamycin  . a blunting of the clindamycin inhibition zone adjacent to the erythromycin disk  indicated the presence of the inducible macrolide-resistant phenotype , whereas the absence of blunting indicated the presence of the constitutive macrolide-resistant phenotype . the m macrolide phenotype was characterized by clindamycin susceptibility with no blunting of the inhibition zone around the clindamycin disk.

dna extraction
chromosomal dna was isolated from the overnight cultures of the isolates that were grown on 5% trypticase soy agar by using the dna mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

detection of genes and related transposons
the macrolide-resistance genes ermb and mef were detected using polymerase chain reaction  with oligonucleotide primers specific for each gene as described in the previous studies  <cit> . the pcr products of the mef genes were digested with bamhi to distinguish the mefa and mefe gene subclasses  <cit> .

the tn <dig> and tn <dig> transposon-related genes , the tetracycline-resistance gene tetm, and the promoter of the aph3’-iii gene were detected by pcr using the primers described in previous studies  <cit> . the resistance gene combinations related to the different presumed transposons were tn <dig> , tn <dig> , tn <dig> , tn <dig>  or tn <dig> .

multi locus sequence typing 
the housekeeping genes aroe, gdh, gki, recp, spi, xpt, and ddl were amplified via pcr  <cit> . the sequences of each of the seven loci were compared with those of all known alleles at the loci as well as with the sts in the database of the pneumococcal multi locus sequence typing  website . new allelic numbers or new st numbers were assigned by the curator of the pneumococcal mlst website. the eburst v <dig> software  was used to investigate the relationships between the isolates and to assign a clonal complex  based on the stringent group definition of six out of seven shared alleles.

serotyping
pneumococcal serotyping was performed through the quellung reaction by using pneumotest kits and type-specific antisera  for the erythromycin-resistant isolates as previously described  <cit> . the isolates that reacted negatively were non-typeable. the pcv <dig> and pcv <dig> coverage was estimated by calculating the percentage of isolates that expressed the serotypes included in the vaccine.

statistical analysis
the data from the antibiotic susceptibility testing were set up and analyzed using the whonet  <dig>  software, which was recommended by the who. the χ2-test and the fisher’s accurate probability tests were performed using the spss version  <dig>  software to compare proportions. differences with p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
antibiotic susceptibility
the susceptibility and mics to erythromycin and tetracycline of  <dig> pneumococcal isolates that were collected among children of different ages are presented in table  <dig>  based on the clsi  <dig> criteria, the resistance rate of all isolates to erythromycin was  <dig> % , whereas the susceptibility rate was merely  <dig> % . up to  <dig> %  of the erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates exhibited high mics . the erythromycin resistance rates between children aged  <dig> to 2 years and  <dig> to 5 years were all above  <dig> %, with  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively. no significant difference was found between the two age groups . the total resistance rate of all the isolates to tetracycline reached  <dig> % . no difference was also found in tetracycline resistance between children aged  <dig> to 2 years and  <dig> to 5 years . a total of  <dig>  isolates were resistant to both erythromycin and tetracycline, and  <dig> %  of the erythromycin-resistant strains were non-susceptible  to tetracycline.

detection of resistance genes and phenotype
all  <dig> erythromycin-resistant isolates were detected for macrolide- and tetracycline-resistance genes as well as macrolide-resistant phenotype. almost  <dig> % isolates expressed both the ermb and mef genes, whereas  <dig> % were positive for the ermb gene but negative for the mef gene. the resistant isolates had no different carrying proportions of both the ermb and mef genes, as well as only ermb, between the two aforementioned pediatric age groups  . all mef-positive isolates carried the mefe gene. among the erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates, all the  <dig> tetracycline-resistant and intermediate isolates carried the tetm gene. however, eight of the  <dig> tetracycline-susceptible isolates carried the tetm gene. up to  <dig> %  of the resistant isolates exhibited the cmlsb phenotype, but only two isolates expressed the m phenotype. no imlsb phenotype was found among the resistant isolates.

transposon distribution
among the  <dig> erythromycin-resistant pneumococci,  <dig> isolates  contained ermb, tetm, int, and xis genes related to tn <dig>   <dig> isolates  were detected for the presence of ermb, tetm, int, xis, and mefe genes, carrying the transposon of tn <dig>  seven isolates  were positive for the ermb, tetm, tnpa, and tnpr genes related to tn <dig>  eight isolates  containing the ermb, tetm, int, and xis genes were also positive for the promoter of the aph3’-iii gene related to tn1545/ <dig> via pcr, of which only two isolates had the mefe gene. the int, xis, tnpa, tnpr, aph3’-iii, and mefe genes were not detected in the remaining five isolates  .

multi locus sequence typing
a total of  <dig> sts were found in the erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae, of which  <dig> sts were newly assigned, via mlst analysis. of the new sts,  <dig> types were novel combinations of known alleles . up to  <dig> profiles  contained  <dig> new alleles, namely, aroe <dig>  gdh <dig>  gki <dig>  gki <dig>  gki <dig>  recp <dig>  recp <dig>  spi <dig>  spi <dig>  and ddl <dig>  the four predominant sts of all resistant pneumococci were st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and st <dig>  . of the common sts, the proportion of st <dig> was higher among children aged  <dig> to 2 years than that of the other age group . however, the percentage of the other sts, such as st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  did not show any difference between the two age groups . the eburst analysis results showed  <dig> ccs and  <dig> singletons . cc <dig> was the most frequent cc, with a proportion of  <dig> %  among the resistant isolates.

serotyping and vaccine coverage
among the  <dig> erythromycin-resistant pneumococci,  <dig> isolates  could be serotyped, of which the prevailing five serotypes were 19f , 23f ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 6a , which accounted for  <dig> % . the pneumococcal isolates of serotype 19a were significantly common among children aged  <dig> to 2 years than that of  <dig> to 5 years . however, the pneumococcal isolates of the other serotypes were not different between the two age groups . the pcv <dig> coverage for the erythromycin-resistant isolates was  <dig> % . this value was higher than that of pcv <dig>  among all children younger than five years as well as the children aged  <dig> to 2 years . the pcv <dig> coverage of children aged  <dig> to 5 years was significantly higher than that of  <dig> to 2 years . however, no difference in pcv <dig> coverage was observed among these two age groups  .

relations of sequence types, serotypes, resistance genes, and transposons
several associations were observed between the sts, serotypes, macrolide-resistance genes, as well as tn916- and tn917-related transposons for the erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates . the dominant st of the serotype 19f isolates was st <dig>  followed by st <dig>  on the other hand, that of the serotype  <dig>  23f, and 6b isolates was st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  respectively. the st of all the serotype 19a pneumococci was st <dig>  all isolates of cc <dig>  which was identified as serotype 19f and 19a, carried two macrolide-resistance genes, ermb and mefe. however, the mefe gene was not found among the isolates of other ccs, such as cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  tn <dig> was distributed among the isolates of seven ccs except for cc <dig> and cc <dig>  among which the dominant transposons were tn <dig> and tn <dig>  respectively. tn1545/ <dig> was found in the isolates of st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>

discussion
s. pneumoniae is a gram-positive encapsulated diplococcus and is often transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions from the infected and healthy carriers. the disease develops by contiguous spread to the sinuses or the middle ear, aspiration into the lower respiratory tract, which causes pneumonia, or by invasion into the bloodstream with or without the seeding of secondary sites. according to the  <dig> chinese census data, an estimated  <dig>   pneumonia and  <dig>  meningitis cases were caused by s. pneumoniae. the estimated deaths from s. pneumoniae pneumonia and meningitis were  <dig>   and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . this result indicates that pneumococcal diseases are a significant health problem among children in china.

pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobials, such as macrolides and tetracyclines, is a serious and rapidly growing problem worldwide. in the asian network for surveillance of resistant pathogen study, song et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that asian regions had the highest levels of s. pneumoniae antibiotic resistance. a total of  <dig> % of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were observed in asian countries. vietnam had the highest resistance rate, followed by taiwan, korea, hong kong, and the hinterlands of china  <cit> . the erythromycin resistance rate of s. pneumoniae in  <dig> to  <dig> in beijing was  <dig> %  <cit> , which was much higher than that in  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . pneumococci data of hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory infections showed  <dig> % erythromycin resistance in shanghai  <cit>  and  <dig> % in chongqing  <cit> . in the present study, the erythromycin resistance rate of s. pneumoniae was higher at  <dig> %, and most of the isolates had high mics , which indicated an increasing trend of pneumococcal erythromycin resistance in the hinterlands of china. geographical variations were observed in the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae. the ermb gene was the most common mechanism for erythromycin resistance in the hinterlands of china, taiwan, sri lanka, and korea, similar to the results of this study for the children in beijing. however, the mef gene was more common in hong kong, singapore, thailand, and malaysia  <cit> . in europe, the ermb gene was the dominant macrolide-resistance gene, especially in france, spain, switzerland, and poland. on the other hand, the mef gene was common in greece and germany  <cit> . in the present study, the mlsb phenotype was the predominant phenotype among the erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates, which was in accordance with previous studies in china  <cit> . however, the m phenotype was more prevalent than the mlsb phenotype in other countries, such as in canada and in the united kingdom  <cit> .

the resistance of s. pneumoniae to tetracycline was also significantly high in china, which was similar to that of erythromycin. this result may be related to the abuse of tetracycline in agriculture and edible animals. a multi-center research on the antibiotic resistance of s. pneumoniae involving four cities in china revealed that  <dig> % of pneumococcal isolates were tetracycline-resistant among 1-month-old to 5-year-old children with acute upper respiratory infections  <cit> . the tetracycline non-susceptible rate among the invasive erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates collected in australia was  <dig> %  <cit> . this value was lower than the non-invasive erythromycin-resistant isolates in the current study. the present study, in addition to previous ones  <cit> , proved that the tetm gene was responsible for tetracycline resistance in s. pneumoniae. in the present study, we found that the eight pneumococcal isolates with the tetm gene were susceptible to tetracycline. amezaga et al.  <cit>  identified a 10 bp deletion in the sequence of the tetm gene of one tetracycline-susceptible isolate. this result was relative to the tetm sequence in tetracycline-resistant isolates. thus, further studies are necessary.

tetracycline resistance is associated with erythromycin resistance in pneumococcal isolates, which are transmitted by the transposons of the tn <dig> or tn <dig> family including tn <dig>  tn <dig>  tn <dig>  tn <dig>  and tn <dig>  tn <dig>  which was first detected in streptococcus cristatus, originated from the insertion of an ermb-containing dna fragment into tn <dig>  which carries the tetm gene  <cit> . our study showed that tn <dig> was more common among erythromycin-resistant isolates in beijing children, which accounts for  <dig> %. in addition, tn <dig> is a composite element of adding the mefe gene on the basis of tn <dig>  with a proportion of  <dig> % in the present study. tn <dig> results from the insertion of the ermb-containing tn <dig> transposon  <cit>  into tn <dig> <cit> . tn <dig> and tn <dig> have similar compositions; they both contain the kanamycin resistance gene aph3’-iii aside from the erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistance determinants ermb and tetm. in this study, the transposons tn <dig> and tn1545/tn <dig> were rare at approximately  <dig> %, indicating that tn <dig> and tn1545/tn <dig> were not the main factors for erythromycin and tetracycline resistance in beijing children. moreover, we also found five pneumococcal isolates without transposon determinants that carried the ermb and tetm genes or only ermb gene. further studies are necessary to verify if these five isolates contain unknown transposons.

three conjugate vaccines, namely, pcv <dig>  pcv <dig>  and pcv <dig>  were introduced to prevent pneumococcal infections in children. pcv <dig> included serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  6a, 7f, and 19a plus the pcv <dig> serotypes  <dig>  6b, 9v,  <dig>  18c, 19f, and 23f. in this study, the serotypes 23f, 19f,  <dig>  and 6b were common among s. pneumoniae from beijing children younger than five years. this result was similar with the previous studies in china  <cit> , but different from that of the other european countries, in which the serotypes  <dig>   <dig>  6a, 7f, and 19a were common among pneumococcal isolates  <cit> . since the introduction of pcv <dig>  the incidence of pneumococcal disease because of pcv7-serotypes has significantly declined in many countries. however, several countries have reported an increased rate of pneumococcal disease in non-pcv <dig> serotypes. this phenomenon, termed ‘replacement’, is associated with specific pneumococcal serotypes or clones  <cit> . in china, the pcv7-serotypes were more popular among children for two reasons: first, pcv <dig> has been on the market for only four years in china since  <dig>  second, only about 1% of chinese children use pcv <dig> for their routine pneumococcal immunization. we found that the pcv <dig> coverage of the erythromycin-resistant isolates was higher than that of pcv <dig> among all children younger than five years as well as the children aged  <dig> to 2 years because of the high rates of serotypes  <dig>  6a, and 19a. moreover, the pcv <dig> coverage of children aged  <dig> to 5 years was also significant higher than that of children aged  <dig> to 2 years. all these results indicate that pcv <dig> controls the pneumococcal diseases caused by the erythromycin-resistant isolates better than pcv <dig> for children, especially those younger than two years.

maiden et al.  <cit>  introduced the mlst approach to monitor the epidemiology of bacteria based on multi locus enzyme electrophoresis. enright and spratt were the first to apply mlst for pneumococcal studies  <cit> . the mlst database enables the global sharing of data and helps in the exchange of data between different laboratories. thus, it can be used to monitor the molecular epidemiology of s. pneumoniae worldwide. in the present study, the prevalent sts were st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  in shanghai, st <dig> and st <dig> were the most common sts for s. pneumoniae <cit> . st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> were the prevalent types among the invasive pneumococcal isolates collected from  <dig> cities in china  <cit> . in norway, the frequent sts were st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> among the isolates collected from the children attending daycare centers  <cit> . several associations were found between sts, serotypes, and macrolide-resistance genes in this study. the dominant sts of the serotype 19f,  <dig>  23f, and 6b isolates were st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  respectively. st <dig> was more common in children aged  <dig> to 2 years than in other age groups and all were from the serotype 19a pneumococci. notably, st <dig> was found to be the predominant type among pneumococcal serotype 19a isolates from ten asian countries  <cit> . this suggests that st <dig> has an important function in pneumococcal diseases in children. the st <dig> clone of serotype 19a is expected to be more prevalent worldwide because of the wide use of pcv <dig>  a systematic study showed that taiwan19f- <dig> was one of the two dominant clones for erythromycin-resistant isolates in asian regions  <cit> . taiwan19f- <dig> , a multidrug-resistant pneumococcal molecular epidemiology network clone and one of the most main clones causing invasive pneumococcal diseases in asian countries  <cit> , was associated with seven sts in this study, st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  st <dig> is a single locus variant of st <dig> and a double locus variant of st <dig>  according to eburst analysis, both st <dig> and st <dig> belong to cc <dig>  which was the most common cc observed in this study. cc <dig> emerged in the united states after the introduction of pcv <dig>  and expressed both the ermb and mef genes  <cit> , as shown in the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
s. pneumoniae in children younger than five years in beijing presented high and significant resistance rates to erythromycin and tetracycline. the ermb and tetm genes were the main factors for pneumococcal erythromycin and tetracycline resistance, respectively. majority of the erythromycin-resistant isolates exhibited the cmlsb phenotype and carries the ermb, tetm, xis, and int genes, which suggested the spread of the transposons of the tn <dig> family. pcv <dig> provided higher serotype coverage in the childhood pneumococcal diseases caused by the erythromycin-resistant isolates better than pcv <dig>  the incidence of erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae among children is continuously increasing; thus, further long-term studies of their molecular characteristics are necessary.
