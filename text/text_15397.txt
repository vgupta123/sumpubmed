BACKGROUND
the anamorphic fungus beauveria bassiana  vuill.  is the most widely used mycopesticide for the biological control of insect pests  <cit> , formulations based on this fungus being available for commercial use  <cit> . however, there are still many unresolved questions in our understanding of the life of fungal entomopathogens, including their population characteristics and relationships between genotypes and habitats or host-pathogen interactions  <cit> . for predictable and successful application of biological control agents  to control diseases and pests in natural environments, their biology and ecology must be well understood  <cit> .

the morphological features of conidia are common tools for identification in beauveria. morphological and molecular studies have shown that the broad patterns of diversity in beauveria have been accurately predicted in previous morphological studies. however, they have also shown that these approaches are insufficient to investigate species such as b. bassiana  <cit> . molecular data applied to taxonomic investigations have demonstrated that b. bassiana is a species complex with several cryptic species and have corroborated their link to cordyceps teleomorphs  <cit> . in this sense, phylogenetic studies based on nuclear its and elongation factor 1-alpha  sequences have demonstrated the monophyly of beauveria and the existence of at least two lineages within b. bassiana s.l. , and also that ef1-α sequences provide adequate information for the inference of relationships in this genus  <cit> . studies on the genetic variability of bcas such as b. bassiana are crucial for the development of molecular tools for their monitoring in the natural environment  <cit> .

minisatellite loci  <cit> , random amplified polymorphism dna   <cit> , universally primed  pcr  <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , isoenzyme analyses  <cit> , or combinations of these methods  <cit>  have provided useful polymorphisms to access genetic diversity among b. bassiana isolates.

although some molecular studies have correlated b. bassiana genetic groups and host affiliation  <cit> , more recent evidence indicates that this is not the case since b. bassiana contains generalist enthomopathogens with no particular phylogenetic association with their insect host  <cit> , environmental factors being the prime selective forces for genotypic evolution in b. bassiana  <cit> . in this sense, several studies have demonstrated the association between b. bassiana genetic groups and canadian  <cit> , brazilian  <cit>  and world-wide  <cit>  climatic zones.

entomopathogenic species displayed a high degree of variability-mainly attributed to the presence of group i introns- at specific sites of the coding regions of small and large subunits of nuclear ribosomal rna genes . group i introns in entomopathogenic fungi were initially reported in beauveria brongniartii lsu genes  <cit> . work addressing the presence and usefulness of these non-coding elements has been reported for beauveria. for example, neuvéglise et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> form variants of introns, differing in size and restriction patterns, at four different lsu positions from among a panel of  <dig> isolates of b. brongniartii, two of b. bassiana, and one of metarhizium anisopliae from several geographic origins. coates et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> intron forms in the ssu from  <dig> beauveria isolates. wang et al.  <cit>  analyzed the presence of group i introns in the four lsu insertion positions, designated bb <dig> , bb <dig> , bb <dig>  and bb <dig> , and distributed a collection of  <dig> b. bassiana isolates in  <dig> different genotypes. in that study, their sequence analyses confirmed that the introns were invariably inserted in specific target sequences, and a strong correlation between specific insertion sites and intron subgroups was also observed. in addition, the features and behaviour of these group i intron were also detected in related genera such as cordyceps  <cit>  and metarhizium  <cit> .

the present study was undertaken to investigate the genetic variability existing in a collection of  <dig> spanish isolates of b. bassiana, obtained from different substrates or insect hosts, and  <dig> isolates from other european countries. the insertion patterns of group i introns at the 3'-end of the lsu rdna genes and ef1-α phylogenetic distribution were integrated in order to explore any possible correlation between genetic groups and geographical/climate origin, and habitat or insect host.

RESULTS
analysis of group i introns in 3' lsu rdna
the 3'-end of the nuclear lsu rdna genes of the  <dig> b. bassiana isolates  was amplified with primers i <dig> and m <dig> and four different sizes of pcr products were observed on agarose gels, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. the sizes were as follows: about  <dig> bp for  <dig> isolates;  <dig> bp for one isolate;  <dig> bp for  <dig> isolates, and  <dig> bp for  <dig> isolates. all amplicons were purified and sequenced in order to determine whether the insertion of multiple sequences, a feature described for members of this and other entomopathogenic genera, was responsible for the diversity of their lengths.

after sequencing analysis , we observed that the smallest pcr products were detected in  <dig> out of the  <dig> isolates studied-coded bb <dig>  bb <dig> and bb57- indicating that these isolates had no introns, and the intronless sequence size was  <dig> bp; identical in composition to a homologous fragment of b. bassiana s.l.  <cit>  described previously. the other  <dig> isolates exhibited introns inserted at one or more of the four possible conserved positions. among these  <dig> intron-containing isolates, the insertion was as follows:  <dig> showed inserted sequences at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> ; one isolate, bb <dig>  with a sequence size of  <dig> bp, contained two introns at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , and nine isolates contained only one intron at position  <dig>

** sequence types inserted at position  <dig>  are indicated by their sizes in bp, followed by a letter for identical sizes  to indicate small differences in their composition.

the presence/absence of introns at the 3'-end of the nuclear lsu rdna of the  <dig> isolates analyzed allowed their distribution in the following genotypes: a1b2b3a <dig>  b1a2b3a <dig>  b1b2b3a <dig> and b1b2b3b <dig> . insertion sites are numbered from  <dig> to  <dig>  also following wang's terminology  <cit> : ec <dig> , ec <dig> , ec <dig>  and ec <dig> . these genotypes and their distribution frequencies are shown in table  <dig>  three out of the  <dig> isolates had no introns; nine contained one, and forty-five had two introns. fifty-four of  <dig> isolates showed an inserted intron at position  <dig>  and  <dig> isolates at position  <dig>  whereas only one isolate had an inserted intron at position  <dig>  none of the  <dig> isolates had introns at the  <dig> insertion site.

there was a significant correlation between belonging to an intron genotype and the mean of the optimal  and highest  growth temperatures, which were significantly lower in the genotype b1b2b3a <dig>  with topt and tmax values of  <dig>  and  <dig> °c, respectively, than those obtained for a1b2b3a <dig>  with topt of  <dig>  and tmax  <dig> °c .

two different intron sequence sizes,  <dig> or  <dig> bp in length, were detected at position  <dig> within the  <dig> beauveria isolates that bore an insertion at this site, allowing the distribution of the isolates into two sub-genotypes . three of these  <dig> isolates had a sequence of  <dig> bp, showing 100% identity with the 4-position intron sequence reported for b. bassiana bb <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig> of the b. bassiana isolates, the inserted sequence length at this position was  <dig> bp, and four variants with few nucleotide differences were observed after alignment of these sequences, showing identity values of  <dig> to 100% with another sequence detected at the same position in b. bassiana bb <dig>  <cit> .

the intron sequence inserted at position  <dig> was only detected for bb <dig>  an isolate obtained in santander , and was  <dig> bp long. this intron shared  <dig> and 98% identity with two sequences previously detected at the same position in the lsu of b. bassiana isolates  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . a 387-bp intron was identified in  <dig> isolates at position  <dig>  alignment of these sequences revealed that the 387-bp sequence was conserved in the  <dig> b. bassiana isolates, where this intron was observed, and this sequence had identity values of 98% with the previously described sequence of b. bassiana ecbl <dig>  <cit> .

the seven different b. bassiana intron sequences exhibited the typical characteristics of group i and no orfs were detected. these intron sequences from b. bassiana were compared with other fungal intron sequences available in databases for their placement in previously reported subgroups  <cit> . the introns inserted at positions  <dig> and  <dig> were placed in the ic <dig> subgroup , and that inserted at position  <dig> was placed in the ie subgroup. as previously observed in group i introns  <cit> , those inserted at the same site all belonged to the same subgroup. the intron sequences obtained in this work were compared with other b. bassiana intron sequences representing different subgroups to examine their polymorphisms . intron size and nucleotide identity differences were observed but p, q, r and s motif elements, which are needed for the formation of the secondary structure of group i introns  <cit> , were highly conserved among the introns inserted at the same site, particularly for position  <dig>  the highest polymorphism was observed in introns inserted at  <dig>  the p1-p <dig> helices being the source of this variation, and at  <dig>  in the p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> helices.

the mp tree obtained after an alignment of the  <dig> different intron sequence types identified from  <dig> b. bassiana isolates and another  <dig> genbank-deposited sequences, which represent intron sequences from m. anisopliae, b. bassiana and cordyceps profilica, together with the subsequent phylogenetic analysis are shown in figure  <dig>  the tree reveals the separation of four independent groups, supported by high bootstrap values, corresponding to the four positions reported previously  <cit> : ec <dig> , ec <dig> , ec <dig>  and ec <dig> , where intron insertions occurred. the tree shows that the sequence group located at position  <dig> is closer to those at position  <dig> and both contain ic <dig> subgroup introns. similarly, position  <dig> sequences are closer to position  <dig> sequences, and both groups have ie subgroup introns. within position  <dig>  cordyceps and metarhizium were separated from beauveria sequences and formed an independent group, supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. in addition, the five different beauveria sequences obtained here were separated into two of the four observed groups at this position, supported by bootstrap values of 94% and 60%. this separation was in accordance with the two sequence sizes detected:  <dig> and 427-bp in length. however, the four different sequence types detected for 443-bp-sized introns were not separated after phylogenetic analysis.

ef1-α gene analysis
with the exception of isolate bb <dig>  where no amplification was observed, all isolates afforded pcr products of  <dig>  kb for the ef1-α gene with the primers tef1fw and 1750-r. eleven different ef1-α gene sequences were identified among the  <dig> isolates. the alignment and comparison of these  <dig> sequences and another  <dig> genbank-deposited sequences, representing different lineages from b. bassiana s.s. , b. brongniartii and b. bassiana clade c  <cit> , produced  <dig> aligned positions, with  <dig> constant characters and  <dig> parsimony-informative characters. the mp tree is shown in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates analyzed,  <dig> %  were located in the b. bassiana s.s. clade, and  <dig> %  in clade c, which includes b. cf.  bassiana isolates. within b. bassiana s.s., the  <dig> isolates analyzed in this study were separated in five subgroups , supported by bootstrap values higher than 50%.

integration of intron insertion patterns and ef1-α phylogenetic distribution
in order to assess the phylogenic distribution of the different intron configuration types, they were mapped on the ef1-α tree . all  <dig> b. bassiana s.s. isolates showed an intron ic <dig> inserted at position  <dig>  however, the ie intron inserted at position  <dig> was only present in the  <dig> isolates from subgroup eu- <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates from subgroup wd- <dig>  in particular, this subgroup included most of the spanish isolates of b. bassiana forming an ef1-α phylogenetic group with isolates  <dig> from romania and  <dig> from the usa  <cit>  but displaying two different intron insertion models. bb <dig> showed a unique intron insertion pattern, with an ic <dig> intron at position  <dig>  and located separately in the eu- <dig> subgroup. no introns were detected at any position in the three b. cf. bassiana isolates from clade c.

no correlation between ef1-α phylogenetic groups and insect host was observed. although eu- <dig> subgroup did not included isolates of insect origin, the wd- <dig> subgroup grouped isolates collected from diptera, hymenoptera, lepidoptera and orthoptera. moreover, wd- <dig> isolates from orthoptera displayed different intron insertion models .

forty-nine spanish and one portuguese isolates of b. bassiana s.s. were collected from subtropical mediterranean climate zones and were distributed in the eu- <dig>  eu- <dig>  wd- <dig> and eu- <dig> subgroups. two spanish isolates, bb <dig> and bb <dig>  were collected from continental climate locations and were placed within subgroups eu- <dig> and wd- <dig>  respectively. the only b. bassiana s.s. isolate from a humid oceanic climate included in this work, bb <dig> from santander, displayed a characteristic intron insertion model and formed the ef1-α subgroup eu- <dig>  in addition, bb <dig> produced smaller conidia than the rest of b. bassiana isolates, this morphological feature being statistically significant . nevertheless, other isolate from the same climatic zone, bb <dig>  was grouped with other european isolates in b. cf. bassiana clade c.

discussion
in the present study, we have identified different b. bassiana genotypes and phylogenetic subgroups in a collection of  <dig> isolates of this fungus, based on intron insertion patterns and ef1-α phylogenies, respectively.

the variability in group i introns from rdna genes has been used as a molecular tool for the identification of polymorphisms in entomopathogenic fungi  <cit> . our study of b. bassiana lsu rdna identified  <dig> introns among the  <dig> isolates analyzed. four specific sites of intron insertion have been described previously in beauveria species  <cit> , but in our collection introns were only detected at positions  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> 

particularly, our study shows that 100% of b. bassiana s.s. isolates had an intron inserted at position  <dig>  this position was also preferential for intron insertion  in a population of  <dig> b. bassiana isolates  <cit> . the number of introns found in the  <dig> isolates was in agreement with the  <dig> introns detected in  <dig> b. bassiana isolates by wang et al.  <cit> ; the  <dig> introns detected in  <dig> m. anisopliae isolates by márquez et al.  <cit> , and the  <dig> introns found in  <dig> representative members of the genus cordyceps by nikoh and fukatsu  <cit> . however, only four intron insertion patterns were present in our b. bassiana collection while greater variability was found in other studies:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> insertion patterns within  <dig> b. bassiana  <cit> ,  <dig> m. anisopliae  <cit>  and  <dig> b. brongniartii  <cit>  isolates, respectively.

the mp tree based on intron sequences shows that they were distributed in four large groups, with bootstrap values of 100%, corresponding to four insertion positions . as could be expected  <cit> , the introns inserted at the same site always belonged to the same subgroup: ic <dig> at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and ie at position  <dig>  although the origin and transmission mechanisms of group i introns have generated controversy  <cit> , this distribution of sequences is in agreement with previously reported observations  <cit>  and means that introns inserted at the same position have a monophyletic origin and are transmitted vertically. in subsequent events intron speciation and diversification take place as occurs at position  <dig>  where b. bassiana introns are separated from metarhizium and cordyceps introns, and two b. bassiana ic <dig> sequence sizes were located in two different sub-clades, supported by high bootstrap values.

rehner and buckley's study  <cit>  based on ef1-α and its phylogenies has revealed that i) six clades can be resolved within beauveria  and, excepting those corresponding to b. bassiana , they are closely to species previously described on the basis of their morphology, and ii) b. bassiana s.s.  was determined almost entirely from nucleotide variation at ef1-α. further phylogenetic studies carried out with nuclear and/or mitochondrial dna regions of b. bassiana from all continents have served to resolve lineage diversity within this species  <cit> . since phylogenetic species by continent and in the order of their discovery have been designated previously  <cit> , we followed this nomenclature to refer the new phylogenetic subgroups identified among the spanish b. bassiana s.s. isolates as eu- <dig>  eu- <dig> and eu- <dig>  the results obtained from mp analyses , using a  <dig>  kb fragment of the ef1-α gene from  <dig> isolates from our collection, confirmed that  <dig> isolates were b. bassiana s.s. , and three isolates grouped in three different phylogenetic subgroups within b. cf. bassiana . as in a previous study  <cit> , the collection of spanish isolates of b. bassiana s.s. was separated in five phylogenetic subgroups. however, only isolate bb <dig>  sampled from insects, was grouped with one  of the five phylogenetic species proposed by those authors working with a danish collection of b. bassiana s.s.  <cit> , including insect isolates only. interestingly, three phylogenetic subgroups  were only formed by isolates from spanish and portuguese isolates. however, most of the isolates in our collection  were grouped with isolates from romania and the usa in the world-wide phylogenetic subgroup wd- <dig>  which includes isolates from europe, africa and north america  <cit> .

when the different intron insertion patterns were mapped on the b. bassiana ef1-α phylogeny , the existence of a same intron genotype in a given phylogenetic subgroup could be indicative of its clonal origin as it is the case of eu- <dig> and eu- <dig>  previous studies have shown that eu- <dig>  where bb <dig> is located, is a clonal group  <cit> . isolate bb <dig> was the only member of eu- <dig> and the separated phylogenetic grouping of this isolate is supported by a characteristic intron insertion pattern and the production of statistically significant smaller conidia than those from any other intron genotype . the two different intron genotypes observed among the isolates from the complex phylogenetic subgroup wd- <dig>  may indicate that homologous recombination is involved in the ie intron loss at position  <dig>  previous studies have shown frequent intron losses of group i introns in the nuclear rdnas of cordyceps  <cit> . recently, a low frequency of sexual reproduction was observed in eu- <dig>  <cit> ; this could also be the case of wd- <dig> where the absence of an ie intron at position  <dig> was only observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates of this phylogenetic subgroup.

the genetic diversity of spanish b. bassiana s.s. isolates was compared in relation to their hosts and geographical provenance and according to the latter view  <cit> , no general correlation can be observed between the molecular variability among isolates and host and/or geographical origin. although most of the isolates in our study were collected from soil,  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates from insects were grouped together in the subgroup wd- <dig> although they derived from different insect orders. phylogenetic subgroups only indicated a tenuous dependence upon geographic origin . a recent phylogeographic report  <cit>  has provided evidence that the genetic distance of brazilian b. bassiana isolates correlates with geographical distance, suggesting that according to rehner's study  <cit>  allopatry plays an important role in the phylogenetic diversification of b. bassiana. the authors of another recent study  <cit>  concluded that multiple phylogenetic species of b. bassiana s.s. co-exist in sympatry within the limited natural habitat of a bordering hedgerow. we observed that isolates sampled in close locations were placed in different phylogenetic subgroups . according to meyling's study  <cit> , the high phylogenetic diversity of the spanish isolates of b. bassiana s.s. could be explained by the untilled habitats where most of them were sampled .

previous studies have suggested that the saprophytic phase of entomopathogenic fungi exerts evolutionary pressure on the genotype and that adaptation to a habitat type is associated with their environmental preferences  <cit> . recent studies have also pointed out the importance of climatic conditions in the prevalence and distribution of b. bassiana genotypes  <cit> . our study was carried out on  <dig> isolates from subtropical mediterranean climate locations that were distributed within the phylogenetic subgroups eu- <dig>  eu- <dig>  eu- <dig>  wd- <dig> and clade c;  <dig> isolates were from continental climate sites and grouped in eu- <dig>  wd- <dig> and clade c; and  <dig> isolates came from a humid oceanic climate zone, being located in eu- <dig> and clade c. interestingly, the only b. bassiana s.s. from a humid oceanic climate was the singular isolate bb <dig>  the fact that isolates from mediterranean or continental climates overlapped in different phylogenetic subgroups, could be due to lower differences among the abiotic conditions existing in spain, a country covering far smaller geographical surface and with much less variability than that considered in other canadian, brazilian or world-wide studies where phylogenetic species showed a better correlation with climate characteristics  <cit> , biogeographic distribution  <cit>  and habitat  <cit> . in a thermal growth study  <cit>  it was described that b. bassiana genetic groups from three different habitats in canada were associated with temperature preferences. when we explored the thermal preferences within a set of spanish b. bassiana s.s. isolates belonging to the two main intron genotypes  and four phylogenetic ef1-α subgroups , a correlation between intron genotypes and the mean optimal and maximum temperatures for growth was observed, both growth temperatures being significantly lower in the b1b2b3a <dig> genotype with respect to a1b2b3a <dig>  however, no correlation was observed between thermal preferences and the climatic origin of the spanish b. bassiana isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
four intron genotypes, and five and three phylogenetic subgroups within b. bassiana s.s. and b. cf. bassiana  have been identified, respectively, in a collection of  <dig> b. bassiana isolates - <dig> from spain. the highest polymorphism was observed in introns inserted at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  all b. bassiana s.s. displayed an ic <dig> intron inserted at position  <dig>  integration of intron insertion patterns and ef1-α phylogenetic distribution served to demonstrate the monophyletic origin and vertical transmission of introns inserted at the same site. in subsequent events intron speciation and diversification take place as occurs at site  <dig>  where b. bassiana introns are separated from metarhizium and cordyceps introns. no general correlation was observed between the molecular data and insect host, but a tenuous correlation was detected with the geographic origins. the high phylogenetic diversity of the spanish isolates of b. bassiana s.s. could be due to the untilled habitats where most of them were sampled.
