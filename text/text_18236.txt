BACKGROUND
the ability to mount specific immune responses depends on a highly diverse repertoire of t- and b-cell antigen-receptor molecules. the genetic diversity required for millions of distinct antigen-receptors is created by the somatic recombination and fusion of individual variable , diversity , and joining  gene segments in a process known as vj recombination. during vj recombination, genomic dna is cleaved at the boundaries of individual v, d, and j gene segments and the intervening dna removed or inverted; subsequently, the newly apposed gene segments are ligated to form the variable region exon of one of the four types of antigen-receptor genes . these recombination events are mediated by rag- <dig> and rag- <dig> in the form of a vj recombinase holoenzyme that is directed to proper sites of cleavage by dna motifs known as recombination signals . rs are located at the boundaries of v, d, and j gene segments and defined by highly conserved heptamer- and less-well conserved nonamer sequences that are separated by non-conserved spacer regions 12- or 23-base pairs  in length  <cit> . under physiologic conditions, vj recombination follows the "12/ <dig> rule" to assemble functional antigen-receptor genes, i.e., cleavage and recombination occur only between rs with dissimilar spacer types.

rs-like sequences that are unassociated with v, d, or j gene segments have been identified in the genomes of mice and humans  <cit> . a subset of these cryptic rs  are located within the igh and igκ loci  <cit> . crs in the igh locus are embedded at the 3' end of vh gene segments where they mediate vh → vhdjh replacement reactions  <cit> . crs in the igκ locus are located within introns where they mediate inactivation of igκ alleles  <cit> . with the exception of  <cit> , previous studies of v-embedded crs have focused on the igh locus. vh gene replacement mediated by v-embedded crs can rescue the development of b cells bearing autoreactive receptors and has been described as a mechanism for the maintenance of self-tolerance  <cit> . in fact, it has been argued that vh crs are conserved specifically to provide a mechanism for secondary rearrangements at the igh locus, as "secondary vh to jh  cannot work because vh and jh  do not meet the  <cit>  requirement for recombination and because d segments, the guardians of this rule, are deleted by the primary vj recombination"  <cit> .

previously, we conducted a global analysis of crs across mouse vh gene segments using a computational algorithm to predict the location and functional activity of vh crs; these predictions were then tested using a ligation-mediated pcr  to detect vh crs cleavage in purified populations of mouse b-lineage cells recovered from murine bone marrow  <cit> . we discovered that not only are crs conserved at sites distributed throughout vh gene segments but also that vh crs are cleaved only during the pro-b cell stage of development  <cit> . both results are inconsistent with the paradigmatic view that functional vh crs are maintained to facilitate the rescue of autoreactive b cells that would otherwise be lost to the mechanisms of self tolerance  <cit> . our results suggested to us that vh crs may be conserved for other reasons  <cit> .

in contrast to receptor editing via vh replacement, receptor editing at the igκ locus, takes the form of either secondary, de novo vκ → jκ rearrangements that replace or invert primary vκjκ joins  <cit> , or more rarely, inactivating rearrangement with crs that flank the cκ exon  <cit> . secondary, de novo rearrangements are not only possible at the igκ locus, but highly efficient because of the locus' organization: vκ gene segments are associated with 12-rs while jκ gene segments are associated with 23-rs, removing the need for a d gene segment and allowing repeated, direct vκjκ rearrangements; vκ genes are present in both orientations, resulting in many inversion rearrangements and conserving vκ gene segments that lie between the rearranging vκ and jκ gene segments for subsequent rearrangements; the possibility for rearrangement at the igλ locus further increases the opportunity for editing.

a corollary of the argument that vh crs are conserved to provide a mechanism for secondary rearrangement at the igh locus  <cit>  is that crs would not be conserved within vκ gene segments. thus far, however, there have been no systematic attempts to search for crs within vκ gene segments, to determine the extent of vκ crs conservation, or to determine whether they are functional. previous work searched vκ sequence alignments for partial heptamer motifs  at a location within vκ orthologous to the location of the 3' vh crs  <cit> . it was noted that 10% of the vκ gene segments examined contain this partial heptamer motif  <cit> . we extend this study using a computational algorithm that allows for systematic scanning of the full length of vκ gene segments for complete crs  <cit>  and by showing that conserved vκ crs are cleaved.

to test the hypothesis that functional crs are not conserved in vκ gene segments, we conducted a global examination of mouse vκ segments using the computational and experimental methods of our earlier study of vh crs  <cit> . as in our study of vh crs, we find that vκ crs are present and cleaved at multiple, conserved locations in vκ gene segments. these crs are conserved across vκ gene families and are cleaved during the small pre-b cell stage of b-cell development. this study is the first to show that crs are conserved within vκ gene segments, and that these crs are cleaved in vivo. our findings support the hypothesis  <cit>  that crs are conserved in ig v gene segments for a purpose unassociated with the maintenance of self-tolerance.

RESULTS
identification of crs embedded in vκ gene segments
to identify crs in vκ gene segments, we applied a statistical model of mouse rs to the  <dig> mouse vκ gene segments and alleles listed in the immunogenetics information system  reference directory set  <cit> . we previously used this analytic method to identify crs in mouse vh gene segments and in a 212-kb control region of mouse chromosome  <dig>  not subject to physiologic vj recombination  <cit> . our statistical model assigns a recombination information content  score to any rs-length dna sequence beginning with the nucleotides ca; such sequences are referred to as potential crs. dna sequences of length 28-bp are assigned ric scores based on the ric <dig> model for rs with 12-bp spacers, while 39-bp sequences are assigned ric scores based on the ric <dig> model. higher ric scores indicate higher sequence similarities to mouse rs and are predictive of higher recombination efficiencies  <cit> .

we have previously determined a threshold for 28-bp crs of ric <dig> ≥ - <dig> using the ric score of the functional crs embedded in the 3h <dig> vh transgene  <cit> . 39-bp rs have a lower ric score than 28-bp rs , thus we set a correspondingly lower threshold for the detection of 39-bp crs of ric <dig> ≥ - <dig>  <cit> .

we scanned for potential crs on both dna strands of each vκ gene segment. potential crs found on the sense strand, and thus in the orientation of physiologic rs, are referred to as being in orientation  <dig> . potential crs found on the antisense strand, and thus opposite in orientation to physiologic rs, are defined to be in orientation  <dig> . both strands of sequence ac <dig> were also scanned. crs in the strand listed in ncbi were arbitrarily assigned the o <dig> orientation, and crs in the inverse complement sequence assigned to the o <dig> orientation.

the analyzed vκ gene segments contained  <dig> potential crs with 12-bp spacers   and  <dig> potential 23-crs  . of the potential 12-crs identified,  <dig>  and  <dig>  had a ric <dig> > - <dig>  while  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the potential 23-crs had a ric <dig> >- <dig> .

ric <dig> and ric23were computed for all 28-bp and 39-bp sequences beginning with a ca-dinucleotide in both o <dig> and o <dig> in vh and vκ gene segments, and in a 212-kb portion of chromosome  <dig> . the number of sequences with ric above - <dig> and above - <dig> are shown with the relative frequencies shown in parentheses.

vκ crs are conserved in o2
we compared the relative frequencies of 12- and 23-crs in vκ gene segments with those present in control sequence ac <dig>  <cit>  and found that the relative frequencies of 12- and 23- vκ crs in the o <dig> orientation are significantly higher than in the ac <dig> control . in contrast, the frequencies of vκ crs in o <dig> do not differ from those in ac <dig>  . these biases for crs in vκ gene segments are unlike those of vh crs, which contain significantly more o <dig> and o <dig> 12-crs and significantly fewer o <dig> and o <dig> 23-crs than ac <dig>  <cit> .

to examine further the differences between vκ and vh crs, we compared the distributions and orientations of vκ crs with those of the crs present in vh gene segments  <cit> . vκ gene segments exhibit significantly higher relative frequencies of 23-crs in either o <dig> or o <dig> than do vh gene segments , whereas the relative frequencies of o <dig> and o <dig> 12-crs are not different between vκ and vh gene segments .

even though vκ and vh gene segments and the ac <dig> sequence exhibit similar relative frequencies of potential crs, these frequencies diverge as ric scores increase towards the threshold values associated with rs activity . o <dig> and o <dig> potential 12-crs with ric <dig> ≥ - <dig> are more common in vh gene segments than in the ac <dig> control , while o <dig> and o <dig> potential 23-crs with ric <dig> > - <dig> are less common in vh gene segments than in the ac <dig> control   <cit> . in contrast, of vκ potential 12-crs with ric <dig> ≥ - <dig>  only those in o <dig> are more common than in ac <dig> , and o <dig> potential 23-crs with ric <dig> > - <dig> are more common in vκ gene segments than in the control sequence . as described above, at crs ric score thresholds, these differences are statistically significant.

thus, while both vh and vκ gene segments are significantly enriched for o <dig> 12-crs relative to the ac <dig> control, vh gene segments appear to be selected for increased frequencies of 12-crs and the suppression of 23-crs, regardless of orientation, and vκ gene segments appear to be under selection for o <dig> crs, regardless of spacer length. these patterns of bias indicate that, relative to vh gene segments, vκ segments are enriched for o <dig> 23-crs.

given that the relative frequency of the  <dig> o <dig> 23-crs embedded within vκ gene segments  is much higher than the relative frequency of o <dig> 23-crs in vh gene segments or in ac <dig>  we examine the extent of vκ o <dig> 23-crs conservation, explore whether their conservation can be explained by conservation of the encoded amino acid sequence, and determine whether they are cleaved.

vκ 23-crs in o <dig> are conserved at multiple locations within vκ genes and across vκ gene families
we first examined whether the locations of the  <dig> o <dig> 23-crs within vκ gene segments were conserved across vκ gene families. indeed, a third  are located at nucleotide position  <dig> and one-fourth  at nucleotide position  <dig> in framework  <dig> . about 10%  of o <dig> 23-crs are located at nucleotide position  <dig> in framework  <dig>  and the remaining  <dig> o <dig> 23-crs are distributed across  <dig> other locations . importantly, only  <dig> crs are located at nucleotide position  <dig>  the position of the most highly conserved crs in vh segments and of the crs that mediates vh gene replacement  <cit> .

vκ 23-crs in o <dig> are distributed across vκ gene families. we found ≥  <dig> crs in  <dig> of the  <dig> vκ gene segments analyzed, and most of these  contained multiple crs. further, crs-containing vκ gene segments were identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> vκ gene families:  <dig> of the  <dig> o <dig> 23-crs are present in  <dig> of  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments;  <dig> are present in the  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments;  <dig> in the  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments;  <dig> in the  <dig> vκ <dig> segments;  <dig> in the  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments;  <dig> in  <dig> of the  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments;  <dig> in  <dig> of the  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments; and,  <dig> are present in  <dig> of the  <dig> vκ <dig> gene segments. the remaining  <dig> o <dig> 23-crs are found in families vκ <dig> , vκ <dig> , vκ <dig> , vκ <dig> , vκ <dig> , vκ <dig> , and vκ <dig> .

vκ crs are conserved independently of amino acid sequence
the overrepresentation of o <dig> 23-crs at three conserved locations in vκ gene segments and the wide distribution of these crs across vκ families, suggested that vκ crs are maintained by natural selection. such selection might act directly on the crs dna sequences or indirectly, by selection for specific protein motifs encoded by crs. to illuminate how crs sequences might be conserved, we estimated the dna sequence diversity in the  <dig> functional vκ alleles contained in the imgt reference directory  and compared ho with the maximum diversity possible  for a set of  <dig> nucleotide sequences with amino acid sequences identical to the observed .

ho was estimated by computing the shannon entropy  <cit>  at each nucleotide position employing the observed relative abundances of the four nucleotides. the maximum possible diversity hm was calculated by assuming, for each amino acid observed, a uniform distribution of codons for that amino acid among the subset of vκ sequences with that amino acid at the relevant amino acid position. thus, hm is calculated on the set of  <dig> simulated vκ nucleotide sequences with amino acid sequences identical to the  <dig> observed vκ sequences but with nucleotide sequences as diverse as possible, given the amino acid sequences. this calculation corresponds to the assumption that there is no constraint on evolution of vκ dna sequences beyond maintenance of the amino acid sequences. ho <hm suggests selection acting directly on dna.

to determine whether the difference between ho and hm is greater for nucleotide positions within crs than for other framework region  nucleotide positions, we compared the average difference hm - ho for the  <dig> nucleotide positions in codons that overlap the three conserved crs () with the average difference at all other fr nucleotide positions ().  was computed using nucleotide positions 1– <dig>  196– <dig>  and 238– <dig>  corresponding to amino acid residues 1– <dig>  66– <dig>  and 80– <dig> . the average difference between ho and hm for the nucleotide positions within crs  was higher than that for the other fr nucleotide positions . to determine whether the difference between the two averages  was statistically significant, we randomly assigned each codon the label 'crs' or 'fr', preserving the observed relative abundances of fr codons in and not in crs, and computed  -   <dig> times. only  <dig> of  <dig> permutations resulted in an  -  ≥  <dig>   indicating that the observed difference  -  is statistically significant .

 is significantly greater than  because the difference between ho and hm is greater within crs than for other fr nucleotide positions. thus, the observed dna sequence diversity  for nucleotide positions within fr but not within crs is relatively close to the maximum possible dna sequence diversity  that could be attained while conserving the amino acid sequences for the set of  <dig> functional vκ gene segments. in contrast, the observed dna sequence diversity for nucleotide positions within crs is much less than the maximum possible diversity that could be attained while conserving the amino acid sequences, indicating selection on the dna to a greater extent within crs than within fr and beyond that required to maintain the necessary amino acid sequence. thus, we conclude that the o <dig> 23-crs embedded within vκ gene segments are not present as an artifact of amino acid conservation.

vκ crs are cleaved in vivo
to determine if the vκ o <dig> 23-crs identified by ric scores are cleaved in vivo, we performed ligation-mediated pcr   <cit>  to amplify vκ crs signal ends  recovered from 103/bcl <dig> cells and small pre-b cells from the bone marrow of c57bl/ <dig> mice . lm-pcr is a standard assay used to demonstrate rag-mediated cleavage at rs and crs heptamers  <cit> . rag expression in 103/bcl <dig> cells is temperature dependent. at 34°c, 103/bcl <dig> cells proliferate, rag <dig> and rag <dig> proteins are minimally expressed, and igκ rearrangements are undetectable  <cit> . at 39°c, 103/bcl <dig> cells enter growth arrest, rag <dig> and rag <dig> expression is upregulated, and igκ rearrangements are induced  <cit> . to control for potential lm-pcr artifacts, we used genomic dna from 103/bcl <dig> cells cultured at 34°c and 39°c as lm-pcr templates, in addition to dna from sorted pre-b cells . to determine the extent of functional o <dig> crs in gene segments from the vκ <dig>  vκ <dig>  vκ <dig>  vκ <dig>  and vκ <dig> families, we designed a series of vκ family-specific pcr primers and used a standard intronic lm-pcr  <cit>  to detect primary jκ se as a positive control. the vκ primers are designed such that only o <dig> crs are detected.

lm-pcr amplicands representing rag- and ligase-dependent vκ crs se cleavage products were readily detected in both 103/bcl <dig> and small pre-b cells . the dual products recovered from both 103/bcl <dig> and bone marrow cells using vκ <dig> and vκ <dig> family primers represent cleavage at nucleotide positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  in vκ <dig> gene segments  and at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in vκ <dig> gene segments . similarly, lm-pcr amplifications of genomic dna from 103/bcl <dig> cells using five sets of vκ family-specific primers indicated that ≥  <dig> crs is present and cleaved in v gene segments belonging to the vκ <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> gene families , all of the families for which cleavage was assayed.

to ensure that these lm-pcr amplification products represented bona fide vκ crs se, the lm-pcr amplicands were gel-purified, cloned, and sequenced . of  <dig> sequences obtained,  <dig> represent vκ gene segments ending precisely at blunt, double-strand ends . almost one quarter of the  <dig> vκ lm-pcr products  have unique nucleotide sequences or were obtained from independent pcr reactions and were therefore determined to be the product of independent cleavage events. the  <dig> nucleotides immediately 5' of the cleaved ends are shown for these  <dig> lm-pcr products in table  <dig>  the two sequences from vκ <dig> gene segments indicate cleavage at non-ca nucleotides . the remaining  <dig> sequences represent unique cleavage events precisely at vκ crs heptamers . the  <dig> unique crs cleavage events occurred at  <dig> different vκ nucleotide positions  from  <dig> distinct vκ gene families . although no primer set was used to amplify gene segments of the vκ <dig> and vκ <dig> families, the vκ <dig> primer set matches to both vκ <dig>  and vκ <dig>  genes and resulted in the amplification of a single vκ <dig> crs se product and two vκ <dig> crs se products .

lm-pcr products from 103/bcl <dig> cells and from pre-b cells isolated from rag2:gfp knock-in mice and c57bl/ <dig> mice were sequenced and aligned to sequences from the imgt reference directory set to identify products from cleavage at vκ-embedded crs.

lm-pcr products from 103/bcl <dig> cells and from pre-b cells isolated from rag2:gfp knock-in mice or from c57bl/ <dig> mice were sequenced and aligned to sequences from the imgt reference directory set to identify the germline gene segment. where matches to imgt sequences were not found, the lm-pcr products were aligned to germline vκ gene segments in ncbi . the source, location, number of observations, crs sequence, vκ gene segment, and crs sequence ric score are shown for each independent cleavage event. crs sequences are written in heptamer-to-nonamer orientation, and nucleotide positions using imgt numbering indicate the location of the first heptamer nucleotide.

* the lm-pcr product shows  <dig> mismatches to the genomic crs sequence , indicated with capital letters. we attribute this difference to sequencing error.

three of the  <dig> positions at which vκ crs cleavage was detected  are crs predicted by ric, and two of these  are the most frequent sites for vκ o <dig> 23-crs . position  <dig> is downstream of the coding region of vκ gene segments  and was not considered in our computational analysis. interestingly, crs se at position  <dig> were observed in pre-b and 103/bcl- <dig> cells . cleavage occurred at the 3' end of the physiologic rs heptamer such that the last  <dig> nucleotides  of the physiologic heptamer are the first  <dig> nucleotides  of the crs heptamer. seven of  <dig> unique vκ crs cleavage events were at position 342; the remaining  <dig> were at crs embedded within the vκ gene segment. thus,  <dig> of the  <dig> cleavage events we observe  represent cleavage at crs, and 59% of these represent cleavage at vκ-embedded crs .

six of the  <dig> vκ-embedded crs cleavage events were at nucleotide position  <dig> , the most conserved location for o <dig> 23-crs identified by ric. cleavage at this crs was identified in the vκ6– <dig>  vκ5– <dig>  and vκ5– <dig> gene segments. the remaining  <dig> vκ-embedded crs cleavage events were distributed as follows:  <dig> at vκ nucleotide position  <dig> in vκ2– <dig>   <dig> at position  <dig> in vκ17– <dig>  and  <dig> at position  <dig> in the vκ2– <dig> and vκ2– <dig> gene segments . thus, we observe cleavage events occurring both at the same location across different vκ gene families, and at different locations within the same gene family.

vκ <dig> crs se and jκ <dig> se are approximately equally abundant in recombinationally active 103/bcl <dig> cells . given that the vκ <dig> family comprises eight or nine gene segments  and that each of these likely contain at least two functional crs , we estimate the rate of vκ <dig> crs cleavage to be 5% – 13% of jκ <dig> rs.

vκ crs se are detected only in pre-b cells
to identify the developmental stages in which vκ crs are cleaved, we isolated genomic dna from highly enriched  populations of pro-b, pre-b, and immature b cells sorted from the bone marrow of c57bl/ <dig> mice and congenic rag2:gfp animals  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that vh crs se are present in pro-b cells but not in pre-b or immature b cells from the bone marrow of rag2:gfp mice  <cit> . in this study, jh rs se were detected only in pro-b cells, jκ rs se only in pre-b cells, and tcr dβ rs se were not detected in any b-cell population  <cit> .

to determine if vκ crs are cleaved in vivo and to identify the developmental stage in which cleavage occurs, we isolated genomic dna from the samples of bone marrow pro-, pre-, and immature b cells sorted in the previous study  <cit> . the genomic dna was used as template for lm-pcr to detect cleavage of o <dig> vκ crs in the vκ6– <dig> gene. we targeted this vκ gene segment because it contains multiple crs  with the highest ric scores of the crs for which se were detected in 103/bcl <dig> cells . ligase-dependent, vκ6– <dig> crs se could be detected at nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig>  in pre-b, but not pro-b or immature b cells . these lm-pcr products were validated as vκ6– <dig> crs se by sequencing . thus, vκ crs appear to be cleaved in vivo during the developmental stage that is permissive for primary igκ vκ → jκ rearrangements.

CONCLUSIONS
the adaptive immune system has evolved to generate a diverse antigen-receptor repertoire. one mechanism of somatic diversification is vj recombination, a process that joins antigen-receptor v, d, and j gene segments by initiating double-strand breaks at rs flanking the gene segments . rs at locations other than the boundaries of v, d, and j segments have been identified at both the igh and igκ loci  <cit> . until recently, crs in the igh locus were thought to be limited to the 3' end of vh gene segments where crs can mediate vh gene replacement  <cit> . vh gene replacement can participate in a form of receptor editing at the heavy chain locus, which otherwise is incapable of secondary rearrangements that follow the 12/ <dig> rule  <cit> . it has been proposed that the utility of receptor editing is sufficient to drive the evolutionary conservation of vh crs  <cit> . there is mounting evidence, however, that at least some receptor editing is antigen-independent, and that the conservation of ig vh crs may result from other selective pressures.

the earliest evidence that the regulation of vh replacement is independent of bcr-specificity came from studies  <cit>  that demonstrated frequent vh replacement in mice transgenic for non-autoreactive heavy chains. these data suggested that selection for vh crs includes the capacity for increasing bcr diversification, in addition to self-tolerance  <cit> . we subsequently showed that vh crs se were detected only in pro-b cells, including the pro-b cells of μmt mice which can not assemble functional bcr  <cit> . together, these results support the notion that vh gene replacement may not be driven by the recognition of antigen.

koralov et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that, in transgenic mice homozygous for nonproductive heavy-chain rearrangements, vh replacement events are only three times more frequent than direct vh to jh joining, in violation of the 12/ <dig> rule. these results demonstrate the inefficiency of crs-mediated vh replacement and beg the question: how can such an inefficient mechanism for rescuing autoreactive b cells increase fitness sufficiently to maintain vhcrs conservation? if vh crs are conserved to mediate vh replacement, shouldn't vh replacement at crs be much more efficient than rearrangements in violation of the 12/ <dig> rule? the results of koralov et al.  <cit>  suggest that while vh replacement may be mediated by vh crs, their conservation is unlikely to result only from their role in vh replacement.

unlike the crs associated with igh, the crs previously identified in igκ loci were not embedded in vκ gene segments but sited in the jκ-cκ intron and 3' of cκ and mediated locus inactivation  <cit> . the crs located in the jκ-cκ intron are known as irs , while the crs found 3' of cκ is named the kappa deleting element  in humans and rs in mice. for clarity, we reserve 'rs' for signals adjacent to v, d, and j gene segments, and refer to the signal 3' of cκ in mice as rsκ <dig> 

the structure of the igκ locus allows for secondary vκ → jκ rearrangements. thus, if antigen-driven receptor editing is the primary force behind conservation of v-gene crs  <cit> , vκ gene segments should not be selected for embedded crs. fanning et al.  <cit>  noted the presence of a partial heptamer motif  in vκ gene segments at a location orthologous to the 3' vh crs, but to date, there has been no systematic attempt to identify potential crs at other sites within vκ gene segments or to determine their function. the determination of cleaved crs within vκ gene segments is an important first step in identifying their physiologic role and resolving the selective forces that maintain their conservation.

to determine whether the igκ locus contains active crs embedded in functional vκ gene segments, we conducted a computational scan for crs in vκ gene segments and evaluated their functionality using lm-pcr. our results indicate that, despite the capacity for repeated secondary igκ rearrangements, functional vκ crs have been evolutionarily conserved. vκ crs are primarily conserved in an orientation  opposite to physiologic vκ 12-rs and have 23-bp spacers . this conserved orientation and spacer size mirrors our earlier demonstration that conserved vh crs are oriented opposite to physiologic vh 23-rs and contain 12-bp spacers  <cit> .

as with vh crs, vκ crs are conserved at multiple sites in vκ gene segments and across vκ gene families. although our genomic scan identified relatively few vκ crs at positions analogous to the 3' vh crs  that mediate vh replacement , we did observe two crs se at this location, both in vκ <dig> gene segments . of the  <dig> unique cleavage events at vκ-embedded crs,  <dig> represent crs se ≥  <dig> nucleotides upstream of complementarity determining region   <dig> . v gene replacement  at one of these embedded crs would result in substantially lengthened variable-region product that would be unlikely to produce a typically folded l-chain protein. the conservation of functional crs at such sites in vκ gene segments in a locus capable of secondary vκ → jκ rearrangements implies a function distinct from immunological tolerance.

crs previously identified at the igκ locus  mediate rearrangement events that inactivate the locus and may serve to ensure igκ allelic exclusion or activation of the igλ loci . rearrangements between kde/rsκ <dig> and irs result in the deletion of cκ and rearrangements between kde/rsκ <dig> and vκ rs result in the deletion of jκ and cκ  <cit> . it is possible that the o <dig> vκ 23-crs likewise participate in these inactivation rearrangements, as recombination between irs and o <dig> vκ 23-crs would result in deletion or inversion of the jκ gene segment cluster.

inactivating rearrangements involving irs and kde/rsκ <dig> have been implicated in antigen-induced receptor editing , and kiefer et al.  <cit>  observed rsκ <dig> cleavage in igm- bm pre-b cells, igmlow immature bm b cells, and in igmlowigd+ splenic t3/t3' b cells. our results indicate that cleavage of o <dig> vκ 23-crs is confined to the igm-, small pre-b compartment . we conclude that either vκ crs se are rare relative to rsκ <dig> se, or that vκ crs se are not present in immature b cells  and, consequently, may be unrelated to antigen-driven receptor editing. in either case, despite their frequency and function, vκ crs appear to play a less significant role in antigen-driven genomic change than do irs and kde/rsκ <dig> 

the similarities between the vh and vκ crs suggest that these dna motifs are conserved for a common function. both crs types are conserved at multiple locations, and both are conserved with an orientation and spacer length opposite to the corresponding physiologic v-associated rs. both sets of crs are cleaved coincidentally with the physiologic rs in the same locus. that is, vh crs are cleaved in pro-b cells and vκ crs are cleaved in pre-b cells. we consider below possible mechanisms for conservation of these v-gene crs in the igh and igκ loci.

first, vh and vκ crs could be conserved to inactivate the igh and igκ loci. if so, this inactivation might help to ensure allelic exclusion, as evidence indicates that vh  <cit>  and vκ crs se  do not depend on the generation of a functional b-cell receptor. inactivation of the igκ locus would increase the proportion of λ-expressing b cells and could act to increase the diversity of the bcr repertoire. a similar argument cannot be made for the igh locus as there is no alternative locus. furthermore, the frequency of irs-to-kde/rsκ <dig> rearrangements mitigates any need for v-embedded crs for inactivation at the κ locus. thus, we doubt that the selection pressure resulting from locus inactivation via v crs cleavage is sufficient to result in conservation of the crs.

we previously suggested that v-embedded crs could function to form hybrid v gene segments thereby creating combinatorial diversity beyond that created through the combination of v, d, and j or v and j gene segments  <cit> . while the results are controversial, there is evidence for such hybrid heavy chain v genes  <cit> . given that both vh and vκ crs are conserved in opposite orientation and with the complementary spacer length to physiologic, v-associated rs, we propose that v-embedded crs may be conserved to recombine with physiologic rs to form hybrid v genes. under this model, hybrid v gene formation would proceed by a two-step process. recombination of an o <dig> vκ 23-crs to the same vκ gene segment's physiologic rs would result in deletion of the intervening nucleotides and generation of a sj intermediate. a second recombination event could then occur between the rs of the sj and an o <dig> vκ 23-crs located at the same or a nearby nucleotide position in a downstream vκ gene segment. this two-step rearrangement would be rare, but would result in a novel, hybrid vκ gene segment of approximately normal length. in particular, utilization of o <dig> 23-crs located in fr <dig> would create cdr <dig> – cdr <dig> combinations not present in the germline.

an alternative hypothesis to the conservation of crs for their recombinogenic potential is that the nucleotide sequences are conserved to maintain appropriate v region amino acid sequences, and the corresponding recombinogenic potential is a coincidence. we present evidence that the conservation of o <dig> crs embedded in vh and vκ is not explained by the need to maintain v region amino acid sequences . in vh gene segments, the second, third, and fourth nucleotides of the 3' crs  encode the conserved cysteine at amino acid position  <dig> , while the codon for the conserved cysteine at amino acid position  <dig>  is not part of any known crs. cysteine is degenerately encoded, and we find that only 38% of cys <dig> are encoded by tgt  <cit> . ninety-eight percent of cys <dig> are encoded by tgt, however, providing evidence for selection pressure to maintain the recombinogenic potential of the 3' vh crs  <cit> . similarly, analysis of fr codons in vκ gene segments shows that codon diversity at crs is reduced relative to the maximum possible to a significantly greater extent than at any other fr site , a finding that implies stringent selection against synonymous nucleotide substitutions in the crs. the absence of synonymous mutations is important given that the predicted recombinogenic potential of most conserved  o <dig> vκ 23-crs could be eliminated by a single, synonymous nucleotide substitution . of the remaining  <dig> crs, the recombinogenic potential for  <dig> of them would be significantly reduced  by one synonymous nucleotide substitution . thus, while nucleotide substitutions in crs motifs that eliminate efficient recombination without altering vκ amino acid sequence are potentially frequent, they are rare or absent in the genome. we conclude that there is evolutionary selection for vh- and vκ-embedded o <dig> crs.

another alternative hypothesis to the conservation of v-gene crs for their recombinogenic potential is that the crs nonamers are conserved for nucleosome positioning. consensus rs nonamers may contribute to nucleosome positioning and influence rs accessibility to the vj recombinase  <cit> . while the crs nonamers may influence nucleosome positioning, this property is unlikely to explain conservation of v-gene crs. first, ric scores are based on the complete crs sequence, and above-threshold ric scores would not result from conserved nonamer motifs alone. second, cleaved vκ crs  do not contain consensus nonamers and lack the stretch of adenosine nucleotides thought to be responsible for nucleosome positioning  <cit> . thus, it is unlikely that selection for nucleosome positioning motifs has resulted in the maintenance of functional vκ crs.

we provide the first exhaustive search using a rigorous method for crs embedded in vκ gene segments. we demonstrate not only that vκ crs are conserved, but also that they are cleaved in vivo. we show that the patterns of conservation for vκ crs are analogous to those for vh  <cit> , namely that the v-embedded crs are conserved with an orientation and spacer length opposite to that for v-associated rs in the same locus. we provide evidence that these v-embedded crs are not conserved as a consequence of selection pressure to maintain v region amino acid sequence and explore several possible explanations for their conservation. while the role of these v-gene crs is not yet clear, their conservation in both vh  <cit>  and vκ gene segments implies a substantial evolutionary benefit to their presence.
