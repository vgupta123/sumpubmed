BACKGROUND
the genomes of eukaryotes are packaged into nucleosomes, comprised of approximately  <dig> base pairs of double-stranded dna wrapped around an octamer of the highly conserved histone subunits <cit> . histones are the most abundant dna binding proteins in the cell, and occupy ~80% of the yeast genome in vivo <cit> . in the past few decades, it has become clear that the biological roles of nucleosomes extend far beyond simple dna packaging, to include replication, dna repair, recombination, and transcriptional regulation <cit> . active regulatory sequences are often depleted of nucleosomes <cit> , presumably due to steric hindrance constraints between nucleosomes and binding of most other dna-binding proteins. the interplay between histones, dna, and other dna-binding proteins is therefore critical to the orchestration of transcription and other functions of the genome.

in s. cerevisiae, studies examining the relative incorporation of yeast genomic dna into nucleosomes in vitro have demonstrated that nucleosome depletion at promoters is to a large extent programmed into the dna sequence <cit> . these experiments were conducted using chicken <cit>  or human <cit>  histones, which, when assembled onto yeast genomic dna, adopted a configuration that closely resembles that of yeast nucleosomes in vivo. therefore these results also indicate that the sequence preferences of nucleosomes are likely to be broadly conserved across eukarya.

to fully understand the function and evolution of gene regulation and genome packaging, it will be essential to understand the sequence preferences of nucleosomes. a variety of sequence cues have been shown to influence nucleosome sequence preference. these include nucleosome positioning <cit>  and excluding <cit>  sequences, as well as many local structural features that describe the overall deformability, curvature and flexibility of double stranded dna <cit>  that could affect nucleosome occupancy and arrangement at particular sites in the genome. methods to predict nucleosome positioning and occupancy from sequence have often relied on periodic dinucleotide patterns found in collections of nucleosomal sequences from both in vivo and in vitro experiments <cit>  and these patterns can explain a fraction of nucleosome positions in vivo <cit> . however, analyses of sequences highly enriched in nucleosome-occupied and nucleosome-depleted regions in genome-scale and genome-wide data sets have highlighted the importance of nucleosome-excluding sequences, in particular poly-da/dt tracts <cit> , and incorporation of these features into models of nucleosome occupancy has markedly improved prediction accuracy  <cit> . some of these studies have also noted that the observed nucleosome occupancy in vivo correlates with and can be predicted by base composition  <cit>  and other structural features of dna  <cit> , many of which, on their own, correlate with base composition. however, these observations were based on in vivo nucleosome occupancy, and did not directly demonstrate intrinsic nucleosome sequence preference.

kaplan et al. <cit>  showed recently that a probabilistic model  using the composition of all 5-mers within a 147-base tiling window accurately predicts nucleosome occupancy across an entire genome in vitro. the kaplan model should inherently capture the effects of both base composition and aspects of large-scale structural properties which are thought to depend primarily on dinucleotide content <cit> . however, the relative contributions of individual sequence features and properties are not readily apparent from the kaplan model, which contained over  <dig>  parameters. to our knowledge, there currently exists no systematic assessment of the impact of individual nucleosome excluding/attracting sequences on intrinsic nucleosome preference on a genomic scale, nor an examination of which features are redundant or dispensable in a combined model.

here we used lasso <cit> , a linear regression algorithm, to derive a greatly-simplified model for intrinsic nucleosome sequence preference. we used lasso because:  model generation is fast for large data sets ,  lasso does subset selection, such that if given a set of highly correlated features, it will weight those that have the greatest impact, setting other feature weights to  <dig>  thereby reducing the number of features in the final model, and  the end result is a simple linear equation, containing a set of easily interpreted weights for each feature. in our analysis, we obtained very similar models regardless of training/test divisions of the yeast genome, and we selected for further analysis one model that contains only  <dig> features and has predictive capacity nearly identical to the kaplan model. while the  <dig> feature model is trained on the kaplan in vitro data, it performs comparably or better than the best previous models on in vivo data in both yeast and c. elegans. the  <dig> feature model is heavily dependent on g+c and poly-a content, with g+c having the highest independent correlation with measured nucleosome occupancy. we suggest possible explanations and implications of the strong association between g+c content and intrinsic nucleosome occupancy.

RESULTS
we first performed a feature selection step to identify which sequence features known or believed to influence nucleosome occupancy or positioning correlate with or are strongly associated with the in vitro nucleosome data of kaplan et al. <cit> . table s <dig>  lists the  <dig> features tested and the results of the tests. the features included:  mononucleotide frequency ;  predicted dna structural characteristics ;  nucleosome positioning and excluding sequences from the literature <cit> ; and  the frequency of 4-bp sequences over a 150-bp window. we used 4-mers instead of 5-mers  in order to limit the number of features, and to obtain inputs that correlate independently with nucleosome occupancy . we identified  <dig> features that we deemed to be associated with in vitro nucleosome occupancy across the yeast genome , including representatives of all categories  above .

we then used lasso to learn linear models that relate these  <dig> features to the kaplan et al. data. we created eleven different models, using eleven different random samples of  <dig> , <dig> genomic positions selected from subsets of the yeast genome as training data, each with 10-fold internal cross-validation . in each case, lasso assigned nonzero weights to a similar set of features , each of which yielded a roughly comparable correlation to test data. this result indicates that the model chosen is not strongly dependent on the subset of the data used for training. from among the models, we chose the model trained on chromosomes 1- <dig> for further analysis, on the basis that  it was an arbitrary selection, being the first model sorted numerically, and  it has  <dig> features, which is the median number among the eleven runs. hereafter, we refer to this model as the " <dig> feature model", the formula for which is given in the methods section.

the  <dig> feature model explains a large majority of the variation in nucleosome occupancy over the yeast genome in the kaplan et al. in vitro data <cit>   . this correlation is near the level of experimental reproducibility reported by kaplan et al. , and similar to that of the kaplan model that learned  <dig>  parameters  <cit> . we note that our models with substantially more than  <dig> features have correlations with the in vitro data as high as  <dig>  . the  <dig> feature model also correlates significantly with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in yeast  <cit>   . the kaplan model has a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  over the same test data. thus, the  <dig> feature model encapsulates the vast majority of the information in the kaplan model. indeed, the correlation between the  <dig> feature model and the kaplan model over the entire yeast genome is  <dig>  .

in order to further benchmark our model, we compared the performance of the  <dig> feature model with published models <cit>  on other in vitro and in vivo nucleosome occupancy data sets, using pearson correlation between predicted and actual data. these results are summarized in table  <dig>  in all cases, the  <dig> feature model has performance comparable to the kaplan model and to another model  from the same lab with a similar number of parameters as the kaplan model <cit> . since the  <dig> feature model is trained on illumina/solexa sequencing data, which may have inherent biases <cit> , it is important to note that it also correlates well with an in vivo nucleosome organization from a tiling array study in yeast <cit>  and a sequencing-based study in c. elegans that was normalized using naked genomic dna processed in the same fashion as the nucleosomal dna <cit> , performing the best out of all models tested on the latter data set. thus, our model is comparable to the kaplan model on multiple data sets, including those generated in vivo, using other methods, and/or in an organism distantly related to yeast.

pearson correlation is shown as a performance metric. nucleosome occupancy was predicted in yeast using only sequence from the test set  and chromosome iii in c. elegans. "nan" indicates that a score of "0" was obtained for each sequence . models are sorted by their average rank in performance. asterisks  and text in bold denote the top three and top 50% performing models for each data set, respectively.

the results from this comparison also confirm that models that combine aperiodic signals perform much better at predicting nucleosome occupancy than models based primarily on periodic dinucleotide signals <cit> . the one exception is the model of yuan and liu <cit> , which is based on periodic dinucleotide signals in nucleosomal and linker sequences identified using wavelet analysis. we note, however, that the dinucleotide features with most predictive power and the highest regression coefficients in the yuan and liu model have frequencies at the single base scale  <cit> , suggesting that aperiodic dinucleotide composition is, perhaps unintentionally, a major component.

the most critical features in the  <dig> feature model are g+c content and frequency of aaaa, on the basis of two criteria. first, these two features correlate highly with nucleosome occupancy in vitro , independently of all other features . second, a procedure in which we iteratively removed the least critical feature of the model  resulted in aaaa and g+c being the last two components removed . a two-feature linear model  retained a correlation on test data of  <dig> , only a marginal improvement over g+c alone . from this analysis, we conclude that g+c content independently accounts for approximately half of the variation in intrinsic nucleosome occupancy . we note that the kaplan model weights for individual 5-mers also scale highly with g+c content  and that the scores assigned by the kaplan model to 147-base windows across the yeast genome correlate highly with g+c content . table  <dig> shows that other models that correlate highly with g+c content  perform well at predicting nucleosome occupancy in vitro and in vivo, and that g+c content itself is a good predictor in all data sets : in all data sets examined, %g+c had a higher correlation that the majority of published models tested at predicting nucleosome occupancy.

we next sought to understand why these  <dig> features are repeatedly retained in linear models . manual inspection of the components of the  <dig> feature model suggests a small number of overarching themes. all  <dig> of the 4-mers are a/t rich , and models of dna structure suggest that they should retain some of the structural character of poly-a sequences . poly-a stretches are believed to exclude nucleosomes because they are both rigid and bent, making them less compatible with the extreme bending required for nucleosome formation, regardless of their local sequence context <cit> . sequences high in g+c will tend to lack these  sequences, which may partly explain why g+c content has high overall predictive value; however, it is possible for sequences to be both g+c rich and contain small nucleosome excluding sequences, which would negatively impact nucleosome formation, explaining why a variety of poly-a-like 4-mers are retained in the model.

the importance of g+c may also be explained by the fact that this single parameter affects virtually all aspects of dna structure. indeed, the two overall dna structural properties selected , both correlate well with g+c content when calculated as an average over a tiling window using dinucleotide tables <cit>  . these and the majority of other dna structural properties also correlate either positively or negatively with both g+c content and nucleosome occupancy in vitro and in vivo . thus, the  <dig> feature model is also likely to be dominated by g+c because this parameter influences a large number of structural attributes of dna, perhaps most critically propeller twist and slide, which may also be sufficiently important that their deviations from simple g+c content cause them to be retained in the lasso regression. there is prior evidence for the importance of one of these features in nucleosome formation: poly-a and related sequences are rigid and bent precisely because they are high in propeller twist, resulting in a continuous network of bifurcated hydrogen bonds <cit> .

to gain more direct evidence for separability between g+c content and poly-a sequences as determinants of intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, we examined g+c content and poly-a sequences in an independent data set in the kaplan et al. paper, in which nucleosomes were assembled with synthetic 150-mer sequences designed to have a broader range of unusual sequence attributes than are present in the yeast genome. since the synthetic 150-mer nucleosome occupancy data was described by kaplan et al. as noisier than the yeast genomic dna occupancy data <cit> , due to two rounds of pcr required in the experiment, we first confirmed that the synthetic 150-mer data set displays the same global trends with respect to dna structural parameters as does yeast genomic dna, both in vitro or in vivo . we then asked whether g+c content and poly-a sequences act independently by examining the effect of one variable while holding the other within a narrow range. figure 5a and 5b show that these parameters do act independently to a considerable degree; g+c has a major effect even if there are no poly-a tracts of length greater than three, and poly-a tracts have a clear effect even if placed in a 150-mer with neutral g+c content. we note that the behaviour at the extremes of g+c content in figure 5a is inconsistent with the dependence of g+c shown in figure 3b; however, there are very few data points at the extremes . the in vivo relevance of these extremes may be very small: there are no nucleosome-sized sequence windows in yeast that are greater than 80% or less than 20% g+c, and the same is nearly true in much larger genomes . even human cpg islands are only 66% g+c on average. cpg-like sequences <cit>  among the ~ <dig>  oligonucleotides in this analysis <cit>  do have high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy overall, even if they contain poly-a sequence .

our model confirms and extends previous indications that g+c content is a major determinant of nucleosome sequence preference, demonstrating the importance of g+c content on intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. we propose that it represents a "summary feature" that both biases against poly-a-like tracts and encapsulates multiple dna structural attributes. the  <dig> feature model we derive provides an extremely simple means to assess the intrinsic preference for nucleosomes to form on a given segment of dna. moreover, it can be used to evaluate why the segment has an intrinsic preference, in comparison to other sequences; the expected distribution of values for all of the model features in random sequence or across a genome is easily determined. we note that the  <dig> feature model does not contain any periodic component; kaplan et al. also found that periodic signal added little to the probabilistic model <cit> . we previously proposed that the predominant role of this signal may be to reinforce local translational or rotational settings <cit> , and we emphasize that our  <dig> feature model does not explicitly predict either nucleosome positioning or translational settings, nor does it account for steric effects. nonetheless, the model scores closely mirror actual in vitro occupancy data obtained for the entire yeast genome, and also have strong correlations to in vivo nucleosome occupancy in yeast and c. elegans as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> similarly or more strongly than any previous model or algorithm, and much higher than most previous approaches, particularly those that rely solely on periodic signals.

finally, we note that g+c content as a major determinant of nucleosome occupancy has major implications for genome organisation. our analysis indicates that in yeast simple nucleotide composition plays a direct role in nucleosome exclusion, and presumably in demarcation of promoters. local biases in nucleotide composition have been reported in other eukaryotes, including cpg islands <cit> , isochores <cit> , and transcription start sites <cit> . it will be of interest to examine how variation in base content impacts nucleosome occupancy and chromatin structure in other genomes, whether there are functional consequences, and how the intrinsic nucleosome formation signals interact with overlapping regulatory signals in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a simple predictive model of intrinsic nucleosome occupancy in which base composition  is a major component. g+c content may be a dominant feature because it correlates with many structural properties of dna, and also reduces the frequency of poly-a-like stretches. since local variations in g+c content occur at many types of features in diverse eukaryotic genomes, our findings suggest that nucleotide composition may have a widespread and direct influence on chromatin structure.
