BACKGROUND
contagious equine metritis , which was first reported in thoroughbred mares during the  <dig> breeding season in the uk  <cit> , is an important bacterial genital infectious disease of horses caused by taylorella equigenitalis. cem generally leads to a loss of fertility in mares and the disruption of breeding programs. since the first report of cem, this disease and its causative agent have been detected in many countries and in various breeds of horses  <cit> . diagnosis of cem has been performed by the isolation of t. equigenitalis, a nonmotile gram-negative coccobacillus, cultured by means of conventional selective bacteriological techniques.

in relation to the phylogenetic positioning of t. equigenitalis, bleumink-pluym et al. were the first to determine 16s rdna sequences from three strains of t. equigenitalis  to be identical and demonstrated this organism to belong to the Î² subclass of the class proteobacteria  <cit> . when jang et al. analyzed the phylogenetic position of t. asinigenitalis, which is a new second species within the genus taylorella, and a gram-negative, non-motile coccobacilli but phenotypically indistinguishable from t. equigenitalis, which was isolated from donkey jacks  in the usa, in  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , they described that t. equigenitalis appears to be homogeneous with respect to the 16s rdna sequence, since all  <dig> strains,  , together with the published sequence , were 100% identical  <cit> .

recently, our research group determined the 16s rdna sequences of three additional strains, a british type strain nctc11184t, an american prototype strain kentucky  <dig> and a japanese strain eq <dig> of t. equigentalis, and demonstrated sequence differences in the six 16s rdna sequences including three reference sequences, whose accession numbers are shown in table  <dig>  <cit> . consequently, at present, six accessible sequences of 16s rdna from t. equigenitalis, whose sequence differences occur at a few nucleotide positions are available.

therefore, it is important to determine these sequences from additional strains in other countries, if possible, in order to clarify any anomalies regarding 16s rdna sequence heterogeneity. therefore, the authors wished to clone and sequence the approximately full-length 16s rdna from more strains of t. equigenitalis isolated in japan, australia and france and compare these sequences among the existing published sequences described above.

RESULTS
as shown in table  <dig> , the nucleotide sequence differences were demonstrated at six loci in the  <dig> nucleotide sequence of the nearly full-length 16s rdna, among  <dig> strains  isolated in japan, australia and france . moreover,  <dig> polymorphic sites occurred among  <dig> sequences of the 16s rdna, including the six reference sequences, as demonstrated in table  <dig>  in relation to the three countries, japan, australia and france, the strains from each respective country, interestingly, gave an identical sequence. moreover, these strains whose 16s rdna sequences were analyzed, are from all over the world and carried distinct multiple genotypes  <cit> . in addition, the sequences of two american strains  used as references in the present study are different on some positions.

consequently, in the present study, a high sequence similarity of 16s rdna  with the nine polymorphic sites was observed, between np  <dig> and  <dig>  of a total of  <dig>  where substitutions and deletions were noted. thus, there is a single polymorphic site in the approximately 2/ <dig> of the 16s rdna sequence between np  <dig> and  <dig>  while the first approximately 1/ <dig> between np  <dig> and  <dig> has nine polymorphic sites among  <dig> strains, suggesting an extremely high sequence similarity in the approximately 2/ <dig> downstream of the 16s rdna sequence of t. equigenitalis.

discussion
recently, jang et al. demonstrated that the 16s rdna of t. equigenitalis gave  <dig> % sequence similarity to those of t. asinigenitalis  <cit> . in relation to one of the present molecular guidelines, it is suggested that 3% sequence variation of the 16s rdna sequence is a threshold value to represent distinctly different bacterial species  <cit>  however, most recently, some examples of lower levels of 16s rdna sequence variations were found among some campylobacter species  <cit> . the organisms within the genus taylorella are also an example of lower levels of 16s rdna sequence variation.

CONCLUSIONS
the 16s rdna sequences of t. equigenitalis were demonstrated to give high sequence similarity  to each other among  <dig> sequences, but were not identical. lower levels of 16s rdna sequence variations were confirmed among the organisms of the genus taylorella.
