BACKGROUND
the surface of the intestine epithelium is the site where nutrients are absorbed into the body. this absorption function is aided by expanding the surface area of the gut into villi at the tissue level and microvilli at the cellular level. consequently, the mouse and human intestine has become a model for studying how this large surface develops during embryogenesis, the role of stem cells in the renewal of the epithelium, and development of colorectal cancer  <cit> . however, these complex problems can be studied in a simpler system, the zebrafish , which has emerged as an important vertebrate model for study of not only human development but also diseases  <cit> .

so far, morphological development of zebrafish intestine has been relatively well characterized in embryos and larvae  <cit> , however, the organization and physiology of digestive tract has not been specifically documented for adult zebrafish although several books are available for description of general fish intestine anatomy  <cit> . zebrafish, like many fish, lacks a morphologically and functionally distinct stomach and does not express genes that encode specific gastric functions  <cit> . sections of intact zebrafish embryos and juveniles from whole animal serial sections and microct tomography reveal the digestive tract from pharynx and esophagus to the three sections of the folded intestine and anus  <cit> . previous studies have described the zebrafish intestine as a tapered tube that begins at the esophageal junction and is folded into three sections, the large diameter rostral intestinal bulb, the mid-intestine, and the small diameter caudal intestine  <cit> . however, it is not known whether these regions are functionally distinct or whether their functions correspond to the mammalian stomach, small intestine or large intestine. in this study, we characterized the anterior-posterior axis of adult zebrafish intestine at tissue, cellular and molecular levels. by comparing the morphological and molecular characteristics, we identified structurally and functionally distinct areas that correspond to the small intestine and large intestine but not stomach.

RESULTS
architectural differences along the zebrafish intestinal tract
the anterior-posterior axis of the digestive tract has been previously described for embryonic and juvenile zebrafish  <cit>  and cyprinids  <cit> . in summary, the adult digestive tract consists of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, intestine, and anus . however, the zebrafish belongs to the group of stomach-less fishes in which the intestine transits directly from esophagus. in adult fish, it is folded into three sections: the rostral intestinal bulb, mid-intestine and caudal intestine , as previously reported by wallance et al  <cit> . when dissected from the animal and freed of the surrounding mesentery, the intestine remains folded by two turns into three straight regions that correspond anatomically to the three portions as observed in vivo . their diameters decrease along the anterior-posterior axis .

to characterize intestinal function, we subdivided the intestinal bulb, mid-intestine, and caudal sections into seven segments, s1-s <dig>  and examined their architecture under a light microscope. we observe that the zebrafish intestine surface in segments s1-s <dig> is covered by ridges that are oriented circumferentially across the intestine axis .

cross-sections of the intestinal segments reveal a simple architecture for the zebrafish digestive tract of a mucosa, muscularis externa and serosa layer . the intestinal mucosa consists obviously of columnar-shaped enterocytes and mucous-secreting goblet cells. other types of cells such as enteroendocrine cells may be identified by special staining or gfp transgenic labelling  <cit> . an underlying lamina propria contains blood capillaries, lymphatic vessels, muscle fibres and mesenchymal cells. the general architecture of zebrfish intestine, as revealed through cross-sections, resembles that of the mammalian intestine as described previously  <cit> . the mucosal layer is directly ensheathed by circular and longitudinal smooth muscle tiers of the muscularis externa within which are embedded the plexus of myenteric neurons as reported previously  <cit> . in the mammalian duodenum, a typical submucosal layer contains brunner's glands, the branched tubular or branched tubuloalveolar glands that produce alkaline secretions to neutralize the acidic chime entering the duodenum  <cit> . however, in the zebrafish intestine the submucosa layer and brunner's glands are absent .

consistent with our earlier observations of intestinal ridges in segments s <dig> to s <dig> and absence of ridges in s <dig>  these ridges in cross-section resemble the spatially separate villi in the mouse or human small intestine . in contrast to the mammalian intestine, crypts are absent from the base of the ridges and specialized crypt cells such as paneth cells are not observed  <cit> . the villar ridges are comparable in height from segments s <dig> to s <dig> , and absent in segment s <dig> . segments s5-s <dig> often contain compact excretions that are ensheathed by a mucous layer . in addition to the absence of villi, segment s <dig> is distinguished by its lining of abundant goblet cells that are interspersed by absorptive epithelial cells . the muscularis externa is apparent, but the mucosa layer, in general, appears very thin compared with other segments of the intestine. thus, based on histology and architecture, the intestinal lining is divided into three morphologically distinct regions, segments s1- <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> 

distinct molecular signatures along the zebrafish intestinal tract
based on gross morphology, segments s1-s <dig> are similar while segments s <dig> and s <dig> are different. these differences in structure suggest that there should be inherent differences in function. to test this idea, we examined and compared the molecular signatures of each segment by profiling their transcriptional activity. using a standard bonferroni corrected p-value <  <dig>   applied to results from a one-way anova analysis, we identified  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed in at least one of the seven segments and organized the genes by hierarchical clustering analysis  <cit>   for similarities in patterns of gene expression. this analysis sorted the seven segments in their anatomical sequence, s1-s <dig> with s1-s <dig> more similar to each other than to segments, s <dig> and s <dig> 

to understand the significance of the clusters, we then applied a threshold of  <dig>  fold against pooled rna extracted from whole adult zebrafish to the set of  <dig>  genes from the anova analysis. this analysis shows the numbers of genes that are abundantly expressed in each individual segment are:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . to determine the extent to which genes are commonly expressed along the intestinal tract, we determined the overlap in gene sets between pairs of adjacent segments . consistent with the clustering results in figure 3a, significant intersection was found between segments s1-s <dig> . however, segments s <dig> and s <dig> express quite different sets of genes than the anterior segments. s <dig> and s <dig> overlap in  <dig> % genes while s <dig> and s <dig> share only  <dig> % genes in common. similar results were also observed from analysis of down-regulated genes .

to confirm these patterns of overlap, we identified a number of genes that were either highly expressed in segments s1-s <dig>  or in segments s <dig> and s <dig> , suggesting a comprehensive functional transition along the zebrafish intestine . the expression patterns of vil1l , fabp <dig> , apoa <dig> , apoa <dig> , cfl <dig> , zgc: <dig> , typ  and ctsl <dig>  were confirmed by real time rt-pcr. thus, based on the molecular analyses, the zebrafish intestine can be divided into three molecularly distinct regions as represented by segments s1-s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  respectively.

molecular features of the small and large intestine-like functions
having shown the intestine can be subdivided into three regions, s1-s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  based on similarities in expressed genes, we investigated whether the identity of the genes gives insight into intestine function and thus we selected several intestinal marker genes for more detailed analysis.

the functions of the mouse and human small intestine have been characterized by well known molecular markers including fabp <dig>  <cit> , vil1l  <cit> , apoa <dig> and apoa <dig>  <cit> . all of these genes were detected in s1-s <dig> in our microarray analyses by their higher levels of expression compared with total rnas from whole fish  and confirmed by real time rt-pcr analyses . intestinal fabp <dig> gene encodes a fatty acid binding protein that is specifically involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids in the small intestine  <cit> . this gene is highly conserved in teleosts, amphibians, avians and mammals  <cit> . previously, an rfp transgenic zebrafish line under the intestinal fabp <dig> promoter, tg, has been generated and rfp reporter gene is specifically expressed in the intestine  <cit> . to further verify the expression of intestinal fabp <dig>  we isolated an intestine from a 3-month-old tg transgenic zebrafish and found that rfp fluorescence was high in segments s1-s <dig>  but quickly diminished around the second turn of the intestine . this expression pattern was also confirmed by direct detection of endogenous fabp <dig> mrna expression by in situ hybridization . closely resembling the pattern of fabp <dig> expression, villin expression is also restricted to the mammalian gastrointestinal tracts where it is highly expressed in the small intestine  <cit> . our microarray data show that zebrafish villin gene  is highly expressed in segments s1-s <dig> and its expression is reduced in segments s <dig> and s <dig>  this finding is further validated by real time rt-pcr , where the expression of vil1l decreases in segment s <dig> and to a negligible level in segments s <dig> and s <dig>  in further support that segments s1-s <dig> possess features of a small intestine, another two conserved markers, apoa <dig> and apoa <dig>  also showed similar expression pattern to fabp <dig> and vil1l genes along the anterior-posterior axis of zebrafish intestine. these two genes can also be considered to be reliable molecular markers for small intestine because in  <dig> human tissues and  <dig> mouse tissues examined, expression of mammalian apoa <dig> and apoa <dig> are highly restricted to the digestive organs including small intestine and liver . these patterns of small intestine markers together with the transcriptome data suggest that the small intestine comprises segments s1-s <dig> and transition into a different function occurs in segment s <dig> 

if segments s1-s <dig> are small intestine-like, then we investigated whether s5-s <dig> expresses gene markers for the large intestine. two genes, cfl <dig>  and aqp <dig> , distinguish segments s5-s <dig> from s1-s <dig>  cfl <dig> belongs to a family of actin-binding proteins and mediates dynamic stabilization of actin filaments  <cit> . our microarray and real time rt-pcr data  indicate that cfl <dig> is primarily expressed in segments s5-s <dig>  but down-regulated in the first four segments. analysis of rat est database suggests that cfl <dig> is expressed in the large intestine but not in the small intestine . similarly, our microarray data indicated increased expression of aqp <dig>  an osomoregulatory channel protein on membrane of epithelial cells  <cit> , particularly in the large intestine of mammals  <cit>  and mucus cells of the posterior intestine of teleost eel  <cit> , in segments s <dig> and s <dig> . aquaporins are water channel proteins that facilitate water movement, hence increase water permeability, across cell membrane and the increase expression of aqp <dig> is therefore important for absorption of water in the intestine, in particular, for the faecal dehydration in the large intestine. in line with this, the mammalian aquaporin  <dig> is expressed along the gastrointestinal tract, with its highest expression in the colon  <cit> . thus, while segments s1-s <dig> possess molecular features of small intestine, segments s <dig> and s <dig> have molecular features of large intestine with segment s <dig> as a transitional region).

analysis of gene ontology  along the anterior-posterior axis
to infer the functions of the intestinal segments, 2-fold up-regulated genes against the whole fish reference rna were extracted for the three groups, s1-s <dig> , s <dig> , and s <dig> . we envision that these significantly up-regulated genes should better represent specific functions of different intestinal segments and thus gene ontology analyses were carried out for these genes using gotree machine  <cit> . significantly enriched  categories in each region are shown in additional file  <dig> 

as expected from a major metabolic organ, the intestine of zebrafish harbours a rich collection of genes involved in metabolism, molecular transport and localization, catalytic activities among others. however, major differences were found between the three groups of s1-s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  there are  <dig> categories that were statistically enriched in s1-s <dig>  but only  <dig> categories in s <dig> and  <dig> categories in s <dig>  among these enriched categories, up-regulated genes in s1-s <dig> are involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, including metabolism of fatty acid, organic acid, lipid, vitamin, heme, alcohol, glucose, hexose, monosacchride, carbohydrate, etc. . they also play important roles in energy generation and homeostasis of ion, iron and cations. notably, a group of genes are associated with catalytic activities such as hydrolase activity and transferase activity, which are important for the absorptive function of the small intestine. the variety of go categories in the s1-s <dig> group supports the multiple functions of this part of zebrafish intestine with features of the small intestine .

the s <dig> and s <dig> groups, on the other hand, only show a few statistically enriched categories. for example, genes from s <dig> are involved in oxidoreductase activities while genes from s <dig> are enriched in biosynthesis of vitamin and pyridine nucleotide . they are also involved in intracellular signaling and pentosyl/phosphoribosyl transferase activity. it seems that segments s <dig> and s <dig> represent two regions of zebrafish intestine that perform tasks apparently different from those of s1-s <dig> 

cross-species gene set enrichment analysis  indicates the segments s1-s <dig> to be multi-functional
an independent approach to confirm the identity of the intestine sections as small and large intestine is by taking the three gene set pools from s1-s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> and comparing them by gsea analysis against the whole transcriptomes of the mouse and human stomach, small intestine and large intestine . results, summarized in table  <dig>  show segments s1-s <dig> closely resemble the small intestines of mouse and human with highly significant fdr values . segments s1-s <dig> show little resemblance to stomach  and no resemblance to the human cecum. gene ontology analysis shows that majority of the genes corresponding to the leading edge of the gsea curve are involved in the metabolism of lipid, fatty acid, cholesterol and glycerolipid, or involved in peptidase, oxidoreductase activity, reminiscent of the activities of the mammalian small intestine .

#numbers represent false discovery rate : *** highly significant ; ** significant ; * marginally significant .

in contrast to segments s1-s <dig>  segment s <dig> closely resembles the cecum and rectum of the human large intestine , while segment s <dig> resembles human rectum only . gene ontology analysis shows that s <dig> resembles human cecum in glycolysis, oxidoreductase activity, metabolism of amino acid, amine derivative, organic acid, carboxylic acid and alcohol. while in s <dig>  metabolism of membrane lipid was found to be enriched. water retention is a common function in mammalian large intestine. consistent with this, several aquaporin genes, including aquaporins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are highly expressed in s6/s <dig>  in particular, aquaporin  <dig> is well known a key component of faecal dehydration in mammalian colon  <cit> . interestingly, although s1-s <dig> most closely resembles the small intestine, we detected some significant similarity with functions found in the human colon and rectum , suggesting that the zebrafish segments s1-s <dig> may have broader functions. this phenomena may reflect the less specialized and differentiated features of fish intestine as a primitive species of vertebrates. this is particularly true for fish "small intestine"  as it constitutes more than two thirds of the length of the intestine.

in summary, gsea analysis supports that segments s1-s <dig> of zebrafish intestine possess features of a mammalian small intestine, while segments s <dig> and s <dig> possess features of a mammalian large intestine .

stomach-like functions of the intestine
a striking feature of the zebrafish anatomy is the absence of stomach  <cit> . to understand whether the gut carries out a cryptic gastric function, we examined the zebrafish genes encoding enzymes including pepsin and some digestive proteases with implications of functions of a stomach. mammalian pepsinogens are classified into three major groups and two minor groups  <cit> , however, a pepsinogen gene in zebrafish has never been reported. we searched for potential pepsinogen sequences in the zebrafish genome. first, we conducted a blast search against the ensembl genome database http://www.ensembl.org using sequences of human pgc  and pga  but did not detect any significant hits relevant to the pepsinogen gene. then in a more specific tblastn search  <cit>  using the pfam <dig> domain that is well conserved across all aspartic proteases in vertebrates, we identified pepsinogen genes as well as some aspartic protease genes in human, mouse, xenopus and fugu fish, together with a few zebrafish aspartic protease genes and a putative gene sequence encoding a hypothetical protein np <dig> . to determine whether these zebrafish sequences could represent a pepsinogen gene, relevant amino acid sequences were aligned, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using quartet puzzling algorithm implemented in the tree-puzzle program  <cit> , and the result was visualized by treeviewx  <cit> . our analysis suggests that the zebrafish has genes coding for rennin, nothepsin and several members of cathepsins . however, none of these zebrafish genes resemble the mammalian pepsinogen genes. the genome search results and phylogeny analysis results together suggest that the pepsinogen gene locus is not present in the zebrafish genome.

whereas pepsinogen is not encoded in the zebrafish genome, other stomach markers may be expressed by the intestine. for example, lipf is a gastric lipase gene encoding an acidophilic lipase known to be secreted by mammalian gastric chief cells  <cit> . its expression in human is restricted to esophagus, stomach and several other tissues, but not in the intestine . in contrast, lipf is expressed in all seven segments of the zebrafish intestine and not restricted to any particular segment .

discussion
for comparison of similarity between zebrafish fragments, we used differentially expressed genes generated by anova . for go  and gsea  analyses, we selected 2-fold up-regulated genes against the reference rna  and this selection was independent of the initial set of differentially expressed genes selected by anova for similarity analyses. our approach would filter out ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes. abundantly expressed intestine-specific or enriched transcripts will be retained by the 2-fold selection as their concentrations in the total fish rna pool would be diluted much more than  <dig> fold. we have also tried  <dig> -fold selection, basically the same gsea results were obtained .

the results in this study document that the zebrafish intestine is regionally segmented into a small intestine and large intestine. this conclusion is supported by morphology and three lines of independent analysis of gene expression profiles from seven segments of the intestine. clustering analysis reveals a general similarity between s1-s <dig> and differences between s <dig> and s <dig> and the degree of similarity is measured by the degree of overlap in gene sets expressed in neighboring segments. second, we showed that well-known markers of the mammalian small and large intestine such as villin, fabp <dig>  and cof <dig> are differentially expressed along the anterior-posterior axis. finally by ontologies of genes expressed in the segments are consistent with small and large intestine function and confirmed by whole transcriptome comparisons with human and mouse small and large intestine gene sets. based on these findings, we suggest that the intestinal bulb, mid-intestine, and the anterior third of the caudal intestine corresponds to the small intestine of the mammalian gut while the remaining posterior portion of the caudal intestine corresponds to the large intestine terminating with the rectum.

in comparison with the mammalian intestine, the zebrafish intestine has a simple architecture with the intestinal lining folded into villar ridges rather than distinct finger-shaped villi of the mammalian small intestine. in cross section, a ridge appears identical to a villus and thus may be an evolutionary precursor to discrete villi. in support of this idea, an intermediate stage  in the morphogenesis of the chick intestine includes the initial formation of longitudinally oriented previllous ridges that buckle into a zig-zag pattern and eventually form villi in adult intestine. thus, in birds, ridges are embryological precursors to villi  <cit> .

in addition to the lack of well-defined villi, the zebrafish intestine lacks well-defined crypts, infoldings of the intestinal surface where stem cells and proliferating cells are located  <cit> . intestinal crypts are normally found at the base of the villus or lining the colon of the large intestine. in the zebrafish intestine, mitosis is restricted to the base of the villar ridges , suggesting that the crypts of lieberkuhn are specializations of the mammalian intestine. this arrangement also raises questions about the dynamics of epithelial renewal because cell proliferation in the intestine is balanced by apoptosis at the villus tips. location of apoptosis in the adult zebrafish intestine is rarely reported but we find most cell death occurs in the distal portion of the villar ridges and apoptosis is much more active when compared with mammalian intestines . in contrast, apoptosis in the embryonic and larval zebrafish intestine goes undetectable until morphogenesis has completed  <cit> , while apoptosis occurs throughout the development of the mouse duodenum  <cit>  but is reduced to a few cells per villus during adulthood  <cit> .

like many other fish including cyprinids and others  <cit> , the zebrafish has evolved into a stomachless fish  <cit> . the absence of a functional pepsinogen gene from the digestive tract is not unique to zebrafish but also occurrs in medaka fish  and other stomach-less fishes. interestingly, the expression of pepsinogen gene in another stomchless fish, the puffer fish , is restricted to its skin tissue, adopting different functions  <cit> . without a stomach, digestion and absorption must begin as early as possible in the limited length of the zebrafish digestive tract. ingested food is temporarily stored in the rostral intestinal bulb that bulges like an elastic sac, where food starts to be broken down in the absence of a stomach  <cit>  and the entire length of the intestine may serve to degrade food.

based on analysis in larval zebrafish and other cyprinids, previous reports raised that the posterior zebrafish intestine may be analogous to the mammalian colon  <cit> . this has also been proposed in a recent study based on histological data and molecular markers  <cit> . here our transcriptome data provide more solid evidence that this part of intestine in adult zebrafish resembles mammalian colon and rectum and moreover, segments s <dig> and s <dig> distinguish themselves from each other.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the entire intestine of adult zebrafish was systematically examined at the levels of anatomy, histology and transcriptome. despite the lack of crypts and evident structural distinction throughout most of the length of intestine, our genome-wide gene expression data have shown that the rostral, mid, and caudal portions of the zebrafish intestine have distinct functions analogous to the mammalian small and large intestine, respectively. organization of ridge structures represents a unique feature of zebrafish intestine, though they produce similar cross sections to mammalian intestines. evolutionary lack of stomach, crypts, paneth cells and submucosal glands has shaped the zebrafish intestine into a simpler but unique organ in vertebrate intestinal biology. this scenario may represent an evolutionary primitive feature of the digestive tract, where functional regionalization precedes morphological regionalization in a low vertebrate.
