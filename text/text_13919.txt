BACKGROUND
sympatric ecological speciation is a process by which a segment of a population develops some level of reproductive incompatibility with other population members in the absence of geographic barriers and complete cessation of gene flow  <cit> . today, advances in genomics  <cit>  and epigenetics  <cit>  have enabled testing of predictions generated by novel hypotheses on mechanisms underlying this evolutionary process. sympatric ecological speciation has been summarized into four main steps from an evolutionary genomics perspective: first, an initially panmictic population experiences a new environment; second, disruptive natural selection causes divergence of functional phenotypic traits and adaptive loci while gene flow at neutral loci continues; third, gene flow at neutral loci becomes partially restricted; and fourth, complete reproductive isolation and speciation  <cit> . the first stage involves character release where individuals of a species are exposed to new ecological opportunities  <cit> . this character release stage typically shows high levels of within-group phenotypic variance where phenotypic responses to the environment may be mainly epigenetic . the second stage describes how ecological opportunity can give rise to resource polymorphism where functional traits may become genetically accommodated, or hard-wired in the genome . in the third stage, given a degree of environmental stability, ecologically and phenotypically divergent intraspecific forms, or ecotypes, with partially restricted gene flow may arise. in the fourth and final stage, reproductive isolation evolves among morphs leading to speciation. at each stage, a collapse into panmixis can occur when divergent selection is relaxed  <cit> . this relaxation can be brought about by environmental change in which a heterogeneous environment  or diverse food sources are homogenized, as darwin’s finches experienced after seed type homogenization  <cit> . alternatively, changes in species abundance resulting from local extirpations or release from predation pressure or both  could also lead to relaxed divergent selection. additionally, hybridization of weakly diverged conspecifics can result in high within-group phenotypic variability  <cit> . therefore, although the stage of speciation may be assessed, the direction of evolutionary change cannot be discerned unless time-series data are available to assess directionality of selection and divergence.

understanding whether gene flow is partially restricted along an ecological gradient can provide evidence of the prime drivers of selective divergence and maintenance of ecotypes . thus, studies of niche divergence along environmental gradients can be important to species conservation and understanding of the interaction between human-mediated disturbance and evolution of wild populations. in most aquatic environments, water depth is an especially important gradient that correlates with many environmental variables . phenotypic and reproductive divergence along water depth gradients has been described in lake victoria cichlids  <cit>  and coregonids in europe and north america . thus, studies that compare neutral genetic and phenotypic divergence, pst , can help ascertain the relative influence of selection on genes and random genetic drift on population differentiation  <cit> . pst and neutral genetic divergence  can be compared among and within groups to assess the stage of ecological speciation. theoretically, if pst is greater than fst, then the phenotypic trait in question is interpreted to exceed levels of divergence based on neutral expectations, and is therefore under selection  <cit> .

here, we focus on neutral genetic and phenotypic variation in lake trout salvelinus namaycush, a species believed to have developed partially reproductively isolated ecotypes in sympatry . differentiation among lake trout ecotypes has been associated primarily with differences in traits related to trophic resource partitioning  and locomotion  . in lake superior, four ecotypes have been described: lean, humper, siscowet, and redfin  <cit> . the lean ecotype is considered the ancestral form, in part because it is the most widely distributed across north america  <cit> . relative to other ecotypes, lean lake trout typically use relatively shallow water  and have adaptations for sustained swimming similar to that required in fluvial environments. siscowet are the most abundant ecotype  <cit> , typically occupy deep water , and have much higher fat content than leans. historically, lean and siscowet would have fed differentially on a suite of cisco species . since the introduction of non-native forage fishes and shifts in the native forage base in lake superior, adult lean and siscowet lake trout now prey on similar shallow water diet items, but in differing proportions  <cit> . humper lake trout live on isolated offshore reefs  or on steep sloping banks surrounded by deep water  <cit> , and are intermediate in fat content between lean and siscowet lake trout  <cit> . the diet of humpers has not been described in detail; however, a humper-like ecotype from lake mistassini, quebec had a diet rich in pelagic opossum shrimp mysis relicta  <cit> , which are abundant in lake superior. the redfin only recently has been described as a distinct ecotype in lake superior and is the largest bodied of the ecotypes  <cit> . little is known about the diet of redfins, but they occupy deep water  and likely have diets similar to that of siscowet.

our main objectives were two-fold: 1) determine if contemporary lake trout genetic, morphological, and life history trait variation are divergent along a water depth gradient; and 2) determine the stage of ecological divergence  at which lake trout exist today in lake superior. to accomplish this, we directly compared genotype to phenotype, assessed gene flow, and quantified divergence of phenotypic traits of lake trout among water depth strata. historically, water depth was considered a primary axis for lake trout ecotype divergence . this hypothesis was supported by breeding experiments on physiological traits related to maintaining their position in the water column and capability to move among depths , and associations of ecotypes with depth of capture  <cit> . due to the recently documented overlap in morphology  <cit>  and genetic diversity  <cit>  among putative ecotypes, lake trout may have collapsed into a single gene pool and ecological axes of divergence for lake trout may have diminished. if phenotypic variation is divergent along an axis in which gene flow is partially restricted, then we confirm the persistence of ecological opportunities that can maintain or promote divergence. such information will be relevant for documenting intraspecific biodiversity  <cit>  in the largest freshwater lake in the world, and for the re-establishment in other laurentian great lakes of a native fish that has lost considerable genetic diversity due to human disturbance  <cit> .

methods
sampling
lake trout were sampled at isle royale, lake superior  during august  <dig> and  <dig>  by muir et al.  <cit> . gillnet sampling was conducted at  <dig> sites across three geographic zones around isle royale: zone  <dig>  northwest tip of the island; zone  <dig>  central part of east side of the island; zone  <dig>  southern tip of the island. gillnet sets  were distributed equally across three depth strata: shallow , intermediate , and deep   <cit> . siscowet were the most abundant ecotype sampled and identified by muir et al.  <cit>  , then lean , humper , and redfin . considering the relative abundance of lake trout within each water depth stratum, leans were the most abundant ecotype in shallow water , and only comprised  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of lake trout caught in intermediate and deep water, respectively. siscowet dominated intermediate  and deep water depths , with  <dig>  %  in <50 m shallow water. humper and redfin, caught mainly in >80 m of water, were less abundant than lean and siscowet within each depth strata . all four ecotypes were present in similar proportions in all three geographic zones: siscowet , leans , humpers , and redfins .fig.  <dig> map of study area. lake trout sampling sites  at three geographic zones around isle royale, lake superior. sampling year at each zone is indicated. this figure has been modified with permission from muir et al.  <cit> 




morphological measurements
to identify four lake trout ecotypes, variation in head and body shape was quantified by muir et al.  <cit>  using geometric morphometric methods  <cit>  on whole body digital images, as implemented in the thin plate spline suite : lean, humper, siscowet, and redfin . eight landmarks  and  <dig> semi-landmarks  defined head shape, and  <dig> semi- and  <dig> homologous landmarks defined body shape for  <dig> adult fish . landmark data were used to obtain size-adjusted partial warp scores for each fish for head and body shape in two separate analyses  <cit> . principal components analysis  was used to reduce dimensionality of warp scores to four principal components  for head and body data sets  <cit> . subsequently, pcs were used by muir et al.  <cit>  to identify morphological groups using a bayesian clustering package implemented in r . the first four pcs in an ordination of body shape accounted for 66 % of the variation and the first four pcs in an ordination of head shape accounted for 72 % of the variation  <cit> . pcs beyond four only increased the amount of explained variation by less than 5 % each and did not add any additional discriminatory power to the mclust models, therefore, on the basis of parsimony were omitted from the analysis. morphological groups were then identified by a combination of statistical and visual methods to achieve a consensus identification for each individual  <cit> .fig.  <dig> illustrations of four lake trout ecomorphs from isle royale, lake superior. photographs of lean , humper , siscowet  and redfin  are shown. the vertical lines provide a sense for relative sizes and positions of key anatomical features, such as head size and fin insertion and lengths among the ecomorphs. note that the four fish have been size-scaled to the same focal length




additionally, linear measurements for eight putatively functional traits linked to feeding and locomotion measured by muir et al.  <cit>  were used in this study to examine signatures of phenotypic selection across habitats: caudal peduncle depth , caudal peduncle length , head length , maxilla length , orbital length , pectoral fin length , pelvic fin length , and pre-orbital length  . buoyancy was measured as an adaptive trait, because it is positively correlated with body lipid content and capture depth  <cit> . as previously described in muir et al.  <cit> , percent buoyancy was calculated as the difference of the weight-of-fish-measured-in-air minus the weight-of-fish-measured-in-water, divided by weight-of-fish-measured-in-air times  <dig>  <cit> . linear and buoyancy measurements for each fish were log <dig> transformed and then regressed against standard length . the studentized residuals were used as size-adjusted variables in subsequent analyses.

life history trait estimation
five life history traits were calculated in a concurrent study by hansen et al.  <cit>  on the same lake trout samples represented in this study. annuli from transverse thin sections of dried sagittal otoliths were counted to estimate the age for each specimen. nonlinear mixed-effects models were used to estimate growth parameters for individual fish, based on biological intercept back-calculations of growth histories of individual fish  <cit> : age-at-time-zero ; length-at-time-zero ; instantaneous growth rate  at which fish length approaches the theoretical maximum length , herein referred to as asymptotic length; early annual growth rate . the lake trout specific biological intercept was based on equations describing relationships between length, age in days, and sagittal otolith width of age- <dig> estimated by bronte et al.  <cit>  where age- <dig> lake trout sagittal otolith radius =  <dig>  mm and length =  <dig>  mm  <cit> . detailed methods for these life history analyses are given by hansen et al.  <cit> .

dna extraction and microsatellite amplification
total genomic dna was extracted using a glass-milk binding protocol  <cit> . eighteen microsatellite loci were genotyped using a variety of previously published primer combinations . polymerase chain reactions  were conducted using  <dig>  μl of 10x thermopol reaction buffer, 200 μmol/l of dntps,  <dig> pmol of the forward and reverse primer,  <dig>  units of taq dna polymerase, and 1 μl of dna in 5 μl volumes. pcr conditions consisted of 95 °c for 5 min, 25– <dig> cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, locus specific annealing temperature  for 30 s, 72 °c for 1 min, and 72 °c for 3 min. amplicons were visualized on li-cor biosciences  dna analyzers with 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gels. scoring was performed by hand using a standard ladder  and scores verified using two positive controls on every gel.

statistical analyses
sources of genetic structure
three potential sources of group structure were recorded for each fish: morphology , geographic location around isle royale , and water depth stratum. total genetic variation was partitioned with a hierarchical analysis of molecular variance  based on  <dig>  permutations in arlequin. several amovas were performed to determine the variable that most strongly explained genetic organization among groups using the fct statistic for main effects of ecotype, zone, and water depth stratum, as well as all two-way combinations of those variables.

genetic diversity
microchecker  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  assessed scoring errors and the presence of null alleles. create  <dig>   <cit>  converted file formats from our original raw data file. hardy weinberg equilibrium  and linkage disequilibrium were tested using arlequin  <dig>   <cit> . all multi-test adjustments [e.g., hw, linkage disequilibrium) were based on a sequential goodness of fit metatest using the program r  <cit>  package ‘sgof’  <dig>   <cit> , except where stated otherwise. fstat  <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  and arlequin measured the number of alleles , allelic richness , the number of private alleles, and observed and expected heterozygosity . private allelic richness , the number of private alleles standardized by sample size for each group, was calculated in hp-rare  <cit> , inbreeding coefficients, fis  <cit> , were calculated using fstat, and significance of fis departure from hw was tested using  <dig>  permutations at α =  <dig> .

genetic structure within and among groups
principal coordinates analysis  in genalex  <dig>   <cit>  was used to visualize genotypic distribution of individual fish in multivariate space. several bayesian clustering analyses with the admixture model with a priori assumptions based on ecotype, zone, and water depth stratum in structure  <dig> . <dig>  determined the number of genetic groups, k. for each analysis,  <dig> independent runs were conducted for each value of k from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig> with burn-in length of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  followed by  <dig>  ×  <dig> randomization step. both the evanno et al.  <cit>  and pritchard et al.  <cit>  methods, as well as an estimation of when posterior probabilities for k plotted against k reached a plateau  <cit> , estimated the most probable k from the structure results. delta k  and the estimated natural log probability of k )  <cit>  were generated in structure harvester web  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . as an indicator of differentiation among groups,  <dig>  permutations in arlequin compared pairwise fst  <cit> . ‘demetics’  <dig> – <dig>  <cit>  package was implemented in r to obtain jost d  <cit>  and its significance values   <cit>  using  <dig>  bootstrap re-samplings. the bonferroni correction for jost d was performed using ‘demetics’  <cit> . mantel tests assessed correlations of genotype with water depth strata and geographic distance, as implemented in genalex with  <dig> permutations at an alpha level of p < <dig>  for significance tests. note that the original study design involved fish sampled at three water depth strata . more than three points  are required to perform a mantel test in genalex. thus, for this analysis only, the dataset was further subdivided into six water depths  based on maximum capture depth of net sets of individual fish. these depth categories while uneven  was estimated using the maximum-likelihood approach in migrate  <dig>   <cit> . migrate analyses were performed assuming an infinite allele model  and the parameters that follow:  <dig> short chains with a sampling increment of  <dig> where  <dig> genealogies are sampled; three long chains with a sampling increment of  <dig> where  <dig> genealogies are sampled. we discarded  <dig>  genealogies at the beginning of each chain as burn-in, and averaged maximum-likelihood estimates over five independent runs.

phenotypic trait variation among groups
to assess clinal relationships in morphological and life history traits, data was plotted graphically with their standard deviations. one-way anova was performed for each trait by the appropriate independent grouping variable, e.g., water depth, and pairwise post hoc fisher’s least significant difference  tests were conducted using spss  <dig>  .

genetic associations with phenotypic trait variation
phenotypic variance  estimates on morphological and life history traits among the three original water depth strata were compared to fst  <cit>  estimates. pst is a distance matrix analogue to fst  <cit> . phenotype-environment associations are assumed to evolve under divergent natural selection, while dna sequences such as microsatellite loci evolve neutrally  <cit> , have an additive genetic basis , and presumably are under stabilizing selection  <cit> . on the other hand, divergent or directional selection of a phenotypic trait is implied when pst is greater or less than fst.

among-  and within-group  phenotypic variance was estimated for morphological traits by calculating genetic relationship matrices  in program rmet  <dig>  . phenotypic distances were adjusted for sample size in rmet, and we used a heritability score of  <dig>  as recommended by leinonen et al.  <cit> . the program output contains an r-matrix , a d
2-matrix , and a global pst-value . for pairwise comparisons of phenotypic to genetic distances among different water depth strata, we used the d
 <dig> estimates  because no heritability estimation was required. fst for microsatellite markers was calculated with bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals using the ‘diversity’  <cit>  package in program r  <cit> . subsequently, and for direct comparison with pst-values, the upper and lower confidence limits around fst were converted to standard error  using the following equation: se = / <dig> . if within-group phenotypic traits showed greater variance at intermediate water depths, hybridization was considered as an explanation  <cit> . on the other hand, if variance increased with an increase in water depth, it was interpreted as divergent selection and character release in early stages of sympatric divergence  <cit> .

RESULTS
sources of genetic structure
among ecotype, zone, and depth stratum, only depth stratum explained  molecular variance among groups . ecotype, zone, or any combination of these variables with each other and with depth stratum did not reveal any significant genetic structuring. overall, the highest levels of among group genetic variation was attributable to depth stratum.table  <dig> analyses of molecular variance  for isle royale lake trout

because depth stratum was the strongest variable associated with group genetic structure according to amova, subsequent genetic analyses were performed with fish samples grouped by water depth, and not by ecotype or zone, except where stated otherwise. also, zone  <dig> was excluded from analyses due to the interaction between zone and depth stratum, except where stated otherwise.

genetic diversity
most loci  showed moderate levels of variation with the number of alleles ranging from three to  <dig> and averaging  <dig>  . possible null alleles were detected in one, sfo <dig>  of  <dig> loci consistently across ecotypes and depth strata according to microchecker. after sequential goodness of fit correction  <cit> ,  <dig> pairs  of loci had significant linkage disequilibrium. for analyses dependent on assumptions of hw and informative loci  the locus sfo <dig> was excluded due to null alleles, and sald <dig> and oneu <dig> were excluded due to low he. no fis estimates deviated significantly from hw when the dataset was divided by water depth strata , zone, or ecotype . similarly, he and ar did not differ  among depth strata. lake trout within the intermediate depth stratum  had the lowest par of the three strata, possibly indicating gene flow from shallow and deep strata to the intermediate depth stratum .table  <dig> the number of lake trout sampled and genetic diversity across water depth strata

genetic structure within and among groups
individual lake trout genotypes showed a lack of clustering in pcoa, and principal coordinate axis  <dig>  and  <dig>  had little explanatory power  . similar to pcoa, bayesian clustering in structure could not distinguish among ecotype, zone, or depth stratum . however, bayesian analyses using ‘zone’ and ‘depth stratum’ priors revealed the interaction between zone and depth . individuals captured in the intermediate depth stratum in zone  <dig> , may be weakly genetically differentiated from all other fish sampled around isle royale. however, the group structure was not robust enough for q-values  to assign individuals to more than one inferred clusters . all jost d pairwise comparisons among depths were significant . genetic differentiation estimates for both fst and jost d were largest between the shallow and deep strata, consistent with the hypothesis of a genetic cline with depth.table  <dig> genetic differentiation among lake trout at three water depth strata

relationship between morphology and genotype
six morphological and life history trait divergence estimates  among depth strata were significantly higher than corresponding microsatellite-based neutral genetic divergence estimates fst-values: asymptotic length, buoyancy, body and head shape, early growth rate, and pelvic fin length . because heritability was set to  <dig> , our pst estimates were conservative and prone to false negatives . thus, caudal peduncle length and depth, age at length zero, and maxilla length may also be traits that exceed neutral expectations. if the difference between pst-fst values increases with increasing water depth, it may mean that divergent selection increases with water depth, i.e., phenotype becomes more specialized with water depth. therefore, we conducted paired comparisons of mahanalobis phenotypic distances, d
2-values, for buoyancy and caudal peduncle depth increased between depth strata, yet d

discussion
despite concern raised from recently documented overlap in morphological  <cit>  and genetic diversity  <cit>  among putative lake trout ecotypes, our results confirmed water depth as an ecological axis of divergence at isle royale, lake superior that can maintain or promote lake trout diversity. evidence presented herein supports the hypothesis of genetic and phenotypic divergence along a water depth axis, in which gene flow was partially restricted. this pattern of gene flow suggests that lake trout were not in a state of panmixis. however, high gene flow and lack of strong genetic discontinuities among ecotypes suggest that lake trout genetic diversity, as represented by our collections, was organised along a continuum, rather than among discrete ecotypes, as was historically reported  <cit> . the exact number of discrete ecotypes at isle royale either may be underestimated or possibly cannot be determined using conventional methods. therefore, we believe the level of lake trout differentiation may have been disrupted from the past and may now have been reset to an early stage of ecotype formation. reduced diversity may render contemporary lake trout more sensitive to environmental perturbations. below, we discuss how adaptive differentiation in lake trout ecotypes currently exists along an ecological gradient, their presumed stage of divergence along an ecological speciation continuum, and implications of our findings for species conservation and adaptive diversity in lake trout.

water depth as a driver of genetic and phenotypic differentiation
our findings supported the hypothesis that lake trout genetic and phenotypic variation are divergent along a water depth gradient at isle royale, lake superior. despite a lack of significant genetic structure among ecotypes, a consistent pattern in genetic variation among depth strata suggests restricted gene flow by water depth, rather than by ecotype or by geography. based on our results, water depth appears to be a strong ecological axis of divergence important to maintenance of organization of lake trout genetic and morphological diversity. vertical distribution of spawning depth often explains neutral genetic group structure . unfortunately, little is known about lake trout spawning areas below 30 m due to logistical difficulties of sampling at great depths  <cit>  , and during inclement weather of late autumn. lake trout are thought to spawn at depths from  <dig> to at least 80 m  <cit> , yet most documented egg observations have been at depths <20 m  <cit> . variation in local adaptation to water depth we observed, likely depends on selective mechanisms  on adaptive genes; but also on trait plasticity due to gene expression  <cit> , often tied closely to the environment during development  <cit> . therefore, depth at which eggs are spawned and larvae are reared probably influences genetic variation and phenotypic expression in lake trout.

size-corrected morphological traits, buoyancy, body shape, and pelvic fin length, diverged along the depth axis and appeared to exceed neutral expectations. these traits are likely tied to overall fitness of lake trout and their ability to distribute themselves vertically in the water column. increased lipid metabolism leading to higher buoyancy is important in deep, cold, dense waters to behaviorally thermoregulate body temperature, and to maintain or change position in the water column  <cit> . large pelvic fins function to stabilize body position, and may have a fitness advantage in shallow water considering variable water current speeds, tributary outflows, and periodic storm events  <cit> . a deep caudal peduncle is critical to life in shallow and fluvial waters, especially for ecotypes that predate on fast moving prey . because the pst-fst method  cannot distinguish between variation from epigenetic-based plasticity and directional selection on genes, the mechanistic basis of lake trout trait evolution remains unclear  <cit> . evidence for a degree of genetic accommodation, or hard-wiring, of lipid metabolism has been previously reported . on the other hand, buoyancy, body shape, and lipid metabolism are more responsive to environmental stimuli than cranioskeletal traits  <cit> . buoyancy in isle royale lake trout varied more widely with depth than any other trait we measured, perhaps indicating a higher degree of environmental responsiveness relative to other traits. although pelvic fin length decreased from shallow to deep strata, measurements were similar between the two shallowest strata. consequently, pelvic fin length decreased from shallow to deep water for all ecotypes, except for leans . possibly, pelvic fin length may be under stronger selection in leans than deep water ecotypes, which show higher levels of plasticity related to pelvic fin length than leans.

of the life history traits studied here, early growth rate and asymptotic length decreased significantly from shallow to deep strata. these differences in growth and length may be associated with limiting factors related to cold  and deep  environments. deep water lake trout tend to mature at smaller sizes and grow slower than shallow water ecotypes  <cit> . in flathead lake, montana, lake trout life history traits diverged between lake trout caught from shallow and deep depths after the introduction of mysis diluviana  <cit> ; a fatty crustacean that lives mainly below the thermocline  <cit> . therefore, the ultimate cause of adaptations to deep water were resource partitioning, while the proximate cause was a shift in spawning and rearing depth that followed the diet shift. the difference between shallow and deep water lake superior lake trout life history traits, rather than a gradual cline, could possibly imply a spawning or nursery depth threshold , beyond which environmental variables  affect eggs and growing larvae differentially .

variation in lake trout craniofacial traits  at isle royale did not exceed expectations based on the variation at neutral loci, and phenotypic variance was low within  and among water depth strata . we expected isle royale lake trout craniofacial features to vary with depth due to presumably different prey assemblages at different depths  <cit> . alternatively, apparent neutral evolution of craniofacial traits may suggest stabilizing selection, wherein intermediate variants are favoured among depths, genetic diversity decreases, and the group mean stabilizes on a particular trait. our results are consistent with studies of arctic charr salvelinus alpinus, where cranioskeletal genes were expressed differentially when exposed to different food types and were less diverse, and craniofacial traits were less responsive to novel environments than those associated with lipid levels and body shape  <cit> ). however, phenotypic variance in head shape as a whole did exceed neutral expectations when compared to neutral expectations based on genetic divergence in microsatellite loci . thus, perhaps prey- or water depth-based selection or phenotypic plasticity has occurred or is still occurring to a degree. nonetheless, head shape varied less than body shape at isle royale. by contrast, at great bear lake , head shape varied more than body shape among piscivorous and invertivorous lake trout ecotypes collected from shallow water <30 m  <cit> . clearly, lake trout organization is influenced by water depth at isle royale. perhaps the apparent fixation of individual linear craniofacial traits  in isle royale lake trout reflect a strong prey resource gradient that originally existed in the lake, and potentially may reduce ability to adapt to exotic introductions or fish community changes  <cit> .

our results suggest that hard-wiring at adaptive genes in the presence of high gene flow occurred differentially among traits . similarly, genetically differentiated intraspecific groups vary in the relative proportions of genetic correlations with different traits in three-spine stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus , whitefish , rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss  <cit> , brown trout salmo trutta  <cit> , and arctic charr salvelinus alpinus  <cit> . each trait likely has a different balance of genetic control and environmental responsiveness that varies among lakes, depending on respective selective pressures and their duration and intensity over generations  <cit> ; also see  <cit> .

stage of ecological speciation in lake superior lake trout
consistent with a species at an early stage of speciation, we found that four visually distinct lake trout ecotypes could not be distinguished from each other genetically using various population genetic methods for neutral genetic variation. pcoa and bayesian clustering results on neutral microsatellite loci implied a single panmictic lake trout population . however, we found evidence for weak genetic isolation in the form of partially restricted gene flow associated with increasing depth of capture. increasing phenotypic variation with depth possibly indicated diversifying selection on adaptive genes. therefore, lake trout ecotypes are likely at an early evolutionary stage characterized by disruptive natural selection on functional phenotypic traits and high gene flow  deep cold water lakes  <cit> . sufficient generations have passed since the last glacial maximum in the presence of ecological niche diversification  to allow parallel development of resource polymorphism in this species in several lakes across north america . in lake superior, however, gene flow seems high among ecotypes and appears to have increased in recent decades , which may have impeded or reversed the historical trajectory of ecological speciation  <cit> . although our findings imply that the predominant direction of historical gene flow was from shallow to deep water, evidence of bi-directional gene flow is consistent with phenotypic mixing between the two shallowest depth strata. considering that low gene flow is expected in the later stages of ecological speciation, lake trout are not likely experiencing strong forward speciation  in lake superior  <cit> .

implications for species conservation and adaptive diversity in lake trout
lake trout fisheries have targeted the shallow water lean ecotype, whereas humper, siscowet, and redfin typically located farther offshore were fished less. intensive stocking after the lake trout fishery collapse of the 1950s focussed solely on re-introductions of the lean ecotype during the 1960s through 1990s  <cit> . likewise, invasive sea lamprey predation is thought to have had the most impact in shallow water strata . the selective fishery and sea lamprey predation may have disproportionately elevated mortality of leans, thereby enhancing fitness of deep water ecotypes and altering the fitness landscape in the lake  <cit> . ecological divergence is thought to accelerate when two or more ecological gradients coincide  <cit> . if lake trout populations were historically divergent on multiple niche axes  and in modern times the number of niche axes has been reduced , then speciation possibly has been impeded, reversed, or reset back to an earlier stage of diversification  <cit> . at present, whether lake trout diversity in lake superior is in the process of collapsing, expanding, or in a stable gene flow-diversification balance cannot be determined. however, based on available information about lake superior lake trout, a depth gradient persists and remains evolutionarily important, and ecotypes have at least a partial genetic basis for divergence .

lake trout reproductive boundaries are not completely isolated in lake superior, and their evolutionary potential may be especially vulnerable to future changing environmental conditions, and to expansions and reductions in ecological opportunity. lake trout of lake superior appear to have collapsed genetically and morphologically, concurrent with dramatic overall depletions in allelic richness since the 1940s  <cit> . to discern the processes potentially underlying these losses , changes in the selective environment, the nature of gene flow between wild populations and hatchery strains, and adaptive genetic diversity must be better understood. future genetic analyses of historical collections of lake trout scale samples dating back to before the fishery collapse could shed light on temporal trends in genetic structure and ecological diversity. such research could permit identification of genetic predictors of human impacts on evolutionary processes in wild populations.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence of reductions in gene flow and divergent natural selection associated with water depth in lake superior. these patterns in genetic variation among depth strata persist despite a lack of significant genetic structure when the data set is divided by ecotype. thus, water depth appears to be a strong ecological axis of divergence important to the maintenance of organization of lake trout genetic and morphological diversity. lake superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world, and lake trout have recently lost considerable genetic diversity  <cit> . therefore, the results represented in this study are relevant for documenting intraspecific biodiversity for this species. however, it is still unclear as to whether the observed patterns are a result of an early stage of incipient speciation, gene flow-selection equilibrium, or reverse speciation causing formerly divergent ecotypes to collapse into a single gene pool.
