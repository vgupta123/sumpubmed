BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes mature rna is formed by the removal of introns from a primary transcript. splicing is catalyzed by a multicomponent complex, the spliceosome  <cit> . two intron classes have been identified, a common u2-type and a rare u12-type  <cit> . splicing of u2-type introns is catalyzed by the u2-dependent  spliceosome, which includes the u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> spliceosomal rnas as well as multiple protein factors. the u12-dependent  spliceosome, responsible for the excision of the u12-type introns, is structurally similar to the u2-type spliceosome. it contains protein subunits and the u <dig> rna as well as the u <dig>  u <dig>  u4atac, and u6atac spliceosomal rnas that are functionally and structurally related to the u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> rnas of the major spliceosome.

u <dig> introns have characteristic properties at the 5' splice site , 3' splice site  and branch site . there is also a pyrimidine rich region between the branch and 3' splice sites. much of the specificity in the splicing reaction is accomplished by pairing with snrnas. thus, the 5' splice site pairs with u <dig> rna and the branch site pairs with u <dig> rna.

the u <dig> introns have consensus sequences that are different from u <dig> introns. the 5' splice site  as well branch site  are more conserved than their counterparts in u <dig> introns, whereas the 3' splice site is more variable. in addition, u <dig> introns lack a pyrimidine rich region. whereas the vast majority of u <dig> introns have the dinucleotides gt and ag at their 5' and 3' ends, respectively, some u <dig> introns have the dinucleotides at and ac in these positions  <cit> . during u <dig> splicing, the 5' splice site and branch site pair with the u <dig> and u <dig> snrna, respectively.

u2-type introns are ubiquitous in eukaryotes while u12-type introns are lacking in some species, such as saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  and in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . u <dig> introns were first reported only in vertebrates, insects, cnidarians and plants  <cit> . however, they were later discovered in rhizopus oryzae, phytophthora and acantamoeba castellanii, demonstrating an early evolutionary origin for the u <dig> spliceosome  <cit> .

we have recently presented an inventory of spliceosomal rnas based on computational prediction from genomic sequences  <cit> . we found additional support of u <dig> splicing in acanthamoeba castellanii as we identified the u12-type spliceosomal u <dig> and u6atac rnas, in addition to the previously identified u <dig> rna  <cit> . furthermore, rnas specific to the u <dig> spliceosome were identified in a number of phylogenetic groups where previously such rnas were not observed, including the nematode trichinella spiralis, the slime mold physarum polycephalum and the fungal lineages zygomycota and chytridiomycota. the detailed map of the distribution of the u12-type rna genes supports an early origin of the minor spliceosome and points to a number of occasions during evolution where it was lost.

we have now addressed the question of whether the distribution of u12-type rnas is correlated with the distribution of u <dig> introns. if there is such a correlation we also wanted to examine mechanisms of u <dig> intron evolution. possible events regarding the fate of u <dig> introns as discussed by burge et al  <cit>  include u <dig> intron loss as well as conversion of introns from the u <dig> to the u <dig> category by mutational changes. the database of orthologous u <dig> introns, u12db <cit> , lists examples of changes in the latter category.

a number of methods have been developed for the prediction of u <dig> type introns  <cit> . most of them make use of weight matrices based on known exon-intron boundary regions and branch sites  <cit> . in addition, at-ac-type introns with classic consensus features may be identified with a simple pattern-based approach  <cit> .

for this study we have used the methods of burge et al  <cit>  as well as that of sheth et al  <cit>  to predict u <dig> and u <dig> introns in a number of different species that represent a broad phylogenetic range. the results show that the distribution of u <dig> introns is consistent with the distribution of u <dig> spliceosomal components.

methods
sequence data
est sequences were retrieved using ncbi entrez. genomic sequences were downloaded from wustl http://genome.wustl.edu, t. spiralis version  <dig> , and physarum polycephalum version  <dig> ), wormbase , jgi , from broad institute , from tigr  and from tracedb .

identification of u <dig> introns
introns were identifying from blast searches  <cit>  where est sequences were used to query a database of genomic sequences. for instance, in the case of t. spiralis, a total of  <dig>  est sequences were retrieved using ncbi entrez and used to query a database of t. spiralis genome sequences. the genome sequences contained  <dig> contigs with a total of  <dig> , <dig> nt. only hits with sequence identity at least 98% and hsp length at least  <dig> nt were considered for further analysis.

whenever an est matched to more than one genomic contig sequence we selected for further analysis the contig with the most extensive match to the est sequence. as blast is often not able to unambiguously identify the exact location of the splice site, we considered all possible sites and the most probable one was identified by screening with position weight matrices  as described below.

pwms for 5', 3' and branch sites of the gt-ag u <dig>  gt-ag u <dig>  at-ac u <dig> and gc-ag u <dig> type of introns from five different species were obtained from the splicerack database http://katahdin.cshl.edu:9331/splicerack/index.cgi?database=splicenew. for the 5' splice sites the pwm covers  <dig> positions where the first  <dig> positions are the 3' end of the exon, and for the 3' splice site the window has  <dig> positions when the last  <dig> positions are in the exon part. the branch site pwm has a length of  <dig> and corresponds to a location falling into the range of  upstream of the 3' splice site of the intron. pwms were available for c. elegans, d. melanogaster, a. thaliana, h. sapiens and m. musculus but only the first three of these were used for the scoring of t. spiralis sequences as these pwms are more appropriate to nematodes as well as to the other species examined here  <cit> .

we used 5' and 3' matrices from c. elegans, d. melanogaster and a. thaliana to score all possible intron locations as inferred by blast. each possible position of the intron therefore generated three different sets of 5' and 3' scores. we finally selected the intron position where both 5' and 3' scores were the greatest or, in cases where this was not applicable, where the sum of both scores was the greatest.

for identification of u <dig> introns using the method of sheth et al  <cit> , pseudocounts of  <dig>  were added to the pwms available from the splicerack database http://katahdin.cshl.edu:9331/splicerack/ and log-odd matrices were then obtained. in the case of the branch site scoring we used only one pwm, as the pwms of the five different species were identical. for identifying the most likely branch site every segment of length  <dig> within the range  relative to the 3' splice site was scored with u <dig> gt-ag and at-ac matrices.

for prediction of u <dig> introns using the burge et al method  <cit>  we used for scoring the frequency matrices of u <dig> gt-ag, u <dig> gt-ag, and u <dig> at-ac dependent introns from splicerack. as there is no matrix for branch sites of gt-ag u <dig> introns we created such a matrix in the following way. for every u <dig> intron of t. spiralis classified with the method from sheth et al. we used the branch site which achieved the best score with a gt-ag u <dig> pwm. all the  <dig> branch sites obtained in this way were used to construct a frequency matrix.

the scores for each splice or branch site were then computed as described in burge et al.  <cit> . the 5' splice site probability is defined as  where the probability of base j in position i is , u is either u <dig> or u <dig> and x describes the sequence to be scored. to score the branch site, the values of  and  are calculated for each  <dig> nt segment in the range  relative to the 3' splice site and the maximum values of both calculations were retained. the complete 5' splice site scores and branch site scores are  and , respectively. these two values were calculated for every intron found. the corresponding sample mean and standard deviation were determined and these scores were normalized to z scores s5'ss and sbps by subtracting the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

after scoring all introns we tried to separate the putative u <dig> dependent introns from the u <dig> dependent ones with respect to their normalized scores. the lower thresholds for u <dig> type introns were empirically defined with respect to the minimum values of a reference set of minor introns which were used by burge et al  <cit> . the test criterion we used was the same as in zhu and brendel  <cit> , and as discussed by these authors it is likely to be different from the test statistic  originally used by burge et al.

we also analyzed all predicted introns with respect to previously known consensus features of u <dig> introns as referred to by russell et al  <cit> . in addition, we took into consideration that for effective splicing at the 5' splice site we require the sequence rtatcctt where one of the cs in positions + <dig> and + <dig> may be replaced by a t .

analysis of relationship between introns of c. elegans and t. spiralis
for identifying introns in c. elegans that are homologous to the u <dig> introns in t. spiralis the c. elegans genome sequence  was retrieved from wormbase ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/genomes/c_elegans/sequences/dna/.

a c. elegans protein database  with  <dig> proteins was also downloaded from wormbase ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/genomes/c_elegans/sequences/protein/.

blastx was first used to identify c. elegans proteins corresponding to the t. spiralis u <dig> intron genes. genomic positions of the corresponding gene in c. elegans were then inferred using tblastn.

RESULTS
we have previously examined the phylogenetic distribution of u <dig> and u <dig> spliceosomal components  <cit> . the results showed that u <dig> components were lacking in a number of phyla such as nematoda, choanoflagellida , fungi, mycetozoa, entamoeba, red and green algae and heterokonta. we have now examined the occurrence of u <dig> type introns in these groups.

identification of introns
introns were identified by matching of ests to genomic sequences using blast  <cit> . the size distribution of introns for selected species is shown in additional file  <dig>  mode values vary between  <dig> and  <dig> nt for all species examined here. an exception is c. reinhardtii, which has a distribution of introns lengths with a mode value which is approximately  <dig> nt, consistent with previous observations  <cit> .

in order to discriminate between u <dig> and u <dig> introns we used methods described by burge et al  <cit> , zhu and brendel  <cit>  and sheth et al  <cit>  as described under materials and methods. in the burge et al method weight matrices were used to score 5' splice sites and branch sites. normalized z scores for these sites were then obtained and used to produce plots like that shown in fig.  <dig> for p. sojae. in order to discriminate between u <dig> and u <dig> type introns we used a cutoff based on a reference set of u <dig> introns as used in burge et al  <cit> . thus, for an intron to qualify as a u <dig> type both 5' splice site and branch site scores need to be at least the minimum values present in the reference u <dig> set of sequences  <cit> . the plot in fig.  <dig> shows that in the case of p. sojae three different introns, one of the type gt-ag and two of the type at-ac, fulfilled these criteria.

u <dig> introns in trichinella spiralis
we examined in more detail the prediction of u12-type introns in the nematode t. spiralis. molecular phylogenetic analysis places trichinella close to the root in the nematode tree, i.e. more deeply branching than species such as c. elegans of the rhabditida branch  <cit>  which is believed to be lacking u <dig> introns.

in t. spiralis we identified a total of  <dig> introns. out of these,  <dig> were of type gt-ag,  <dig> were of type gc-ag and  <dig> were at-ac type introns. in addition,  <dig> introns were identified with non-canonical terminal dinucleotides.

using the method of sheth et al  <cit> , u <dig> gt-ag type introns  and u <dig> at-ac introns  were identified . minor introns are thought to have the 5' splice site sequence rtatcctt where one of the cs in positions + <dig> and + <dig> may be converted into a t . there are  <dig> introns that do not conform to this rule, leaving  <dig> introns that are stronger predictions.

table shows all introns identified by the sheth et al method  <cit> . regions with best match to branch site pwm is underlined. for one of the atac introns  is shown the shift in 5' splice site observed between t. spiralis and c. elegans. rule of 5' splice site  is that 5' splice site sequence is rtatcctt where one of the cs in positions + <dig> and + <dig> may be converted into a t. burge et al method  is described in  <cit> . na = not available. for sequences of u <dig> and u <dig> introns listed in table, see additional file  <dig> 

in order to study the fate of t. spiralis u <dig> introns we examined the homologous genes in c. elegans where u <dig> introns are believed to be absent. of the  <dig> est sequences that we identified using the sheth et al method as being associated with u <dig> type introns,  <dig> had no matches to entries in protein databases and could not be associated with a c. elegans gene. another  <dig> ests matched only partially to the homologous c. elegans gene and for this reason we were not able to examine the fate of the homologous t. spiralis intron. for the remaining ests we were able to compare the t. spiralis u <dig> intron to the corresponding c. elegans intron. four of these had identical splice sites in the two species as shown in table  <dig>  and in all these cases the t. spiralis introns were changed from u <dig> to u <dig> type in c. elegans.

for two of t. spiralis at-ac-type u <dig> introns the intron was completely lost in c. elegans . it is interesting to note that in the case of the third u <dig> at-ac intron, a shift from u <dig> to u <dig> is accomplished by a shift of splice site , such that the intron is moved a distance corresponding to three amino acids in the coding sequence. therefore, we here observe yet another mechanism whereby a u <dig> intron may be converted to a u <dig> type intron.

finally, we also used the method of burge et al  <cit>  to predict u <dig> type introns in t. spiralis. a smaller number of u <dig> type introns were found using this method;  <dig> at-ac and one gt-ag u <dig> intron . also for other species examined, the sheth et al method generated more u <dig> candidates as compared to the burge et al method.

u <dig> introns as predicted by requiring effective branch sites as well as 5' splice sites
in addition to trichinella spiralis, we examined the introns in the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis, in the zygomycota rhizopus oryzae and phycomyces blakesleeanus, in the basidiomycota phakopsora pachyrhizi, in acanthamoeba castellanii, entamoeba histolytica, physarum polycephalum, in the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and in the heterokonts phytophthora infestans, phytophthora sojae, thalassiosira pseudonana and phaeodactylum tricornutum . introns were predicted using the same methods as described above for t. spiralis introns.

table shows prediction according to methods of burge et al  and sheth et al   <cit> . the "5' rule" is that 5' splice site sequence is rtatcctt where one of the cs in positions + <dig> and + <dig> may be converted into a t. occurrence of u <dig> snrnas is from davila-lopez et al  <cit> . for sequences of u <dig> introns as predicted by the burge et al method, see additional file  <dig> 

previously, u <dig> introns have been reported in some of these species. thus, russell et al  <cit>  reported three at-ac and two gt-ag type introns in a. castellanii, one at-ac intron in r. oryzae and one at-ac intron in the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase genes of p.sojae and p. ramorum. it should be noted that russell et al used a pattern based approach to identify u <dig> type introns. this method is not expected to be as accurate as the prediction carried out here which is based on position weight matrices. two u <dig> introns were identified by glöckner et al  <cit>  in p. polycephalum, although it is not clear what method in that case was used to classify the introns.

in a. castellanii we identified three u <dig> introns . one of them is the at-ac u <dig> intron in the gene comm <dig> previously found by russell et al  <cit> . we also identified a gt-ag intron present in the gene for a mitochondrial carnitine acylcarnitine carrier protein. in addition, there is evidence of a gc-ag u <dig> intron, present in a gene encoding a lipid transfer protein.

a multiple alignment of all available a. castellanii u <dig> introns, i.e. those identified previously  <cit> , together with the two additional introns identified here, shows that there is a c-rich region in all these sequences downstream of the consensus 5' splice site sequence . we do not know if this sequence conservation is functionally significant, but it seems specific to a. castellanii, as it is not found in other species with u <dig> introns such as physarum.

in p. sojae we identified a previously reported at-ac intron which is present in a gene encoding peptidyl-prolyl isomerase  <cit> . in addition, one other at-ac as well as a gt-ag u <dig> intron in the ribosomal protein l <dig> gene is present in this species. in p. infestans we identified the introns homologous to the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and l <dig> introns in p. sojae, as well as an additional at-ac intron.

in r. oryzae we found the same at-ac intron previously reported  <cit> , as well as two additional gt-ag introns.

a very large number of u <dig> introns were predicted in p. polycephalum . at the same time, this collection does not include any of the introns reported by glockner et al  <cit> . perhaps u <dig> introns are particularly predominant in this species. as an alternative, our prediction method may give rise to an unusually large number of false positives in p. polycephalum. on the other hand, many of the u <dig> introns may be regarded as strong predictions as they also conform to the 5' consensus rule. it is therefore highly likely that u <dig> introns exist in this species.

in summary, the phylogenetic distribution of u <dig> introns is entirely consistent with the distribution of u <dig> snrnas  <cit> . this is illustrated in the schematic phylogenetic tree in fig.  <dig>  there are at least nine different branches that are associated with a loss of u <dig> splicing. when more genomic and est sequences become available even more instances of such loss may be observed.

when comparing the distribution of u <dig> snrnas and u <dig> introns one potential discrepancy is p. pachyrhizi where u <dig> introns seem to be missing but we have identified a u4atac snrna. however, no other u12-type snrna was found, and it would therefore seem likely that this species is missing u12-dependent splicing. the u4atac snrna observed could be a non-functional remnant of the u <dig> splicing machinery of an ancestral species.

there is also a weak candidate for a u <dig> at-ag intron in t. pseudonana  but as this is the only u <dig> intron predicted in this species and because we have failed to identify any u <dig> snrnas in this species the evidence of u <dig> splicing is so far very poor.

u <dig> introns in ribosomal protein genes
although u <dig> introns are very rare they occur in ribosomal protein genes in five of the species examined here, r. oryzae , p. blakesleeanus , p. sojae , p. infestans  and p. polycephalum .

in the zygomycota r. oryzae there are at least three non-identical versions of the s <dig> gene. these genes encode nearly identical proteins . one of the genes has no intron at all and the other two have u <dig> gt-ag introns towards the 3' end of the coding sequence. in p. blakesleeanus, another zygomycota, we have identified one s <dig> gene. this gene has a u <dig> intron in the same position as for the r. oryzae gene. more s <dig> genes might be found in this species once genome sequencing is complete.

by comparison the s <dig> gene in the basidiomycota p. pachyrizi has two different introns and neither of them are of the u <dig> type and in the same position as the r. oryzae s <dig> intron.

p. sojae, p. infestans and p. ramorum of the oomycetes group all have a l <dig> gene with a u <dig> gt-ag intron positioned towards the 5' end of the coding sequence. by comparison the l <dig> genes in the diatoms t. pseudonana and p. tricornutum seem to be missing introns.

the presence of u <dig> introns in ribosomal protein genes may be of significance from a regulatory point of view. ribosomal proteins have previously been reported to be involved in u <dig> splicing. thus, there is a u <dig> intron in the gene for ribosomal protein l <dig> in x. laevis  <cit> . this intron has a low efficiency in splicing, indicating that it might be involved in regulation of l <dig> expression. there is evidence that splicing of u <dig> introns is comparatively ineffective and is a rate-limiting step in gene expression  <cit> .

the presence of u <dig> introns in ribosomal protein genes may also be relevant to the observation that in the yeast s. cerevisiae, where introns are rare, ribosomal protein genes is a predominating class of genes containing introns  <cit> . the splicing of introns in s. cerevisiae ribosomal proteins is presumably of great regulatory significance  <cit> . for instance, there is an autoregulatory mechanism of l <dig> where the protein inhibits the splicing of its own pre-mrna  <cit> . there is also evidence that yeast ribosomal protein paralogues are different in terms of splicing regulation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of u <dig> and u <dig> introns have been examined in a number species that we previously screened for u <dig> and u <dig> spliceosomal rnas. in most species where u <dig> introns are found, such introns are very rare. the phylogenetic distribution of u <dig> introns is entirely consistent with the distribution of u <dig> spliceosomal rnas. the currently available information on u <dig> introns and u <dig> spliceosomal components presents strong evidence that u <dig> splicing is missing in a number of phyla and species; in the caenorhabditis branch, in monosiga, in microsporidia, in basidiomycota, ascomycota and pezizomycotina, in dictyostelium and entamoeba, in the red and green algae and in the diatoms t. pseudonana and p. tricornatum. this would correspond to at least nine different occasions during evolution where u <dig> splicing seem to have been lost .

we have examined in more detail the occurrence of introns in the nematodes t. spiralis and c. elegans. as these two species are relatively closely related by evolution they offer a unique possibility to monitor the process in which u <dig> splicing is lost. by comparing t. spiralis u <dig> introns to their homologues in c. elegans we noted that u <dig> introns were eliminated using different mechanisms. in some cases u <dig> introns were lost completely. other u <dig> introns were subject to extensive sequence changes including changes in the 5', 3', and branch site regions of the introns. in one case a u <dig> to u <dig> conversion was achieved by shifting the splice position only a short distance.
