BACKGROUND
in order to establish an infection, intracellular pathogens need to adapt to their new environment to survive the innate and adaptive immune responses of the host. a number of human pathogens - including leishmania sp., trypanosoma cruzi, mycobacterium tuberculosis, toxoplasma gondii, francisella tularensis, legionella pneumophila, and ehrlichia - have evolved mechanisms not only to evade the host immune system, but to infect the very immune cells that are recruited to clear an infection . leishmania is able to infect and to replicate within mammalian macrophages. it may serve as a model of intracellular infection of immune cells and can be used to study transcriptomic changes that take place in both the host and the pathogen over the course of an infection.

leishmania major and related species are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, a group of diseases that vary in severity from self-healing skin lesions to disfiguring mucosal manifestations to fatal visceral disease. more than a million new cases are reported annually, mostly concentrated in the middle east and central and south america  <cit> . the leishmania life cycle is divided between its insect vector, the phlebotomine sand fly, and its mammalian host, where it resides primarily inside of macrophages although neutrophils, dendritic cells, and fibroblasts have also been implicated at various stages of infection . previous studies have shown that the parasite undergoes changes in morphology and alterations in cell surface components as it adapts to the intracellular environment . additionally, a cd4+ t helper  type  <dig> response by the host leads to parasite killing while a th <dig> response leads to parasite growth . less is known about the global changes that take place at the transcriptomic level in both the parasite and host over the course of an infection.

once in host macrophages, leishmania parasites rapidly transform into aflagellated amastigote forms, which are contained inside of parasitophorous vacuoles. the parasite enters host cells by receptor-mediated phagocytosis. it is thought to do so in a quiescent manner, failing to produce a significant oxidative burst and to activate the innate immune system . leishmania prevent their killing by altering cytokine expression , impeding antigen display by mhc class ii molecules, and hindering nitric oxide production .

previous studies using microarrays have started to elucidate changes that occur within the parasite or within the host as infection occurs , but have so far not sought to look at the transcriptomes of both simultaneously and over the course of an intracellular infection. studies on host response have identified genes that are differentially regulated upon infection with various leishmania species, sometimes with opposing results. some of these differences may be attributable to the parasite species and host systems used, the severity of the resulting infection, and the timepoints examined. additionally, studies of leishmania amastigotes have often used axenic cultures  <cit>  or lesion-derived amastigotes  <cit> . the former have been shown to significantly differ from the intracellular biological state  <cit>  while the latter contain a mixture of amastigotes at various timepoints post-infection, making it difficult to differentiate between changes that take place early versus later during intracellular infection.

in this study, we performed transcriptome profiling using rna-seq to concurrently identify global changes in host and parasite gene expression that occur over the first 72 h of a synchronized intracellular infection of murine peritoneal macrophages with leishmania major. a paired-end mrna sequencing approach was used to allow high-confidence read mapping and transcript assembly. collection of data from multiple biological replicates, the use of matched host control samples, careful statistical analysis of variation, and removal of batch effects provided us with a unique ability to detect biological differences between samples and timepoints with high confidence and sensitivity. differential gene expression analysis enabled us to identify host and parasite genes that were modulated over time, and pathway and gene ontology analyses provided insights into the higher level processes activated during infection. this work builds on and improves existing expression datasets and provides insights into how leishmania is able to evade host defenses and cause modulations in the host transcriptome in order to survive in the mammalian intracellular environment.

RESULTS
infection dynamics and global transcription patterns
transcriptome profiling by rna-seq was used to identify global changes in gene expression over the course of the first 72 h of an infection of murine macrophages with leishmania major. peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/ <dig> mice were infected with l. major metacyclic promastigotes and samples collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h post-infection . the dynamics of the infection were monitored by counting the number of parasites per  <dig> macrophages . rna sequencing was carried out for each sample and for matched uninfected controls, as well as for the l. major metacyclic promastigotes used for the infection. over  <dig>  billion sequence reads were collected across three independent experiments  and labeled as batches a-c .fig.  <dig> characterization of l. major intracellular growth and proportion of rna from the parasite. mouse macrophages infected with l. major were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi and subjected to transcriptional profiling by rna-seq. an average of 87 % of macrophages were infected across all samples. bar plots are used to illustrate a the average number of parasites observed per  <dig> host cells and b the average percentage of trimmed rna-seq reads that map to the l. major genome. standard errors bars are shown. no statistically significant changes were observed between timepoints



since there is little sequence conservation between mouse and l. major, we were able to unambiguously map reads from mouse and parasite rnas from the mixed sample to their respective genomes. for uninfected samples, the percentage of reads mapping to the mouse genome ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. greater heterogeneity was observed for the percentage of reads mapping to l. major in the infected samples, providing clues about the transcriptional activity of both parasite and host . for each batch, the percentage of reads mapping to the parasite decreased over the course of the infection . interestingly, this decrease in the relative portion of parasite reads did not match the parasite load of the infected cells, which decreased sharply between  <dig> and 24 h for each batch and remained constant or slowly rose again from  <dig> through 72 h . possible explanations for the mismatch between the constant/increasing number of parasites and the decreasing percentage of parasite reads is that the individual parasites are less transcriptionally active as the infection progresses or that the mouse cells became more transcriptionally active over the course of the infection, thereby diluting the proportion of reads attributable to the parasite.

samples from host and from parasite showed a similar distribution of per-gene read counts per sample, as visualized by box plots , but striking differences were observed when comparing the two organisms. the median steady-state expression level was elevated in l. major compared to mouse  and l. major genes showed a much more narrow distribution . additionally, when non- and lowly-expressed genes were removed from the datasets prior to differential expression analysis, this filter led to the removal of  <dig>  genes from the mouse dataset, but only  <dig> genes from the parasite one.

the differences in the distribution of genes between mouse and l. major are consistent with differences in how each organism controls gene expression - mouse employs both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to control the expression levels of individual genes, resulting in many genes that are not expressed and a wide dynamic range for those that are. this differs from leishmania, which employs polycistronic transcription by rna polymerase ii at roughly the same rate across its genome  <cit> . the resulting polycistronic mrnas are split into their component mature mrnas by coupled trans-splicing and polyadenylation events . steady-state mrnas levels of individual genes are thus not determined by the amount of transcription, but by post-transcriptional processes such as rna processing and degradation . the dearth of lowly expressed l. major genes may indicate that very few mrnas are completely degraded following polycistronic transcription.

statistical assessment of biological replicates and batch effects
the use of multiple biological replicates necessitated the evaluation of the data to assess reproducibility and account for batch effects, i.e. experimental variation caused by sub-groups of measurements that are not related to the underlying biology of the system being studied. previous analyses of high-throughput data, like those produced by rna-seq, have indicated the need to assess and correct batch effects in order to prevent misinterpretation of results  <cit> . in this study, experimental start date was used as a surrogate for batch when testing for differential expression.

we used principal component analysis  and euclidean distance heatmap analysis to visualize the relationship between experimental datasets both prior to and after adjusting for batch effects . the pca plots revealed that samples from the same experimental condition  grouped together for the parasite and mouse macrophages demonstrating a high level of reproducibility between biological replicates. the dendrograms associated with the euclidean distance heatmaps further illustrated this point, with like samples clustering most closely with one another. the grouping of samples by experimental condition was partially obscured when batch effects were not considered, illustrating the benefits of this approach . batch effects were therefore controlled for in the subsequent differential expression analyses by including experimental batch in the statistical models used.fig.  <dig> global gene expression profiles of l. major parasites and their murine macrophage host cells. rna-seq was carried out on mouse macrophages infected with l. major at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi as well as on the metacyclic promastigotes used for the infection. principal component analysis  plots and heatmaps of hierarchical clustering analyses using euclidean distance are shown for the l. major  and mouse  transcriptomes over the course of the experiment. the analyses were performed using all annotated protein-coding genes following filtering for low counts and quantile normalization after accounting for batch effects in the statistical model . in the pca plots, the first two principal components are shown on the x and y axes, respectively, with the proportion of total variance attributable to that pc indicated. each experimental sample is represented as a single point with color indicating sample type/timepoint and shape indicating experimental batch. colors along the tops of the heatmaps indicate the sample type/timepoint and colors along the left sides of the heatmaps indicate the experimental batch. samples are named according to sample type , timepoint  and experimental batch  



the pca and clustering analysis also suggested interesting biological relationships between the samples. the global profile of l. major gene expression changed over the time course of the experiment, moving from left to right across principal component   <dig> . the clear separation between promastigote and amastigote samples along pc <dig> highlights the differences between the two developmental stages. while a time progression can be seen within the intracellular amastigote samples, some intermixing of samples from different timepoints was observed beyond  <dig> hpi , suggesting an overlap in the gene expression profiles for these samples.

a time progression was also seen in the mouse macrophage data for both infected and uninfected samples . this observation underscored the necessity of collecting uninfected controls from each timepoint studied rather than relying on a control from a single timepoint. in addition, all infected macrophages from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi clustered more closely with the uninfected macrophages while the  <dig> hpi infected macrophages clustered apart. this is especially apparent in the heatmap dendrogram where the  <dig> hpi infected macrophages appear as a major outgroup.

identification of differentially expressed genes and pathway-based enrichment analyses in murine host macrophages
while clustering analyses provided a high level overview of the behavior of the murine macrophage and parasite transcriptomes during the infection, further analyses were needed to evaluate changes in the expression levels of individual genes. a differential expression analysis was carried out to closely dissect the host murine macrophage response to infection by leishmania major at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h after infection. pairwise analyses were conducted within and across individual timepoints with infected macrophages evaluated against matched uninfected macrophages for each timepoint.

the most substantial response to infection by the macrophage was observed at  <dig> hpi, with  <dig> genes differentially expressed  between uninfected and infected cells with fold changes  ranging from 29-fold downregulated to 56-fold upregulated. the response is reduced in later timepoints as reflected in smaller numbers of de genes -  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi, respectively - and in reduced fold changes with no downregulation beyond 12-fold or upregulation beyond 18-fold for these timepoints. the breakdown of up- and downregulated genes for each timepoint comparison is illustrated in fig. 3a  and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  complete de gene lists for each timepoint are provided in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes in l. major parasites and their murine macrophage host cells. rna-seq was carried out on mouse macrophages infected with l. major at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi as well as on the metacyclic promastigotes used for the infection. pairwise comparisons were done to determine differentially expressed  genes from uninfected vs. infected mouse samples at each timepoint  and between timepoints , and for l. major parasite samples between timepoints . box length depicts the number of de genes either downregulated  or upregulated  at an adjusted p value of <  <dig>  with the total number of down- and upregulated genes shown. color hue indicates sample type/timepoint as defined in fig.  <dig> and color shade indicates the proportion of genes with > 4-fold differential expression , between 2- and 4-fold differential expression , or 2-fold differential expression . the de gene lists for uninfected vs. infected mouse cells at each timepoint were compared and the overlap shown as a venn diagram in . the complete lists of de genes are provided in additional file  <dig> for mouse and additional file  <dig> for l. major




a direct comparison of the overlap in de genes at each timepoint revealed that the macrophage response to infection at  <dig> hpi was vastly different from the response at the later timepoints . of the  <dig> de genes at  <dig> hpi, 93 %  were unique to  <dig> hpi. this is in contrast to 40 % of genes at  <dig> hpi , 33 % of genes at  <dig> hpi , and 33 % of genes at  <dig> hpi  that were de only at that specific timepoint. indeed, only  <dig> genes were consistently up- or downregulated at all  <dig> timepoints . these genes do not appear to be functionally related, although the list does include the heavy metal transporters metallothionein  <dig> and  <dig>  the latter has previously been associated with leishmania resistance to treatment with antimonial drugs  <cit> . interestingly, two genes associated with bcl <dig> , an inhibitor of apoptosis, are also on this list, suggesting that infection by l. major may induce changes in host gene expression to prevent macrophages from undergoing cell death.

in order to detect statistically significant differences in gene expression over time, we conducted differential expression analysis across timepoints. contrasts between successive timepoints revealed a large number of de genes during the  <dig> to  <dig> hpi transition , but almost no statistically significant genes between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi  or between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi  . this suggests that the large initial response of the murine macrophages to l. major infection stabilized by  <dig> hpi with no additional changes detected for the remainder of the time course as the infected cells mostly maintain their expression profile relative to matched uninfected cells.

the cellular processes most affected at each timepoint were characterized by kegg pathway enrichment analysis using consensuspathdb  <cit> . genes that were de >2-fold were used as input with upregulated and downregulated genes considered separately. the results of this analysis are reported in table  <dig>  additional file 2: table s <dig> and table s <dig>  and additional file  <dig> table  <dig> kegg pathways enriched in murine macrophages at  <dig> hpi. kegg pathway analysis using consensuspathdb  <cit>  identified signaling and metabolic pathways that were over-represented in l. major-infected mouse macrophages at  <dig> hpi  relative to uninfected controls. genes that were differentially expressed  by more than 2-fold were used as input with up- and downregulated genes considered separately. for each enriched kegg pathway, the number of de genes assigned to that pathway, the total number of genes in the pathway, and the p value for the enrichment are reported. the differentially expressed genes corresponding to each enriched kegg pathway are reported in additional file 4




the enriched kegg pathways were considered alongside the de gene lists to gain insights into the cellular response to infection and how it differs between early and later infection. early in the infection , many of the kegg pathways that are most highly induced in infected macrophages are related to immune responses, specifically cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and arginine and proline metabolism, glycolysis, and multiple signaling pathways including those for tnf, hif- <dig>  nf-kappa b, jak-stat, pi3k-akt, and mapk. a closer look at the de genes in the immune response-related pathways reveals an interesting picture of the murine macrophage response to infection at  <dig> hpi. infected macrophages produce a set of transcripts with paradoxical functions involved in both activating immune responses and promoting tissue regeneration and wound healing. many of the de genes associated with enriched pathways are anti-inflammatory in character or are involved in tissue growth and repair, including csf <dig>  csf <dig>  il <dig>  il11r, il1rn, socs <dig>  hmox <dig>  egfr, vegf, and fos-induced growth factor . the product of each of these genes has either been associated with reducing inflammation or promoting cell survival or differentiation. therefore, macrophages infected with l. major appear to assume an immunoregulatory phenotype that resembles previously described macrophages treated with lps and immune complex  <cit> . however, not all of the differentially induced genes in infected macrophages at  <dig> hpi were anti-inflammatory. there was also an upregulation of transcripts encoding well-described inflammatory cytokines and their receptors including il <dig>  il <dig>  tnf, and nos <dig>  as well as il1rap and il18r <dig>  the pro-inflammatory nod-like receptor signaling pathway is enriched among both upregulated and downregulated genes at  <dig> hpi with some members of the pathway upregulated  and others downregulated . it is unclear to what extent the observed expression patterns are being driven by the parasite as it is taken into the host cell, or are being promoted by the host as it attempts to limit infection or to protect itself from the negative effects of a robust immune response.

pathway analysis also showed an upregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis at  <dig> hpi. upregulated genes encode glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinases, enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase a. an increase in anaerobic glycolysis has been associated with the stimulation of inflammatory responses in macrophages following tlr ligation  <cit> . glycolytic pathways were also enriched among upregulated genes at  <dig> hpi, but this effect was not seen at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. thus, following phagocytosis of l. major, macrophages undergo transient metabolic alterations that result in an increase in glycolysis and the generation of atp.

kegg pathways downregulated at  <dig> hpi are mostly related to lipid metabolism and biogenesis and include osteoclast differentiation, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, ppar signaling, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. decreases in the receptors and signaling molecules involved in the process of phagocytosis itself  were also observed at  <dig> hpi. it has been previously shown that phagocytosis of leishmania and other pathogens via fc gamma receptors leads to parasite killing while phagocytosis via pathways mediated by complement receptor  <dig>  leads to parasite survival . the downregulation of fc gamma receptors may be a mechanism by which the parasite induces changes in host cells to promote alternative entry mechanisms that will support its survival. while we observed a slight downregulation of mrna levels for c3ar <dig>  c5ar <dig>  and c5ar <dig> early in infection, upregulation of c5ar <dig> was detected at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi.

an examination of the enriched kegg pathways at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi reveals different enrichment patterns from those observed at  <dig> hpi . there are a greater number of pathways downregulated than upregulated during each of these later timepoints, but no clear picture otherwise emerges.

while a significant number of disease-specific kegg pathways are enriched among up- and downregulated genes reported at various timepoints in this study , a linkage between these disease and our dataset may not be particularly meaningful. this is because the kegg pathways for these individual diseases appear to be constructed using a combination of heterogeneous observations from multiple studies of individual genes using data from different experiments, hosts, cell types, and timepoints, rather than using gene lists derived from a single or set of genome-wide studies, and as a result paint an incomplete picture of the global changes in gene expression. therefore, while it is interesting to note small overlaps between the comprehensive de profiles in this study and genes included in these pathways, the differences in scope between the lists limit the usefulness of comparisons to disease kegg pathways as currently defined.

we compared the results of our differential expression analysis to previously published reports on the murine macrophage response to leishmania infection. since global transcriptome studies of l. major infection of macrophages isolated from c57bl/ <dig> mice are not available, we compared our results to studies that used either the same mouse strain or the same leishmania species . in a study detailing the infection of c57bl/ <dig> peritoneal macrophages with l. amazonensis  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were identified as de  between infected and uninfected macrophages at  <dig> hpi. this number compares to  <dig> and  <dig> de genes  at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively, in our dataset with an overlap of only  <dig> genes  differentially expressed in the same direction at  <dig> or  <dig> hpi. similarly, we compared the infection of balb/c bone marrow-derived macrophages with l. major as reported in two recent studies. of the  <dig> genes identified when comparing the transcriptomes of l. major-infected balb/c macrophages to macrophages that had ingested latex beads , only  <dig> were in common with our  <dig> hpi timepoint  <cit> . however,  <dig> genes were in common with our  <dig> hpi timepoint, indicating that the time progression observed between the two systems may be somewhat offset. of the  <dig> genes identified as de by more than  <dig> -fold during the 24 h timecourse experiment reported by rabhi et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were also found to be differentially expressed in the same direction in our dataset at either  <dig> or  <dig> hpi with the greatest number of genes found in common with our  <dig> hpi dataset . the limited agreement between the previously reported de genes and our dataset is likely a reflection of the differences in study design , batch effects between laboratories, technical platforms, and data analysis methods.

identification of differentially expressed genes and gene ontology-based enrichment analyses in l. major parasites
while past studies have used microarrays and other methods to study changes in leishmania gene expression between promastigotes and amastigotes  <cit> , this study provided a unique opportunity to additionally characterize gene expression patterns within amastigotes over the course of an intracellular infection. differential expression analysis revealed a large number of genes  to be de between metacyclic promastigotes and 4-h amastigotes at an adjusted p value cutoff of < <dig> , reflecting the significant differentiation event that occurs as the parasite enters host cells. significantly fewer changes in expression were observed in amastigotes across timepoints, with  <dig> de genes found between 4- and 24-h amastigotes and no de genes between either 24- and 48-h amastigotes or between 48- and 72-h amastigotes . this pattern of differential gene expression is consistent with observations of gene expression over time in the mouse macrophages and suggests that the initial reprogramming that occurs upon infection had largely been stabilized by  <dig> hpi.

gene ontology  analysis was used to identify cellular functions and processes that characterize the entry and survival of l. major in the murine macrophage system. these results were considered alongside the lists of de genes to draw insights into how the parasite adapts to its new environment. efforts were made to compare the results of this study to previous work, though our ability to conduct meaningful systematic comparisons was constrained due to the use of different parasite systems , host systems , experimental platforms , and methods for assessing and reporting differential expression .

go analysis of the up- and downregulated genes identified during the metacyclic promastigote to 4-h amastigote transition revealed a total of  <dig> enriched go categories. enriched go terms for genes upregulated during this transition were primarily related to mitigating the effects of an oxidative response by the host immune system and the regulation of proteins . heat shock proteins, especially hsp <dig>  multiple tryparedoxin peroxidase family members, and multiple cyclophilins were upregulated upon entry of metacyclic promastigotes into host cells and contributed strongly to the go enrichment results for the upregulated genes. hsp <dig>  the cytoplasmic form of hsp <dig>  is known to stabilize transcription factors and kinases and is thus largely involved in the regulation of signaling networks involved in differentiation  <cit> , and tryparedoxin peroxidase is known to contribute to leishmania virulence and resistance to antimonial drugs  <cit> . less is known about the role of cyclophilins in leishmania, though these peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases have been shown to reactivate cellular proteins by promoting their disaggregation  <cit> . the upregulation of cyclophilin in l. major amastigotes has been previously observed   <cit> . many types of surface antigens were highly upregulated, as was the zinc-metalloprotease gp <dig>   <cit> , and phosphoglycan beta  <dig>  galactosyltransferase  family members, which are responsible for modifications to the leishmania lipophosphoglycan  surface molecule side chains  <cit>  and have been previously observed to be upregulated in leishmania amastigotes  <cit> . that there are significant changes taking place on the surface of the parasite is not surprising given the transformation that takes place as differentiation progresses from the promastigote to amastigote forms. other genes upregulated during the metacyclic promastigote to 4-h amastigote transition included meta <dig>  which is thought to play a role in virulence and was previously found to be upregulated in infective metacyclic promastigotes relative to non-infective procyclic promastigotes  <cit> , and inositol-3-phosphate synthase , which synthesizes myo-inositol, a precursor molecule for the backbone of the gpi anchors used by many leishmania surface proteins, including multiple virulence factors  <cit> . interestingly, the gene encoding the transporter for myo-inositol   <cit>  was among the most downregulated during the transition, perhaps indicating that the parasite favors synthesizing de novo rather than importing this important substrate once it enters mammalian cells.table  <dig> gene ontology  categories enriched across l. major stages/timepoints. goseq  <cit>  was used to identify enriched go categories for the transition between metacyclic promastigotes and 4-h amastigotes and between 4-h amastigotes and 24-h amastigotes at a p value cutoff of <  <dig> . for each transition, up- and downregulated genes were considered separately. the category for each enriched go term is indicated . the differentially expressed genes corresponding to each enriched go category are reported in additional file 7




go terms that were enriched among downregulated genes during the metacyclic promastigote to 4-h amastigote transition were related to translation, cell signaling, fatty acid biosynthesis, and flagellum structure . a number of genes were responsible for driving the go results, including ribosomal proteins, casein kinase, receptor-type adenylate cyclase, fatty acid elongase, sphingolipid delta desaturase, and paraflagellar rod protein. the downregulation of ribosomal proteins during the leishmania promastigote to amastigote transition is consistent with previous reports  <cit>  and may reflect a reduction in translation taking place within the cell. casein kinase is thought to play a role in leishmania promastigote growth and parasite virulence via interactions with host proteins, though its exact function is unclear  <cit> . likewise, adenylate cyclase is a suspected regulator of camp signaling during leishmania differentiation  <cit> , but the exactly signaling pathways through which this is accomplished are unknown. fatty acids have many potential roles within the cell related to membrane structure and composition, signaling, and energy. fatty acid elongase family members are involved in fatty acid synthesis and may be involved in gpi anchoring  <cit> , while sphingolipid delta  <dig> desaturase is involved in the degradation of sphingolipids, a process that has been linked to enabling leishmania to survive the acidic environment of the phagolysosome once it is taken into host cells  <cit> . genes that influence microtubule length and dynamics were systematically downregulated, including those that encode paraflagellar rod proteins, calmodulin-related proteins  <cit> , multiple kinesins  <cit> , nima-related kinases  <cit> , and mitogen-activated protein  kinase kinases . these genes have been implicated in the regulation of flagellum length and mitotic spindle formation and may reflect changes in morphology and cell division that take place as the flagellated promastigote stage parasites transform into the aflagellated amastigotes. consistent with previous microarray-based studies  <cit> , we also detected the downregulation of the known metacyclic markers sherp and hasp as the parasite transformed from promastigotes to amastigotes.

of the  <dig> go categories enriched during the transition from  <dig> to 24-h amastigotes, those related to microtubules and protein complexes were specific to upregulated genes with many copies of β-tubulin, the primary component of microtubules, almost exclusively driving the go analysis results. the upregulation of β-tubulin in early amastigotes compared to metacyclic promastigotes is noteworthy considering its downregulation in metacyclic promastigotes compared to procyclic promastigotes  <cit> . besides β-tubulin, many other top upregulated genes encoded surface antigens, including the developmentally-regulated amastigote-enriched protein amastin  <cit> . go categories related to glucose metabolism and oxidation-reduction processes were enriched among downregulated genes with many of the downregulated genes contributing to these categories belonging to the glycolysis pathway  or related to cholesterol/sterol metabolism  or purine metabolism . this may indicate a change in the metabolic requirements or preferences of leishmania once the parasites have survived their initial entry into the mammalian cell. other highly downregulated genes included heat shock proteins, biopterin transporters, and meta <dig>  <cit> .

a very significant dataset resulting from this study includes the large proportion of the de genes which have no known function and are annotated as hypothetical proteins. those make up 58 %  of the de genes in the metacyclic to 4-h amastigote transition and 49 %  of the de genes in the 4- to 24-h amastigote transition. while hypothetical genes have largely been overlooked to date, they almost certainly constitute an integral part of the transcriptomic signature of the parasites as members of co-expressed gene networks which are involved in common functional pathways or regulated by shared regulatory mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed transcriptomic profiling to identify genes that were differentially expressed in both parasite and host cells as l. major entered and persisted within murine macrophages during the first 72 h of an infection. the generation of rna-seq data followed by the unambiguous mapping of reads from infected samples to the genomes of both the host and the parasite enabled us to identify genes that changed over the course of infection in the real-time context of a dynamic dual biological system, and to a much greater depth and sensitivity than has been previously reported. collection of data from multiple biological replicates, the use of matched host control samples, careful statistical analysis of variation, and removal of batch effects provided us with a unique ability to detect biological differences between samples and timepoints with high confidence and sensitivity.

in addition to providing robust sets of markers for multiple developmental stages of l. major parasites and leishmania-infected macrophages over several timepoints, this work contributes to a growing body of literature on the broader field of host-pathogen interactions. indeed, the comprehensive dataset generated in this study will also serve as a reference for future studies using different leishmania strains  to examine infection of macrophages from multiple sources and in various states of activation, polarization, or rest. in conjunction with datasets that will be produced for other pathogens, a clearer picture of the signature of intracellular infection will emerge, providing additional insights into how pathogens are able to evade host defenses and modulate the biological functions of the cell in order to survive in the mammalian environment.
