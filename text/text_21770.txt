BACKGROUND
osteosarcoma  is the most common cancer of bone in dogs  <cit> . tumors usually arise in the appendicular skeleton and metastasize to the lung. in cases with localized appendicular disease, amputation of the affected limb along with chemotherapy can extend life expectancy up to about  <dig> months on average but there is no cure. an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of os is needed in order to facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. one such strategy is to combine drugs with different mechanisms of action in an attempt to overcome tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. in this regard, it is reasonable to consider adding new antineoplastic drugs to the treatments of patients receiving traditional chemotherapeutics and one such candidate for this is the antimicrobial and antineoplastic drug taurolidine  <cit> .

taurolidine is a derivative of the amino acid taurine that has anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects against a variety of cancers  <cit> . originally developed for its antibacterial properties, taurolidine has few detrimental effects on normal cells  <cit>  but inhibits cancer cell proliferation  <cit>  and tumor growth by inducing apoptosis  <cit>  possibly through p53-dependent mechanisms  <cit> . taurolidine modulates apoptosis by altering bcl-2/bax concentrations  <cit> , and exerts anti-metastatic effects within the tumor microenvironment through inhibition of angiogenesis and endothelial cell adhesion  <cit> . taurolidine appears to induce autophagy and necroptosis in glioma cell lines  <cit>  and has been used to treat glioblastoma and gastric carcinoma in humans  <cit> . this study tested taurolidine against human and canine osteosarcoma cell lines to determine its cytotoxicity and potential as an adjuvant therapy for doxorubicin or carboplatin treatment in dogs with os.

methods
in vitro testing
four canine and one human os cell lines were used in this study. they included canine d <dig> , clone  <dig>  developed in our laboratory  <cit> , cos  <cit> , and hmpos  <cit> , and the human cell line saos- <dig>  which was included to establish consistency with reports using human cell lines. cells were cultured at 37°c in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere in rpmi  <dig>  supplemented with 2mm glutamine, 2mm sodium pyruvate, 2mm hepes, 1% pen-strep, and 10% fetal bovine serum. taurolidine  with and without 5% polyvinylpyrrolidone  was kindly provided by tauropharm gmbh . doxorubicin  and carboplatin  were individually diluted 1: <dig> in rpmi  <dig> prior to use. combinations of taurolidine with doxorubicin or carboplatin were tested against saos- <dig>  clone  <dig>  and d <dig> cell lines.

cell viability was assessed using an mts assay . cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of  <dig> or  <dig> cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight. the medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing various concentrations of taurolidine, and/or doxorubicin or carboplatin. absorbance was measured at λ <dig> after  <dig> minutes, 37°c, incubation with the mts product. data are expressed as means ± sd of triplicate wells, or quadruplicate wells, for the carboplatin experiments and are representative of at least two independent experiments.

the major effects of taurolidine were observed after  <dig> hrs incubation; therefore taurolidine-only experiments were performed using a  <dig> hr incubation period and  <dig> cells/well in the 96-well plates. the doxorubicin and carboplatin experiments required  <dig> hr incubation periods so these were seeded with fewer cells  to limit cell contact inhibition.

our initial experiments used taurolidine that contained 5% pvp which is used as a stabilizing agent for storage purposes. once we learned that dogs are allergic to pvp, we changed to taurolidine without pvp. thus taurolidine without pvp was used for all subsequent experiments, which were those that included carboplatin.

apoptotic changes in target cells were detected using three independent methods. these included a colorimetric elisa based on the detection of nucleosomes formed as a result of dna fragmentation, flow cytometric detection of early apoptotic changes in the cell membrane, and by western blot for parp cleavage, which is an indirect indication of caspase activity. for the nucleosome elisas, cells were initially treated as described above. after  <dig>  and  <dig> hrs exposure to  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm taurolidine or pvp alone, culture supernatants were removed and processed using a commercially available kit . absorbance was measured at λ <dig> 

flow cytometry was used to detect binding of annexin-v to phosphotidyl serine on the surface of cells in early apoptosis and propidium iodide to dna in late stage apoptosis or dead cells. tumor cells were incubated with  <dig> μm taurolidine and collected, using  <dig> % trypsin in pbs to release the adherent cells, after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs and reacted with biotinylated annexin v-fitc and propidium iodide using a commercially available kit . a minimum of  <dig>  cells per sample were collected on a beckman coulter fc- <dig> flow cytometer. data analysis and software compensation were performed using winlist .

parp cleavage, a surrogate marker of caspase activity, was determined by western blot using cells that had been exposed to two concentrations of taurolidine with and without prior incubation with the general caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk , as described  <cit> . briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates  and allowed to adhere overnight. cells were incubated in  <dig> μm z-vad-fmk or dmso in supplemented rpmi medium for  <dig> min. the medium was changed and the cells were subsequently incubated in  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μm taurolidine in supplemented rpmi for  <dig> hrs and processed as described below.

cells were seeded  in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight prior to incubation as described above and in figure legends. at the end of the incubation period, the media and cells were removed, using a cell scraper, and the cells were pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge . cell pellets were rinsed by re-suspending twice in  <dig> mls ice cold pbs and extracted in  <dig> μl ice cold ripa buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail . extracts were sonicated four times  using an ultrasonic dismembranator  and pelleted at  <dig>  × g to remove cellular debris. protein concentration was measured using a bradford assay . proteins  were separated on 4-12% sds polyacrylamide gels and transferred to pvdf membranes using standard methods. the membranes were blocked in  <dig> % albumin and reacted with indicated primary antibodies diluted 1: <dig> for  <dig> hrs at room temperature . the membranes were washed, reacted with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody  diluted  <dig> : <dig>  and exposed to substrate .

because d <dig> cells expressed minimal amount of parp, we performed an immunoprecipitation  prior to western blots as described above. briefly,  <dig> μg parp antibody was suspended in  <dig> ml of ip buffer  and reacted overnight with protein a/g linked agarose beads . the following day,  <dig> mg of protein from whole cell extracts was added and allowed to react at room temperature for  <dig> hours. the beads were rinsed several times in ip buffer and immune complexes were eluted in  <dig> ul sds page loading buffer and separated as described above for western blots.

nuclear accumulation of p <dig> protein is an indication of mutation in the p <dig> gene  <cit> . as an initial screen for possible p <dig> mutants, we used immunocytochemistry to detect abnormal expression of p <dig> in four canine os cell lines. normal canine lymphocytes obtained from a fine needle aspirate of a lymph node from a healthy dog were used as a control. cells were pelleted onto positively charged slides and allowed to air dry. the slides were subsequently fixed in acetone, air dried and stained according to standard methods  <cit>  using a monoclonal antibody against p <dig> protein , chromagen nova red  as a secondary and hematoxylin  as the counter stain. stained cells were imaged on a microscope and scoring was performed analogous to the hercep test system  <cit> . briefly, two independent individuals scored the staining intensity of each slide in several representative fields using a subjective scoring criteria consisting of a rating of  <dig> for no staining to a rating of  <dig> for strong positive staining in all cells.

phase contrast photomicrographs were obtained with an inverted microscope  using the 40x objective lens, and a digital camera. images were processed using nis-elements software .

data analyses
the 50% inhibitory concentrations  were calculated with prism graphpad software using non-linear regression and the log of the inhibitor versus variable slope response equation. constraints were set at 100% for the top and  <dig> and − <dig>  for the baselines in figures  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

the type of interaction between taurolidine and doxorubicin or carboplatin was determined using the following equations  <cit> :

 synergistic=sft+y<sftxsfy 

 additive=sft+y=sftxsfy 

 sub−additive=sftxsfy<sft+y<sftandsfy 

 antagonistic=sft+y>sftorsfy 

sft+y = surviving fraction of cells exposed to the combination of taurolidine and doxorubicin or carboplatin, sft = surviving fraction of cells exposed to taurolidine alone, sfy = surviving fraction of cells exposed to doxorubicin or carboplatin alone. interactions were determined only for those combinations which led to a surviving fraction of cells that were significantly different than those of each individual drug at the same respective concentration. these equations are appropriate provided the effect is anti-proliferative  <cit> , a condition that was met when the interaction was determined except in cell line d <dig>  at low concentrations , carboplatin had pro-proliferative effects in cell line d <dig>  for these concentrations, the sf of the control group was used in the equation for the sf of carboplatin as it was the most stringent conditions to evaluate the drug interaction.

univariate anova with tukey’s posthoc tests, when appropriate, were performed using pasw- <dig> software. data in figure 2a and 2b are normalized to a baseline absorbance value taken at the initiation of the drug incubation period, to account for the cell count at time zero, and expressed as percent difference on the y-axis.

flow cytometry data  were analyzed using chi-squared tests to compare differences in necrosis versus apoptosis. data shown in figure 3d were analyzed using linear regression with prism graphpad, software . p values ≤ . <dig> were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
taurolidine-induced cytoxicity
the potential effects of pvp alone were assessed by comparing untreated cells with cells treated with pvp at the same concentration as those in the high taurolidine condition. this amounted to  <dig> % pvp which had no discernible effect on the cell lines or the mts assay . taurolidine had concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects against all cell lines tested . the intensity of the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin were also cell line dependent with the major effects of the drug occurring at the lower concentrations and little additional benefit from higher concentrations of drug . the ic50s for taurolidine and doxorubicin alone are shown in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin or carboplatin alone and in combination with taurolidine. data in figure 2a and b are graphed using percent difference along the y-axis. thus, cells that have doubled in number have a y value of  <dig>  zero indicates no change in cell number and values below  <dig> indicate cell numbers were lower than they were at the beginning of the experiment. graphed in this way, it can be seen that  <dig> μm taurolidine enhanced the effect of doxorubicin but the best that could be expected under these conditions would be, on average, zero growth. adding  <dig> μm taurolidine to carboplatin enhanced the effect of carboplatin alone but only in the d <dig> cell line. in most cases, the  <dig> μm taurolidine plus carboplatin combinations resulted in fewer remaining cells than were present at time zero . the ic50s for the drug combination studies are shown in table  <dig>  the photomicrographs in figure 2c and d show doxorubicin and doxorubicin plus taurolidine treated d <dig> cells  after  <dig> hours drug incubation. only the doxorubicin-taurolidine combination induced cytoplasmic contraction which is an early indicator of apoptosis  <cit> .

taurolidine-induced apoptosis
annexin v-fitc and propidium iodide flow cytometry was used to quantify the proportion of d <dig> cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis in response to  <dig> μm taurolidine at three time points . apoptotic changes predominated over necrosis during the early stages of taurolidine cytotoxicity . after  <dig> hours, 15% of d <dig> cells demonstrated early apoptotic changes and 28% had progressed to late apoptotic or necrotic stages . the release of nucleosomes from d <dig> cells was also used to evaluate the apoptotic response to  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm taurolidine . the lower concentration of taurolidine triggered a greater apoptotic response at both the  <dig> and  <dig> hour time points . the  <dig> μm concentration was also more effective at inducing caspase activity as indicated by parp cleavage . the hmpos cells showed the greatest response with complete parp cleavage when exposed to  <dig> μm taurolidine. parp cleavage was not observed in hmpos cells exposed to  <dig> μm taurolidine . the addition of caspase inhibitor  blocked parp cleavage under these conditions indicating that  <dig> μm taurolidine induces apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial cytochrome-c caspase cascade  <cit> . this response was present but considerably less pronounced in cos and saos- <dig> cells and was not seen in the d <dig> and clone  <dig> cell lines. because taurolidine induced parp cleavage in the hmpos but not d <dig> cells, we investigated taurolidine-induced cytotoxicity with and without caspase inhibition using an mts cytotoxicity assay. figure 3d shows the caspase inhibitor had no effect on the cytotoxic effect of taurolidine on d <dig> cells but protected hmpos cells from death in the presence of low concentrations of taurolidine. these results indicate that taurolidine exerts cytotoxic effects through multiple mechanisms that are both caspase-dependent and independent. we hypothesized these differences might be modulated by the mutational/functional status of p <dig> 

taurolidine effects on expression of p <dig> protein in os cell lines
because mutant p <dig> is responsible for evasion of apoptosis in many cancers  <cit> , we sought to determine the role of p53-triggered apoptosis in response to taurolidine treatment. first, immunocytochemistry was used to evaluate canine os cell lines for p <dig> expression in resting cells. data shown in figure  <dig>  and summarized in table  <dig>  suggest p <dig> protein accumulates strongly in hmpos, mildly in clone- <dig> and is absent in cos and d <dig> cells. taurolidine treatment caused a dramatic decrease in p <dig> protein expression in hmpos but an opposite effect in d <dig> cells where protein expression strongly increased . we interpret this to indicate the possibility that p53-mediated apoptosis in response to taurolidine proceeds appropriately in d <dig>  but not in hmpos cells  <cit> .

discussion
osteosarcoma continues to be a major cause of death for dogs worldwide. often, microscopic metastases exist at diagnosis and these lead to a dismal prognosis. early treatment with chemotherapy and surgery prolongs survival but unacceptable drug toxicity prevents dose escalation to levels capable of reversing metastatic disease. new drug treatments are therefore desperately needed. in the present studies we investigated taurolidine alone, and in combination with doxorubicin or carboplatin in vitro as a potential adjuvant therapy for canine os. the ic50s reported here are similar to those reported for human os cell lines  <cit>  and a maximal apoptotic response was observed at a concentration of  <dig> μm, which is a clinically achievable concentration in both humans  <cit>  and dogs . drug levels above  <dig> μm had little, if any, additional benefit and cell death at these concentrations appeared to occur by a mechanism other than apoptosis. this is consistent with previously reported findings that showed taurolidine promotes apoptosis at lower concentrations and necrosis at higher concentrations  <cit> .

the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for os in dogs are doxorubicin, carboplatin, and cisplatin  <cit>  although doxorubicin and carboplatin are currently preferred because cisplatin is highly nephrotoxic in dogs. accordingly we sought to determine the potential for a synergistic interaction when exposing cells to taurolidine and doxorubicin or carboplatin. only certain combinations of taurolidine and doxorubicin or taurolidine and carboplatin achieved a surviving fraction  of cells that was different from that of each drug by itself . when the sfs were different, the interaction between the drugs was synergistic. in the experiments with carboplatin we chose to also test taurolidine at  <dig> μm to reflect the concentration achieved in the serum of dogs . at that concentration, taurolidine alone was so effective that in essence adding carboplatin could not improve on those results . our drug combination studies demonstrate taurolidine can be combined to enhance the sensitivity of os cells to doxorubicin or carboplatin in vitro. optimal drug concentrations and incubation periods appeared cell line dependent and were not fully elucidated here.

once we learned that dogs are allergic to pvp, we changed to taurolidine without pvp to better reflect the potential clinical use of taurolidine in dogs. pvp is a stabilizing agent for storage purposes. our experiments indicated that pvp alone did not have cytotoxic activity against os cells in vitro. it is possible that without pvp, the taurolidine solution could lose its biologic activity. however our results show that taurolidine retains its cytotoxic activity in the absence of pvp.

we performed two independent assays of apoptosis that show the cytotoxic effects of taurolidine at  <dig> μm proceeds through apoptotic mechanisms in canine os cells. our results reveal that apoptosis begins within  <dig> hours of taurolidine exposure and that response to taurolidine depends on the cell line being tested. we speculated the cell line-specific differences could be, in part, due to p <dig> functional status. our results support this hypothesis although definitive studies remain to be carried out in this regard.

CONCLUSIONS
taurolidine is cytotoxic to canine os in vitro and has the potential to enhance the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin or carboplatin in animals with os. preliminary clinical trials to test this hypothesis are currently underway in our facility.
