BACKGROUND
phycobiliproteins are subunits of the major accessory light-harvesting complexes  of most cyanobacteria and red alga and are present in the thylakoid lumen of cryptophytes as well. covalently linked to the proteins are chromophore groups, the phycobilins  <cit> . these open tetrapyrrole rings are coupled to conserved cysteine residues via a thioether bond and are necessary for light harvesting and efficient energy flow  <cit> . various phycobiliproteins, namely allophycocyanin, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, phycoerythrocyanin, carry different numbers of bilin groups.

attachment of bilins to phycobiliproteins is an enzymatically catalyzed reaction, which also occurs spontaneously, but at low efficiency  <cit> . several bilin-attaching lyases are described. one of the dimeric enzymes encoded by cpce and cpcf genes links the chromophore to the phycocyanin α-subunit  <cit> . pece and pecf genes encode the second known lyase, specific for the phycoerythrocyanin α-subunit  <cit> . recently zhao and co-workers discovered that a cpes-like protein functions as a phycocyanobilin-cysteine-beta <dig> lyase in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  which was the first lyase identified for a β-subunit of a phycobiliprotein  <cit> . another lyase specific for a β-subunit of a phycobiliprotein was found by shen et al.  <cit> . they identified the gene product of cpct to be a cys-β153-phycocyanobilin lyase in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  moreover, zhao et al. reported the anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> cpes <dig> as a "near-universal" lyase for cysteine-84-binding sites in cyanobacterial phycobiliproteins  <cit> .

in most cyanobacteria and red algae phycobiliproteins are organized in multimeric complexes, called phycobilisomes  <cit> . their antenna structure, located on the cytoplasmic surface of the thylakoid membrane, consists of various linker polypeptides and phycobiliproteins. each phycobilisome is on its part a multimeric complex, composed of a core and several rod structures. phycobilisomes can be subdivided according to their structure. the most common type in cyanobacteria, the hemidiscoidal one, consists of a tricylindrical core and six rods.

allophycocyanin  forms the core structure, connecting the phycobilisomes to the thylakoid membrane via linker proteins. rods can be composed of three different phycobiliproteins: phycocyanin  is located proximal to the core, whereas phycoerythrin  and phycoerythrocyanin  are located distal to the core  <cit> . the phycobilisome rods of each organism differ in their phycobiliprotein composition. synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> harbors hemidiscoidal phycobilisomes. pc, the only biliprotein in the rod structures in this organism, is composed of α- and β-subunits. these subunits dimerize to heterodimers, assemble to hexameric  <dig> discs, and are subsequently coupled to each other, as well as to the ap-core via linker proteins  <cit> . depending on their location , and their molecular mass, linker proteins are divided into four groups  <cit> . beside their main function of mediating the assembly and stability of the phycobilisomes, linker proteins also promote energy transfer towards the reaction centres  <cit> .

guillardia theta is a cryptophyte possessing phycoerythrin as a phycobiliprotein. the β-subunit is encoded on the plastid genome  <cit> , whereas the phycoerythrin α-subunits are encoded by a nuclear-located gene family. in the latter case, the genes encode preproteins containing a tripartite topogenic signal responsible for the translocation across five biological membranes  <cit> . because a wide range of genomic data exists from this unicellular phototrophic organism, existing knowledge can be used to reconstruct the biochemistry of these organisms. the elucidation of protein functions encoded by open reading frames in the nucleomorph genome of guillardia theta is of special interest, as this genome is minimized and should therefore encode only essential proteins. after analyzing the nucleomorph genome data, orf <dig> was identified as being homologous to a number of proteins including slr <dig> from synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and cpct from synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  because cryptophytes are inaccessible to genetic manipulations, we created a slr1649-loss-of-function strain of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and complemented this strain with the nucleomorph-encoded orf.

the generated slr <dig> loss-of-function mutant generally has characteristics conductive with the description by shen et al. for a cpct knock-out in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, additional effects in the slr <dig> knock-out mutant of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> were identified in respect to linker proteins within the phycobilisomes of the mutant. complementation of slr <dig> with the nucleomorph-specific orf <dig> indicated that the cryptophytic protein, although having originated from an organism using phycoerythrin as accessory pigment, attaches a bilin to the position cys-β <dig> of phycocyanin in the cyanobacterium.

RESULTS
in silico analyses
after analyzing the nucleomorph genome of the cryptophyte guillardia theta, we identified an open reading frame  with a high degree of similarity to cyanobacterial genes , that encode soluble proteins possessing a duf <dig> domain. alignments of the cryptophyte sequence with these cyanobacterial sequences indicated that orf <dig> should encode an additional transit peptide as shown by a n-terminal extension. further orfs with homology to orf <dig> and the cyanobacterial homologs are additionally present in the nuclear genome of red alga  <cit> . in higher plants, i.e. arabidopsis thaliana, orfs with some similarity are also present  <cit> . even the bacteriophage s-pm <dig>  which infects synechococcus strains, encodes a homolog of orf <dig>  <cit>  .

cyanobacterial and eukaryotic homologous of orf <dig> were obtained by blast search analysis of the ncbi database, as well as the jgi and cyanobase. the  indicates that no adjacent genes in the same orientation were detectable. orf <dig> homologous genes are in bold. pbp = phycobiliproteins , pc = phycocyanin, pe = phycoerythrin, pec phycoerythrocyanin.

the number of orf <dig> homologues in cyanobacteria varies in several species and does not correlate with the number of phycobiliproteins. nevertheless, there is a strong tendency to express more than one species of orf <dig> homolog in organisms containing multiple types of phycobiliproteins in the rods . based on amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic networks, four monophyletic groups can therefore been assigned . two of them resemble cpet-like proteins ; the other two groups harbor members of slr1649-like type. neither the guillardia theta sequence nor any other eukaryotic sequences can be assigned to any one of the four monophyletic groups.

additionally, clear affiliations of the gloeobacter violaceus pcc  <dig>  and synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  sequences can not be extrapolated. with the exeption of the prochlorococcus species, at least one member of the slr1649-like group is present in all cyanobacteria investigated to date. cpet-like proteins were only detected in cyanobacteria encoding phycoerythrin and/or phycoerythrocyanin. although the proteins of both groups seem to have the same function, further investigations on the corresponding genes relevant in the genomic context revealed a noticeable difference. unlike the genes of the cpet-group, the slr1649-group is by far less conserved in its genomic localization . except for nostoc sp. pcc  <dig>  anabaena variabilis atcc  <dig> and trichodesmium erythraeum ims  <dig>  the localization of the homolog gene is always downstream of cpes. in few cases it is followed by cper. on the other hand, genes for the slr1649-group are rather randomly distributed in the investigated cyanobacterial genomes .

generation of a slr <dig> knock-out strain
we used synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> as a model organism and created first a slr <dig> knockout strain  by inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette into the slr <dig> open reading frame via homologous recombination. the generated homozygous knock-out mutant showes identical features described in shen et al.  <cit> . just like the characterized cpct mutant in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  our knock-out mutant contains a decreased level of phycocyanin up to 60% and a resulting pale green phenotype. the knock-out cells produce smaller phycobilisomes, which could be the cause of their different migration behaviour in sucrose density gradients in comparison to wild type phycobilisomes. furthermore, isolated phycobilisomes showed a red-shifted absorbance maxima and a slightly smaller apparent molecular mass in the β-subunit of phycocyanin on sds-page . after the digestion of purified phycocyanin with formic acid and a phycocyanobilin addition assay, shen et al. concluded after digestion that the cpct gene from synechocccus sp. pcc  <dig> encodes a bilin lyase responsible for the attachment of phycocyanobilin to cys- <dig> on the β-subunit of phycocyanin  <cit> . the same is most likely true for the synechocystis homolog slr <dig> due to the high homology and the similar phenotype between the two knock-out mutants. thus, slr <dig> is thought to attach a bilin group to the homolog position cys- <dig> of β-phycocyanin in synechocystis sp.pcc  <dig> 

isolation and analysis of phycobilisomes
by isolating and analysing phycobilisomes from our knock-out mutant, we observed one additional feature besides the one already known from the characterization of the synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> homolog. as shown in fig. 2a two linker polypeptides, cpcc <dig> and cpcd, encoded by the genes cpcc <dig> and cpcd respectively, are missing in the isolated phycobilisomes of the mutant but could be identified in the wild type during mass spectrometry analysis. the other linker polypeptides cpcc <dig> , cpcg <dig> , apcc  and apce  are present in both strains.

upon further investigations, the absence of the linker proteins was proven not to be a transcriptional effect. in exemplarily reverse transcription experiments for cpcc <dig>  the presence of identical cpcc <dig> transcripts was confirmed in both the mutant and the wild type strain by sequencing the obtained rt-pcr products .

complementation
in order to investigate if the nucleomorph-specific reading frame orf <dig> from the cryptophyte guillardia theta is able complement the effects of the slr <dig> loss-of-function, we integrated this potential gene without its putative transit peptide into the cyanobacterial genome of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  this simultaneously affected the reading frame of slr <dig> and its cis-acting upstream signals . in the complemented strain, slr <dig> is separated from its natural upstream region, generating a promoter-less truncated gene, in which the translational initiator codon and the next two codons are no longer present in the reading frame. the loss of the slr <dig> gene product and the complete segregation of the mutation were shown by immunoblot experiments using polyclonal antibodies generated against slr <dig> . here, cross-reactions of the antibody were shown to be present in the wild type but not in the mutant strain extract. additional analysis of the complemented strain by rt-pcr and sequence analysis showed that the integrated cryptophytic orf <dig> is transcribed .

characterization of the complemented strain
interestingly the phenotype of the complemented strain is similar to that of the wild type strain, as indicated by the greenish color of the culture . during sucrose density-gradient separation of isolated phycobilisomes from the complemented strain, we noticed no difference in the migration behaviour of the prominent band in respect to the wild type strain in contrast to the migration behaviour of the knock-out mutant . this indicates that the size of the phycobilisomes is identical in both strains and could indeed be confirmed by a proteome and mass spectrometry analysis. here we showed that the missing linker proteins of the slr <dig> knock-out strain were present in the complemented strain . additionally, there was no molecular mass shift in the β-subunit of phycocyanin of the complemented strain on sds-page visible. further analyses revealed that the chromophore group, missing at positions cys-β <dig> and cys-β <dig> in the knock-out mutants of synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> respectively, most probably reappeared in the complemented strain, because zn2+ stainings of phycobilisomes separated by sds-page showed an equal signal intensity of the phycobiliproteins of the wild type and complemented strain .

to clarify this we digested isolated phycobiliproteins with formic acid. in doing so, cpcb is cleaved at a single site while all other phycobiliproteins remain unaffected. the expected sizes for fluorescent fragments are  <dig>  kda with a chromophore group at position cys-β <dig> and  <dig>  kda for the fragment with the chromophore group at position cys-β <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  these expected fragments were obtained. in addition to a signal at  <dig>  kda, a signal at  <dig>  kda was detected in the lane containing wild type strain protein and protein from the complemented strain but not in the one containing Δslr <dig> protein. these data confirmed that the chromophore group, missing in the knock-out mutant, is present in the complementation. this together with the identification of the linker protein spectrum in the complemented strain indicated a wild type phycobilisome structure.

discussion
cryptophytes are important organisms for several reasons. in terms of cell biology, their complex compartmentalization is of major interest, because several plasmas and genomes coexist in these organisms, which can be traced back to either a prokaryote or a eukaryote  <cit> . one of the hallmarks of cryptophytes is the remnant of a second nucleus, which originated by the reduction of the cell nucleus of an engulfed phototrophic eukaryote by another eukaryotic cell  <cit> . this compartment, the nucleomorph, is minimized in its coding capacity and expresses – in the case of guillardia theta – only approximately a tenth of that of the e. coli k <dig> genome  <cit> . the reduced coding capacity leads to the impression that the genes are still present in the nucleomorph may encode important functions. thus, we are interested in addressing the functions of proteins encoded by the nucleomorph. however, due to the lack of a method of transfecting cryptophytes, we are studying homologs of the nucleomorph genes and their encoded proteins in genetically accessible organisms in order to identify the functions of the cryptophytic proteins indirectly. one of the best-studied and genetically accessible cyanobacterium is synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> 

orf <dig> is one of the uncharacterized nucleomorph-specific open reading frames, for which homologs are present in many cyanobacteria. analysis of the contribution of this gene within different organisms indicated that a clear correlation between orf222-homolog genes and phycobiliproteins is present, because at least one orf <dig> homolog is encoded in all organisms expressing phycobiliproteins, including red alga. phylogenetic studies demonstrated that homologs of the orf <dig> gene can be classified into the following four groups : slr1649-like a, slr1649-like b, cpet-like a and cpet-like b. because the method for network construction as well as sampling in our studies is different from that of a recently presented phylogeny  <cit> , it is not surprising that slightly different affiliations are resolved. however, our network corrects erroneous affiliations and indicates uncertainties of the basal grouping. this may be seen in the position of the bacteriophage sequence, which is in the network presented here in the neighbourhood of the bacteria they infect and not in the same branch as the cryptophyte sequence.

despite the high degree of homology, the members of slr1649-like and cpet-like groups differ in the genomic context of the corresponding genes . members of the cpet group are predominantly localized in the phycoerythrin associated linker protein operon  <cit>  next to the cpes gene. in some cases, even the cper gene is localized directly downstream of cpet. because operon structures connect functionally related genes in many cases, cpet could be an either structurally or functionally moiety of the phycobilisome and it has been shown to be responsible for the attachment of a bilin group to a specific site from β-phycocyanin  <cit> . it is remarkable that a congruent distribution of members of the slr1649-groups is not visible, because the genes seem to be localized randomly throughout different genomes. interestingly, slr1649-homologs exist in some higher plants such as oryza sativa and arabidopsis thaliana . the encoded proteins of these land plants are characterized by a duf <dig> domain as well, but obviously have paralogous functions, since the arabidopsis thaliana homolog seems to be required for plastid division  <cit> . it is also suggested to play an important role in cell differentiation and the regulation of the cell division plane in plants  <cit> . the same could be true for the copy of the bacteriophage s-pm <dig>  but seems to be unlikely since this phage infects different synechococcus strains and its resource of the homolog may be the result of a selective advantage.

the homozygous knock-out mutant Δslr <dig> in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> showed features identical to a cpct knock-out mutant from synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> described in shen et al.  <cit> . here, the same pale green phenotype and a reduced phycocyanin content, resulting from a missing bilin group in phycobilisomes, was created by knock-out of cpct, homolog to slr <dig> homolog in this cyanobacterium. this indicates that the lyase function of the homologous proteins of synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> is comparable.

nevertheless, we obtained one additional, not described feature in the synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> knock-out mutant. two linker proteins, cpcc <dig> and cpcd, were missing from the phycobilisomes in the knock-out mutant Δslr <dig>  cpcd is a small linker  located at the distal tip of rods, possibly functioning as a rod terminating factor  <cit> . the cpcc <dig> rod linker  connects the most distal located phycocyanin discs  <cit> . both genes are located in the phycocyanin operon from which they are co-transcribed with the phycocyanin subunits and the cpcc <dig> linker gene  <cit> . a transcriptional effect causing the loss of the linker proteins appears to be very unlikely, because the α-subunit, the β-subunit and cpcc <dig> linker are present, although the cpcd and the cpcc <dig> linker are simultaneously absent. this is indicative of our finding that the cpcc <dig> gene is indeed transcribed in the mutant as indicated by reverse transcription experiments . therefore, the deficit of the two linker proteins in mutant phycobilisomes is a post-transcriptional effect. however, we can not rule out that a decreased stability of phycobilisomes caused by the altered β-phycocyanin may be the reason for the lack of the two linker proteins in our preparations. in any case, the lack of the linker proteins is a molecular marker for the loss of lyase function, which may be interested to be studied in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit>  as well.

guillardia theta, the cryptophyte on which we are primarily focusing expresses a homolog of slr <dig> in association with phycoerythrin. phycobiliproteins are located in the thylakoid lumen and apparently not organized in phycobilisomes in cryptophytes. because the cryptophyte guillardia theta uses phycoerythrin and not phycocyanin as an accessory pigment for photosynthesis, one might not expect that the putative cryptophytic lyase is able to complement the one of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  surprisingly, the complemented strain showed wild type phycobilisomes structures as shown by the correct attachment of chromophore groups and the linker protein spectrum. thus, orf <dig> from the cryptophyte is able to complement the loss-of-function of slr <dig>  indicating that the cryptophytic phycoerythrin lyase has still retained the capacity to couple a bilin group to β-phycocyanin, even after the progenitor of both classes of proteins evolved into apparently paralogous ones. however, a pleiotropic function of a biliprotein lyase with a specificity for phycobilin:cysteine- <dig> was recently shown in vitro for cpes <dig> from anabaena pcc  <dig>  <cit> , implicating that a multiplicity of proteins like the cryptophytic phycobilin:cysteine-β <dig> lyase has the capacity to couple bilins to homologous positions in a variety of phycobiliproteins.

CONCLUSIONS
loss-of function of a bilin lyase leads to a variety of effects in phycobilisome structure. this is already shown for a cpct mutant in synechococcus sp. pcc  <dig> and could be confirmed by the generation of a slr <dig> knock-out mutant in synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig>  homolog cpct. one additional feature, the lack of two distal linker proteins, fits with the already known altered phycobilisome structure and may be the reason for the decreased phycocyanin content in mutant missing the bilin lyase.

loss of slr <dig> was complemented in vivo by the homolog orf <dig>  which is encoded by the tiny vestigial nucleus of the eukaryotic endosymbiont from the cryptophyte guillardia theta. thus, orf <dig> is supposed to be a phycoerythrin-bilin lyase in cryptophytes. despite having originated from an organism using phycoerythrin as its accessory pigment, the protein still has the capacity to couple a chromophore group to the β-subunit of phycocyanin, indicating the functional universality of bilin lyases on the one hand and demonstrating the importance of nucleomorph-encoded cellular functions on the other.
