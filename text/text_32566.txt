BACKGROUND
vibrio cholerae, a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium belonging to the family vibrionaceae, induces the acute diarrheal disease cholera. cholera has pandemic properties and appears mainly in third world countries with estimated 3– <dig> million cases and more than  <dig>  deaths per year
 <cit> . the major pathogenic strains belong to the serogroups o <dig> and o <dig>  infections are treated by oral or intravenous rehydration therapy, which is complemented in severe cases with antibiotics to shorten the duration of the clinical symptoms and to reduce the spreading. long-term and extensive use of antibiotics has led to resistance development. a growing problem is the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic v. cholerae strains against which therapeutic options are more and more limited
 <cit> . due to this development the availability of novel therapeutic options is urgently needed.

in the present study we have developed a high-throughput screening  assay that utilizes a v. cholerae reporter strain constitutively expressing green fluorescence protein and screened approximately  <dig>  compounds from six different chemical structural groups in a growth inhibition assay. several active molecules were identified which are active in suppressing growth of v. cholerae in vitro. v. cholerae mutants resistant to the most potent molecule were generated. whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of the mutant to the wild type strain was carried out. the apparent target of the most active compound was identified to be the osmosensitive k+-channel sensor histidine kinase kdpd that apparently exerts certain essential function in this pathogen.

RESULTS
hts assay for inhibitors of v. cholerae viability
green fluorescence producing plasmid pg <dig> was electroporated into v. cholerae strain mo <dig> and the transformants were selected on lb agar plates containing kanamycin . transfer of the plasmid pg <dig> conferred green fluorescence phenotype in v. cholerae o <dig> strain mo <dig>  the screening assay was optimized in 96- and 384-well microtiter plates . to differentiate between active and non-active compounds and as controls for the functionality of the assay, ciprofloxacin  and dimethyl sulfoxide  were included on each plate. dmso had no growth reducing effect at concentrations up to 1%. the evaluation of the effect of compounds on the growth of strain mo <dig> pg <dig> was carried out after 24 h of incubation, with measurement of absorbance at 600 nm in combination with fluorescence determination . in the screening campaigns of the six different substance collections with  <dig>  compounds in total, z’-values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  with a mean of  <dig>  were obtained, which is an indication of a reliable performance of the assay
 <cit> .

the six groups of screening compounds consisted of: i) the commercially available lopac library ; ii) and iii) the emc  and cdi collections , which contain small organic molecules that were mainly generated by combinatorial synthesis; iv) the var collection , which is unique at the hzi and consists of small organic molecules that were synthesized by cooperating chemists; v) the nch collection , which is also unique at the hzi and consists of purified secondary metabolites from myxobacteria. it included potent agents with already known antimicrobial or antiproliferative activity, e.g. epothilon, which has been developed into a therapeutic agent against breast cancer
 <cit> ; and finally vi) collections of linear and cyclic peptides with a length of seven or eight d- or l-amino acids were investigated
 <cit> . the compounds were used in one defined concentration between  <dig> to 50 μm in the initial screening. an overview of the growth-reducing activities of the six different substance collections is shown in figure 
 <dig> and in table 
 <dig>  the threshold for active compounds was defined at a minimum growth reduction of 50% in comparison to the dmso control, which resulted in a suitable initial hit rate. the smallest of the six collections, the nch collection of  <dig> compounds, showed the most active molecules with  <dig>  hits per  <dig>  substances. several of these molecules displayed antibacterial activities that have been known before
 <cit> . the var library consists of molecules with predominantly unexplored activities and contained  <dig>  antibacterial compounds per  <dig>  molecules. with  <dig> hits this collection contained the highest number of antibacterial molecules in total.

in total  <dig> hits were identified in the initial screening campaign. these initial hits were reevaluated in different concentrations by using v. cholerae strains and several other gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. after these reevaluations, the number of active compounds was reduced to three most promising agents with the designations vz <dig>  vz <dig> and 1541– <dig>  the former two compounds are derived from the var library, the last one from the commercially available cdi library. the chemical structures are shown in figure 
 <dig> 

mic and mbc values of the most active substances
the two pathogenic v. cholerae o <dig> type stains n <dig> and nm06- <dig> were used to determine the mic and mbc values for the compounds vz <dig>  vz <dig> and 1541– <dig> . v. cholerae n <dig> belongs to biotype el tor which caused the seventh pandemic
 <cit>  and was isolated in  <dig>  v. cholerae nm06- <dig> was isolated in  <dig> in kolkata from a cholera patient and represents the altered el tor biotype. the active compounds inhibited growth of both strains equipotent at low micromolar concentrations with mic values of  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively. in order to obtain reliable data, bactericidal activities were determined after  <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours. all three compounds killed the bacteria at low micromolar concentrations, only slightly above the respective mic values . further nine v. cholerae strains belonging to the o <dig>  o <dig> and non o1/o <dig> serogroups   were testes with compound vz <dig>  which is active against all tested strains with mic values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm. overall vz <dig> was the most active substance.

the antibacterial specificity of the active substances was investigated with different gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, which are able to induce serious gastrointestinal infections in humans . apparently, the antimicrobial activity of the three substances was limited to v. cholerae, only compound 1541– <dig> also displayed a moderate activity against s. aureus with an mic of  <dig>  μm.

cytotoxicity determination via mtt-assay
in vitro cytotoxicity determination by mtt test with mammalian cells is one of the standard procedures for the evaluation of new active agents
 <cit> . the well established assay was carried out with the permanent mouse fibroblast cell line l <dig> according to a published procedure
 <cit>  with some modifications
 <cit> . in the assay cell viability is determined by the reduction of the yellow mtt - <dig> -diphenyltetrazoliumbromid) to the violet formazan by the action of er- and mitochondrial enzymes. concentrations of the active compounds vz <dig>  vz <dig> and 1541– <dig> from  <dig>  to 370 μm were used and effects on the fibroblasts were analyzed after 24 hours and 5 days of incubation. the ic <dig> values are shown in table 
 <dig>  the two most active compounds vz <dig> and vz <dig> showed cytotoxic  and anti-proliferative  ic <dig> values at low micromolar concentrations. compound 1541– <dig> is less cytotoxic, but has also a strong antiproliferative activity.

generation of resistant mutants against vz0825
mutants against vz <dig> were generated by selection of variants of the wild type strain nm06- <dig> that are able to grow on agar plates containing 8 μm vz <dig>  after one round of selection,  <dig> resistant mutants were picked and analyzed individually. they displayed 4– <dig> fold reduced sensitivities  against vz <dig> compared to the wild type strain. in order to obtain an indication if vz <dig> has a mode of action that is different from standard antimicrobials, eight established antibiotics against the major different antibacterial targets were tested with the resistant mutants. the addressed targets and their inhibitors were i) cell wall synthesis , ii) protein biosynthesis , iii) dna-replication , iv) dna-dependent rna polymerase , v) translation  and vi) synthesis of folic-acid .

the v. cholerae wild type strain nm06- <dig> and resistant mutants did not show differences in their mic values against all tested antibiotics , suggesting that vz <dig> has a mode of action that is different from the classical antibiotics.

target identification
this result initiated a further investigation of the mode of action of vz <dig> by the comparative genome sequence analysis approach. the method makes use of whole genome sequence analysis of resistant mutants that were generated against an active compound and the comparison of the genome of the wild type and the mutant strain
 <cit> . the genomes of the  <dig> resistant v. cholerae mutants were isolated, pooled and analyzed via paired-end sequencing. in parallel, the genome of the wild type strain from which the resistant mutants have been generated was also sequenced by the same method. the alignment and annotation of both probes was based on the published genome of v. cholerae strain n <dig> 
 <cit> . as shown in table 
 <dig>  approximately 98% and 94% of the fragments from the mutant-pool and the wild type, respectively, could be aligned. the alignment was carried out via the application of clc genomics workbench v.  <dig> . <dig> software. the algorithm to search for crucial distinctions were parameters like single nucleotide polymorphism  and deletion and insertion polymorphism , where one nucleotide was affected with a minimal mutation frequency of 30%.

reference genome came from v. cholerae strain n16961
 <cit> .

under those conditions, the comparison of the wild type and the pooled sequences from the mutants showed only one significant mutation, this was located at position  <dig> in gene vc_a <dig> and was present in about 30%  of the sequenced fragments. these mutants have the nucleobase thymine instead of cytosine on position  <dig>  the point mutation of this nucleobase leads to an exchange of threonine to methionine on position  <dig>  of the expressed protein.

the gene vc_a <dig>  is located on the small chromosome of v. cholerae and encodes a sensor histidine kinase, which is the homologous to kdpd of e. coli and is responsible for osmotic potassium regulation in the bacterial cell
 <cit> . in addition to the whole genome pool sequencing, the gene vc_a <dig>  of the  <dig> mutants was analyzed individually by pcr amplification.  <dig> of the  <dig> mutants, corresponding to  <dig> %, had the same mutation on reference position  <dig> of the gene kdpd that was identified in the whole genome pool sequencing. another four of the mutants showed point mutations at other positions of the kdpd gene .

in bold the major statistically significant mutation is highlighted.

sensitivity of strain nm06- <dig> t283m against vz0825
a strain containing the point mutation t283m in the kdpd gene was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. successful cloning was verified by a pcr amplification of the affected gene and the sequencing of the fragment. the mutant was selected on lb-agar plates containing vz <dig> at 16 μm concentration, which is 10-times higher than the mic of the wild type strain. a growth analysis with this strain was carried out in vz <dig> supplemented lb-medium and in t-medium with different potassium and sodium ion concentrations . overall, growth of the t283m mutant was much less effected by vz <dig> in comparison to the wild type strain. sensitivity of the t283m mutant against compounds vz <dig> and 1541– <dig> did not differ from the wild type strain nm06- <dig> .

attempts to construct a kdpd knockout mutant
for a further elucidation of the effect of vz <dig>  the construction of a v. cholerae kdpd knockout mutant was attempted. if kdpd is a major target of compound vz <dig>  the v. cholerae kdpd knockout mutant should be insensitive to the compound, unless the protein itself and its function are essential for the viability of the bacteria. the cloning procedure delivered the expected plasmid construct according to sequencing. the plasmid was successfully transformed into the e. coli strain s17- <dig>  according to the acquirement of ampicillin resistance, which is located on the plasmid pex18ap and also according to pcr amplification of the construct. the conjugation of the transformed e. coli with v. cholerae and the following selection on lb agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin  and km did not lead to clones with a deleted vc_a <dig> gene, even after several modifications of the protocol. a possible explanation is that the gene product kdpd is indeed essential for v. cholerae, in agreement with kdpd being a prime target of vz <dig> 

discussion
a hts assay for small molecule inhibitors of v. cholerae was developed and validated using a viability phenotype of v. cholerae that constitutively expresses green fluorescence. the assay is reliable, reproducible and simple to perform. during the development of the reporter strain, two reference strains of o <dig> serogroup belonging to biotypes o <dig>  and n <dig>  were included along with the o <dig> strain mo <dig>  the green fluorescence producing plasmid pg <dig> was electroporated into the three strains. during initial standardization experiments it was observed that the strain mo <dig> pg <dig> produced much greater level of green fluorescence as compared to other two strains . for this reason strain mo <dig> pg <dig> was used in the screening experiments.

a data bank search in scifinder for the most active compounds vz <dig> and vz <dig> did not reveal pre-described antibacterial activities of the compounds with structural similarities above 70%. compound 1541– <dig>  stemming from the commercial cdi collection, belongs to the group of styryl dyes, which have already in  <dig> been shown to possess antimicrobial effects against the plant pathogen xanthomonas oryza <cit> . the ic <dig> value for acute cytotoxicity of compound vz <dig> in an mtt test was approximately 17-times higher than its mic value. for vz <dig>  both ic <dig> and mic values were about equal. for compound 1541– <dig> the ic <dig> value for cytotoxicity was approximately 27-times higher than the mic value. although the identified compounds exhibited antimicrobial activities at low concentrations, the toxicities render them unsuitable for direct clinical application. thus, the compounds may serve as pharmaceutical leads and modifications via the methods of medicinal chemistry may lead to better properties.

the elucidation of the mode of action of new antimicrobials can be a tedious and time consuming effort and can require the application of a variety of biochemical and molecular methods
 <cit> . due to the advances in genome sequencing instrumentation and methodology, an innovative new option has become available recently. it employs genomic sequence comparison of resistant mutants with wild type strains and has been successfully applied for target identification in a limited number of previous investigations by other researchers
 <cit> . as we have used nm06- <dig> for the evaluation of the active compounds, we have used the same strain to create resistant mutants against vz <dig>  the v. cholerae strain nm06- <dig> was isolated from hospitalized diarrhea cases during  <dig> at kolkata, india. this strain along with other v. cholerae strains isolated during  <dig> was studied for the expression of cholera toxin  and it was identified that nm06- <dig> is capable of producing a higher amount of ct in vitro compared to other strains and to reference v. cholerae o <dig> el tor strain n <dig>  based on the high virulence expression, this strain was selected for our investigations. clinical v. cholerae o <dig> strains isolated at kolkata during and after  <dig> belonged to altered el tor biotypes
 <cit> . thus it can be considered that strain nm06- <dig> represents the altered v. cholerae el tor biotype, which is still the prevailing type among cholera cases.

the generation of mutants that were resistant against vz <dig> was straightforward in this study by plating the wild type strain on agar plates containing the active compound at 5-times the mic value of the wild type. the successful generation of resistant mutants with only one passage indicates a single essential molecular target of vz <dig>  the aligned sequences of the wild type genome and the mutant genome pool were compared with each other. for the identification of significant mutations the minimal frequency in the mutant genome pool was defined at 30%. a lower frequency would deliver too many non-relevant mutations. in the genome pool of the  <dig> resistant mutants only the gene with the code number vc_a <dig>  which corresponds to the homologue kdpd in e.coli, showed a significant mutation under the chosen parameters with frequency of  <dig> %. the sequencing of the  <dig> resistant mutants showed, that  <dig> of them  possess this particular modification. the mutated nucleobase is the second base of the corresponding codon and causes an exchange of the amino acid threonin by methionine in the expressed protein. another four mutants also possess point mutations at other positions of the gene . all of those mutations lead to an exchange of one particular amino acid in the expressed protein, two of them which are located in the n-region  lead to the exchange of glutamic acid  <dig> to lysine or glycin, respectively . thus,  <dig> of  <dig> mutants possess a mutation in the kdpd gene.

a comparison of known protein domains in the database pfam protein families
 <cit>  resulted in the localization of the affected amino acid in the dimerization/phosphor acceptor domain. histidine kinase dimers are formed by parallel association of two domains creating 4-helix bundles; usually these domains contain a conserved histidine residue and are activated via trans-autophosphorylation by the catalytic domain
 <cit> . they subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to the aspartic acid acceptor residue of a response regulator protein. based on the comparison of conserved regions in a number of bacterial histidine kinases
 <cit> , the localization could be specified more precisely between the h–region and the n-region . the h-region is the most variable sequence of histidine kinases in bacteria and contains the histidine that is phosphorylated in the signal transduction process. the n-region shuttles the gamma-phosphate from atp to the histidine residue. the mutated amino acid is localized between the conserved h- and n-region  and thus in a part of the protein that shows high interspecies variation
 <cit> , which could explain the specificity of vz <dig> against v. cholerae.

in the two-component system of signal transduction, the histidine kinase transfers the signal to a response regulator. the v. cholerae protein vc_a <dig> is the homolog of kdpd in e. coli, the response regulator of which is kdpe
 <cit> . the signal transduction system kdpabc, regulated by kdpd and kdpe, is part of the osmoregulation machinery in bacteria
 <cit> . compound vz <dig> may exert its mode of action by binding to the histidine kinase kdpd and thereby inhibiting signal transduction. this would lead to a deficient uptake of potassium. if this mechanism leads to the observed reduction of bacterial viability remains to be elucidated.

due to a lack of specific information about the potassium regulation in v. cholerae, we compared our findings with results that have been obtained with e. coli. e. coli possesses in addition to the kdpabc potassium regulatory system several further k+ dependent signal transduction systems. the k+ regulatory systems trk and kup are active at physiological k+ concentrations
 <cit> . the expression of kdpd and consequently of the kdpabc system in e. coli is induced at low potassium concentrations 
 <cit> . in e. coli kdpd is not essential at a potassium concentration >115 mm, as mutants with truncated forms of kdpd are viable under these conditions, but in media with <15 mm k+ those strains do not grow
 <cit> . v. cholerae also possesses these three potassium regulatory systems for the adaptation to changing osmotic conditions
 <cit> .

the v. cholerae mutant strain t283m grows well in media with high and low k+ and na+ concentrations in absence of vz <dig> as shown in figure 
 <dig>  even at 4 mm k+ growth is not diminished. this figure also shows the difference between the tolerance of the wild type and the t283m strain against vz <dig>  our findings that t283m grows well in k+ reduced medium indicates that the inhibition of kdpd may have profound influence on some other, hitherto undefined, regulatory function of this protein in v. cholerae. the influence of vz <dig> on kdpd may appear in different ways, e.g. reducing the binding of atp to the histidine kinase, inhibiting the transfer of gamma-phosphate to the histidine residue, or to the asparagine residue of the response regulator. like other histidine kinases kdpd also has phosphatase activity
 <cit> , which may be disturbed by vz <dig>  the mutated amino acid on position  <dig> is located between the h-region and n-region. mutations that alter this motif, which is termed the x-region, have been shown to alter the conformation of the histidine kinase envz and significantly reduce its phosphatase activity
 <cit> . envz is a membrane receptor kinase-phosphatase, which modulates porin expression in e. coli in response to medium osmolarity. it shares its basic scheme of signal transduction with many other sensor-kinases
 <cit> .

if kdpd is the major target of compound vz <dig>  the deletion construct Δkdpd should be insensitive to the substance in media with physiological k+ concentration – provided that it is still viable. the construction of the required plasmid for the generation of this construct, its transformation into e. coli s17- <dig> and the conjugation from e. coli into v. cholerae were successful in this study, but several attempts to induce the homolog recombination within v. cholerae nm06- <dig> failed. none of the analyzed clones showed a loss of the kdpd gene. the apparent growth reducing effect of vz <dig> and its targeting of kdpd in v. cholerae suggests a more important role of kdpd in v. cholerae than in e. coli. further experiments are required in order to corroborate the effect of vz <dig> on kdpd, like functional assays with the expressed protein, in which the kinase- and phosphatase activities of the wild type and mutated forms in the presence of vz <dig> are compared. it would also be desirable to carry out expression profiling of the transcriptome of vz <dig> sensitive and resistant v. cholerae strains. this procedure could help to determine how relevant the expression of kdpd in v. cholerae is and whether the expression of other genes is reduced or induced in the resistant strains.

CONCLUSIONS
in a high-troughput screening assay with  <dig>  compounds the synthetic small molecule vz <dig> was identified as the most active antibacterial substance against v. cholerae with an mic of  <dig>  μm and an mbc of  <dig>  μm. whole genome sequencing was carried out with resistant mutants and the two-component histidine kinase kdpd was identified as the prime target of the substance. further investigations should address the inhibitory mechanism in more detail and corroborate on the possibility of an essential function of kdpd in v. cholerae. histidine kinase inhibitors are in principal promising antimicrobial drug candidates
 <cit>  and compounds like vz <dig> may lead to new treatment options.
