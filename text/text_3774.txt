BACKGROUND
wheat is one of the three most important crops in the world due to its value as a major food source and its unique suitability to bread production. the protein composition of wheat grain is the key to bread baking quality. wheat grain proteins are classified into non-prolamins, including albumins and globulins, and prolamins including gliadins and glutenins 
 <cit> . albumins and globulins are more abundant in essential amino acids such as lysine, tryptophan and methionine that are very important for human health. prolamins are the major storage proteins and determine the viscoelasticity of dough. understanding protein synthesis and regulation during grain development is of fundamental importance for targeting wheat quality by conventional breeding or genetic engineering to specific end-uses.

the development of wheat grain involves three distinct phases: cell division and differentiation, grain filling, and desiccation/maturation 
 <cit> . in recent years, studies on transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have provided insights into the mechanism of reserve accumulation during wheat grain development. for instance, using affymetrix wheat genechip oligonucleotide arrays,  <dig>  transcripts showed significant differential regulation in developing caryopses of hexaploid wheat cv. hereward between  <dig> and 42 days after anthesis 
 <cit> . transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches have been used to investigate the impacts of nitrogen  and sulphur  deficiency on n and s remobilization during grain filling in winter wheat 
 <cit> . it has been noted, however, that the accumulated amounts of a large proportion of proteins are often poorly correlated with their corresponding mrnas in expression profiles 
 <cit>  and hence direct proteome approaches can be more valuable in monitoring developmental profiles. two-dimensional electrophoresis  and mass spectrometry  proteomic approaches provide the tools for the monitoring the dynamic expression profiles of proteins during seed development, and have been widely used in different plant species such as arabidopsis <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , soybean 
 <cit> , maize 
 <cit>  and rice 
 <cit> . considerable work on wheat grain proteomics has been carried out in different wheat varieties 
 <cit> , endosperm and endosperm amyloplasts 
 <cit> , kernel aleurone and peripheral layers 
 <cit> , and grain storage proteins 
 <cit> . recent work has focused on proteomic analysis of different grain developing stages, such as six grain developmental stages in winter wheat variety récital 
 <cit> , five developmental stages in jing  <dig> and sunstate at 
 <cit> , four developmental stages in two near-isogenic lines of bread wheat cv. falcon 
 <cit> , four developmental stages in two spring wheat varieties ningchun  <dig> and chinese spring under drought stress 
 <cit> . although these studies provided valuable information, the biochemical processes important for wheat grain development still require research because this species has a much larger genome and a more complex proteome than model plants such as arabidopsis and rice.

a complex gene network regulates protein expression during grain development 
 <cit> . various post-translational modifications of proteins  occur as grains develop and mature. the poor association between transcription  and translation  levels indicates the importance of ptms. protein phosphorylation, as an important ptm and a transient and reversible modification, plays a crucial role in signaling and regulation of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis 
 <cit> . for example, phosphorylation in wheat amyloplasts is capable of regulating starch branching enzyme activity and protein–protein interactions 
 <cit> . among the many strategies for studying protein phosphorylation, a powerful way for directly identifying phosphorylated proteins is to separate phosphoproteins by 2-de and to stain with phosphospecific dyes such as pro-q diamond phosphoprotein staining followed by tandem mass spectrometry analyses 
 <cit> .

in the present work, we conducted an investigation on proteome characterization of developing grains in two bread wheat cultivars  with different gluten quality properties, by 2-de and maldi-tof/tof-ms. jimai  <dig> has high yield and superior gluten quality, whereas zhoumai  <dig> has poor gluten quality and higher yield 
 <cit> . in the past ten years, both cultivars were widely cultivated in the main wheat areas of china. our results provide a comprehensive view of proteome characterization during grain development in different wheat genotypes.

RESULTS
grain development and sem observations
in general, grain size and weight in both jimai  <dig> and zhoumai  <dig> increased gradually from flowering to maturity, but their development rates and grain sizes were different . zhoumai  <dig> had a larger grain size and higher grain weight than jimai  <dig> at all grain developmental stages except the first. sem observations on both cultivars indicated that starch granules accumulated continuously until grain maturity . as previously observed 
 <cit> , a  and b  starch granules appeared at  <dig> dpa  and  <dig> dpa , respectively. the size of a granules as well as grain weight increased rapidly from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa , but b granules grew only slowly from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. this indicated that the period 11– <dig> dpa was a key stage for grain starch synthesis and accumulation.

identification, classification and localization of differentially accumulated proteins during grain development in the two cultivars
grain proteins extracted at the five developmental stages in the two cultivars were separated by 2-de with broad-range  ipg strips. the proteome profiles were generally similar in both cultivars at all five stages  . most of the proteins on the 2-de gels were distributed in the ph 3– <dig> range during the earlier  development stages. the numbers of basic proteins increased considerably from stage iii, especially in the last stage. in total,  <dig> protein spots showed more than two fold differences in abundance, of which  <dig> representing  <dig> unique proteins were identified by maldi-tof/tof-ms . their peptide sequences are listed in additional file

according to their functions, the identified proteins were classified into several main groups, including carbohydrate metabolism , stress/defense , storage proteins , protein synthesis/assembly/degradation , transcription/translation , nitrogen metabolism  and signal transduction  as shown as in figure 
 <dig>  more than 80% were identified as enzymes. proteins related to carbohydrate metabolism contained five subcategories: glycolysis , tca pathway , lipid and sterol metabolism , starch metabolism  and alcoholic fermentation .

among the differentially accumulated proteins,  <dig> different kinds were represented by two or more spots, and more than  <dig> isoforms were identified with different molecular masses or isoelectric points, each having two or three protein spots located at different positions on the same gel , such as phosphoglycerate mutase , glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase , triticin , alpha-amylase inhibitor cm <dig> subunit , monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor , class ii chitinase  and peroxidase  <dig> . some of these isoforms might have resulted from certain ptms such as phosphorylation.

in order to confirm the presence of phosphorylated proteins with isoforms, grain proteins at stage v were separated by 2-de and then subjected to pro-q diamond staining  to detect putative phosphorylated proteins. many spots stained in different intensities on the gels, indicating they were phosphorylated . sixteen spots with intense signals in both cultivars were identified by maldi-tof/tof-ms ; their peptide sequences are listed in additional file

phosphorylated modification sites on serine, threonine and tyrosine were predicted by netphos  <dig>  serve 
 <cit> . generally, the predicted results were in accordance with those from pro-q diamond dye staining . for example, class ii chitinase  was predicted to possess  <dig> serine,  <dig> threonine and  <dig> tyrosine phosphorylated modification sites, whereas peroxidase  <dig>  had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> phosphorylated modification sites of serine, threonine and tyrosine, respectively. phosphorylated protein staining showed that both proteins had strong staining signals .

through sub-cellular localization of the identified proteins during grain development, a large number of proteins appeared to locate in the cytosol . most of the identified enzymes with higher abundance, and involved in glycolysis-the tca pathway-nitrogen metabolism were located in the cytosol especially during the first two stages. until stage iii many storage proteins appeared on the endoplasmic reticulum . stress-related proteins were mainly located in the plastids and were extracellular at all development stages. additionally, some enzymes involved in starch synthesis also appeared in plastids during the early development stages.

protein expression profiles during grain development
the expression profiles of the  <dig> protein spots were investigated by hierarchical cluster analysis . five main expression patterns  were present and clearly reflected three distinct grain development phases: differentiation , grain filling  and desiccation/maturation  as shown in figure 
 <dig> and 
 <dig> 

expression pattern a included  <dig> spots in jimai  <dig> and  <dig> in zhoumai  <dig> exhibiting down-regulated modes during grain development. for example, triticin precursor  was highly accumulated in the first two stages but was down-regulated at grain filling and maturity. most of the proteins involved in the tca pathway and glycolysis showed this expression pattern, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase nadp-dependent and its precursor , and phosphoglycerate mutase . preprotein of glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase  also displayed this pattern in both cultivars.

expression pattern b included the largest proportion of identified proteins and showed up-regulated expression, especially during the late grain development stages. totals of  <dig> spots in jimai  <dig> and  <dig> in zhoumai  <dig> were in this expression group, which contained most of the storage proteins, many stress/defense-related proteins and two enzymes involved in alcoholic fermentation. in general, storage proteins including globulins , gliadins  and glutenins , triticins  and avenin-like protein  accumulated significantly at the later developmental stages, but only had trace expression levels during the earlier developmental stages in both cultivars. the same responses also occurred for formate dehydrogenase  involved in alcoholic fermentation, and class ii chitinase  involved in stress/defense pathways. three spots  were identified as peroxidase  <dig>  of which  <dig> displayed b expression pattern in both cultivars.

expression pattern c was the second largest group of identified proteins, represented by  <dig> spots in jimai  <dig> and  <dig> in zhoumai  <dig>  many of which included glycolysis and stress/defence-related proteins and showed up-regulated expression at the early development stages, and were then down-regulated with advancement of grain filling and maturity. representative proteins involved in this expression group were phosphoglucomutase  and glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase  related to starch synthesis.

expression pattern d, unlike pattern c, displayed a down to up-regulated expression trend. only spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> representing two proteins  showed this pattern. the remaining two spots  in jimai  <dig> and three  in zhoumai  <dig> accumulated a complicated pattern e that fluctuated during gain development .

comparative proteome characterization in jimai  <dig> and zhoumai  <dig> during grain development
comparative proteomic analysis demonstrated a considerable proteome expression difference between jimai  <dig> and zhoumai  <dig> during grain development. a total of  <dig> protein spots co-accumulated in both wheat cultivars, but with different expression patterns . for example, starch-rating enzyme glucose-1-phosphate adenyl-transferase  displayed a expression patterns in jimai  <dig>  but c patterns in zhoumai  <dig>  spots  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as peroxidase i that showed expression pattern c in jimai  <dig>  and patterns a and b in zhoumai  <dig>  in addition, 27 k protein  and superoxide dismutase  gradually accumulated in zhoumai  <dig>  but showed little change in jimai  <dig> during all five stages.

protein spots with two fold changes, or greater, in abundance at particular times between the two cultivars were considered to be cultivar-different proteins. twenty seven spots showed cultivar-different during the five development stages and they were mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, stress/defense, protein storage and transcription/translation. among them, spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  only accumulated in jimai  <dig>  but were not detected in zhoumai  <dig> when subjected to imagemaster™ 2d platinum software analysis. another two spots,  <dig> and  <dig> , only accumulated in zhoumai  <dig>  in the remaining protein spots,  <dig> accumulated in higher abundance in jimai  <dig> than in zhoumai  <dig>  whereas  <dig> were more abundantly accumulated in zhoumai  <dig>  for example, important proteins displaying higher levels of expression in jimai  <dig> than in zhoumai  <dig> included isocitrate dehydrogenase nadp-dependent , triticin precursor , lmw-s glutenin subunit , and replication factor c like protein  as shown in figure 
 <dig>  some proteins displayed higher expression abundances in zhoumai  <dig> than in jimai  <dig>  for example, phosphoglucomutase .

transcriptional expression analysis by qrt-pcr
since wheat grains in stage v were approaching maturity and the reference gene accumulated unstably, the transcriptional expression profiles of ten representative genes from stages i to iv were investigated by qrt-pcr with specific primers . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the transcriptional expression patterns of only four protein genes  in both cultivars and two genes  in zhoumai  <dig> were consistent with their protein expression models. the remaining protein genes showed poor consistency between their transcriptional and translational levels. interestingly, alpha-amylase inhibitor was shown to be phosphorylated when stained by pro-q diamond dye , a feature that might be responsible for lower consistency between transcriptional and translational expression patterns.

discussion
in this study samples were collected during grain development and categorized according to cumulative average daily temperatures to avoid the effects of temperature on plant growth and development 
 <cit> . proteome expression profiles during five grain development stages in two bread wheat cultivars were investigated by 2-de and maldi-tof/tof-ms. the results revealed key molecular characteristics of grain development and provided important insights on crucial proteins and their expression profiles during specific developmental phases.

metabolism and energy supply
the respiratory pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid  cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain are essential for energy provision in a wide range of cellular functions 
 <cit> . we identified  <dig> spots representing  <dig> unique proteins related to the tca cycle, including nad-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase  and nad-idh precursor . nad-idh, present in mitochondria, is a key enzyme in the tca cycle and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate towards 2-oxoglutarate, nadh, and co <dig>  the tca cycle-related proteins all showed high expression levels from  <dig> to  <dig> dap , and then underwent steep decreases. this implies that the tca cycle is very active during the early grain development stages, mainly providing energy for grain development. nad-idh expression was higher in jimai  <dig> than in zhoumai  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> dap, especially at  <dig> dpa. however, some other energy-related enzymes were accumulated as cultivar-different spots, such as phosphoglucomutase , which were highly accumulated in zhoumai  <dig>  these differential expressions in energy metabolism in different genotypes were possibly related to different cultivar performances.

for glycolysis  <dig> spots representing  <dig> unique proteins were identified. except for a few spots such as pgm , the vast majority of glycolysis-related proteins showed simultaneous peaks in expression around  <dig> dpa  in both cultivars. this stage is consistent with cell differentiation and the beginning of dry matter accumulation during which lots of energy is needed 
 <cit> . at the same time, b-type starch granules began to form and enlarge , resulting in decreased o <dig> availability and increased energy need. therefore, glycolysis becomes a highly significant source of energy for grain filling, which involves packaging of proteins as well as starch 
 <cit> . pgm was accumulated at higher levels during early grain development, and showed a peak at  <dig> dap , before decreasing to a lower constant level. this coincided with an intensive starch synthesis stage 
 <cit> . previous reports demonstrated that pgm, as a phosphorylated protein, catalyses the bidirectional interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate  and glucose 6-phosphate  and cytosolic pgm isoforms may play an important role in the partitioning of carbon between the starch synthetic  and glycolytic  pathways in plant tissues 
 <cit> . phosphorylation of starch-related enzymes in wheat and maize, such as gbss, beiib, ssiia and starch phosphorylase appeared to play important roles in synthesis and accumulation, and protein phosphorylation in wheat amyloplasts could regulate starch branching enzyme activity and protein–protein interactions 
 <cit> . our results also showed that pgm was a phosphorylated protein by pro-q diamond dye detection , indicating its importance in glycolysis and energy provision for starch synthesis. additionally, the expression abundance of pgm was higher in zhoumai  <dig> than jimai  <dig> during the early grain development stages , and this might be partly responsible for greater grain size and higher yield of zhoumai  <dig> than jimai  <dig> 

nucleoside diphosphate kinase  is a ubiquitous enzyme functioning in intracellular distribution of terminal phosphate bond energy among the various nucleotides used in synthesis pathways and regulatory functions in cells 
 <cit> . plant ndpks are also involved in signal transduction, differentiation and development 
 <cit> . our results showed that ndpk was gradually down-regulated during grain development in both wheat cultivars , and therefore might play an important role in signal regulation for grain development.

glycolysis and the tca cycle not only provide energy and intermediates for synthesis of metabolites, but their metabolite concentration gradients may also act as signals for the onset of the seed maturation phase and its regulation 
 <cit> . during the late development stages of wheat grains, the alcoholic fermentation pathway could contribute supplementary energy in anaerobic conditions due to an energy deficit from glycolysis and the tca cycle. in addition, formate dehydrogenase showed increased expression at stage iii  and further increased during the late grain filling and desiccation stages. this is consistent with the transition from cell growth and differentiation to starch synthesis. a switch from central carbon metabolism to alcoholic fermentation may be important for starch synthesis and accumulation during grain development 
 <cit> .

starch synthesis
grain yield is largely determined by starch accumulation during the grain filling phase in cereals 
 <cit> . starch biosynthesis is initiated with a substrate of adp-glucose formed by glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase  from glucose-l-phosphate. agpase, located in plastids, is a major rate-limiting enzyme in seed starch biosynthesis 
 <cit> . our results demonstrated that glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase large subunits  showed the highest expression levels from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa , and was then down-regulated to trace levels at grain desiccation. the expression pattern closely matched large increases in both starch content and grain weight. plastid agpase activity maintains higher levels from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and reaches a peak around  <dig> dpa, before declining at the later stages of endosperm development 
 <cit> . by coincidence adp-glucose pyrophosophorylase preprotein , the precursor of agpase in plastids, showed peak expression at 147ocd , and was then down-regulated simultaneously in both cultivars. the increase in agpase could result in reduced adp-glucose pyrophosophorylase preprotein during grain development.

stress and defense
the accumulation of starch and storage proteins was accompanied by the expression of various α-amylase inhibitors, which are mainly located in plastids or in extracellular spaces. alpha-amylase inhibitors play important roles in protecting starch and protein reserves in the endosperm against degradation, particularly that caused by biotic stresses such as insect attack 
 <cit> . we identified  <dig> α-amylase inhibitors  and all accumulated at low levels during early grain development, but were rapidly up-regulated from the starch synthesis to grain desiccation stages in both wheat cultivars, consistent with the accumulation patterns of starch and storage proteins during late grain development. twenty-one spots were identified as α-amylase inhibitors, predominant proteins in wheat flour 
 <cit> . probably due to protein ptms, the up-regulation of some α-amylase inhibitors and the down-regulation of other α-amylase inhibitors may reflect their different roles in high temperature treatments or drought stress 
 <cit> .

chitinases, mainly located extracellularly, catalyse the hydrolytic cleavage of the β- <dig>  4-glycoside bonds present in biopolymers of n-acetylglucosamine in chitin, a major component of cell walls in fungi. some reports showed that transgenic wheat expressing a barley chitinase exhibit enhanced resistance against powdery mildew, leaf rust and fusarium head blight 
 <cit> . in our study, five protein spots were identified as class ii chitinases; all exhibited trace expression levels during early grain development, but accumulated during grain filling in both cultivars. chitinases  with different molecular weights or isoelectric points were also shown to be phosphorylated, consistent with predictions from netphos  <dig>  serve and pro-q, using diamond dye staining . many isoforms of chitinase also appeared in other plant species such as vicia faba, pisum sativum, hordeum vulgare, zea mays and glycine max <cit> . protein modifications resulting from phosphorylation have been associated with biotic and abiotic stresses such as light, pathogen invasion, hormones, temperature stresses, and nutrient deficiencies 
 <cit> . transient phosphorylated modifications of chitinases might play important roles in different stress/defense and/or detoxification mechanisms through regulation of their localization and enzyme activities.

peroxidases are one kind of antioxidant enzymes involved in defense. some investigations showed that peroxidase activity in whole wheat grains varied with development stage 
 <cit> . plant tissues typically contain several peroxidase isoforms varying in isoelectric point values from acidic to basic 
 <cit> . in our work, three spots  were simultaneously identified as peroxidase  <dig> with the same molecular mass but different isoelectric points. spots  <dig> and  <dig> were both phosphorylated . interestingly, these peroxidases exhibited different expression patterns, where spot  <dig> was highly abundant during phases i and ii but spots  <dig> and  <dig> showed only trace expression at these stages. spots  <dig> and  <dig> were sharply up-regulated during the following grain filling phases. differences in peroxidase activity were also observed in developing pea seedlings 
 <cit> . this suggests that peroxidase  <dig> may be involved in different functions through different expression patterns or phosphorylated modification. another antioxidant enzyme is superoxide dismutase, catalyzing the first step in the active oxygen species scavenging system 
 <cit> . this enzyme was up-regulated gradually in zhoumai  <dig> whereas it maintained a stable expression level in jimai  <dig> during grain development, demonstrating a significant differential expression pattern in different wheat genotypes.

storage proteins and nitrogen metabolism
storage proteins are major components of wheat gluten and are closely related to processing quality. in the current study five kinds of storage proteins identified during grain development included triticins, globulins, avenin-like proteins, γ-gliadins and lmw-s glutenin subunits. four γ-gliadins  were initiated from  <dig> dpa , and then sharply up-regulated at  <dig> dpa  and remained at maximum levels until grain maturity. however, globulins , avenin-like protein  and two kinds of lmw-s glutenin subunits  were accumulated at the later developmental stages in both wheat cultivars. the abundance of the two lmw-s glutenin subunits was higher in jimai  <dig> than in zhoumai  <dig> at maturity, a feature possibly related to the superior gluten quality of jimai  <dig> 

triticin, a minor storage protein in the starchy endosperm of wheat, is considered to be nutritionally rich due to the presence of a unique lysine-rich decapeptide repeat motif 
 <cit> . it is also thought to be involved in determination of flour quality because of the thiol disulfide interchange which takes place during grain maturation when subjected to dehydration stress 
 <cit> . our results showed that the expression of triticins began at  <dig> dpa  and reached a maximum that lasted until maturity in both cultivars. previous work showed that triticins were more highly accumulated in superior quality wheat varieties than in lower quality genotypes 
 <cit> . in our study, triticin  showed a slightly higher expression in jimai  <dig> than in zhoumai  <dig> . conversely to triticin expression, triticin precursor underwent a down-regulated expression pattern in both cultivars, indicating that triticin precursor was probably consumed and converted to the accumulating triticin during grain filling. triticin precursor also accumulated at a higher level in jimai  <dig> than in zhoumai  <dig> during early grain development, especially at  <dig> dpa  . this might relate to the superior quality of jimai  <dig>  one triticin spot was phosphorylated . a recent report also identified seven protein spots from white flour of cv butte  <dig> as triticin that had undergone post-translational modifications 
 <cit> .

generally, biosynthesis of seed storage protein is dependent on amino acid synthesis and transport of nitrogen metabolism 
 <cit> . amino acids for protein synthesis are imported from leaves and stems by the phloem to the endosperm cavity 
 <cit> . in our study, many aminotransferases of amino-acids such as aspartate, alanine and serine as well as one putative methionine synthase were identified. these enzymes were abundant pre-storage phase from flowering to  <dig> dpa  and then declined with grain maturity in both wheat cultivars.

other functional proteins
replication factor c , composed of one large subunit and four small subunits, is an important factor involved in dna replication and repair mechanisms as well as cell proliferation 
 <cit> . rfc mediates genomic stability and transcriptional gene silencing in arabidopsis 
 <cit> . they express strongly in proliferating tissues, such as shoot apical meristems  and developing grain 
 <cit> . in the present study, rfc-like protein  accumulated in highest abundance at  <dig> dpa , and then displayed down-regulated expression during subsequent grain development stages in jimai  <dig>  whereas it showed peak expression at  <dig> dpa  in zhoumai  <dig>  demonstrating its expression differences in different genotypes. tri-snrnp-specific 27 k protein is potentially involved in non-snrnp splicing factors-medicated protein/protein interactions and can be phosphorylated in vitro to modulate pre-mrna splicing at the transcriptional level 
 <cit> . we identified  <dig> spots as 27 k proteins, of which  <dig>  were up-regulated during grain development in both cultivars. the remaining spot  accumulated gradually in zhoumai  <dig>  whereas there was little change in jimai  <dig> throughout grain development. wrky is a relatively complex transcription factor family involved in transcriptional regulation and many other plant processes including responses to biotic and abiotic stresses 
 <cit> . in our work wrky transcription factor was continuously up-regulated in both wheat cultivars until grain maturity, indicating importance during the grain development process.

CONCLUSIONS
we used proteomic approaches to characterize protein accumulation during grain development in chinese bread wheat cultivars jimai  <dig> and zhoumai  <dig>  which differ in gluten quality. among  <dig> differentially accumulated protein spots and  <dig> unique proteins, there were five main expression patterns, and a considerable number of proteome expression differences occurred between the two cultivars. some cultivar-different protein spots in jimai  <dig> accumulated in higher abundance than in zhoumai  <dig>  such as triticin precursor and lmw-s glutenin subunit, might be related to superior gluten quality. in addition, some proteins with different isoforms in developing grains appeared to be phosphorylated, a feature that which could play important roles in wheat grain development, and possibly lead to expression differences between proteins and their mrna. our results provide new insights into proteome characterization during grain development in different wheat genotypes.
