BACKGROUND
silage maize  is of increasing importance  <cit>  as predominantly used biogas substrate in germany  <cit> . sowing in early summer after cereals leads to an exposure of the seedlings to high temperature and potentially heat stress  <cit> . temperate maize genotypes are severely damaged when temperature rises over an optimum level  <cit>  and yields of maize are heavily reduced at temperatures above 30°c, which was shown for us maize germplasm  <cit> . besides the seedling stage, heat stress during flowering and corn filling as well has severe impacts on maize cultivation  <cit> .

climate predictions suggest that the mean global temperature and variance of the temperature are expected to increase in the future  <cit> . this will cause globally in the future an occurrence of heat waves with a higher frequency and duration than observed today  <cit> . this in turn leads in the future to an increase of the duration and intensity of heat stress situations in cropping systems.

in response to heat stress, plants show various symptoms, including scorching  of leaves as well as growth inhibition and reduction of yield  <cit> , which also has been reported for maize in temperate regions  <cit> . improving maize genotypes to be able to cope with high temperatures leads to high reduction of yield losses due to climate change  <cit> . in this respect, the development of heat tolerant varieties is a major challenge for plant scientists and is of crucial importance for future maize cropping in temperate regions. the latter can be facilitated by gaining knowledge of the molecular basis of heat response and tolerance in maize. furthermore, knowledge on the heat tolerance of european flint and dent lines is rare and highly valuable for plant breeding.

recently, the understanding of the molecular response upon heat stress in plants in general and in maize in particular has increased . the primarily major adverse effects of heat stress on plants are the decreased stability of membranes  <cit>  and proteins, the excessive production of reactive oxygen species, a loss of cellular water, and an alteration of enzymatic reactions  <cit> . these changes lead especially to oxidative stress, impairment of metabolite synthesis, disturbed osmotic potential, and cell organization, to leaf burning, premature senescence, reduced growth, and cell death  <cit> . to cope with these adverse effects, plants developed several heat tolerance mechanisms . they include the alteration of signaling cascades and transcriptional control, increasing production of antioxidants  <cit>  and osmoprotectants, as well as the expression of stress proteins  <cit> , especially heat shock proteins. we hypothesize that increasing heat stress is followed by a strong common transcriptomic response across different maize genotypes and that, however, certain genes exist, which are differentially regulated between genotypes with different heat tolerance.

despite the high number of studies examining the molecular response of plants upon heat stress, most of the studies focused on the heat response of one or few genotypes and, thus, results are based on a narrow genetic background. furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, all previous studies compared one standard condition with one heat level, but information about the behaviour of genotypes across a gradient of heat conditions is missing.

the objectives of this study were to  assess phenotypic variation for heat tolerance of temperate european flint and dent maize inbred lines,  investigate the transcriptomic response of temperate maize to linearly increasing heat levels and,  identify genes associated with heat tolerance in a set of genotypes with contrasting heat tolerance behaviour.

methods
plant material
this study was based on four dent  and four flint  maize inbred lines from the university of hohenheim, germany. these inbreds have been selected from an experiment studying the phenotypic reaction of  <dig> european maize inbreds upon low and high temperature conditions during seedling stage  <cit> . out of this set, we selected four heat tolerant  and four heat susceptible   inbreds for our study.

phenotypic evaluation
experimental conditions and assessed traits
seeds were sown in soil ) in single pots  with n= <dig> replications. the experimental design was a randomized complete block design. the plants were grown at 25°c during a 16h light period and at 20°c during a 8h dark period for a total of three weeks in a walk-in growth chamber . relative humidity was set to 60%. photosynthetic active radiation, emitted by fluorescent tubes, was between  <dig> -  <dig> μmol m−2s− <dig> in the canopy of the plants to avoid any type of radiation stress, which could be observed with higher light intensities, especially for the flint germplasm of our study. watering was conducted every morning to avoid drought stress.

leaf growth rate was calculated as follows: the length of the fourth leaf from the shoot base to the leaf tip was measured daily for a period of three days during the stage of linear growth. the slope of a linear trendline of leaf length measurements vs. time represented the leaf growth rate. twenty days after sowing, leaf greenness  was assessed as the average value of four readings on the leaf blade of the latest fully developed leaf. further, the leaf temperature was assessed with an infrared thermometer . the plant height from the shoot base to the point where the youngest leaf detached from the older leaf’s sheath and the number of leaves per plant with visible leaf ligule were recorded. a total of  <dig> days after sowing, shoot dry weight was determined. the above outlined experiment was repeated at two further heat levels, where the temperature was increased after six days to induce heat stress. the mild heat level was at 32°c at day and 27°c at night, the strong heat level was at 38°c at day and 33°c at night. the studied heat levels were chosen such that similar levels of heat stress can be expected in field experiments in europe.

data analysis
adjusted entry means for each inbred line - trait - heat level combination were calculated as best linear unbiased estimates using the mixed model   yik=μ+ii+rk+eik, 

separately for each heat level, where yik was the observed value for the ith inbred in the kth replication, μ the general mean ii the effect of the ith inbred line, rk the effect of the kth replication, and eik the residual error. the replications can be seen as a sample of total number of possible replications and, thus, rk was considered as random factor. the inbred lines were selected specifically for this project and, thus, ii was considered as a fixed effect.

a principal component  analysis of the adjusted means of the six traits of the eight inbred lines at three heat levels was performed to characterize the overall reaction of the inbred lines at different heat levels. correlations between the trait means and the first pc  of the  <dig> inbred line - heat level combinations were calculated as described by  <cit> . as a measure of heat susceptibility, the heat susceptibility index  was defined as the slope of a linear trendline of the loading of an inbred line on pc <dig> versus the three studied heat levels. heat susceptible inbred lines were characterized by a high hsi, where heat tolerant inbreds had a low hsi.

to estimate the genotypic variance σi <dig> and the residual error variance σe <dig> of the experiment, a further analysis was conducted using model  with the genotype effect ii as random. for each trait, the repeatability h <dig> of the results at the three heat levels was calculated using the formula   h2=σi2σi2+σe2n. 

to check the significance of the effects of the inbred lines, heat levels and the interaction of inbreds and heat levels, a combined model across all heat levels   yijk=μ+ii+hj+ij+rjk+eijk 

was fitted, where yijk was the observed value for the ith inbred in the kth replication in the jth heat level, hj was the effect of the jth heat level, ij the effect of the interaction between the ith inbred line and the jth heat level, rjk the effect of replication k nested in heat level j, and eijk the residual error. the heat level, inbred line and the interaction effect were set as fixed effects, whereas the replication effect was set as random. all mixed model analyses were performed using the software asreml  <cit> .

transcriptome sequencing
sample preparation and rna sequencing
at the end of the previously described growing period, leaf samples of the inbred lines were collected at the three heat levels with n= <dig> replications at each of the three heat levels. a sample of about  <dig>  cm <dig> was cut from the centre of the latest fully developed leaf of each plant, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°c. the leaf tissue of five replications was pooled to a total of two replications for each genotype - heat level combination to reduce biological variation for the following rna sequencing. this resulted in a total of  <dig> samples . total rna was isolated using the rneasy plant kit . rna quantity was assessed and quality control was performed using a qubit fluorometer  and the  <dig> bioanalyzer . dna was removed using the turbo dna free kit  and the solution was purified using the rneasy Ⓡ minelute Ⓡ cleanup spin columns . rrna was depleted prior to sequencing using the ribominus™plant kit . library preparation and rna sequencing were performed at the max planck genome centre cologne using an illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing machine . the  <dig> samples were combined to eight 100-bp single-end illumina sequencing libraries with each six  individually barcoded samples. each library was sequenced on one lane of the sequencing machine.

data analysis
outcoming single-end sequence reads were cleaned for reads containing primer or adaptor sequences. sequencing reads with more than 30% of bases with a phred quality score of ≤ <dig> were excluded from the following analyses . high quality reads were aligned to the b <dig> reference sequence  using tophat . we used the r package easyrnaseq  to filter the aligned reads for protein-coding genes located on the nuclear chromosomes and counted transcript reads per gene model in the  <dig> samples. as there is no purpose in analysing genes, which are not expressed at a reasonable level in none of the inbred line - heat level combinations, we excluded poorly expressed genes which did not show at least two counts per million reads in at least two samples . the biological coefficient of variation  was calculated according to  <cit>  from the square root of the common dispersion using the r package edger . the easyrnaseq table of counts was subject to a pc analysis to assess transcriptomic variation in the  <dig> samples and identify clustering of inbred lines, heat levels, and heterotic pools using the r package deseq .

to identify first, genes involved in heat response and second, heat tolerance related genes, we selected three sets of candidate genes.  genes with differential regulation upon increasing heat stress, where the eight inbred lines were considered as replications of one average genotype. these genes are designated in the following as overall heat responsive genes.  genes with differential expression in every single inbred line, where the individual inbreds were considered and the number of overlapping differentially expressed genes between the inbreds was assessed. these genes are designated in the following as common heat responsive genes.  genes, where differential regulation upon increasing heat stress was a function of the phenotypically assessed heat tolerance of each inbred line. these genes are designated in the following as heat tolerance genes.

for establishing the set of overall heat responsive genes, expression of each gene across all inbred lines at a heat level was explained by the metric value of the respective heat level using the linear regression model in edger:   yijk=μ+xjβ+eijk, 

where yijk was the expression of the respective gene of inbred i at heat level j in replication k. μ was the y-intercept and β the slope of the linear regression respectively. xj defined the jth heat level, where the heat levels 25°c and 38°c were assigned the metric values  <dig> and  <dig>  correspondingly the 32°c heat level was assigned x=7/ <dig>  eijk was the residual error term. β was estimated to obtain the expression change across all inbred - replication combinations across the three heat levels. the data samples were normalized with edger’s internal normalization procedure for library size and dispersions between biological replications were calculated genewisely.

in this study, genes with a false discovery rate   <cit>  of < <dig>  and |log2|> <dig> were considered as significantly differently expressed genes. mapman  was used to classify the overall heat responsive genes by biological function and to graphically illustrate them in a custom created overview of involved molecular processes . for the same set of genes, information on genome position and gene description  was accessed via the r package biomart . gene ontology  terms were assigned to each of the overall heat responsive genes and a go term enrichment analysis was carried out  <cit>  using the zea mays ssp maize genome locus reference . to determine significantly enriched go terms between the heat responsive genes within the rna-seq approach and the reference a hypergeometric test with fdr < <dig>  was applied for the upregulated and downregulated genes, separately.

in a next step, we identified heat responsive genes for each inbred line by using the model:   yijk=μ+xjγi+eijk, 

to calculated the expression change of each gene for one inbred line. in this model, γi represented the slope of the linear regression, and thus the expression change, for each inbred line i. genes with an fdr < <dig>  and |log2|> <dig> were considered as significantly differently expressed genes for each inbred line. the overlapping differentially expressed genes among all inbred lines was examined to define the set of common heat responsive genes.

the set of heat tolerance genes was established applying the following linear model,   γi=μ+hiδ+ei, 

where γi was the expression change for the ith inbred, estimated with model  and hi the hsi of the ith inbred. δ was the slope of the linear regression for the respective gene across all inbreds which represented the magnitude of differential regulation between heat tolerant and heat susceptible inbred lines. the heat tolerance genes showed a significant  association between γi and the hsi and a slope of |δ|> <dig> across inbred lines. the heat tolerance genes were included in a heatmap with log <dig> fold change  of each inbred line over heat levels  <dig>  7/ <dig> and  <dig>  i.e. 25°c, 32°c and 38°c, where genes were clustered by their differential reaction across the inbreds lines. information on biological processes of the heat tolerance genes was obtained using the r package biomart with dataset zmays_eg_gene and from maizegdb .

to validate rna sequencing results, quantitative real-time pcr  was conducted using dynamo sybr green 2-step qrt-pcr kit . primers were developed using primer3web interface  for  <dig> genes, randomly selected from the total set of detected genes, excluding poorly expressed genes, and for actin <dig>  as a reference gene. rna extraction and dnase treatment were carried out as described previously and the rna of ten replications was pooled. a total of  <dig> rna samples  each with  <dig>  μg was reversely transcribed using superscript™first-strand synthesis system for rt-pcr . the pcr protocol was replicated three times as follows: initially 96°c for  <dig> minutes was followed by  <dig> cycles of each 96°c for  <dig> seconds, 55°c for  <dig> seconds and 72°c for  <dig> seconds. the last step at 72°c lasted  <dig> minutes. to determine the correlation of sequencing and qrt-pcr, the relative log <dig> fold expression changes for the mentioned  <dig> genes to actin <dig> was calculated for the data obtained by sequencing and by qrt-pcr for each inbred line - heat level combination according to  <cit> .

RESULTS
repeatabilities of the assessed traits at each of the three studied heat levels were high with values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . all measured traits were monotonic increasing or decreasing with increasing heat level, except the leaf elongation rate, which showed a maximum at 32°c. effects of inbred lines and heat levels as well as the interaction between both were significant  for all studied traits. the first two pcs of the pc analysis of the phenotypic data  explained  <dig> and 12% of the total variance of the inbred line-by-heat level means . pc <dig> correlated significantly  with all measured traits with |r| between  <dig>  and  <dig> . we observed a clustering of the samples with respect to the heat levels, whereas no clustering of inbred lines or heterotic pools was observed. the hsi ranked the inbred lines in the order from tolerant to susceptible: s <dig>  s <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  s <dig> and p <dig> . dent inbreds were the two most heat tolerant and the two most heat susceptible genotypes.figure  <dig>

gene description


by explaining the gene expression change of each inbred line by its phenotypic hsi, we identified  <dig> heat tolerance genes . these heat tolerance genes were divided into two major clusters of genes by their expression in heat susceptible inbreds . the first class included  <dig> genes with strong upregulation of gene expression with increasing heat levels in heat susceptible inbreds compared to heat tolerant inbreds, whereas the second class of  <dig> genes showed the contrary regulation pattern. seven of the heat tolerance genes were also overall heat responsive genes. the heat tolerance genes were of a variety of biological functions. amongst others, we found that the heat tolerance genes have a predicted biological function of protein folding and biosynthesis, cell wall modification, and calcium signalling.figure  <dig>

discussion
phenotypic variation for heat tolerance of european flint and dent maize inbred lines
we observed a high repeatability for all evaluated phenotypic traits at the three examined heat levels . this was in accordance with results of  <cit> , who detected similar levels of repeatability for the traits leaf greenness and plant dry weight under optimal  and chilling conditions  in a set of flint and dent inbred lines in growth chamber experiments. the true trait means for the genotypes at the studied heat levels could, thus, be estimated reliably in our study and therewith are a good basis for the following genome-wide expression profiling experiment.

the low and strong reduction of mean dry weight at  <dig> and 38°c, respectively, compared to 25°c, indicates that we were successful in setting the appropriate temperatures of the medium and the strong heat level. the trait means across inbred lines for leaf greenness and dry weight per plant showed different alteration with increasing heat levels, depending on the severity of heat stress. compared to 25°c, at the medium heat level , the mean leaf greenness across all inbreds was reduced notably, where the mean dry weight was only slightly decreased. at the high heat level  in turn, leaf greenness did not show further notable decrease in comparison with 32°c, where dry weight was decreased substantially . chlorophyll content, which is correlated with leaf greenness  <cit> , was reduced in wheat at high temperature  compared to control temperature  in a study of  <cit> . generally, growth reduction in plants upon high temperature stress may be due to reduced photosynthesis, which is associated with leaf greenness, caused by an injury of the photosynthetic system  <cit> . fokar  <dig>   <cit>  found a negative  association between chlorophyll retention and grain filling, as a measure for plant performance, and stated that grain filling could even be promoted by fast leaf senescence i.e. leaf greenness reduction, as metabolites might be transported from senescent tissue to the grain. this effect could be similar in our study, where at 32°c, where leaf greenness was highly reduced, metabolites could sustain plant growth and development. another effect sustaining plant growth is the increased development speed at increased heat level, which was observed from the increased number of leaves per plant at heat stress. the increased growth rate at 32°c compared to the lower as well as higher temperature regime was probably due to this increased speed of development at increased temperature, where plants were still not greatly damaged by heat stress.

to obtain a description of total plant performance across the three examined heat levels, we performed a pc analysis integrating all observed traits, i.e. leaf growth rate, shoot dry weight, plant height, the number of leaves, leaf temperature, and leaf greenness. pc <dig> explained with 78% a high proportion of the total variance and was correlated significantly  with each observed trait . therewith, in our study, pc <dig> was sufficient as a unique integrative trait to explain plant performance. in order to quantify heat tolerance in maize seedlings, several morphological and physiological traits were studied by  <cit> . in this paper, the shoot fresh and dry mass, shoot length, leaf area, growth rate, increase in leaf area, and the assimilation rate were used as single traits to quantify the reaction of maize seedlings upon strong heat stress . our integrative plant performance trait, i.e. pc <dig>  has the advantage that it represents each of the observed traits and gives a broad picture of plant performance under stress conditions with one single value for each genotype - heat level combination.

to quantify heat tolerance on a multi-trait level, the hsi was calculated as the slope of a linear regression of pc <dig> over the three examined heat levels. we observed a strong difference in heat tolerance between the eight inbred lines with hsi ranging from  <dig>  up to  <dig>  . two of the inbred lines  showed a high hsi  and were therewith considered as heat susceptible. in contrast, the other six inbreds showed lower hsis and were therewith considered as more heat tolerant than the before mentioned two inbreds. this finding was associated with a significant  inbred line - heat level interaction, which was observed for all examined traits. we have, thus, a very divers set of inbreds, which indicates that our study is appropriate to investigate heat response and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of heat tolerance in diverse genetic backgrounds.

despite observing diverse heat tolerance reactions for the eight examined inbreds, we found that neither flint nor dent inbreds showed systematically higher or lower heat tolerance . the same trend was observed for the adaptation to low temperatures, where  <cit>  showed that both european flints and european dents showed chilling tolerance. besides this finding, we observed that dent inbreds were the most heat tolerant and the most heat susceptible inbreds, suggesting that the dent pool shows more variability in terms of tolerance to high temperature during seedling stage.

transcriptomic variation
the validation of the transcriptome sequencing results by qrt-pcr resulted in an r of  <dig>  , and therewith were in the order of magnitude of results of another rnaseq study in maize  <cit> . this finding indicated that our rna sequencing results were reliable.

we observed in our study that the biological coefficient of variation  of the transcriptomic data across all observed genes and inbred - heat level combinations was  <dig>  and was therewith in the range of previously reported values  <cit> .

the number of read counts per sample in our study was between  <dig> and  <dig> million . the mean library size was in accordance with results of  <cit> , who observed a median library size of  <dig>  million reads. in the current study, we observed a remarkable variation of library size between the three examined heat levels. tarazona  <dig>   <cit>  advised a balanced sequencing depth between conditions for differential expression analyses to support accurate statistical analyses. as the number of read counts was at the minimum  <dig> million for one sample in our study, however, we do not expect an impact on the power to detect differentially expressed genes.table  <dig>

the genes, for which the detected transcript reads accounted, showed a strong expression variation between inbred lines . consistent with the pca of the phenotypic data , we observed a clustering of the heat levels in the pca of the transcriptomic data. furthermore, we observed a clustering of the inbreds with respect to transcriptomic variation according to their heterotic pool assignment, which was not observed for the phenotypic data. this finding was in good agreement to the findings of clustering of heterotic groups with respect to genotypic variation in previous studies  <cit> . the differentiation we observed based on the genome-wide expression data between the flint and dent pool was stronger than the differentiation between heat tolerant and heat susceptible inbreds. this finding can be explained by the separate breeding history of flints and dents, based on their introduction into europe from the americas  <cit>  and the pools show, thus, strong genetic and transcriptomic differences.

approaches to identify heat responsive genes
in this study, two different approaches for identifying heat responsive genes were applied in order to cover the different aspects. firstly, we identified overall heat responsive genes as genes with differential regulation upon increasing heat levels, where the eight inbreds were considered as replications of one average genotype. the set of overall heat responsive genes can help to understand molecular defence mechanisms against heat stress of maize. this set represents genes showing the general response of temperate maize to heat stress and may not be essential for each inbred lines’ heat response, but include all strategies to cope with heat stress used by the studied maize inbreds. in our study a broad set of maize inbreds were studied, whereas in previous papers mostly two contrasting genotypes were included to study the transcriptomic response upon abiotic stress. therefore we expect that based on our results generally applicable statements on transcriptomic heat response of european flint and dent inbreds are possible.

in addition to the overall heat responsive genes, we identified the common heat responsive genes by overlapping the heat responsive genes of each inbred line. these genes account for heat responsive mechanisms shared by all inbred lines. the common heat responsive genes represent a small set of genes, which are, as they are differentially expressed in each inbred line likewise, absolutely necessary, i.e. indispensable key genes for the heat response as discussed for drought stress in maize by  <cit> .

molecular response of temperate maize upon increasing heat levels
in the set of  <dig> overall heat responsive genes, three go terms, associated with the response to external stress , were enriched . this suggests a strong connection of the response to heat stress with other types of external stress response.

furthermore, we observed an upregulation upon increasing heat levels of seven calcium-dependent signalling genes . as membrane fluidity is increased with increasing temperature, this results in an increased calcium-ion influx in the cells  <cit> , serving as messenger for stress signalling  <cit> . our results are in accordance with the previously reported finding that calcium-dependent signalling genes play essential roles in plant response to abiotic stress  <cit> .

stress signalling pathways, e.g. calcium signalling, in turn, trigger the regulation of transcriptional factors  <cit> . transcription regulation genes were the most prominent group of heat responsive genes in our study with  <dig> upregulated genes. they have the potential to activate further stress responsive mechanisms to re-establish cell homeostasis, to protect, as well as repair proteins and membranes  <cit> .

coping with the damages produced by oxidative stress is viable for plant survival at heat stress. the binding of tetrapyrrole, which was found to be associated with oxidative stress and cell death in plants  <cit> , is associated with three go terms , enriched in the heat responsive gene set . we observed, further, an upregulation of six antioxidant genes  and six cytochrome p <dig> related genes in the set of overall heat responsive genes . these genes are known to be involved in the antioxidant defence of plants  <cit>  and act in the detoxification of damages due to oxidative stress  <cit> .

further we found an increased expression of  <dig> heat responsive genes associated with the lipid metabolism. plants try to change membrane composition as an adaptive mechanism to heat stress  <cit> . the identified lipid metabolism genes could be involved in phospholipid changes of the membrane composition to protect and recover damaged cell membranes. however this requires further research.

we observed that with  <dig> a high number of the  <dig> overall heat responsive genes were involved in the protein metabolism. furthermore, we identified  <dig> heat shock genes, which act as chaperones and are involved in protein-folding  <cit> . this finding was supported by  <dig> go terms associated with protein folding  and amino acid metabolism , which were enriched in the upregulated heat responsive genes . this illustrates that protection of proteins against oxidative stress is another key component of the response to heat stress in maize.

several go terms were enriched in the upregulated heat responsive genes , which are associated with carbohydrate metabolism  and could play a role in a modification of starch synthesis at heat stress.

the set of overall heat responsive genes illustrates that heat stress response in temperate maize involves a multitude of biological processes . the enrichment of go terms in the heat responsive genes , which revealed the involvement of numerous biological functions and molecular processes in the heat response was in agreement with this statement.

the overlap of the heat responsive genes of each inbred between inbred lines, designated as the common heat responsive genes , was very small, representing 1% total of genes detected as heat responsive in one of the eight inbreds. our finding indicated that individual inbred lines developed different genetic mechanisms in response to environmental stress, which overlap only to a small degree between genotypes. therefore it is advisable to include a variety of genotypes with different genetic backgrounds and origin in abiotic stress expression studies in order to combine different genetic strategies to cope with heat stress.

identification of heat tolerance genes
we used a new approach to identify heat tolerance genes, which is characterized by the inclusion of phenotypic and environmental variation in the statistical analysis. the traditional approach to select stress tolerance candidate genes is to compare two groups of genotypes with contrasting stress tolerance, as outlined in several studies, discussed previously in this paper in the context of heat response. the inclusion of a diverse set of inbred lines with high variation for heat tolerance in our study, has the advantages of, first, considering the continuous distribution of the values of quantitative traits, and second, considering phenotypically intermediate genotypes without focussing only on the extremes.

further, we included a linear regression model across three heat levels to identify differentially expressed genes over a temperature gradient, which is rarely used in other abiotic stress tolerance studies.  <cit>  considered three levels of stress intensity , but compared gene expression of pairs of stress levels instead of evaluating linear dependency of gene expression across stress conditions. this results in an increased number of statistical tests. our approach consisted in one statistical test, including all stress levels, which leads to a reduction of the multiple-test problem. furthermore, our approach has the advantage of considering the effect of a linear increase in temperature more independently of the actual studied heat levels. we could, thus, identify heat tolerance candidate genes for a stress intensity range between the examined heat levels in our study, i.e. from 25°c to 38°c. these two particularities can be reasons that none of the heat tolerance genes, identified in our study, was previously described in literature to be involved in heat tolerance in maize.

in this study, the p-value, which states the significance of the linear dependency between the expression change for each inbred line and the hsi of the respective inbred, was not adjusted for multiple testing to not lower even more the low power to detect heat tolerance genes. this low power comes from the consideration of phenotypic variation for heat tolerance in the gene identification method, which is comparable with an association mapping approach. in typical association mapping studies in maize, the number of genotypes in a population ranges between around  <dig> and  <dig> individuals  <cit> . we conclude that, in a study to identify candidate genes using transcriptome profiling, which includes phenotypic variation, it is indispensable to use a higher number of genotypes, comparable to those of association mapping studies. nevertheless, for reasons of completeness, we discuss the identified heat tolerance genes.

the heat tolerance genes identified in this study were upregulated in most of the inbred lines and there was rarely downregulation in one of the inbreds . this indicated that genes which are differentially regulated between inbred lines based on phenotypic heat tolerance are typically genes, which are generally upregulated with increasing heat levels. genes, which are downregulated with increasing heat levels are typically not differentially regulated between inbred lines. this may be partly explained due to the finding that, in general, more genes are upregulated than downregulated at heat stress, as it comes obvious from the set of overall heat responsive genes . nevertheless, there must be a further, still elusive, physiological or statistical explanation for the almost absence of downregulated genes in the set of heat tolerance genes.

for  <dig> of the total of  <dig> heat tolerance genes, earlier studies indicated a mechanistic involvement in different abiotic stress responses including salt, heat and oxidative stress. this finding could be explained by interconnection between the molecular responses to different kinds of abiotic stresses, which similarly produce osmotic and oxidative stress on the cellular level  <cit> .

to further validate, if the identified  <dig> heat tolerance genes explain phenotypic variation for heat tolerance, further studies have to be performed e.g. with segregating populations derived from crosses of heat tolerant and heat susceptible inbred lines presented in this study. in such experiments with a similar experimental design as the present study, the expression change with increasing heat levels of the  <dig> heat tolerance candidate genes could be detected using rna sequencing or qrt-pcr and correlated with the phenotypic heat tolerance of each genotype from the segregating populations. another validation approach could be to overexpress or inhibited the expression of the heat tolerance candidate genes in selected inbred lines. comparing the phenotypic heat tolerance of the modified genotype with non-transformed genotypes can evidence a possible heat tolerance function of the respective gene. in a subsequent experiment, thus transformed genotypes and previously mentioned segregating populations could be tested at heat stress conditions in field experiments to examine if the selected candidate genes have a heat tolerance function in a natural environment as well as in the adult stage. validated genes could then be used in a molecular breeding approach, in order to obtain heat tolerant varieties.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we found a high variation for heat tolerance during seedling stage in a set of european maize inbred lines, which is not dependent on heterotic pools, but comes with different molecular strategies of single inbred lines to cope with increasing heat levels. we could, further, support and expand knowledge of the heat response pathways in maize and plants in general . finally, we identified  <dig> heat tolerance candidate genes , whose molecular function for heat tolerance and adaptation is unknown and should be clarified using functional studies. we suggest further the performance of transcriptome profiling experiments with populations of inbred genotypes derived from biparental crosses in order to improve the power to detect significance of detected heat tolerance genes.
