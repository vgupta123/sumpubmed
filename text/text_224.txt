BACKGROUND
the testis determining gene sry on the mammalian y-chromosome triggers the testis development pathway in placental mammals  <cit> . it encodes a protein that is composed of a highly conserved three helix hmg domain with additional hinge and bridge domains. variations are found in the n- and c-terminal domains among species. in most mammals, sry is found as a single locus; however, rodent species  <cit> , have been reported to show copy number variation . cnv of sry has been detected in humans exposed to radiation or those with sex chromosome related anomalies  <cit> . in rattus norvegicus, multiple loci of sry are expressed and code for proteins with altered amino acid sequences  <cit> . these loci have been suggested to function in the development of increased blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat  compared to the normotensive wistar kyoto   <cit> . one locus, sry <dig>  has been detected in shr but not in wky, and codes for a protein that has amino acid differences altering promoter regulation of renin-angiotensin system genes  <cit> . the entire rat y-chromosome for rattus norvegicus has yet to be assembled, thus limiting full understanding of gene duplication and divergence of sry copies. using newly deposited bac clone sequences from the shr rat strain , we have localized the sry copies relative to each other, identifying several new sry loci. the multiple copies of sry code for proteins with amino acid variations resulting in functional changes to promoter activity and nuclear localization.

RESULTS
identification of sry copies in the rattus norvegicus shr strain
several bac sequences for the shr/akr y chromosome have been deposited in genbank. we have combined our past analyses of sry in this strain with these new sequences, to identify contigs that include various sry loci . the current number of identified sry loci in rattus norvegicus is eleven. the novel eleventh locus we have designated as nonhmg sry due to a frame shift mutation yielding a protein with an incomplete hmg box.
sry 
region of the shr y-chromosome

sry
the assembly of the sry region has resulted in two aligned contigs of 432 kb and 377 kb, respectively. using these contigs, the location and identity of multiple sry loci were mapped . the first contig  contains sry <dig>  nonhmg sry and sry4a while the second  contains sry <dig>  sry3c, sry3b, sry3bii, sry <dig>  and sry3a. in addition to the sry loci found in these two contigs, two additional previously identified sry loci  did not map to either contig. repeatmasker identified a high level of line l <dig> elements in both contig  <dig>  and contig  <dig>  relative to dna sequence flanking the single copy of human sry  or mouse sry  . alignment of sequences for the multiple rat sry loci reveals regions conserved among the various copies . many of the sites where homology is lost are flanked by line l <dig> elements . phylogenetic analysis using the sequence conserved in sry copies in these contigs shows clustering of the sry <dig> loci  and a separate clustering of sry <dig> and sry4a .

newly identified sry copies in other rattus norvegicus strains
four novel sry sequences  were identified in the shr/akr in this paper. of these, the nonhmg sry sequence was confirmed from genomic dna, with 100% sequence homology in shr/akr , wky/akr , and sd/hsd  strains. sry <dig>  sry4a and sry3bii were confirmed in both shr/akr and wky/akr strains using pcr reactions and selective restriction digests designed to differentiate loci based on pcr products .

identification of other loci in the sry region of the shr y-chromosome
the zinc finger on the y  locus is found between sry <dig> and the nonhmg sry. this locus is found on many other mammalian y-chromosomes near sry. in addition to zfy, we have identified a possible med <dig> locus between sry <dig> and the nonhmg sry. normally med <dig> is found on the mammalian x-chromosome, where it contains  <dig> exons separated by large introns. the form identified on the y-chromosome of shr is spliced, containing  <dig> of the normal  <dig> exons of the long form med <dig> of the x-chromosome . located 1kb from the med14y sequence  is an ltr/ervk element . the presence of both an ltr element and spliced exons suggests that this copy has been retrotransposed onto the y-chromosome. the protein coded by med14y would be highly homologous to the x-chromosome med <dig>  if it could be transcribed and translated. in addition to med14y, we have identified a ccdc110-like locus  and a hmgb1-like locus .

sry protein sequence comparison
translating each of the sry loci into protein sequences  allows for comparison of amino acid variations. the eleven sry loci can be translated into nine  different protein sequences. several sry loci encode the same protein sequence; therefore, we created a new naming system for the sry proteins using greek letters to help to differentiate protein naming from the sry loci naming. the sry3/sry3c  and sry3b/sry3bii  loci translate to the same protein sequences . sequence alignments of all sry proteins reveal variation at amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and in the q-repeat length of the c-terminus. the nonhmg sry codes for a highly divergent sequence containing the first helix and nuclear localization site of normal sry , but due to a frame shift mutation the sequence diverges after this region. this protein sequence following the frame shift mutation contains a high level of lys and gln amino acids , indicating a high potential for interactions with other proteins.

using the dna sequence, starting at the atg start codon and extending through the stop codon of each sry copy, phylogenetic analysis was performed comparing rat sry copies to muennink’s spiny rat  copies, msry, and hsry . all the proteins coded by the sry <dig> loci  cluster together , as do those from sry <dig> and sry4a , similar to the analysis done using the maximally conserved sequences . the phylogenetic analysis suggests the possibility that a sry locus, present before the sry <dig> split from sry <dig>  sry <dig> and sry4a, may have been the original locus in rodents prior to copy number increase. inspection of individual amino acids found in the rat sry copies when compared to human and mouse protein sequences supports this claim . as expected, the nonhmg sry sequence is highly divergent from all other sry, a likely result of drift following the frame shift mutation.

sry protein functional variations
to analyze functional variation of amino acid differences in the multiple sry proteins, this study used both modeling and site directed mutagenesis. three amino acid sites differ in the hmg box  and an additional amino acid site in the highly conserved hinge domain . amino acids  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> additionally fall into nuclear localization signal sites  <cit> . using a modeled structure of the protein coded by the sry <dig> locus  interacting with dna , it can be seen that substitutions in amino acids  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  may have a slight propensity to alter dna binding stability  and energy .

sryα binds to dna elements that are known to be bound by hsry in a sequence specific manner . use of a control ebna dna  is shifted by ebna protein extract , with the shift outcompeted with unlabeled dna . adding sryα lysate to this ebna dna does not shift the band , confirming specificity of dna sequence for binding. taking a sry dna binding element and adding the ebna protein did not result in a shift  while addition of sryα lysate did . the sryα binding is competed off with unlabeled sry dna . the shifting of the dna was concentration dependent on sryα lysate . this confirms for the first time that sry protein from rattus norvegicus can bind to similar dna sequences as human and mouse.

sryα and sryγ primarily localize to the nucleus of the cell, while sryβ is also found in the cytoplasm . mutating amino acid  <dig> in sryα from an arg to a his  resulted in more sry localization in the cytoplasm, while mutating amino acid  <dig> in sryβ from his to arg  abolished the cytoplasmic localization. this confirms that changes to amino acid  <dig> can alter cellular localization, while changes at amino acid  <dig> and  <dig> likely have minimal change to cellular localization .

the presence of thr at amino acid  <dig> defines the sry <dig> subgroup . sry in all other mammalian species , every member of the sox subfamily to which sry belongs, and rat sryα/β/η/θ proteins all contain a pro at amino acid  <dig>  comparing sryα to sryγ, only two amino acids vary . the sry <dig> promoter is differentially repressed by sryα and sryγ compared to the control or each other . when amino acid  <dig> is mutated in sryα from a pro to a thr, this decreases the sry <dig> promoter regulation, yielding less repression relative to sryα . changing amino acid  <dig> in sryγ from a thr to a pro increased sry <dig> promoter repression relative to sryγ . changing amino acid  <dig> from his to gln in sryα had no effect on the promoter regulation . in contrast, when amino acid  <dig> of sryγ was changed from gln to his, promoter repression was decreased relative to sryγ .

comparing the proteins from the sry4/4a loci  with those of the previously identified sry proteins, amino acids  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are conserved with sry γ-ζ , while amino acid  <dig> is shared with sryα, sryβ and all other known mammalian sry proteins . two unique amino acid variations from the rest of the rat sry proteins are found in the bridge domain of sryη/θ. mutations of sryα at amino acid  <dig>  showed a trend towards decreased repression of the sry <dig> promoter relative to sryα . a double mutant  at amino acid  <dig> and also  <dig>  showed regulation similar to the single mutant construct . sryα p83s caused a significant loss of regulation on the sry <dig> promoter construct; however, this variant is not found by itself in any of the rat sry copies.

sry proteins with different lengths of the q-rich c-terminal region  activate the ar <dig> promoter construct at various levels compared to the control . sryβ has a deletion of  <dig> amino acids when compared to sryα and sryγ . removing these  <dig> amino acids from sryα, creating a construct known as sryα, decreased promoter activity compared to the wild type sryα  yielding similar values as sryβ. completely removing the  <dig> amino acids of the q-rich region of sryα, known as sryα, resulted in minimal regulation of the promoter as did a construct containing only the hmg box of sryα . sryβ with the  <dig> q amino acids of sryα or sryγ added, known as sryβ , increased promoter activity compared to sryβ, yielding a value similar to sryα and sryγ . the complete removal of the q-rich region of sryβ, sryβ , caused a complete loss of promoter regulation. similar results to mutations of sryα  were seen when the deletions were made to sryγ . modeling the q-rich region and the remaining c-terminal end of rat sry  shows the locations of variations outside of the hmg box mapped onto the structure of sryα interacting with dna .

discussion
multiple sry loci in rattus norvegicus are known to be expressed  <cit> . sequencing of the shr/akr rat y chromosome is under progress by the y chromosome project . identifying and labeling all the sry loci and functional variations are of importance for both annotating y-chromosome sequence data and for understanding how each of these sry loci functions. the shr/akr strain has been shown to have loci on the y-chromosome that are associated with blood pressure increases  <cit>  and other sympathetic nervous system phenotypes reviewed in  <cit> . animals with the y-chromosome of shr and wky autosomes have higher blood pressure than wky males  <cit> . studies have revealed the inability to amplify the sry <dig> locus, present in shr, from wky genomic dna, suggesting a potential increase in cnv of shr over wky  <cit> . delivery of the coding sequence of either sry <dig> <cit>  or sry <dig> <cit>  but not sry <dig> <cit>  into the kidney of normotensive wky rats induces a blood pressure increase through the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system. with sry <dig> present in shr but not detected in wky  <cit> , this additional copy of an sry gene  may be largely responsible for the blood pressure elevation seen in y-chromosome crosses of the consomic strains  <cit> . y-chromosome sequence analysis has revealed at least eleven sry loci on the y-chromosome of rattus norvegicus shr/akr that code for nine different proteins. it is possible that additional loci exist and have yet to be sequenced; sequencing of the shr/akr y-chromosome is still underway. we do not know which sry locus codes for testis determination in rattus norvegicus or if multiple loci contribute to this function. it may be possible that any of the ten sry loci  could determine sex if expressed with proper developmental timing. four new loci were detected in this current study. these were previously unidentified due to an insertion of dna after the 3’ untranslated region in these newly identified loci, preventing pcr amplification with the primer sets previously used. new primer sets and restriction digests allowed us to identify these new loci in both shr and wky rats.

compiled contigs for the y-chromosome region containing the sry loci in rattus norvegicus allow for identification of possible mechanisms of gene duplications. of the four loci identified in our contigs that are not sry , several are flanked by repetitive elements that may have contributed to locus positioning on the y-chromosome. an ltr/ervk element was identified 5’ of the start codon of the med14y. this med14y is highly homologous to the x-chromosome med <dig>  however it is missing the normal introns, suggesting retrotransposition of a mature mrna onto the y-chromosome of rat. an ltr element has also been identified 3’ of the zfy and 5’ of the ccdc <dig> loci. currently we do not know the function or conservation  of these loci on the y-chromosome in other rat species. future work will be required to determine the dynamic gene evolution occurring in rat y-chromosome evolution.

the largest conserved fragment of dna sequence within the contigs is between sry <dig> and sry4a, with a large region of 3’ conservation . analysis of the conservation revealed a line l <dig> element  conserved at the point where homology is lost; this line l <dig> appears to have the proper sequences to code for proteins of both orfs required for line l <dig> transposition. flanking several other loci  are insertions of line l <dig> elements relative to the other loci, suggesting more recent line l <dig> insertions after copy number increased. sox genes have been shown to regulate the promoters of line-l <dig> elements  <cit>  suggesting a potential interplay between sry and line-l <dig>  these elements, as well as sequence variations, may alter the expression of the various loci, as has already been shown  <cit> . the sry <dig> gene is preferentially expressed in adult adrenal glands relative to testis, while the combination of sry <dig>  sry <dig> and sry3c is expressed at a higher level in the testis relative to adrenal. the sry3c locus shares a high level of conservation with the 3’ end of sry <dig> and a lower level with sry <dig>  these observations suggest that sry3c may have resulted from the original duplication event and then further duplicated and differentiated to give the remaining sry <dig> subgroup members. identifying the mechanism of duplication and order of events is complicated by a continual change to all loci after the duplication events occurred. this may be simplified by understanding the organization of the y-chromosome and sry sequences in other rattus norvegicus strains and other rodent species. for example, our initial sequence analysis comparing the rattus norvegicus and tokudaia muenninki sry copies did not reveal any connections between the duplicated copies at either the dna or amino acid level, indicating that sry duplication has occurred more than once. understanding the duplication events in the rat may help to explain duplications of sry seen in humans exposed to radiation or with turner syndrome  <cit> .

amino acid differences among the proteins coded by the multiple sry loci result in functional variation. from the eleven loci, we predict nine protein sequences . sryβ has several amino acid variations in nuclear localization sites  and also the c-terminal end . sry protein localizes to the nucleus using two different localization signals   <cit> . the first nls is found as a bipartite signal known to interact with calmodulin  <cit> . amino acid  <dig> falls into the nls in the first of the bipartite sequences and amino acid  <dig> in the second. mutations of amino acid  <dig> in sryα decreased nuclear localization, and models for the interaction between sry and calmodulin suggest a decreased interaction when amino acid  <dig> is a his .

all the sry <dig> loci  contain a threonine at amino acid  <dig>  rather than the normal proline. a proline is found at this amino acid in all human sox genes  and all mammalian sry sequences  <cit> . variation at amino acid  <dig> in hsry is associated with sex reversal  <cit> . this suggests a high degree of conservation, likely required for proper dna bend angle, protein recruitment, and gene regulation  <cit> . amino acid  <dig> falls in the second nls which is thought to work through importin-β <dig>  <cit> . both sryα and sryγ localize to the nucleus , and changes from a proline to a threonine at amino acid  <dig> do not seem to alter nuclear localization. promoter activity assays show that the proline to threonine change in sryα leads to changes in activity. modeling approaches and proline to threonine mutations also showed altered regulation of renin-angiotensin system promoters  <cit>  in addition to the sry <dig> promoter in this study. mutations on our sryα and sryγ constructs at amino acid  <dig> altered promoter regulation for sryγ only. this suggests that changes to amino acid  <dig> may compensate for the loss of activity seen when also changing amino acid  <dig>  it should be noted as two amino acids vary between these constructs, sryα p76t and sryγ q38h yield the same mutant proteins as do sryα h38q and sryγ t76p. the sry <dig> promoter regulation for these constructs showed no difference when compared to each other, and serve as an internal control to validate that the changes in regulation could only be due to changes at these two amino acids.

sryη and sryθ proteins  show amino acid variation in the bridge domain. the sry <dig> genes have not been cloned and analyzed for expression, so sryα was chosen for mutagenesis. amino acid  <dig>  is conserved among sryη/sryθ and sryα, therefore making sryα a better choice than the sryγ or sryβ protein constructs to use for mutagenesis. analysis of amino acid variations among the multiple loci, suggests that sry <dig> and sry4a are very old loci as they alone  share amino acid  <dig> with mouse . with the variations of sryη and sryθ amino acids falling in the bridge domain, they may alter the interaction with proteins known to interact through the bridge domain of sry, such as the krab containing proteins  <cit> , resulting in altered epigenetic gene silencing of sryη/sryθ regulated genes  <cit> .

the c-terminal end contains the largest area of variation among the sry proteins of rattus norvegicus. there are no known structures for regions outside the hmg box of sry. with the lack of high sequence conservation of the c-terminal end with other species, it is difficult to determine the importance or functionality of this domain. it has been suggested that the c-terminal end can interact with and stabilize dna binding  <cit> ; however, it is also likely that this domain serves to recruit other proteins to the dna. based on the number of charged amino acids on the surface of the c-terminus , which also contains a hydrophobic packed structure , interactions with other proteins  are possible. the stretch of  <dig> amino acids deleted in sryβ alters regulational ability of sry as does the deletion of the entire q-rich c-terminal domain. these results support the importance of this region in rat sry function, even though the region does not share conservation with most other mammalian sry sequences. it is possible that functions of the sry n-terminus in all other mammalian species  <cit>  have been translocated to the c-terminus of rodent sry. since the structure of sry places both the n and c-terminus flanking the hmg box in the same spatial area, one could easily be functionally substituted for the other.

current work is underway to compile and annotate the y-chromosome of the shr/akr strain. in labeling the multiple loci of sry, care needs to be taken in naming as we show in this study and others that there are functional variations in the proteins, with differential expression patterns of each. understanding the mechanisms of the gene duplications seen in this animal model may lend insights into the duplication and transpositions of sry in many human diseases such as sex reversal. ultimately, studies such as this allow us to begin to understand evolution of the lesser studied y-chromosome in an animal model to understand complex diseases such as hypertension, while also addressing the evolution of the y-chromosome in mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
currently we know of eleven sry copies on the rattus norvegicus y-chromosome with additional copies of zfy, med <dig>  ccdc <dig>  and hmgb <dig> in this region. transposable elements seem to play an active role in the duplication and translocation of these genes. the duplication events have led to sry proteins that have amino acid variations that lead to functional alterations in nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. these results show some of the dynamic processes involved in the evolution of the y-chromosome and suggest importance in numerous disease models such as hypertension.
