BACKGROUND
nicotine  is the substance which sustains the addictive use of tobacco, and tobacco results in numerous harmful health effects and continues to be the leading cause of preventable death  <cit> . it has been reported that addicted tobacco users suffer from nc-induced cognitive impairments in some conditions of smoking, as well as modulated moods such as anxiety- and depression-related symptoms  <cit> . cognitive impairments including deficits in working memory, a process for maintaining temporary active information  <cit> , have been regarded as being among the representative symptoms of nc withdrawal observed in nc-dependent human and rodent models  <cit> . furthermore, the direct neurotoxic effects of nc have also been reported depending on the treatment conditions such as dose, period and paradigm, and this neurotoxicity has been suggested to induce memory impairments, particularly at earlier periods in development  <cit> . however, in some clinical and experimental animal studies, cognitive improvements or absence of any effects have been demonstrated  <cit> . negative, positive or no effects of nc have also been reported against the anxiety-related behaviors  <cit> .

working memory impairments have been reported for various stressors such as restraint stress  in both humans and rodent models  <cit> . like certain nc treatments, such stressors also induce and exacerbate the anxiety-like behavioral responses in rodent models  <cit> . furthermore, it has been suggested that brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, for which nc-induced modulations have been demonstrated  <cit> , are concurrently involved in the development of stress-induced working memory impairments and anxiety  <cit> . however, there are only a few studies investigating the characteristic effects of nc as a stressor, particularly those on cognitive function  <cit> .

a considerable number of studies have implicated the relationship between nc and stress. for example, in some rodent models, repeated or acute stress has been shown to aggravate the behavioral and neuronal effects of nc  <cit> . recent human studies have shown some directly-exacerbated mood symptoms induced by stress in smokers  <cit> . however, against the behavioral and neuronal impairments caused by stress, antagonistic effects of subsequently administered nc have been shown in some rodent models  <cit> . with respect to cognitive function, nc has also been reported to block stress-induced impairments in several experimental conditions in rodents  <cit> . nevertheless, the above-mentioned neurotoxic effects of nc which could lead to cognitive dysfunction  <cit>  may be correlated with the possibility that nc and stress augment each other’s unfavorable effects on cognitive function.

in previous studies, a strong involvement of brain cannabinoid  receptors, typically cb type  <dig>  receptors, was reported in the representative emotion-related behaviors  induced by nc  <cit>  and stress  <cit>  in rodents. this is consistent with the prominent behavioral alterations induced by nc in cb <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , and the overlapping distribution of cb <dig> receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  in some brain regions which supports functional interactions between these receptors  <cit> . furthermore, recent reviews suggest that cb <dig> receptors contribute to deficits in memory including working memory by demonstrating that cb <dig> agonists impair memory formation and cb <dig> antagonists reverse these impairments  <cit> . however, there have been a limited number of studies on the direct contribution of brain cb receptors to the memory-related effects of nc  <cit> . the participation of cb <dig> receptors has also been reported in anxiety processes, but the roles of cb <dig> agonist are contradictory in that both anxiolytic-like and anxiogenic-like effects have been induced depending on the treatment conditions  <cit> . against the nc-induced anxiety-related behaviors, inconsistent and contradictory effects of cb <dig> agonists and other cb ligands have also been demonstrated  <cit> .

in the present study, using behavioral tests in mice  test), the working memory- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations caused by nc were assessed and compared with those caused by immobilization stress , a typical stressor. the interactions between the nc- and im-induced behavioral effects were also examined. furthermore, considering the possible involvement of brain cb receptors in these nc- and/or im-induced memory- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations, the effects of selected cb ligands  were evaluated against these behavioral alterations, as described in previous studies  <cit> .

methods
animals
based on previous studies on nc and stressor treatments  <cit> , male icr mice   were housed in a forced-air facility, which was maintained at 23°c and 50% relative humidity, with a  <dig> h/ <dig> h light/dark cycle. the mice were kept separately in single transparent cages measuring  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig> cm, and were allowed water and rodent chow ad libitum. the experiments described in this report were conducted in accordance with the “guidelines for animal experiments” of the institution   <cit> , which are based on the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, and any pain experienced by the mice was minimized. these guidelines were approved by the institutional ethics committee for animal experiments  <cit> . all of the observations and evaluations were performed by a trained observer who was blinded to the treatment conditions and was not informed of the treatment conditions in advance. each experimental group contained  <dig> mice.

drug and stressor treatments
the protocols for the nc and stressor treatments were determined based on preliminary experiments and previous studies  <cit> . with respect to nc, repeated subcutaneous  doses of nc which caused the emotional behaviors  effectively in mice  <cit>  were selected: single s.c. doses of  <dig>  or  <dig>  mg/kg were administered daily for  <dig> days. nc  was supplied in free-base form at 95% purity, and was freshly dissolved in saline to a volume of  <dig> ml/kg immediately before each administration. with respect to the stressor, treatments using im, which have also been demonstrated to cause these emotional behaviors in rodents  <cit> , were used. in the present experiments, repeated im treatments in which the effects were almost equivalent to the peak effects of the nc treatments in preliminary experiments were selected:  <dig> min of im, which was induced by placing the mouse in a narrow space  in a vinyl bag with some breathing holes, was performed once per day for  <dig> days. furthermore, to investigate the interactions between nc and im, the behavioral alterations were examined in the nc plus im group  which received the above s.c. dose of nc  <dig> min before the im treatment once per day for  <dig> days, according to a previous study  <cit> .

the cb ligands am  <dig> -5--1--4-methyl-1h-pyrazole-3-carboxamide) , cp  <dig>  -cis-3--trans-4-cyclohexanol) , and virodhamine -5z,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetraenoate)  were purchased from tocris cookson inc. , and the doses were selected based on previous studies and preliminary experiments  <cit> . for each drug, the data were collected and shown for those intraperitoneal  doses which induced no toxic behavioral alterations by themselves at the prescribed time point:  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  mg/kg for am,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg for cp, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg for vd. the cb ligands were dissolved and diluted using a mixed solution of dimethylsulphoxide  plus distilled water, and were administered in a volume of  <dig> ml/kg,  <dig> min before each nc, im or nc-im treatment, considering the previously examined time course of the effects of cb ligands against the nc- and/or im-induced working memory- and anxiety-related behaviors  <cit> . since vd was provided in an ethanol solution , the ethanol was evaporated immediately before use under nitrogen gas, and the residue was re-suspended in the same mixed dmso/distilled water solution. in the nc- and im-only groups, a mixed vehicle solution of dmso and distilled water at the same ratio as the cb ligand solutions was injected instead of the cb ligands. in the cb ligand-only groups, the same volume of saline vehicle was injected instead of the nc or im treatment. in the control group without any drug or stressor treatment , the mixed vehicle solution of dmso and distilled water was injected instead of the cb ligands, and then the same volume of saline vehicle was injected instead of the nc or im treatment. the drug and stressor treatments and each experimental session were performed between  <dig> and  <dig> h of the light cycle.

y-maze test
based on previous studies  <cit> , alterations in working memory-related behaviors were examined in the y-maze test using a cardboard apparatus that consisted of three enclosed arms  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> cm  which converged on an equilateral triangular center platform . after the number of spontaneous alteration performance , which was defined as the number of successive triplet entry performances into each of the three arms without any repeated entries  <cit> , and the total number of entries into arms were evaluated , the rate of spontaneous alteration performance   was calculated as a parameter for the working memory-related behaviors. the total number of entries into arms was assessed as a parameter representing locomotor activity  <cit> . considering the previous data  <cit> , the evaluations of these parameters were performed at the  <dig> h time point after the last nc, im or nc-im treatment. at the beginning of each experimental session, each mouse was placed in the center platform of the maze, facing all three arms immediately before the session  <cit> .

elevated plus-maze  test
based on previous studies  <cit> , alterations in anxiety-related behaviors were examined in the epm test using a cardboard apparatus that consisted of two opposite open arms  <dig> ×  <dig> cm  and two enclosed arms  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> cm , positioned  <dig> cm from the floor. after the number of entries into open arms, the time spent on open arms , and the total number of entries into arms were evaluated , the percentage of entries into open arms and the percentage of time spent on open arms were calculated as parameters for the anxiety-related behaviors. the total number of entries into arms was assessed as a parameter representing locomotor activity  <cit> . considering the previous data  <cit> , the evaluations of these parameters were performed at the  <dig> h time point after the last nc, im or nc-im treatment. at the beginning of each experimental session, each mouse was placed diagonally in the center platform of the maze, facing both the open and enclosed arms  <cit> .

statistical analysis
the data were subjected to two-way analysis of variance  for both effects of nc and/or im and effects of the cb ligands  <cit> . with respect to the experiments examining the effects of nc and/or im, a  <dig>  ×  <dig>  factorial design was used for the factors nc × im treatment. with respect to the experiments examining the effects of the cb ligands, a  <dig>  ×  <dig>  factorial design was used for the factors nc and/or im treatment × treatment using each cb ligand. for pairwise comparisons, bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed  <cit> . all of the comparisons were performed using a statistical software package . p values less than  <dig>  were considered to be statistically significant.

discussion
nc- and/or im-induced working memory- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations
in the nc group using repeated treatments of  <dig>  mg/kg nc, as well as in the im group, behavioral alterations suggestive of working memory impairments were observed in the y-maze test  . however, in the nc group using repeated treatments of  <dig>  mg/kg nc, in spite of the appearance of anxiety-like behavioral alterations similar to the im group , the absence of overt working memory-related behavioral alterations  was observed in the y-maze test . previous studies have shown that brain serotonergic and cholinergic systems play crucial roles in mediating anxiety-related behavioral responses  <cit> . in addition to these systems, several neuroendocrine responses  have been reported to participate in the control of anxiety-like behaviors  <cit> . similar modifications in these responses were observed between nc and im  <cit> , and may contribute to their anxiogenic-like effects in the present study . on the other hand, the nc-induced impairments in working memory, unlike the im-induced impairments, occurred with a limited range of doses . it has been reported that modifications in working memory  can occur due to even minuscule changes in prefrontal dopamine  levels  <cit> . therefore, the working memory-related behaviors in the nc groups may be correlated with characteristic but subtle alterations in nachr-mediated prefrontal da release, which was controlled by specific nachr subtypes   <cit> . in addition to da release, the release of other neurotransmitters such as glutamate has been implicated in the nc-induced working memory processes  <cit> .

with respect to the interactions between nc and im in the nc-im group, both nc and im enhanced each other’s effects on the working memory- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations in the y-maze and epm tests. although the relationship between stressors such as im and nc remains controversial as mentioned above , synergistic effects like those observed in previous studies  <cit>  were provided by the nc plus im treatment in the present experimental model. an augmented increase in secreted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  hormones and/or immediate early gene expression was demonstrated in those studies  <cit> . furthermore, the involvement of these molecular changes has also been reported for working memory- and anxiety-related behaviors  <cit> . however, further analyses are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these complex interactions between nc and im.

effects of cannabinoid  ligands
consistent with the previous studies described above  <cit> , the nc- and/or im-induced working memory impairment-like behaviors were antagonized by the cb <dig> antagonist am , and the anxiety-like behaviors were antagonized by the cb agonist cp . furthermore, vd, a mixed cb <dig> ligand with partial agonist plus antagonist activities  <cit> , provided recovering effects against the impaired behaviors related to both working memory and anxiety . similarities in some neuronal responses such as prefrontal da responses have been observed in the immunohistochemical studies between the effects of nc, stressors, and cb <dig> agonists  <cit> . these similarities may result in the cb <dig> antagonist-induced recoveries in the working memory-related behavioral alterations. on the other hand, against the nc- and/or im-induced anxiety-related behavioral alterations, only the cb <dig> ligands acting at least partially as agonists exerted any anxiolytic-like effects. although the mechanisms underlying these discrepancies in the effects of cb ligands have not been elucidated, anxiolytic-like effects of cb agonists have been shown under several different conditions  <cit> . furthermore, certain doses of cb <dig> agonists have been reported to be able to activate the neurotransmission systems related to anti-anxiety  at the molecular level  <cit> . therefore, it could be predicted that the antagonistic effects against the anxiety-like behaviors were provided at least indirectly by way of agonistic activity on cb <dig> receptors.

against both working memory- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations, the cb <dig> partial agonist/antagonist vd exerted some recovering effects . these recovering effects were observed equally in the nc, im and nc-im groups. for the behavioral alterations related to working memory impairments, the recovering effects of vd did not exceed those of the cb <dig> antagonist am, which could be predicted considering the partial cb <dig> agonistic effects of vd. on the other hand, for the behavioral alterations related to anxiety, the recovering effects of vd exceeded those of the cb agonist cp. these results could not be predicted considering the above-mentioned anxiolytic-like effects of the cb <dig> agonists without any antagonistic effects. however, contrary to the present results, there are experimental data showing anxiogenic-like or anti-anxiolytic effects provided by high doses of cb agonists including cp  <cit> . the involvement of an abnormal release of anxiety-related neurotransmitters has been reported for those effects  <cit> . unlike cp, vd possesses cb <dig> antagonistic potential for counteracting anti-anxiolytic effects as an agonist , and thus may function as an effective anxiolytic-like ligand. furthermore, recent studies suggest the possibility that cb <dig> receptors, the cb receptors initially defined as peripheral receptors, may contribute to anti-anxiolytic effects  <cit> . cb <dig> receptors are distributed over several regions of the central nervous system  <cit>  and the non-selective cb agonist cp seems to provide agonistic effects as well as against cb <dig> receptors. with respect to the effects of am and vd, agonistic effects on the gpr <dig> receptor subtype, a newly-identified g protein coupled cb receptor subtype, have also been reported  <cit> . although the behavioral roles of gpr <dig> receptors have not been investigated, it is possible that gpr <dig> distributed in the brain  <cit>  may participate in cognitive processes such as working memory. furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrated that vd acted as a partial agonist on gpr <dig> receptors and provided antagonistic effects at high concentrations  <cit> , whereas only full agonistic effects have been reported for am  <cit> . on the other hand, on cb <dig> receptors, both vd and am provided antagonistic effects at high concentrations  <cit> . these characteristic effects of the partial agonist/antagonist vd as a gpr <dig> antagonist at high concentrations may be correlated with its limited and non-dose-dependent ameliorating effects against working memory impairments, i.e. only  <dig> mg/kg vd, but not a lower  or higher  dose, was effective. in addition to gpr <dig>  the existence of other yet-to-be-cloned cb receptors has been suggested in memory-related brain regions such as the hippocampus  <cit> . there may be some contributions of these receptors to the am- and vd-derived attenuating effects against the nc- and/or im-induced working memory impairments.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrated working memory impairment- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by nc, im and nc-im treatments in mice. mutual synergistic effects for nc plus im were observed for both types of behavioral alterations. in the present study, the involvement of endocannabinoid system was also shown in the processes of working memory and anxiety. however, between the working memory- and anxiety-related behavioral alterations, discrepancies in the types of effective cb ligands were observed: the cb <dig> antagonist am was the most effective against the working memory impairment-related behaviors, whereas the cb <dig> partial agonist/antagonist vd was the most effective against the anxiety-related behaviors. since the presence of new cb receptor subtypes such as gpr <dig> receptors has been clarified recently and the interactions with each cb ligand have been suggested, further research into the therapeutic contributions of each cb receptor subtype is expected.
