BACKGROUND
antihistaminergic drugs are commonly classified into three generations. first generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, effectively block the h <dig> receptor subtype but their use is limited due to significant central  and peripheral  antimuscarinic side effects. second generation antihistamines, such as loratadine, retain a high selectivity for the h <dig> receptor and have fewer centrally mediated side effects than the first generation compounds because second generation compounds do not readily enter the central nervous system   <cit> . however, two second generation antihistamines, astemizole and terfenadine, cause prolongation of the qt interval resulting in torsades de pointes. this adverse effect prompted the removal of terfenadine from the drug market  <cit> . the most recent, third generation compounds, include fexofenadine and desloratadine. these compounds are active metabolites of the second generation antihistamines, terfenadine and loratadine, respectively, and generally retain or surpass the h <dig> receptor selectivity of their parent compounds. for instance, desloratadine displays a higher affinity for the h <dig> receptor than does loratadine and antagonizes the human h <dig> receptor in a pseudoirreversible manner  <cit> .

questions remain concerning the potential for antimuscarinic adverse effects with desloratadine since both in vitro and in vivo experimentation indicates that desloratadine has the ability to block muscarinic receptors. desloratadine demonstrated in vitro ic <dig> values of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm against cloned human m <dig> and m <dig> muscarinic receptor subtypes, respectively  <cit> . in vivo muscarinic receptor blockade has been demonstrated in that desloratadine has been shown to inhibit pilocarpine induced salivation in mice and inhibit contractions of isolated rabbit and guinea pig iris smooth muscle  <cit> . therefore, these data present the need to more definitively ascertain the potential antimuscarinic activity of desloratadine, in vivo. in the present study, several in vivo models were used to further assess antimuscarinic activity of desloratadine as well as the potential for penetration of the blood-brain barrier.

RESULTS
oxotremorine-induced tremor
intraperitoneal injection of oxotremorine  induced tremor in conscious mice. the only dose of desloratadine causing inhibition of oxotremorine-induced tremor was  <dig>  mg/kg . desloratadine  did not significantly inhibit generation of tremor. unlike atropine sulfate , atropine methyl nitrate  did not inhibit tremors which confirms the central locus for oxotremorine-induced tremors. diphenhydramine  significantly inhibited the generation of tremor by oxotremorine as did administration of both 4-damp  and methoctramine  prior to administration of oxotremorine.

oxotremorine-induced tremor with phenylephrine pretreatment
pretreatment with the vasopressor agent, phenylephrine , functions to disrupt the blood-brain barrier by inducing acute hypertension  <cit> . blood-brain barrier disruption resulted in significant inhibition of oxotremorine-induced tremors by desloratadine  compared to the 1% dmso vehicle as reflected by their respective total tremor scores . pretreatment with pe followed by administration of desloratadine  elicited an oxotremorine-induced total tremor score of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   whereas pe pretreatment followed by vehicle elicited an oxotremorine-induced total tremor score of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

oxotremorine-induced salivation and lacrimation
administration of oxotremorine  elicited salivation in conscious and urethane-anesthetized mice. in conscious mice, oxotremorine-induced salivation was not significantly inhibited by pretreatment with desloratadine  . however, salivation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with atropine , atropine methyl nitrate , and 4-damp . pretreatment with methoctramine  and diphenhydramine  failed to inhibit oxotremorine-induced salivation.

inhibition of oxotremorine-induced salivation in urethane-anesthetized mice yielded results similar to those obtained in conscious male icr mice. pretreatment with desloratadine  failed to significantly inhibit oxotremorine-induced salivation . as in the conscious animal, pretreatment with atropine  and 4-damp  significantly inhibited oxotremorine-induced salivation. also, administration of diphenhydramine  and methoctramine  failed to significantly inhibit saliva production.

desloratadine  pretreatment had no significant effect on oxotremorine-induced lacrimation in conscious mice . as with inhibition of salivation in the conscious animal, pretreatment with atropine  and 4-damp  significantly inhibited oxotremorine-induced lacrimation. pretreatment with either methoctramine  or diphenhydramine  did not significantly inhibit oxotremorine-induced lacrimation.

oxotremorine-induced changes in left ventricular contractility
intravenous injections of oxotremorine  elicited biphasic inotropic responses. the initial phase consisted of a dose-dependent decrease in dp/dt. this decrease in inotropy began approximately 30– <dig> seconds after the beginning of oxotremorine injection and lasted for approximately  <dig> seconds. both desloratadine and methoctramine treatments effectively blocked the negative inotropic effect . administration of desloratadine  significantly inhibited oxotremorine-induced  decreases in dp/dt indicated by a shift in the dose-response curve to the right. also, administration of methoctramine  significantly inhibited oxotremorine-induced  decreases in dp/dt indicated by a shift in the dose-response curve to the right. after administration of test agents, an additional dose of oxotremorine  was administered causing percentage decreases in left ventricular  contractility of - <dig>  ±  <dig> , - <dig>  ±  <dig> , and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  for desloratadine, 4-damp, and methoctramine treatments, respectively . treatment with 4-damp had little antagonistic effect on the negative inotropic response to oxotremorine.

the second phase of the inotropic response to oxotremorine consisted of a dose-dependent increase in dp/dt. this increase immediately followed the initial decrease and had a duration of 2– <dig> minutes. both desloratadine and 4-damp antagonized the oxotremorine-induced positive inotropic effect . administration of desloratadine  significantly inhibited oxotremorine-induced  increases in dp/dt indicated by a shift in the dose-response curve to the right. also, administration of 4-damp  significantly inhibited oxotremorine-induced  increases in dp/dt indicated by a shift in the dose-response curve to the right. in contrast to desloratadine and 4-damp, methoctramine treatment  resulted in a statistically significant  increases in dp/dt after oxotremorine  administration compared to control values recorded prior to methoctramine treatment. after administration of test agents, an additional dose of oxotremorine  was administered causing percentage increases in lv contractility of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for desloratadine, 4-damp, and methoctramine treatments, respectively .

oxotremorine-induced bradycardia
administration of oxotremorine caused a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate. all three of the test agents antagonized this decrease as indicated by a shift in the dose-response curve to the right . after administration of all three test agents, the negative chronotropic effects of oxotremorine  were significantly inhibited. treatment with desloratadine  or 4-damp  also significantly inhibited the negative chronotropic response to oxotremorine  while methoctramine  treatment inhibited the response to oxotremorine . after administration of test agents, an additional dose of oxotremorine  was administered causing percentage decreases in heart rate of - <dig>  ±  <dig> , - <dig>  ±  <dig>  and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  for desloratadine, 4-damp, and methoctramine treatments, respectively .

inhibition of baroreceptor reflex
the ability of desloratadine to significantly alter the baroreceptor reflex was assessed in the conscious rat. data were expressed as the percent change from corresponding control values of blood pressure and heart rate and subsequently analyzed by linear regression. the mean slope values were then analyzed for significant differences . administration of desloratadine  prior to stimulation of the baroreceptor reflex resulted in a slope value of - <dig>  ±  <dig>   with the corresponding control slope value of - <dig>  ±  <dig>   which was not a statistically significant difference. unlike desloratadine, administration of atropine  prior to stimulation of the baroreceptor reflex resulted in a slope value of - <dig>  ±  <dig>   with the corresponding control slope value of - <dig>  ±  <dig>   which was a statistically significant difference .

discussion
the focus of the present experiments was to determine the degree of antimuscarinic effects exerted by desloratadine at m <dig> and m <dig> receptors, in vivo. the non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, oxotremorine  <cit> , was employed as the challenge agent in the murine and rat models. relatively selective antagonists at the m <dig> and m <dig> receptors, methoctramine  <cit>  and 4-damp  <cit> , respectively, were used for comparison. our results indicate the third generation antihistaminergic agent, desloratadine, possesses a significant degree of antimuscarinic activity, primarily against cardiac m <dig> and m <dig> receptor subtypes, using in vivo whole animal preparations. however, the doses at which these activities are demonstrated exceed those normally utilized for therapeutic antihistaminergic effects. in addition, while penetration of the blood-brain barrier by desloratadine is unlikely to occur at therapeutic doses  <cit> , evidence has been obtained suggesting penetration can be achieved and result in significant central antimuscarinic effects if the blood-brain barrier is compromised by administration of a vasopressor agent.

oxotremorine-induced tremor, salivation, and lacrimation in the mouse have been used by others to evaluate the presence of antimuscarinic actions of drugs of interest  <cit> . the elicitation of tremor by oxotremorine is centrally mediated  <cit>  and blockade of this response gauges penetration of an antimuscarinic agent across the blood-brain barrier. thus, blockade of oxotremorine-induced tremor is indirectly indicative of the potential for an antimuscarinic agent to exert central actions, such as sedation, following peripheral administration. in the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier, desloratadine did not exert significant blockade of oxotremorine-induced tremor, except at the highest dose tested  which caused roughly 30% reduction in tremor severity. in contrast, following treatment with the vasopressor agent, phenylephrine, to open the blood-brain barrier, a previously ineffective dose of desloratadine  caused a 60% reduction in tremor severity. these data suggest that while desloratadine is unlikely to exert central antimuscarinic effects at therapeutic dosages  in normal adults, considerably greater cns penetration may occur when the blood-brain barrier is compromised. the significance of this when desloratadine is combined with a vasopressor decongestant or when infection may compromise the blood-brain barrier  <cit>  remains for further study. the present results showing blockade by pretreatment with either methoctramine or 4-damp, indicate that oxotremorine-induced tremor is mediated by both m <dig> and m <dig> receptors in the mouse as has been previously demonstrated by others  <cit> .

both oxotremorine-induced lacrimation  <cit>  and salivation  <cit>  have been shown to be mediated selectively through the m <dig> receptor subtype, a mediation confirmed by the present study. thus, while methoctramine pretreatment had no effect on either variable, 4-damp pretreatment was capable of reducing both lacrimation and salivation by 60–80% below control responses. in direct contrast, desloratadine inhibited neither lacrimation nor salivation at doses as high as  <dig> mg/kg.

the pithed, atenolol-treated rat provides a useful acute model with which to examine antimuscarinic drug action on the circulatory system in the absence of both basal and phasic sympathetic nervous system influences. the administration of oxotremorine, in this model elicits dose-dependent bradycardia, and biphasic effects on cardiac inotropy. oxotremorine causes an initial decline in contractility, as determined by ventricular dp/dt, followed by a more prolonged positive inotropic phase. this biphasic inotropic response to a muscarinic agonist has been previously reported for acetylcholine, bethanechol, and carbachol in a variety of experimental species  <cit> .

the rat heart contains multiple muscarinic receptors, including the m <dig>  <cit> , m <dig>  <cit> , and m <dig>  <cit>  subtypes. of these, the m <dig> subtype predominates based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  data indicating the m <dig> subtype constitutes more than 90% of the total muscarinic receptor mrna, therefore, supporting its role as the major mediator of muscarinic influence over the functional state of the myocardium  <cit> . however, krejci and tucek also demonstrated the presence of mrna for m <dig> and m <dig> subtypes, each constituting less than 1% and 3%, respectively, of the total muscarinic receptor mrna in the rat heart  <cit> . m <dig> receptor agonists elicit bradycardia and a negative inotropic response through inhibition of cardiac adenylyl cyclase and/or an increase in potassium conductance via the muscarinic potassium channel  <cit> . in contrast, effects mediated through the m <dig> and/or m <dig> receptors may lead to increased contractile strength, through enhanced activity of phospholipase c and subsequent downstream events leading to increased intracellular free calcium availability  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  have recently reviewed the existence of multiple muscarinic receptors in the mammalian myocardium and have emphasized the presence of and physiological functions exerted by m <dig> receptors. a lesser body of data supports functional actions of the m <dig> subtype.

desloratadine, at a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg, effectively antagonized bradycardia and both negative and positive inotropic responses elicited by oxotremorine. assuming adequate selectivity between cardiac muscarinic receptor subtypes, our data suggest the ability of methoctramine to blunt oxotremorine-induced negative inotropic event and the ability of 4-damp to blunt oxotremorine-induced positive inotropic event to be indicative of m <dig> and m <dig> receptor mediation of these phenomena, respectively. in contrast, however, both methoctramine  and 4-damp  blunted oxotremorine-induced bradycardia. therefore, the possibility exists that oxotremorine-induced bradycardia is mediated by both m <dig> and m <dig> receptor subtypes.

the context in which the present results are taken is worthy of discussion. both in vitro receptor binding data  <cit>  and results from prior in vivo studies  <cit>  demonstrate a considerably greater affinity of desloratadine for histaminergic than muscarinic receptors . desloratadine has been found to exhibit a peak plasma concentration of approximately  <dig> ng/ml in healthy volunteers following a therapeutic antihistaminic dose of its parent compound, loratadine  <cit> . single oral doses of desloratadine of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> mg yielded peak plasma concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ng/l in human volunteers  <cit> . in mice, desloratadine exhibits an ed <dig> of  <dig>  mg/kg in reduction of histamine induced paw edema  <cit> . cardelus et al.  <cit>  noted local antimuscarinic effects following topical ocular administration of 1– <dig> mg/ml of desloratadine. however, it is unlikely that systemic concentrations of desloratadine would rise to levels approaching those in the present study following normal therapeutic dosages of desloratadine, a fact which has been emphasized by others  <cit> . thus, the antimuscarinic actions of desloratadine demonstrated in the present study would, most probably, be of significance only in overdose situations.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that, at doses greater than those recommended for antihistaminergic therapy, desloratadine causes significant blockade of cardiac m <dig> and possibly cardiac m <dig> receptors, in vivo. this was demonstrated by significant inhibition of oxotremorine-mediated positive and negative inotropic events and bradycardia by desloratadine in the pithed rat. in contrast, desloratadine does not significantly antagonize the m <dig> receptor subtype responsible for salivation and lacrimation as demonstrated by the compound's inability to inhibit oxotremorine-mediated salivation and lacrimation in the conscious mouse and lacrimation in the anesthetized mouse. also, under normal physiological conditions, desloratadine does not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. however, upon disruption of this barrier, desloratadine has the potential for cns penetration and muscarinic receptor blockade.
