BACKGROUND
during embryogenesis, the formation of blood vessels is accomplished by two distinct processes called vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. in the former process, angioblasts derived from the lateral plate mesoderm migrate and differentiate into endothelial cells, thereby forming endothelial tube and primary vessels. and then the latter process involves the sprouting of new vessels from these primary vessels and their proper remodeling  <cit> .

vegf  is well known to have critical roles in the formation of blood vessels  <cit> . it affects not only the differentiation of angioblasts and the formation of endothelial tube during vasculogenesis but also the degradation of extracellular matrix and the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells during angiogenesis  <cit> . some evidence shows that hif- <dig> , a critical factor expressed in hypoxic condition, is involved in the induction of vegf  <cit> . in addition, recent studies using some cultured cells have showed that tgfβ could induce vegf gene  <cit> . however, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism by which vegf induction is regulated in vivo, despite its pivotal effects on blood vessel formation.

during xenopus development, flk- <dig>  a vegf receptor, is expressed in endothelial precursor cells which will form the major blood vessels including the posterior cardinal veins , the dorsal aorta  and the vitelline veins, and vegf is localized in tissues, such as hypochord  <dig> and somites, adjacent to the flk- <dig> expressing endothelial precursors  <cit> . after establishment of the primary vasculatures, flk- <dig> expression is also observed in the intersomitic veins  formed by angiogenesis. these results suggest a role for vegf/flk- <dig> signaling in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in xenopus early embryos. supporting this possibility, ectopic expression of vegf by injection of either plasmid dna or synthetic mrna altered the architecture of developing vasculature  <cit> . in addition, ectopic vegf could act as a chemoattractant for angioblasts, suggesting that localized sources of vegf play a role in patterning the embryonic vessels  <cit> .

disabled  was first known as a factor to affect the neuronal development of drosophila  <cit> . and then disabled- <dig> , one of its mammalian isoforms, which contains an n-terminal ptb domain and a c-terminal prd  <cit> , was identified as a cytosolic adaptor regulating endocytosis  <cit> . dab2-null mice reveal that it has significant roles in endodermal cell positioning and structure formation of the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm during early embryogenesis, and in adult kidney function  <cit> . it was also suggested that dab <dig> could be a tumor suppressor since its expression level, which is maintained in normal ovarian cells, is remarkably decreased in ovarian carcinoma cells  <cit> . moreover, dab <dig> acts as an adaptor to link tgfβ receptor to smad <dig> or smad <dig> resulting in the promotion of tgfβ signaling pathway  <cit> , whereas it regulates negatively the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway  <cit> .

in our initial attempt to address the function of dab <dig> in xenopus early development, we unexpectedly found that its expression is specifically restricted to blood vessels. inhibition of dab <dig> function or activin-like signaling in xenopus early embryos disrupted the intersomitic veins arising from angiogenesis. interestingly, its knockdown specifically inhibited the induction of vegf gene with no effects on that of other target genes by activin-like signals. we also found that defects in intersomitic veins caused by dab <dig> depletion could be rescued by coexpression of vegf. therefore, we suggest in this study that dab <dig> plays pivotal roles in embryonic angiogenesis by acting as a mediator of activin-like signaling pathway for vegf induction.

RESULTS
xenopus dab <dig> is expressed in embryonic vasculature
to investigate the function of dab <dig> in xenopus early embryos, we first cloned a xenopus orthologue of disabled- <dig>  by using pcr-based method and sequence information in est database. xenopus disabled- <dig>  cdna consists of  <dig> nucleotides which encode a protein of  <dig> amino acids . the predicted amino acid sequence of our clone is more similar to dab <dig> orthologues of other vertebrates than dab <dig> . like other orthologues, it contains both n-terminal phosphotyrosine binding  domain  and c-terminal proline-rich domain . ptb and prd domains show over 87% and 40% identity, respectively, across species. furthermore, sequence alignment reveals that xdab <dig> is most similar to the short splicing isoforms  of mammalian dab <dig> , which lack the motifs required for dab <dig> to act as an adaptor for endocytosis in vivo.

xdab <dig> amino acid sequence is more homologous to other vertebrate dab <dig> than to dab <dig> and is most similar to short splicing isoforms of mammalian dab <dig>  as shown here.

we next examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of xdab <dig> . rt-pcr analysis showed both its maternal and zygotic transcriptions throughout early development . particularly, it increased gradually after the late neurula stages. spatially, it was weakly expressed in the animal hemisphere at the cleavage stages  and around the anterior border of neural plate and somitic region at the neurula  and tailbud stages . at the late tailbud stages, xdab <dig> is found in vitelline vein networks . as development proceeds, it appeared in the pronephric sinus and posterior cardinal veins  and concomitantly disappeared in the somites. during the tadpole stages, its specific and strong transcriptions were observed in the vasculatures including vascular vitelline vein networks , anterior cardinal veins , common cardinal veins , pronephric sinus , posterior cardinal veins  and intersomitic veins  .

overexpression of xdab <dig> affects the formation of intersomitic veins
based on its spatial localization to vascular structures, we focused on the function of xdab <dig> in the formation of blood vessels during xenopus early development. thus, we first examined the effects of gain-of-xdab <dig> function on the formation of vascular structures in early embryos. to this end, we overexpressed xdab <dig> mrna in one blastomere of 2-cell stage embryos and then observed its effects on vascular formation by hybridizing against xmsr or ephb <dig>  endothelial specific markers of xenopus embryo  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the formation of intersomitic veins  was disrupted on the injected side of xdab2-overexpressed embryos  in a dose-dependent manner . however, injection of β-gal rna had no effects on the growth of isv in negative control embryos . since xdab <dig> is a short splicing form, we also tested whether the long splicing form of dab <dig> could affect isv formation. interestingly, overexpression of long splicing form of human dab <dig>  or mouse dab <dig>  in xenopus embryos also impeded isv formation . the intersomitic veins are formed by sprouting angiogenesis  <cit> . in xenopus, they appear from stage  <dig> on by sprouting from the posterior cardinal vein and growing dorsally into the spaces that separate individual somites  <cit> . together, these results suggest that both of splicing forms of dab <dig> may have conserved functions in isv formation or angiogenesis.

xdab <dig> knockdown leads to defects in blood vessel formation
in order to address whether xdab <dig> is indispensable for isv formation, we next carried out the loss-of-function analysis by using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides  capable of depleting xdab <dig> protein  <cit> . we designed two morpholino oligonucleotides  which target different regions of xdab <dig> gene to disrupt the translation of xdab <dig> mrna .

to confirm the efficacy and targeting specificity of xdab <dig> mos, we first coinjected the mos with c-terminally myc-tagged xdab <dig> rnas with or without mo targeting sites in four-cell stage embryos, cultured until stage  <dig> , and performed the western blot analysis with the anti-myc antibody . coinjection of either mo <dig> or mo <dig> inhibited effectively the production of xdab2-myc protein from rnas that contain 5' untranslated region  encoding mo targeting sites but not that from rnas devoid of 5' utr. control mo  had no effects on the production of xdab2-myc, regardless of whether rnas include mo targeting sites or not. overall, these indicate the ability of xdab <dig> mo to block specifically the production of xenopus dab <dig> protein.

we next examined the effects of xdab <dig> depletion on isv formation. one blastomere of two-cell stage embryo was injected with xdab <dig> mo  or co mo, and the sprouting isv was observed by hybridizing against endothelial markers at the tadpole stages. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the sprouting intersomitic veins were absent on the injected side  of xdab <dig> mo-injected embryos as visualized by xmsr or ephb <dig> endothelial markers. and these angiogenic defects could be rescued by coexpression of xdab <dig>  human dab <dig>  or mouse dab <dig>  mrna, which cannot bind to mo and is resistant to translation inhibition . this indicates the specific effects of xdab <dig> mo on the formation of isv and the functional conservation of splicing forms of dab <dig> across species. however, co mo had no effects on the sprouting isv . moreover, we performed microangiography to examine the blood circulation in xdab2-depleted embryos at the later stages   <cit> . in this experiment, we found that mo-mediated knockdown of xdab <dig> could lead to abnormality in blood supply, causing the leak  or absence  of intersomitic veins while co mo-injected embryos show normal circulation . this indicates that consistent with the angiogenic defects shown by endothelial markers' expression at the earlier stages, xdab <dig> depletion ultimately can disrupt blood circulation at the advanced stages. furthermore, we also investigated the effects of xdab <dig> depletion on the vasculogenic processes including the formation of posterior cardinal vein  and vitelline vein networks  . pcv  and vvn  in a series of embryo sections were absent or decreased on the xdab <dig> mo-injected side. taken together, these results indicate that dab <dig> is essential for vasculogenesis as well as angiogenesis during xenopus early development.

disturbance of activin-like signaling leads to defects in isv formation
tgfβ is known to induce the expression of vegf, a key molecule in angiogenesis in some cultured cells  <cit> . thus, we next investigated whether tgfβ or similar signaling pathways would be involved in embryonic angiogenesis during xenopus development. for this purpose, constitutively active activin receptor   <cit> , dominant negative activin receptor   <cit> , dominant negative smad <dig>  or dominant negative smad <dig>   <cit>  dna was injected into one blastomere of two-cell stage embryos and then their effects on isv formation was examined by in situ hybridization analysis using xmsr probe . we excluded embryos exhibiting abnormal morphology which is probably due to the effect of other functions of activin-like signaling pathway during embryogenesis but analyzed normal-looking embryos at early tadpole stages. in these analyses, injection of ca halk <dig> or dn halk <dig> caused defects in isv formation on the injected side of embryos to a similar degree . in addition, functional inhibition of smad <dig>  a downstream effector of tgfβ signaling, by expression of dn smad <dig> disrupted the sprouting of isv . dn smad <dig> had also inhibitory effects on isv formation, but to a lesser extent than dn smad <dig>  overall, these data suggest that activin-like signaling may affect on normal embryonic angiogenesis during xenopus early development.

activin-like signaling regulates isv formation through xdab2-mediated vegf induction
our results revealed that xdab <dig> and activin-like signal are essential for isv formation in developing early embryos. since dab <dig> acts as an adaptor to mediate tgfβ signaling pathway  <cit> , we next examined whether xdab <dig> might function downstream of activin-like signaling pathway to mediate vegf gene expression for the regulation of blood vessel formation. to this end, we first performed rt-pcr analysis to test whether xdab <dig> mediates the induction of vegf by activin-like signal . functional analysis in xenopus animal caps showed that injection of constitutively active activin receptor  could induce vegf gene, and this induction could be interfered by coexpression of xdab <dig> mo. co mo, however, did not affect the expression of vegf. we also carried out this analysis using xnr <dig> , a ligand of nodal signaling, with the same result . together, these results suggest that xdab <dig> may mediate the induction of vegf by activin-like signaling. furthermore, we examined whether xdab <dig> depletion also inhibit the expression of endogenous vegf in whole embryos. for this purpose, we injected co mo or xdab <dig> mo into one blastomere of two-cell stage embryos and then performed in situ hybridization analysis using vegf probe  <cit>  at the embryonic stages just prior to the formation of blood vessels including pcv and isv . vegf gene expression was decreased markedly on the injected side of xdab <dig> mo-injected embryos  whereas it was unchanged in the co mo-injected embryos . since overexpression of dab <dig> or dn halk <dig> could inhibit isv formation as shown above, we also examined their effects on the expression of endogenous vegf. as shown in fig. 5d and 5e, injection of xdab <dig> or hdab <dig> did not induce significant changes in vegf expression, though a small percentage of injected embryos exhibited its increased pattern . in contrast, dn halk4-mediated inhibition of activin-like signaling suppressed vegf expression . overall, these data suggest that dab2-mediated activin-like signaling is essential for vegf expression in vivo during xenopus development.

as vegf has a key role in angiogenesis, we next asked whether the xdab2-mediated induction of vegf is relevant to isv formation in xenopus early embryos. to test this, we examined whether the angiogenic defects caused by xdab <dig> depletion could be rescued by coexpression of vegf . in this experiment, injection of xdab <dig> mo inhibited the formation of intersomitic veins as described above , and this inhibition could be rescued by coinjection of xenopus vegf mrna  <cit>  . these data indicate that the xdab2-mediated induction of vegf may regulate the growth of intersomitic veins in early embryos.

activin-like signals have a variety of roles during the patterning of xenopus early embryos, and many other target genes as well as vegf are induced by these signals in animal caps. we thus tested whether xdab <dig> also mediates the induction of other target genes by activin-like signals . intriguingly, our results showed that xdab <dig> mo inhibited the induction of late mesodermal markers including vegf and muscle actin , but not that of endodermal markers including endodermin  or sox <dig> genes by expression of ca halk <dig> in animal caps . in addition, xdab <dig> depletion did not affect the induction of earlier mesodermal markers such as xbra, chordin and mix <dig> by activin-like signals . consistently, xdab <dig> could enhance the activity of activin ligand in the induction of vegf gene only, but not in that of other target genes . these results suggest that xdab <dig> may function as a specific adaptor to induce vegf downstream of activin-like signaling pathway.

discussion
in this study, we have demonstrated that activin-like signaling pathway is implicated in angiogenesis in xenopus early embryos and dab <dig> acts as a specific mediator for this process. first, xenopus dab <dig> is specifically expressed in vasculatures of early embryos including intersomitic veins . second, overexpression and depletion of xdab <dig> interferes with the sprouting of isv. in addition, the up- and down-regulation of activin-like signaling by expression of ca halk <dig>  dn halk <dig>  dn smad <dig> or dn smad <dig> affects the formation of isv. finally, xdab <dig> is required for the induction by activin-like signals of vegf, a critical angiogenic factor, with no effects on that of other target genes. together, these results suggest the possible signaling cascade that regulates the early vascular development in vertebrates.

angiogenic defects caused by the gain- and loss-of-function of xdab2
our results show that both overexpression and knockdown of xdab <dig> can cause the disappearance of the intersomitic veins . this angiogenic defect by xdab <dig> depletion may be due to the loss of xdab2-mediated vegf expression. consistent with this, analysis of heterozygous vegf mutant embryos, which are less affected than those homozygous for this mutation, revealed a strong decrease in isv sprouts  <cit> . moreover, even loss of a single vegf allele results in embryonic lethality at e <dig> , indicating a strict dose-dependent regulation of embryonic blood vessel development by vegf  <cit> . then, the next question to address is how the absence of the sprouting isv could be caused by xdab <dig> overexpression, although several molecules involved in embryonic angiogenesis show similar phenotypes in the gain-and loss-of-function analysis  <cit> . two possibilities could account for this finding. first, vegf increased by xdab <dig> may interfere with the formation of angiogenic vessels. in quail embryogenesis, the intersomitic arteries in the vegf-injected halves were either missing or stunted, whereas in the uninjected halves, the intersomitic and vertebral vessel development was normal  <cit> . this indicates that ectopic expression of vegf could induce angiogenic defects. in addition, loss of alk <dig>  which is a member of tgfβ type i receptors and activates smad1/5/ <dig> effectors, leads to up-regulation of angiogenic factors such as vegf and ang- <dig> . nevertheless, alk <dig> knockout mice exhibited defective angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cell development, although endothelial differentiation and vasculogenesis appear normal  <cit> . second, it is possible that up-regulation of activin-like signaling by overexpression of xdab <dig> may induce anti-angiogenic factors as well as vegf. tgfβ can both stimulate and inhibit proliferation of endothelial cells. low doses of tgfβ stimulate proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, while high doses of tgfβ inhibit these responses  <cit> . recent evidence has shown that tgfβ signaling could induce both the angiogenic molecule, vegf, and the anti-angiogenic molecules such as thrombospondin- <dig> , known as a major antiangiogenic factor, and soluble flt- <dig> , which is a soluble receptor and antagonist of vegf  <cit> . in light of this, it is tempting to speculate that xdab2-promoted activin-like signaling may stimulate the expression of anti-angiogenic factors in xenopus early embryos, and then these factors could inhibit the function of vegf. the role of anti-angiogenic factors including tsp- <dig> and sflt- <dig> and their relationship with activin-like signaling in angiogenesis during xenopus early development remain to be investigated.

dab2-mediated activin-like signaling in angiogenesis
our gain- and loss-of-function analysis of activin-like signaling suggests its possible role in angiogenesis at later stages of xenopus early development. consistently, depletion of tgfβ and its receptors has demonstrated the critical role of tgfβ signaling in vascular development. tgfβ1-deficient mice die in utero due to vascular defects  <cit>  and loss of tgfβ type i or type ii receptor in mice results in embryonic lethality at around e <dig>  due to defects in vascular development of the yolk sac  <cit> . in addition, several reports have shown that tgfβ signaling induces vegf gene expression in cultured cells  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of vegf gene expression in whole organisms are poorly understood.

dab <dig> is known to function as a component of tgfβ signaling by linking tgfβ receptors and smad proteins in cultured cells  <cit> . this suggests the possibility that xdab <dig> regulates embryonic angiogenesis through activin-like signaling pathway. supporting this hypothesis, unlike wild-type xdab <dig>  its mutant devoid of ptb domain, which mediates its interaction with tgfβ receptors and smad2/ <dig>  could not inhibit the sprouting of isv when overexpressed in early embryos . moreover, xdab <dig> is not only required for but also capable of augmenting the ability of activin signal to induce vegf gene . these results indicate that xdab <dig> lies in the activin-like signaling cascade for the regulation of the angiogenic events. interestingly, our results reveal that depletion of xdab <dig> affect the induction by activin signals of vegf and ma genes, but not that of other early and late target genes . given the expression of xdab <dig> in the somites and vascular structures of early embryo, this indicates that dab2-mediated activin-like signaling may be involved in somite tissue specification as well as angiogenesis. however, since activin-like signaling could affect the late mesoderm specification in the somites that is critical for blood vessel formation, we cannot exclude the possibility that it could have indirect effects on vascular development. nevertheless, it is worth noting that activin-like signaling employs specific mediators such as dab <dig> only for the late specific developmental events but not for the early ones in xenopus embryos. in line with this, the gain- and loss-of-function of xdab <dig> had no effects on the axis formation and patterning of early embryos that are regulated by wnt and activin-like signaling pathway , though it is also known as an inhibitor of wnt signaling  <cit> , indicating its specific function in late mesoderm specification and angiogenesis as shown our data in xenopus development. although it is known that other adaptor proteins such as sara  <cit> , dok- <dig>  <cit> , axin  <cit> , the elf β-spectrin  <cit>  and cpml  <cit>  are involved in tgfβ signaling pathway, it remains to be further investigated whether these adaptors also function in angiogenesis or other specific events regulated by tgfβ signaling in whole organisms.

functional conservation of dab <dig> in blood vessel development
during mouse embryogenesis, mouse dab <dig>  expression is first observed in the primitive endoderm at e <dig>  and it is still restricted to the visceral endoderm at e <dig>   <cit> . the homozygous dab2-deficient mutant is embryonic lethal  due to the defective visceral endoderm formation  <cit> . the conditional null mice for dab <dig> show defects in kidney function such as reduction of transport by megalin, a lipoprotein receptor, in the proximal tubule, but the kidney appeared grossly normal, despite the absence of dab <dig> protein that is normally expressed in the kidney proximal tubule cells  <cit> . dab <dig> is also highly expressed in a variety of adult tissues, including the kidney, ovary, liver, mammary gland, intestine, uterus and heart  <cit> . dab <dig> conditionally null mice also appeared normal when dab2-expressing organs such as kidney, intestine and brain were analyzed  <cit> . however, there is no report that mdab <dig> is involved in angiogenesis during mouse embryogenesis yet. although these embryonic roles of mdab <dig> in mouse embryogenesis seem to differ from those of xdab <dig> in many respects, we think that the function of mdab <dig> in angiogenesis needs to be investigated in the future research. on the other hand, a recent study reported that zebrafish dab <dig>  is expressed in caudal vein  and dorsal aorta   <cit> , indicating its possible roles in blood vessel development. furthermore, we showed that the angiogenic defects by xdab <dig> knockdown could be rescued by either human or mouse dab <dig> genes . together, these results suggest that the angiogenic function of dab <dig> may be conserved during vertebrate development.

dab <dig> has two splicing variants including long  and short  forms in mammals. compared with the long variant in mice, the short one lacks the exon  <dig> containing two dpf and two of five npf motifs which are implicated in endocytosis. while p <dig> isoform is essential for normal endocytosis and mouse development, expression of p <dig> alone led to decreased endocytosis and delayed development  <cit> , suggesting their distinct functions. nevertheless, our study reveals that both of splicing isoforms have similar functions in blood vessel development.

supporting this, both of long and short splicing isoforms of dab <dig> disrupted similarly the sprouting of intersomitic veins when overexpressed. moreover, the angiogenic defects caused by xdab <dig> depletion could be recovered by coinjection of either. thus, it is tempting to speculate that the motifs critical for endocytosis which the long splicing isoform has might be dispensable for blood vessel formation. possibly, dab <dig> could function as a signaling mediator but not as an adaptor for endocytosis in the angiogenic events. on the other hand, it is possible that overexpression of short splicing isoforms such as xdab <dig> can inhibit the isv formation by competing off the long isoforms which might be more relevant to blood vessel formation. however, given that overexpression of xdab <dig> cannot reduce vegf expression that is critical for angiogenesis , its inhibitory effects on the isv formation might not be due to the impediment of the long isoform's function. like xdab <dig>  zebrafish dab <dig> expressed in blood vessels is more similar to short isoforms than long ones . probably, in lower vertebrates such as fish and frog, a short isoform of dab <dig> alone may play the same roles that its two isoforms have in human and mice during blood vessel development. in the future, it will be necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which dab <dig> regulates vegf expression in activin-like signaling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our study shows that dab <dig> has a pivotal role in embryonic angiogenesis during xenopus early development. in this process, it functions as a specific mediator of vegf induction by activin-like signaling pathway. the detailed mechanism governing the function of dab <dig> in vasculature, its significance in pathological angiogenesis, and its functional conservation in other vertebrate development remain to be elucidated.
