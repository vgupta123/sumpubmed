BACKGROUND
crispr /cas  has recently emerged as an effective genome editing system for modifying genes in a wide range of organisms, including humans, animals, bacteria and plants . the system has three types: i, ii, and iii, and maintains high specificity through canonical watson-crick base pairing of guide rnas to the target sites. type ii uses cas <dig> nucleases and is the most useful system demonstrated so far  <cit>  due to the unique properties of the enzymes. a cas <dig> nuclease can be guided by crispr to a targeted protospacer region, located at the upstream of a protospacer-adjacent motif . then, the cas <dig> nuclease can induce precise cleavages at the endogenous genomic locus resulting in dna deletion and other changes at the locus  <cit> . in addition, the cas <dig> nuclease can be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with mutagenic activity  <cit> . these properties of crispr/cas <dig> make the system a valuable and versatile tool for many research applications  <cit> .

successful examples of using the crispr/cas <dig> system for various genome-editing purposes are accumulating at a fast pace. the system was used to introduce precise mutations into the genomes of streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli in  <dig>  <cit> , which demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of the technique for bacterial genome engineering. subsequently, the crispr/cas <dig> system of prokaryotic streptococcus pyogenes was employed as programmable rna-guided endonucleases to cleave dna in a targeted manner for genome editing in human and mouse cells  <cit> . now, various tool kits with vectors carrying pgreen or pcambia backbones, which can facilitate transient or stable expression of the crispr/cas <dig> system, have been developed for multiplex gene editing in plants  <cit> . genes from many plant species, including arabidopsis thaliana, triticum aestivum, lycopersicon esculentum, citrus sinensis and nicotiana, have been successfully edited by using the crispr/cas <dig> system . furthermore, several databases and web tools have been established to facilitate related studies .

grape is one of the most important fruit crops in the world, and its draft genome sequence was first released in  <dig> by assembling eight-fold shotgun sequences and later improved by increasing the coverage to 12-fold  <cit> . because of the economic importance of grapes, it is conceivable that the crispr/cas <dig> system will soon be adopted for editing grape genomes for various research and applied purposes. to accelerate adoption of this genome-editing technology in grapes, we analyzed grape genome sequences and identified millions of potential protospacers and pams for crispr/cas9-based genome editing. in addition, we developed a user-friendly grape crispr database and made it available for public use.

RESULTS
genomic distribution of protospacers and pams
a total of  <dig> , <dig> protospacer/pams were detected in the draft grape genome, and  <dig>  % of them  were present at specific genomic locations. on average, the number of protospacer/pams in the genome was  <dig> /kb overall with  <dig> /kb site-specific . these protospacers appeared evenly distributed among and within chromosomes. as an illustration , the protospacers on chromosome  <dig> were more or less evenly distributed, although the abundance of the protospacer/pams ranged from  <dig> to 252/kb for the chromosome. the other chromosomes had similar distribution patterns . depending upon the length of a chromosome, the number of protospacers varied among the  <dig> chromosomes . the total protospacers ranged from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in chr <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in chrun, and unique protospacers  ranged from  <dig>   <dig> in chr <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in the chr <dig> . when the numbers of total and unique sites were compared, there were no significant differences in their distribution among the different chromosomes , suggesting that each chromosome had a similar level of protospacer/pam abundance and the overall distribution was relatively uniform. it was noted that the abundance of specific protospacers in both arms of the chromosomes were higher than in the central regions . in addition, there was a significantly positive correlative relationship between the numbers of total and unique protospacers. furthermore, about one third of the unique protospacers  were highly specific.table  <dig> numbers of cleavage sites and their distribution patterns in the grape genome

composition of pams
five pam types were observed, including tgg, agg, ggg, cgg and ngg. the ngg type was observed at a very low frequency  and likely resulted from low-quality sequences. the other four pam types were present on all of the chromosomes. tgg was the most abundant one, followed by agg, ggg and cgg, and they accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the total pams, respectively . as far as pam types are concerned, there was no significant difference between the total and unique pams through the whole grape genome .fig.  <dig> the type and number of pams identified in the grape genome



cleaving sites in different genomic regions
we surveyed the distribution of cleavage sites in various regions of the grape genomes . the number of cleavage sites in the intergenic region was almost 2-fold more than that in the genic region . however, the relative abundance of cleavage sites in genic regions was higher than that in intergenic regions for both overall  and unique  pams. in genic regions, the number of cleavage sites in introns was more than that in exons, which had about the same number of cleavage sites as were found in the utr regions. further, the abundance of cleavage sites in exons and utrs was higher than that in introns. on average, about  <dig>  total cleavage sites and  <dig>  unique ones were present in a gene.

synteny analysis of similar genes and multi-protospacers
most genes had both unique and non-unique protospacers with the exception of  <dig> genes  which contained only non-unique protospacers. these  <dig> genes were scattered in all the chromosomes containing a total of  <dig> protospacers, and had an average of  <dig>  protospacers per gene. synteny analysis of similar genes revealed that the synteny of protospacers matched the synteny of homologous genes. each individual gene might have several protospacers, and some of these protospacers could be found in all of the individual gene members of the same group or family .fig.  <dig> comparative analysis of the relationships of homologous genes and their multi-protospacers in the grape genome. a relationships of  <dig> highly homologous genes. two genes that were linked by a line shared sequence segments with high homology; b synteny analysis of multi-protospacers. the same protospacers were connected by lines



grape-crispr database
to facilitate identification of suitable genomic target sites for editing grape genomes using the crispr/cas <dig> system, we developed a searchable database . the database contains two main sections: search and design. in the search section, users can identify appropriate protospacer and pam sites of a gene by providing certain inquiry information such as locus location, gene id or pfam id. the database will provide an overall score of 1– <dig> for each spacer on the basis of its gc content and pam  type. it will also indicate if a protospacer of interest can be easily incorporated into an expression vector with u <dig> or t <dig> promoter. if a spacer is non-unique, a circus map will be provided to show its relationship with others. the design section is for protospacer design. users can detect and design protospacers and pams in the sequences of interest by using the perl scripts provided.

discussion
protospacers and pams were abundantly present in the grape genomes. these protospacers and pams were more or less uniformly distributed among chromosomes and chromosomal regions. the abundant presence and uniform distribution pattern of these potential target sites provide the possibility for editing most of the grape genomic regions by using the crispr/cas <dig> system. the fact that most genes contain many specific/unique protospacers allows grape researchers to edit a gene of interest with multiple choices of target sites and great specificity. the uniform distribution pattern of protospacers and pams among and within chromosomes suggests that these target sites were apparently not associated with any specific properties of the grape chromosomes. however, the relative abundance of cleavage sites in the genic regions, in coding regions in particular, were higher than that in the intergenic regions.

among the five pam types, tgg and agg types were the most abundant. however, there was no significant statistical difference in their frequencies of occurrence among all the pam types except for the ngg type which was much lower. the type of ngg was a special one which included an ambiguous base pair. these ngg pams were mainly present in regions with a low quality of genomic sequence information, possibly due to the presence of repetitive sequences. in practice, one can use any of the tgg, agg, ggg, and cgg target sites, but not the ngg type, for genome-editing in grapes. our synteny analysis showed that multi-protospacers had synteny with their homologous genes. based on sequence similarity, one could use a universal protospacer to guide the crispr/cas <dig> system simultaneously to edit several genomic sites at one time. this will be especially useful for modifying homologous genes or family genes of interest. because grape is a highly heterozygous species and snps are abundant in the genomes, it would be prudent and useful to re-sequence potential target sites to confirm them and avoid potential mismatches due to the presence of a snp between the reference genome and the grape variety or species of interest.

one of the important outcomes from this study was the development of a grape-crispr database. compared with other similar databases , the grape-crispr database was developed on the basis of a thorough genome-wide analysis of grape genome sequences. we provide annotation, gene id and pfam number information for specific protospacers, which makes the database more informative to users. this database also contains considerably more data than other similar databases and, more importantly, we provide custom perl scripts to scan and filter the database. by doing so, the database will allow users to explore various options and to extract relevant information from it.

CONCLUSIONS
grape genomes contain a large number of pam sites and protospacers for potential genome editing by use of the crispr /cas <dig> system. these sites are widely and more or less evenly distributed among and within chromosomes. the presence of many potential target sites in the grape genomes, and the relatively higher abundance of cleavage sites in the genic regions than in the intergenic regions, provide an encouraging future perspective to edit grape genomes by use of the crispr/cas <dig> system. in addition to charactering various properties of protospacer and pam sites, we developed a grape-crispr database for public use.
