BACKGROUND
the basic helix–loop–helix  proteins are a large superfamily of eukaryotic transcription factors, and play a central role in a wide range of metabolic, physiological, and developmental processes  <cit> . their bhlh domain contains approximately  <dig> amino acids, including a basic region and a hlh region  <cit> . the basic region, which consists of approximately  <dig> amino acids and is located at the n-terminus of the domain, is a dna-binding region that allows hlh proteins to bind to a consensus hexanucleotide e-box   <cit> . the hlh region is composed of two amphipathic helices consisting of hydrophobic residues linked by a divergent  loop, and functions as a dimerization domain  <cit> . the hlh domain promotes protein–protein interactions and allows for the formation of homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes  <cit> . excluding the conserved bhlh domain, the proteins showed considerable sequence divergence  <cit> . furthermore, groups of evolutionary and/or functionally related bhlh proteins shared additional motifs. some of these motifs have been characterized in animals regarding specificity in the dna-binding sequence recognition and dimerization activities responsible for the activation or repression of target genes or for binding to small molecules  <cit> .

previous classifications of animal bhlhs have led to the definition of six major functional and evolutionary lineages   <cit> , which have been further subdivided into several smaller orthologous subfamilies  <cit> . group a of the bhlh proteins can bind to the e-box sequence. in group b, several proteins such as max, myc, mitf, srebp and usf have diverse functions and bind to the g-box sequence cacgtg  <cit> . members of group c contain an additional protein–protein interaction region and bind to sequences  that do not resemble the e-box. proteins in group d contain only the hlh region and can form heterodimers with bhlh proteins and thus are functionally related to typical bhlh proteins  <cit> . group e proteins contain pro or gly residues within the basic region and can bind preferentially to the cacgng sequence  <cit> . group f proteins contain divergent sequences compared with other groups and another domain for dimerization and dna binding  <cit> .

studies on the bhlh gene family in various species will increase our understanding of their evolution and functions. however, systematic identification of the bhlh genes has been performed only in a few plants, such as arabidopsis, rice, poplar, and moss  <cit> . tomato  is one of the most important vegetables in the world and is also a model plant for studying fruit development  <cit> . tomato genome sequencing was recently completed and published  <cit> . but the bhlh gene family of tomato has still not been reported. in this study, we systematically identified and characterized the bhlh genes of tomato  and compared them with the bhlhs of arabidopsis thaliana. in addition, we also analyzed the expression profiles of slbhlh genes in different tissues and at different stages of fruit development as well in response to iron-deficiency stress. finally, we detected several genes associated with fruit development and ripening, and with iron-deficiency responses. in addition, we did the evolutionary analysis of slbhlh genes by comparison of tomato bhlh genes with that of angiosperm, early land plants and algaes.

RESULTS
identification and classification of tomato bhlh genes
for genome-wide identification of bhlh genes in tomato, we initially identified the proteins using two approaches described in the methods and filtered the results based on the criteria developed by atchley et al.  <cit>  and toledo-ortiz et al.  <cit> . the bhlh domain contained  <dig> conserved amino acid residues, including five in the basic region, five in the first helix, one in the loop, and eight in the second helix  <cit>  . based on the criterion for identifying arabidopsis bhlh proteins   <cit> , we allowed nine mismatches from the  <dig> conserved amino acid residues for the identification of tomato bhlhs. to further confirm and filter uncertain bhlh proteins, we performed smart analysis and retained proteins with e-values less than  <dig> . finally, we identified  <dig> genes encoding bhlh proteins  in the tomato genome  and named them according to the system proposed for arabidopsis  <cit>  . compared with the recent report by the tomato genome consortium  <cit> ,  <dig> bhlh proteins were absent in this study because they did not conform to our minimal criteria for inclusion. these proteins contained an incomplete bhlh domain, has a low similarity  with the bhlh domain profile, or more than nine mismatches within the  <dig> conserved amino acid residues.table  <dig>

based on information of gene annotation  <cit> ,  <dig> of the predicted  <dig> slbhlh genes were localized on tomato chromosomes, while slbhlh <dig> was failed to locate on the  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the congregate region and the number of slbhlhs are irregular although the slbhlh genes distributed on all of the  <dig> tomato chromosomes. chromosome  <dig> contained the largest number  of bhlh genes, whereas only four bhlh genes were present on chromosome  <dig>  based on the gene number of each chromosome, the percentage of bhlh genes per chromosome varied from  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with an average ratio of  <dig> % . according to similarity of slbhlh proteins, we speculated that  <dig> genes were generated by gene duplication. of them,  <dig> slbhlhs belonged to the low-stringency duplication, and  <dig> to the high-stringency duplication . based on chromosome localization,  <dig> of  <dig> slbhlhs were tandem array genes  . the segment duplication analysis showed that slbhlh <dig> and solyc01g <dig> were generated via a segment duplication . however, solyc01g <dig> did not contain a complete bhlh domain, suggesting it was a pseudogene. based on our analysis, we propose that the majority of slbhlhs may have been generated via gene duplication rather than segment duplication in the genome of tomato.figure  <dig>

the tomato ‘heinz 1706’ genome, with a genome size of approximately 900 mb, was  <dig>  times larger than the a. thaliana genome. however, the number of slbhlh genes was similar to arabidopsis . based on the total genes, the ratio to slbhlh genes in the tomato genome was about  <dig> %, which was similar to rice  and poplar   <cit> , but was less than arabidopsis   <cit> .

conserved amino acid residues in the bhlh domains and dna-binding ability
the bhlh domain alignment of  <dig> slbhlhs showed that  <dig> amino acid residues in their bhlh domains were conserved with more than 50% consensus ratio . compared with bhlhs of animals that described by atchley et al.  <cit> , we found that the residues ile- <dig>  leu- <dig>  gln- <dig>  lys- <dig>  met- <dig>  ile- <dig>  val- <dig> and leu- <dig> in the bhlh domains of plants were more conserved than in animals, suggesting that the seven amino acid residues may play an important role in plants . further, the residues arg- <dig>  leu- <dig>  and leu- <dig> showed extreme conservation among the  <dig> bhlh proteins of tomato. previous reports revealed that glu- <dig> and arg-16/arg- <dig> in the basic region of bhlh domain play an important role in dna binding  <cit> , and leu- <dig> and leu- <dig> in the helix regions function in dimerization activity  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the basic region of the bhlh proteins contained  <dig> amino acids in tomato, which is four amino acids longer than that described by atchley et al.  <cit>  . the dna-binding activity of target genes is determined in the basic region of the bhlh domain  <cit> . based on the criteria developed by toledo-ortiz et al.  <cit> , we defined proteins with more than five basic amino acid residues in the basic region as dna-binding proteins. furthermore, the dna-binding proteins were subdivided into two subcategories, e-box  and non-e-box binders . glu- <dig> and arg- <dig> are known to be essential for recognition of the e-box, and his/lys- <dig>  glu- <dig>  and arg- <dig> are required for binding of g-box  <cit> . according to the conservation of the residues, we predicted  <dig> slbhlhs as putative e-box-binding proteins, and  <dig> as non-e-box-binding proteins . among the  <dig> e-box-binding proteins,  <dig> belonged to g-box-binding proteins, while  <dig> proteins lacked the g-box-binding site . additionally,  <dig> of  <dig> slbhlhs contain less than six amino acid residues in the basic region, and were classified as non-dna-binding proteins .table  <dig>

intron distribution and phylogenetic analysis of slbhlh genes
to analyze intron distribution within the coding sequence of the bhlh domain in all slbhlh genes, we did alignment analysis with the coding and genome sequences using blat software, and found  <dig> different intron distribution patterns . the intron number ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> within the coding sequence of the bhlh domain . as shown in additional file  <dig>  85% of slbhlhs contained introns in their coding sequence of the bhlh domain, and 74% had a conserved intron position, but the sequence length and similarity of the introns were quite different, even at the same position. in contrast, 15% of the slbhlhs did not contain intron in their bhlh domain region . pattern i  was the most common pattern in arabidopsis  <cit> , but it was only the second common one in tomato. these results showed that intron sequences and distribution between tomato and arabidopsis were different although their bhlh domains were conserved.figure  <dig>

to explore whether the intron distribution pattern and dna-binding activity correlate with their phylogenetic classification, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was built using alignments of bhlh domains. the phylogenetic tree showed that  <dig> bhlh domains were classified into  <dig> subfamilies . the genes with e-box binding region was mostly clustered within the subfamilies 1– <dig>  12– <dig>  and 16– <dig>  whereas the genes with non-dna-binding region were grouped in the subfamilies 6– <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, intron distribution pattern i  and pattern ix  mainly belonged to the e-box-binding type, and pattern xi  to non-dna-binding type. these results suggest that some rules and dependencies exist between the intron distribution pattern and dna-binding activity among the slbhlhs.figure  <dig>

up to now, the biological functions of the most slbhlhs remain unclear. however, approximately 40% of arabidopsis bhlh proteins have been functionally characterized. hence, the clustering and comparison of tomato bhlh proteins with atbhlhs can help to predict their functions via ortholog analysis. the phylogenetic analysis revealed that  <dig> slbhlhs were tightly grouped with the atbhlhs, in which their functions are known. these suggest that the  <dig> slbhlh proteins may have the similar functions as their arabidopsis ortholog .

expression pattern of slbhlh genes among different tissues
to analyze the expression pattern of slbhlh genes among ten different tissues, we used the reads per kilobase per million  normalized data from rna-seq  <cit> . additional file  <dig> showed the expression profiles of slbhlh genes in the ten tomato tissues. among  <dig> slbhlhs genes,  <dig> expressed at least in one of the ten tissues with an rpkm value greater than  <dig> , while the rest  <dig> exhibited a low expression  in all ten tissues. moreover, we found that  <dig> slbhlhs displayed the tissue-specific expression preference . they include eleven genes  in root, three genes  in leaf, three genes  in flower, one gene  in bud, and three genes  in fruit , implying that they may have some functions in these tissues, respectively.

fruit-development-related slbhlh genes and their cis-element analysis
tomato is a model plant for studying fruit development and ripening. based on gene expression data, we identified  <dig> slbhlh genes which showed a gradually increased or decreased expression with fruit development and ripening. of them,  <dig> genes  exhibited a high expression in 1-cm large fruit, and two  in 3-cm large fruit in comparison with other tissues . these data indicate that the eight slbhlh genes may be involved in fruit development. the expression of the rest three genes  was gradually upregulated during the ripening process, suggesting that they may function in fruit ripening. indeed, it was reported recently that slbhlh <dig>  was associated with fruit ripening  <cit> . therefore, further characterization of the  <dig> slbhlhs is highly important and will provide a new insight to understand the molecular mechanism of fruit development and ripening.figure  <dig>

to investigate the regulation mechanisms of the  <dig> fruit-related slbhlh genes, we analyzed their cis-elements from the transcriptional start site to the –1500-bp upstream region . in the  <dig> slbhlhs,  <dig> elements were detected using place , of which  <dig> were mutual elements. ethylene is known to be important for fruit development and ripening  <cit> . thus, we examined ethylene-regulated elements using bioinformatics tool. ethylene-responsive elements  were found in seven genes , which were involved in young fruit development, but were not detected in the three slbhlh genes related to fruits ripening . in previous study, the tgtcaca motif was shown to be an enhancer element required for fruit-specific expression of the cucumisin gene from melon, and the i-box-like sequence agatatgataaaa functions as a negative regulatory element  <cit> . among the fruit-specific bhlh genes of tomato, only slbhlh <dig> contained the tgtcaca element in promoter. although the i-box-like motif was not detected in the promoter region of the  <dig> slbhlhs, the i-box core element  and i-box  presented commonly. considering the distribution of cis-elements in the promoter of these genes, we speculate that they may play some roles in regulating the expression of the corresponding genes for the fruit development and ripening.

prediction of slbhlhs involved in the regulation of iron deficiency responses and homeostasis
iron deficiency is one of mostly limiting factors for plant growth and development. its uptake and homeostasis are tightly regulated because excess and deficiency of iron are pernicious for plants. several bhlh transcription factors involved in the regulation of iron uptake and homeostasis have been cloned and characterized in arabidopsis. they are the fer-like iron-deficiency-induced transcription factor , bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  popeye , and iaa–leu resistant <dig>   <cit> . in tomato, only one bhlh transcriptional regulator , which is involved in regulating iron-deficiency responses and uptake, has been characterized  <cit> . in arabidopsis, fit is an ortholog of tomato fer  <cit> . under iron deficiency, fit interacts with bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig>  bhlh <dig> or bhlh <dig> to form heterodimer and activate the expression of their downstream genes, such as fro <dig> and irt <dig>  <cit> . pye interacts with ilr <dig>  functioning in the negative regulation of iron deficiency responses  <cit> . to predict slbhlhs which may function in the responses to iron deficiency and homeostasis, we compared the tomato bhlhs with atbhlhs. as shown in additional file  <dig>  six slbhlhs  were correspondingly clustered with the  <dig> atbhlhs , which are involved in iron deficiency responses and homeostasis. slbhlh <dig> is fer and the ortholog of fit   <cit> . slbhlh <dig> is corresponded to atbhlh <dig> , slbhlh <dig> to atbhlh <dig> , whereas slbhlh <dig>  slbhlh <dig> and slbhlh <dig> were grouped with atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig> and atbhlh <dig> together. further, we analyzed the expression profiles of the six slbhlhs in shoots and roots using qrt-pcr. the genes slbhlh <dig>  slbhlh <dig> and slbhlh <dig>  which are corresponding to atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig> and atbhlh <dig> of arabidopsis, expressed specifically in roots under iron-deficient conditions , whereas the four arabidopsis genes expressed in roots and also in leaves  <cit> . these results imply that the transcriptional regulation of these bhlh genes has some differences between tomato and arabidopsis. in addition, slbhlh <dig>  and slbhlh <dig>  were also specifically expressed in root, and were highly expressed under iron deficiency. however, the expression of slbhlh <dig>  was not distinct between iron deficiency and sufficiency in shoots while its expression was upregulated only in roots under iron deficiency . all these suggest that slbhlh <dig>  slbhlh <dig> and slbhlh <dig> may have similar function as atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig>  atbhlh <dig> and atbhlh <dig> in the responses to iron deficiency and uptake, and that slbhlh <dig>  like pye of arabidopsis, may function in the negative regulation of iron deficiency responses. however, more experiments are needed to confirm it.figure  <dig>

evolutionary relationship of slbhlh genes
plant kingdom is divided into algae  and land plant   <cit> . its evolution is from algae to land plant. recently, pires and dolan  <cit>  defined the relationships of bhlh proteins in plant kingdom using the whole-genome sequences of nine species from algae and land plants. they showed that only few  bhlh proteins were detected in the genomes of chlorophytes and red algae. in contrast, many bhlh proteins  are identified in the genomes of land plants . phylogenetic analyses suggest that plant bhlh proteins are monophyletic and much of the bhlh protein diversity in plant kingdom was established in early land plants, over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

to observe the evolutionary relationship of tomato bhlh genes, slbhlhs were compared with bhlh protein data of other plants described by pires and dolan  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the bhlh domain regions of bhlh proteins of  <dig> species . as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  total  <dig> bhlh proteins of the  <dig> species were classified into  <dig> subfamilies based on clade and evolution of species in the topology of the trees. the  <dig> bhlhs of tomato were distributed into  <dig> of  <dig> subfamilies except of the subfamily  <dig> and  <dig>  based on the subfamily classification,  <dig> slbhlhs were clustered together with algae bhlhs in the subfamily  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> with moss bhlhs in  <dig> subfamilies , and  <dig> with lycophyte bhlhs in the subfamily  <dig> and  <dig>  these results suggest that the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> slbhlhs may evolve from ancestors of algae, moss and lycophyte, respectively. the oldest evidence for the existence of vascular plants comes from trilete spores found in upper ordovician sediments, over 443 ma  <cit> , and green algae chlorophyceae from  <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . hence, we speculate that 92% of slbhlh proteins should be evolved from ancestor originated in land plants over 443 ma, and 8% from the ancestor appeared in algae over  <dig> billion years ago. these are consistent with the report by pires and dolan  <cit> .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we systematically analyzed the sequence of tomato genome, identified  <dig> bhlh genes, and characterized their structure, duplication, chromosomal distribution, phylogenetic tree, and expression patterns. among the  <dig> slbhlhs, the expression of  <dig> and  <dig> slbhlhs was related to fruit development and ripening, and to response of iron deficiency, respectively. further, we annotated the possible biological functions of  <dig> slbhlhs by comparative analysis with bhlhs of arabidopsis. the evolution analysis showed that all of slbhlhs are highly conserved in plant evolution and much of the diversity of slbhlh proteins was established in early land plants. taken together, the results and information described in this work provide a good basis for further investigation of the biological functions and evolution of tomato bhlh genes.
