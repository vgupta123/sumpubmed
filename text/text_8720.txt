BACKGROUND
site specific proteolysis is a common feature in protein maturation and plays a crucial role in activation of many enzymes and in the generation of peptide hormones. in the late secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells this mechanism is mainly mediated by kexin-like proteinases, a subfamily of the subtilisin-like serine proteinases. multicellular eukaryotes possess a large family of these regulatory proteinases, termed prohormone or proprotein convertases. while in mammals this family consists of at least seven members with tissue-specific expression patterns , fungi harbour only a single gene coding for a subtilisin-like serine proteinase with this activity. originally identified in kex <dig> mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the ability to process the virally encoded killer toxin   <cit>  the fungal kex <dig> protein has since been implicated in several other proteolytic activation events, e.g. pheromone maturation at lysine-arginine motifs  <cit> . the s. cerevisiae kex <dig> protein has been the target of substantial biochemical  <cit>  and crystallographic  research. apart from s. cerevisiae, a diverse spectrum of phenotypic descriptions has been published for a range of kex <dig> deletion mutants from other yeasts, such as candida albicans  <cit> , c. glabrata  <cit> , pichia pastoris  <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , or yarrowia lipolytica  <cit>  and moulds such as aspergillus niger  <cit> , a. oryzae  <cit>  or trichoderma reesei  <cit> . the phenotypes of these deletion mutants include morphological changes that are thought to result from the lack of activity from cell-wall modifying enzymes, reduced virulence in the case of c. albicans  <cit> , hypersensitivity to antimycotic drugs that target cell wall or plasma membrane integrity in c. glabrata  <cit>  and inviability in s. pombe  <cit> . in theory, the phenotypes of kex <dig> deletion mutants can be explained by the lack of processing events in substrate proteins rendering these dysfunctional, as in the case of the α-pheromone, where the lack of processing renders the kex <dig> mutant of s. cerevisiae mating deficient  <cit> . because of the localization of the kex <dig> protein in the late trans golgi network  <cit>  and an endocytic, prevacuolar compartment  <cit> , it can be concluded that the target spectrum is limited to proteins attached to the cell surface, those proteins which are secreted into the environment or to the luminal domains of integral membrane proteins passing through these compartments. accordingly, the phenotypes of kex <dig> mutants include the secretion of unprocessed protein precursors into the environment, e.g. the secretory xylanase of t. reesei  <cit> . however, these effects are blurred as the phenotypes observed from kex <dig> mutants may only be secondary effects themselves. furthermore, missing kex2-processing events may well be covered up by processing through other proteinases, such as the yapsins, a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchored aspartic proteinases  <cit> . in the case of proteinase pro-peptides these events may also occur autocatalytically, as proposed for casap <dig>  <cit> . while there is a fair number of proteins that have been annotated as potential kex <dig> targets and two earlier studies have predicted kex <dig> targets  <cit> , the number of proteins for which experimental proof of cleavage by kex <dig> exists, remains low.

knowing the substrates of this proteinase would not only help to explain the phenotypes observed in fungal kex <dig> deletion mutants, but also provide insights into essential cellular regulatory mechanisms. we have aimed at providing an improved assembly of kex <dig> target proteins and present first biochemical evidence for the processing of selected substrates, in particular from the human pathogenic yeasts c. albicans and c. glabrata. furthermore, we provide evidence for extended subsite recognition in the p1'–p4' region. by using recombinant kex <dig> proteinases and potential substrate proteins from pathogenic and non-pathogenic yeasts, we show that the substrate specificity is generally conserved between organisms. however, our data also suggest that some kex <dig> proteinases have additional unique substrates.

RESULTS
heterologous expression and purification of kex <dig> proteinases
in its native form kex <dig> is a type i membrane protein with the catalytic domain located inside the trans golgi network lumen . as neither the transmembrane domain nor the cytosolic domain are necessary for the catalytic activity, it is possible to produce a soluble and secreted version of this enzyme by truncation of the gene just before the sequences encoding the transmembrane domain  <cit> .

for the expression of the soluble forms of s. cerevisiae, c. glabrata and p. pastoris kex <dig> enzymes the p. pastoris expression system  was used. the strain expressing s. cerevisiae kex <dig> was a kind gift of guy boileau  <cit> . for the expression of c. glabrata and p. pastoris kex <dig> enzymes the 5' part of the gene coding for the luminal domain of the enzyme, including the native signal- and pro-peptide, plus a c-terminal  <dig> × his-tag were cloned into the pic <dig>  vector  and transformed into p. pastoris strain gs <dig>  the transformants displaying the strongest extracellular proteolytic activity  in test expressions were used for large-scale production of the enzymes.

attempts to purify the c. glabrata and p. pastoris kex <dig> enzymes via  <dig> × his-affinity chromatography were not successful, possibly due to burial of the epitope inside the protein. thus, all three enzymes, including the one from s. cerevisiae, were purified to near homogeneity by a combination of anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography .

because several attempts to produce the intact, soluble form of kex <dig> of c. albicans in the pichia system failed, ultimately the native host c. albicans was used for production of this enzyme: the 5' part of the c. albicans kex <dig> gene coding for the luminal domain of the enzyme, again including the native signal- and pro-peptide as well as a c-terminal  <dig> × his tag was put under the control of the constitutive and strong promoter of the act <dig> gene, as described under methods . the linearized plasmid was transformed into c. albicans strain cai <dig> and the transformant giving the strongest kex2-like activity in the supernatant  was used for further large scale production of the enzyme, as above.

while we were able to produce the high kex <dig> activity in supernatants, the efficiency of its purification remained low. highest yields of enzyme were achieved using complex media including yeast extract and peptone, but this resulted in only impure enzyme preparations. however, the parental strain did not produce this activity . to avoid low-weight impurities in the enzyme preparations, which would have disguised product bands in further analytical experiments, the medium was passed over a  <dig> kda size-exclusion column prior to the expression. in combination with the purification methods as outlined above this resulted in an enzyme preparation that contained only few other proteins and was devoid of low molecular weight contaminants.

activity testing of the enzyme preparations
prior to use, enzyme preparations were adjusted to a common activity of one nmol/min per μl proteinase added in a standard reaction setup with the chromogenic substrate z-tyr-lys-arg-pna. neither preparations from a p. pastoris negative control strain nor from the c. albicans parental cai <dig> strain displayed this activity . in addition we performed controls with the c. albicans enzyme preparation to ascertain that the proteolytic activity was kex2-dependent: the activity was indeed inhibited by pmsf, edta and zncl <dig>  but not by pepstatin a .

to test whether the enzymes had similar properties we first tested the enzymes for optimal ph and temperature with the chromogenic substrate z-tyr-lys-arg-pna. the optimal ph for all enzymes was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  , as described earlier for the s. cerevisiae enzyme  <cit>  and this ph was therefore used throughout all further experiments. in contrast, the result for the optimal temperature was surprising: all enzymes showed an elevated activity at unphysiological temperatures from 40°c to 50°c , at which none of the source organisms display optimal growth, if any. nevertheless, all following experiments were carried out at 37°c, reflecting human body temperature, as our main focus lay on the enzymes of the human pathogenic fungi c. albicans and c. glabrata.

since the kex <dig> gene of c. albicans can complement the kex <dig> deletion in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and the kex <dig> gene from s. cerevisiae can complement the loss of the kex2-ortholog krp <dig> in schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> , it is feasible to assume that these enzymes have similar to identical biological functions and biochemical properties. to show that this is also the case for the kex <dig> proteinases from c. glabrata and p. pastoris, we tested whether all four proteinases cleaved the s. cerevisiae α-mating pheromone, a natural and proven substrate of kex <dig> from s. cerevisiae, in a similar manner : the α-mating pheromone precursor protein was purified using the pet100-d e. coli expression system as described below for the other substrate proteins. indeed, the four proteinases showed the same digestion pattern of the pheromone precursor into the expected fragments of the n-terminal  <dig> kda peptide and peptides of 2– <dig> kda size .

prediction of potential kex <dig> substrates
next, we developed a prediction method for potential kex <dig> cleavage sites in substrate proteins to identify proteins from c. albicans, c. glabrata or s. cerevisiae for testing with the proteinases. earlier studies  <cit>  used very stringent search parameters and only looked in the n-terminal region of protein sequences. however, there is biochemical and biological evidence for processing of sites containing other amino acids in the p <dig> position  <cit>  as well as activity on c-terminal motifs in other organisms such as the chloroperoxidase cpo of a. niger  <cit>  and on membrane proteins such as kex <dig> itself. therefore we included golgi-luminal portions of transmembrane proteins as well as full-length sequences of soluble proteins into our search. er-retained proteins were excluded, as they should not come into contact with kex <dig> 

the predicted set of proteins was screened for potential cleavage sites using a position specific scoring matrix  . this also allowed for a ranking of the sites found. the matrix used for the prediction of kex <dig> substrate proteins was derived from systematic biochemical and genetic data generated with the s. cerevisiae enzyme  <cit> . all proteins with potential kex <dig> cleavage sites were aligned with orthologous proteins of other fungi. this allowed for investigation of conservation of the potential cleavage site between different proteins with similar biochemical properties. this search yielded a total of  <dig> cleavage sites in  <dig> individual proteins  which presumably pass the golgi compartment. selected substrate groups with conserved sites are shown in additional file  <dig> 

the matrix represents the affinity of kex <dig> towards the respective amino acid residues of positions p4-p <dig> relative to the cleavage site. scores were calculated from biochemical and mating efficiency data given in the literature, as outlined in the text.

expression of substrate proteins
from the  <dig> predicted potential kex <dig> substrate proteins we selected a total of  <dig> proteins  for heterologous expression in e. coli . these were chosen to cover a wide range of different cleavage sites and protein types and expressed using the topo-pet d <dig> system. the dna fragments cloned were devoid of domains encoding signal peptides and putative gpi-anchor sequences. out of these selected proteins, we were able to express and purify thirteen from c. albicans, ten from c. glabrata and one from s. cerevisiae . since the majority of the chosen proteins accumulated as inclusion bodies, we converted these proteins into a soluble form by on-column refolding. to test for overall correct folding of the refolded proteins, we performed an activity test for the substrate ca <dig>  an acid phosphatase, which was the only protein with a known activity in this set. indeed, we were able to confirm the activity of this protein and observe a maximum activity at ph  <dig> – <dig>   using para-nitrophenol phosphate as a substrate. this shows that at least some refolded protein assumes its native structure and can thus be used for specific proteolysis assays.

in vitro proteolytic processing of substrate proteins by kex <dig> from c. albicans, c. glabrata, s. cerevisiae and p. pastoris
very few studies provided experimental evidence that predicted kex <dig> cleavage sites in potential substrate proteins are in fact processed by kex <dig> proteinases. in order to determine susceptibility of the purified proteins to proteolytic processing by kex <dig>  all potential substrate proteins purified above were digested with each of the four proteinases. a selection of digestions is depicted in figure  <dig>  based on the scores given by the algorithm, we expected most proteins to be cleaved. indeed, we observed rapid cleavage at the predicted cleavage sites for 2/ <dig> of the proteins. this also included cleavage at sites with lower scores in polypeptide precursors . in contrast, some proteins were not cleaved even though they contained sites with high scores, such as caccw <dig> . furthermore, one protein  was cleaved very differently by the proteinases: while it was not cleaved at all by sckex <dig>  cakex <dig> rapidly processed the precursor into peptide sized fragments, without any noteworthy appearance of intermediates under the standard reaction conditions . a similar activity was observed with cgkex <dig> and ppkex <dig>  while at a considerably slower rate of hydrolysis.

proteins that were cleaved into fragments of the expected sizes were ca <dig>  caece <dig> , ca <dig>  ca <dig>  capga <dig>  catos <dig> , casun <dig> , cgscw <dig> , cgsun <dig> , cgpir <dig> , cgpry <dig>  and cgpry <dig> . proteins that remained fully uncleaved were caccw <dig> , capho <dig> , carbt <dig> , cacrh <dig> , the plb-homolog cagl0j11770g and the three proteins of unknown function ca <dig>  cagl0h08910g and cagl0a02277g.

the pattern of cleavage vs. non-cleavage observed was not sufficiently explained by the score calculated from the prediction algorithm among the proteins tested. therefore, we inspected the amino acid distribution surrounding the investigated and other known cleavage sites for other patterns: indeed, a high overrepresentation of negatively charged  and small  residues in the p1', p2' positions and a similar moderate overrepresentation in the p4' position was found, while positively charged residues were underrepresented at those substrate sites which were digested. in the case for the sites not cleaved, no over- or under-representation was observed .

reflection of substrate recognition in proteinase structure
next, we asked whether the apparent preference for negatively charged residues in the p1'–p4' region of substrates digested by kex <dig> proteins is reflected by the structure of the proteinases in the substrate binding cleft.

recently, a 3d model of the bacterial subtilisin kumamolisin of bacillus novospec was published  <cit> . the enzyme studied there was incapable of autoproteolytic activation thus retaining the pro-peptide. by superimposition with the coordinate sets of s. cerevisiae kex <dig>  <cit>  and mus musculus furin  <cit>  we were able to investigate the potential substrate binding pockets in the p1' – p4' region  as outlined by the intact pro-peptide cleavage site still bound into the substrate binding cleft. indeed, the p4-p <dig> positions of the kumamolisin pro-domain aligned with the known s4-s <dig> pockets of the enzymes , as well as the p1'–p3' positions with the s1'–s3' pockets predicted in the literature  <cit>  .

the neighbouring s1' and s3' pockets are characterized by positive charges in sckex <dig>  as well as in furin , and both pockets may well accommodate aspartate or glutamate residues in the substrate. in furin, the excess charge possibly results in a stronger selection for negatively charged residues in the p1' position, but as the s <dig> pocket is directly adjacent to the s1' pocket, the lack of a positively charged p <dig> residue in furin substrates may compensate this effect. the s2' pocket, located on the opposite side of the cleft, as well contains a terminal positive charge  which would favour negatively charged residues in the p2' position.

a potential p4' pocket was also identified . the p4' residue aligns between s <dig> and q <dig> and extends towards e <dig> in the furin model . the alignment with sckex <dig> is of lesser quality in this region, but nevertheless a similarly built potential binding pocket is seen in the sckex <dig> enzyme bordered by s <dig> and y <dig> . however, the equivalent to the negative terminal charge of e <dig> in furin would be the positive charge of h <dig> in sckex <dig> 

in summary, the structure of the enzymes explains the increased preference for negatively charged p1'–p4' residues in the substrates.

conservation of residues involved in substrate recognition
it is known from previous studies, that c. albicans kex <dig> can complement kex <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and this gene in turn can complement the kex <dig> ortholog krp <dig> in s. pombe  <cit> . therefore, it must be concluded that the corresponding proteinases have similar substrate specificities and activities. nevertheless, we have been able to show that at least in the case of one substrate  the proteinases of s. cerevisiae and c. albicans behave differently. to investigate whether this difference as well as the question whether or not the substrate specificity in general is the same in different fungi, we generated a sequence alignment of kex2-orthologous proteins from fungi and furin-orthologous proteins from mammals  and investigated the residues involved in substrate recognition  for their degree of conservation between the different species.

residues relevant for substrate recognition given in the literature or identified in this study were compiled. column a: residues were numbered "a" trough "e". the identical numbering was also used in figure  <dig> and figure 7; columns  <dig> and 3: the respective analogous residues in sckex <dig>  and mmfurin  are given along with the reference.

the s <dig> pocket  is fully conserved and among fungi this is also true for the four negative charges of the s <dig> pocket . interestingly, we observed for the s <dig> and the s1' position that the enzymes from ascomycetales combine the charge-selective properties of the s. cerevisiae kex <dig> enzyme with those from the furin enzymes, and thus probably display the most discrete substrate recognition. among the saccharomycetales the residues are conserved for the major subsites s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s1' with minor exceptions only. differences are visible in subsites where there is no strong selection to or discrimination against substrate residues, such as the s <dig> pocket . the s2' pocket is generally positively charged, however, this charge is mediated by one histidine in either the v or the w position.

in summary, it is seen, that the substrate selectivity among saccharomycetales kex <dig> enzymes is very conserved, and that there are no substitutions that would explain the differential processing of substrate ca <dig> between the four proteinases. therefore, the enzymes must discriminate their substrates either through further subsites or through processes independent of the primary sequence surrounding the cleavage site.

relevance of substrate structural features for cleavage
during the in vitro cleavage experiments, we observed that proteins purified from the soluble fraction of e. coli lysates were generally processed more efficiently than those purified and refolded from inclusion bodies. therefore, we predicted that the three dimensional structure of the substrate and the exposure of the putative processing site on the protein surface is crucial for processing to occur. to investigate this further, we tested if sites that were readily cleaved in the native protein were still cleaved in a denatured form of the protein: two substrate proteins that were readily cleaved by sckex <dig>  were heat denatured prior to addition of the sckex <dig> proteinase . as expected, both were cleaved less in the denatured form. this effect is more pronounced for ca <dig> than for caece <dig>  as caece <dig> contains seven equal cleavage sites and is thus generally more prone to processing than ca <dig>  the reduced cleavage of partially denatured/refolded proteins can be explained by either inaccessibility of the site due to burial in the denatured structure or by the failure to form a specific secondary structure needed for processing.

also, we did not observe cleavage for all proteins with potentially good sites. therefore, we tested if this was due to an uncleavable primary sequence or if there were structural constraints preventing cleavage: site  <dig> of caccw <dig> and site  <dig> of ca <dig>  were each fused between a gst and a gfp domain and so exposed to the solvent. the gst-ca <dig>  <cit> -gfp fusion protein was not cleaved , indicating that this sequence is not a substrate of sckex <dig> and the non-cleavage of the full length protein is not due to structural constraints, as was expected due to the cleavage by the other three kex <dig> enzymes. in contrast, the gst-caccw <dig>  <cit> -gfp fusion protein was readily cleaved by sckex <dig> , demonstrating that this primary sequence reflects a good substrate and the non-cleavage in the full length protein must be due to structural constraints. this gives further evidence that accessibility and/or secondary structure of the cleavage site are essential for processing.

discussion
the pleiotropic phenotype of fungal kex <dig> deletion mutants is attributed to the lack of posttranslational, proteolytic activation of substrate proteins. besides biochemical data describing the p4-p <dig> substrate recognition towards short peptides of the saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme, only very few data exist of substrate preferences of fungal kex <dig> proteins. several proteins have been discussed as "potential kex <dig> substrates", however there is no experimental data confirming actual cleavage by kex <dig>  except for a few cases, e.g. killer toxin, α-mating pheromones and proteinase propeptides. in the present study, we have investigated cleavage of recombinant kex <dig> proteinases on recombinant, potential kex <dig> substrates in order to get a first insight into the possible substrate repertoire of these regulatory proteases.

for heterologous production of soluble kex <dig> enzymes, we selected the proteins from the two pathogenic fungi c. albicans and c. glabrata, as the phenotypes of the respective deletion mutants include avirulence  <cit>  and increased susceptibility to antifungal compounds  <cit> . in addition, we selected the well characterized s. cerevisiae enzyme and the ortholog from pichia pastoris, as this enzyme is often involved in the heterologous production of secretory proteins. the golgi-luminal domains of these four enzymes were expressed in the host p. pastoris and purified from culture supernatant, except for kex <dig> from c. albicans, which was produced in c. albicans itself, as it was not expressible in pichia. the purified enzymes showed similar ph- and temperature dependencies: the optimal ph was found at ph  <dig> , as reported for s. cerevisiae kex <dig>  <cit> , but surprisingly maximum cleavage of the artificial substrate z-tkr-pna was observed at unphysiological temperatures ranging from 40°c to 55°c. the fact that the enzymes retain their catalytic activities at theses temperatures could reflect a stabilizing effect on the protein structure proposed for the p-domain of kex <dig>  <cit> .

to identify new substrates of kex <dig>  we have searched the genomes of c. albicans, c. glabrata and s. cerevisiae, for secretory proteins containing potential cleavage sites. these were grouped into clusters by sequence similarity and based on the conservation of such sites selected for heterologous expression and in vitro cleavage testing by kex <dig> enzymes .

all four proteinases cleaved the s. cerevisiae α-mating pheromone precursor in the same expected pattern, confirming the orthologous enzymatic activities of the proteins. as it is known, that the c. albicans and s. pombe kex <dig> proteins can complement the s. cerevisiae kex <dig> protein in vivo , it was not surprising that almost all substrates were cleaved  in an identical manner. however, one substrate  was differentially processed. this demonstrates that even though the proteins have very high sequence similarity they still have partially different substrate preferences.

statistical sequence analysis of processed vs. non-processed sites reveals an overrepresentation of negatively charged  or small residues in the p1', p2' and p4' positions, which has also been reported for substrates of the mammalian furin/pc proteinase family  <cit>  . this finding is strengthened by the fact that a mutant of scpir <dig>  where the kex <dig> cleavage site was changed from kr/d to kr/a failed to undergo processing  <cit> . previous biochemical analyses of substrate preference have focussed on the s1–s <dig> regions of the enzymes  <cit> , due to the nature of the substrates used in those studies. however, the solved three dimensional structures of s. cerevisiae and mus musculus furin in complex with proteinaceous inhibitors such as eglin-c have lead to the postulation of binding pockets also in the s1' and s2' regions  <cit> . in order to identify further residues involved in substrate recognition in the s1'–s4' region, we have produced a structural alignment of s. cerevisiae kex <dig>  m. musculus furin and the bacterial subtilisin-like proteinase kumamolisin of bacillus novospec mn- <dig>  <cit> . the latter structure was solved for an active-site mutated form of the protein, which still retained its propeptide. due to the autocatalytic nature of the maturation process of subtilisin-like proteinases  <cit> , the propeptide is the first substrate cleaved by the enzyme and should reflect an optimal substrate. indeed, the p1' residue of the kumamolisin propeptide aligned with the predicted s1' binding pocket of the kexins . in addition, we identified a potential s <dig> binding pocket, which in kex <dig> terminates with the positively charged h <dig> .

a sequence alignment of residues involved in substrate recognition shows that these residues are generally very highly conserved among the enzymes investigated here . accordingly, there is no single residue that could explain the strong difference between sckex <dig> and cakex <dig> in cleavage of substrate ca <dig>  however, it is possible that a combination of such amino acid exchanges could generate such an effect. in accordance with the experimental data, it is likely that the kex2-ortholog enzymes of the saccharomycetales exhibit a similar activity and the cleaved substrate pattern is comparable within these. however, for the enzymes from ascomycetales it would be expected that they are more stringently selective for charged residues in the p <dig> and p1' position.

in addition to the very important direct enzyme-substrate interactions outlined here, other parameters must influence substrate recognition by kex <dig> proteinases: the reduced cleavage of heat denatured protein shows that a site must be properly folded to be accessible. this view is strongly supported by the fact, that a potentially preferred substrate  remains uncleaved in its native context but becomes cleavable, when exposed to the proteinase in a fusion protein . in our experiments 1/ <dig> of the selected proteins remained uncleaved. hence, to properly identify proteinase substrates, it is essential to include further parameters such as substrate structure in addition to primary sequence into the prediction algorithm.

our data provide information beyond those previous data based on in silico predictions or assays with small peptides only. by using heterologous expressed proteases and substrates we were able to show the potential of each of the investigated kex <dig> enzymes to digest selected putative substrates. however, further in vivo experiments are necessary in future studies to undoubtedly infer proteolytic maturation of these substrates.

aside from α-mating pheromone- and killer toxin precursors, the only previously experimentally proven kex <dig> substrates are the glycolytic enzymes exg <dig> of s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and xylanases of t. reesei  <cit> , the aspartic proteinase casap <dig>  <cit> , the structural cell wall pir protein family  <cit>  and the hydrophobin rep <dig> of ustilago maydis  <cit> . in our experiments we were able to confirm processing by kex <dig> for the cell wall modulating enzymes casun <dig> , cgscw <dig>  and cgsun <dig>  and for cgpir <dig>  which had been predicted to be kex <dig> substrates in earlier in silico searches  <cit> . additionally, we observed in vitro cleavage for several proteins which have not previously been discussed as kex <dig> substrates such as caece <dig>  a group of ops4-like proteins and two members of the pry-protein family.

in our tests three proteins of the "plant pathogenicity related" pry-protein family  were included. the proteins of this family contain a strongly conserved kr-motif , but the proteins are not cleaved in a similar pattern: while cgpry <dig> is cleaved efficiently, carbt <dig> is not cleaved at all and cgpry <dig> only very slowly. it is therefore likely, that the conserved site of the pry proteins is not cleaved in the fully native protein, and that processing of cgpry <dig> only takes place in the additional sites not present in the other two proteins.

the major phenotype described for kex <dig> deletion mutants in candida revolves around morphological defects of the cell wall  <cit>  and the resulting hypersensitivity to compounds interfering with the surface integrity  <cit> . several kex <dig> target proteins directly interact with the fungal cell wall or are structural components thereof: the pir proteins, glucanases such as exg <dig>  or proteins of the sun/scw family. while the direct consequence of failure to mature is not known for these proteins, the phenotypes of the respective deletion strains resemble those of kex <dig> deletion strains: mutants lacking cell wall localized glucanases such as scexg <dig>  <cit>  or cabgl <dig>  <cit>  and mutants lacking members of the pir  <cit>  or the sun-family  <cit>  show similar increased sensitivities towards several cell wall or membrane perturbing compounds  <cit> . here it is interesting, that the kex <dig> cleavage site is found in several but not in all glucanases.

additionally, pir deletions result in the formation of cell aggregates  <cit> , which is also be seen in the s. cerevisiae sun <dig> and c. albicans sun <dig> deletion strains  <cit>  and are also observed in c. glabrata kex <dig> deletion strains . furthermore, a s. cerevisiae scw4/scw <dig> double mutant  <cit>  and a c. albicans sun <dig> strain showed enlarged cells  <cit> , a phenotype which can also be observed in the c. glabrata kex <dig> mutant . furthermore, calcofluor white stained c. albicans kex <dig> cells show an abberant staining pattern  <cit> , which would be in agreement with the potential changes in chitin deposition as seen from the abberant septum processing in c. albicans sun <dig> strains  <cit> . the kex <dig> cleavage site in sun4- and scw10-like proteins is preceded by an n-terminal stretch of positively charged amino acids, mainly histidines . this feature, which we termed "his-box", is also found in tos <dig> proteins, only here it is located further inside the protein and is additionally preceded by another kex <dig> cleavage site. it can be speculated that, if this motif was involved in cell wall attachment, processing would lead to differential localization of the mature protein, e.g. secretion as observed in c. albicans for sun <dig> and tos <dig>  <cit> .

besides explaining previously observed phenotypes, the identification of cleavage sites may yield additional functional information about a protein: the expression of caece <dig> is tightly associated with hyphae in c. albicans, but the deletion has no apparent effect on morphology and no function could be assigned to this protein  <cit> . while there is no sequence homology, the polypeptide precursor structure of caece <dig>  and also that of ca <dig>  resemble that of the repellent protein rep <dig> of ustilago maydis  <cit> . the umrep <dig> protein contains ten strongly conserved repeats separated by kex <dig> cleavage sites and a longer terminal fragment with no similarity to the repeats . ca <dig> is shorter, with only three conserved repeats each containing another internal kex <dig> cleavage site, but no terminal fragment. in caece <dig>  the seven repeats are less conserved, but the longer, terminal fragment is present. umrep <dig> functions as a structural component of aerial hyphae and caece <dig> or ca <dig> might play similar roles on the hyphae of c. albicans. all three proteins seem to have in common that a processing via kex <dig> proteinases may be necessary for their proper biological function.

a second group of proteins without assigned function identified as kex <dig> substrates is the family of c. albicans ops4-like proteins, whose members are differentially regulated in white-opaque switching  <cit>  and mating  <cit> . this family consists of caops <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig> and capga <dig> . the c. albicans and s. cerevisiae kex <dig> deletion mutants are mating deficient  <cit> . this has been attributed to the lack of processed α-mating pheromone, but if the above proteins are indeed involved in the mating process, the kex <dig> mating deficiency could be more severe than thought.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data show that fungal kex <dig> proteinases are similar in their substrate activities but these substrates may have different functions according to the different biological backgrounds of the investigated fungi, including pathogenicity in humans. in addition, the preferred processing sites of these substrates do not only depend on the amino acids surrounding the processing site, but also on other features such as three dimensional structure. furthermore, kex <dig> proteinases may have unique substrates whose processing sites are adapted to individual proteinases in each organism.
