BACKGROUND
the peripheral circulatory system is segmentally organized into sparse arteries and arterioles that feed a dense capillary network drained by postcapillary venules  that merge into collecting venules  and veins. in most tissues, each vascular segment is dedicated to a specific task – arteries and arterioles regulate blood flow, gas and nutrient exchange occurs in capillaries, and leukocyte adhesion and emigration is restricted to pcvs and cvs  <cit> .

although the expression of some gene products by endothelial cells  is regulated by hydrodynamic shear stress  <cit> , there is evidence that the specialized function of venules in leukocyte adhesion is due to segmentally distinct endothelial programming, rather than hemodynamic differences  <cit> . indeed, the specification of microvascular segments during embryogenesis is established before the initiation of blood flow  <cit> . studies employing intravital microscopy  have demonstrated that the initial attachment and arrest of free flowing leukocytes to the microvascular wall in most tissues  is a feature of pcvs and cvs, whereas capillaries and arterioles usually do not support leukocyte trafficking  <cit> . this specialization of venular endothelium is found in vertebrates ranging from agnathans to mammals  <cit>  and in both adults and fetuses  <cit> .

leukocyte recruitment from blood to tissues follows a well-established paradigm, the multi-step adhesion cascade, which distinguishes at least three consecutive dynamic interactions, namely leukocyte tethering and rolling, chemoattractant-induced activation, and integrin-mediated firm arrest  <cit> . adherent cells then undergo intraluminal crawling followed by transmigration across the endothelial barrier  <cit> . these in vivo observations are consistent with reports on preferential venular expression of various adhesion molecules, the molecular nature and composition of which vary among different microvascular beds  <cit> . however, the underlying differentiation program that enables venular endothelial cells  to express leukocyte traffic molecules, but prohibits non-venular endothelial cells  in capillaries and arterioles from doing so is unknown.

a handful of markers have been suggested to distinguish v-ecs from nv-ecs. one candidate is the atypical chemokine receptor darc , which binds several pro-inflammatory cc and cxc chemokines  <cit> . darc regulates the activity of these chemokines by transcytosing them across the endothelial barrier  <cit> . darc has been shown to delineate v-ecs in human kidney  <cit>  and spleen  <cit>  and high endothelial venules  in murine lymph nodes   <cit> . recently, endothelial darc expression was reported in experimental atherosclerosis and encephalitis on sections of the aorta  <cit>  and in brain microvasculature  <cit> , respectively.

aside from ecs, darc is also expressed in the erythroid lineage. indeed, darc was first described as a blood group antigen  <cit>  and its role on red blood cells  has been studied extensively  <cit> . erythroid darc modulates the bioavailability of serum chemokines and serves as an entry receptor for p. vivax and p. knowlesi, enabling infection of rbcs by these pathogens  <cit> . immunostaining of human tissues has identified darc on a few non-vascular cell types, such as purkinje cells  <cit>  and renal epithelial cells  <cit> . more recently, using a commercial polyclonal ab against murine darc, darc expression was reported on bone marrow  macrophages  <cit> . the same study reported that darc was essentially undetectable on microvascular endothelium from a variety of mouse tissues, which appeared to be in contrast to previous observations in humans. thus, it is currently unclear whether and to what extent darc can serve as a reliable marker of v-ecs in mice. indeed, presumably due to a lack of suitable reagents, a systematic analysis of microvascular darc expression in murine tissues has not been performed so far.

here, using a newly generated monoclonal ab  against mouse darc, we have explored darc as an endothelial surface marker in a variety of murine tissues and assessed the utility of this research tool for flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, ivm, and western blot analysis. we show that anti-darc mab can be used to identify and isolate ecs from pcvs and cvs in vitro and in vivo and that darc expression is uniformly expressed and highly restricted to venules in multiple organs. using flow cytometry, we determined that the relative abundance of v-ecs varies considerably between different tissues, possibly reflecting organ-specific differences in immune surveillance by migratory leukocytes.

RESULTS
validation of anti-mouse darc mab specificity
after immunization of a rat with darc-egfp transfected pc- <dig> cells, hybridoma lines were generated and supernatants screened by facs. one hybridoma supernatant stained hek- <dig> cells transfected with darc or darc-egfp , as well as rbcs from c57bl/ <dig> wt mice , but not untransfected hek- <dig> cells or darc–/– rbcs. this hybridoma was subcloned and determined to produce a single mab of igg2a,k isotype. both supernatant and purified igg recognized darc protein in lysates of darc or darc-egfp transfected hek- <dig> cells by western blot . no signal was detected with the parental untransfected hek- <dig> line. robust immunoreactivity was also observed with ter-119+ rbcs from balb/c mice. the mab did not cross-react with rbcs from other species, including rat and human . confocal microscopy of peripheral lymph node  sections revealed that anti-darc mab colocalized with mab meca- <dig>  which specifically delineates peripheral node addressin , a marker of hevs  <cit> . no microvascular reactivity was detected in darc–/– plns .fig.  <dig> validation of anti-mouse darc mab reactivity. a representative flow cytometry histograms of control hek- <dig> cells  and hek- <dig> cells transfected with darc or darc-egfp fusion protein stained with anti-mouse darc mab . b flow cytometry analysis of anti-mouse darc mab reactivity with rbcs. peripheral blood was harvested from wildtype  and darc–/– mice and stained with a mab against the rbc marker ter- <dig> and anti-mouse darc mab  or isotype control mab  . c western blot analysis of anti-mouse darc mab reactivity with protein lysates from untransfected hek- <dig> cells and hek- <dig> cells stably transfected with darc or darc-egfp fusion protein. b-actin is shown as loading control . d representative confocal fluorescent micrographs of frozen sections of peripheral lymph nodes from darc wt and darc–/– mice stained with mabs against cd <dig> , peripheral node addressin , and darc or isotype control . 20× objective, scale bars = 200 μm 




to assess whether the anti-darc mab is sensitive to darc occupancy with chemokines, we assessed staining of wt rbcs in the presence of cxcl <dig> or cxcl <dig>  neither chemokine affected binding of the anti-mouse mab, whereas both blocked staining of human rbcs with anti-human darc mab fy <dig> , consistent with previous studies  <cit> . thus, although the exact epitope recognized by our anti-mouse darc mab was not identified, it is unlikely to overlap with the chemokine binding region of darc.

darc expression is restricted to v-ecs
confocal micrographs of whole mounts of murine adipose tissue and skin showed that darc immunoreactivity was exclusively biased toward venules . no signal was detected in either arterioles or the vast majority of capillaries. on v-ecs, darc appeared to be enriched at intercellular junctions between adjacent ecs.fig.  <dig> darc is a robust marker of venular endothelial cell differentiation. a representative confocal micrographs of whole mount stainings of adipose tissue  and skin  with mabs against cd <dig> , darc , and lyve- <dig> . arrows in images on the left identify representative arterioles , capillaries , and venules . the boxed area in the merged image of adipose tissue was magnified  to illustrate concentrated darc staining at inter-endothelial junctions . adipose tissue n >  <dig> experiments, skin n >  <dig> experiments. b semi-quantitative analysis of darc expression in arterioles , capillaries , pre-venular capillaries , post-capillary venules , and collecting venules  in adipose tissue. data represent  <dig> microvascular trees from seven fields of view of omenta from two mice. supporting data values are included in additional file  <dig>  representative confocal micrographs of tissues stained with anti-cd <dig>  and anti-darc  depict positive, partial, and negative darc staining on pvcs and partial darc expression on pcvs. error bars depict mean ± sem




to quantify the frequency of darc+ and darc– microvessels, we categorized cd31+ microvascular segments based on their morphology and caliber in whole mounts of omentum. virtually all pcvs and cvs were darc+, whereas arterioles and downstream capillaries were consistently darc–. the transition from darc– to darc+ ecs occurred either at the point where capillaries merged to form a pcv or slightly upstream in pre-venular capillaries . darc staining in venules was generally uniform and without obvious gaps in immunoreactivity, suggesting that essentially all v-ecs express darc. analogous distribution patterns were detected in multiple tissues, including cremaster muscle, bladder, conjunctiva, brain, peyer’s patches, mesenteric lns , thymus, pancreas, small intestine, and colon . darc was undetectable in large veins or arteries, including the lumen of the aorta . however, darc was readily detected in vasa vasorum around the aorta of wt mice, and expression in these vessels appeared to be further enhanced in atherosclerotic aortas in apoe

flow cytometric analysis of darc expression on microvascular ec subsets
to more precisely define the frequency and distribution of darc+ and darc– ecs, we stained single-cell suspensions from normal tissues with fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse darc mab combined with markers of leukocytes , myeloid phagocytes , rbcs , the pan-endothelial marker cd <dig>  and gp <dig>  which detects lymphatic ecs . this staining strategy combined with gating on characteristic forward and side light scatter profiles allowed simultaneous discrimination of v-ec , nv-ecs  and lecs  in multiple tissues .fig.  <dig> identification of darc+ venular endothelial cells  by flow cytometry. a gating strategy to identify ec subsets in single cell suspensions of murine lymph nodes; bec blood ecs, lec lymphatic ecs, nv-ec non-venular ec. b using the same gating strategy as in panel a, the frequency of darc+ v-ec and darc– nv-ev among becs was assessed in multiple tissues . the lower row shows the same samples stained with an isotype-matched control mab. c quantitative assessment of the frequency of darc+ v-ecs among total becs in a panel of fresh murine tissues. error bars depict mean ± sem of recovered v-ec frequencies among becs in mesenteric ln , peripheral ln , skin , adipose tissue , colon , small intestine , brain , and pancreas . ns

to obtain single-cell suspensions, a number of mouse tissues, including skin, lns, adipose tissue, colon, small intestine, brain, and pancreas, were mechanically dissociated and incubated with a mixture of proteases. pilot experiments revealed that the epitope recognized by the anti-mouse darc mab on both ecs and rbcs was susceptible to degradation by neutral proteases . we developed, for each tissue, specific digestion protocols that could reliably preserve darc staining on both rbcs and v-ecs using distinct combinations of protease cocktails and protease inhibitors .

using this approach, we assessed the frequency of v-ecs among total blood ecs  in each tissue sample by flow cytometry . the recovery of darc+ v-ecs relative to the total yield of becs was similar in skin and lns while adipose tissue, colon, small intestine, brain, and pancreas yielded a lower frequency of darc+ v-ecs among becs. several factors could potentially contribute to the observed differences between tissues in apparent v-ec frequency, as detected by flow cytometry.  v-ecs in some tissues may contain a variably sized population that does not express darc. however, given the uniformity of venular darc staining in whole mount preparations, we consider this unlikely.  proteases used to prepare single-cell suspensions for facs analysis may have destroyed darc epitopes on a fraction of v-ecs in some tissues, which could potentially lead to an underestimation of the darc+ ec fraction in those tissues. however, our tissue digestion protocols were devised to mitigate this effect as far as possible, and we monitored ter-119+ rbcs in tissue preparations to ensure conservation of darc epitopes.  the relative rate of recovery of v-ec versus nv-ec may differ between tissues.  the observed measurements may reflect true differences in v-ec abundance between tissues.

to independently address the latter two  points, we conducted a digital 3d analysis of a whole mount staining of murine omentum by quantifying the percentage of darc+ venular surface area in the total vascular  surface area. in the chosen sample, the darc+ fraction was approximately 14% of the total cd31+ surface area . by comparison, the average frequency of darc+ v-ecs among total ecs in adipose tissue was approximately 4%, as detected by flow cytometry . this apparent difference must be interpreted with caution for several reasons. firstly, in order to obtain a sufficient number of ecs from adipose tissue for facs analysis, we pooled subcutaneous and epididymal fat pads, which might have a lower venular density. secondly, in order to obtain sufficient resolution of vascular structures of interest within whole-mount preparations, we acquired 3d scans from carefully selected regions that contained, within the same field of view, all microvascular structures of interest, i.e., arterioles, capillary network, and at least one complete venular tree. this limits the choice of suitable areas and may have introduced a selection bias that could result in over-representation of venules. finally, it is also possible that ecs in different microvascular segments may differ in size. for example, if the average luminal surface area covered per v-ec is greater than that covered by capillary ecs, the venular surface area would be fractionally larger than the percentage of v-ecs. our current technology does not allow us to accurately resolve individual ecs in intact tissues, so we cannot address this issue with certainty.

interestingly, a topological analysis of the microvascular anatomy in murine mlns  <cit>  estimated that hevs composed approximately 12% of the overall vascular length, which is in good agreement with our flow cytometry data showing 14% darc+ v-ecs among becs in mln.

consistent with reports of darc expression in human skin  <cit> , murine darc was detectable by facs on subsets of lecs in lns, adipose tissue, and skin ; however, darc expression on lecs was too low to be detectable in these tissues by confocal microscopy .

darc as a pan-venular marker
next, we asked whether darc expression correlates with other known venule-associated markers. for example, p- and e-selectin are constitutively expressed  in resting skin venules  <cit> . indeed, when mrna levels of darc, selp, and sele were measured by qpcr in sorted dermal darc+ v-ecs, darc– nv-ecs, and lecs, all three mrna species were detected exclusively in v-ecs .fig.  <dig> correlation of darc expression and known venular markers. a rt-qpcr showing darc , p- , and e-selectins  expression at the mrna level in cell-sorted v-ec , nv-ec , and lec  from skin tissue. b rt-qpcr showing darc, carbohydrate sulfotransferase  <dig> , and fucosyltransferase vii  expression at the mrna level in cell-sorted v-ec, nv-ec, and lec from peripheral lymph nodes . c rt-qpcr showing darc, chst <dig>  fut <dig>  and mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule  <dig>  expression at the mrna level in cell-sorted v-ec, nv-ec, and lec from mesenteric lymph nodes . expression data are shown relative to gapdh of a pool of three experiments for each gene and expressed in arbitrary units . error bars depict mean ± sem. ns
p >  <dig> , **p ≤  <dig> , ***p ≤  <dig> . supporting data values are included in additional file  <dig>  d–f flow cytometry contour plots of darc and peripheral node addressin  expression , darc and madcam- <dig> expression , and darc and icam- <dig> expression  in ear skin, plns, and mlns. cell suspensions were gated on cd45-cd31 + gp38-bec subset for flow cytometry analysis in all the tissues. n =  <dig> experiments for each tissue




similarly, hevs  in pln express carbohydrate sulfotransferase  <dig>   <cit>  and fucosyltransferase vii   <cit> , enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 6-sulfo-slex on core  <dig> o-glycans that comprise the pnad marker  <cit> . pnad is also synthesized by most hevs in mln, which additionally expresses madcam- <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, darc mrna expression in pln and mln was restricted to v-ecs and correlated closely with chst <dig> and fut <dig> in both tissues and with madcam <dig> in mlns . these observations were confirmed at the protein level by facs analysis of pln and mln becs. of note, while almost all pnad+ and madcam-1+ becs expressed darc, up to approximately 15% of darc+ ecs were pnad– and madcam-1– . these ecs likely derived from medullary segments of the venular tree, which are lined by flat ecs and do not express vascular addressins  <cit> .

since pnad, madcam- <dig>  and the endothelial selectins are not only restricted to v-ecs, but are also subject to a strong tissue bias at steady-state  <cit> , we also stained becs for icam- <dig>  which is constitutively expressed on ecs throughout the body  <cit> . indeed, becs expressed icam- <dig> in both skin and lns, whereas pnad and madcam- <dig> were absent on dermal becs  <cit>  . interestingly, although icam- <dig> expression was more pronounced and uniform in venules than on other ecs, it was also expressed, albeit at a lower level, on most darc– nv-ecs. thus, when compared to other known venular surface moieties, darc stands out as a truly pan-venular marker that shows exquisite specificity for v-ecs and is readily detectable by ihs and flow cytometry in every murine tissue analyzed.

detection of venular darc expression by ivm
having determined that our anti-darc mab recognizes surface-expressed darc in frozen sections and whole mount preparations of murine tissues ex vivo and on intact transfectants and isolated ecs in vitro, we asked whether the mab could pinpoint microvascular darc expression in vivo. we transplanted irradiated c57bl/ <dig> mice with darc–/– bm ; at 8 weeks after bm transplantation, this resulted in absent darc expression on rbcs. thus, upon intra-arterial injection of alexa fluor- <dig> labeled anti-darc, the mab remained free to bind endothelial darc without being captured by darc+ rbcs.fig.  <dig> intravital microscopy  of leukocyte adhesion in darc+ venules. a schematic representation of ivm experiment. b alexa fluor  <dig> labeled anti-mouse darc mab staining of microvessels in subiliac lymph node. branching order designation of intranodal venular segments was performed as in ref.  <cit> . left: micrograph at the ln hilus showing a large darc+ cv  that drains venous blood into a darc– extra-lymphoid vein ; 20× objective. right: representative intranodal venular tree with branching orders identified in roman numerals. c darc expression in bm intermediate venules , collecting venules , post-sinusoids venules , and sinusoids . microvascular segment designation was as in  <cit> ; 10× objective . d intravital fluorescent micrographs of murine ear skin after injection of fluorescent leukocytes. images were taken during an initial control period , after injection of alexa fluor  <dig> labeled anti-mouse darc mab  and after subsequent injection of fitc-dextran, which delineates the intravascular compartment in all microvessels. leukocytes rolling in darc+ venules are identified by arrowheads. arteriole , venule ; 20× objective . see additional file 10: movie  <dig>  e leukocyte rolling in darc+ venules in cremaster muscle; 10× objective. arrowhead in left panel indicates a non-adherent leukocyte captured while passing through an arteriole. see additional file 11: movie  <dig>  f

luminal darc expression was readily detectable by epifluorescence ivm  <cit>  in hevs and large collecting venules in subiliac lns . epifluorescence ivm of intact skull bm  <cit>  identified prominent darc expression in intermediate venules, collecting venules, post-sinusoidal venules, and sinusoids . segmental microvascular immunoreactivity, particularly at inter-cellular junctions was also readily detected by ivm in intact ear skin and in surgically exposed cremaster muscle . by contrast, as expected, none of these ivm models showed detectable darc expression in arterioles or capillaries.

darc+ microvessels uniquely support physiologic leukocyte adhesion
to independently verify that the darc+ microvessels detected by ivm were indeed venules, we made use of the fact that leukocytes undergo constitutive selectin-mediated rolling interactions in venules, but not in capillaries or arterioles in murine ear skin  <cit> . thus, we injected fluorescent anti-darc mab into mice and then injected fluorescently tagged leukocytes into the carotid artery to quantify leukocyte rolling fractions in dermal darc+ and darc– microvessels by ivm  <cit> . all darc+ microvessels supported robust rolling interactions, whereas rolling was absent in all darc– microvessels, indicating that darc delineates specifically pro-adhesive venules, but not non-adhesive non-venular microvessels .

julius cohnheim first noted that leukocyte recruitment from blood to inflamed tissues occurs preferentially within venular segments of the microcirculation  <cit> . indeed, numerous studies have confirmed this fundamental observation in multiple tissues and a variety of species  <cit> . however, this property of venules is not explained by hemodynamic factors, but a consequence of endothelial specialization  <cit> . to date, the molecular ‘wiring diagram’ that enables v-ecs to function as the principal gatekeepers for leukocyte access to tissues remains unknown.

notwithstanding, a handful of venular surface molecules are known to be restricted to a specific vascular bed. vascular addressins, pnad  <cit>  and madcam- <dig>  <cit> , in hevs support leukocyte recruitment to secondary lymphoid organs. p- and e-selectin mediate leukocyte rolling at steady-state in skin  <cit> , bm  <cit> , and thymus  <cit> , as well as other organs during acute inflammation  <cit> . venules may also be distinguished from arterioles by higher vwf expression, although this difference is subtle and does not always allow unequivocal determination of microvascular identity  <cit> . indeed, no single marker is known to date to robustly and unequivocally discriminate between venular and non-venular endothelium in all  tissues. the existence of such a marker and an appropriate biological tool to detect that marker on intact ecs could facilitate further studies to uncover the molecular underpinnings of v-ec and nv-ec phenotype and function.

here, we explored whether a newly developed anti-mouse darc mab is useful to discriminate and isolate primary v-ecs and nv-ecs in laboratory mice. several studies have suggested that darc positively and selectively identifies v-ecs, at least in some human  <cit>  and murine tissues  <cit> . however, a rigorous analysis of the macro- and microanatomic distribution of darc has not been performed, presumably because previously available reagents did not have sufficient sensitivity and/or specificity. this is not surprising considering that darc is highly conserved among mammals; the nucleotide sequences for mouse  and rat  darc share an overall identity of 88%. when comparing protein sequences, it must be noted that darc is a serpentine receptor with four variably sized extracellular domains separated by seven transmembrane domains  <cit> . for darc detection on intact cells, antibodies must recognize extracellular epitopes on the native receptor. the ectodomains of darc in mouse and rat share  <dig> % similarity in the n-terminal ectodomain and 100%, 65%, and  <dig> % identity in ectodomains  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the overall extracellular sequence identity in mice and rats is  <dig> %, corresponding to  <dig> amino acids that differ between the two species to serve as potential epitope for non-self-reactive antibodies.

despite this high homology between mouse and rat darc, we were able to immunize rats using a stably transfected rat cell line that over-expressed mouse darc as the immunogen. this strategy yielded a mab that specifically and selectively recognized darc on transfectants, erythroid cells, and microvascular ecs. this reagent clearly delineated darc+ venules in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues of different mouse strains in vitro and in vivo. the mab was active in multiple applications, including immunofluorescence staining of whole mounts and tissue sections, facs, western blot, and ivm. after i.v. injection of fluorescent anti-darc mab, selective staining of v-ecs was readily detectable by ivm in four different tissues. in each setting, circulating leukocytes interacted exclusively with darc+ microvessels, indicating that our mab positively identifies microvessels capable of supporting leukocyte trafficking.

our analysis of restricted venular darc expression is consistent with previous reports that have shown darc+ v-ecs in plns, mlns, and brain  <cit> . in addition, we report that darc is also a venule-specific marker in many other murine tissues that had not been examined previously, including the skin, bm, adipose tissue, cremaster muscle, bladder, conjunctival vessels, small intestine, colon, peyer’s patches, thymus, and pancreas. of note, darc expression has also been reported on purkinje cells  <cit> . however, although the polyclonal serum of the immunized rat stained purkinje cells in frozen sections, our anti-mouse darc mab failed to do so. the reason for this differential immunoreactivity is unclear, but might reflect differential post-translational modification of purkinje cell-expressed darc at or near the epitope recognized by the mab. consistent with this idea, our western blot analysis showed a discrepancy between the predicted molecular mass of mouse darc  and the apparent molecular weight  of cell-derived protein. darc has multiple potential sites for post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and tyrosine sulfation, which have been described for other chemokine receptors. indeed, human darc is glycosylated in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , but it has not been determined whether darc may undergo tissue-specific post-translational modifications.

the fact that our anti-darc mab is compatible with multi-color flow cytometry to discriminate between different subsets of primary microvascular ecs allowed us to compare the composition of vascular beds from different tissues. our analysis suggests that the skin and lns contain a larger fraction of darc+ v-ecs than most other tissues, which could potentially reflect the fact that these organs undergo particularly vigorous immunosurveillance and are frequent staging grounds for immune responses against invading pathogens, requiring a large vascular surface area capable of supporting leukocyte trafficking. however, it should be cautioned that the recovery of intact ec subsets from tissue preparations is likely incomplete and may not necessarily reflect the true abundance of ecs in situ. moreover, we observed that the epitope recognized by our mab is sensitive to proteolytic degradation during tissue digestion. thus, to achieve reliable yields of darc+ v-ecs and darc– nv-ecs, it was necessary to develop customized isolation protocols for each tissue, which could potentially impact the apparent abundance of v-ecs in any given tissue.

erythrocyte-expressed darc binds inflammatory chemokines and, in doing so, rbcs serve as a sink or reservoir modulating circulating chemokine abundance and pharmacokinetics  <cit> . darc expression during murine and human erythroid development has been previously examined only at the mrna level  <cit>  and by western blot of in vitro cultured erythroblasts  <cit> . in contrast to these analytical methods, although darc was readily detectable on rbcs in peripheral blood, darc expression is even more pronounced on bm-resident erythroid progenitors  <cit> . thus, it will be important to investigate the role of erythroid and endothelial darc in bm during hematopoiesis. in addition, darc was detectable in bm sinusoidal ecs but was absent from bm-resident myeloid cells. these results differ from a recent study that reported that a polyclonal anti-darc ab stained a subset of macrophages, but not ecs, in single-cell suspensions of murine bm  <cit> . these contrasting observations remain to be fully explained, but could potentially reflect differential reactivity of the immunoreagents used or distinct darc epitope availability on specific host cell types, or unrecognized loss of darc epitope during tissue preparation, or any combination of these factors.

the physiological role of darc is rooted in its capacity to bind a variety of inflammatory chemokines  <cit> . several darc ‘knockout’ mouse strains have been generated whose phenotype indicates a regulatory role for darc on ecs and rbcs during inflammatory processes  <cit> . when inflammatory chemokines are generated in the extravascular space, they bind darc on the basolateral side of v-ecs and the complex is then transcytosed across the caveoli network to the luminal surface for presentation to passing leukocytes  <cit> . the tight restriction of darc expression to small venules focusses chemokine bioavailability to postcapillary microvessels and hence is likely to contribute to the strong bias of leukocyte migration in venular segments. of note, immunofluorescence staining of whole-mount tissues suggests that darc is concentrated at intercellular junctions between v-ecs, similar to other leukocyte traffic molecules such as cd <dig>  <cit> , icam- <dig>  <cit> , and cxcr <dig>  <cit> . the physiological significance of this observation remains undetermined.

interestingly, although darc expression was uniform and prominent in pcvs and in small to mid-size cvs in every murine tissue examined, it was absent in larger cvs and veins, indicating that darc is not merely a marker of ecs exposed to deoxygenated blood. in fact, the environmental signal that regulate microvascular darc expression remain to be identified. it is also not clear whether all ecs that interact with blood-borne leukocytes inevitably express darc. in fact, our results suggest that this is unlikely since atherosclerotic plaques in aortas of apoe
–/– mice did not display luminal darc. however, darc+ microvessels were readily identified within the aortic wall in c57bl/ <dig> mice, and darc+ vasa vasorum were even more prominent in aortas of apoe
–/– mice. thus, a network of microvessels that include bona fide venules supplies large arteries prone to atherosclerosis in mice. whether and to what extent these vessels can contribute to the recruitment of atherogenic leukocytes remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report the generation and extensive characterization of a mab against mouse darc/ackr1/cd <dig>  using this new biological tool, we demonstrate that darc is truly a pan-venular marker. this mab will be useful for future studies on the cellular and molecular underpinnings of segmental endothelial specialization in the peripheral microvasculature.
