BACKGROUND
given the emerging evidence that common environmental carcinogens play a significant role in cancer  <cit> , increased attention has been paid to molecular mechanisms through which pollutants affect tumor formation, invasion and/or progression . historically, most studies on environmental chemical carcinogenesis centered on the ability of genotoxic chemicals to damage dna, induce mutations, and initiate cancers . however, recent data suggest alternative, non-genotoxic pathways involving cellular receptors that can be activated by environmental ligands. one such receptor is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor . the ahr is the only ligand-activated member of the per-arnt-sim  family of transcription factors, all of which play important roles as environmental- and physiological stress-sensing proteins  <cit> . the ahr has been best studied for its ability to be activated by dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  <cit> , all of which are high priority chemicals on the u.s. agency for toxic substances and disease registry list of pollutants of greatest concern to human health .

ligand-bound ahr induces p <dig> enzymes such as cyp1b <dig> and cyp1a <dig>  which are capable of generating mutagenic intermediates. however, more recent work suggests that the ahr, which is expressed at aberrantly high levels and is chronically active in several cancers, plays an ongoing role in tumor progression by enhancing tumor invasion and migration . the contribution of the ahr to the later stages of cancer may be mediated by non-genotoxic endogenous ligands, which chronically drive ahr transcriptional activity  <cit> . here, it is postulated that environmental ligands mimic this effect and drive cancer progression, at least in part, by increasing the development and/or function of cells exhibiting cancer stem-like cell  properties.

recent evidence suggests that invasion and eventual metastasis leading to patient death is mediated, to a disproportionate extent, by chemoresistant, long-lived cancer stem cells, sometimes referred to as tumor-initiating cells . breast cancer stem cells can be defined by  expression of genes associated with ‘normal’ tissue stem cells  and with invasion and migration  ;  formation of spheroid colonies in ultra-low adherence cultures  <cit> ;  elevated levels of aldehyde dehydrogenases , enzymes associated with chemoresistance, high histological tumor grade, and poor prognoses  <cit> ;  the propensity to self-renew while spawning progenitor cells  <cit> ; and  an increased tumor initiation capacity in xenografts  <cit> . here, we operationally define ‘breast cancer stem-like cells’  as tumor cells robustly expressing the five aforementioned characteristics in a continuum of ‘stem-ness’ in which some cells are more stem-like than others at any given time. clearly, identifying factors responsible for the development of cells with cancer stem cell qualities is an important step towards understanding why many patients relapse, even several years after remission.

the ahr plays an important role in tissue-specific embryonic development, hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, pluripotent stem cell and neural stem cell differentiation, and megakaryocyte/erythroid stem cell growth . here, complementing parameters of ‘stem-ness’, including aldh enzyme activity, stem cell-, invasion- and migration-associated gene expression, tumorsphere formation, migration rate, chemoresistance, and tumor formation at limiting concentrations in xenografts were assessed to test the hypothesis that the ahr similarly influences development and function of bcslcs. the potential for the ahr to directly interact with the sox <dig> gene, a master regulator of normal tissue-specific stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, was of particular interest.

these studies were performed primarily with er−/pr−/her2− triple negative breast cancer  cell lines: hs578t, derived from a carcinomosarcoma, and sum <dig>  derived from an inflammatory breast cancer . tnbc lines were selected for these studies primarily because no effective targeted therapeutic is yet available for this class of breast cancers and because we wanted to evaluate ahr signaling in the absence of its well-established interactions with the estrogen receptor  <cit> . results in those lines were compared with genomic outcomes in  <dig> breast cancer cell lines and more than  <dig>  primary cancers. our results show that the ahr is involved in the control of phenotypic, genomic, and functional cancer stem cell markers in er−/pr−/her2− cells, strongly implicating an important role for the ahr in acquisition of stem cell-like qualities, encouraging development of ahr-targeted therapeutics, and raising the possibility that environmental ahr ligands may drive bcslc development or activity.

RESULTS
ahr expression is elevated in aldh1high tnbcs
we have previously published data demonstrating elevated expression of transcriptionally  active ahr in human breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . the expression of nuclear ahr in er−/pr−/her2− human breast cancer-derived hs578t cells and in inflammatory er−/pr−/her2− breast cancer-derived sum <dig> cells  was consistent with these reports. furthermore, a predominance of nuclear ahr in primary human breast cancers , but not in normal breast tissue , supports the conclusion that the ahr is constitutively active in primary cancers as well. importantly, non-epithelial cells did not express ahr, normal epithelial cells in ducts had a low level of ahr staining, similar to our previous findings in rats  <cit> , and all ahr staining seen in normal epithelial cells was cytoplasmic, indicating inactive ahr. note that the stains presented here are representative of similar staining observed in  <dig> human breast cancer samples fixed on a tissue microarray.

work from several laboratories indicates a role for the ahr in tissue-specific stem cell development , suggesting a general role for the ahr in stem cell biology. we and others have demonstrated that the ahr is highly expressed and constitutively active in breast cancers and that its activity correlates with tumor aggressiveness . since cancer stem cells contribute to tumor progression, we postulated that the ahr plays a role in the development of breast cancer cells with stem cell-like characteristics .

several investigators have shown that cd44+/cd24− cell staining is not an entirely consistent indicator of tumor initiating ability in er−/pr−/her2− breast cancer cells due to over-staining of tnbcs . over-expression or non-specific staining for these prototypic cancer stem cell markers also precluded their use in our studies . therefore, aldh activity, which appears to be a more selective functional marker for tnbc stem-like cells  <cit> , was used here for marking of and enriching for cancer stem-like cells.

a fluorescence-based aldh <dig> enzyme activity assay  <cit>  was used to quantify aldh <dig> activity in tnbc hs578t cells, which express relatively high levels of transcriptionally active ahr  <cit> . cells were sorted by flow cytometry into aldh1high and aldh1low subsets. approximately 5 % of hs578t cells expressed high levels of aldh <dig> activity , a result consistent with previous studies of bcslcs  <cit> . to determine if the ahr and an ahr target gene, cyp1b <dig>  are more highly represented in aldhhigh cells, ahr and cyp1b <dig> mrnas were quantified by rt-qpcr. ahr and cyp1b <dig> mrnas were significantly higher in aldhhigh cells than aldhlow cells .fig.  <dig> 
ahr and cyp1b <dig> expression is increased in aldh1high hs578t cells.  er−/pr−/her2− hs578t cells were stained with aldefluor™ in the presence or absence of diethylaminobenzaldehyde , a specific aldh inhibitor, and aldh activity  was quantified by flow cytometry. regions were set using dot plots from deab-treated cells. data are representative of  <dig> experiments.  ahr and cyp1b <dig> mrna expression in sorted aldhhigh and aldhlow cells was quantified by rt-qpcr. data from three independent experiments were analyzed using the pfaffl method  <cit> , normalized to the gapdh signal, and presented as mean fold-change from aldhlow ± standard error. asterisks indicate a significant increase in the mrna fold-change, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> 



to determine if elevated ahr and cyp1b <dig> expression in aldh1high cells reflects a role for the ahr in maintaining stem cell properties and if environmental ahr ligands have the potential to increase these properties in tnbcs, ahr expression or activity was modulated with a doxycycline -inducible ahr-specific shrna , ahr inhibitors   <cit> , or four ahr agonists:  6-formylindolocarbazole , a high affinity ahr ligand, tryptophan photo-metabolite, and potential endogenous ligand  <cit> ;  β-naphthoflavone , a flavone with moderate affinity for the ahr;   <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzodioxin , a high affinity, persistent environmental ahr ligand and ‘gold standard’ ahr ligand; or   <dig>  dimethylbenzanthracene , a readily metabolizable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

dox-induced shahr or the ahr-specific inhibitor ch <dig> significantly reduced  ahr expression and ahr-dependent  reporter activity, respectively , significantly decreased  the percentage of aldhhigh cells by over 80 % , and reduced overall aldh <dig> activity in the entire hs578t population , suggesting that ‘constitutively active’  ahr maintains baseline aldh <dig> levels. similar data were obtained with our recently described ahr inhibitor, cb <dig>  <cit>  . conversely, ficz, β-nf, tcdd, or dmba significantly increased the percentage of aldh1high cells and aldh <dig> activity in the entire hs578t population . in all cases, ahr agonist-induced increases were significantly inhibited by ch <dig> . similar results were obtained with immortalized but non-malignant triple negative mcf-10f cells  and with er+ luminal-type mcf <dig> cells  <cit>  . these results suggest that ahr ligand-induced aldh up-regulation is likely generalizable to different breast cancer subtypes.fig.  <dig> ahr modulation alters aldh <dig> activity in hs578t cells.  wildtype or doxycycline -inducible shahr-transduced hs578t cells were transfected with cmv-green control plasmid and ahr-driven pgudluc reporter and treated for 48 hours with 10 μm ahr inhibitor ch <dig> or with doxycycline  to induce the shahr. ahr mrna was quantified by rt-qpcr and normalized to gapdh mrna expression. pgudluc activity was assayed by luminescence and normalized to cmv-green expression. values were normalized to ahr or pgudluc levels in untreated hs578t cells. data are presented as mean ± standard error. left panel n =  <dig>  middle panel n =  <dig>  right panel n =  <dig>  asterisks indicate a significant decrease in the mrna fold-change or reporter activity, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> .  representative flow cytometry plots of aldefluor™ staining of wildtype hs578t cells or dox-inducible shahr-transduced hs578t cells treated for 48 hours are presented. dox-inducible shahr transduced hs578t cells were treated for 48 hours with dox. hs578t wildtype cells were treated for 48 hours with vehicle, 10 μm ch <dig>  1 μm β-nf,  <dig>  μm ficz,  <dig> nm tcdd, or 1 μm dmba. regions representing aldhhigh cells were drawn based on the signal generated in the presence of deab.  hs578t cells were treated as in  and assayed for the percentage of aldhhigh cells. data were normalized to results obtained with naïve cells  and presented as mean fold-change from naive ± standard error. number of experiments by condition: shahr-dox n =  <dig>  shahr + dox n =  <dig>  dmso n =  <dig>  ch <dig> n =  <dig>  ficz n =  <dig>  ficz + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  β-nf n =  <dig>  β-nf + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  tcdd n =  <dig>  tcdd + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  dmba n =  <dig>  and dmba + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  asterisks indicate a significant decrease in the percentage of aldhhigh cells, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> . a cross indicates a significant increase in aldhhigh cells, +

increasing ahr activity increases expression of bcslc-related genes
to determine if several stem cell-associated genes are regulated by the ahr, hs578t cells were treated for 48 hours with vehicle or ficz, stained with aldefluortm, and sorted for aldhhigh and aldhlow cells. consistent with previous studies demonstrating bcslc plasticity  <cit> , pre-sorting hs578t aldhhigh and aldhlow cells prior to treatment and culture for 48 hours was precluded by the tendency for sorted hs578t subpopulations to revert to the original distribution of aldhhigh  and aldhlow  cells within 24 hours .

as expected, vehicle-treated aldhhigh cells produced higher levels of aldh1a <dig>  ahr, cyp1b <dig>  and cyp1a <dig> than vehicle-treated aldhlow cells . aldh3a <dig> mrna, previously associated with ahr activity  <cit> , was not detected  in either vehicle or ahr agonist -treated hs578t cells . aldhhigh cells also expressed significantly higher levels of seven of the eight stem cell-associated genes studied  with msi <dig> being the exception . as expected from the aldh enzyme activity assay , ficz treatment increased aldh1a <dig>  cyp1b <dig>  and cyp1a <dig> expression in both aldhlow and aldhhigh cells . consistent with previous studies, ahr ligand induced significantly higher levels of cyp1a <dig> than cyp1b <dig> , while baseline cyp1b <dig> levels tended to be higher than cyp1a <dig> levels  <cit> . ficz also increased expression of seven of eight stem cell-associated genes in both cell subsets , again with msi <dig> being the outlier . these results support the hypothesis that constitutively active and/or exogenous agonist-induced ahr up-regulates multiple stem cell-associated genes. several of these genes express multiple consensus ahr response elements , suggesting that they may be directly regulated by the ahr.fig.  <dig> ahr hyper-activation increases expression of stem cell-associated genes. hs578t cells were treated with vehicle or  <dig>  μm ficz for 48 hours, sorted into aldhhigh and aldhlow cell populations, and then assayed by rt-qpcr for the relative levels of the eight stem cell-associated genes indicated. gene expression was then normalized to gapdh levels and fold-change from vehicle-treated aldhlow or aldhhigh cells was calculated. data from nine independent experiments are presented as the mean fold-change ± standard error for all genes except for cyp1a <dig>  in which six independent experiments are presented. in all cases, statistical significance was determined with the wilcoxon rank sum test to determine if the distributions of results, relative to  <dig> as the standard , are different between the comparison groups. asterisks indicate a significant increase in the mrna fold-change, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> .  expression levels of stem cell-associated genes were normalized to expression levels in vehicle-treated aldhlow cells and the distribution of outcomes from vehicle-treated aldhhigh versus vehicle-treated aldhlow cells compared.  stem cell-associated gene expression levels were normalized to expression levels in vehicle-treated aldhlow cells and the distribution of outcomes from vehicle-treated aldhlow versus ficz-treated aldhlow cells was compared.  stem cell-associated gene expression levels were normalized to expression levels in vehicle-treated aldhhigh cells and the distribution of outcomes from vehicle-treated aldhhigh versus ficz-treated aldhhigh cells was compared

given the pivotal role for sox <dig> in stem cell self-renewal, bcslc development and breast cancer outcomes , ahr/sox2-specific chip assays were performed to determine if the ahr directly interacts with the sox <dig> promoter. chip assays measuring ahr-cyp1b <dig> promoter binding served as positive controls  <cit> . indeed, there was a significant basal level of ahr binding to both cyp1b <dig> and sox <dig> promoter fragments , each of which contains several ahr response elements within 500 bp of the pcr primer binding sites . ahr inhibition with ch <dig> significantly decreased ahr-sox <dig> and ahr-cyp1b <dig> binding . ahr hyper-activation with ficz significantly increased ahr-cyp1b <dig> and ahr-sox <dig> binding by approximately 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively . the ahr-sox <dig> increase was blocked with ch <dig> treatment . furthermore, treatment of sum <dig> cells or mcf- <dig> cells, which are known to express relatively high sox <dig> levels  <cit> , with ficz, tcdd, or β-nf consistently increased nuclear sox <dig> , a result consistent with increased levels of transcriptionally active sox <dig> following ahr hyper-activation. finally, ectopic sox <dig> expression significantly increased aldh <dig> activity . these data strongly suggest that the ahr directly interacts with sox <dig>  a critical bcslc-associated gene, which in turn regulates aldh <dig> expression, an enzyme associated with chemoresistance  <cit> .fig.  <dig> modulation of ahr activity affects ahr binding to cyp1b <dig> and sox <dig> promoters and sox <dig> protein production.  hs578t cells were treated with vehicle, 10 μm ahr inhibitor ch <dig>   <dig>  μm ficz, or  <dig>  μm ficz + 10 μm ahr inhibitor ch <dig> for 48 hours and chip assays were performed with human ahr-specific antibody and cyp1b1- or sox2-specific promoters as described in the materials and methods. data are presented as mean fold-change ± standard error, igg control n =  <dig>  vehicle n =  <dig>  ch <dig> n =  <dig>  ficz n =  <dig>  ficz + ch223191 =  <dig>  an asterisk indicates a significant increase relative to vehicle controls, *p < <dig> . a pound sign indicates a significant decrease relative to vehicle controls, #

increasing ahr activity increases expression of migration- and invasion-associated genes
bcslcs are more invasive than the bulk tumor population and have increased expression of migration- and invasion-associated markers  <cit> . to determine if the increase in stem cell markers described above correlates with markers of migration and invasion, hs578t cells were treated with vehicle or ficz for 48 hours, sorted for aldhhigh and aldhlow cells, and evaluated for expression of seven genes associated with increased tumor migration and/or invasion. as seen for stem cell markers , aldhhigh cells expressed significantly higher levels  of snai <dig>  twist  <dig>  twist <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and vim than aldhlow cells, with twist <dig> showing the greatest fold-change . although snai <dig> and fn <dig> tended to be higher in aldhhigh cells, neither was statistically significant in nine independent experiments. these data are consistent with the bcslc properties of aldhhigh cells. ahr hyper-activation with ficz significantly  increased snai <dig>  twist <dig>  twist <dig>  and vim in both aldhhigh and aldhlow cells  and tgfb <dig> was marginally increased in ficz-treated aldhlow cells .fig.  <dig> ahr hyper-activation increases expression of migration and invasion-associated genes in hs578t cells. hs578t cells were treated with vehicle or  <dig>  μm ficz for 48 hours, sorted into aldhhigh and aldhlow cells, and then assayed by rt-qpcr for the relative levels of the seven migration and invasion-associated genes indicated. gene expression was then normalized to gapdh mrna levels and fold-change from vehicle-treated aldhlow or aldhhigh cells was calculated. data from nine independent experiments are presented as mean fold-change ± standard error. in all cases, statistical significance was determined with the wilcoxon rank sum test to determine if the distributions of results, relative to  <dig> as the standard , are different between the comparison groups. asterisks indicate a significant increase in the mrna fold-change, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> .  migration- and invasion-associated gene expression levels were normalized to expression levels in vehicle-treated aldhlow cells and the distribution of outcomes from vehicle-treated aldhhigh versus vehicle-treated aldhlow cells was compared.  gene expression levels were normalized to expression levels in vehicle-treated aldhlow cells and the distribution of outcomes from vehicle-treated aldhlow versus ficz-treated aldhlow cells was compared.  gene expression levels were normalized to expression levels in vehicle-treated aldhhigh cells and the distribution of outcomes from vehicle-treated aldhhigh versus ficz-treated aldhhigh cells was compared



as a functional readout of migration, the effects of ahr modulation on the ability of sum <dig> cells to migrate in a 48 hour scratch-wound assay were determined. sum <dig> cells were chosen for this experiment since, unlike hs578t cells, aldhhigh sum <dig> cells remained aldhhigh in vitro for at least 96 hours, unless the ahr inhibitor, ch <dig> was added . aldhlow, sum <dig> cells tended to revert to aldhhigh phenotype but this reversion was inhibited by ch <dig> treatment . similar results describing the plasticity of stem-like cells have been previously reported  <cit> .

as expected, vehicle-treated aldhhigh cells ‘repaired’ the wound significantly faster than vehicle-treated aldhlow cells, as quantified by a decrease in exposed surface area . furthermore, wound repair with both subpopulations was significantly inhibited by ch <dig> treatment . similar data were obtained with unsorted hs578t and sum <dig> cells and with another ahr inhibitor, cb <dig> . no cell divisions were observed over this 48-hour period as assessed by cfse staining and analysis by flow cytometry . in addition, both  <dig>  μm ficz and  <dig> nm tcdd significantly accelerated migration of unsorted, aldhlow , and aldhhigh sum <dig> subsets . a significant increase in migration rate also was seen for aldhhigh cells following a 48-hour treatment with a lower tcdd dose .fig.  <dig> ahr down-regulation decreases migration of sum <dig> cells.  presented are representative images of sum <dig> cell migration at  <dig> and 48 hours after cells were sorted into aldhhigh and aldhlow populations, cultured to confluence, scratched, and treated with vehicle or 10 μm ch <dig>  data are representative of three independent experiments. black lines indicate the borders of the original scratch.  sum <dig> cells were treated as in  and percent exposed area was quantified. data from three experiments were normalized to results obtained with naïve cells and presented as mean percent exposed area ± standard error. asterisks indicate a significant increase in exposed area, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> . a cross indicates a significant decrease in exposed area, +

generalization of the correlation between ahr or cyp1b <dig> and bcslc- and invasion/migration-associated genes
the experiments described above confirm that ahr hyper-activation with ficz induces both bcslc- and migration/invasion-associated genes in an ahr-dependent fashion in hs578t cells. if these associations are generalizable to other breast cancer cell lines, then it would be predicted that ahr expression and expression of cyp1b <dig>  as a marker for ahr activity, would correlate, in multiple breast cancer cell lines, with expression of the bcslc- and migration/invasion-associated gene sets identified in hs578t cells. for such an analysis, we used microarray/rna-seq data compiled by the broad institute on  <dig> primary human breast cancer cell lines, i.e. the cancer cell line encyclopedia   <cit> . use of cyp1b <dig> as a marker for ahr activity in this context is supported by  our findings  <cit> , and those of others  <cit> , demonstrating that baseline cyp1b <dig> mrna levels are maintained in part by ‘constitutively active’ ahr in human breast cancer cell lines, and  the observation that, of all breast cancer cell lines in the ccle, the nearest neighbor to ahr of > <dig>  gene probes is cyp1b <dig> . gene set enrichment analyses  were performed with the aim of testing whether the gene set listed in table  <dig> is significantly and coordinately correlated with ahr or cyp1b <dig> expression. indeed, ahr expression was significantly correlated  with the putative ahr target gene set shown in table  <dig> . similarly, there was a significant correlation between cyp1b <dig> and the expression of the putative ahr target gene set . interestingly, the ‘outlier’ with a negative correlation score for both the ahr and cyp1b <dig> analyses, was msi <dig> , the one stem cell-associated gene we tested that did not increase following ahr hyper-activation .

to generalize results to primary human cancers, a similar gsea analysis was performed using transcriptomic data from  <dig> primary human breast cancers catalogued in the cancer genome atlas  database  <cit>  and  <dig> primary human breast cancers in the curtis database  <cit> . as shown for cell lines in the ccle, there was a significant association  between ahr expression and the gene set listed in table  <dig> . a stronger association  was seen between cyp1b <dig> expression and expression of the putative ahr target gene set . as with the ccle database, msi <dig> was not correlated with either ahr or cyp1b <dig> in the tcga database . similar data were obtained using the curtis dataset . collectively, data mined from three large breast cancer databases  show a significant and generalizable association between ahr or ahr activity  and cancer stem cell- and migration/invasion-associated gene sets, an outcome consistent with regulation of these genes by a constitutively active  ahr.

decreasing ahr activity decreases tumorsphere formation
bcslc can form tumorspheres and produce progenitor cells in ultra-low adherence conditions over several passages . to determine if the ahr contributes to this functional readout of bcslcs, hs578t cells were cultured in mammocult media under ultra-low adherence conditions and ahr activity and expression were modulated with ch <dig> or with a dox-inducible shahr. both the size and total number of tumorspheres were significantly reduced  by ch <dig> or a dox-induced shahr in primary, secondary , tertiary, and quaternary  cultures. no effect on cell viability  was seen . similar results were obtained with cb <dig> . these results suggest that the ahr regulates tumorsphere formation and the ability of bcslcs to  divide and/or differentiate into progenitor cells in low-adherence, selective conditions, and/or controls the ability of progenitor cells to divide.fig.  <dig> ahr down-regulation decreases hs578t tumorsphere formation.  dox-inducible shahr-transduced hs578t  or wildtype hs578t cells were left untreated or treated for 48 hours with vehicle, doxycycline, or 10 μm ch <dig> as indicated and cultured in mammocult media under ultra-low adherence conditions. representative images of primary  and secondary  tumorspheres are presented. the percentage of viable cells is included on each image. vehicle and ch <dig> treatment groups are representative of six independent experiments. shahr, no dox and shahr + dox treatment groups are representative of five independent experiments.  hs578t cells were treated as in  and tumorsphere formation was quantified. data from six experiments were normalized to results obtained with naïve cells and presented as mean fold-changes from naive ± standard error. asterisks indicate a significant decrease in the percentage of tumorspheres, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> 



ahr controls expression of cancer stem cell-associated properties in an inflammatory breast cancer cell line
ibc is a particularly aggressive form of cancer characterized by a ~50 % survival rate at 2 years  <cit> . to determine if ahr control of stem cell characteristics is generalizable to this cancer subtype, sum <dig> cells, derived from an ibc, were studied for expression of ahr and cyp1b <dig> in aldhhigh and aldhlow subpopulations, for the contribution of the ahr to aldh <dig> activity, and for the ability to form tumorspheres. as shown for tnbc hs578t cells, aldhhigh sum <dig> cells expressed significantly higher ahr and cyp1b <dig> levels than aldhlow cells . ch <dig> or ahr-specific shrna significantly decreased ahr activity or expression greater than 60 % , the percentage of aldhhigh cells by over 80 % , and overall aldh <dig> activity in the entire population . conversely, ficz, β-nf, tcdd, and dmba significantly increased the percentage of aldhhigh cells  and ch <dig> treatment in tandem significantly reduced this increase . finally, fewer and smaller tumorspheres were formed following ch <dig> treatment . no changes in cell viability were detected . these data parallel those found with hs578t cells  and suggest that ahr control of these stem cell properties is generalizable to other er− breast cancer subtypes.fig.  <dig> ahr modulation affects markers associated with bcslc in sum <dig> cells.  ahr, cyp1b <dig> and aldh1a <dig> mrna expression in sorted aldhhigh and aldhlow sum <dig> cells was quantified by rt-qpcr. data from three independent experiments were analyzed using the pfaffl method, normalized to the gapdh signal, and presented as mean fold-change from aldhlow ± standard error. asterisks indicate a significant increase in the mrna fold-change, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> .  wildtype or dox-inducible shahr-transduced sum <dig> cells were transfected, treated and quantified as indicated in fig. 2a. data are presented as mean ± standard error. left panel n =  <dig>  center panel n =  <dig>  right panel n =  <dig>  asterisks indicate a significant decrease in the mrna fold-change or reporter activity, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> .  representative flow cytometry plots of aldefluor™ staining of dox-inducible shahr-transduced sum <dig> cells cultured, treated, and depicted as described in fig. 2b.  dox-inducible shahr-transduced or wildtype sum <dig> cells were treated, stained, and quantified as in fig. 2c. data were normalized to results obtained with naïve cells  and presented as mean fold-change from naive ± standard error. shahr-dox n =  <dig>  shahr + dox n =  <dig>  dmso n =  <dig>  ch <dig> n =  <dig>  ficz n =  <dig>  ficz + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  β-nf n =  <dig>  β-nf + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  tcdd n =  <dig>  tcdd + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  dmba n =  <dig>  and dmba + ch <dig> n =  <dig>  asterisks indicate a significant decrease in the percentage of aldhhigh cells, *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , ***p < <dig> . a cross indicates a significant increase in aldhhigh cells, +

decreasing ahr activity decreases chemoresistance, a hallmark of bcslcs
chemoresistance is another widely studied functional bcslc marker  <cit> . to determine if the ahr influences chemoresistance, aldhhigh and aldhlow hs578t cells were treated with titrated doses of adriamycin or paclitaxel, chemotherapeutics with distinct mechanisms of action, with or without ch <dig>  cell viability was assayed 24 hours later. as expected of bcslcs, aldhhigh cells were more resistant to the chemotherapeutics than aldhlow cells  in table 2). ch <dig> had no effect on viability . however, ch <dig> significantly  increased sensitivity to both adriamycin and paclitaxel in both aldhlow and aldhhigh cells . the ec <dig> of adriamycin-treated aldhhigh cells  was three times greater than that of adriamycin + ch223191-treated cells . these results are consistent with previous reports demonstrating ahr control of chemotherapeutic-induced breast cancer cell apoptosis  <cit> . furthermore, they indicate that migration/invasion-associated genes, and functional markers of bcslcs  are influenced by the ahr.table  <dig> half maximal effective concentrations  of two chemotherapeutics in the presence or absence of an ahr inhibitor

shahr-mediated ahr knockdown decreases expansion of tumors initiated with aldhhigh and aldhlow sum <dig> cells
cancer stem cells tend to generate tumors more efficiently in vivo than non-cancer stem cells . to determine if ahr, which increases expression of stem cell-associated properties in vitro, influences tumor cell fate in vivo, sum <dig> cells, stably transduced with a dox-inducible shahr , were sorted and  <dig>  aldhhigh and aldhlow cells were injected into the right and left mammary fat pads, respectively, of female nod/scid mice. half of the mice were given doxycycline-containing water to induce the shahr. aldhhigh cells generated palpable tumors more rapidly and these tumors grew faster than aldhlow cells . furthermore, dox-induced shahr significantly reduced growth rates from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm/day in aldhhigh and aldhlow cells, respectively . consistent with in vitro experiments, ahr, cyp1b <dig>  aldh1a <dig>  and sox <dig> mrna levels were reduced in tumors from doxycycline-treated mice .fig.  <dig> ahr down-regulation decreases tumor formation in xenograft mice.  doxycycline-inducible shahr-expressing sum <dig> cells were sorted for aldhhigh or aldhlow activity and  <dig>  cells were grafted into the mammary fat pads of nod/scid mice . tumor volumes were measured over the next 56 days. data are presented as mean tumor volume ± standard error; p < <dig> . the average rate of tumor growth of tumors initiated with aldhhigh cells  was significantly different than the rate of growth of tumors initiated with aldhlow cells , p < <dig> . a cross indicates a significant increase in average tumor size beginning at day  <dig>  +

although aldh <dig> activity and aldh <dig> expression have been identified as a valid marker for bcslcs  <cit>  and despite aldhhigh cells having formed tumors sooner than aldhlow cells in the experiment described above, we wanted to confirm that aldhhigh cells, in our hands, exhibit a hallmark property of cancer stem cells in vivo, i.e. efficient formation of tumors following xenografting. therefore, sum <dig> cells, stably transduced with a different doxycycline-inducible shahr, were sorted into aldhhigh and aldhlow subpopulations and xenografted at titered numbers  into the mammary fat pads of female nod/scid recipients . tumor volume was then tracked over a 69-day period. as predicted of tumors derived from cells with cancer stem-like properties, tumors generated from aldhhigh cells were detected sooner than tumors generated from aldhlow cells at each respective cell number, thereby demonstrating a consistently higher efficiency of tumor initiation . tumors grew faster after xenograft of  <dig>  aldhhigh as compared with aldhlow cells. furthermore, induction of shahr with doxycycline significantly delayed tumor formation and subsequent growth of tumors generated from both aldhhigh cells and aldhlow cells regardless of cell number transferred to recipients. these data strongly support the use of aldh activity as a marker for breast cancer cells with cancer stem cell-like properties and the conclusion that ahr influences the efficiency with which all cells along a continuum of low to high aldh expression can initiate tumors.fig.  <dig> ahr down-regulation decreases the efficiency of tumor formation in vivo. titered numbers  of sorted aldhhigh or aldhlow dox-inducible shahr-transduced sum <dig> cells were grafted into the mammary fat pads of nod/scid mice . mice were given water + 5 % sucrose or water with doxycycline + 5 % sucrose to induce the shahr. data are presented as mean tumor volume ± standard error. asterisks indicate a significant difference in tumor volume, p < <dig> . statistical analyses were not performed when none of the mice in a given control group developed tumors at that time point

discussion
accumulating data suggest that the ahr plays an important role in breast cancer, in general, and in progression to end-stage invasion and migration in particular. for example, the ahr is hyper-expressed and transcriptionally active in most tnbc and ibc cell lines, and its expression is associated with tumor invasion  <cit> . the data presented here strongly suggest that the ahr drives tumorigenesis in part through induction or maintenance of cells with cancer stem cell-like properties.

the involvement of the ahr in bcslc biology is suggested by its emerging role in normal tissue-specific stem cell development. for example, the ahr, presumably activated by endogenous ligand, helps maintain hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and block differentiation  <cit> , and drives bipotential blood stem cell differentiation  <cit> . ahr repression in embryonic stem cells likely maintains pluripotency, and the ahr controls embryonic stem cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes  <cit> . data presented here extend these studies by demonstrating that the ahr is involved in the phenotype , genomics , and function  of bcslcs.

elevated aldh expression identifies bcslcs and is associated with increased expression of chemoresistance proteins, increased tumor cell invasion, higher tumor grade, and poor survival in breast cancer patients  <cit> . indeed, in our hands, aldhhigh cells exhibited increased chemoresistance , elevated expression of stem cell- and migration/invasion-associated genes , faster migration , higher tumor-initiating capacity and increased tumor growth rates in vivo . ahr control of chemoresistance is particularly interesting given important recent studies demonstrating that tcdd decreases and ahr inhibition increases apoptosis induced by uv light or chemotherapeutics in six breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . ahr-mediated chemoresistance takes on even greater significance given recent studies showing that chemoresistance may be a more meaningful marker of metastatic behavior than markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  <cit> . these data support the hypothesis that ahr inhibitors may represent effective, targeted therapeutics when used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics. collectively, these data strongly support the conclusion that aldhhigh cells are at least breast cancer stem-like cells if not bona fide breast cancer stem cells.

we previously demonstrated that constitutively active ahr in breast cancer lines preferentially drives cyp1b <dig> expression while an exogenous ligand, e.g. dmba, tends to induce greater fold-increases in cyp1a <dig> than cyp1b <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, higher relative levels of cyp1b <dig> were noted in aldhhigh cells, as compared with aldhlow cells , suggesting the possibility that a higher level of ahr activity, as represented by baseline cyp1b <dig> levels, characterizes aldhhigh-stem like cells.

ahr hyper-activation with ficz increased expression of aldh1a <dig> and stem cell-associated genes demonstrating a causal relationship between ahr activity and expression of these genes . this gene set has been implicated in generating both normal tissue stem cells and bcslcs. notch <dig> and notch <dig> are critical to symmetric and asymmetric cell division, stem cell differentiation in embryonic and adult stem cells  <cit> , and are potential therapeutic targets  <cit> . bmi <dig> is required for the maintenance of somatic stem cells through repression of cellular senescence and cell death  <cit> , and is involved in the control of bcslc growth, chemoresistance, and tumorsphere formation  <cit> . stella is involved in maintenance of gene-specific dna methylation in the early embryo, and is a marker for some bcslc types  <cit> . sox <dig>  oct <dig> and nanog are traditional embryonic stem cell markers used to reprogram cells to a pluripotent state, and are expressed at elevated levels in bcslcs  <cit> . sox <dig> is up-regulated in tnbcs and has been implicated in tumorsphere formation and control of tumor initiation  <cit> . therefore, the finding that the ahr directly interacts with the sox <dig> promoter  strongly suggests that the ahr is at the apex of an important signaling pathway that controls cancer progression by increasing phenotypic and functional expression of cancer stem cell-associated markers within the tumor cell population.

our data also suggest that the ahr plays a key role in regulating bcslc migration. snail, slug, twist <dig>  twist <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and fibronectin , which contribute to cell invasion and cell migration  <cit> , are all up-regulated in ficz-treated aldhhigh cells . as would be predicted from these results, ahr inhibition slows  and ahr hyper-activation accelerates  cell migration in the scratch-wound assay.

importantly, these findings on ahr-regulated genes appear generalizable since strong correlations were seen between ahr or cyp1b <dig> and the stem cell- and migration/invasion-associated gene sets in databases of  <dig> human breast cancer cell lines characterized in the ccle and over  <dig> primary human breast cancers catalogued in the tcga and curtis databases . furthermore, these results suggest the possibility that the ahr contributes to cell invasion and migration through up-regulation of stem cell- and invasion/migration-associated genes.

consistent up-regulation of cyp1b <dig> in breast cancers  <cit>  suggests that this enzyme plays an important role in cancer, potentially by influencing cell migration  <cit> . it is, therefore, formally possible that at least some of the effects observed here reflect ahr ligand binding to cyp1b <dig>  while this possibility cannot be ruled out, particularly for ligands such as ficz, which are metabolized by cyp1b <dig>  <cit> , it seems unlikely as a general rule since tcdd, which is not metabolized by cyp1b <dig> and does not bind cyp1b <dig> , generates the same outcomes  as the other ligands.

ahr inhibition or knockdown in either hs578t or sum <dig> cells significantly reduced the number and size of tumorspheres formed in low adherence conditions over several generations . the formation of these colonies is generally considered to be a function of asymmetric bcslc division and production of progenitor cells which constitute the majority of the cells in the spheres  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the ahr controls the asymmetric differentiation of bcslc and/or the growth of their progenitors.

furthermore, ahr knockdown with either of two shahr constructs significantly slowed the initiation and outgrowth of both aldhlow and aldhhigh cell-derived tumors . this decrease in tumor outgrowth was accompanied by a decrease in cyp1b <dig>  aldh1a <dig>  and sox <dig> expression , further linking ahr activity to expression of these genes.

results presented here are reminiscent of several studies demonstrating that baseline  ahr activity in immortalized cells favors tumor growth or aggressive behavior . paradoxically, several studies indicate that exogenous ahr ligands can reduce tumor growth or invasion  <cit> . as elegantly described in a recent review  <cit> , these seemingly contradictory results may, in part, reflect context- or tumor stage-specific differences. for example, ahr agonists may inhibit growth in er+ breast cancers in part through ahr-mediated down-regulation of er expression or activity  <cit> . however, in similar cell types  <cit> , similar ahr agonist- and antagonist-mediated outcomes could be due to more subtle effects on ahr activation or signaling. for instance, it has been postulated that, while endogenous ahr ligands drive signaling towards, for example, increased invasion, exogenous ahr ligands ‘divert’  <cit>  or ‘disrupt’  <cit>  the response towards signaling pathways which oppose tumor invasion, e.g. differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, exogenous ligands, e.g. tranilast, that decrease invasion  <cit> , may act as partial agonists that compete with endogenous ligands for ahr binding but which are weaker activators of ahr transcriptional activity, thereby reducing baseline ahr signaling  <cit> . finally, outcomes may be ligand-, cell subset-, or dose-specific. thus, high affinity ahr ligands, such as tcdd, induce stem cell characteristics including aldh expression and accelerated migration, particularly at low doses , while higher doses  may reduce invasiveness of the majority non-bcslc population  <cit> .

finally, a limited number of previous studies have addressed the role of the ahr in breast cancer stem cell generation  <cit> . while these studies all point towards a role for the ahr in cancer stem-like cell generation, there is as yet no clear consensus on how this occurs or even on whether the ahr favors or inhibits bcslc production/function. for example, zhao et al.  <cit>  showed that ahr activation with β-nf or 3-mc or over-expression of a pasb mutant ahr decreased tumorsphere formation; in our hands, only 3-mc reduced secondary tumorsphere formation in sum <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells . in what may seem like a contradiction, zhao et al.  <cit>  later published that mcf- <dig> mammosphere formation was suppressed by ahr inhibition with ch <dig> as well as by sirna-mediated ahr knockdown in mda-mb- <dig> cells. in dubrovska et al.  <cit> , ahr inhibitors reduced the percentage of aldhhigh mcf- <dig> cells in tamoxifen-resistant mcf- <dig>  but produced the opposite effect in wildtype mcf- <dig> cells. at least some of these differences can be attributed to the different subtypes of breast cancer cells . in any case, further experimentation is required to determine how the ahr influences ‘stem-ness’ in breast cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS
studies presented here indicate that the ahr influences, in tnbc and ibc cells, critical markers associated with ‘stem-ness’. the ability of several exogenous ahr ligands, including tcdd and dmba to up-regulate phenotypic, genomic, and/or functional markers of bcslcs strongly suggests the potential for ubiquitous environmental ahr ligands to accelerate progression to lethal, invasive cancers. furthermore, the demonstration that ahr inhibition significantly reduces expression of these phenotypic and functional cancer stem cell markers encourages the testing of ahr inhibitors, for example, to significantly increase the sensitivity of bcslcs to conventional chemotherapeutics. in general, these results suggest that non-toxic ahr modulators may represent important therapeutics for otherwise refractory tnbc and ibc, and potentially for brain and other cancers in which the ahr appears to play a role.
