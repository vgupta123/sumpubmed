BACKGROUND
bifidobacterium longum is an obligate anaerobe, belonging to the actinomycetales, a branch of the high-gc gram-positive bacteria which includes, among others, corynebacteria, mycobacteria and streptomycetes. b. longum is a natural colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract  and the vagina  <cit> . it is one of the very first bacteria which colonize the sterile git of newborns, predominating in breast-fed infants until weaning  <cit> . thereafter, its numerical importance decreases, while bacteroides and other taxa replace it  <cit> . b. longum, a harmless bacterium, considered to play an important role in maintaining a healthy git by preventing diarrhea, improving lactose intolerance, and participating to immunomodulation  <cit> , is now widely used in health-promoting foods.

recently, the whole genome of b. longum strain ncc <dig> has been sequenced  <cit> . comparison with other high-gc gram-positives revealed high levels of protein homology with streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> , mycobacterium tuberculosis  and, to a lesser extent, with other actinobacteria as well as with some unrelated genera such as clostridium and streptococcus. surprisingly, it contains a very high number of genetic entities related to mobile elements such as transposons and plasmids. there are  <dig> integrases/recombinases,  <dig> intact insertion sequences , many remnants of iss, one integrated plasmid, many possible remnants of integrated plasmids and prophages. the origin and the terminus of chromosome replication of b. longum ncc <dig> could not be accurately localized along the initial whole genome sequence. today, djo10a, another strain of b. longum, is almost fully sequenced, but not assembled.

the presence of many iss and is remnants in b. longum ncc <dig> leaves open the possibility of major chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . these internal recombination events were already advanced to explain the poor conservation of gene order during the evolution of prokaryotic genomes  <cit> .

it appears that major chromosomal rearrangements almost always consist in inversions of a segment of the chromosome centered on the origin of replication  <cit> . other inversions are probably counter-selected  <cit> , since, unlike inversions around the origin of replication, they change the orientation of transcription relative to dna replication or they change the length of chromosome arms. such events have adverse effects on both replication speed and transcription  <cit> . alternatively, it has been proposed that rearrangements preferentially centered on the origin of replication are favored by the bidirectional dna replication: starting simultaneously from the origin of chromosome replication, the two replication forks are at the same distance from it and are likely to be in close contact  <cit> . thus, dna breaks produced by topoisomerases would generate structures suitable for recombinations between the two chromosomal arms, leading to origin-centered rearrangements  <cit> .

the coorientation between gene transcription and dna replication is apparently a fundamental feature of bacterial chromosome architecture. more specifically, orfs and trna genes follow a similar tendency and all so far identified ribosomal rna operons are cooriented with dna replication  <cit> . the asymmetric bias in the nucleotide composition at the genome level is another relevant feature . the leading strand, defined by chromosome replication, is generally enriched in guanines  and depleted in cytosines . to explain this observation several proposals have been advanced:  a preferential usage of certain codons to avoid frameshifting during translation  <cit> ,  the enrichment of coding sequences in purines so as to avoid mrnas secondary structures  <cit> ,  mutational biases targeting single-stranded dna present during transcription  <cit>  or  during dna replication  <cit> . mechanisms that would lead to the observed biases in models  to  rest on the widespread coorientation of gene transcription and chromosome replication . these asymmetric biases have allowed to unambiguously determine the origin of replication in almost all bacteria  <cit>  as well as the terminus of replication in a large majority of the species  <cit> .

genomic rearrangements are often highlighted by comparison of whole chromosomal sequences belonging to the same species or genus. for example, dot-plot analyses revealed two recombination events in streptococcus pyogenes ssi- <dig>  with respect to other s. pyogenes strains, leading to an inversion around the origin of replication  <cit> . since they do not change the orientation of transcription relative to dna replication, these symmetric rearrangement were not revealed by nucleotide bias  analysis.

however, several examples of asymmetric rearrangements are known, pointed out by nucleotide skew analyses. several isolates of the original clone of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  a high-gc gamma-proteobacterium and an opportunistic pathogen, have an inversion of a third of their chromosome. the inversion occurs by homologous recombination between two rrna loci: rrna and rrnb. as a consequence, the circular chromosome is divided into two inequal arms of one and two thirds, instead of the usual two halves  <cit> . this asymmetry is obvious on a cumulative gc- or ta skew curve . the citrus pathogen xylella fastidiosa 9a5c is another example of asymmetric rearrangements, that is highlighted when compared with another x. fastidiosa strain, temecula <dig>  <cit> . in this case, the rearrangements occur between three pairs of prophage-related elements  <cit> , also dividing the chromosome of strain 9a5c in two arms of inequal lenghts , as in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> . in yersinia pestis strains, the high number of insertion sequence  copies leads to frequent recombination events, inverting segments of the chromosome and changing their orientation of transcription with respect to replication. these inversions are easily spotted on a gc skew plot . in all three above cases, the rearrangements occur naturally, and do not constitute an incorrect genome assembly.

in this contribution we assess the assembly of the initially deposited genome sequence of b. longum ncc <dig> by genometric methods, rapid and efficient tools suitable for testing the assembly of prokaryotic chromosomes  <cit> . our analysis, strongly suggesting that the chromosome of b. longum ncc <dig> was initially misassembled, was confirmed by schell et al.  <cit>  during the review of this contribution.

RESULTS
analysis of the initial bifidobacterium longum ncc <dig> genome sequence
investigation with genometric tools of the initially released nucleotide sequence of b. longum ncc <dig>  revealed several atypical features.

first, cumulative gc skew on the first codon position, as well as the cumulative orf orientation skew, yielded a curve with six significant changes of the slope sign. furthermore, the dnaa gene was not located at the lowest minimum of the curve . this is clearly different from all known high-gc gram-positives , since they essentially exhibit one maximum and one minimum, the latter being generally located in the vicinity of the dnaa gene  <cit> .

the presence of dnaa at a place other than the minimum of the cumulative orf orientation curve has never been reported in high-gc gram-positive bacteria. for a large majority of bacterial species, it was shown that dnaa, a gene whose product binds to the origin of replication and participates in the initiation of replication, is located close to the origin  <cit> . more generally, in archaea, gene orc1/cdc <dig>  which encodes the archaeal counterpart of dnaa, is very often also located close to the origin of chromosome replication. finally, in sequenced genomes, half of archaea and most of bacterial genes encoding origin binding proteins are close to the minimum of the cumulative gc skew and orf orientation curves  <cit> .

second, in the first published b. longum ncc <dig> sequence, coorientation indexes , i.e. the proportion of genes or of a given subset of genes that are transcribed in the direction of chromosome replication, revealed significant anomalies. indeed, the ci of protein encoding genes and trnas was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while only one out of the four rrna operons was cooriented . these low cis are most uncommon in bacteria where it has been shown that the majority of protein encoding genes  <cit>  as well as of trna genes are cooriented with chromosome replication , while, so far, a strict coorientation of rrna operons constitutes a universal rule in prokaryotes  <cit> . more specifically, cis of protein encoding genes of m. tuberculosis cdc <dig> and s. coelicolor a <dig>  two high g+c gram-positives related to b. longum ncc <dig>  are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. cis of trnas of the same species are similar, i.e.  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, whereas all rrna operons are cooriented .

third, between-species whole-genome alignments of b. longum ncc <dig> and m. tuberculosis cdc <dig> or s. coelicolor a <dig> revealed a very poor conservation of gene order   <cit> . indeed, correlation coefficients measuring the conservation of gene order between species are close to zero, whereas in the ideal case the coefficient of correlation should be  <dig> and - <dig> for the direct and respectively indirect homologous dna segment subsets.

in summary, genometric analyses revealed major anomalies in the organization of the b. longum ncc <dig> genome:  several changes in the sign of the slope of the cumulative nucleotide skew curves, and location of the dnaa gene far from the minimum of the curve,  low gene coorientation indexes and  absence of correlation between b. longum ncc <dig> and related species in between-species whole-genome alignments.

relationship of b. longum strains ncc <dig> and djo10a
availability of numerous contigs of the genome of djo10a, another b. longum strain, strongly suggested that the initially reported sequence of ncc <dig> chromosome could have been incorrectly assembled, or had undergone major chromosomal rearrangements. indeed, blast results reveal three djo10a long scaffolds -number  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> – each with a large number of hits in two different regions of the b. longum ncc <dig> chromosome . these homology discontinuities occur in four regions encompassing extrema of the cumulative skew curves . within each of these four regions, an insertion sequence was identified: isblo2a and isblo2b, belonging to the is <dig> family, and isblo5c and isblo5d, belonging to the is <dig> family  <cit> .

the presence of these insertion sequences  at putative recombination sites offers a straightforward way to account for chromosomal rearrangements which can mediate the shift between initial configuration of strain ncc <dig> and the putative configuration of strain djo10a, here below designated configurations i and ii, respectively . indeed, translocation and inversion of the two large segments a and d, achieved by two homologous recombination events between isblo2a and 2b, on one side, and isblo5c and 5d, on the other side, would allow the interconversion between configurations i and ii. this assumption is supported by the cross-exchange of direct repeats in both is pairs, as noted in the is finder database  <cit> .

analysis of the configuration ii of the b. longum ncc <dig> chromosome
genometric analyses of the b. longum ncc <dig> chromosome in configuration ii reveal a genome architecture typical of high-gc gram-positive organisms. indeed, the cumulative gc-skew curve performed on the first codon positions and the cumulative orf orientation skew curves are very similar to those characteristic of high-gc gram-positive chromosomes . first, both skew curves exhibit essentially one minimum and one maximum corresponding, respectively, to the origin and the terminus of chromosome replication; dnaa being at the minimum of the curve while the integrated plasmid is close to the probable terminus of replication, at the maximum of the skew curves. the two minor peaks correspond to the extremities of the integrated plasmid. this genetic element is antioriented, so that the majority of its genes are transcribed in the opposite direction with respect to chromosome replication, leading to a short reversal both in the cumulative orf orientation skew and the cumulative first codon gc skew curves. this fact was already reported for other integrated elements  and is possibly a consequence of the instability of the integration. integration of foreign dna stretches close to the terminus is common, for example in prophages  <cit> . a higher frequency of recombination at the terminus of replication was proposed as the source of this instability  <cit> . it appears that of the six changes in the sign of the skew slopes of strain ncc <dig> in configuration i, one does actually correspond to the origin of chromosome replication and a recombination site, three to other recombination sites, one to the likely terminus of replication, and the last one to the distal extremity of an integrated plasmid. second, in configuration ii, the cis of protein encoding- and trna genes are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, while all rrna operons are cooriented, a situation characteristic of prokaryotes . third, between-species whole-genome alignments of b. longum in configuration ii and s. coelicolor a <dig> or m. tuberculosis cdc <dig> display a fair conservation of gene order . correlation coefficients of type ii regressions for direct and indirect homologous dna segment subsets are much closer to  <dig> or - <dig>  respectively, than those obtained with the sequence of b. longum ncc <dig> in configuration i . finally, each of the scaffolds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of b. longum djo10a has hits in one single region of the b. longum ncc <dig> chromosome in configuration ii .

a genome sequence corresponding approximatively to configuration ii of b. longum ncc <dig>  has been recently deposited in the genbank database by schell et al.  <cit> . whereas we hypothesized that the two pairs of is, isblo2a, isblo2b, isblo5c and isblo5d were the only four chromosomal rearrangement loci, these authors found experimental evidences that, moreover, the initial sequence of ncc <dig> had been misassembled at the level of the three ribosomal rna operons. the sequence in configuration ii proposed in this contribution has three dna segments  which are differently assembled than the corrected sequence. these assembly discrepancies have only very limited consequences on the results of our analyses.

thus, configuration ii, similar to the recently deposited sequence of the b. longum ncc <dig> genome , is endowed with all chromosomal features common to high-gc gram-positive bacteria:  cumulative gc-and orf orientation skew curves are typical and the dnaa gene is located at the minimum of the curves,  between-species whole-genome alignments provide the expected x-shape and the coefficients of correlation are relatively close to  <dig> or - <dig> and  relevant contigs of b. longum djo10a are each homologous to a single continuous region of the proposed ncc <dig> chromosome.

CONCLUSIONS
genometric analyses – nucleotide skews, coorientation indexes, blast comparisons and between-species whole-genome alignments – revealed a most peculiar chromosomal architecture of the initially reported sequence of the b. longum ncc <dig> genome. this observation may have two explanations.

first, it is highly probable that in the final stages of the sequencing process, the genome of b. longum ncc <dig> was misassembled, a possibility presently favored by schell and coworkers, in particular since independently performed long-range pcr experiments confirm the presence of configuration ii, but could not detect configuration i . this is in full agreement with genometric analyses of more than  <dig> genome sequences  which reveal a near universal architecture of prokaryotic chromosomes, also found in configuration ii of b. longum ncc <dig> 

second, the genome of ncc <dig> may possibly undergo major chromosomal rearrangements, yielding either of the two alternative configurations i and ii. the interconversion between them, achieved by two crossovers between two pairs of homologous insertion sequences , would have drastic consequences. in particular, in configuration ii, the cooriented transcription of the majority of the genes, including all rrna operons, with chromosome replication would allow higher growth rates in suitable conditions. absence of significant coorientation in configuration i due to the inversion of large segments b and d, representing about 50% of the chromosome, would probably considerably increase the generation time because of collisions between the dna- and the rna polymerase  <cit> . however, as discussed here above, the adverse effects of inversions, other than those around the origin of replication, would render the existence of configuration i highly unlikely. actually, the latter has apparently not been detected in long range pcr experiments . however, inversions of relatively long segments – leading to the antiorientation of the majority of the genes in the segment – have been reported, for example, in yersinia pestis  <cit> , and thus may not be completely excluded in b. longum ncc <dig> 

for the first time, our analyses illustrate the potential of fast and straightforward genometric methods to test genome assembly. they almost immediately revealed gross anomalies of the b. longum ncc <dig> initially published sequence, pointing to an incorrect assembling. in conclusion, although their results have to be supported by experimental verification, these simple and powerful tools are essential for the assembly of a chromosome sequence, and for its final validation.
