BACKGROUND
bioethanol derived from cellulosic biomass may constitute an environmentally-friendly replacement for fossil fuel in the future  <cit> . several kinds of bioprocesses have been proposed for the conversion of biomass into cellulosic ethanol such as separate hydrolysis and fermentation , simultaneous saccharification and fermentation , simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation , and consolidated bioprocessing . among these, cbp seems to be the most promising because of its potential high efficiency and low cost  <cit> . to achieve cbp, a microbe that is capable of producing secretory cellulases is needed to digest cellulose into a suitable carbon source to produce ethanol by fermentation.

saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most widely-used microorganism for fermentation because of its high ethanol conversion rate. over the past decade, a number of cellulases have been discovered from animal guts, forest fungi and plants, some of which were successfully expressed in pichia pastoris <cit> . several patented or commercial extracellular cellulases were derived from trichoderma species  <cit> . however, to establish a cbp platform using s. cerevisiae, the host needs to be modified to express and secrete recombinant cellulases more efficiently  <cit> .

post-translational modifications in s. cerevisiae affect the functions of recombinant proteins. for example, n-glycosylation in yeast is of the high-mannose type  <cit>  and such n-glycosylation of a recombinant cellulase was found to reduce its activity and enhance its non-productive binding on cellulose  <cit> . on the other hand, trichoderma reesei benefits from overexpression of a s. cerevisiae glycosylation gene  to increase its own cellulase activity  <cit> . therefore, understanding how glycosylation affects the properties of foreign proteins in yeast cells is helpful for the development of s. cerevisiae as a production host for heterologous proteins.

one way to achieve cbp is to express and secrete all of the three essential cellulases, namely endocellulase, exocellulase and beta-glucosidase, by s. cerevisiae for direct digestion of cellulosic materials  <cit> . exocellulase is often considered the rate-limiting enzyme during cellulosic degradation. the importance of the exocellulase activity has been demonstrated in several studies  <cit> . it has been reported that a white-rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium showed more cellulase production and higher activities than three trichoderma spp. in agricultural waste  <cit> . unlike t. reesei, p. chrysosporium produces more different types of cbhi-like cellobiohydrolases  <cit> , and secretes many exocellulases, especially the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  exocellulases during cellulosic degradation. omics approaches  <cit>  and functional studies  <cit>  have shown that many potential cellulases exist in this white-rot fungus. from the genome sequence of p. chrysosporium, we selected several putative gh <dig> genes  <cit>  for expression in s. cerevisiae. we found that instead of secreting the recombinant cellulase into the extracellular space, most of the transformants accumulate the heterologous cellulase inside the cells. after activity screening, we chose the gh <dig> gene with the highest exocellulase activity, designated as pcx, for further investigation.

several studies have shown that it is possible to improve the secretion efficiency of recombinant proteins expressed in yeast by manipulating the cellular protein trafficking and glycosylation pathways . to examine the effects of changes in glycosylation- and protein trafficking-associated genes on extracellular pcx activity, we transformed the pcx cdna into yeast knockout  strains of  <dig> glycosylation-related and  <dig> protein trafficking-associated genes to screen for those with increased cellulase activity. our results showed that knockouts of two glycosylation-related genes  and one golgi-to-endosome transport gene  increased extracellular exocellulase activity up to  <dig> to  <dig> fold. for comparison, we also expressed four cellulase genes from three other fungi, an endocellulase  and an exocellulase  from t. ressei, an endocellulase  from irpex lacteus, and a beta-glucosidase  from aspergillus niger in s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
low level of secretion of recombinant cellulases in s. cerevisiae
exocellulase pcx from p. chrysosporium, endocellulase egiii and exocellulase cbhi from t. ressei, and endocellulase cen <dig> from i. lacteus were all successfully expressed in s. cerevisiae by <dig> strain. however, when the alpha factor signal peptide was used as the secretion signal, none of these heterologously expressed cellulases could be secreted from yeast cells. lower cellulase activity was observed in protein extracted from the supernatant of the cell culture than in protein extracted from cell pellets . it has been suggested that over-glycosylation reduces the activity of recombinant cellulases and may also reduce their secretion ability in yeast  <cit> . moreover, the golgi-to-endosome transportation pathway may also interfere in protein exocytosis because the golgi-endoplasmic reticulum system is responsible for the degradation and detoxification of heterologous proteins  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether mutations in the glycosylation pathway or in the golgi-to-endosome trafficking pathway affected the secretion of heterologous proteins or their cellulase activity.

deglycosylation increases extracellular pcx cellulase activity
a survey of s. cerevisiae by <dig> gene knockout collections  identified more than  <dig> viable strains with knockout mutations in genes related to glycosylation and protein trafficking. we successfully transformed the pcx coding sequence into  <dig> single-gene-knockout strains; the  <dig> genes included  <dig> glycosylation-related genes, including those from the major alg, ost, mnn, pmt gene families, and  <dig> trafficking-associated genes involved in golgi-to-endosome-vacuole transport . we then used the 96-well plate screening method to test candidate transformants for increased total extracellular cellulase activities using the 4-methylumbellifery-Î²-d-cellobioside  assay . the extracellular pcx activities of  <dig> of the  <dig> glycosylation-related gene knockout strains and all except one of the golgi-to-endosome transport pathway mutants increased at least  <dig> -fold relative to expression in the wild-type strain. to ensure that the screening results were reliable, we further condensed the supernatants from 50-ml cell culture and reanalyzed their activities. interestingly, the extracellular pcx cellulase expressed in the glycosylation-related mnn <dig> and pmt <dig> null mutants showed  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increases in cellulase activity, respectively, compared to expression in the wild-type strain . we also tested the npabgs beta-glucosidase isolated from the neocallimastix patriciarum w <dig> strain  <cit>  with  <dig> of the  <dig> single-gene-knockout by <dig> strains and obtained similar results .

the 4-muc activity ratio is the average pcx activity of the three highest expressing recombinants  to the average original pcx activity .

our 4-muc analyses also showed an increase in extracellular pcx activity in the alg and ost null mutants . it is known that the alg and ost family genes play roles in the initiation of the addition of n-glycans to proteins and the elongation of mannose in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . alg <dig>  alg <dig>  alg <dig>  die <dig>  ost <dig> and ost <dig> are downstream glycosylation pathway genes responsible for n-mannose and n-glucose elongation. extracellular pcx activity was also increased in mnn and pmt mutants. in the golgi, mnn family proteins add n-mannose to complete n-linked glycosylation, while the pmt family genes encode enzymes elongating oligomannoses for assembling o-glycosylation  <cit> . a previous study indicated that the disruption of the mnn <dig> gene enhanced protein secretion in yeast  <cit> . our 4-muc analysis also showed increases in extracellular pcx activity in mnn <dig>  mnn <dig>  mnn <dig>  mnn <dig> and mnn <dig> null mutants . these genes are also downstream glycosylation pathway genes responsible for high n-mannose glycosylation . extracellular pcx activity was also increased in the pmt <dig>  pmt <dig>  pmt <dig> and pmt <dig> null mutants. previous studies have also suggested that mutations in mnn and pmt can increase endocellulase production in s. cerevisiae <cit> . in summary, these results suggest that knocking out o- and n-glycosylation-related genes can indeed increase the total cellulase activity of recombinant extracellular cellulase pcx.

blocking golgi-to-endosome transport increases extracellular pcx cellulase activity
in yeast cells, heterologously expressed proteins are often transported to endosomes for degradation via vps family proteins and others  <cit> . our results showed that extracellular pcx activity was increased  in  <dig> of the  <dig> golgi-to-endosome-related gene knockout mutants, especially in the chc <dig>  clc <dig> and vps <dig> null mutants . the supernatants from 50-ml cell culture were condensed and re-analyzed for their activities. the vps <dig> null mutant had the highest extracellular pcx cellulase activity,  <dig>  times higher than that of the parental strain. chc1p and clc1p are subunits of the clathrin protein and can form clathrin-coated vesicles for intracellular protein transport, while vps21p is a part of the corvet complex required for vesicle transport between the vacuole and endosome . a recent study also found that inhibition of vesicle sorting to vacuoles could increase endocellulase production in s. cerevisiae <cit> . these results imply that blocking the endocytosis pathway can indirectly influence s. cerevisiae to export pcx through the vesicle exocytosis pathway. however, total extracellular proteins only increased slightly in the vps <dig> null mutant . therefore, other unknown factors may influence the extracellular pcx activity.

multiple-gene-knockout strains do not show further improvement in pcx activity and secretion
next, we constructed double gene knockout strains of mnn <dig>  pmt <dig> and vps <dig> to examine whether a combination of mutations would further increase the cellulase activity and secretion of the pcx enzyme. the generation times of the single- and double-gene knockout strains were shorter than that of the parental by <dig> strain . among these strains, the highest extracellular pcx activity was recorded after incubation for 24Â hours . in addition, the growth rate of each mutant might be less important for extracellular pcx activity. for example, the vps <dig> null mutant had higher enzyme activity than the pmt <dig> null mutant even though the pmt <dig> null mutant had a shorter doubling time and higher saturation od <dig> . thus, in further analyses we compared the secreted pcx activity in single- and double-gene-knockout strains in 24-hour cultures .

the data showed that the mnn <dig> and vps <dig> null mutants had a higher extracellular pcx activity than those of the double-gene knockout mutants. a previous study  <cit>  reported that the mnn <dig> protein elongated n-glycan by adding mannose to the recombinant proteins and could reduce the heterologous protein activity in yeast. in contrast, figureÂ  <dig> shows that lack of the mnn <dig> gene  could increase the total activity of extracellular pcx and the secretion of extracellular proteins. we only found significantly more total extracellular protein abundance in the mnn <dig> null mutant but not in the other mutants examined, so we suggest that yeast lacking the mnn <dig> gene is suitable to raise the yield of a heterologous protein expressed in a s. cerevisiae host system . second, pmt5p functions in the addition of o-linked glycans to amino acids. our results consistently showed that the pmt <dig> mutation, which might result in less o-glycosylation, could also increase the total activity of extracellular pcx. extracellular protein secretion did not increase significantly in the pmt <dig> null mutant, but the total cellulase activity still increased, suggesting that a reduction in o-glycosylation increases cellulase activity but may not affect protein secretion. third, vps <dig> is a key player in golgi-to-vacuole transport. our results showed that the total extracellular pcx activity was also increased in yeast that lacks vps <dig> protein. among the double gene knockout strains, the mnn10âvps21â knockout strain had very slow growth to produce pcx protein. this double-gene knockout mutant might down-regulate protein secretion, extracellular pcx activity, or cell growth. therefore, such mutants are probably not suitable for application in cellulosic ethanol production. furthermore, the pmt5âvps21â or mnn10âpmt5â knockout strains increased the total extracellular cellulase activity but also showed slower growth rates than single-gene knockout strains. these results suggest that the increase in extracellular cellulase activity in the mnn <dig> null mutant is mainly due to an increase in cellulase protein secretion, not due to protein activity itself, whereas the increase in pmt <dig> and vps <dig> null mutants may be mainly due to protein post-translational modifications and/or disordered intracellular trafficking. together, these results suggest that single-gene knockout strains may be more suitable for bioethanol applications.

protein modification differences among recombinant cellulases in null mutants
an increase in extracellular cellulase activity results from changes in glycosylation and/or extracellular secretion. pcx has three potential n-glycosylation sites in the catalytic domain and five putative o-glycosylation sites in the cellulose-binding domain. to assess the effect of glycosylation on extracellular pcx activity, we compared the effects of abolishing gene function at earlier and later steps in the glycosylation pathway. we introduced the pcx gene into the alg1- <dig> mutant  which contains defects in asparagine-linked glycosylation  <cit> . the alg <dig> gene functions in elongating n-glycan after the formation of the first three glycans  at the n-glycosylation site of a protein . the purified pcx in the alg1- <dig> mutant showed a significant shift in molecular weight, while the remaining null mutants  had slightly different sds-page mobility patterns, except vps21â::kanmx . however, the pcx activity in the alg1- <dig> mutant was even lower than that in the knockout strains implying that the modified glycans still played an important role in pcx activity . furthermore, the mnn <dig> mutant had the highest level of extracellular protein secretion among the knockout strains. a previous study suggested that disruption of the mnn <dig> gene increases protein secretion in yeasts due to the change in the structure of glycoproteins in the yeast cell wall which affects the release of secretory proteins into the media at the last stage of protein secretion  <cit> . however, the mnn <dig> gene may be essential to increase yeast tolerance of ethanol-induced stress  <cit> .

we also found that the pmt <dig> null mutant, which encodes an o-mannosyltransferase, resulted in an increase in extracellular pcx activity . the pmt family proteins manage o-glycosylation as a sorting determinant for cell surface delivery  <cit> , and protein o-glycosylation is essential for cell wall rigidity and cell integrity as well as protein modification in s. cerevisiae and t. reesei <cit> . herein, our results point to the possibility that the pmt <dig> mutant might increase the extracellular pcx activity and therefore might also play a role in the protein secretory process.

n-glycosyation site-mutagenesis influences the activity of a recombinant cellulase
we next conducted site-directed mutagenesis of putative n-glycosylation sites of pcx to examine their possible effects on the extracellular pcx activity . peptide-n-glycosidase f  can cleave high mannose and complex oligosaccharides from n-linked glycoproteins. the deglycosylated pcx proteins treated with pngasef  only showed a statistically significant difference in 4-muc activity between the vps <dig> null mutant and the wild-type by4741; the previous two strains added more n-glycans to the expressed pcx than the other two null mutants  tested. these results suggest that mutations of the o- or n-glycosylation sites may influence the extracellular pcx activity.

protein modeling of cellobiohydrolase  <dig> based on x-ray data  revealed that the n <dig> site is located near the cellulose-binding tunnel and the other two sites  are located on the pcx protein surface . n-glycosylation may thus interfere with substrate binding to pcx or conformation structure and influence pcx activity. therefore, we replaced the three potential n-glycosylation amino acid sites  of pcx with aspartate  or glutamine . these mutated pcx genes were transformed into yeast to determine their effects on extracellular pcx cellulases. the extracellular activities of all the mutated pcx cellulases, except the n442d mutant, were lower than those of the wild-type pcx cellulase . the n442q mutant showed significantly lower extracellular pcx activity. the total and specific extracellular activities in the n442d mutant, however, were higher than those in wild-type pcx. these results suggest that the individual mutations on the pcx gene also affect pcx activity.

we also extracted the intracellular soluble proteins from cell pellets to evaluate the secretary efficiencies of the six mutants - n208d, n208q, n326d, n326q, n442d, n442q . the pcx extracellular and intracellular soluble protein activities of the n208d, n326d, and n442q mutants were much lower than the other mutants. the n442q mutant showed the most significant reduction in extracellular and intracellular activities. in contrast, the n208q and n442d mutants showed higher intracellular and higher extracellular activity than wild-type pcx . furthermore, when the mutated pcx gene was manipulated into the mnn <dig>  pmt <dig>  and vps <dig> null mutants, the extracellular activities in the three mutants were still higher than the wide-type strain as in figureÂ  <dig> . thus, the three mutants are indeed suitable hosts for extracellular pcx protein production. in short, the combination of n442d site-mutated pcx protein in vps <dig> null mutants may exhibit the highest extracellular pcx activity.

comparison of null mutants that enhance different cellulase protein production in s. cerevisiae
our study complements two recent studies  <cit> . kitagawa et al.  reported 55âs. cerevisiae knockout strains that exhibited enhanced ctcel8a endocellulase activity. the vps3â and vps16â strains, which have deletions in genes encoding components of the class c core vacuole/endosome tethering  complex, also exhibited enhanced beta-glucosidase activity of ctcel8a proteins. both vps3p and vps21p are major components of the same corvet complex. thus, inhibition of the endocytosis pathway indeed could improve heterologous cellulase production. in a second study, suzuki et al.  screened for enhancement of the endocellulase cel8aenz using  <dig> protein glycosylation mutants. the mutations in alg, pmt and mnn family genes also improved the cel8aenz production in s. cerevisiae. these results and our results shown in tableÂ  <dig> indicate that mutations such as mnn9â, ost4â, ost6â that cause reduction of n-glycosylation abilities of the yeast host can increase the heterologous celluase activities. furthermore, o-glycosylation deficiency, such as seen in the pmt1â, pmt2â, pmt5â mutants, could also improve heterologous cellulase production.

our screening method  could quantify and sensitively detect the total activity of exoglucanase easily, while the plate method  <cit>  was not sensitive enough to apply in exoglucanse screening. the systemic analyses using the yeast deletion strain collection allowed us to identify genes that, when mutated, could increase the efficiency of cellulase production.

CONCLUSIONS
systematic screening and analysis revealed that some s. cerevisiae glycosylation and protein-trafficking pathway gene-knockout mutants improve extracellular cellulase activity and undergo functional changes during heterologous protein synthesis in yeast. it is known that n-glycosylation in yeast is of the high-mannose type and that increased n-glycosylation of recombinant cellulases reduces their activity  <cit> . our screening of gene-knockout mutants of the glycosylation pathway showed that the activity of recombinant pcx cellulase increased significantly in some mannose-glycosylation gene knockout strains such as mnn <dig>  mnn <dig>  mnn <dig> and mnt <dig>  heterologous pcx cellulase activity was affected by not only the high-mannose glycosylation pattern, but also the activity of intracellular trafficking systems of s. cerevisiae. systematic screening of knockouts of intracellular trafficking-associated genes showed that the activity of extracellular pcx cellulase increased significantly when some intracellular trafficking-associated genes such as chc <dig>  clc <dig>  and vps <dig> were inactivated. o-glycosylation associated genes, such as pmt <dig>  pmt <dig> and pmt <dig>  which are involved in post-translational modification of the endoplasmic reticulum, also influenced the cell wall rigidity for the secretion of the pcx cellulase protein, potentially posing an obstacle to the efficient use of s. cerevisiae as host in a consolidated bioethanol production system. our systematic gene knockout screening approach has proven to be useful to test the secretion capability and cellulase activity of proteins heterologously expressed in s. cerevisiae. in the future, this approach can be further modified as an automatic high-throughput platform to speed up the screening process to find s. cerevisiae mutant strains that may be suitable for use in bioprocessing.
