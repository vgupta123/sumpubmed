BACKGROUND
non-typhoidal salmonella are one of the leading causes of bacterial foodborne disease in the united states, accounting for over a million human cases each year  <cit> . salmonellosis symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps that occur  <dig> to 72 hours after infection. annually, salmonella is responsible for an estimated  <dig>  hospitalizations and nearly  <dig> deaths in the united states, with a financial burden of approximately $ <dig>  –  <dig>  billion  <cit> . most infections are transmitted via ingestion of contaminated food and, unlike trends with other bacterial foodborne pathogens, the annual incidence rate of salmonellosis has not significantly declined over the past decade. since  <dig>  nearly a fifth of all salmonellosis cases in the united states were caused by salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars typhimurium  and heidelberg   <cit> . according to the centers for disease control and prevention, there have already been two outbreaks in  <dig> where s. typhimurium and s. heidelberg were responsible  <cit> .

to limit and reduce the scope of a salmonella outbreak, an efficient and robust surveillance system is vital. during epidemiological investigations salmonella isolates are serotyped and concurrently subtyped to classify isolates to the strain level. an ideal subtyping method has a high discriminatory power  but is not so discriminatory that it inadvertently separates isolates that are part of the same outbreak . there are several molecular-based subtyping approaches that have been developed, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis   <cit> , multiple amplification of prophage locus typing   <cit>  and, most recently, a multiplex dna suspension array  <cit> . pfge was adapted to salmonella in the 1990s and generally provides a high discriminatory power for subtyping most salmonella serovars, though it certainly does not provide equal sensitivity across all serovars  <cit> . despite being labor-intensive and time-consuming, conventional serotyping and concurrent pfge fingerprinting is still considered the gold standard for salmonella subtyping and is widely used by public health surveillance laboratories  <cit> . although pfge data are uploaded to pulsenet usa , the national electronic network for food disease surveillance that is coordinated by the cdc, inter-laboratory comparisons of pfge fingerprints can be ambiguous.

there are several different pfge patterns, or pulsotypes, though most often a limited number of common patterns are associated with the majority of isolates within a given serovar. two recent s. typhimurium and s. heidelberg foodborne outbreaks in the united states involved contaminated cantaloupe melons   <cit>  and broiled chicken livers   <cit> . in both cases, the individual xbai pfge patterns associated with each strain were fairly common: for s. typhimurium, the associated pfge pattern is typically seen in 10– <dig> cases per month  <cit>  and for s. heidelberg, the pattern occurs even more frequently, 30– <dig> cases per month  <cit> . consequently, identification of the outbreak strains was particularly difficult and to more accurately identify isolates that were part of the s. typhimurium cantaloupe outbreak, these isolates were also analyzed by mvla to define the outbreak strain. additionally, another s. heidelberg outbreak in  <dig>  linked to ground turkey, involved isolates with two similar but distinctly different pfge patterns, thus showing reduced epidemiologic concordance by this subtyping method  <cit> . this last example may indicate evolutionary relatedness between the two sets of isolates which, unlike some methods, pfge cannot really provide.

the recent outbreak cases described above highlight the need for additional subtyping approaches for salmonella that can be used instead of, or as a complement to pfge for routine disease surveillance and outbreak tracking. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  are found in ~50% of all bacterial species, including salmonella <cit> . crispr elements comprise several unique short sequences, called spacers, which are interspaced by conserved direct repeats. in some bacteria, homology between a spacer and a complementary target nucleic acid results in degradation of the target by sequence-specific endonucleases, providing protection from exogenous bacteriophage or plasmid dna [reviewed in  <cit> . due to both acquisition and loss of these spacer elements, crisprs represent arguably the most rapidly evolving prokaryotic loci  <cit> .

sequence analysis of crispr loci has been used to subtype clinical isolates of salmonella <cit> , escherichia coli <cit> , group a streptococcus <cit>  and campylobacter species  <cit> . salmonella contains two of these non-coding loci, which are comprised of direct repeats of  <dig> nucleotides separated by spacers of  <dig> nucleotides . generally, crispr polymorphisms between salmonella strains are due to deletion or repetition of one or more spacers, termed ‘spacer microevolution’  <cit> . an extensive investigation of  <dig> isolates, representing several different serovars, showed that polymorphisms within the crispr loci correlate highly with serovar, with isolates from individual serovars bearing distinct crispr patterns  <cit> .

we recently developed a sequence-based subtyping assay  for salmonella that involves the sequencing of two virulence genes, fimh <dig>  and ssel, in addition to crispr sequencing  <cit> . preliminary studies showed that this approach, termed crispr-mvlst, provided better discrimination than either crispr or mvlst alone and, importantly, exhibited strong epidemiologic concordance among eight out of nine of the most common illness-causing salmonella enterica serovars  <cit> , including both s. heidelberg and s. typhimurium outbreak strains. subsequently, among a large number of clinical isolates of the highly clonal s. enteritidis, a combination of crispr-mvlst and pfge was required to provide a sufficient discriminatory power  <cit> . among a large set of s. newport clinical isolates, crispr-mvlst provides similar discrimination to pfge  <cit> .

to further determine the functionality of this new subtyping approach, we investigated the discriminatory power of both crispr-mvlst and pfge among a larger and unbiased collection of clinical s. typhimurium and s. heidelberg isolates that were collected over a five year period. we show here that a combination of both crispr-mvlst and pfge is required to achieve an appropriate discriminatory power for s. heidelberg. for s. typhimurium, both subtyping methods independently provide a discriminatory power > <dig> . importantly, as one of the first applications of crispr-mvlst to analyze isolates that were part of an outbreak, we were able to cluster two different s. typhimurium outbreak strains.

RESULTS
results of crispr-mvlst
to more accurately determine the discriminatory power of crispr-mvlst and pfge for s. heidelberg and s. typhimurium, we subtyped  <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively, that were obtained from the pennsylvania department of health . among the  <dig> total isolates analyzed, we identified  <dig> crispr <dig> alleles,  <dig> crispr <dig> alleles,  <dig> fimh alleles and  <dig> ssel alleles . of these, we found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> alleles, respectively, that were novel and not seen in our previous data sets  <cit> . in total, these alleles defined  <dig> novel sequence types among the two serovars . the overwhelming sequence-type diversity among both of these prevalent serovars is provided by genetic variability in the crispr loci, rather than in either fimh or ssel . we found that 88/ <dig> s. heidelberg isolates had fimh allele  <dig> and in s. typhimurium there were two predominant fimh alleles, allele  <dig>  and allele  <dig> . similarly, in s. heidelberg, 88/ <dig> isolates bore ssel allele  <dig> and in s. typhimurium, 73/ <dig> isolates had ssel allele  <dig>  the polymorphisms between different ssel or fimh alleles arise from the presence of snps with the exception of allele  <dig> that has a single base insertion. no alleles for any of the four markers were shared among the two different serovars, consistent with previously published studies  <cit> .

s. heidelberg analysis and sequence type distribution
crispr-mvlst analysis of  <dig> s. heidelberg clinical isolates  resulted in  <dig> unique s. heidelberg sequence types , hst  <dig> – hst  <dig> . in total, we identified  <dig> crispr <dig> alleles,  <dig> crispr <dig> alleles,  <dig> fimh alleles and  <dig> ssel alleles . as shown in figure 2b, most of the allelic diversity comes from the crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> loci. all  <dig> crispr <dig> alleles and seven of the eight crispr <dig> alleles were new, compared to our previous studies  <cit> . we did not find any new fimh alleles in our dataset and only one of the two ssel alleles was new. the most frequent st was hst <dig>  occurring in 49/ <dig> isolates .

discriminatory power of crispr-mvlst and pfge in s. heidelberg isolates
the discriminatory power of crispr-mvlst among the s. heidelberg isolates was calculated to be  <dig>  . the discriminatory power provided by pfge among the same isolates was  <dig>  . given these low values and insufficient discriminatory power   <cit> , we combined the two typing methods. this combination provided  <dig> unique groups with a more satisfactory discriminatory power of  <dig>  , suggesting a 92% confidence in ability to separate unrelated isolates.

separation of common s. heidelberg subtypes
among the s. heidelberg isolates analyzed, the most frequent pfge pulsotype was jf6x <dig>  . we were able to further subtype isolates with jf6x <dig>  pattern into  <dig> distinct hsts - hst  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . among jf6x <dig>  isolates, the two most common hsts were hst <dig>  and hst <dig> . jf6x <dig>  is also fairly common, occurring in 8% of isolates studied. with these isolates, we were able to further subtype them into  <dig> distinct hsts – hst  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with hst <dig> being the most common . conversely, over half the isolates analyzed have hst  <dig> , but by pfge analysis, these are represented by  <dig> different pfge patterns, the most frequent being jf6x <dig>  . collectively, this data highlights the strengths and weakness of each subtyping method.

s. typhimurium analysis and sequence type distribution
crispr-mvlst analysis of  <dig> s. typhimurium clinical isolates  resulted in the identification of  <dig> unique and novel s. typhimurium sequence types , tst <dig> – tst <dig>  and tst <dig> – tst <dig> . this included  <dig> crispr <dig>   <dig> crispr <dig>   <dig> fimh and  <dig> ssel alleles . of these, the majority of crispr <dig> alleles were new  and all crispr <dig> alleles were new , as compared to our previous studies  <cit> . as with s. heidelberg, the majority of unique sequence types were defined by polymorphisms in either or both of the crispr loci .

discriminatory power of crispr-mvlst and pfge in s. typhimurium isolates
the discriminatory power of crispr-mvlst among the s. typhimurium isolates was  <dig>  . this means that there would be a 94% probability that two unrelated isolates could be separated using the crispr-mvlst scheme. similarly, for pfge, the discriminatory power among these isolates is  <dig>  . these values suggest that either method can provide sufficient discrimination between outbreak and non-outbreak s. typhimurium strains.

correlation between different tsts and pfge patterns
we next wanted to investigate whether any correlation existed between tsts and pfge patterns. to accomplish this, we first determined the relationship among different tsts. burst analysis of all  <dig> tsts generated four groups . of these, groups 1– <dig> contain  <dig> –  <dig> tsts. group  <dig> consists of only two tsts and burst was unable to assign a core tst. there was also a collection of five singletons that burst did not assign to a group. for groups 1– <dig>  each group comprises a core tst surrounded by tsts that differ from the core by one allele. the number of rings in the group demonstrates the number of allele differences from the core. for example, in group  <dig> tsts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> each differ by one allele at one locus from the core tst, tst  <dig>  for group  <dig>  tst  <dig> is the core tst and tsts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> each differ from tst  <dig> at one locus. tst  <dig>  in the outer ring differs from the tsts in the middle ring at one locus and from the core at two loci.

to investigate whether there was any relationship between crispr-mvlst sequence type and pfge patterns, we overlaid our pfge data to identify isolates from different tsts that have the same pfge pattern. figure 5a shows that there were seven pfge pulsotypes that could be further separated into tsts. in the majority of instances , identical pfge patterns were found in isolates that had closely related tsts such as jpxx <dig>  and jpxx <dig>  .

following this, we then generated a dendrogram using the dice coefficient to determine the relationship between different pfge pulsotypes. for clarity, we color-coded the pfge patterns according to the burst group shown in figure 5a. as can be seen in figure 5b, closely related crispr-mvlst sequence types have similar pfge patterns.

crispr-mvlst analysis of s. typhimurium outbreak isolates
since crispr-mvlst and pfge exhibit a similarly high discriminatory ability in s. typhimurium, we wanted to investigate the utility of the former for separating outbreak isolates. we obtained  <dig> s. typhimurium isolates from the pennsylvania department of health . ten of these were isolates associated with an outbreak in  <dig> with the cluster designation 0411pajpx-1c. all affected persons were on a bus trip together, though the outbreak source was never identified. the remaining  <dig> isolates comprised  <dig> isolates that were linked to a  <dig> live poultry outbreak  and  <dig> control isolates that were isolated in the same year but were not part of any classified outbreaks.

typhimurium isolates used in the outbreak study

the  <dig> isolates without cluster information represent the sporadic, or non-outbreak related, isolates used as controls in the study.

crispr-mvlst was able to separate the  <dig> isolates, with each isolate bearing the unique tst <dig> . these isolates were also analyzed by two-enzyme pfge, using xbai and blni. though they had the same tst, two of the isolates, 04e <dig> and 04e <dig> had different pfge patterns with blni or xbai, respectively, and are indicated in bold in table  <dig>  this example shows that crispr-mvlst provides an epidemiologic concordance of  <dig>  and for pfge it is less than  <dig> . additionally, the xbai pfge pattern associated with this strain, jpxx <dig> , occurred fairly frequently in our initial data set; 12/ <dig> isolates had this pulsotype and we were able to separate these into seven different tsts.

for the  <dig> outbreak isolates, crispr-mvlst correctly identified the  <dig> outbreak isolates  and these all have the same pfge pattern, jpxx <dig> , thus for both subtyping methods e =  <dig> . two of the sporadic case control isolates were also tst <dig>  but these had different pfge pulsotypes from the outbreak strain, suggesting a lack of discrimination by crispr-mvlst in this instance. tst <dig> was seen in two isolates in the initial study of 86 s. typhimurium isolates. all isolates within each outbreak were identified using crispr-mvlst, thus obtaining perfect epidemiological concordance with this subtyping method.

discussion
foodborne illness caused by salmonella enterica species, particularly by s. typhimurium and s. heidelberg, accounts for  <dig> % of salmonellosis annually in the united states  <cit> . for accurate outbreak tracking and routine disease surveillance, it is critical that we employ rapid, efficient and robust subtyping methodologies. pfge is the current gold standard for molecular subtyping of salmonella and other methods include aflp, mvla and crispr-mvlst.

crispr sequence analysis is one of the cheaper and faster methods for salmonella subtyping  <cit> . for the majority of isolates analyzed, crispr-mvlst could be completed in less than 24 hours, including dna isolation and analysis. additionally, by virtue of their nature, sequencing data are more robust and tractable; this type of data is unequivocal and, with regards to inter-laboratory or database use, is highly consistent. they also provide increased downstream utilities that involve analysis of sequence information, such as phylogenetic studies. this approach is also in line with other high-throughput subtyping approaches, including real-time crispr analysis  <cit>  and whole genome sequence analysis  <cit> . conversely, although protocols exist that allow pfge to be completed in 24 hours, it can often take 1–3 days, requires skilled personnel, inter-laboratory data analysis can be challenging and the data have no utility beyond subtyping. given the advancement of whole-genome sequencing technologies, typing methods based on these are in development  <cit> . while highly discriminatory, limitations to this approach that are not issues with either crispr-mvlst or pfge include the time required for analysis and space required for data storage.

crispr spacer analysis alone has been used to analyze several different salmonella serovars  <cit> . fabre and colleagues showed that among  <dig> isolates of s. typhimurium and its i, <dig>   <cit> ,12:i- variant, combined crispr <dig> and crispr <dig> sequence information is comparable to pfge . both methods were more discriminatory than phage typing analysis of the same set of isolates. the same study also analyzed spacer content of s. typhimurium and s. enteritidis from  <dig> outbreaks and in all cases crispr sequences exhibited high epidemiologic concordance.

a preliminary investigation showed that addition of crispr spacer analysis to an mvlst scheme improves discrimination, beyond that provided by either approach independently, in eight out of nine of the most common illness-causing salmonella serovars  <cit> . we wanted to extend our evaluation of crispr-mvlst utility among predominant and clinically relevant salmonella serovars. to date we have tested and compared crispr-mvlst to pfge on large numbers of s. enteritidis  <cit> , s. newport  <cit> s, heidelberg and s. typhimurium isolates. among the total  <dig> isolates analyzed here, we found significantly fewer alleles of fimh and ssel, compared to alleles of either crispr locus . given the reduced contribution of the virulence genes to defining sts, their addition may seem superfluous within this subtyping scheme. however, in this data set, fimh alleles define two sts, hst <dig> and tst <dig> and ssel alleles define five sts, tst <dig>  tst <dig>  tst <dig>  tst <dig> and tst <dig>  this further supports earlier findings showing that addition of mvlst to a crispr-based subtyping scheme increases discrimination in s. enteritidis  <cit>  as well as among a broad set of salmonella enterica serovars  <cit> .

though the number of isolates for each serovar was similar, the number of sts within each serovar is surprisingly disparate: among 89 s. heidelberg isolates we identified  <dig> hsts and in 86 s. typhimurium isolates, we identified  <dig> tsts. this presumably reflects varied levels of clonality in different serovars. independently of the number of sts defined for either serovar, the crispr loci are responsible for the vast majority of alleles:  . in s. heidelberg, 50% of the different alleles identified were crispr <dig> alleles. given that crisprs are of one of the more dynamic loci in bacteria  <cit> , this finding is not unexpected.

although pfge was more discriminatory than crispr-mvlst among  <dig> s. heidelberg isolates , a combination of both techniques provided an improved value of  <dig> . this represents a 92% probability that two unrelated strains can be separated. jf6x <dig>  is the most common pfge pattern in pulsenet for s. heidelberg  <cit>  and is seen 30– <dig> times a month by the cdc. in our data set, 42% of the isolates have the jf6x <dig>  pattern and using crispr-mvlst, we were able to further separate these into seven distinct crispr-mvlst types . given the frequency at which this pfge pattern occurs nationally, not all isolates that have this pattern may be associated with a specific outbreak, further enhancing the utility of crispr-mvlst as a complement to pfge analysis. collectively, these findings in s. heidelberg show that the jf6x <dig>  pattern is analogous to the jegx <dig>  pattern in s. enteritidis, where the latter was observed in 51% of isolates analyzed and was separated into  <dig> distinct sts  <cit> . a proposed improvement for discrimination in s. heidelberg and s. enteritidis by pfge is to increase the number of enzymes used for pfge analysis  <cit> , though the concurrent use of pfge and crispr-mvlst would be much more efficient than this approach.

regarding s. heidelberg, our data are similar to that observed in a broad set of s. enteritidis isolates  <cit> : both serovars exhibit fewer number of sts identified and both require combining crispr-mvlst and pfge to obtain a sufficient discriminatory power. this presumably reflects similar levels of clonality in s. heidelberg and s. enteritidis as compared to more heterogenous serovars such as s. typhimurium where we observed many more sts present within a similar number of isolates examined.

our data show that in s. typhimurium, the discrimination provided by either pfge or crispr-mvlst is similar . when crispr-mvlst was applied to outbreak isolates, we were able to correctly identify the  <dig> isolates representing the two outbreaks, showing an extremely good epidemiologic concordance with this typing method. the epidemiologic concordance was better by crispr-mvlst than pfge in identifying isolates from the  <dig> bus trip outbreak and both methods had equal epidemiological concordance for the  <dig> live poultry outbreak. regarding the  <dig> outbreak, the majority of isolates had the jpxx <dig>  pulsotype. in our initial study, this pulsotype was seen frequently, 16% of all isolates analyzed, and the  <dig> isolates with this pattern could also be represented by  <dig> distinct tsts. conversely, all isolates from this outbreak have tst <dig>  which is unique and not seen in our initial data set showing that in this instance, crispr-mvlst may be a better subtyping approach. in analyzing the  <dig> live poultry outbreak, it appears that pfge is more discriminatory than crispr-mvlst, as crispr-mvlst also identified two non-outbreak related isolates as tst <dig>  given the available epidemiological data available, these two isolates do not appear to be associated with the outbreak. the fact that crispr-mvlst works better in some instances than others is not surprising and can also occur when other subtyping methods are used. ‘problematic’ pfge pulsotypes also exist and is one reason that second generation methods like mlva and crispr-mvlst are being developed  <cit> . as a recent example, isolates associated with the 2012 s. typhimurium cantaloupe outbreak, had a common pfge pattern so additional subtyping by mlva was performed to correctly define the outbreak strain  <cit> . that there is a strong association among closely related sequence types and closely related pfge patterns for both s. typhimurium  and s. newport  <cit>  provides further evidence that crispr-mvlst could serve as an appropriate alternative subtyping method.

beyond the data shown here and in further evaluating the value of crispr-mvlst sequence typing, a recent study investigating s. typhimurium isolates from a variety of animal sources showed an association of crispr-mvlst sequence types and resistance to antibiotics  <cit> . as part of that study, the most frequent tsts were tst <dig> and tst <dig>  both of which were found in this current study. tst <dig> was also the most frequent clinical sequence type seen in this study  but only two isolates were tst <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
crispr-mvlst is a relatively new subtyping approach with limited studies conducted in salmonella that demonstrate its utility  <cit> . our data here add to this body of work by demonstrating its functionality in two highly prevalent clinical serovars. investigation of several more outbreak strains using crispr-mvlst will elucidate the true capability of this subtyping method. our data here show that crispr-mvlst can be used in concert with pfge, as in the case of s. heidelberg, or potentially as an independent subtyping method, as in the case of s. typhimurium.
