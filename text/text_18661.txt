BACKGROUND
since the first genetically modified tomato was approved, the number and production of genetically modified  crops have continuously increased  <cit> . according to the international service for the acquisition of agri-biotech applications ,  <dig> types of plants and  <dig> transgenic events were developed and commercialized worldwide by the end of march  <dig>  <cit> . however, the perceived risks of genetically modified organisms  to food safety and the environment have raised concerns  <cit> . to provide consumers with information on food, many countries have developed legislations to determine the threshold of gmo ingredients. the threshold for mixing gmos in feed and foodstuffs are  <dig>  % in eu, 3 % in korea, 5 % in japan, and 1 % in new zealand and australia  <cit> . in china, the mandatory labelling of gmo products is required without setting a clear threshold value according to the regulations on administration of agricultural gmos safety  <cit> .

the isolation of unknown dna sequences flanked by known sequences is an important task in the event-specific detection of gmos. both rapid amplification of cdna ends  and thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr  are effective methods for this purpose  <cit> . fraiturea et al.  <cit>  also used a dna walking strategy using a genome walking kit on rice products. to comply with gmo labelling regulations and ensure product legality and traceability, event-specific detection methods are essential for gmo identification and quantification. event-specific detection was primarily performed at the dna level using polymerase chain reaction -based methods because of its high specificity for the flanking sequence of the exogenous integrant. in case of quantitative analysis, the taqman-based real-time quantitative pcr  method is preferred, reflecting the high accuracy  and precision  of this method. however, this method has some obvious drawbacks. notably, pcr inhibitors, such as chloroform, ionic detergents, etc., the experience of the technicians, and the matrix effect of the pcr tubes affect standard curve-based qpcr  <cit> . particularly, the significant bias observed when the target is present at low concentrations could seriously limit the use of qpcr  <cit>  another requirement for qpcr is reference material for gmo at serial concentrations, as standard curves for quantities of endogene and exogene are prepared separately. the lack of certified reference material has been also a hindrance for qpcr. despite the shortcomings of qpcr, this method is convenient for qualitative detection and cheap in terms of instruments and reagents compared with dpcr.

digital pcr  has rapidly developed since it was first conceived in the  <dig>  <cit> . in dpcr, the reaction mixture is distributed in a large number of partitions containing zero, one or more copies of the target nucleic acid. after end-point amplification, the signal would be positive  or negative  for partitioned samples  <cit> . the absolute number of target nucleic acid molecules in the original sample prior to partitioning can be calculated from the ratio of positive to total partitions using poisson distribution . compared with the real-time pcr methods, pcr inhibitors do not impact dpcr, and this method does not need reference material for gmo at serial concentrations  <cit> . digital pcr also is an effective approach to detect snp variants in a diluted target sample  <cit> . the development and application of absolute quantitative detection through the duplex chamber-based digital pcr of genetically modified maize events has been reported  <cit> . stevanato demonstrated that dpcr could differentiate all varieties of sugar beet samples carrying specific snp alleles associated with flowering at low concentrations  of the target sequence, while qpcr and hrm showed only a moderate frequency   <cit> .

thus, this technique is better suited for international-trade applications. currently, two designated dpcr technologies are commercially available: micro fluidic chamber digital pcr  and emulsion droplet digital pcr . both commercial systems enable suitable gmo testing. according to our experience, each sample would cost approximately us $ <dig>  in ddpcr, while each sample should cost us $ <dig> to us $ <dig> per chip or plate in cdpcr  <cit> . in addition, ddpcr has higher repeatability than cdpcr according to the results of preliminary experiments using three genes .

potato is one of the first important transgenic plants  <cit> . the main purposes of gene transfer technology for potato were to improve the quality of potatoes and enhance pest-resistant varieties. monsanto, a company in us, developed a range of anti-coleopteran pests and transgenic potatoes against leafroll virus prior to  <dig>  <cit> . recently, the quality of potato starch has been improved in more commercial transgenic potatoes, such as transgenic potato amflora  and transgenic potato am04- <dig>  <cit> . these transgenic potatoes produce amylose-free starch through the antisense inhibition of the gene encoding granule bound starch synthase i   <cit> . these improved functionalities are not only promising for technical applications in paper and textile, but also in the food industry for the production of dairy products, soups, sauces and noodles. the transgenic potato av43-6-g <dig> in the present study is a variety of starch potato intended for starch isolation by the starch industry, and the starch might undergo further processing.

in the present study, the exogenous gene fragment and flanking sequence of transgenic potato av43-6-g <dig> were obtained using the 5′-race method. according to information about the determined sequence, a pair of primers and a taqman probe were designed based on the exogenous fragment and endogenous chromosomal sequence of potatoes. an event-specific detection method was developed for the transgenic potato av43-6-g <dig> using real-time pcr and ddpcr.

qualitative pcr assays
the potato endogenous beta-fructosidase gene  and event-specific sequence of gm potato av43-6-g <dig> were separately amplified using potato av43-6-g <dig> dna and  <dig> negative non potato av43-6-g <dig> dna samples.

real-time pcr was performed with a real-time pcr instrument . each dna sample was amplified in a 25-μl reaction in a  <dig> -ml tube containing  <dig> nm each of primer f, primer r, and probe, 10× taq buffer , 2 mm magnesium chloride,  <dig> nm each of datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp,  <dig>  units of taq dna polymerase , and 100 ng of extracted dna template  <cit> . after initial denaturation at  <dig> °c for 120 s, the pcr conditions were optimized through 45 cycles of amplification . in each rt-pcr setup, the reaction systems were filled with purified water  and negative sample dna as negative controls. the same baseline was used for the threshold cycle  to compare the rt-pcr performances of the extracted dna and negative dna samples. for sensitivity tests of event-specific primers and probes, the concentration of the dna template ranged from  <dig>  to 100 ng.

droplet digital pcr reactions and analysis
droplet digital pcr was performed using a bio-rad qx <dig> droplet system . the reaction mixtures contained 10 μl of 2× ddpcr™ supermix  for probe, 1 μl of primer and probe, and 5 μl of dna template, in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. each concentration was repeated in three parallel reaction cells. the optimized cycling program for ddpcr assays included a denaturation step at  <dig> °c for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at  <dig> °c for <dig> s,  <dig> °c for 1 min, and 98°c for 10 min. after pcr cycling, the fluorescence signals were collected using a qx <dig> droplet reader. the data were acquired and analysed using quanta soft software  <cit> .

the absolute sensitivity of the samples was realized after diluting 100 % genomic dna to a 10 ng/μl solution. subsequently, the 10 ng/μl solution was diluted  <dig> times at a 10-fold dilution.

duplex droplet digital pcr reactions were performed using a fam-labelled probe for the endogenous gene fru and a vic-labelled probe for the av43-6-g7-specific sequence at a concentration of 1 × 10- <dig> ng/μl  <cit> , with  <dig> repeat reactions.

the detection data for ddpcr using bio-rad platforms was analysed using bio-rad analysis software . the number of positive partitions for both event-specific and endogenous amplifications for each sample were counted using bio-rad platforms. based on the poisson distribution, the original copy number of the different samples was calculated using the following equations  <cit> :  <dig> aav43‐6‐g7specificsequence=–lnn–x/n×n 
  <dig> bendogenousgenefru=–lnn–y/n×n 


in the above two equations, a  and b  were the estimated copy numbers of the endogenous and event-specific genes for each panel. n was the total number of partitions; and x and y were the positive wells for the av43-6-g <dig> event-specific genes and the endogenous gene fru. the gmo proportion was calculated using the following equation:  <dig> aav43−6−g7specificsequencebendogenousgenefru× <dig>  


in equation ,  <dig>  was used as a correction coefficient for the different copy numbers of endogenous gene and screening gene in the genome. ten samples of pure gm potato av43-6-g <dig> were utilized to examine the av43-6-g <dig> event-specific sequence and the endogenous gene fru using digital pcr. the average ratio of av43-6-g <dig> event-specific sequence and endogenous gene fru was  <dig> .

RESULTS
characterization of the 5′-flanking region of transgenic av43-6-g <dig> potato
according to information of “overall application of amylopectin potato event av43-6-g <dig> based on regulation  on 1829/2003″ from the website   <cit> , the integrated heterologous dna in potato av43-6-g <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  the dna fragment  was derived from the 5′-flanking region using 5′-race.

to identify and analyse the junction region of the exogenous integrant and the host genomic dna of potatoes,  <dig> specific primers  were designed based on the sequence of the lac operon from m <dig> mp  <dig> to amplify the 5′-flanking sequences using 5′-race. the race-pcr product was sequenced. figure  <dig> shows the 5′-junction sequence of an exogenous integrant of the av43-6-g <dig> potato. this sequence comprised a 239-bp fragment from m <dig> mp  <dig> and an unknown 221-bp dna sequence.fig.  <dig> frame of transgenic elements in the av43-6-g <dig> potato genome. a schematic diagram of the integrated exogenous gene in av43-6-g <dig> potato, where ‘a’ means artificial poly linker sequence; b flanking sequence of the potato genome and left border sequence of exogenous gene. the sequence in the grey background was obtained from the potato genome, while the other sequence was exogenous and obtained from the left border and the lacl gene. the sequence of primer f was obtained from the potato genome, and that of primer r and probe was obtained from the av43-6-g <dig> potato




because there is little sequence-related information on the potato genome available from the genbank database, it was impossible to determine whether the unknown dna sequence  was derived from the potato genome. therefore,  <dig> pair of specific primers  was designed based on the 470-bp dna sequence, and qualitative pcr was performed using the dna of av43-6-g <dig> potato, gmo ph05-026- <dig> potato, wild potato, and  <dig> other gmo plant lines as templates. as expected, specific dna amplification was observed in av43-6-g <dig> potato, gmo ph05-026- <dig> potato, and wild potato, but unobservable in the other  <dig> gmo plant lines . hence, the unknown dna sequence was derived from the potato genome.fig.  <dig> the amplification curves and standard curve for detecting gm av43-6-g <dig> potato using real-time pcr. a specificity tests of av43-6-g <dig> potato and the other  <dig> plant samples. b amplification plots and standard curve for the event-specific quantitative pcr assay of av43-6-g <dig> potato. amplification curves  were generated to quantify av43-6-g <dig> potato




specific for av43-6-g <dig> potato of real-time pcr assay
based on the revealed 5′-flanking sequence, event-specific primers were designed and used in a qualitative pcr assay of av43-6-g <dig> potato. as expected, following the event-specific qualitative pcr assay of av43-6-g <dig> potato, a passive real-time pcr amplification curve was obtained for av43-6-g <dig> potato, whereas no amplification curve was observed for the other gm lines  <cit>  .

determination of the lod of real-time pcr
to test the limit of detection  of the established method of event-specific real-time pcr, the dna templates diluted along seven gradients were prepared at concentrations of 100 %, 10 %, 1 %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  %, corresponding to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  ng av43-6-g <dig> potato haploid genome in a total of 100 ng of dna per reaction, respectively. a total of  <dig> parallel reactions were performed among triplicate samples. as expected, av43-6-g <dig> potato dna at  <dig>  ng, corresponding to approximately  <dig>  % ng of genomic dna of av43-6-g <dig> potato, was detected. the quantitative pcr results showed that the squared regression coefficient  of the standard curve was  <dig>  . the high pcr efficiency and favourable linear relationship between the log dna quantity and the fluorescence value  suggested that these primers and probes were suitable for quantitative measurements of av43-6-g <dig> potato genomic dna. hence, the lod of the event-specific quantitative pcr assay was  <dig>  ng/action genomic dna.

determining the loq of ddpcr
given the limitations of ddpcr for the quantification of gmo in food and feed samples, particularly at low target levels and in some complex matrices, generally accepted minimum performance requirements for analytical methods should be satisfied  <cit> . to avoid biases in comparing real-time pcr with ddpcr, inter-laboratory validation of real-time qpcr assays were alternatively used to validate the ddpcr using minimum adaptation. therefore, apart from the master mix and settings specific to the qx <dig> droplet system, the primers and probe nucleotide sequences and concentrations, dna concentration, and pcr thermo-profile were the same as those used in the real-time pcr assays .fig.  <dig> the digital pcr picture of serial concentration of genomic dna in av43-6-g <dig> potato in absolute sensitivity and relative sensitivity analysis. a analysis of absolute sensitivity. dna was diluted along five concentration gradients, including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  ng/μl, from left to right. for each concentration, three parallel samples were tested. b analysis of relative sensitivity. samples with a concentration of 100 %, 50 %, 10 %, 1 %, and  <dig>  % of av43-6-g <dig> potato haploid genome per reaction concentration are shown from left to right, respectively. three parallel samples were tested for each concentration




the absolute limit of quantification  is the lowest target copy number in a sample that can be reliably quantified with an acceptable level of precision and accuracy  <cit> . in the absolute sensitivity analysis, all samples for determining dynamic range were prepared through serial dilution of a single stock av43-6-g <dig> potato-specific dna sample. the genomic dna of av43-6-g <dig> potato was tested along  <dig> concentration gradients. for each sample, copies of the endogene and flanking sequence were separately measured using ddpcr. for individual endogene targets and for the flanking sequence content, the coefficient of correlation r <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the correlation coefficients obtained from ddpcr met the requirements  set by the european union reference laboratory for gm food and feed for acceptance of a quantitative pcr-based detection method for gmo  <cit>  .table  <dig> relative sensitivity for the av43-6-g <dig> potato




in analysing relative sensitivity, the dna template was diluted at a concentration of 100 %, 50 %, 10 %, 1 %, and  <dig>  % of av43-6-g <dig> potato haploid genome, respectively. when  <dig>  % sample of av43-6-g <dig> potato in a total of 50 ng/reaction potato dna was detected, the experimental values and group rsd  were high, thus the accuracy of sample concentrations was higher than  <dig>  % av43-6-g <dig> potato in a total 50 ng/reaction potato dna. the loq of each target group in the ddpcr assays was estimated as the lowest copy number within the dynamic with a relative standard deviation  of the measured copy number ≤25 %  <cit> . when the nucleic acid concentration is 50 ng per reaction, the  <dig>  % concentration of the target nucleic acid can be quantified as  <dig>  %, with an rsd of  <dig>  %. the results in duplex droplet digital pcr reactions with  <dig>  % target nucleic acid were quantified as  <dig>  %, with an rsd of  <dig>  %  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> the amplification hot maps of ddpcr using the bio-rad system. for the different colours in c, black indicates negative for both fam and vic, the blue and green indicate positive only for fam or vic, and orange indicates positive for both fam and vic




this result was consistent with the requirements of the test methods  <cit> . because the genome size of the potato is 840 mb  <cit> , the loq for ddpcr was  <dig> copies in a total of 50 ng dna/reaction, consistent with a range from  <dig> to  <dig> copies in routine qpcr testing  <cit>  .table  <dig> absolute sensitivity for av43-6-g <dig> potato




discussion
this finding demonstrates that the av43-6-g <dig> potato/hmg ddpcr assay can be performed over a wide range of target concentrations to determine the av43-6-g <dig> potato content in a given sample and that values of approximately  <dig>  copies constitute the range of quantification with ddpcr. the absolute limit of quantification  is the lowest target copy number in a sample that can be reliably quantified with acceptable precision and accuracy  <cit> . the aloq of ddpcr systems for hmg or av43-6-g <dig> potato was estimated as the lowest copy number of  <dig>  , which was within the dynamic range with a coefficient of variation  of the measured copy number of 25 %  <cit> . based on this criterion, aloq was estimated at approximately  <dig>  copies for the system. the results showed that ddpcr and real-time pcr have their own advantages. the applicability of ddpcr for gmo detection has previously been investigated and demonstrated as comparable to real-time pcr  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the 5′-exogene integration sequence was isolated, and event-specific qualitative and quantitative pcr assays were performed for identifying and quantifying potato av43-6-g <dig>  the lod of real-time pcr was  <dig>  copies. a total of  <dig> copies, corresponding to a concentration of  <dig>  %, reflected the relative sensitivity. in relative sensitivity experience, the lowest concentration was  <dig>  %, which was considered practically sensitive, as this value was lower than the thresholds of  <dig>  % in eu. the ddpcr assays of potato av43-6-g <dig> introduced and performed here achieved a limit of quantification of approximately  <dig> target copies with an rsd ≤ 25 %. the aloq of this system was approximately  <dig>  copies. these results suggested that these methods are suitable for detecting the gmo content in internationally traded products.
