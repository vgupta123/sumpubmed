BACKGROUND
because of their ubiquity and low virulence, coagulase-negative staphylococci  have generally been considered to be nonpathogens or simple contaminants. recently, their clinical significance is being increasingly recognized with the elucidation of their pathogenicity. cns can form biofilms and have been demonstrated to exhibit antibiotic resistance  <cit> . s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. lugdunensis, to a lesser extent, are well-known etiological agents of implanted device-mediated infections  <cit> . s. saprophyticus can cause community-acquired infections of the uropoietic tract. hence, species-level identification of cns is necessary for correct guidance of clinicians in terms of appropriate treatment strategy, and a wide variety of identification methods have been proposed.

many automated phenotypic identification systems are commercially available, including the microscan , vitek  <dig> , and crystal gp  systems. on the basis of metabolic activities and/or morphological features, these systems enable microbiologists to identify bacterial isolates at the species level with greater ease, accuracy, and rapidity than that previously achieved  <cit> . however, these systems have several potential problems:  different strains in one species may not exhibit a specific characteristic,  isolates from old cultures may not show the expected biochemical patterns,  isolates from a host who has undergone long-term antimicrobial therapy may alter their typical biochemical characteristics,  the same strain may not yield the same results in repeated tests,  the databases have data on a limited number of species,  phenotypic variation may affect the accuracy of species-level identification by automated phenotypic systems, and  phenotypic systems often suggest  <dig> or more designations with comparable probability levels  <cit> .

recently, genotypic methods are emerging as the new standard for bacterial identification in automated laboratories  <cit> . 16s ribosomal rna  sequences comprising both variable and conserved regions allow for clear differentiation between organisms not only at the species level but also at the subspecies level  <cit> . these sequences permit better identification of rare or phenotypically aberrant species as well as nonculturable bacteria. the microseq  <dig> system  is a commercially available software system for 16s rrna analysis.

despite the increasing clinical significance of cns and the growing use of automated phenotypic systems in clinical laboratories, few studies have systematically evaluated the accuracy of these systems  <cit> . in the present study, the accuracy of  <dig> commercial phenotypic systems  for cns identification was compared. 16s rrna sequencing and microseq  <dig> analysis were used as references  <cit> .

RESULTS
clinical isolates
by using in-house primers and the microseq  <dig> v <dig>  database, we successfully identified all the  <dig> clinical isolates with more than 97% matches . the identified species were as follows:  <dig> s. capitis,  <dig> s. caprae,  <dig> s. cohnii,  <dig> s. epidermidis,  <dig> s. haemolyticus,  <dig> s. hominis,  <dig> s. lugdunensis,  <dig> s. saprophyticus,  <dig> s. simulans, and  <dig> s. warneri. blood culture specimens primarily contained s. epidermidis, whereas a variety of uncommon cns were isolated from pitted keratolysis specimens. the result reflected the typical distribution of staphylococcal species detected routinely in microbiology laboratories.

identification using microscan
the overall performances of  <dig> phenotypic systems are summarized in table  <dig> and the incorrect identification results are listed in table  <dig>  of  <dig> isolates, correct identification, low-level discrimination and misidentification were  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. nonidentification was not observed. three s. caprae isolates were not correctly identified , because the species s. caprae is not included in the microscan version  <dig>  or  <dig>  database. one of the s. epidermidis isolates  was misidentified as s. aureus.

correct identificationa: single, unambiguous, correct identification at the species level

low-level discriminationb: two or more possible species level identification including the correct one

misidentificationc: genus or species-level identification different from that obtained with the reference method

nonidentificationd: no identification or unidentification

identification using vitek 2
in the vitek  <dig> analysis, correct identification, low-level discrimination and misidentification were  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. nonidentification did not occur. of note, the analysis of  <dig> s. epidermidis isolates  resulted in low-level discriminations – multiple identifications as s. hominis, s. epidermidis, or aerococcus viridans with low percent probabilities, suggesting s. hominis with the highest percent probability followed by s. epidermidis .

identification using crystal gp
crystal gp is not as fully automated as the other two, as the reading of the biochemical reaction depends on manual reading. in order to prevent the bias resulting from manual reading, the biochemical reaction results were read by two different technicians, followed by repeated tests on wrongly identified isolates or those with multiple identifications or nonidentifications. the identification results of  <dig> isolates  using the crystal gp system agreed with those of the microseq  <dig> system with confidence factors of more than  <dig>  . in total,  <dig> %  were misidentified, and  <dig> %  could not be identified . low-level discrimination was not observed. misidentifications at the genus level occurred for  <dig> s. epidermidis and  <dig> s. hominis isolate . the crystal gp system correctly identified all the isolates of s. cohnii, s. haemolyticus, s. saprophyticus, s. simulans, and s. warneri.

discussion
with the increased attention being given to the clinical significance of cns, clinical laboratories must correctly identify cns at the species level by using reliable and reproducible methods. because clinical microbiology laboratories are increasingly becoming dependent on automated systems, the accuracy of these systems must be investigated. in the present study, the accuracy of  <dig> phenotypic identification systems for cns identification was tested and compared with the sequencing of 16s rrna.

microscan and vitek  <dig> showed similar concordance rate to microseq  <dig>  vitek  <dig> showed a slightly higher "correct identification" rate . when the low-level discrimination results that included the correct identification were considered together, the concordance rates were  <dig> %  for microscan and  <dig> %  for vitek  <dig>  crystal gp had the lowest correct identification rate . all  <dig> systems had misidentifications: single but incorrect identification results with higher than acceptable probability of over 85%, which is consistent with the system manufacturer's reported homology value without additional verification, or with higher than a confidence factor of  <dig> . this indicates that cns identifications made using these phenotypic systems cannot always be considered accurate, regardless of the reported probability.

in microscan analysis, none of the s. caprae identifications were correct . this is because the species s. caprae is not included in the microscan database, which illustrates the inappropriateness of this database. ambiguous identifications, including low-level discriminations and misidentifications, were observed for  <dig> out of  <dig> species  with the microscan system, compared with  <dig> ambiguous identifications with the vitek <dig> system and  <dig> with the crystal gp system. this finding was consistent with results reported by other researchers who found that the microscan system has greater accuracy in the identification of s. epidermidis and s. saprophyticus than for identification of other species  <cit> . the other notable finding of the present study is that  <dig> s. epidermidis isolate from blood culture was misidentified as s. aureus with  <dig> % probability, which could have delayed appropriate treatment for the patient.

in vitek  <dig> analysis, low-level discriminations of  <dig> s. epidermidis isolates  occurred, compared to higher correct identification rates with the microscan and crystal gp systems . some researchers reported different sort of difficulties in identifying s. epidermidis with vitek  <dig>  <cit> . however, others reported high accuracy of vitek  <dig> for the identification of staphylocccal species  <cit> . the performance of vitek  <dig> in the identification of cns including s. epidermidis seems not to be determined yet, and the additional testing such as manual biochemical testing or sequencing is required for the accurate diagnosis.

the crystal gp system provides no guidelines for the interpretation of the confidence factor, therefore, all isolates with confidence factors lower than  <dig>  were retested. in spite of repeated testing, this system had the lowest correct identification rate and the highest rate of nonidentification.

one limitation of this study is that additional biochemical testing was not preformed. 16s rrna sequencing might not be a perfect method for interspecies discrimination. however, not all the suggested biochemical tests are available in many automated laboratories or based on our experience, manual testing could not resolve the ambiguity of cns identification in many cases. to improve reliability in this study, all isolates with discrepancies or uncertain results were retested using isolates preserved in skim milk at -70°c.

CONCLUSIONS
none of the tested systems  are able to accurately identify all of the staphylococcal species evaluated in this study. additional verification via molecular testing or suggested biochemical tests may prove helpful for correct cns identification.
