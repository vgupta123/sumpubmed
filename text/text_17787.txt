BACKGROUND
in utero microinjection of mouse embryos has proven valuable for exploring the developmental consequences of altering gene expression using adenoviral or retroviral vectors  <cit> , or for injecting cells to study cell lineage or migration  <cit> . microinjection is also a useful approach for rescuing mutant embryos to validate gene therapies and/or circumvent embryonic morbidity or mortality thereby permitting study of a gene's role later in development or adulthood  <cit> . this approach has been largely limited to studying embryos at embryonic day  <dig>   or greater when the uterus and decidua have become thinner and the placenta and embryo are relatively large so that ultrasound or trans-illumination can be used to guide injections into the conceptus in the exteriorized uterus. however, knocking out or mutating genes critical for early development of the yolk sac, chorioallantoic placenta, hematopoietic system, embryonic heart and vasculature often cause embryonic lethality before e <dig>   <cit> . thus, the goal of the current study was to develop and validate methods to accurately target specific regions of the conceptus under high-resolution ultrasound guidance at e <dig>  to e <dig>  of gestation. at this stage, the embryo is not yet dependent on placental or circulatory function for survival. we show that ultrasound-guided microinjection into the ectoplacental cone region at e <dig>  or e <dig>  and the amniotic cavity at e <dig>  was achieved with a  <dig> day postnatal survival of ≥60% and that target accuracy of these sites and of the exocoelomic cavity at e <dig>  was ≥51%, suggesting this method will provide a feasible approach for future studies.

RESULTS
ultrasound imaging of the early embryo
we used a  <dig> mhz ultrasound transducer to image the conceptus within the exteriorized uterus in isoflurane-anesthetized pregnant mice, and compared results with histological images of the conceptus obtained at the same gestational ages . at e <dig> , a relatively echogenic  ectoplacental cone region and a small echolucent  cavity containing the embryo was visualized inside a ~ <dig>  mm thick decidua. the  <dig> dimensional  impression of the e <dig>  conceptus in real-time  was clearer than was evident from 2d still images . the most prominent structure in the conceptus at this stage was the cone-shaped ectoplacental cone region where embryonic trophoblast cells are invading the mesometrial maternal decidua and where the future placenta will develop. this region is bordered by echogenic calcium deposits  <cit>  making it an easily identified target on ultrasound. the diameter of the proamniotic cavity containing the embryo was ~ <dig> μm at e <dig> , which was near the limit of resolution of the ultrasound transducer  and the outer diameter of the microinjection pipette . thus, only the larger echogenic ectoplacental cone region presented a feasible target at this gestational age.

at e <dig> , the amniotic and exocoelomic cavities, and the ectoplacental cone region were each discernable on ultrasound . when compared to an appropriate histological section at the same gestation , the structural detail in the ultrasound image can be appreciated. as at e <dig> , the 3d impression of the e <dig>  conceptus observed in real-time  was clearer than in 2d still images .

dissection to establish conditions for accurate bead microinjection
the maximum injection volume that resulted in few or no beads off-target was determined in  <dig> mice at e <dig>  as follows. we began by microinjecting an aqueous suspension of  <dig> μm diameter green fluorescent beads into the amniotic cavity at a volume of  <dig> nl, which was approximately 50% of the lowest previously published volume  <cit> . this caused marked distension of the cavity and surrounding area so we gradually reduced the volume to  <dig>  nl in successive experiments. injection accuracy and frequency of beads in adjacent off-target areas was visually evaluated using a stereomicroscope in implantation sites that were dissected as previously described  <cit>  within a few hours following microinjection.

we found that microinjection volumes of  <dig> nl or more into the e <dig>  amniotic cavity visibly distended the cavity. at necropsy, the injected  <dig> μm diameter fluorescent beads were frequently found in adjacent off-target cavities . this is consistent with our volume estimate of ~ <dig> nl for the embryo and both cavities . distension and beads in adjacent off-target regions were minimal when a volume of  <dig>  nl was injected at a rate of  <dig> nl/s.

with a suitable injection volume of  <dig>  nl established, we next evaluated the accuracy of targeting the amniotic cavity , exocoelomic cavity , and the ectoplacental cone region  at e <dig>  . the accuracy of targeting the ectoplacental cone region at e <dig>  was similarly determined . a few hours following microinjection, mice were euthanized then dissected under a stereomicroscope and the concepti placed in a 96-well plate filled with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline . each conceptus was examined under a stereomicroscope and the location of fluorescent beads recorded . less than 10% of injected concepti were damaged during dissection and were excluded from analysis. greater than 90% of concepti contained beads  but they were not always confined to the target. microinjections where many beads were off-target were excluded from the "on target" count because they were considered inaccurate even if some beads were in the targeted location. examples of "on target" microinjections are shown in figure  <dig>

at e <dig> , a volume of  <dig>  nl microinjected at a rate of  <dig> nl/s into the ectoplacental cone region resulted in beads being present in 91% of concepti  . however, beads were specifically localized to the ectoplacental cone region in only 51% of those injected . use of a smaller injection volume may improve accuracy at this age. targeting accuracy of the ectoplacental cone region was significantly improved at e <dig>  . at e <dig> , beads were localized to the ectoplacental target in 90% of concepti   . in  <dig> μm frozen tissue sections at e <dig> , fluorescent beads were visible in the ectoplacental cone region  suggesting that beads could be used in future studies to mark the site of microinjection in histological sections  <cit> . at e <dig> , we were also able to target the exocoelomic and amniotic cavities. our success at targeting with few or no beads off-target was 81% for the exocoelomic cavity and 68% for the smaller amniotic cavity .

assessment of embryonic survival and effect of development on localization of beads
embryonic survival following microinjection was determined up to  <dig> week following birth . between e <dig> – <dig> , mice injected at e <dig>  were euthanized, the uterus removed, and the individual embryos dissected. embryos with normal coloration, and without evidence of autolysis were considered to have survived. additional mice were allowed to progress to delivery. the number of live pups on the day of birth , and at one-week post delivery was determined. the number of survivors relative to the number of injected sites was determined for each mouse. the localization of beads was determined up to  <dig> days post microinjection. determination at later time points was more difficult because of rarefaction of the beads due to growth and development of the tissue mass containing the beads, and the inability to detect beads embedded within the embryo or placenta due to increased tissue opacity.

ectoplacental cone region
following microinjection into the ectoplacental cone region at e <dig> , 78% of embryos in  <dig> mice were still alive when assessed  <dig> to  <dig> days later, 73% of pups from  <dig> mice were still alive at birth, and 68% were still alive at  <dig> week of age . in  <dig> of the  <dig> mice evaluated during pregnancy, the conceptus was dissected within  <dig> days post injection and the localization of beads was assessed by gross morphology. 74%  of the embryos were alive of which 95%  had beads in the conceptus. 95%  of these had beads predominantly localized to the placental region.

following microinjection into the ectoplacental cone region at e <dig> , 89% of embryos in  <dig> mice were still alive when assessed 2– <dig> days later . in  <dig> of these mice, the localization of beads was determined by gross morphology. 79%  of the embryos survived of which 96%  had beads in the conceptus. 94% of these  had beads predominantly localized to the placental region. histology was performed on  <dig> concepti with surviving embryos from one pregnant mouse at e <dig>  to determine the location of beads more precisely using  <dig> μm frozen sections. the vast majority of injected beads were localized in the placental spongiotrophoblast layer . a few beads were often observed between the yolk sac membranes, and a few beads were occasionally observed in the labyrinth or amniotic cavity. localization of beads within the spongiotrophoblast layer is consistent with the ectoplacental origin of cells in this layer  <cit> . 66% of pups of  <dig> mice were still alive at  <dig> week after birth. surviving neonates had no apparent abnormalities in morphology or body size.

exocoelomic cavity
when we performed microinjection into the exocoelomic cavity at e <dig> , 78% of embryos in  <dig> mice were still alive when assessed 2– <dig> days later . the localization of beads in  <dig> of these  <dig> mice was assessed in concepti with surviving embryos by gross morphology. 90%  had beads in the conceptus and in all cases the majority of beads were present in the placental region. while assessing the location of the beads we noted that the fluorescent beads were visible, trapped on the placental surface . in  <dig> of these mice we further assessed the location of the beads within the placenta by performing  <dig> μm frozen sections at e <dig>  and found the fluorescent beads to be distributed deep within the placental labyrinth in cross-sections . this was observed in 80%  of placentas from surviving embryos in the  <dig> mice that were assessed. possibly beads within the exocoelomic cavity and/or beads adherent to the allantois or chorionic surfaces following injection into this cavity became trapped following allantoic attachment and subsequent invasion into the chorion, and by this means were carried deep into the developing labyrinth during chorio-allantoic morphogenesis  <cit> .

amniotic cavity
we assessed survival after microinjection of the amniotic cavity at e <dig>  in  <dig> mice. 68% of embryos were still alive when assessed 2– <dig> days post injection. the distribution of beads was assessed in  <dig> embryos from  <dig> pregnant mice  <dig> days following microinjection into the amniotic cavity at e <dig> . 82%  survived and all had beads within the conceptus. 62%  of the surviving embryos were found to have fluorescent beads on their skin and deep within their structure. the deeper beads may have become trapped within the neural tract during neural tube closure . 73%  of similarly injected surviving embryos examined 4– <dig> days following microinjection at e <dig>  had beads visible within their skin surface. at this stage, tissue opacity made detection of deeper beads difficult to assess. 60% of pups of  <dig> mice were still alive at birth and at  <dig> week of age . surviving neonates had no apparent abnormalities in morphology or body size.

sham experiments
we performed sham experiments to assess the effect of microinjection on embryo viability. we also determined survival in non-operated control pregnancies. for sham  <dig>  all experimental procedures at e <dig>  were replicated except no microinjection was performed . for sham  <dig>  uterine horns were exposed at e <dig>  to count the number of implantation sites and then were immediately replaced. for normal survival in non-operated control pregnancies, we determined embryonic number as a function of gestational age in control mice without prior interventions. we examined an average of  <dig> pregnant mice per gestation day from e <dig>  to e <dig>  at necropsy, and counted the number of viable embryos. linear regression was used to show that the average number of embryos at e <dig> was  <dig> and the rate of embryo loss per day was  <dig> . this information was used to calculate the average embryonic survival rate in pregnancies without interventions at specific gestational ages.

in sham  <dig>  54% of embryos were alive and appeared normal when assessed at  <dig> week postnatal age . this rate did not differ significantly from survival rates following microinjection into the amniotic cavity  or the ectoplacental cone region   indicating that the embryonic lethality was predominantly due to the surgical procedure not to the microinjection procedure. in sham  <dig>  survival at  <dig> week postnatal age was 84% which was significantly higher than in sham  <dig>  . sham  <dig> survival at birth  was close to the 89% survival expected for non-operated control pregnancies. thus, optimal embryonic survival depends upon keeping the duration of the surgical procedure short and minimizing uterine manipulation.

CONCLUSIONS
ultrasound-guided microinjection provides a feasible approach for experimental interventions into either the embryonic  or extra-embryonic  regions. limitations include the presence of beads in off-target locations and a significant increase in embryonic deaths. in the current study we injected fluorescently labeled microspheres in vehicle . in future studies the vehicle could include inhibitory rna, transfection vectors, specific antibodies, or labeled cells and thus this method could be used to explore the developmental consequences of altering gene expression, or for studying cell lineage and migration. however, whether the localization of cells, small molecules or solutes would be similar to that of the beads used in the current study is unknown. this limitation may be addressed by microinjecting bioactive agents tagged or absorbed to spheres, or by microinjecting cells that are labeled so that spheres or cells can be localized later either grossly during dissection or in histological sections.

we speculate that microinjections into the exocoelomic cavity may be useful for studies of the development of the yolk sac , the interactions between the allantois and chorioallantoic placenta  and the development of the placental labyrinth layer. in addition, the ectoplacental cone region can be targeted directly, thereby placing agents among relatively undifferentiated, early placental trophoblasts. since umbilical blood flow does not commence until approximately e <dig>   <cit> , injected agents are likely to remain within this target location and not circulate systemically in the embryo unlike placental injections performed in later gestation. microinjections into the amniotic cavity may be useful for influencing early events in embryonic development such as gastrulation, axis formation, and neural tube closure.
