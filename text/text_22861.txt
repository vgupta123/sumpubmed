BACKGROUND
male infertility is becoming increasingly prevalent partly due to environmental factors, but many defects in sperm development arise from a genetic cause. problems in the production and maturation of sperm are the most common causes of male infertility resulting in low sperm numbers, morphologically abnormal sperm or low sperm motility  <cit> . despite efforts to reveal the genes and their functions in spermatogenesis, little is known about the underlying causes of male infertility. therefore, the localization and identification of mutations specifically affecting spermatogenesis provide invaluable information for investigating the causes of male infertility.

mammalian spermatogenesis is a complex process, where diploid spermatogonia develop into haploid, highly specialized spermatozoa. spermatogenesis includes many testis-specific processes that are controlled by complex regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . during spermiogenesis, haploid round spermatids undergo dramatic biochemical and morphological changes that are governed by specialized gene expression and interactions between various genes and their protein products  <cit> . identification of genes involved in sperm development is a prerequisite to understanding the molecular mechanisms of spermatogenesis.

sperm development is known to be disrupted during spermiogenesis in several acrosomal defects; e.g. globozoospermia in humans, where spermatozoa lack an acrosome  <cit>  and the knobbed acrosome defect  in bulls, boars, stallions, rams, and dogs  <cit> . the acrosome is an organelle that develops over the anterior half of the head in the spermatozoa. it is a cap-like structure derived from the golgi apparatus. the acrosome contains digestive enzymes, which break down the zona pellucida of the ovum, allowing the sperm to deliver its haploid nucleus into the ova. disturbances of acrosomal development and function significantly impair the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa  <cit> .

knobbed acrosome defect has been recently described in the finnish yorkshire pig population  <cit> . testicular weights of boars with kad did not differ from control boars. however, affected boars had a smaller seminiferous tubule diameter and lower number of sertoli cells relative to control boars  <cit> . investigation of the pedigrees of ka-affected boars suggested an autosomal recessive inheritance of the defect. generally two common boars were identified in the pedigree of the boars with the kad. fertility of ka-affected boars is severely compromised. depending on the amount of knobbed spermatozoa  affected boars had poor non-return rate from no pregnancies to 47%, thus ka-affected boars produced no offspring or on average  <dig>  fewer piglets per litter than control boars. here we have characterized further the severity of the sperm head abnormalities in ka-affected boars.

a whole genome scan with microsatellite markers showed increased homozygosity in ka-affected boars in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . however, no statistically significant association was detected with available microsatellite markers. in this study we have used the porcinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip  in order to increase marker density and accurately map the kad associated region in pigs. all affected boars were homozygous for snps covering  <dig> kb on porcine chromosome  <dig>  the coding region of two genes was located within this homozygous region and sequenced from both a ka-affected and control boar.

RESULTS
microscopical analysis of the kad
in the confocal laser scanning microscopy three-dimensional reconstructions of the spermatozoa with acrosomal granules indicated that the granules protruded on both sides and contained a vacuolum . tem analyses confirmed the three-dimensional protrusion of the granules and the occurrence of vacuoles within the granules. the nucleus was also shown to be affected as evident from the y-shaped form at the apical end  suggesting that the defect affects both the chromatin and acrosome. these findings highlight that this particular and previously unknown ka-defect appears to be a serious form of the acrosomal granule defect.

snp quality measures
based on all available snps and the method to estimate ibds in the plink software package  the average relatedness among cases and controls was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these levels of relatedness are typical in the studied finnish yorkshire pig population. the average sample call rate was 95%. there were  <dig> snps that did not work for any of the samples analysed. excluding these snps, the average snp call rate was  <dig>   and the average minor allele frequency was  <dig>  . overall, the dataset contained  <dig> monomorphic snps. observed distribution of p-values in the hardy-weinberg equilibrium test statistics did not differ from expectations. in total,  <dig> snps  had a p-value < <dig> e- <dig> being lower than expected.

genome wide association analysis
the association test was performed for  <dig> snps. the manhattan plot of the log <dig> based p-values is presented in figure  <dig>  the recessive model identified a kad associated region covering approximately  <dig> mbp between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp  on chromosome  <dig>  after permutation, five snps were statistically significant . four of these snps  are located within a  <dig>  mbp region and were in complete linkage disequilibrium .  <dig> out of  <dig> kad cases had inherited two identical copies of the haplotype covering these and other snps between them, indicating an extended homozygosity in this region, and thus a common ancestral origin . all ka-affected boars shared a  <dig>  mbp homozygous region between snps dias <dig> and alga <dig> . the casi <dig> snp was in stronger linkage disequilibrium with alga <dig> and other significant snps compared with neighbouring snps, highlighting that the position of casi <dig> may change following a more refined genome build in this region . the fifth significant snp  was located  <dig> mbp from the other four snps, and was shown to be in linkage disequilibrium .

candidate genes hecw <dig> and stk17b
the most promising candidate gene ubiquitin-protein ligase e <dig>  was located within the haplotype of two snps with the highest p-values; alga <dig> and drga <dig> . all ka-affected animals were homozygous for these snps and only two control animals had the same homozygote alleles as ka-affected boars . furthermore, one of these two animals appeared to have a sme-defect and another was removed from breeding at young age due to weak leg conformation and therefore no fresh sperm samples were available for analysis. the sme-defect is a cyst malformation in the sperm head, with indications that this is of acrosomal origin  <cit> .

hecw <dig> is expressed in the testis  <cit>  and functions in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis  <cit> . ubiquitin signals have been detected during acrosome development  <cit>  and deubiquitinating enzyme mubpy is upregulated in the testis of wobbler mouse, which is infertile due to the lack of a functional acrosome  <cit> .

another gene within the kad homozygous region was serine/threonine kinase 17b . stk17b is a serine/threonine kinase, which has a role in the regulation of apoptosis  <cit> . stk17b is highly expressed in the testes where the apoptosis plays an important role during spermatogenesis. even though the phenotype of ka-affected boars does not implicate a defect in apoptosis the expression and sequence of stk17b mrna was determined.

analysis of the porcine hecw <dig> gene
the expression pattern of different hecw <dig> fragments  appeared to be comparable in the ka-affected and control boar. the full-length mrna of porcine hecw <dig>  was sequenced from the testis of one ka-affected and one control boar. the total length of the sequenced hecw <dig> transcript was  <dig> bp with a high homology with other mammalian species. when compared to the human hecw <dig> gene, the porcine sequence started at position  <dig> bp in the exon  <dig>  in the pig, exon  <dig> did not appear to be expressed in the testis. however, based on the genome sequence, exon  <dig> was highly conserved compared with the human suggesting that it may have an important role in hecw <dig> expression, at least in some tissues. in man, the protein coding region starts at mrna position  <dig> bp . the human hecw <dig> protein consists of  <dig> aa. current data suggests that the corresponding pig protein sequence is  <dig> aa with a 96% homology to the human sequence. similarly, the full-length hecw <dig> protein in the mouse includes  <dig> aa and has 95% homology to hecw <dig> in the pig.

the exons , position of the fragment within the hecw <dig>  and stk17b  mrna and the length of the pcr amplicons are shown.

sequencing of the porcine hecw <dig> mrna and the exon  <dig> from genomic dna of a ka-affected and control boar showed two snps at mrna positions  <dig>  and  <dig> bp . snp <dig> causes a change in the protein sequence at position  <dig> aa from isoleucine to threonine . this snp was further genotyped for all  <dig> ka-affected and  <dig> control boars. all ka-affected boars were homozygous for this snp, but also four control boars had the same homozygous allele, discounting this as the causal mutation of the kad. in addition to these two snps, a deletion of nine bp  was detected after the nucleotide at position  <dig> bp  when compared to the porcine reference sequence . this deletion seems to be very common in mammalian species . the porcine reference sequence for hecw <dig> included exons 3- <dig> , however our sequencing results indicate that exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are also expressed in the pig testes.

analysis of stk17b mrna
the sequenced testicular mrna of porcine stk17b  contained exons 1- <dig>  and  <dig> bp. translation start codon was identified at position  <dig> within exon  <dig>  no change in the expression profile was identified and the protein coding sequence was identical in the ka-affected and control boar.

discussion
while the results of homozygosity mapping of the kad in a previous study  <cit>  were not statistically significant, they did indicate the most probable positions of the kad-associated chromosomal segments. in this study we confirmed the association between kad and porcine chromosome  <dig>  the initial genome screen with microsatellite markers s <dig> and sw <dig> showed increased homozygosity in kad affected boars  <cit> . the genome scan with porcinesnp <dig> genotyping beadchip  localized the kad associated region between these two markers on porcine chromosome  <dig>  the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip illustrated a high call rate  in the finnish yorkshire pig population and only 15% of the snps were monomorphic. in this study we detected the kad associated region covering  <dig> mbp indicating that the marker map in the initial screen was not dense enough to detect the significant increase in homozygosity.

within the associated region we identified and sequenced two candidate genes ubiquitin-protein ligase e <dig>  and serine/threonine kinase 17b . the sequencing of these two genes revealed two snps within hecw <dig> gene, but no polymorphisms were detected in the protein coding sequence of stk17b. although the identified mutations appeared not to be the causal cause for the kad, hecw <dig> remains a good candidate gene for this defect considering its role in acrosome development and chromatin remodelling.

protein ubiquitination is one of the fundamental regulatory post-translational modifications controlling intracellular signalling events. ubiquitin-proteosome-dependent proteolysis plays an important role in selectively degrading and recycling proteins in many basic cellular processes including spermatogenesis  <cit> . for degradation by the proteosome, binding of ubiquitin with substrate proteins requires the activity of ubiquitin-activating enzyme e <dig>  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig>  and substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase e <dig>  <cit> . ubiquitin ligase e <dig> in combination with an e <dig> ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme causes the attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein.

in spermatogenesis ubiquitination is required for various processes; for example the replacement of the spermatids nuclear histones with protamines during spermatid elongation  <cit> . in spermatozoa, proteosomes are located on the plasma membrane overlying the acrosome, in the acrosomal and postacrosomal regions, in the head-tail connecting-piece, middle-piece of the tail, and residual bodies  <cit> . proteosome subunit psmc <dig> and an ubiquitin protein ligase rnf19a have been located at the cytosolic side of outer and inner membranes of the acrosome  <cit> . the co-immunoprecipitation and localization of psmc <dig> and rnf19a in spermiogenesis points to the participation of the ubiquitin-proteosome system in acrosome formation, spermatid head shaping, and development of the head-tail coupling apparatus and tail  <cit> .

malfunction of components in ubiquitination system has been shown to be a cause of male infertility  <cit> . there appears to be a special requirement for certain components of the ubiquitin system during spermiogenesis, in particular  <cit> , and it is probable that different spermatogenic phases would require different specialized activities of the ubiquitin system. mutations in ubiquitination related proteins may also affect specifically spermatogenesis through their testis specific interacting partners  <cit> . a malfunction of ubiquitination may cause diverse phenotypes as exemplified in the human and mouse by mutation of hr6b and usp <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrate the exact kad phenotype in mature sperm. in addition to the acrosome, the spermatid chromatin is also affected. we have located the homozygous region for kad within  <dig>  mbp on porcine chromosome  <dig> containing two genes stk17b and hecw <dig>  the role of ubiquitination in chromatin remodelling and acrosome formation is consistent with hecw <dig> being involved in this defect. while a causal mutation for kad was unable to be identified, our results indicate that the observed phenotype may be caused by a malfunction in the ubiquitination system. identification of the causal variation for the kad requires further analysis of the genomic region containing the hecw <dig> gene.
