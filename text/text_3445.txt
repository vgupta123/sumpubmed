BACKGROUND
retinitis pigmentosa  is a genetically heterogeneous retinal degeneration characterized by the sequential degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors. the first clinical signs are night blindness and narrowing of the peripheral field of vision which progressively worsens to become "tunnel-like". eventually, the central vision is reduced to complete blindness in most cases. at a cellular level, the retinal rod photoreceptors involved in night and side visions slowly degenerate. subsequently, the cone photoreceptors responsible for both color and high-contrast vision, visual acuity, detail perception and normal light vision are similarly affected. to date, no treatment is available.

this apoptotic degeneration is genetically associated with many mutated loci that encode proteins predominant expressed in retinal rod photoreceptor neurons. the cone loss proposed a paradox since, in a significant proportion of rp patients, the mutated gene is not expressed in these cells. as cones are responsible for the most crucial visual functions, the mechanisms that trigger their degeneration are major therapeutic targets. the retinal degeneration  <dig>  mouse is the most studied animal model for the human disease. it carries a recessive mutation in the rod-specific cgmp phosphodiesterase beta subunit gene leading to rod photoreceptor death through apoptosis  <cit>  followed by cone death presumably through lack of trophic support  <cit> . we used expression cloning to identify a trophic factor secreted by rods that promotes cone viability in the rd <dig> mouse; rdcvf, for rod-derived cone viability factor  <cit> . in the model proposed, rod degeneration results in a decrease of rdcvf expression, which subsequently leads to cone degeneration due to a lack of trophic support  <cit> .

the rdcvf gene, also called thioredoxin-like  <dig> , encodes the q8vc <dig> uniprot  <cit>  protein, which has limited similarity to the thioredoxin superfamily  <cit> . thioredoxins  are usually small proteins which can be involved with pleiotropic activities such as redox control, regulation of apoptosis and cytokine activity  <cit> . the txn conserved active site contains two distinct cysteines  that contribute to a thiol-oxydoreductase activity  <cit>  catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds in multiple substrate proteins  <cit> . the rdcvf gene encodes two products via alternative splicing: a full length protein and a c-terminal post-transcriptionally truncated protein sharing similarities with trx <dig>  this latter form of human thioredoxin- <dig>   <cit>  has no thiol-reductase activity but is involved in controlling growth of peripheral mononuclear blood cells  <cit> . similar to txn, rdcvf looks like a bifunctional gene because it encodes both a long form  having a putative thiol-oxydoreductase activity  <cit>  and a short form  with trophic activity for cones but no redox activity.

in this paper we report genomic investigations that revealed rdcvf <dig> as a gene paralogous to rdcvf. like rdcvf, rdcvf <dig> is spliced into two alternative mrnas translated into a long  and a short  thioredoxin-like proteins called rdcvf2-l and rdcvf2-s respectively. we explored orthology in available vertebrate genomes and analyzed homology with the thioredoxin superfamily. we also investigated the cone trophic factor activity of rdcvf <dig> and find it to be similar to that of rdcvf.

RESULTS
identification of rdcvf <dig>  a gene paralogous to rdcvf
the mouse rdcvf gene is located on chromosome  <dig> and contains three exons . the rdcvf-s splice variant is composed of a single exon in which the coding sequence is the same as the first exon of the long form extended by one codon followed by a stop codon  and finally a 3' untranslated region . consequently, the last  <dig> amino acids, called the "cap"  of rdcvf-l are missing in rdcvf-s. we identified a paralogous gene on chromosome  <dig> that we call rdcvf <dig> . both sequence and gene structure are highly similar between the two. indeed rdcvf <dig> also encodes both a thioredoxin-like protein  and a shorter form  called rdcvf2-l and rdcvf2-s respectively. the degree of homology between rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> is  <dig> % for the long isoforms and  <dig> % for the short isoforms.

conservation of rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> gene structure during evolution
cone viability is related to the production of the rdcvf-s form and, by extension, to the presence of the stop codon at the end of the first exon required to obtain that isoform. to evaluate conservation of that stop codon further, we mapped the rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> genes on vertebrate genomes available on the ucsc genome browser web site  <cit>  [see additional file 1). both loci were found in  <dig> vertebrates. all these organisms exhibited both genes except takifugu rubripes and tetraodon nigroviridis, in which rdcvf was duplicated at the same chromosomal location  with an additional intron inserted into the first coding exon of this loci. it is noteworthy that the stop codon at the end of the first exon is strictly conserved in the vast majority . this observation implies the possible existence of rdcvfs short isoforms in most vertebrates, excepting gallus gallus and brachydanio rerio rdcvf; tetraodon nigroviridis and takifugu rubripes rdcvfb.

analysis of rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> protein sequences
proteins orthologous to rdcvf referring to the long isoforms of both rdcvf genes, were identified or predicted in vertebrates  according to protein or genome database searches. we aligned protein sequences of rdcvf, rdcvf <dig>  tryparedoxin , nucleoredoxin  and thioredoxin  . as exemplified by a phylogenetic analysis  among the txn superfamily, rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> proteins are closely related to the tryx and nxn members  <cit> . even distant homologs such as crithidia fasciculata tryparedoxin i   <cit>  exhibit  <dig> % and  <dig> % sequence similarity to mouse rdcvf proteins. three insertions in the multiple alignment  allow one to distinguish these phylogenetic protein families . insertion  <dig>  contains the conserved motif wlalp  and clearly discriminates the tryx family  from txn superfamily. insertion  <dig>  and two additional residues  of insertion  <dig> allow one to differentiate the rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> proteins from the rest of the tryx family. finally, insertion  <dig>  unambiguously separates rdcvf from all the other txn superfamily members including rdcvf <dig>  note that the thioredoxin active site c44xxc <dig> is only conserved in  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> vertebrate proteins respectively.

structural modeling of rdcvf and rdcvf2
the high sequence similarity of rdcvfs with tryx proteins prompted us to build the rdcvf structural models with crithidia fasciculata tryx-i crystal structure   <cit>  as a template. by analogy with human txn and trx <dig> models  <cit>  the rdcvf structure models were assumed to maintain the same overall folding. the tryx-i  and rdcvf structures are shown in figure  <dig> panel b.

rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s are expressed in the retina in a rod-dependent manner
we have measured the expression of rdcvf <dig> by rt-pcr. with primers amplifying the short  and long  isoforms, we found that rdcvf2-s and -l are expressed in the wild-type mouse retina . interestingly, rdcvf2-s and -l expression was absent in the retina of the rd <dig> mouse after rod-photoreceptor degeneration. we have also studied the expression of rdcvf <dig> using northern blotting . in addition to the expression in the retina, most likely by rod photoreceptors since its expression is absent in the degenerated retina , we found weaker expression of rdcvf <dig> in the brain and testis. no expression was detected in the whole mouse embryo at embryonic day  <dig> . to determine the expression of genes encoding rdcvf2-s and l across the retina we used in situ hybridization. transcripts for rdcvf2-s and l were detected in the photoreceptor layer. no staining was observed with the sense control probes, supporting the specificity of the rdcvf2-s and l probes . no expression was detected in the rd <dig> retina after rod degeneration .

we next analyzed the expression of rdcvf2-s during the process of rod degeneration . at post-natal day  <dig>  before the onset of rod loss, rdcvf2-s is expressed at similar level in the wild-type and in the rd <dig> retina similarly to the rod photopigment gene rhodopsin. from pn <dig> to pn <dig> the degeneration of rods  is correlated with a decrease in rdcvf2-s expression. these results indicate that rdcvf2-s is expressed in a rod-dependent manner .

rdcvf <dig> mrna is not only expressed in the retina but also in other tissues
we searched in the embl public database for mouse est and mrna sequences corresponding to the rdcvf mrnas to estimate the tissue distribution of each isoform . as reported before  <cit>  rdcvf-l and rdcvf-s mrnas are specifically expressed in eye and retina as 20/ <dig> and 4/ <dig> sequences were found in these tissues respectively. the mouse rdcvf2-l mrna is preferentially expressed in retina  but is also present in other tissue types such as tumor  testis  stem cells  amnion  placenta  oviduct  fetus  thymus  and mammary gland . finally, est and mrna sequences corresponding to rdcvf2-s are exclusively expressed in retina . we were able to detect the expression of rdcvf <dig> in the testis and brain .

rdcvf2-s cone viability effects
the strong similarities between rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> loci in terms of gene organization, conservation of sequence and rod-dependent expression led us to hypothesize that rdcvf2-s protein might also be able to promote cone viability as previously reported for rdcvf-s  <cit> . indeed, the figure  <dig> panel a and b shows that the number of live cells in the presence of rdcvf-s is twice as the control . a less pronounced, but statistically significant, increase in cone viability  is observed for rdcvf2-s. these findings confirm that rdcvf2-s is also a cone viability factor similar to rdcvf-s  <cit> . importantly, no synergistic trophic effect on cones is observed when both rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s are co-tranfected in cos- <dig> cells pointing to use of the same pathway by both factors .

discussion
identification of rdcvf2
in this paper, we report the identification of a gene paralogous to rdcvf called rdcvf <dig>  the analysis of gene structure conservation and the est database searches with experimental validation by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization indicate two alternative transcripts from both genes, expressed in a rod-dependent manner and translated into the rdcvf and rdcvf short and long protein isoforms. a phylogenetic analysis suggests that both genes are strongly conserved in most vertebrates. experimental validations demonstrate a cone viability activity of rdcvf2-s that is similar to the one of rdcvf. taken together, these genes define a novel bifunctional gene family expressed in vertebrate retinas with trophic activity and significant potential as therapeutic targets in human retinal diseases.

bifunctional activity of the rdcvf family members
like thioredoxin, the rdcvf family is bifunctional and pleiotropic in vertebrates. the short isoform exerts a trophic activity while the long isoform's function is unknown, but presumably involves a redox activity. rdcvf and rdcvf <dig> proteins share high sequence and structure homologies with tryparedoxin, a member of the thioredoxin family that might be of functional significance. the non-conservation of the c44xxc <dig> catalytic site implies that the thiol-oxydoreductase activity of the long isoforms in rdcvfs may have become dispensable. nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the cysteins of the catalytic domain are never lost in both rdcvf-l and rdcvf2-l proteins in the same organism.

as it has been previously published  <cit> , our current results contribute to explain the lack of thiol-oxydoreductase activity in the short isoforms of the rdcvfs. since the "cap" region directly interacts with the thioredoxin reductase which recycles the enzyme activity  <cit> , its absence in rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s proteins prevent them from such a redox function.

rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s cone viability and signaling mechanisms
analysis of the rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s structural models provided evidence for two features. first, since the short isoforms of the rdcvfs lack the c-terminal "cap" region of the long isoforms, and have no thiol-oxydoreductase activity, they expose a large accessible hydrophobic patch . this patch may be where these proteins interact with other proteins or cell membrane structures.

second, the three rdcvf-specific insertions  all co-localize at the opposite pole from the catalytic site. this novel surface feature may also constitute an interaction site with a cell-surface receptor expressed by cone photoreceptors. mutation analyses will prove useful in exploring the roles of these two features. since thioredoxin are secreted by a pathway that does not require leader sequence  <cit> , it is also theoretically possible that a putative receptor is present within the cytoplasm of cones and that rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s are diffused through the interphotoreceptor matrix penetrating photoreceptor cells.

rdcvf-s was demonstrated to be involved with cone viability by a 60% reduction in the rescue activity of conditioned media upon rod-enriched retinal explants after immunodepletion with anti-rdcvf-s antibodies  <cit> . the similarity between the two factors suggests that they belong to similar signaling pathways. therefore, rdcvf2-s might be responsible for the remaining 40% cone viability activity. similar experiments using antibodies for both genes would help to determine whether the trophic activity can be full accounted for by these two proteins. co-immunoprecipitation would also be interesting since the short isoforms bear potential interaction domains which imply binding partners. indeed, by analogy with trx <dig> that dimerizes in solution  <cit>  the very large hydrophobic surface created by the "cap" removal of rdcvf-l and rdcvf2-l  may promote homodimerization or heterodimerization among rdcvf-s and rdcvf2-s.

photoreceptors constitute the cells with the highest rate of oxidative metabolism in the body. as the outer retina  is avascular, the oxygen is provided by the high blood flow from the underlying choroid. since this blood flow is not regulated by oxygen consumption, primary rod  degeneration leads to a huge increase in oxygen  <cit> . as thioredoxin enzymes participate in redox homeostasis  <cit> , the rdcvf gene may have originally served an extra thiol-oxydoreductase activity to prevent damage linked to hyperoxia of photoreceptors resulting from light. one could suppose that the rdcvf family bifunctionality might form a regulatory loop in which the long form senses oxygen levels and transfer this signal to the short form that would exert a trophic effect on neighboring cells and would maintain a correct cell-oxygen ratio.

CONCLUSIONS
by data mining using rdcvf sequence, we have identified a novel trophic factor for cone survival. this second factor defines a novel family of bifunctional proteins with potential involvement in neuroprotection and response to oxidative stress. the homology of both factors with the thioredoxin family suggests that the rdcvf family derives from an ancestor thioredoxin gene that has been recruited during evolution to serve the protection of cone photoreceptors.
