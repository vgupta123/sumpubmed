BACKGROUND
chronic fatigue syndrome  is characterized by prolonged and impairing fatigue of unknown etiology  <cit> . the standard definition of cfs requires severe fatigue of over six months duration that remains unexplained despite appropriate clinical medical evaluation along with four of eight signs and symptoms . immune dysfunction is a major etiological hypothesis, and could result from a chronic infection or an inappropriate response to an initial infection  <cit> . multiple studies have investigated the possible role of a range of specific viruses in cfs by searching for case-control differences in past or current viral infection   <cit> . inconsistent findings across studies are normative. the most recent example is xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus  which was claimed to be present in 67% of cases with cfs and  <dig> % of controls  <cit>  but did not replicate in multiple independent samples  <cit> . a recent report found an association between a different retrovirus  and cfs   <cit> . the status of any connection between xmrv and cfs is remains highly controversial  <cit> .

it is possible that the etiology of cfs is not unitary. non-replication across samples would be expected if different combinations of etiological processes were operative in different case sets. alternatively, inconsistent findings across case-control studies could be due to bias if controls are inappropriate to cases. for example, in the initial xmrv study, cases were highly selected  and controls were described only as "healthy"  <cit> . although such individuals are relatively uncommon, the study of discordant monozygotic twins offers substantially improved experimental control   <cit> . we are aware of one previous study that assessed  <dig> pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for cfs for indices of past and current viral infection : no significant or clinically important differences were found between affected and unaffected twins  <cit> .

an additional limitation has been the reliance on assays for specific infectious agents. viruses have traditionally been identified by culture techniques and more recently via a variety of molecular approaches. however, these methods have severe limitations and leave many viruses undetected. we have developed a complete "metagenomic" system for systematic identification of unknown viruses. the discovery pipeline has four components: virus enrichment, amplification of genomic viral dna or rna, large scale sequencing, and identification of known and novel viral sequences using bioinformatics. this powerful strategy has identified two new viruses, human bocavirus  <cit>  and ki polyomavirus  <cit>  which cause acute respiratory illness in children.

in this study,  <dig> pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for chronic fatigue were used in an exhaustive study to identify risk factors  <cit> . we report here the results of screening for viruses in these samples using metagenomic sequencing. deep sequencing revealed the presence of several viruses in cases with chronic fatigue, particularly gb virus c.

RESULTS
the patient set consisted of  <dig> pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for clinically-evaluated chronic fatiguing illness . most pairs were female , and the median age at evaluation was  <dig> years. of the affected twins,  <dig> met criteria for cfs and  <dig> for icf with a median duration of chronic fatigue of  <dig> years with no significant difference between affected twins with cfs and icf . body mass index was similar between the affected and unaffected twins. affected twins had significantly worse physical and mental functioning on the sf- <dig>  <cit>  and reported significantly greater current fatigue. the mean functioning of affected twins was over a standard deviation worse than swedish norms whereas the unaffected twins were similar to swedish norms .

using metagenomic sequencing to identify viral signatures
serum samples from the affected and unaffected twins were pooled separately and enriched for viral particles. this resulted in four samples to be sequenced in order to detect rna and dna viruses: a dna sample and a cdna sample for pooled samples from affected and unaffected twins. sanger sequencing was performed from all four samples, resulting in a total of  <dig>  sequences from affected twins and  <dig>  from unaffected twins. automated blast searches followed by manual inspection showed that all reads from the unaffected twins were from background contamination  or from reagents used for the library preparation . a small number of sequences showed no or only insignificant blast hits but manual inspection did not reveal any artifacts and these could represent low abundance viral sequences. in contrast, the sequences from the pool of affected twins showed multiple hits to two known human viruses. in total, 168/ <dig>  sequences showed a significant blast identity to gb virus c  and 15/ <dig>  to hepatitis c virus. the numbers of sequences were relatively high indicating that one or more affected twins had high copy numbers for these viruses. no other significant hits to human viruses were observed.

a next-generation sequencing technology, roche  <dig> flx, was used to search for rare viruses in samples from affected twins. a total of  <dig>  sequence reads  were produced from the dna sample and  <dig>  reads  from the rna  sample. the six-fold difference in the numbers of reads was most likely caused by different efficiencies of the  <dig> library preparation and the amounts of dna obtained. the reads were analyzed using our blast search pipeline, both unassembled and assembled  using the miraest assembler. the assembly results are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the blast results are summarized in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> figures s <dig> and s <dig>  for most reads, both hits passed very high blast and coverage thresholds  and those with slightly lower blast scores  represent background contamination. several hundred reads and some contigs showed very weak or no blast hits and there are some weak hits to known virus families. however, none were judged to be clear-cut candidates for novel viruses.

notably,  <dig>   <dig> reads and  <dig>  contigs showed high blast identity with gbv-c. as expected for the rna virus gbv-c,  <dig> % of the reads came from the rna  fraction . similarly  <dig>  reads and  <dig> contigs contained hepatitis c virus sequences, almost entirely from the rna fraction. these results confirmed the significant presence of these viruses in samples from the affected twins. due to the efficient virus particle enrichment procedure used, it is highly likely that these sequences come from free virus particles and that one or more patients have chronic infection of these viruses.

confirmation in individual samples
gb virus c
assessment of the individual samples using nested pcr showed that four samples from affected twins  and zero from unaffected twins  were positive for gbv-c. one affected twin had icf and the rest had cfs. the first round pcr gave a visible product in all four positive cases indicating at least moderately high viral copy number. detection of gbv-c in affected co-twins was slightly but significantly higher than chance expectations .

to assess gbv-c sequence diversity,  <dig>  sequence reads from the rna fraction matching the gbv-c genome were compared with the  <dig> complete gbv-c genome sequences found in genbank. using strict blast score criteria, the gbv-c samples in our data set were found to be quite diverse as regions from  <dig> of the complete genomes were represented in the dataset. however, 51% of the sequences  were divided between five different isolates in roughly equal numbers. gbv-c is known to vary extensively between isolates and the large diversity revealed here indicates that these four affected twins were infected by different isolates and that different variants are present in each individual.

hepatitis c virus
a standard diagnostic serology test confirmed previously unrecognized hepatitis c infection in one affected twin. this discovery provides a plausible medical explanation for chronic fatigue in this individual.

discussion
we used an "unbiased" genomic technology to search for the presence of known and novel viruses that correlate with the clinical presence or absence of chronic fatiguing illness. such searches have proven powerful for respiratory infections  <cit> , and complement studies targeting specific infectious agents  <cit> . the general hypothesis we tested was that chronic fatigue was associated with on-going viremia. as we have argued elsewhere  <cit> , the study of discordant monozygotic twins was optimal in controlling for potential biases particularly as samples were obtained from both twins at the same place and time.

the deep roche  <dig> sequencing, combined with the efficient enrichment of virus particles, makes it likely that most viruses present in the serum of these individuals were detected. however, we did not detect any clear-cut signatures of novel viruses. for known viruses, the predominant finding was a slight but significant excess of detection of nucleic acid from gbv-c in  <dig> % of affected twins and 0% of their unaffected co-twins . previously undetected hepatitis c virus infection was discovered in one affected twin. this individual was kept in these analyses as this is conservative and conforms to our prior intentions.

gbv-c  is an rna virus and member of the flaviviridae family with greatest homology to hepatitis c virus. it is transmitted via multiple modalities   <cit> . gbv-c viremia is present in ~2% of healthy blood donors and 17% show evidence of past infection  <cit> . gbv-c infection is not known to cause any human disease  <cit>  and co-infection might improve the course of hiv- <dig> disease  <cit> . a prior small study of  <dig> cfs cases and  <dig> controls concluded that chronic gbv-c infection was not associated with cfs  <cit> . the lack of gbv-c positive individuals among the unaffected twins is could at first glance be seen as surprising. however, we would statistically expect that one or two individuals would be positive, based on chance, and the result we obtained is therefore not unlikely.

there are several reasons why a chronic infection important to the etiology of chronic fatiguing illness could have escaped detection. for example, viral titers might be beneath the detection limit of our approach, the infection might be intermittently active and not during our sampling, and a salient infection might occur in body compartments or tissues where viral particles do not appear in blood. it is also possible that a salient infection occurred earlier in life, was cleared, but the infection sequelae are responsible for clinical state. such infections, in the case of known viruses, can in many cases be detected via serology. finally, it is possible that chronic fatiguing illness represents a similar clinical endpoint for multiple different disease etiologies  and that etiological heterogeneity effectively lessens the probability of detection.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show a weakly significant difference between affected and unaffected twins in the cross-sectional prevalence of gbv-c viremia. whether this is etiologically important or due to chance or bias is not clear. however, the possible connection between gbv-c and cfs deserves further study in larger samples.
