BACKGROUND
plants can recognize potential pathogens via two perception systems. one of them, named pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns , detects conserved molecules associated with groups of pathogens through pattern recognition receptors leading to pamp-triggered immunity. the other evolved to recognize pathogen virulence effectors, usually through intracellular resistance proteins , causing effector-triggered immunity . eti corresponds to what is classically referred to as gene-for-gene, vertical or race-specific resistance  <cit> . one of the first examples of race-specific resistance in plants was described by barrus  <cit>  in the interaction of colletotrichum lindemuthianum and common bean .

anthracnose, caused by the ascomycete fungus c. lindemuthianum  lams.- scrib., can result in a devastating disease in common bean. bean anthracnose has a worldwide distribution but it is particularly problematic in temperate regions. the pathogen can attack all aerial parts of the bean plant and produces round black shrunken lesions containing flesh colored spores on leaves, stem, pods and seeds. the attack of this fungus can result in premature defoliation, premature fall of flowers and pods, seed deterioration and, in extreme cases, plant death. infected seeds are the major means of dispersal of the pathogen  <cit> . the pathogen shows extensive pathogenic variation, with at least  <dig> pathogenic variants or races reported among isolates of c. lindemuthianum collected worldwide  <cit>  using a set of  <dig> differential cultivars and a standardized method to name the races  <cit> .

resistance to c. lindemuthianum generally follows a qualitative mode of inheritance where resistant and susceptible reactions are clearly differentiated. identification of anthracnose resistance genes by classical genetics is based on the interpretation of results obtained from f <dig> segregating populations derived from two types of crosses: r × s or r × r . results observed in r × s crosses are used to infer the number and mode of action of genes conferring resistance to c. lindemuthianum, while those for r × r crosses are used to identify the specific genes involved in the reaction against this pathogen . since the first anthracnose resistance gene was reported  <cit> , many genetic analyses have been conducted to study anthracnose resistance inheritance in different bean genotypes. up to  <dig> anthracnose resistance loci conferring resistance to specific races  have been described in common bean: co- <dig> to co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig> to co- <dig> and co-u to co-z <cit> . all anthracnose resistance genes described, except for co- <dig>  exhibit complete dominance where the dominant allele conditions the resistance reaction. a complementary mode of action between two independent resistance genes has also been described using f <dig> or f2: <dig> segregating populations, being necessary the presence of both dominant alleles for expression of resistance  <cit> . many genetic analyses assumed that the resistance to different races in a bean genotype is conferred by the same gene. based on this hypothesis, most classical studies considered that different resistance spectra in genotypes were due to different alleles of the same gene. so, different alleles were described for genes co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co- <dig> <cit> .

most identified anthracnose resistance genes were located in the genetic map of common bean: genes co- <dig>  co-x and co-w were mapped on linkage group  pv <dig>  <cit> ; co-u was located on pv <dig>  <cit> ; co- <dig> on pv <dig>  <cit> ; co- <dig> on pv <dig>  <cit> ; co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co-y, co-z and co- <dig> on pv <dig>  <cit> ; co- <dig> on pv <dig>  <cit> ; and co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co-v on pv <dig>  <cit> . mapping of genes conferring resistance to several specific races revealed that some of these co- genes were organized in clusters of race-specific resistance genes. tight linkage associations of many co- resistance genes have been well established on lgs pv <dig>  pv <dig> and pv <dig>  <cit>  corresponding to the named clusters co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co- <dig>  respectively. at a molecular level, the majority of plant r genes cloned so far encode proteins with two specific domains: nucleotide-binding-sites  and a leucine-rich repeat  domain. genes encoding r proteins were found in tandem on chromosome regions corresponding to the co- <dig> and co- <dig> clusters observed in genetic analyses  <cit> .

the anthracnose resistance system in common bean has been classically investigated by analyzing a limited number of isolates or races in different segregating populations. in the present study, the response against  <dig> c. lindemuthianum races was analyzed in a recombinant inbred line  population derived from the cross xana × cornell  <dig> in which a saturated linkage map was previously developed  <cit> . the present study aims to add understanding concerning the organization and interaction between anthracnose resistance genes, and reveals a complex p. vulgaris–c. lindemuthianum interaction.

RESULTS
segregations for the eleven c. lindemuthianum races
parental line xana was susceptible to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and resistant to the remaining six races . parental line cornell  <dig> was susceptible to race  <dig> and resistant to the remaining ten races. table  <dig> shows the observed segregations for resistance to each race in the xc ril population . segregations for resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> conformed with the 1: <dig> resistant:susceptible  ratio, expected for one resistance gene or for three independent resistance genes, complementary two-by-two. segregation for resistance to race  <dig> conformed with the 3: <dig> r:s ratio, expected for two independent genes. segregations for resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> conformed with the 5: <dig> r:s ratio, expected when three independent genes, two with a complementary mode of action, are involved in the resistance response.

to determine if a single gene or different genes of the same cluster were involved in the response, co-segregations for resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were considered. co-segregation for resistance to the four races was observed in  <dig> rils , and in three cases evidence of recombination was found . accordingly, it can be concluded that four different closely linked genes at the co- <dig> resistance cluster in cornell  <dig> determined specific resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . since all evidence suggests a monogenic control of resistance to each of the four races, these resistance genes were directly included in the genetic map .

resistance to race  <dig>  conformed with the 1: <dig> r:s segregation ratio . the contingency chi-square values  deviated significantly from the expectation of random segregation when compared with markers cv <dig> and of <dig>  tagging the co- <dig> resistance cluster. this result indicates that resistance to race  <dig> in xana may be mediated by one resistance gene  located at the co- <dig> cluster. genetic mapping confirmed the position of this gene at the end of lg pv <dig>  in a position corresponding to cluster co- <dig> .

genetic analyses of resistance to race 65
segregation of resistance to race  <dig>  suggests the presence of two independent dominant genes . the chi-square values deviated significantly from the expectation of random segregation when resistance to race  <dig> was compared with molecular markers that tagged the co- <dig> and co- <dig> regions . this result suggests the localization of one resistance gene at the co- <dig> cluster, and a second gene at the co- <dig> cluster. to confirm this model, segregation for resistance to race  <dig> was analyzed in six subpopulations established from the total xc ril population : x-co- <dig> and c-co- <dig>  formed by  <dig> and  <dig> rils showing, respectively, the xana and cornell <dig> alleles for the markers cv <dig> and of <dig>  x-co- <dig> and c-co- <dig>  formed by  <dig> and  <dig> rils showing, respectively, the xana and cornell <dig> alleles for the markers sq <dig> and scareoli. x-co- <dig> and c-co- <dig>  formed by  <dig> and  <dig> lines, respectively, the xana and cornell <dig> alleles for markers 254-g15f <dig> and sw <dig>  in the x-co <dig> subpopulation, the resistance to race  <dig> segregated according to a 1: <dig> r:s ratio, expected in the case of one resistance gene. a linkage analysis carried out within this subpopulation revealed a close linkage between this segregating gene and co-173-x . the localization of a resistance gene for race  <dig> derived from xana at the co- <dig> cluster was confirmed in the x-co <dig> subpopulation, in which the co- <dig> region from xana was fixed; the  <dig> rils of this subpopulation were resistant to race  <dig>  the opposite subpopulation, c-co <dig>  showed a segregation for resistance to race  <dig> according to the ratio expected for one dominant gene . this resistance gene exhibited a close linkage with co-238-c . the localization of a resistance gene against race  <dig> derived from cornell  <dig> at the co- <dig> cluster was confirmed in the c-co <dig> subpopulation, in which the majority of lines showed a resistant phenotype against race  <dig> . independence between resistance against race  <dig> and the co- <dig> chromosome region was deduced from subpopulations x-co <dig> and c-co <dig> – in both these subpopulations there was a 3: <dig> r:s ratio for resistance to race  <dig>  as for the total xc population.

it can be concluded that resistance to race  <dig> was conferred by one gene  in xana located at the co- <dig> cluster on pv <dig> and by a gene  in cornell  <dig> located at the co- <dig> cluster on pv <dig> .

genetic analyses of resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 449
segregation of resistance to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  conformed with the 5: <dig> r:s ratio  expected for three independent genes, two of them having a complementary mode of action. resistance to four races showed close co-segregation. a total of  <dig> lines showed the parental genotypes , while only four lines revealing evidences of recombination .

concerning resistance to race  <dig>  the contingency chi-square values deviated significantly from the expectation of random segregation when resistance to this race was compared with molecular markers tagging the co- <dig> and co- <dig> chromosome regions . this result can be interpreted as one of the resistance genes being located at the co- <dig> cluster and a second gene located at the co- <dig> cluster. concerning the third complementary gene, it segregated independently from the molecular markers tagging the co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co-u regions , so contingency chi-square tests were conducted between resistance to race  <dig> and the remaining  <dig> loci included in the xc genetic map. there was significant deviation, with a block of three markers closely mapped on lg pv <dig> : ind_2_ <dig> ; ind_2_ <dig>  and mctaeta <dig> .

analyses within subpopulations  were consistent with this scenario. within subpopulations involving the co- <dig> cluster  resistance to race  <dig> fitted a 5: <dig> r:s ratio, as for the total xc ril population, suggesting that the co- <dig> region was not involved in genetic control against race  <dig>  however, a change in the segregation ratio was observed within the two subpopulations involving the co- <dig> cluster. good fits to 3: <dig> and 1: <dig> r:s ratios were observed in the x-co- <dig> and c-co- <dig> subpopulations, respectively. this is the expected situation if one complementary gene proceeding from xana is located at the co- <dig> cluster. concerning the co- <dig> cluster, most lines included in the c-co- <dig> subpopulation were resistant to race  <dig> ; and the opposite x-co <dig> subpopulation fitted a 1: <dig> r:s ratio, expected for two independent and complementary genes . both results are expected if the resistance gene derived from cornell  <dig> without a complementary mode of action was located at the co- <dig> cluster. two subpopulations involving lg pv <dig> were also considered for race  <dig> using markers ind_2_ <dig> and mctaeta166: the x-pv <dig> subpopulation including  <dig> rils showing the xana allele for both markers, and the c-pv <dig> subpopulation including  <dig> rils showing the cornell  <dig> alleles. in the x-pv <dig> subpopulation resistance to race  <dig> fitted a 3: <dig> r:s ratio , while the c-pv <dig> subpopulation fitted a 1: <dig> r:s ratio . this situation supports the localization of a complementary resistance gene from xana against race  <dig> in this position of lg pv <dig> 

in summary, results indicate involvement of three resistance genes against race  <dig> : one gene  from cornell  <dig> located at the co- <dig> cluster, and two independent resistance genes from xana with a complementary mode of action, one  located at the co- <dig> cluster on pv <dig> and a second  on lg pv <dig>  the same model deduced for resistance to race  <dig> is valid for resistance to races  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all genes showing close co-segregation.

genetic analyses of resistance to race 453
resistance to race  <dig>  fitted a 1: <dig> r:s segregation ratio . in this case, the chi-square values  deviated significantly from the expectation of random segregation when compared with molecular markers that tagged two different chromosome regions: sw <dig> and of <dig>  and sq <dig> and scareoli . this finding provides evidence concerning the presence of more than one gene in the resistance response against race  <dig>  given the observed ratio, the most probable explanation is that resistance to race  <dig> was controlled by three independent resistance genes having a complementary mode of action two-by-two . according to the results , one of these genes would be located at the co- <dig> region and another probably located at the co- <dig> region. the third complementary gene segregated independently from molecular markers tagging the co- <dig>  co- <dig>  co- <dig> and co-u regions, so contingency chi-square tests between the resistance to race  <dig> and the remaining  <dig> loci included in the xc genetic map were conducted. a significant deviation was observed with a block of  <dig> markers mapped on lg pv <dig>  from marker bm <dig> to mcateag <dig> .

to confirm this model, segregation for resistance to race  <dig> was analyzed within the subpopulations established . segregation for resistance in the x-co <dig> and c-co <dig> subpopulations fitted a 1: <dig> r:s ratio, as for the total ril population, suggesting that this region was not involved in genetic control of the reaction to race  <dig>  in contrast, a change in the segregation ratio was observed in the remaining subpopulations. in the x-co <dig> and c-co- <dig> subpopulations resistance to race  <dig> fitted a 1: <dig> r:s ratio, expected in the case of two complementary and independent genes. this result suggests that both subpopulations lacked one of the three complementary resistance genes. the x-co <dig> subpopulation lacked a complementary resistance gene from cornell  <dig> located on the co- <dig> region while the c-co <dig> subpopulation lacked a complementary resistance gene from xana, located at the co- <dig> region. the observed segregation within the opposite subpopulations, c-co <dig> and x-co <dig>  conformed with the 3: <dig> r:s ratio, thus being consistent with this scenario. if one of the three complementary genes was fixed in a subpopulation, then a 3: <dig> r:s ratio would be expected.

for the third resistance gene against race  <dig>  with location estimated at lg pv <dig> based on contingency chi-square tests , two additional subpopulations were considered using markers ind_9_ <dig> and ata <dig>  in the x-pv <dig> subpopulation, formed by  <dig> rils showing the xana allele for both markers, resistance to race  <dig> fitted a 3: <dig> r:s ratio . in the c-pv <dig> subpopulation, formed by  <dig> rils showing the cornell  <dig> allele, resistance to race  <dig> fitted a 1: <dig> r:s ratio . this result is in agreement with the localization of a third complementary resistance gene from cornell  <dig> at lg pv <dig> 

in summary, results indicate the involvement of three complementary genes, complementary two-by-two in the genetic control of response to race  <dig> : one gene  from xana located on the co- <dig> region, one  from cornell  <dig> located on the co- <dig> region and a third gene  from cornell  <dig> located on lg pv <dig> 

genetic dissection of resistance to race 453
genetic dissection was performed to verify the complex system of resistance observed against race  <dig>  three susceptible lines were selected according to their parental genotype  for markers located in lgs pv <dig>  pv <dig> and pv <dig> , in which were tentatively localized the three complementary resistance genes. parental line xana was susceptible to race  <dig> and according to this model it carried the complementary gene co-3c453-x and lacked co-2c453-c and copv09c453-c. ril xc <dig> showed the cornell  <dig> genotype for markers of the co- <dig> cluster, and the xana genotype for markers that tagged the other two regions, the co- <dig> cluster and the pv <dig> region. based on this, susceptible line xc <dig> should have the co-2c453-c gene and lack co-3c453-x and copv09c453-c. finally, ril xc <dig> showed the cornell genotype for markers tagging the pv <dig> region and the xana genotype for markers of clusters co- <dig> and co- <dig>  thus, it should have copv09c453-c and lack co-3c453-x and co-2c453-c.

a total of 13 f <dig> seedlings were obtained from the cross between the susceptible lines xana  × ril xc <dig>  and all were resistant to race  <dig>  indicating a complementary mode of inheritance. a total of 16 f <dig> seedlings were obtained from the cross xana  × ril xc <dig>  and all were resistant to race  <dig>  finally, from the cross ril xc <dig>  × ril xc <dig>  a total of  <dig> seedlings were obtained, all resistant to race  <dig>  in all cases, cross authenticity was verified using codominant molecular markers. this result confirmed the model of three genes, complementary two-by-two, involved in the genetic control of resistance to race  <dig> in the xc ril population.

discussion
in the present study, the inheritance of resistance to  <dig> c. lindemuthianum isolates classified as different races was analyzed in a ril population derived from the cross xana × cornell  <dig>  in classical genetic analysis, the identification of a resistance gene is based its relationship of independence or linkage with other genes previously described, through allelism tests. molecular markers can help in determining the identity of a resistance gene. molecular markers linked to the main anthracnose resistance genes have been reported  <cit>  and can be used to establish the identity of a resistance gene by means of linkage analyses. the use of saturated genetic linkage maps allows more accurate location of a resistance gene by direct mapping, and also the identification of new resistance loci, independent of those previously described. nevertheless, the use of linkage maps for direct mapping is limited by the number of genes involved in the resistance, and/or by possible epistatic interaction between them. this scenario occurred for the anthracnose resistance genetic analyses conducted on the xc ril population. only reactions to races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exhibited a monogenic segregation and the respective resistance genes involved were directly mapped. resistance to the remaining six races showed complex segregations, involving several mendelian genes with different modes of action. in this case, genetic analyses supported by contingency chi-square tests and subpopulation analyses were proposed as an alternative solution for the analyses of complex segregations involving more than one gene. genome-wide analysis using contingency chi-square tests were conducted to identify the regions of the genetic map showing a significant association with the reaction to a specific race. significant associations between the response to a specific race and a mapped locus suggest a genetic linkage relationship between them, particularly if significant deviations are caused by an excess of the parental classes. subpopulation analysis allows simplification of segregation and testing the involvement of a specific region in the control of the resistance. however, subpopulation size is reduced in respect to that of the original population, so larger original populations are required. finally, genetic dissection was performed in specific cases to check the position of a resistance gene and its mode of action. nevertheless, genetic dissection requires the development of new segregating populations from genotypes showing a specific combination of alleles, and these genotypes are not always available within the original segregating population due to recombination events. this systematic genetic analysis has allowed the drawing of conclusions concerning genetic control of anthracnose resistance in parental lines xana and cornell  <dig> 

results indicate that cornell  <dig> carried a complex cluster of race-specific resistance genes at the end of lg pv <dig>  corresponding to the co- <dig> cluster. four resistance genes  were directly mapped on this cluster, closely linked to markers sq <dig> and scareoli. recombinant lines in the response to the four races were detected, indicating that different resistance genes were present. from the analyses of subpopulations, the presence of another six resistance genes at this position was indirectly deduced: co-23-c, co-27-c, co-219-c, co-265-c and co-2449-c, as well as co-2c453-c with a complementary mode of action. the dominant resistance gene are  was reported in cornell  <dig> protecting against races alpha, beta and gamma  <cit> . resistance genes showing a complementary mode of action have been also suggested in this genotype from the observed segregations in f <dig> populations  <cit> . gene are was introgressed into cultivar ms8eo <dig> from cornell  <dig>  <cit> . using a bc1f <dig> population obtained from the backcross , gene are was mapped at the end of lg p <dig>  closely linked to the scar marker scareoli  <cit> . results of the present study indicated that the original gene are described in cornell  <dig> was in fact a cluster of linked resistance genes with each one conditioning resistance to different races of c. lindemuthianum. a cluster organization including closely linked genes against races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  was also identified in the a <dig> bean genotype in the same genetic position using the f2: <dig> population derived from the cross andecha × a <dig>  <cit> .

results also indicated that genotype cornell  <dig> carried two complementary resistance genes to race  <dig>  one  located in the described cluster co- <dig>  and another  in lg pv <dig> between markers bm <dig> and ata <dig> – this is the first anthracnose resistance gene located in this lg. interestingly, a quantitative trail locus  involved in resistance against pythium ultimum <cit>  was localized to this same relative position. evidence supplied by in silico analysis in the sequenced bean genotype g <dig>  was consistent with the location of anthracnose resistance genes in this position. at least four genes encoding nbs-lrr proteins and four genes encoding protein kinases, all typical r proteins, were annotated between markers bm <dig> and ata <dig> .

genetic control of anthracnose resistance in the cultivar xana had not been previously analyzed. xana showed a resistant reaction against six of the eleven isolates analyzed. genetic analysis suggested that regions on lgs pv <dig>  pv <dig>  pv <dig> and pv <dig> were implicated in the response. resistance to race  <dig> showed monogenic inheritance and the corresponding locus  was directly mapped on the end of lg pv <dig>  subpopulation analysis allowed the deduction of the presence of one additional resistance gene  in this relative position. co-165-x probably corresponds to the resistance gene against race  <dig> mapped in this same relative position from the genotype andecha  <cit> , as andecha is one of the parents from which xana was obtained. the co-173-x gene is closely linked to markers of <dig>  tga <dig>  and cv <dig>  the of <dig> fragment was previously linked to the anthracnose resistance locus co- <dig> in the f2: <dig> population derived from the cross between the near-isogenic lines n <dig> s and n <dig> r  <cit>  and later mapped to pv <dig>  <cit> . a gene conferring resistance to race  <dig> in and <dig> was also located on pv <dig> using a f <dig> population derived from the cross and277 × rudá  <cit> . this resistance gene in and <dig>  that corresponds to co- <dig>  is closely linked to markers cv <dig> and tga <dig> . in the genotype kaboon, co- <dig> was also shown to have a cluster organization, including three resistance genes against races  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in conclusion, different genetic evidence supported the presence of a cluster, including race-specific resistance genes to anthracnose in the relative position in which the co- <dig> gene was mapped .

resistance genes derived from xana against races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were indirectly located on lgs pv <dig> and pv <dig>  all with a complementary mode of action. a gene conferring specific resistance to c. lindemuthianum strains e <dig> and e42b  was mapped to the end of lg pv <dig> in the mesoamerican genotype bat <dig> using the ril population bat93 × jaloeep <dig>  this gene, named co-u, was located in the vicinity of the i locus  <cit> , a complex resistance cluster effective against potyviruses  <cit> . the correspondence between co-u and the resistance cluster identified in xana is not clear, because the i locus and the sw <dig> marker  are included in the xc genetic map, and segregated independently from resistance genes copv02c3-x, copv02c7-x, copv02c19-x and copv02449-x. the physical position of these resistance genes was estimated to be around 40 mbp of chromosome  <dig>  based on the physical position of the indel markers. in silico analysis  was consistent with the location of genes involved in a resistance response in thisposition: eleven genes encoding nbs-lrr proteins, or protein kinases, were annotated in genotype g <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp of chromosome  <dig> .

the location of five resistance genes from xana on lg pv <dig> , all showing a complementary mode of action, was also deduced from the genetic analysis. different anthracnose resistance specificities were mapped in this relative position from the bean genotypes mexico <dig>  widusa, bat <dig>  jaloeep <dig>  mdrk, kaboon, a <dig> and a <dig>  <cit> . in genotype kaboon, one of the genes located at this position exhibited a complementary inheritance against race  <dig>  <cit> . on this position were mapped the well-known resistance genes co- <dig> and co- <dig> <cit> . in this lg, but in a distal position from co- <dig>  was mapped co- <dig> from cultivar ouro negro as a single gene conferring resistance against races  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . to date, independence between co- <dig> and resistance genes included in the co- <dig> cluster has not been clearly established.

this study confirmed a wide variation in the fungus–plant interaction. up to  <dig> race-specific genes could be involved in the resistance to  <dig> isolates. alternative splicing generates multiple transcript variants from single genes and could explain the observed variation in instances in which recombination among race-specific loci was not detected. alternative splicing was found for the rct <dig> gene in medicago truncatula that confers resistance to multiple races of c. trifolli <cit> . a complementary mode of action indicates the cooperation of two genes  in the resistant reaction. combination of several proteins in the recognition of the fungus can be a mechanism generating variation in the interaction; the number of possible combinations for resistance increases. in the guard and decoy models, the effector modifies an accessory protein, which may be its virulence target  or a structural mimic of such a target . the modified accessory protein is recognized by the nbs-lrr receptor. under the bait model, interaction of an effector with an accessory protein facilitates direct recognition by the nbs-lrr receptor  <cit> . two resistance genes could act in a complementary way under any of the three models, with the presence of the two proteins necessary to trigger the resistance response. complementary resistance genes required for mediated resistance pathways have been described in common bean , tomato  <cit> , arabidopsis <cit>  and barley  <cit> . however, no references were found in a model involving three resistance genes which are complementary two-by-two. it is important to note that only if the two parents differ in the two complementary genes, this type of genetic control can be detected. segregation corresponding to a single gene would be expected if the parental lines differ in only one of the two complementary genes. in consequence, the resistance gene detected in a bean genotype against a c. lindemuthianum isolate can depend on the segregating population investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
detailed knowledge of the genetic control of traits  is relevant for the identification of genomic sequences involved in the expression using a positional cloning approach, and the development of plant breeding programs. results confirmed that the response in the p. vulgaris–c. lindemuthianum interaction was very specific, conditioned by both pathogenic variation of the fungus and the bean genotype. genetic control of the resistant reaction in common bean can be controlled by different race-specific resistance genes depending on the bean genotype. many of these genes were organized as clusters of closely linked race-specific genes located in specific chromosome regions, and these resistance genes can exhibit dominant epistatic interaction or complementary mode of action. the identification of resistance clusters suggest that most of the described alleles for the co- <dig> and co- <dig> loci are different and that closely linked loci control the resistance reaction against different races or isolates in a bean genotype. all these aspects should be considered in interpretation of the genetic analysis and the reported results.
