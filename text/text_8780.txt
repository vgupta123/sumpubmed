BACKGROUND
cronobacter spp.  is a non-spore forming, motile, facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus and belongs to family enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . initially isolates of cronobacter spp.  were identified as yellow pigment producing enterobacter cloacae. later, farmer et al.,  <cit>  reclassified them as a new species and were given the name sakazakii based on dna-dna homology, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and certain unique biochemical characteristics such as catalase production, the absence of oxidase and the production of yellow pigment in all tested strains.

more recent studies utilizing full length 16s rrna gene sequencing, ribotyping, fluorescent-amplified fragment length polymorphism and dna-dna hybridization have demonstrated that cronobacter is a heterogenic genus exhibiting a high degree of genetic and phenotypic diversity among species and comprises six species: c. muytjensii, c. sakazakii, c. malonaticus, c. turicensis, c. dublinensis and c. genomospecies i  <cit> . cronobacter is considered an emerging pathogen; though, little is known about its virulence properties and antigenic determinants  <cit> . recently, several studies have reported the involvement of an outer membrane protein , ompa, in pathogenesis of c. sakazakii; however, nothing is known about its antigenicity. besides, little is known about omps from other cronobacter species  <cit> . in contrast, the virulence and antigenic properties of omps of closely related enterobacter species including e. aerogenes  <cit>  and e. cloacae  <cit>  were studied well.

prematurely born infants with low birth weights and infants in neonatal intensive care units are highly susceptible to cronobacter infections with the pathogen being transmitted primarily from contaminated environments to the infant formula during the preparation  <cit> . in rare cases, nosocomial infections can happen in adults especially in immunocompromised ones  <cit> . in  <dig>  a joint fda/who workshop raised an alert concerning the presence of cronobacter in powdered infant formula  and recommended applying higher microbiological standards during its manufacturing  <cit> . this warning culminated into increased research efforts to study cronobacter including the development of improved isolation and identification methods, and understanding of the growth and survival characteristics.

antibodies are the most frequently used tools to study bacterial antigenic determinants; however, little is known about the production of monoclonal antibodies that recognize cronobacter antigenic determinants. in this paper we describe the production and characterization of  <dig> mabs that recognize outer membrane proteins of cronobacter. in addition, antigenic properties, identification, distribution and cell surface localization of the mabs- recognized omps were examined using electron microscopy and maldi-tof spectrometry. to our knowledge, this is the first report on using monoclonal antibodies to study the surface antigens of this pathogen.

production of monoclonal antibodies against cronobacter spp
female balb/c mice  were initially immunized intraperitoneally with  <dig> μl  of heat-killed bacterial suspension  mixed with complete freund adjuvant at a 1: <dig> ratio. subsequently,  <dig> booster doses were administrated at weekly intervals using the same amount of immunogen but prepared with incomplete freund adjuvant. simultaneously, female balb/c mice  were immunized intraperitoneally with  <dig> μl of polyacrylamide-lps preparation in pbs for at least  <dig> wks at weekly intervals. myeloma sp <dig> cells were maintained in rpmi media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum ,  <dig> u of penicillin,  <dig> u streptomycin and  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> amphotercin b. at the day of fusion, the actively grown myeloma culture was washed twice using serum-free media  and adjusted to the desired concentration. the fusion was performed according to the method described by liddell and cryer  <cit>  using 40%  polyethylene glycol  <dig> as the fusing agent in sterile sfm adjusted to ph  <dig> . spleen cells harvested from immunized mice and myeloma cells were fused at a ratio of 8: <dig>  two weeks later, hybridomas were screened for the production of mabs by elisa using heat killed cronobacter and non-cronobacter cells. hybridomas reacting specifically with cronobacter were expanded and cloned at least three times by limiting dilution. positive clones were frozen in recovery cell culture freezing media® or fcs supplemented with 4%  dmso and stored at -80°c overnight before being transferred to liquid nitrogen. the positive clones were propagated either in tissue culture or by ascitic fluid using the procedure of harlow and lane  <cit> . isotypes of purified monoclonal antibodies from ascites or spent medium were determined using the mouse type subisotyping kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

immunochemical methods
elisa
screening of antisera spent medium and ascites for the presence of antibodies against cronobacter was performed by an indirect non-competitive elisa. flat-bottom  <dig> well plates were coated with  <dig>  ml of  of whole cell antigen diluted in  <dig>  m carbonate buffer  overnight at 4°c. alkaline phosphatase-conjugate goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were used as secondary antibodies and substrate, respectively.

additive index elisa
additive index elisa was performed on paired mabs as described by friguet et al.,  <cit> . an additive index for each pair of mabs was calculated according to the formula { - 1} ×  <dig>  where a <dig>  a <dig>  and a1+ <dig> are absorbance values with antibody  <dig> alone, antibody  <dig> alone, and the two antibodies together, respectively.

gel electrophoresis
profiles of cronobacter omps were examined using sds-page following the method described by laemmli  <cit> . the runs were performed in 4% stacking and  <dig> % separating gels. equal concentrations of cronobacter omps  were mixed with sample buffer at a ratio of 1: <dig>  boiled for  <dig> min and loaded . gels were either stained with 1%  coommassie brilliant blue g- <dig> or used for immunoblotting. likewise, lps preparations from cronobacter were examined using deoxycholate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  following the method described by reuhs et al.,  <cit> . briefly, the runs were performed using 4%  stacking and  <dig> %  separating gels. equal concentrations of cronobacter lps  were mixed with sample buffer  at a ratio of 1: <dig>  the gels were pre-run in doc-electrophoresis buffer  for  <dig> min at  <dig> volts before loading the samples. samples were run in the same buffer at  <dig> and  <dig> volts for the stacking and separating gels, respectively. upon completion, gels were either stained using the pagesilver™ silver staining kit  or were used for immunoblotting. band sizes for both gels and blots were estimated using the biorad quantity one 1-d analysis software.

immunoblotting
immediately after completing the electrophoresis run, omps and lps were transferred to nitrocellulose  membranes according to harlow and lane  <cit>  with some modifications. gels and nc membranes were soaked in tris-glycine transfer buffer  for  <dig> min. separated omps and lpss were transferred onto nc using a mini-transblot cell . the membranes were blocked with 3%  bsa in tris buffered saline  containing tween  <dig> . nc membranes were then incubated with affinity purified mabs  diluted in  <dig>  m tbs buffer containing 1%  bsa with gentle shaking for  <dig> h. membranes were then developed with goat anti-mouse-hrp in  <dig>  m tbs buffer containing 1%  bsa and a diaminobenzidine  substrate solution. color development was stopped by rinsing the membranes with distilled water.

protein sequencing and identification
extracted omps were separated on sds-page gels and probed with anti-omp monoclonal antibodies. immunoblot-positive bands were cut with sterile sharp scalpel and immersed in 1% acetic acid solution. protein sequencing was performed using the maldi-tof technology at the proteomics and mass spectrometry facility at purdue university .

dot blot assay
dot blotting was performed as described by jaradat and zawistowski  <cit> . one microliter of heat-killed cronobacter whole-cell suspension  was spotted on the nc membranes, allowed to air dry for  <dig> min and incubated in 5%  naoh or in 38%  hcl for  <dig> s or left untreated. immunoblotting was performed as described above.

immunoelectron microscopy
immunolabeling was performed essentially as described by jaradat and zawistowski  <cit>  with modifications. briefly,  <dig> μl of bacterial suspension in distilled water  were placed on formvar-coated copper grids. after air-drying for  <dig> h at room temperature, the grids were blocked with pbs containing 3%  bsa for  <dig> min at 37°c. to expose antigens on bacteria, grids were incubated with  <dig>  m naoh or  <dig>  m hcl for  <dig> h, washed with water and incubated with purified mab solution at 37°c. grids were then incubated with colloidal gold -conjugate anti-mouse igg diluted at 1: <dig> in dilution buffer  for  <dig> h at room temperature. grids were washed  <dig> times with water and viewed with a zeiss transmission electron microscope at various magnifications.

animal use
animals used for immunization and production of monoclonal antibodies were cared for according to the animal care and use committee , jordan university of science and technology.

RESULTS
two approaches were attempted to produce monoclonal antibodies specific to cronobacter spp.: one group of mice was immunized with heat-killed c. muytjensii atcc  <dig>  while the other group was immunized with lps purified from c. muytjensii atcc  <dig>  repeated immunization with the lps produced a good antibody response as judged from both elisa and immunoblotting results using antisera from lps-immunized mice which revealed the characteristic ladder pattern of lps . however, none of the two immunization protocols resulted in a stable hybridoma producing anti-lps antibodies. nevertheless, mice immunized with heat-killed cells responded well yielding a high titer after  <dig> injections. consequently, mice from this group were sacrificed and two fusions were performed yielding over  <dig> hybridomas of which approximately  <dig> clones were positive upon initial screening and were cloned  <dig> times by limiting dilution  <cit> . of these, only  <dig> stable hybridomas secreted antibodies against cronobacter spp. four of the hybridomas were of igg type , while the last hybridoma  was of the igm class. the avidity of the mabs to their epitopes was determined by elisa. the titration curve for all protein g-column purified mabs, except for a <dig>  revealed that mab-2c <dig> had the highest avidity followed by c <dig>  b <dig> and a <dig> having the lowest. mab a <dig>  an igm, was not tested as it was not purified by protein g column affinity chromatography.

specificity of the monoclonal antibodies
the specificity of the mabs was determined by non-competitive elisa with various heat- killed bacteria belonging to cronobacter and non-cronobacter spp. in general, all mabs reacted with both cronobacter and non-cronobacter spp. with higher titers generally obtained for cronobacter spp. . nevertheless, some non-cronobacter spp. also gave titers comparable to those obtained for cronobacter . the binding affinities varied among the four mabs with mabs 2c <dig> and c <dig> gave titers of  <dig> against almost all the heat-killed cronobacter strains tested, whereas mabs a <dig> and b <dig> had titers ranging between  <dig> to more than  <dig> 

in addition to elisa, the antigenic specificity of all purified mabs was tested against omps extracted from  <dig> cronobacter and  <dig> non -cronobacter strains by sds-page followed by immunoblotting.

sds-page profiles of both cronobacter and non-cronobacter revealed the presence of several proteins with molecular weights ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda  with the majority of omps profiles contained  <dig> to  <dig> major proteins having molecular weights between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. upon immunoprobing, all mabs produced similar reaction profile of proteins with molecular weights between  <dig> to  <dig> kda with only one major band for all cronobacter omp profiles except isolate jor <dig> which did not exhibit any protein . in general, the  <dig> kda protein was the most common among all cronobacter omp profiles. it was detected by immnunoblotting in  <dig> out of the  <dig> tested cronobacter strains , and a  <dig> kda protein was detected in two c. sakazakii isolates , while a  <dig> kda protein was detected in two isolates . in addition, proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> kda were detected each in one c. sakazakii isolate . omps from a number of non-cronobacter species were also tested for reactivity against the purified mabs by immunoblotting. unlike the single band pattern observed in cronobacter omp immunoblot profiles, the non-cronobacter immunoblot profiles exhibited a double-band pattern corresponding to mw of  <dig> and  <dig> kda . in addition, c. freundii  exhibited only one protein corresponding to  <dig> kda, while the only gram-positive control strain  exhibited the same two bands with a higher mw  than those which appeared in samples from the gram-negative isolates. in order to determine which surface antigen the mabs were bound to, omps and lps extracted from cronobacter muytjensii atcc  <dig>  were analyzed by sds-page, doc-page and immunoblotting. all mabs  displayed strong and specific reaction against a  <dig> kda omp . although these mabs were produced from two different fusion experiments, they all reacted strongly and specifically against the same  <dig> kda omp. furthermore, to compare the epitope specificity of all mabs, additive index elisa was conducted for each pair of the mabs. all scores obtained were very low and fall in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> indicating that all mabs were raised against the same epitope within the  <dig> kda omp.

protein identification by maldi-tof peptide sequencing
representatives of the immunoblot-positive proteins were subjected to peptide sequencing and identification using maldi-tof mass spectrometer. table  <dig> shows the identified proteins by maldi-tof. the  <dig> kda protein that was recognized by all the monoclonal antibodies in c. sakazakii appeared to be a novel protein that did not match with any identified protein thus was termed a hypothetical protein.

in addition, the  <dig> kda protein identified in the cronobacter isolate 146a also appeared to be a novel protein termed a hypothetical protein that did not match with any known protein sequence deposited in the protein sequence bank . two cronobacter isolates  exhibited a  <dig> kda protein with identity as a flagellar hook protein flge and an outer membrane porin protein in the two isolates respectively. further, a  <dig> kda protein was recognized in cronobacter isolate  <dig>  and appeared to be an outer membrane protein f which is similar to an outer membrane protein f in e. coli. both e. coli and salmonella contained another similar protein with a mw of  <dig> kda and was identified as an outer membrane protein a. in addition, both exhibited a  <dig> kda porin protein yet appeared to be somewhat different.

effect of different treatments of antigens on mabs binding affinity
to gain insights about the nature of the binding between the mabs and their target epitopes, elisa and dot-blot were carried out using different antigens  which were subjected to different treatments  . acid and base-treatments of whole cell antigens resulted in an increase in the binding affinity between the mabs and those antigens. these results were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. cronobacter muytjensii atcc  <dig> cells displayed intense colloidal gold labeling after reaction with mab 2c <dig>  .

finally, to determine whether the mabs recognized sequential  or conformational epitopes, omps were either left intact or denatured by 1%  sds and boiled for  <dig> min and then used as antigens for elisa. the magnitude of binding of mabs to antigens was higher for untreated omps than the denatured proteins . this indicates that, the epitope is conformational and loses its recognition sites once denatured.

discussion
antibodies against surface antigens of pathogens aid not only in characterization but also in their classification  <cit> . in this study monoclonal antibodies were produced against outer membrane proteins of cronobacter muytjensii. however, we were unable to produce antibodies against lps. inability to produce stable hybridomas against lps could be attributed to the simplicity of the lps structure which is a linear unbranched chain of repeating polysaccharide units as reported by maclean et al.,  <cit> . the linearity of the structure was probably responsible for the inability to elicit a significant immune response which was reflected on the inability to produce monoclonal antibodies against lps of this strain. luk and lindberg  <cit>  initially failed to produce stable antibody-producing hybridomas against lps of salmonella. later, they succeeded when they used whole bacterial cells coated with lps as immunogen. similarly, jongh-leuvenink et al.,  <cit>  and jaradat and zawistowski  <cit>  were able to produce monoclonal antibodies against lps of salmonella. this could be due to differences in the nature of the structure and composition of lps between salmonella and cronobacter spp. and even among different salmonella serovars.

in this study, the anti-omp antibodies were characterized for specificity and all  <dig> monoclonal antibodies not only reacted with cronobacter species, but also recognized other enterobacteriaceae. the low specificity indicates that the major outer membrane proteins in the family enterobacteriaceae are perhaps well conserved as indicated by their antigenic cross-reactivity. the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies was further tested using sds-page and immunoblotting. the sds-page protein profiles for the omps observed in this study were similar to those of omps described by other researchers for other members of the enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . overall, most of the isolates contained omp proteins with mw ranged from 34- <dig> kda  with majority of the isolates exhibiting proteins in the range of 36- <dig> kda with the  <dig> kda protein appeared in all cronobacter species . in contrast, the non-cronobacter isolates  showed slightly different protein profiles among the enterobacteriaceae members and even a slight shift in the tested gram-positive strain, l. ivanovii. the cross-reactivity observed among all cronobacter strains used in this study indicated that some of these omps share common and highly antigenic epitopes. these patterns of cross-reactivity of mabs with omps from bacterial strains within the same species are commonly reported especially for members of the enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . on the other hand, fewer studies have reported the production of anti-omp mabs within species that were non-cross reacting and exhibiting a high degree of specificity  <cit> . the reactivity of mabs to omp and the lack of any reactivity against lps indicated that cronobacter omps appeared to be more antigenic than their lps. this observation coincides with several other reports in which it was demonstrated that omps were stronger immunogenes than lps, and were responsible for producing antibodies with higher affinities  <cit> .

all mabs tested by immunoblotting against omps extracted from c. muytjensii attc  <dig> were able to recognize a  <dig> kda protein. this protein appears to contain a highly antigenic epitope capable of eliciting strong immune response in mice against the cronobacter strain used in the immunization procedure. the identity of this protein was determined by maldi-tof ms to be a hypothetical outer membrane protein esa_ <dig> . this protein appeared to be dominant in this particular strain and protruding to the surface making it highly accessible to the host immune system. the specific function of this protein is unknown but it would be of significant interest in future studies since it was not detected in other strains. other proteins from cronobacter and non-cronobacter  recognized by the mabs were also sequenced and aligned against known protein sequences deposited in protein sequence banks. it appeared that most of these proteins are related in terms of their structure and probably function as most of them were outer membrane proteins. however, a  <dig> kda protein that was identified in two different cronobacter spp. appeared to be different both in structure and function as one appeared to be a flagellar protein , while the second was identified as an outer membrane protein . further, as shown in table  <dig> some of the proteins with the same mw  were identified in three different bacteria and each appeared to have a different peptide sequence and consequently different function yet share epitope similarity as they were all recognized by the same mab indicating a similar function too. interestingly, similar to the  <dig> kda protein, the  <dig> kda protein identified in cronobacter isolate number 146a appeared as novel protein and was termed as a hypothetical protein esa_ <dig> with unknown function. further, a protein of  <dig> kda mw was identified in cronobacter isolate number  <dig> as an outer membrane protein f which is similar to a protein in other e. coli as revealed from the protein bank sequence .

the findings in the current study provide an evidence of great similarity among cronobacter spp. and the other members of enterobacteriaceae. such findings were comparable to several previous studies which reported similar cross reactivity among major omps in gram negative bacteria and among members of the enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . for example, monoclonal antibodies that recognized buried epitopes of the ompc from salmonella typhi were shown to cross react with porins extracted from  <dig> species of enterobacteriaceae  <cit> . in addition, it appeared that omps extracted from cronobacter and non-cronobacter spp. in this study shared similar epitopes. this was evident in the multiple proteins which were recognized by the same mabs that appeared to be specific toward the  <dig> kda omp extracted from the cronobacter strain used for immunization. indeed, these results highlighted the heterogeneity of the omps in the cronobacter isolates.

the effect of acid or base treatment on the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to their antigens was investigated. acid or base treatment increased binding affinity of the antibodies to cronobacter cells. this might be due to an increase in the accessibility of mabs to the surface protein antigens due to removal of some extracellular molecules and/or lps that might have hindered the binding of mabs to their target proteins in the case of whole bacterial cells. for example, lps accounts for up to 70% of the outer monolayer  <cit> . indeed, the masking effect of lps against binding of antibodies to antigens has been reported and therefore it can not be under estimated  <cit> . these observations were further confirmed by immunoelectron transmission microscopy . when live untreated cronobacter cells were probed with mab 2c <dig>  there was no binding to the primary antibodies and hence no gold particle labeling. however, when cronobacter cells were treated with naoh  or hcl , the antibodies appeared to have gained access to their target represented by increased labeling. in addition, the mabs were shown to be bound more strongly to conformational rather than sequential  epitopes highlighting the specificity of the mabs to their epitopes as appeared in table  <dig> <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study that describes the production of monoclonal antibodies against whole cells of c. muytjensii with concomitant identification of the recognized proteins by maldi-tof spectrometry. all mabs produced in this study were reactive against the whole cell antigen and cronobacter omps. mabs reacted with omps of molecular weight ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. however, none of the mabs showed any reaction with lps extracted from cronobacter. all mabs recognized conformational epitopes rather than sequential as it is evident from the decrease in their binding affinity to fully denatured omp antigens. moreover, all mabs exhibited a high cross-reactivity against the whole cell antigen and omps from non-cronobacter. as apparent from the maldi-tof protein identification, the overall results indicated that, the major omps found in the enterobacteriaceae are sufficiently conserved thereby, promoting antigenic cross-reactivity between genera. furthermore, the single-banding pattern and the high titers obtained in immunoblotting and elisa for the cronobacter strains indicated that the omps of closely related strains are more conserved compared with other genera evaluated. the results from this study can be of great help for possible vaccine production against this pathogen in infants and young children.
