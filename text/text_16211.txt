BACKGROUND
the nucleosome, the basic unit of eukaryotic chromatin, consists of a 146-bp dna wrapped around a histone octamer composed of two copies of core canonical histones, h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig>  eukaryotic chromatin also contains a small amount of atypical histones, which have different amino acid sequences than canonical histones, including cenpa, h <dig> , h2a.x, h2a.z, and macroh2a  <cit> . among these histone variants, the macroh2a variants display the most unusual protein structure: an n-terminal h2a domain is fused to a large c-terminal non-histone domain. this results in a histone that is nearly three times the size of conventional histones  <cit> . the n-terminal third of macroh2a  shares 64% sequence identity with h2a, and the remaining two thirds of the protein shows similarity with the domain called 'macro'  <cit> . macroh2a is conserved throughout all vertebrate lineages, and two different members of the macroh2a family have been identified to date, macroh2a <dig> and macroh2a <dig>  <cit> . the macro domain functions as a strong transcriptional repressor by inhibiting the initiation step of pol ii transcription and by interfering with p300-dependent histone acetylation  <cit> . the macro domain is also capable of blocking the chromatin remodeling process mediated by swi/snf and acf  <cit> .

macroh2a is mainly associated with the heterochromatic regions of chromosomes. this is consistent with the observed repression activity. notably, early immuno-fluorescence studies revealed the enrichment of macroh2a <dig> deposition in the inactive x chromosome of mammals  <cit> , which undergoes chromosome-wide repression to balance different gene dosage between female and male  <cit> . macroh2a <dig> is also associated with other regions of heterochromatin, including peri-centromeric regions and senescence-associated heterochromatic foci  <cit> . another recent study revealed that high levels of macroh2a <dig> deposition are detected in methylated cpg islands that are located close to promoter regions  <cit> . in particular, macroh2a <dig> is highly enriched in the inactive, methylated alleles of imprinting control regions , which are shown to be critical for maintaining the imprinting  of surrounding genes  <cit> . although the mechanism targeting macroh2a <dig> to the icrs are not well understood at moment, the allele-specific deposition of macroh2a <dig> in the icrs represents another epigenetic marker besides dna methylation that differentiates two parental alleles.

to characterize potential roles of macroh2a <dig> in genomic imprinting, the current study has analyzed several imprinted domains with a major focus on the peg <dig> domain, an evolutionarily well-conserved domain located in human chromosome 19q <dig> /proximal mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this domain contains  <dig> imprinted genes within a 500-kb genomic interval, including paternally expressed peg <dig>  usp <dig> and zfp <dig>  and maternally expressed zim <dig>  zim <dig> and zim <dig>  we have generated several stable cell lines showing low levels of macroh2a <dig> using neuro2a cells and analyzed changes in the expression levels of imprinted genes. the results indicate that a subset of imprinted genes, including peg <dig> and usp <dig>  were affected by lowering the cellular levels of the macroh2a <dig> protein. furthermore, the expression of these genes were further repressed, rather than de-repressed, in response to the knockdown of the potential repressor macroh2a <dig>  this suggests that macroh2a <dig> may not function as the dominant repressor for the transcription of imprinted genes.

RESULTS
macroh2a <dig> knockdown stable cell lines
to investigate potential roles of macroh2a <dig> in genomic imprinting, we decided to lower the cellular levels of macroh2a <dig> using sirna techniques and to analyze functional outcome of this knockdown. we designed four sirna constructs using the psicor vector system  <cit> , and tested the efficacy of these constructs by performing individual transient transfection and western blotting . despite several trials, however, this series of transient experiments were not successful mainly due to the relatively high levels and long half-life of the cellular macroh2a <dig> protein. thus, we decided to derive stable cell lines using these constructs. we transfected a pool of these four constructs into both nih3t <dig> and neuro2a cells along with pcdna <dig> /his/lacz vector  for g <dig> selection . we initially seeded about  <dig> single cells per each line, and successfully obtained  <dig> homogenous pools of single cell lines that still maintained the egfp expression  from both nih3t <dig> and neuro2a. however, we decided to analyze only the stable cell lines derived from neuro2a due to the following two reasons. first, neuro2a is a cell line with female and neuron cell origins, which is appropriate for our expression studies on imprinted genes with neuron specificity as well as xist with female specificity. second, we have been able to extract histones more consistently from neuro2a than nih3t <dig>  which is a crucial step for measuring accurate knockdown levels of macroh2a <dig>  out of  <dig> randomly chosen single cell lines, two cell lines  consistently showed the reduced levels of macroh2a <dig>  approximately  <dig> to 90% reduction. in contrast, the remaining two cell lines  did not show any change in the protein levels of macroh2a <dig>  therefore, two cell lines, # <dig> and # <dig>  have been selected for our following analyses.

we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments using the two macroh2a <dig> knockdown cell lines to test whether macroh2a <dig> is indeed depleted in the imprinting control regions  of several domains, which show high levels of macroh2a <dig> deposition  <cit> . according to several chip experiments using anti-macroh2a <dig> antibody, the deposition levels of macroh2a <dig> on icrs in the two stable cell lines were much lower than the levels detected in the positive control neuro2a cells . this confirms the depletion of macroh2a <dig> in most icrs in the two macroh2a1-knockdown cell lines. the growth and morphology of these stable cell lines appeared to be normal without any obvious abnormalities.

macroh2a <dig> knockdown effects on the transcription of imprinted genes
the potential effects of macroh2a <dig> knockdown on imprinted domains were investigated by analyzing the expression levels of several genes in the two macroh2a <dig> knockdown cell lines. for this series of experiments, we first isolated total rnas from  <dig> different cell lines: neuro2a with no transfection , transfection with the empty psicor vector , stable cell line # <dig> and # <dig>  the isolated rnas were reverse transcribed and analyzed with two independent experiments: rt-pcr with a fixed number of cycles, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> , and quantitative real time pcr . to normalize cdna amounts, three genes were selected as internal controls . we also monitored potential toxic and side effects of sirna experiments, such as interferon response, by checking the expression levels of four genes  .

in the peg <dig> domain, the expression of most resident genes except for zim <dig> was detected in the neuro2a-derived control and knockdown cell lines. the expression levels of peg <dig> and usp <dig> in the two macroh2a <dig> knockdown cell lines were lower than those in the two control cell lines . the results from qrt-pcr also derived a similar conclusion: the expression levels of peg <dig> and usp <dig> were decreased by  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold and  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold, respectively . this is an unexpected outcome given the prediction that macroh2a <dig> is a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . however, the expression levels of zim <dig> and zfp <dig> did not deviate significantly from those of the control cells , indicating that these two genes are probably not changed by macroh2a <dig> knockdown.

we also analyzed the expression levels of other imprinted genes, including gtl2/dlk <dig>  igf2/h <dig>  kcnq1/kcnq1ot <dig>  nesp/nespas, gnasxl, exon1a, and xist/tsix . these genes were analyzed with rt-pcr with a fixed number of cycles, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  after the normalization of cdnas with the three internal controls . the expression levels of gtl <dig>  h <dig>  kcnq <dig>  kcnq1ot <dig>  and tsix were relatively low in the neuro2a-derived cell lines, and thus we could not analyze the knockdown effects on these genes. the expression levels of igf <dig>  nesp and gnasxl in the two knockdown cells were lower than those in the two control cells, indicating potential knockdown effects on these genes. however, due to inconsistent expression levels of these genes in one of the control cells , we could not confirm the knockdown effects on these genes with statistical significance. in contrast, xist was highly expressed in neuro2a-derived cell lines, but showed a similar level of expression among all the cell lines analyzed . this indicates that macroh2a <dig> knockdown had no obvious effect on this locus. the expression levels of dna methyltransferases  were also analyzed in the macroh2a <dig> knockdown cells. dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a and dnmt3b were expressed at a similar level in both controls and macroh2a <dig> knockdown cells, showing that macroh2a <dig> knockdown had no effect . in conclusion, our analyses indicate that the expression levels of two genes located in the peg <dig> domain were down-regulated in the macroh2a <dig> knockdown cells.

macroh2a <dig> knockdown effects on the dna methylation of imprinted genes
since two genes in the peg <dig> domain were repressed in the knockdown cell lines, we investigated if dna methylation was involved in this repression. we analyzed the dna methylation status of several promoters of genes in the peg <dig> domain using the combined bisulfite restriction analysis   <cit>  . genomic dnas from the control and macroh2a <dig> knockdown cell lines were isolated, treated with bisulfite, and finally amplified with specific primer sets designed for bisulfite-converted dnas. to monitor the efficiency of the conversion reaction, each pcr product was first digested with one of the following restriction enzymes, hpaii, and ddei, the recognition sites of which contain a cytosine base . digestion of an amplified product by either one of these enzymes indicates inefficient conversion reaction in a given trial. as shown in fig.  <dig>  however, none of products were digested, confirming successful conversion by our bisulfite treatment.

to determine the methylation status of promoter regions, we subsequently digested each pcr product with a second series of enzymes that can differentiate methylated and unmethylated dnas, including hpai, taqi, hpy188i, and ecorv . digestion of each amplified product with one of these enzymes indicates dna methylation, whereas non-digestion indicates that the tested dna is unmethylated. as shown in fig.  <dig>  all the tested promoter regions within the peg <dig> domain derived an equal ratio of methylated to unmethylated dnas in all the cell lines tested. this is an expected outcome given that only one of two parental alleles of these regions is usually methylated in vivo . however, we did not find any difference between the dna methylation levels of the control and knockdown cell lines, suggesting that dna methylation status of the promoters located in the peg <dig> domain was not changed in the macroh2a <dig> knockdown cell lines. this is also true for the xist promoter . overall, our dna methylation analyses indicate that macroh2a <dig> depletion did not cause any change in the dna methylation status of imprinted domains.

discussion
the current study demonstrates that lowering the macroh2a <dig> protein levels affects the expression levels of a subset of imprinted genes, including peg <dig> and usp <dig>  interestingly, the expression of these genes was repressed, rather than de-repressed, in response to the knockdown of the potential repressor macroh2a <dig>  subsequent analyses also revealed that macroh2a <dig> knockdown did not change the dna methylation status of their promoter regions. this suggests that macroh2a <dig> may not function as a dominant repressor for the transcription of these imprinted genes.

the down-regulation of a subset of imprinted genes, peg <dig> and usp <dig>  in macroh2a <dig> knockdown cells is an unexpected outcome since several lines of evidence strongly suggest a repressor role for this histone variant  <cit> . according to the results from a previous study  <cit> , macroh2a <dig> is deposited mainly on the inactive allele of the promoter region of peg <dig> and usp <dig>  suggesting a potential role in the inactive allele of this imprinted domain. rnai-based knockdown indeed depleted macroh2a <dig> from the inactive allele of peg <dig> and usp <dig> as shown in fig. 1b. despite this depletion, however, the inactive allele of the two genes was still methylated at similar levels between the control and knockdown cells . this suggests that macroh2a <dig> knockdown does not have any impact on the methylation levels and subsequently silent state of the inactive allele. nevertheless, the expression levels of peg <dig> and usp <dig> were down-regulated in the macroh2a1-knockdown cells . since macroh2a <dig> is mainly associated with the inactive allele, the transcription status of which is unaffected in the knockdown cells, the observed down-regulation is likely caused by some changes that have occurred in the active allele. it is, therefore, most likely that the observed effect on peg <dig> and usp <dig> in the knockdown cells is an indirect outcome involving other unknown components at their active alleles.

despite the high levels of macroh2a <dig> deposition in the icrs of most known imprinted domains  <cit> , only two imprinted genes, peg <dig> and usp <dig>  are affected in the macroh2a1-knockdown cell lines. this unexpected outcome is also similar to the results from the macroh2a1-deficient mouse  <cit> . depletion of macroh2a <dig> appears to have affected the transcription of only a small number of genes, about  <dig> genes, although macroh2a <dig> has been predicted to be a global regulator. out of  <dig> genes, some were also down-regulated, indicating another indirect effect similar to that seen in the macroh2a1-knockdown cells. since yy <dig> is known to be involved in the transcription of the two imprinted genes, peg <dig> and usp <dig>  <cit> , we first analyzed the macroh2a1-knockdown effects on the expression levels of yy <dig> to obtain potential clues regarding the down-regulation of peg <dig> and usp <dig>  however, we did not observe any change in the expression level of this potential candidate . we also examined the list of genes that were affected in the macroh2a1-deficient mouse  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes affected by macroh2a <dig> knockout, the transcription factor usf <dig>  is one likely candidate that was shown to be down-regulated in the macroh2a1-knockout mouse. this transcription factor deserves to be studied further in the near future, since it is known to interact or compete with yy <dig> for binding to dna elements  <cit> . it is plausible that macroh2a <dig> knockdown might have down-regulated the transcription of peg <dig> and usp <dig> through other unknown transcription factors like usf <dig>  overall, the results described above suggest that macroh2a <dig> may be involved in the fine tuning of transcriptional control of a subset of genes, but not as a global regulator.

mammalian imprinted domains are usually co-regulated through a small number of controlling regions, called icrs  <cit> . similarly, within the peg <dig> domain, the surrounding regions of peg3's 1st exon, termed the peg3-dmr, are predicted to control the whole domain . this potential icr is characterized by high levels of macroh2a <dig> deposition as well as an unusual tandem array of yy <dig> transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . interestingly, independent knockdown experiments targeting macroh2a <dig> and yy <dig> both appear to have resulted in similar global changes in the transcriptional levels of most imprinted genes in this domain. the two imprinted genes of the peg <dig> domain displayed a down-regulation in response to the macroh2a <dig> knockdown, although this down-regulation appears to be an indirect outcome. also, lowering the cellular level of the yy <dig> protein has resulted in up-regulation of most of the imprinted genes within the peg <dig> domain  <cit> . although opposite, these similar global responses are consistent with the prediction that the imprinting and transcription of this domain is linked together and regulated by a shared mechanism, possibly through the peg3-dmr.

CONCLUSIONS
rnai-based macroh2a <dig> knockdown experiments in neuro2a cells changed the expression levels of a subset of genes, including peg <dig> and usp <dig> of the peg <dig> domain. the expression of these genes was down-regulated, but not up-regulated, in response to reduced protein levels of the potential repressor macroh2a <dig>  this down-regulation was not accompanied with changes in the dna methylation status of the peg <dig> domain. thus, it is likely that macroh2a <dig> may not function as a transcriptional repressor for this domain, but that macroh2a <dig> may participate in the heterochromatin formation with functions yet to be discovered.
