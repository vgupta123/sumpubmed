BACKGROUND
maintenance of blood brain barrier  integrity is critical to prevent the passage of potentially harmful factors, such as pathogens or toxins into the brain. during the progression of central nervous system  infectious disease, pathogens might gain access to the brain by compromising the integrity of the bbb. in the course of aids, hiv enters the brain at early stages, disrupting the components of the bbb resulting in a chronic state of inflammation known as hiv encephalitis   <cit> . hive is characterized by the presence of hiv-infected microglia and / or macrophages in the brain, the formation of multinucleated giant cells and microglial nodules, astrogliosis and myelin pallor, the combined effects of which could result in cognitive impairment  <cit> . because endothelial cells of the bbb provide the first point of contact between blood-borne viral products and the brain, they provide the front line of defence against viral entry into the cns. alterations in signalling between components of the bbb with either hiv proteins or factors produced in response to hiv infection, such as cytokines and chemokines, may disrupt bbb integrity, resulting in a compromise that could promote transmigration of activated monocytes or hiv infected cells into the brain. toxic viral products released by hiv-infected cells such as, gp <dig>  tat or nef, together with cytokines and chemokines from activated monocytes, can act to increase bbb permeability  <cit> .

cell-free gp <dig> is found in the serum of hiv infected patients and crosses the bbb by absorptive endocytosis  <cit>  and has been detected in the perivascular regions of the brain  <cit> . gp <dig> is toxic to uninfected cells such as cerebral endothelial cells  <cit> , and induces numerous signalling alterations in glial cells leading to indirect neuronal dysfunction and death  <cit> . huang et al. have shown that gp <dig> promotes apoptosis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells  by acting through cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> chemokine receptors to increase activation of protein kinase   <cit> . furthermore, these studies show that the toxic effects of gp <dig> were blocked by pkc antagonists, sphingosine, phorbol esters and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>   <cit> .

while viral products and inflammatory response proteins may damage components of the bbb, other factors, such as growth factors, may work to preserve bbb integrity through maintaining endothelial cell fitness. in this context, fgf <dig> is of particular interest for several reasons. first, fgf <dig> is produced primarily by astrocytes that are in proximity to cerebral endothelial cells in the blood brain barrier  <cit> . among the known astrocyte-derived growth factors, only fgf <dig> mimics the signalling actions of astrocytes to the bbb  <cit> . second, of the four fgf receptors , fgfr <dig> is mainly expressed on neurons and endothelial cells while fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> are found on glial cells  <cit> . fgf <dig>  which binds to fgfr <dig>  exhibits a wide range of angiotrophic effects  <cit>  and promotes the survival of cortical and hippocampal neurons  <cit> . third, fgf <dig> signals through fgfr <dig> and activates phosphoinositol  <dig> kinase , protein kinase c , extracellular regulated kinase , and p <dig> pathways  <cit> . both erk and p <dig> belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase  signalling pathways and have been shown to be involved in regulating endothelial cell survival  <cit> . fgf <dig> protection of huvec from gp <dig> is proposed to occur by preventing the gp120-mediated increase in pkc activity  <cit> , however, protective signalling mechanisms directly induced by fgf <dig> have not been addressed. therefore, we investigated the signalling pathways involved in fgf2-mediated protection against gp <dig> toxicity in huvec. our studies indicate that fgf <dig> protects endothelial cells from gp120-mediated toxicity by crosstalk among several signalling pathways downstream of the tyrosine kinase fgfr. these pathways include, the erk, pi3k/akt and pkc signalling cascades. likewise, other studies have suggested that signalling pathways that inhibit cell death  and survival pathways  may represent the next investigational step in inhibition of hiv-related cns toxicity  <cit> . in this context, fgf2-mediated signalling may play an important role in maintaining bbb integrity during hiv trafficking into the brain and/or cell-free gp <dig> interactions with cerebral endothelial cells.

RESULTS
fgf <dig> protects endothelial cells from gp120-mediated toxicity
consistent with previous reports  <cit> , our results showed that gp <dig>  increased cell death of huvec above control by approximately  <dig> %  after  <dig> h exposure  as determined by trypan blue exclusion, tunel, and fa/pi staining . however, cells pre-treated with fgf <dig>  for  <dig> h and then exposed to gp <dig> displayed essentially the same percentage of cell death as untreated control cells . although fgf <dig> treatment of huvec most likely improved overall cell fitness  <cit> , no significant differences in the total numbers of cells  or in cell viability were observed between control and fgf <dig> treated cultures . furthermore, time course experiments indicated that simultaneous treatment  or pre-treatment with fgf <dig> up to  <dig> h was effective at protecting cells from gp <dig> toxicity . these results indicate that fgf <dig> is protective against gp120-mediated toxicity in huvec.

fgf <dig> activates erk in huvec
to explore mechanisms involved in the angio-protective effects of fgf <dig> against gp <dig>  we first investigated fgf2-stimulated signalling mechanisms that are involved in cell survival pathways. the binding of fgf <dig> to its receptor  induces several signalling cascades, such as mapk-mediated erk activation and akt-mediated gsk3β inactivation, both of which regulate cell survival. we first determined the effects of fgf <dig> stimulation on phosphorylation of erk and gsk3β in time course experiments in huvec . western blot analysis showed that huvec treated with fgf <dig>  resulted in maximum erk phosphorylation 5– <dig> min after stimulation , followed by a progressive decrease reaching undetectable levels at  <dig> min , with no effect on levels of total erk . neither gsk3β  nor pkc  phosphorylation was affected by fgf <dig> treatment.

to test the specificity of fgf <dig> on signalling, huvec were exposed to pharmacological inhibitors for pi3k , erk , and pkc  for  <dig> min prior to fgf <dig> treatment . erk phosphorylation was inhibited by blocking erk and pkc . interestingly, blocking the pi3k/akt/gsk3β pathway resulted in a dramatic increase in erk phosphorylation . neither fgf <dig> nor inhibitors affected levels of total erk . with regard to gsk3β, blocking pi3k with ly <dig> and pkc with bis i or gö <dig> also inhibited gsk3β phosphorylation , albeit to a lesser degree. treatment with the erk inhibitor u <dig> increased gsk3β phosphorylation . neither fgf <dig> nor inhibitors affected total levels of pi3k or gsk3β . these inhibitor studies suggest that fgf <dig> signalling involves crosstalk between pi3k/akt/gsk3β and erk that is possibly mediated by pkc .

to further confirm that these changes in kinase signalling are mediated by fgf <dig>  immuno-complex kinase assays were performed . as indicated by an astrisk  in fig. 4a, lane  <dig>  fgf <dig> treatment increased erk activity significantly above levels observed in un-treated control cells . likewise, and as shown in figure  <dig>  fgf2-mediated erk activity was significantly greater than control in the presence of the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> . the erk inhibitors pd and u <dig>  and the pkc inhibitors bis i and gö <dig> significantly blocked fgf2-mediated erk activity  as shown in figure  <dig>  conversely, fgf <dig> alone or in the presence of the inhibitors ly <dig>  bis i and gö <dig> had minimal effects on gsk3β activity . however, the erk inhibitor u <dig> significantly decreased gsk3β activity . pd <dig> also decreased gsk3β activity although at statistically insignificant levels . cell viability was not significantly affected by fgf <dig> or inhibitor treatments  ensuring that effects of inhibitors on kinase activity were not due to cell death.

taken together these data show that fgf <dig> activates erk signalling in huvec but has little effect on gsk3β activity unless fgf2-mediated erk phosphorylation is blocked. furthermore, independently of fgf <dig>  pi3k/akt and pkc signalling is necessary for gsk3β phosphorylation. however, once gsk3β is phosphorylated, the kinase activity of gsk3β is independent of pi3k/akt and pkc downstream signalling. on the other hand, gsk3β phosphorylation is influenced, to some degree, by fgf2-mediated erk phosphorylation since blocking erk phosphorylation results in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of gsk3β. likewise, the kinase activity of gsk3β also appears to require erk phosphorylation for maximal activation. in summary, the fgf2-mediated kinase activity of erk and gsk3β appears to involve crosstalk between these pathways and possibly pkc. the potential roles of erk and gsk3β phosphorylation and activity in fgf2-mediated protection from gp <dig> were investigated.

fgf <dig> angioprotection in huvec against gp <dig> toxicity is mediated, in part, by erk signalling
to investigate the potential role of erk and pi3k/akt/gsk3β signalling in fgf2-mediated angioprotection against gp <dig>  huvec were treated with ly <dig>  u <dig>  bis i, or gö <dig> for  <dig> min prior to fgf <dig> and gp <dig> exposure . results from cell toxicity assays determined by trypan blue exclusion , support our previous data  showing that exposure to gp <dig> alone significantly increased cell death above control and fgf <dig> treated cells; whereas, cells pre-treated with fgf <dig> before exposure to gp <dig> were protected . the protective effects of fgf <dig> against gp <dig> were significantly blocked by u <dig>  which inhibits mek to block erk phosphorylation, . blocking pi3k with ly  <dig> partially blocked fgf <dig> protection, although at levels insignificant from control. fgf <dig> protection from gp <dig> was not affected by blocking pkc with bis i or gö <dig> . treating cells with u <dig> to block erk phosphorylation, and gp <dig> in the absence of fgf <dig> resulted in significant cell death compared to untreated cells . moreover, pre-incubation of fgf <dig> with anti-fgf <dig> antibody completely neutralized fgf2-mediated angioprotection against gp <dig> . these results indicate that erk phosphorylation is significantly involved in fgf2-mediated angioprotection from gp <dig>  pi3k/akt/gsk3β signalling is partially involved in fgf <dig> protection from gp120; whereas, pkc signalling in the presence of fgf <dig> is not necessary for protection from gp <dig>  these results suggest that fgf <dig> protects endothelial cells from gp <dig> largely by erk stimulation with a partial contribution by gsk3β phosphorylation.

to further confirm the contribution of these signalling pathways in fgf <dig> protection against gp <dig>  huvec infected with caerk or caakt were exposed to gp <dig> and assayed for cell viability. as expected, endothelial cells infected with caerk and exposed to gp <dig> were significantly protected from gp <dig> toxicity . caakt conveyed only partial protection from gp <dig> toxicity, less than either caerk or fgf <dig> treatment . in control experiments where huvec were infected with gfp adenovirus, no protective effects against gp <dig> were observed . furthermore, none of the adenoviral constructs alone promoted significant cell toxicity . in agreement with our previous data, these results suggest that erk activation plays a significant role in protection of endothelial cells from gp <dig>  and akt/gsk3β is also be involved.

to confirm that the gene transfer approach resulted in erk and akt phosphorylation and kinase activation, western blot  and immuno-complex assays  were performed. erk kinase activity was detected using an antibody that recognizes only the phosphorylated form of erk1/ <dig>  consistent with our previous experiments , fgf <dig> stimulation resulted in an increase of both erk <dig>  and erk <dig>  phosphorylation . levels of fgf2-mediated phosphorylation of erk <dig> were greater than erk <dig> . infection with the gfp adenoviral construct alone had no effect on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation . in contrast, infection with caerk resulted in a significant increase in erk <dig> phosphorylation with no effect on erk <dig> . fgf <dig> treatment in combination with caerk induced high levels of erk <dig> phosphorylation with only moderate increases in erk <dig> phosphorylation . these results indicate that fgf <dig> stimulation results in phosphorylation of mainly erk2; whereas gene transfer of caerk or the combination of fgf <dig> and caerk mainly increased erk <dig> phosphorylation. importantly, total erk activity levels were similar in caerk with or without fgf <dig> . moreover, the level of protection conveyed by fgf <dig> alone was similar to protection by caerk or caerk plus fgf <dig> 

on the other hand, caakt alone had no effect on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation , whereas, fgf <dig> treatment in combination with caakt  had similar effects on erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation as observed with fgf <dig>  alone or with gfp and fgf <dig> . levels of total erk were not affected by fgf <dig>  gfp, caerk or caakt . infection of huvec with caakt resulted in a slight increase in baseline levels of akt phosphorylation . levels of total akt were not affected by fgf <dig>  gfp, caerk, or caakt . consistent with western blot analyses, immunocomplex assays show that caerk and/or fgf <dig> increased levels of erk activity , whereas neither caakt nor gfp resulted in increased erk activity in the absence of fgf <dig> .

results from inhibitor studies  and gene transfer experiments  suggest that both erk and pi3k/akt  are involved in fgf2-mediated protection against gp <dig> toxicity. furthermore, blocking the erk-mediated pathway results in an increase in gsk3β phosphorylation and vice versa: blocking the akt/gsk3β pathway after fgf <dig> stimulation results in an increase in erk phosphorylation. these results suggest that when endothelial cells are exposed to gp <dig>  fgf <dig> may mediate protection that involves crosstalk between the erk and pi3k pathways . moreover, inhibitor studies suggest pkc may be involved in this signalling convergence, but a direct role of pkc in fgf <dig> protection against gp <dig> is unclear.

pkc may be involved in crosstalk between erk and akt signalling pathways during fgf <dig> protection from gp120
our studies using pharmacological inhibitors suggest that pkc may be involved in a crosstalk mechanism observed between the erk and akt/gsk3β pathways in fgf <dig> signalling. for example, when huvec were exposed to pkc inhibitors bis i and gö <dig> prior to fgf <dig> treatment, erk phosphorylation was inhibited to below baseline levels, showing that fgf2-mediated erk phosphorylation is at least in part influenced by pkc phosphorylation . likewise, pkc inhibitors partially inhibited gsk3β phosphorylation after fgf <dig> stimulation . furthermore, since huang et al. have shown that total pkc phosphorylation increases with gp <dig> treatment in huvec and that fgf <dig> is protective  <cit> , we explored the possibility that similar crosstalk might be involved in the fgf2-mediated protection from gp <dig>  to address these signalling events, we determined which signalling pathways were initiated by fgf <dig> and which were initiated by gp <dig> 

to differentiate the effects of gp <dig> on erk, gsk3β and pkc phosphorylation from those obtained in fig.  <dig> where fgf <dig> alone was utilized, we treated endothelial cells with 1) gp <dig> alone , 2) gp <dig> in combination with inhibitors , and 3) inhibitors, fgf <dig> and gp <dig> . treatment of endothelial cells with gp <dig> alone  or with inhibitors alone  did not change levels of erk phosphorylation. however, when endothelial cells were treated with ly <dig> and then exposed to gp <dig> for  <dig> min, a significant increase in erk phosphorylation was observed . furthermore, in the presence of both fgf <dig> and gp <dig> and the inhibitor ly <dig>  erk phosphorylation also increased . interestingly, in the presence of the pkc inhibitor that includes inhibition of the ζ isoform , erk phosphorylation is returned to approximately control levels . on the other hand, inhibition of the classic isoforms of pkc, α, β and γ with bis i almost completely blocks erk phosphorylation in the presence of fgf <dig> and gp <dig> , as does inhibition of erk phosphorylation with u <dig> . these results suggest that pkc signalling may be involved in fgf2-stimulated erk phosphorylation that protects against gp <dig>  treatment of huvec with gp <dig> alone, or with gp <dig> and inhibitors to block erk, or pi3k/akt/gsk3β had little effect on gsk3β phosphorylation ; whereas, blocking pkc decreased levels of gsk3β phosphorylation . likewise, treatment of huvec with fgf <dig> alone or with fgf <dig>  gp <dig> and inhibitors to block pi3k/akt/gsk3β or erk had little effect on gsk3β phosphorylation ; whereas, blocking pkc decreased levels of gsk3β phosphorylation . in summary, in the presence of fgf <dig> and inhibitors for fgfr and pi3k/akt/gsk3β, erk phosphorylation increases . however, in the presence of fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> and inhibitors for pkc or erk, erk phosphorylation decreases . likewise, pkc inhibitors almost completely abolish gsk3β phosphorylation in the presence of gp <dig>  independently of fgf <dig> stimulation . together, these findings point to pkc involvement with fgf <dig> stimulated signalling in huvec during challenge with gp <dig>  however further experimentation is needed to confirm any role of pkc in fgf2-mediated protection from gp <dig> 

discussion
the present study is the first to show that fgf <dig> protects huvec against the toxic effects of gp <dig> via crosstalk of the erk-pi3k/akt pathways . consistent with these finding, fgf <dig> has been shown to protect endothelial cells from oxidative stress  <cit>  and radiation  <cit> . these studies suggest that pkc is involved in protection against ultra-violet radiation, since blocking pkc abrogates fgf2-mediated protection  <cit> . similarly, a recent study showed that fgf <dig> also protected endothelial cells from gp120-mediated toxicity that was induced by dysregulation of pkc activity to promote apoptosis  <cit> ; however, the pathways by which fgf <dig> protected endothelial cells from gp <dig> remained unclear and may be represented by independent mechanisms. therefore, our study focused on signalling pathways involved in angioprotection upon exposure to gp <dig>  gp <dig> has been reported to dysregulate pkc signalling but also to induce erk phosphorylation in several systems by different pathways  <cit> . likewise, our studies suggest that gp <dig> and fgf <dig> signalling in huvec may, in some aspects, overlap and involve primarily erk and to a lesser extent akt/gsk3β signalling. in this context, when huvec were treated with the erk inhibitor u <dig>  then exposed to gp <dig>  a significant increase in cell death above control was observed; however, the amount of cell death observed under these conditions was less than that observed in cells treated with gp <dig> alone. in huvec, pkc phosphorylation does not change when stimulated with fgf <dig> and pkc does not appear to be directly involved in fgf2-mediated protection from gp <dig> since inhibitors of this pathway had no effect on angioprotection. however, previous studies have shown that pck may play a role in the mapk signalling cascade, through upstream crosstalk with ras   <cit> . moreover, in the presence of gp <dig> with or without fgf <dig>  both erk and pkc inhibitors completely block erk phosphorylation, suggesting that while pkc is involved in erk phosphorylation, the protective properties of erk are not dependent on pkc. in support of these conclusions, the current study shows that inhibition of erk, and to a lesser degree pi3k/akt, blocks fgf2-mediated protection from gp <dig>  our data suggest that fgf <dig> signalling via erk-pi3k/akt crosstalk is responsible for protection of endothelial cells from gp <dig>  other mechanisms that could contribute to fgf2-mediated protection against gp <dig> may include, but are not limited to, interaction of fgf <dig> with heparin sulfate receptors and/or stimulation of alternative pathways not involving erk  <cit> .

consistent with these findings, fgf <dig> protects cardiac myocytes from inducible nitric oxide synthetase induced apoptosis by the erk signalling pathway  <cit> , and in neuronal cells fgf2-mediated erk activation is essential for survival signalling  <cit> . our studies provide evidence for the first time that fgf2-mediated protection of endothelial cells against gp <dig> toxicity largely occurs through an erk-dependent pathway. our data also suggest crosstalk between the pi3k/akt and erk pathways, since blocking pi3k resulted in a significant increase in erk phosphorylation in fgf <dig> treated endothelial cells. likewise, blocking erk caused an increase in phosphorylation of gsk3β, which is directly downstream of pi3k/akt signalling. in this context, it is possible that upon stimulation by growth factors such as fgf <dig>  endothelial cells utilize several signalling cascades that are capable of crosstalk to promote cell fitness and survival, as suggested by studies involving vascular endothelial growth factor  signalling in the presence or absence of serum  <cit> . in these studies, it was shown that crosstalk between the akt and p <dig> pathways may regulate cell survival during serum withdrawal and vegf stimulation  <cit> . our studies also point toward signalling crosstalk during fgf <dig> protection from gp <dig>  crosstalk between pi3k and p <dig> was shown to be mediated by mapk kinase kinase  in vegf signalling  <cit> . likewise, in fgf <dig> signalling, crosstalk between pi3k/akt and erk might be mediated by pkc  <cit> . this is consistent with previous studies showing that in vegf-stimulated endothelial cells, inhibition of pi3k resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . together with the findings in this study, these reports emphasize the importance of different signalling pathways communicating to regulate intracellular signal transduction in endothelial cell survival  <cit> .

the observations reported in this study have potential importance to the maintenance of bbb integrity in host response during hiv infection. fgf <dig> is produced by astrocytes in close proximity to endothelial cells of the bbb and functions to improve cell fitness and barrier integrity. in in vitro models of the bbb, fgf <dig> treatment of endothelial cells mimics the effects of astrocyte co-culture by improving tight junction integrity  <cit> . numerous studies have shown that disruption of this key component in the bbb is central to hiv infection of the cns and is a hallmark of hive  <cit> . this is particularly important during hiv trafficking into the cns because endothelial cells of the bbb are the first neural cells to come in contact with hiv infected cells or hiv products. regulation among signalling crosstalk in endothelial cells by fgf <dig> is important since these are the cells of the bbb that first encounter hiv-infected and/or activated cells and hiv products such as gp <dig>  migration of hiv-infected and/or activated cells into the brain is largely regulated by endothelial cell integrity. during the progression of hive, activated and hiv-infected monocytes produce cytokines and chemokines and release hiv products that act in concert to compromise the integrity of the bbb  <cit> . this triggers a series of signalling events that may result in the alteration of tight junction proteins, such as zona occludins, thereby promoting migration of hiv-infected cells into the brain parenchyma  <cit> . alternatively, astroglial cells that are also an important component of the bbb might produce trophic factors such as fgf <dig> in response to endothelial cell distress in attempts to maintain bbb integrity. among them, factors produced by damaged endothelial cells, including tissue factor, can induce the early growth response- <dig> gene  transcription factor in astrocytes that in turn directs expression of fgf <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study shows that fgf <dig> is protective against gp <dig> toxicity via crosstalk of erk-pi3k/akt signalling pathways during compensatory signalling. this finding is important for understanding the pathogenesis of hive because factors produced by components of the bbb, such as fgf <dig> by astrocytes, in response to toxins such as hiv-gp <dig> may be responsible in part for angio-protection of endothelial cells of brain microvasculature.
