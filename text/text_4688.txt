BACKGROUND
neuroblastoma is a childhood cancer arising from the sympaticoadrenal lineage of the neural crest. it is characterized by diverse clinical behaviours ranging from spontaneous regression, maturation to more benign forms , to rapid tumour progression and death  <cit> . amplification of the mycn oncogene has been considered the most important prognostic factor for progressive disease and poor outcome. despite intense efforts to elucidate a mechanism by which mycn overexpression acts to promote the aggressive phenotype, the functional roles of the mycn protein in neuroblastoma are poorly understood  <cit> .

several alternative mechanisms for neuroblastoma regression have been proposed over the past  <dig> years, although the principal mechanism underlying this peculiar phenomenon remains to be fully elucidated  <cit> . tumour maturation via neuronal differentiation has recently been proposed as a plausible candidate mechanism to explain neuroblastoma regression  <cit> . therefore, the study of neuroblastoma as a model system for the general process of tumour cell differentiation, as well as neuronal development, is important to reveal the secrets of both tumour maturation and spontaneous regression.

using neuroblastoma cell lines to study neuronal differentiation in vitro is now well established. induced neuron-like morphological and biochemical changes to the sh-sy-5y neuroblastoma cell line was demonstrated almost  <dig> years ago using a bioactive phorbolester as the inducing agent  <cit> . since then, a variety of various agents and growth factors have been shown to induce neuronal differentiation in many neuroblastoma cell lines . furthermore, specific suppression of mycn expression using traditional antisense techniques or small interfering rna molecules  have also been shown to promote neuronal differentiation in several mycn-amplified  neuroblastoma cell lines  <cit> .

plasmid and viral vector-based systems containing rna polymerase iii promoters for the expression of short hairpin rnas  have become useful tools for modulating gene expression in mammalian cells  <cit> . compared to sirnas, the use of shrnas to suppress gene function has been demonstrated to be more effective  <cit> . in addition, shrna-based strategies offer the advantage of inducible expression in situations in which gene knockdown is expected to have a deleterious effect on the targeted cell.

retroviral expression systems have proven to be useful tools for sustained long-term expression of transgenes in mammalian cells  <cit> . with the development of protocols to produce high-titer infectious, replication-incompetent retroviral particles, these expression systems are now commonly used for shrna delivery.

in this study, we have developed a retroviral tetracycline-inducible anti-mycn shrna expression system to study mycn knockdown-mediated neuronal differentiation in mna neuroblastoma cell lines. we reveal that mna neuroblastoma cell lines induced to express the anti-mycn shrnas efficiently undergo morphological and biochemical changes consistent with neuronal differentiation.

RESULTS
retrovirally delivered inducible shrna expression in hek293t-rex cells
we have previously developed and characterized an efficient doxycyclin -inducible variant of the h <dig> promoter  for shrna expression in human cells. the h1-2o2-us/ds promoter was shown to be almost completely inactive in the non-induced state, while induction by dox yielded a high shrna expression in transient transfection studies using an anti-luciferase  shrna reporter system  <cit> .

as a first step towards developing a long-term inducible shrna expression system, we subcloned the previously described anti-luc shrna constructs and the corresponding scrambled control shrna into a retroviral expression vector. shrna-expressing retroviruses were transduced into hek293t-rex cells followed by transient transfection of the luciferase reporter vector. two days after transfection, cells were monitored for dox-regulated shrna expression. addition of dox to the transduced cells had only minor effects on luciferase expression as can be seen from both the inducible scrambled negative control  and the h1-wt expressed anti-luc shrna  . induction of anti-luc shrna expression from the h1-2o <dig> promoter by the addition of dox downregulated the luciferase reporter to levels similar to that observed for the h1-wt promoter. at the same time, no transcriptional activity was observed in the non-induced state  when compared to the scrambled shrna control.

these data clearly show that retroviral delivery of the h1-2o <dig> us/ds-inducible shrna expression system to hek293t-rex cells allows an efficient inducible expression of mature shrna molecules.

efficient downregulation of mycn expression in mna neuroblastoma cell lines
we have previously designed an anti-mycn shrna construct  for downregulation of mycn oncogene expression in mycn-amplified  neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . this design procedure was based on the original hannon protocol for shrna construction, recommending  <dig> bp stem structures  <cit> . we have now constructed a new anti-mycn shrna construct  targeting the 3'utr of the mycn mrna.

the mna kelly and sk-n-be neuroblastoma cell lines were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing the amn- <dig> or amn- <dig> shrnas. a scrambled shrna  construct was used as the control. three days after transfection, cells receiving the amn  shrnas appeared to have a more neuron-like phenotype characterized by neurite outgrowth, while cells transfected with the control shrna did not reveal any morphological alterations as compared to non-transfected cells . western immunoblot and quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis confirmed specific suppression of the mycn protein and mycn mrna in both cell lines, respectively .

consistent with previous data, an inverse correlation between mycn and c-myc mrna expression was also confirmed   <cit> . the observed morphological changes were documented biochemically by increased expression of the early neuronal differentiation marker nfl . furthermore, expression of amn- <dig>  but not of amn- <dig>  resulted in a marked increase in the late neuronal differentiation marker gap <dig>  which is known to be involved in axonal outgrowth and synapse formation   <cit> . this observation is consistent with the more extensive neuronal differentiation observed for both kelly and sk-n-be cells transfected with amn- <dig> compared to cells transfected with amn- <dig> .

these data show that amn- <dig> is an efficient anti-mycn shrna construct which suppresses mycn expression and induces prominent neuronal differentiation in mna neuroblastoma cell lines. for that reason, the amn- <dig> shrna was used in the following research to knock down mycn expression.

previous reports document conflicting results on cell cycle distribution data of sk-n-be cells treated with anti-mycn sirnas. while yu et al. reported no apparent difference in the fraction of g <dig> cells after sirna treatment, bell et al. showed that mycn sirna treatment increased the g <dig> population by  <dig> % compared to a negative scrambled control sirna  <cit> . in order to investigate the effect of shrna-mediated mycn knockdown on the cell cycle distribution pattern, we transiently transfected sk-n-be cells with plasmids expressing the amn- <dig>  amn- <dig> or a scrambled shrna from a wt h <dig> promoter. three days posttransfection the cell cycle distribution pattern was monitored using flow cytometry. the fraction of cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle increased from 57%  to 74% for sk-n-be cells transfected with the amn- <dig> shrna . similar results were obtained with amn1658-transfected kelly cells .

a discrepancy between the knockdown levels for the mycn protein  and mrna  was observed in our mycn shrna knockdown experiments, with similar results being previously reported for mycn sirna knockdown by others  <cit> . in order to further document that only the expression of the mycn shrnas results in reduced mycn expression, we set up additional experiments. the complete mycn 3'utr sequence, including the amn- <dig> target sequence, was cloned behind a luciferase reporter gene in the pmir-report vector . co-transfecting this reporter vector and the amn-shrna expressing plasmids into hek- <dig> cells demonstrated the specific knockdown, monitored as an 80% reduction in luciferase activity, by the amn- <dig> shrna . when amn- <dig> was co-transfected with a control reporter vector containing a 3'utr lacking the amn- <dig> target sequence , no change in luciferase expression was observed, and similar results were obtained in the non-mna neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy-5y .

in addition, we co-expressed the amn-shrna constructs and the mycn cdna lacking the 3'utr sequence in a mna neuroblastoma cell line. downregulation of both the endo- and exogenously expressed mycn protein was only observed for the amn- <dig> shrna targeting the coding region of mycn. the amn- <dig> shrna was not able to suppress the exogenously expressed mycn cdna lacking the 3'utr structure .

these experiments show that the amn- <dig> shrna specifically reduces expression of mrnas containing the mycn 3'utr target. however, we have not been able to confirm or rule out the possibility that a part of the mycn protein reduction by amn- <dig> shrna knockdown is mediated by a mirna-like mechanism not involving mrna degradation. nonspecific cellular effects induced by shrna expression were excluded by showing that the expression level of several genes involved in the interferon response  remained unaltered during transfection of various shrna constructs .

retrovirally delivered inducible anti-mycn shrna expression in mna neuroblastoma cell lines
in order to generate a long-term inducible anti-mycn shrna expression system, we first cloned the amn- <dig> shrna module behind the inducible h1-2o2-us/ds promoter and then gated the resulting construct into a retroviral expression vector to generate prv- <dig>  a similar vector expressing a scrambled shrna was constructed as a negative control .

kelly and sk-n-be neuroblastoma cell lines stably expressing the tetr  were transduced with the retroviruses rv- <dig> and rv-scr and then incubated for  <dig> days in a growth medium both with and without dox. as can be seen from figure 4a and figure 4b, only the cells induced to express the amn- <dig> shrna demonstrated prominent neuronal differentiation. the lack of morphological changes in non-induced rv- <dig> transduced cells indicates that the h1-2o <dig> promoter shows minimal transcriptional leakage in the absence of dox. the addition of dox to rv-scr transduced cells had no significant effect on the cell morphology. western blot analysis of the retrovirally transduced kelly and sk-n-be cells revealed efficient repression of mycn expression in cells induced to express the amn- <dig> shrna . similar to the observations made in transient expression analyses, the mycn mrna levels were reduced to a lesser extent when compared to the western blot data .

in order to investigate the reversibility of the inducible retroviral shrna expression system, we performed a time-course experiment in which the amn- <dig> expression was turned on for  <dig> days before removing dox from the media for another  <dig> days to eliminate shrna expression.

compared to the differentiated cells continuously exposed to amn- <dig> shrna for  <dig> days, no significant change in cell morphology was observed when shrna expression was turned off . when the mycn protein and mrna levels were measured during the  <dig> days of shrna induction, a steady decrease in mycn expression was observed. removal of dox from the media after  <dig> days of exposure did not efficiently recover mycn expression. consistent with the observed neuron-like phenotype, gap <dig> protein levels remained high after dox removal .

by the use of a quantitative rt-pcr protocol designed to measure the mature antisense shrna strand, we observed a maximum 90-fold increase in amn- <dig> rna after  <dig> days of dox induction in the kelly cells . after additional  <dig> days of induction, a slight decrease in shrna expression was observed. for the sk-n-be cell line, a maximum 50-fold increase in shrna expression was observed after  <dig> days of continuous induction. removing the inducing agent from the media did not efficiently cease shrna expression. we suggest that this lack of reversibility is most likely due to high intracellular shrna stability and/or insufficient removal of dox from the media.

we also analysed the expression of the neuronal differentiation markers nfl and gap <dig> in kelly and sk-n-be cells transduced with shrna-expressing retroviruses. consistent with the observed morphological changes towards a neuronal phenotype, both differentiation markers increased upon amn- <dig> induction . quantitative real-time pcr revealed a 5- <dig> fold increase in nfl mrna and a 3-fold increase in gap <dig> mrna in both cell lines induced to express the amn- <dig> shrna.

sk-n-be has previously been described as a noradrenergic neuroblastoma cell line based on expression of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis  <cit> . in order to get further information about the neuronal phenotype observed in our experiments, we investigated the expression levels of the cholinergic markers choline acetyl transferase  and vesicular acetylcholine transporter , and the catecholaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase . when kelly and sk-n-be cells were induced to differentiate by mycn knockdown we observed increased mrna expression levels of chat and vacht. the mrna levels of th decreased during the same treatment . these data are consistent with a switch towards a more sympathetic cholinergic neuronal phenotype. a similar switch in neuronal phenotype, including increased npy expression, has previously been reported for a neuroblastoma cell line induced to differentiate by a combination of retinoic acid  and brain-derived neurotropic factor   <cit> . differentiated neuroblastoma tumours have recently been shown to have cholinergic characteristics as compared to poorly-differentiated or undifferentiated neuroblastomas  <cit> .

in summary, our data show that retroviral delivery of inducible anti-mycn shrnas to mna neuroblastoma cells efficiently reduces mycn protein expression and induces neuronal differentiation.

induced anti-mycn shrna expression inhibits cell proliferation and clonogenic growth of mna neuroblastoma cells
the alamar blue assay was used to measure cell proliferation in mna neuroblastoma cells induced to express the anti-mycn shrna from retroviral vectors. figure  <dig> shows that the rate of cell proliferation was selectively decreased from day  <dig> in sk-n-be and day  <dig> in kelly cells induced to express the amn- <dig> shrna. cells expressing the scrambled shrna showed no differences in cell proliferation due to the presence or absence of dox. the slight reduction in cell proliferation observed in the non-induced amn- <dig> transduced cells is most likely due to a small leakage from the shrna-expressing promoter. the delayed decrease in cell proliferation observed in kelly cells is consistent with the ~5-fold higher mycn mrna levels in comparison to mna sk-n-be  <cit> .

the observed reduction in the proliferation of cells induced to express the anti-mycn shrna was further investigated by flow cytometry in order to elucidate the cell cycle distribution pattern. induced mycn knockdown in the mna kelly cells increased the fraction of g <dig> cells from 63% to 72%. for the mna sk-n-be cells the fraction of g <dig> cells increased from 46% to 57% upon induction of amn- <dig> expression. additon of dox alone had no effect on the cell cycle distribution pattern in cells transduced with retroviruses expressing a scrambled shrna control .

finally, in vitro clonogenic assays were used to measure the reproductive cell survival in mna neuroblastoma cells induced to differentiate by mycn knockdown. figure  <dig> shows that mycn knockdown leads to dramatic growth inhibition only in mna neuroblastoma cells induced to express the anti-mycn shrna.

together, these data indicate that the induced expression of retrovirally delivered anti-mycn shrna inhibits cell proliferation by increasing the fraction of mna neuroblastoma cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. the clonogenic growth potential of these cells was also dramatically reduced.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed an efficient mycn-knockdown in vitro model system to study neuronal differentiation in mna neuroblastomas.
