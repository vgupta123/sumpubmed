BACKGROUND
the basidiomycete sclerotium rolfsii is a soilborne plant pathogenic fungus causing diseases in many agricultural and horticultural plants  <cit> . however, it is also used in biotechnology as a microbial platform for the production of the exopolysaccharide  scleroglucan. this polysaccharide is a water-soluble homopolymer composed of a -β-linked glucopyranose backbone with single -β-linked glucopyranosyl branches on every third subunit  <cit>  and traded under the commercial names tinocare® gl and actigum®. scleroglucan shows remarkable rheological properties rendering the substance as a multipurpose compound for many industrial applications, ranging from oil recovery over food industry to cosmetics and medical applications  <cit> . surprisingly, only very little information is available on the biosynthesis of scleroglucan formation by s. rolfsii  <cit>  whereas the physicochemical properties of scleroglucan are well explored  <cit> .

according to theoretical considerations put forward by sutherland  <cit> , scleroglucan synthesis follows the general scheme for polysaccharide production in microbial systems in three major steps: substrate uptake, intracellular formation and extrusion from the cell. uptake of glucose into the cell is mediated by glucose transporter, followed by phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate via a hexokinase reaction . after interconversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate by phospho-glucomutase , a utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase  activates glucose-1-phosphate to udp-glucose. a -β-glucan synthase  polymerizes the backbone chain using udp-glucose as monomeric precursor. the last step yielding to the -β branching at every third glucose molecule is supposed to be catalyzed by trans-d-glucosidases  <cit> . 14c incorporation experiments evidenced that the -β chain of scleroglucan is elongated toward the non-reducing terminus and that -β-linked glycosyl side residues are incorporated simultaneously as the -β-glucan backbone is elongated  <cit> .

several empirical studies have been performed to identify optimum medium composition for eps production by s. rolfsii  <cit> . interestingly, medium conditions favoring scleroglucan production have been reported to increase the amount of secreted oxalate as well  <cit> . the biosynthesis of scleroglucan has thus been proposed to be closely linked to the synthesis of oxalate; a reducing agent and strong acid involved in the infection process of s. rolfsii  <cit> . during industrial scleroglucan production, however, the formation of the by-product oxalate is undesirable as it lowers the productivity of the process and negatively interferes with downstream processing of scleroglucan  <cit> . for some of its applications, e.g. in cosmetics and food industry, a cost intensive removal of oxalate is necessary.

microbial oxalate is assumed to be synthesized in the glyoxylate cycle , which is the anaplerotic pathway during growth on c2-carbon sources. glyoxylate and succinate are the products of the isocitrate lyase reaction, and glyoxylate is either further oxidized to oxalate via the glyoxylate oxidase or used as precursor for malate synthesis. although for basidiomycetes the cellular role of oxalate is still not clarified, it has been reported to be important for free radical formation, iron and calcium chelation as well as pectin and cellulose hydrolysis  <cit> . in phytopathogenic fungi, oxalate has been described as a very important factor contributing to fungal virulence. one role of oxalate is to lower the ph of the ambient environment, resulting in increased fungal polygalacturonase activity necessary for plant cell wall degradation  <cit> . other roles include sequestration of calcium from cell walls, hydrolysis of plant pectin, suppression of plant defense responses and induction of the programmed cell death in plants  <cit> .

understanding the genetic basis for scleroglucan and oxalate biosynthesis is a prerequisite for the design of genetically engineered strains with improved scleroglucan yields. however, the genome of s. rolfsii has not been sequenced yet and dna sequences have been published for only a few s. rolfsii genes. to overcome this obstacle, we applied the massively parallel short-read  <dig> pyrosequencing technology to sequence the transcriptome of s. rolfsii. from the assembled and annotated unigene sequences, we predicted genes particularly involved in eps and oxalate metabolism. additionally, we performed a global suppression subtractive hybridization  approach to isolate and identify genes up-regulated under scleroglucan-producing conditions. we used the sequence data obtained from the  <dig> sequencing and from the ssh approaches to finally develop agilent microarray chips to perform comparative gene expression profiling for s. rolfsii grown in scleroglucan-producing and scleroglucan-nonproducing conditions and to identify genes differentially expressed under both conditions.

RESULTS
designing scleroglucan-producing and scleroglucan-nonproducing media
a basic requirement for this work was the development of two cultivation media for s. rolfsii, which should provide sufficient growth and a comparable biomass production, however with significant differences in eps production. in order to identify such media compositions, we used the synthetic eps medium proposed by farina et al  <cit> , and altered both the nature and concentration of the carbon  and nitrogen 2so4; 17- <dig> mm) sources. s. rolfsii was cultivated in these media and the formation of scleroglucan and oxalate was monitored over time . as shown in figure 1a, scleroglucan production was high in medium containing  <dig> mm glc and  <dig> mm nano <dig>  and lower in medium containing  <dig> mm fru and  <dig> mm nh4cl . at  <dig> h of cultivation, s. rolfsii produced scleroglucan in epsmax <dig> medium but to a slightly lesser extent in epsmin <dig> medium. sufficient amounts and significant differences in scleroglucan production are detectable after  <dig> h of cultivation, whereas biomass accumulation was comparable. we thus decided to choose the  <dig> h time point for the comparative analysis. interestingly, cultures of s. rolfsii grown in epsmax <dig> and epsmin <dig> media displayed similar ph and oxalate profiles, suggesting that oxalate production is rather coupled to growth and biomass formation than to scleroglucan synthesis .

 <dig> pyrosequencing and data analysis
total rna extracted from  <dig> h old cultures of s. rolfsii grown in epsmin <dig> and epsmax <dig> medium were pooled in a 1: <dig> ratio to guarantee equal predominance of both rna populations and subsequently reversed transcribed into cdna. the mixed cdna sample was sequenced by  <dig> life sciences™. the rationale behind combining both mrna populations was to increase transcriptome coverage. triplicate sequencing runs resulted in  <dig>  single reads composed of  <dig>  million bases . using the  <dig> life sciences™ newbler software, these reads were trimmed and assembled into  <dig>  contiguous sequences and  <dig>  singletons  and are later on referred to as unigenes. a complete list of all unigenes has been deposited at the ncbi sequence read archive  under accession number sra <dig> .

all unigenes obtained were functionally analyzed via the sequence analysis and management system . this software platform was originally developed to support the computational analysis of shotgun genome sequencing projects  <cit> . however, in addition to quality assessments, sams is well suited for the annotation of short sequence fragments and as an annotation pipeline also includes standard bioinformatics tools such as blast  <cit> . we thus used sams to analyze and functionally annotate the s. rolfsii unigenes. the analysis pipeline was set up with different blast tools and databases: blast2× versus the ncbi nr protein database , blast2× versus the kog protein database , blast2n versus the ncbi nt nucleotide database  and tblastx <dig> versus the ncbi nr/nt database, e-value cut-off of 10-5). the eukaryotic orthologous groups database  is essentially the eukaryotic version of the clusters of orthologous groups database .

a total of  <dig>  sequences were assigned to one or more kog functional categories. the remaining sequences were excluded by the chosen cut-off e value of 10- <dig>  to evaluate the completeness of the transcriptomic data collection, we searched the unigenes for the presence of genes predicted to function in four primary carbon metabolic pathways - glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tca and glyconeogenesis. annotated sequences were found for every step of the four pathways , suggesting that the transcriptomic library could represent a nearly complete sequence database for the s. rolfsii transcriptome. the annotated unigene functions cover a broad range of kog categories , with the majority of genes grouping into the metabolism category. among the functional kog categories, we were particularly interested in the categories 'carbohydrate transport and metabolism ' and 'energy production and conversion ' as they were supposed to contain unigenes which participate in scleroglucan and oxalate metabolism. an overview of all unigenes allocated into both categories is given in additional file  <dig>  from this list, unigenes were selected which could potentially be involved in each of the five steps of scleroglucan biosynthesis . surprisingly, only one potential candidate glycosyltransferase, presumed to catalyze the last step in scleroglucan synthesis, was identified. lacking more direct hits, we screened the complete  <dig>  singletons for the presence of a predicted glycosyltransferase unigene and retrieved one additional positive hit .

with respect to oxalate metabolism, we could retrieve matching unigenes for  <dig> out of  <dig> possible enzymatic reactions . as three hits potentially encode an oxaloacetate hydrolase  but none a glyoxylate oxidase , it can be suggested that the main route for oxalate synthesis in s. rolfsii is via oxaloacetate. this would be in good agreement with previous findings which demonstrated that the most important pathway leading to oxalate formation in asco- and basidiomycetes is catalyzed via an oxaloacetate hydrolase and thus solely depends on oxaloacetate as precursor and not on glyoxylate  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been reported for s. rolfsii that the enzyme glycolate oxidase  also accepts glyoxylate as substrate and oxidizes it to oxalate  <cit> . four contigs show considerable homology to glycolate oxidases , which thus could be candidate genes for such an enzyme.

→ summary of the s. rolfsii contigs giving at least one hit when analyzed with one of the four blast tools  to the enzymes catalyzing reactions 1- <dig> according to figure  <dig> 

in terms of oxalate degradation, no hits were identified for an oxalate oxidase  and an oxalate decarboxylase , but several unigenes matched a formate dehydrogenase . we propose two possible explanations for this finding. either the main pathway for oxalate degradation is still the oxalate decarboxylase -- formate dehydrogenase route but the oxalate decarboxylase gene was expressed on a very low level and therefore not found among the mrna population used for sequencing. or s. rolfsii does not use the oxalate decarboxylase -- formate dehydrogenase pathway for oxalate degradation and the formate dehydrogenase enzyme rather has a function in anaerobic respiration as shown for fusarium oxysporum  <cit> .

as the lack of detection for unigenes encoding for an oxalate oxidase and oxalate decarboxylase could be due to their low expression levels, we screened the genomic dna of s. rolfsii via pcr using primers designed from respective fungal and plant gene sequences . basically, either one of both enzymes have been reported to be present in basidiomycetes, e.g. an oxalate oxidase is crucial for lignin degradation by the white rot fungus ceriopsis subvermispora  <cit>  and a oxalate decarboxylase is important for the brown rot fungus flammulina velutipes for the survival under low external ph conditions  <cit> . all our pcr attempts to isolate a dna sequence encoding an oxalate degrading enzyme were only successful for an oxalate oxidase but not for an oxalate decarboxylase . we were able to isolate one dna fragment , which showed 32% similarity to the barley oxox gene, suggesting that the oxalate oxidase reaction is the likely oxalate degradation route in s. rolfsii.

comparative transcriptomics using suppression subtractive hybridization
we used a suppression subtractive hybridization  approach to isolate cdna species which are only present or enriched in s. rolfsii when grown in epsmax <dig> medium compared to epsmin <dig> medium. the advantage of the ssh approach is that also low abundant mrna species can be isolated. the mrna isolated from s. rolfsii cultivated for  <dig> h in epsmax <dig> medium was used as 'tester' and mrna isolated from  <dig> h old s. rolfsii cultures cultivated in epsmin <dig> medium served as 'driver'. a total of  <dig> transformants representing cdnas induced under scleroglucan-producing conditions were isolated.  <dig> of these clones were randomly selected and screened by reverse northern hybridization for differential expression .  <dig> of the  <dig> screened cdna clones showed considerable differences when hybridized with total cdnas from scleroglucan-producing and scleroglucan-nonproducing conditions, respectively, confirming that these genes are up-regulated during scleroglucan biosynthesis. the  <dig> differentially expressed cdnas were sequenced , analyzed via tblastx and assigned to their predicted functional activity within different biochemical pathways . in addition, the bioedit tool http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html was applied to blast and align the ssh unigenes against the  <dig>  contigs identified via  <dig> sequencing . for the majority of the ssh unigenes, we could identify homologous  <dig> unigenes .

* the dna sequences of all ssh unigenes are given in additional file  <dig> 

interestingly, we isolated not only genes predicted to function in scleroglucan and oxalate metabolism  but also genes known to play fundamental roles in primary metabolism. for example, pyruvate decarboxylase , isocitrate dehydrogenase , oxoglutarate dehydrogenase , acyl-coa-dehydrogenase  and glycogen phosphorylase  were among the predicted proteins.

comparative transcriptomics using agilent microarray hybridization
complementary to the ssh approach; we performed gene expression profiling to identify genes up- and down-regulated during scleroglucan-producing conditions. in order to manufacture respective agilent microarrays, ten different  <dig> bp long probes were designed  and in situ synthesized for all of the  <dig> and ssh unigenes . the specificity of the probes was analyzed in a test hybridization run using pooled cdna populations from s. rolfsii cultivated for  <dig> h in epsmax <dig> and epsmin <dig> medium . based on the results, two probes per unigene were selected for the design of agilent multiplex 44k arrays . the arrays were hybridized with s. rolfsii cdna, obtained from  <dig> h cultivations in epsmax <dig> and epsmin <dig> medium, respectively. hybridizations were performed in triplicate using mrna isolated from three independent cultures . after normalization based on quantiles, hybridization clustering experiments were performed to control both experimental conditions. based on this quality check, we had to exclude one of the triplicate samples from further analysis  as it did not cluster with the other two epsmin <dig> samples .

for the comparison of the epsmax <dig> triplicate versus the epsmin <dig> duplicate arrays, we used an arbitrary chosen fold change of  <dig> to define unigenes as differently expressed . applying this filter, expression of a total of  <dig> unigenes did significantly vary between both conditions, whereby  <dig> unigenes were up- and  <dig> down-regulated under epsmax <dig> condition when compared to the epsmin <dig> condition. a comprehensive list of all differentially expressed unigenes is depicted in the additional file  <dig>  as not all of the  <dig> unigenes displayed a kog annotation, we manually re-annotated this gene list using tblastx or blastn  and classified the predicted protein functions according to the functional catalogue   <cit> . we could thereby assign putative funcats to  <dig> unigenes, out of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in s. rolfsii when cultivated in epsmax <dig> medium .

the functional categories with the largest number of differently expressed unigenes are the categories 'metabolism' and 'transport' . among these are four unigenes which we had isolated via the ssh approach . the high fold change cut-off used for microarray analysis as well as the lower sensitivity of microarrays compared to ssh probably limited the amount of overlapping hits. nine unigenes predicted to encode polysaccharide-acting enzymes were up-regulated when s. rolfsii was cultivated in epsmax <dig> medium , thus representing potential candidate genes involved in scleroglucan elongation and branching. moreover, many up-regulated unigenes fall into the group of ergosterol and sphingolipid metabolic proteins . finally, various unigenes assigned to transporters  and oxidoreductases  displayed altered expression under epsmax <dig> conditions . these transcriptional changes could imply that scleroglucan synthesis might be coupled to the cellular ion homeostasis machinery. such a scenario would be in agreement with the overall concept that microbial eps production is also an adaptive response towards environmental salt and osmotic stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used different strategies to reveal genes involved in scleroglucan synthesis and oxalate metabolism of sclerotium rolfsii, a fungus that lacks a sequenced genome. in sum, three independent transcriptomic approaches were applied, which together uncovered candidate genes for each predicted step of scleroglucan synthesis, oxalate synthesis and oxalate degradation. many of these genes were unraveled in both global comparative transcriptomic analyses, making them as prime candidates for further analyses.

the insights into the genetics and transcriptome of scleroglucan synthesis obtained in this work are to our knowledge the first gained for any eps produced by a basidiomycete. the sequence data covers a nearly complete set of genes transcribed in s. rolfsii and provides an important resource for studying the biology and pathogenesis of s. rolfsii.
