BACKGROUND
in previous research, we detected endogenous dna double strand breaks  that occurred without inductive agents or dna replication and named them replication-independent edsbs  . the causes and consequences of rind-edsbs differ from those of replication-induced edsbs  <cit>  and irradiation-induced dsbs  <cit> . whereas irradiation-induced dsbs halt the cell cycle  <cit> , induce cell death  <cit>  and serve as mediators of mutation  <cit> , rind-edsbs do not. rind-edsbs are detectable in all human cell types  <cit>  as well as in yeasts  <cit> . the down-regulation or deletion of high mobility group genes in both humans and yeasts lowers rind-edsb levels  <cit> . the high mobility group genes are multifunctional genes that regulate multiple dna-dependent processes such as transcription, replication, recombination, and dna repair  <cit> . in conclusion, not only are rind-edsbs ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, but genes that maintain optimal levels of rind-edsbs also exist in cells. therefore, rind-edsbs are evolutionally conserved in eukaryotic cells and may possess particular essential functions .

we previously reported that rind-edsbs may help to maintain genomic integrity. firstly, rind-edsbs are linked to methylated cpg nucleotides  <cit> , and genomic hypomethylation is associated with genomic instability . consequently, fragile genomes exhibit low levels of dna methylation and also contain few rind-edsbs. secondly, rind-edsbs are preferentially retained in the heterochromatin and are unbound by γ-h2ax  <cit> . finally, when the number of rind-edsbs is reduced by trichostatin a, the number of γ-h2ax foci increases  <cit> . γ-h2ax foci are signals of pathologic dsbs  <cit> . this suggests that rind-edsbs may prevent unwanted dna breakage. interestingly, the generation of rind-edsbs can be discovered in cells lacking topoisomerase  <cit> . topoisomerase is involved in unwinding topological constraints by replication or transcription  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that rind-edsbs may help relieve dna tension during transcription to prevent unwanted dna breakage.

rind-edsbs do not result in mutations. we previously demonstrated that methylated rind-edsbs in human cells were repaired by a precise atm-dependent type of non-homologous end joining   <cit> , whereas unwanted dsbs were generally repaired by a faster, more-error prone ku-mediated type of nhej. a compact structure prevented h2ax phosphorylation, a conventional dsb repair response, which resulted in methylated rind-edsbs escaping error-prone nhej repair  <cit> .

we now hypothesize that rind-edsbs are not pathologic dna lesions and may have essential biological functions. consequently, rind-edsbs should not occur randomly in genomes. in this study, we examined the characteristics of yeast rind-edsbs. first, the dna sequences near the 3’ ends of rind-edsbs were amplified by ligation mediated pcr. next, the resulting pcr products were sequenced using high throughput sequencing. finally, these sequences were used to analyze the locations and sequences surrounding the rind-edsbs.

RESULTS
the rind-edsb pcr products were prepared by ligation mediated pcr. first, a “first linker” was ligated to the rind-edsbs. next, this ligated high molecular weight dna was digested by rsai, and the digested dna was ligated to “second linkers”. then, a pcr was performed using primer sets with 5’ linker sequences . theoretically, there were five types of pcr products .  products that contained both of the linkers and the intact sequence, with the 5’ end of the intact sequence next to the first linker being rind-edsbs.  products that contained the second linkers on both sides and the intact sequence, but no rind-edsbs.  products that contained both of the linkers and a sequence that was derived from multiple ligations.  products that contained only the second linkers and multiple ligations.  pcr products that were generated from nonspecific amplification due to the primers binding directly to the genome. these amplicons lacked the 3’ sequence of the first linker and contain no rind-edsbs.figure  <dig>

because there was heterogeneity in the origins of the pcr products, we performed multiple steps to screen out pcr products that were not rind-edsbs or multiple ligation products . the first step was trimming the linkers, which allowed us to categorize the pcr products and retain types  <dig> and  <dig> . in  <dig>  <dig> reads, there were  <dig>  <dig> reads lacking the first linker ,  <dig>  <dig> reads containing the first linker sequence but missing ten or more of the last bases  and  <dig>  <dig> reads containing both the first linker sequence and the last ten bases . next, from pcr product types  <dig> and  <dig>  we retained those reads having sequence lengths greater than  <dig> bases, and containing first linker sequences with  <dig> gaps and mismatches . this step yielded  <dig>  <dig> reads. then, using only sequences , the resultant reads were aligned to a by <dig> reference genome via blast . in total,  <dig>  <dig>  of these reads were mapped to the reference genome by blast. most of the sequences from the rind-edsb pcr products that were not mapped involved multiple ligations of rsai digested fragments . in the control group, approximately 86% of the reads were mapped . rsai cutting can yield small fragments. the smallest fragment size generated using rsai is four bases. the distribution of possible fragment sizes after applying rsai to by <dig> is shown in additional file 1: figure s2a and s2b. the most abundant fragment size was nine bases. however, if an rsai cut site happens to be located near rind-edsbs, it can produce fragment sizes smaller than four bases. the distribution of potential fragment sizes after applying rsai to by <dig>  assuming the existence of rind-edsbs at “acgt” sequences, is shown in additional file 1: figure s2c and s2d. the most abundant fragment size was  <dig> bases. these small fragments were ligated together randomly, thus producing reads that could not be mapped. however, multiple ligations did not interfere with the sequences with rind-edsbs at farther distances from rsai cut sites. using the blast results, we filtered out those reads that were not aligned from the first base , resulting in  <dig>  reads, where the two numbers in the parentheses are the number of uniquely mapped reads and multi-mapped reads, respectively. finally, we examined the reads that were mapped to multiple locations . the final number of reads analyzed was  <dig>  reads, where the two numbers in the parentheses are the number of uniquely mapped reads and multi-mapped reads, respectively. over 97% of the multi-mapped reads were retained for analysis.

distribution and number of rind-edsbs
we investigated whether the break positions had any relationship with chromosomal positions, e.g., with centromeric or telomeric regions. the alignment positions from blast corresponded to break positions; thus, we were able to observe the edsb distribution across all  <dig> chromosomes. in the wild type yeast cells,  <dig> uniquely mapped reads corresponded to  <dig> positions in the genome. that is, for some positions, multiple reads were mapped because they originated from a population of cells rather than from a single cell. figure  <dig> shows the  <dig> edsb positions. the height of each vertical bar corresponds to the number of reads aligned to that specific position. as shown in the figure, the break positions did not clump near the centromeres or the telomeres but were scattered across the chromosomes.

to see if the number of breaks correlated with chromosomal size, we plotted the number of breaks against the length of the chromosomes . the number of breaks increased nearly linearly with chromosomal size. the pearson correlation coefficient for this observation was  <dig> , and the p-value was  <dig> e- <dig> figure  <dig>

sequence patterns near break points
to explore whether specific sequence patterns existed near the breaks, we plotted sequence logos  of  <dig>  reads . in figure  <dig>  we observed a difference in the base frequency patterns between columns  <dig> to  <dig>  which spanned across the breakpoints. in other columns, we can see that the frequency of c is similar to that of g, the frequency of a is similar to that of t and the frequencies of c and g are generally lower than the frequencies of a and t. this is consistent with the proportions of a, c, g and t in the yeast genome, which are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows sequence logos where the column height is proportional to the information content. although the overall information content in each column is low, we can see that position  <dig>  located right before a breakpoint, has the highest information content, which indicates a lower tolerance for substitutions at this position compared with others.figure  <dig>

we next investigated whether break occurrences have specificities toward certain sequences. because base frequency patterns differ between columns 45– <dig>  we counted, in a wild type yeast sample, the number of stitched reads with base combinations and column positions as follows: “xxx▼x”, “xxxx▼”, “xxxx▼x”, “xxxx▼xx”, “xxxxxx▼”, “xxxxxx▼xx”, where x denotes a single base and “▼” denotes a break . we show the counts for each sequence pattern in additional file  <dig>  regardless of the sequence type, we observed a non-uniform distribution of counts where one base combination had the highest counts of all the base combinations. this highest count was for the “xxxx▼” combination compared with the “xxx▼x”, “xxxx▼x”, “xxxx▼xx”, “xxxxxx▼”, and “xxxxxx▼xx” combinations. this implies that the breaks were more likely to occur at certain sequences. to determine whether this sequence specificity was statistically significant, we performed a fisher’s exact test . of the  <dig>  <dig> stitched reads, we observed that  <dig> of them contained “acgt▼” at the breakpoints. in the by <dig> genome, we observed that “acgt” occurred  <dig>  <dig> times, whereas other 4-mer sequences occurred  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> times. the associated p-value was  <dig> e- <dig>  which was highly significant .table  <dig>

we further validated the non-random occurrence of “acgt▼” sequences using the simulations described in the methods section. in contrast with the observed data, the  <dig> sequence logos from the simulated data had no specific patterns in any of the columns. in every column of the logos, c and g, whose frequencies are approximately equivalent, have lower frequencies than a and t, which have similar frequencies. this frequency pattern is the same for all of the columns in the observed data, with the exception of the “acgt▼” columns. this further supports our conclusion of a nonrandom association of “acgt▼” sequences with breaks.

to examine whether the breaks were associated with other 4-mer sequences, we calculated a fisher’s exact test and an odds ratio for the other possible 4-mer sequences . the significant 4-mer sequences are shown in table  <dig>  in addition to “acgt▼”, the p-values of “tagt▼”, “cagt▼”, “tggt▼”, “tacc▼”, and “atat▼” were significant with non-zero odds ratios. we plotted the number of stitched reads with each possible 4-mer sequence preceding the breaks, “xxxx▼” , as well as the number of each 4-mer occurrence in the yeast genome . comparing the two figures clearly illustrates that the significant 4-mer sequences common in the reads were not predominant in the genome. these results lead us to conclude that rind-edsbs are more likely to occur at specific sequence patterns.figure  <dig>

to determine if multi-mapped reads influenced the break preference at “acgt”, we retained uniquely mapped reads only  and counted all of the possible 4-mer sequence of “xxxx▼” in the stitched reads as we had done previously. the breaks generally occurred before “acgt▼” as they had before .table  <dig>

we also tested whether our pcrs and/or methodology generated any artifacts resulting in biased results by using alui digested dna as a control . almost all of the cut sites in the pcrs at both  <dig> and 60 cycles were expected, that is, we observed “ag▼ct” in our stitched reads . therefore, it is unlikely that our rind-edsb results were biased.table  <dig>

in conclusion, the most frequent sequence before breaks was observed to be “acgt”, which had an exceptionally high odds ratio . moreover, there were additional 4-mer sequences that occurred frequently with odds ranging from  <dig> - <dig> . this group of 4-mers often contained “gt” before breaks. conversely, some 4-mer sequences had odds of zero . these 4-mer sequences were never observed in the reads. when these zero odds 4-mers are put together, the p-value is extremely significant . this finding demonstrates that break occurrences exhibit sequence specificity, i.e., there are no breaks at these 4-mer sequences. the number of 4-mer sequences with no breaks was not trivial .figure  <dig>

discussion
we postulated that rind-edsbs have an important function in cells, and therefore their occurrence is nonrandom. in this study, we examined the characteristics of rind-edsbs to determine if rind-edsbs occur systematically. we found that breaks were scattered along chromosomes and that the number of breaks and chromosomal size were positively and almost linearly correlated. most importantly, the breaks occurred most frequently after the sequence “acgt”.

rind-edsbs are evolutionarily conserved, i.e., they are present in both the human and yeast genomes. in addition, there are lower numbers of rind-edsbs in yeast cells depleted of nhp6a. these same results occurred in human cells lacking hmgb <dig>  the human homolog of nhp6a  <cit> .

we speculate that there is a specific mechanism for the occurrence of rind-edsbs; however, this mechanism remains unknown. it might resemble the mechanism used by restriction enzymes to recognize and cut a specific nucleotide sequence or it might depend on the physical properties of dinucleotide sequences. the specificity of “acgt” was not a coincidence because “acgt” was ranked number  <dig> out of  <dig> with respect to “xxxx” abundance in the genome. in addition, its sequence logo implied that breaks preferred regions where a cg dinucleotide was in the neighborhood of an a or t. in other words, the physical properties of the cg dinucleotide in the acgt sequence are distinctive from the physical properties of the surrounding nucleotides. it is unlikely that the mechanism is dependent on chromosomal location because we observed that break locations were scattered across chromosomes, suggesting that there are distinct rind-edsb locations in each cell. because rind-edsbs have been conserved from yeasts to humans, the mechanism by which rind-edsbs are produced should have been conserved as well.

rind-edsbs are potential epigenetic marks. epigenetic marks require two properties. firstly, they must be associated with a non-random underlying mechanism. for example, dna methylation is specific to the cytosine in cpg dinucleotides due to the dna methyltransferase function  <cit> . secondly, an epigenetic mark must specifically function to control gene expression or affect genomic integrity. for example, methylation in promoter suppressed gene expression  <cit> , intragenic line- <dig> hypomethylation reduced gene expression  <cit> , and hypomethylation can all lead to genomic instability  <cit> . due to the conservation of rind-edsbs in every cell from yeasts to humans, we deduced that a specific mechanism must exist to produce rind-edsbs. moreover, in human cells, γ-h2ax, which is a marker of abnormal dna breakage, was up-regulated when concentrations of rind-edsbs were reduced  <cit> . when hmgb <dig> was depleted, the levels of rind-edsbs decreased, suggesting a role for hmgb <dig> in maintaining rind-edsbs  <cit> . a yeast strain lacking the genes involved in generating dsbs, e.g., topoisomerases or endonucleases, had an increased level of rind-edsbs  <cit> . this implies that there is a compensatory mechanism for the loss of the functions of certain topoisomerases or endonucleases, and indicates a potential role for rind-edsbs. here in this study we proved that rind-edsb occurring non-randomly implying the association with a non-random underlying mechanism. therefore, we provided additional information to support that rind-edsbs are epigenetic marks.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we found that rind-edsbs were location-independent and tended to occur immediately after the sequence “acgt”. this finding suggests that rind-edsb production is regulated by a non-random mechanism. the fact that rind-edsbs have a specific mechanism and are retained for a specific function signifies that rind-edsbs are epigenetic marks.
