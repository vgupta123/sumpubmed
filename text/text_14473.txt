BACKGROUND
ramie  produces one of the strongest and longest plant fibers that are used for clothing fabrics, industrial packaging, twines, cordages, canvas, car outfits, etc. however, despite excellent properties and diverse applications, ramie has failed to become a major textile crop mainly due to difficulties in processing the fiber. natural ramie fibers contain gum-like material that has to be removed before most application. the conventional degumming process is performed with alkaline treatment at high temperature, which causes fiber damage while increasing energy consumption and severe environmental pollution.

pectate lyases are a group of enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of α- <dig>  4-glycosidic bond of pectin polymer. in industry, these enzymes, combined with other enzymes, can be used to efficiently remove ramie gum under mild conditions so that the use of harsh chemicals can be significantly reduced  <cit> . hence, enzymatic degumming can serve as a good alternative to conventional degumming method, with a decreased environmental pollution and energy consumption as well as an improved yield and quality of degummed ramie  <cit> . for enzymatic degumming of fibers at an industrial scale, it is important to produce cost-efficient, effective and cellulase-free pectate lyase.

pectate lyases have been isolated from various microbial sources such as yeasts, actinomycetes, bacteria and fungi. in application, alkaline pectate lyase is preferred for efficiently removing pectin from ramie, since pectin is more soluble in alkaline solution. alkaline pectate lyases are produced predominantly by the genus bacillus  <cit> . however, bacillus is not a suitable host for pectate lyases during the degumming process since most bacillus produce cellulases endogenously with a detrimental effect to the fiber. in contrast, p. pastoris has no endogenous cellulases expression and secrete heterologous proteins, serving as a good host for pectate lyase expression and application. in addition, proteins expressed by p. pastoris were sometimes n-glycosylated and had improved thermo-stability  <cit> , which made p. pastoris more suitable for industrial application  <cit> .

the genome of bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str.  <dig> has been sequenced previously  <cit> , and the pectate lyase gene pel <dig> of this strain has been identified and expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig>  for analysis of protein structure  <cit> . five putative n-glycosylation sites on pel <dig> can be deduced from the sequence. however, no previous work was reported concerning the heterologous expression in p. pastoris and the ramie degumming experiments by pel <dig> 

with a long-term goal to produce low-cost pectate lyase in industry application, structure based enzyme engineering is a major technical pathway to obtain optimized enzymes for industrial degumming. in the mean time, finding an ideal host for heterologous expression of the optimized enzyme is also essential for the large scale application. therefore, we tested the expression of the alkaline pectate lyase gene pel <dig> in p. pastoris and investigated the effectiveness of the recombinant enzyme pel <dig> on degumming in this research. the data showed that the gene pel <dig> can be expressed in p. pastoris and recombinant pel <dig> can be used to remove pectin from ramie efficiently in degumming process. in order to improve the expression level, the pel <dig> was further optimized according to the codon bias of p. pastoris to obtain  <dig>  fold increase in extracellular activity. this is the first report that pectate lyase pel <dig> can be used to remove pectin from ramie efficiently and that codon optimization was successfully used to increase the expression of pectate lyase in p. pastoris.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of pectate lyase pel168
the nucleotide sequence of pectate lyase gene pel <dig> from b. subtilis  <dig> was obtained from genbank . the estimated molecular mass of pel <dig> was  <dig> kda with a 21-residue signal peptide  <cit> . five putative n-glycosylation sites  were found: three of them were near to the n terminus , and the other two were near the c terminus .

expression and deglycosylation of recombinant pel <dig> expressed in p. pastoris
the gene pel <dig> of b. subtilis  <dig> was cloned into the e. coli expression vector pet28a and p. pastoris expression vector phbm905a, respectively. to distinguish pel <dig> expressed in e. coli and p. pastoris, the two enzymes were named pel168e and pel168p, respectively. the enzyme was purified and the purity was quantified by sds-page. purified pel168e showed one band with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda , as predicted. however, pel168p had two bands with molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively , both larger than predicted. after a deglycosylation step by endoglycosidase h, only one band showed on sds-page, with the same size as the one expressed in e. coli, which suggested that the recombinant pel168p had different degrees of glycosylation. comparison of the molecular masses of the enzymes before and after deglycosylation showed that the percentages of glycosylation of the two fragments were 5% and 12%, respectively.

effect of cultivation temperature on pel168p expression in p. pastoris
transformant p. pastoris gs115-pel <dig> was cultured in bmmy liquid medium. the enzyme activity in culture supernatants was assayed daily for  <dig> days. as shown in figure 2a, the time of optimal secretion of pel168p was  <dig> days at two incubation temperatures. maximum values of pectate lyase activity in culture supernatants were  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/ml at 25°c and 30°c , respectively. the culture kept at 25°c provided about  <dig> -fold more activity than that kept at 30°c.

characterization of the pectate lyase pel168
the activities of the recombinant pel168s were measured at different temperatures . the optimum reaction temperature of the two pel168s  was both 50°c, and the two enzymes both showed more than 50% activity from  <dig> to 55°c. at 50°c, the optimum ph for the two pel168s was  <dig> , and both enzymes had more than 60% activity from ph  <dig> to  <dig> . therefore, pel <dig> appears to be an alkaline-stable enzyme. the thermo-stability of these two pectate lyases was also investigated. the enzymes were pre-incubated without the substrate at  <dig>   <dig> and 60°c, respectively. for designated time periods, the two kinds of enzymes retained more than 85% of their initial activity at 40°c for  <dig> min. however, at 60°c, pel168e completely lost its activity after  <dig> min pre-incubation, whereas pel168p kept 26% of its initial activity with the same treatment .

pel168p had better thermo-stability and was more suitable for industrial application than pel168e. thus, we characterized pel168p in detail. under the optimum conditions as described above, the enzyme had a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg  with a km of  <dig>  mg/ml and a vmax of  <dig>  μmol/min. table  <dig> showed the effects of various metal ions and chemicals on the enzyme activity of pel168p. k+, li+, ni2+ and sr2+ showed little or no inhibition effect on the enzyme activity. mn2+, hg2+ and cu2+ inhibited the most enzyme activity. zn2+, fe3+, mg2+ and co2+ reduced the enzyme activity by 35–55%. however, the enzyme activity was enhanced by 38% with ca2+ addition. for the chemicals assayed, the purified enzyme completely lost its activity with sds or edta. tween- <dig>  methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and glycerol showed slight or no inhibition effect on the enzyme activity, and dmso showed 25% activation.

codon optimization of pel168
in order to further increase the expression levels of pel <dig> in p. pastoris, the sequence of pel <dig> was optimized according to the codon bias of p. pastoris. two hundred and ninety four nucleotides were substituted in the optimized sequence of pel168s. the g+c content of the original gene is  <dig> %, as compared to  <dig> % after codon optimization. the gene sequences before and after codon optimization were provided as additional file  <dig>  the expression analysis showed that transformants contained a single copy chromosomal integration of optimized pel <dig> gene. and the transformant expressed  <dig>  fold enzyme activity compared to the original pel168-containing strain under the same conditions, with enzyme activities in the supernatant of  <dig>  u/ml and  <dig>  u/ml , respectively.

effects of degumming by pel <dig> expressed in p. pastoris
the degumming effects are shown in figure  <dig>  the ramie textile treated by pel168p became softer, smoother and whiter, compared with that treated only with  <dig>  m gly–naoh buffer. dry weight measurement showed that enzyme-treated textile lost 15% weight. residual content of gum was measured as 2% by alkaline treatment at high temperature. the textiles were also observed using a scanning electron microscope, and the enzyme-treated sample showed a smoother surface, suggesting that the gum-like material was mainly removed by pectate lyase pel168p .

discussion
gum-like materials from natural ramie fibers are soluble at high temperature and alkaline conditions, so chemical degumming is usually performed with alkaline treatment at high temperature, which causes serious environmental pollution. enzymatic degumming serves as a good alternative to reduce pollution and cause less fiber damage. therefore, developing a cost-efficient bio-degumming process of ramie by alkaline pectate lyase or bio-chemical degumming methods represents a major future trend of degumming industry. the low-cost of alkaline pectate lyase will be a key issue for accelerating bio-degumming application in the ramie treatment process. so it is important to get the cost-efficient and thermo-stable petate lyase with an improved expression level in an ideal host. p. pastoris is a preferred host for heterologous protein production with fast growing and facilitated gene manipulation. moreover, it can also secrete heterologous protein efficiently. thus, there is no need to break the cell and the enzyme secreted is easy to purify, which makes p. pastoris a more suitable host for industrial application  <cit> . specifically, p. pastoris is an attractive host for pectate lyase expression because it does not produce endogenous cellulases that weaken the fiber of ramie. in this study, the pectate lyase gene pel <dig> of bacillus subtilis  <dig> was first successfully expressed in p. pastoris and the expression level was further increased by gene codon optimization.

the results in our study also indicated that the pectate lyase heterologously expressed in p. pastoris has different extents of glycosylation. it was reported that enzyme glycosylation in p. pastoris leads to better thermo-stability  <cit> . although in the standard deglycosylation process, the pectate lyase must be denatured by boiling before being treated with endoglycosidase h, which makes it impossible to compare catalytic performance of the enzyme before and after deglycosylation. we described the influence of n-glycosylation on pel <dig> by comparing the properties of the n-glycosylated with the non-glycosylated pel168e from e. coli. the result showed that n-glycosylation did improve pel <dig> thermo-stability. thus, pel168p was more stable in application and more suitable for degumming.

there are also some reports about the expression and characterization of alkaline pectate lyase. yuan et al. cloned alkaline pectate lyase gene from xanthomonas campestris <cit>  and streptomyces sp. s <dig>  <cit> , and expressed in e. coli, respectively. the optimum temperatures of the recombinant pectate lyases from x. campestris and streptomyces sp. s <dig> are 30°c and 60°c, while the optimum ph are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a later effort by solbak et al. leads to a candidate enzyme with an improved optimum temperature from 50°c to 70°c for the purpose of bioscouring  <cit> . li et al. cloned an alkaline pectate gene from bacillus sp. n16- <dig> and expressed it in e. coli. the optimum temperature and ph of the recombinant enzyme were 50°c and  <dig>   <cit> . our initial trial to express alkaline pectate gene n16- <dig> in p. pastoris fails to get a high yield. we then turn our focus to the expression another alkaline pectate lyase which was originally isolated from b. subtilis  <dig> in p. pastoris. the recombinant pel168p obtained in our current study displayed high efficiency at ph  <dig>  and 50°c, with a specific activity  for removing the ramie pectin effectively in degumming process. this will provide a good starting point for further optimization of its thermo-stability and specific activity through protein engineering and strain engineering methods.

the codon optimization technique has been widely used to increase the expression levels of foreign proteins in p. pastoris <cit> , but not always successfully, and there is no related report about pectate lyases yet. so we tried the strategy described above in this study so as to increase the expression level. expression and fermentation analysis showed optimized pel168s expressed  <dig>  fold enzyme activity compared to the original pel <dig>  this is the first report of codon optimization successfully increasing the expression of pectate lyase in p. pastoris.

the cultivation temperature is also an important factor for optimal production of heterologous proteins. previous investigations have shown that lower cultivation temperature might improve the production of heterologous protein in p. pastoris, such as laccase  <cit>  and xylanase  <cit> . this was also observed in our study. culture at 25°c provided about  <dig> -fold more activity than at 30°c. it has previously been shown that a lower cultivation temperature improves the production of heterologous protein in e. coli <cit> , which can be attributed to aggregation problems at higher temperatures.

in the degumming experiment, our result also showed that pel168p can remove gum efficiently from ramie with a reduced process time. in the previous reports, the bio-degumming were usually performed by two ways. first, degumming was performed by isolated strains with high pectate lyase activity  <cit> . the degumming strains were inoculated on ramie fiber and incubated for a certain time, some degumming enzymes were produced with the growth of degumming strain so that the gum in the ramie fiber can be removed. for example, after  <dig> h of incubation with the isolated pectinolytic strain b. pumilus dks <dig>  the weight loss of the ramie fiber was found to be 25% under small scale  <cit> . this method requires longer time to perform degumming process because of the growth of degumming strains. second, degumming was performed by enzymes from fermentation supernatant of isolated strains  <cit> , which mainly includes pectate lyase and other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. culture supernatant of amycolata sp. containing cellualse, xylanase and pectate lyase, reduced the gum content of ramie fibers by 30% within  <dig> h  <cit> . brühlmann et al.  <cit>  studied pectinolytic enzymes from actinomycetes for the degumming of ramie bast fibers. the gum content of the fibers decreased from 24% to 18% after  <dig> h treatment with crude enzyme preparations from a selection of actinomycetes at room temperature. this method also requires  <dig> h treatment since the activity of degumming enzyme isolated from wild strain is relatively low. from our data of sem, the surface of the pel168p-treated ramie looks smoother, which suggests that unique pectate lyase could also provide better degumming effects . as compared to previous bio-degumming methods, the enzymatic degumming by pel168p is more efficient and stable, with a minimal detrimental effect for fiber. thus, pel168p is a potential candidate to be used in bio-degumming process.

the protein structure information of pectate lyase pel <dig> of bacillus subtilis  <dig> is available now  <cit> , which makes the enzyme rational design possible. thus, pel168p is a potential candidate for further improving the specific activity and reducing the cost so that it can be used in bio-degumming industry.

CONCLUSIONS
in general, the alkaline pectate lyase gene pel <dig> can be expressed in p. pastoris as a functional enzyme, and pel <dig> can efficiently remove gum from ramie during the degumming process. in order to improve the expression level, the pel <dig> was further optimized according to the codon bias of p. pastoris and resulted in  <dig>  fold increase in extracellular activity. this is the first report that glycosylation of pectate lyase can improve thermo-stability and the expression of pectate lyase in p. pastoris is increased by codon optimization.
