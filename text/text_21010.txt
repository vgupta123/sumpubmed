BACKGROUND
avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus , named as a gallid herpesvirus  <dig>  is a member of the iltovirus genus, alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, and herpesviridae family. iltv has a linearized dsdna genome of approximately  <dig> kb in size which contains unique long  and unique short  sequences flanked by inverted repeat  and terminal repeat  sequences  <cit> . the genome encodes  <dig> predicted viral protein open reading frames . iltv infection causes respiratory disease symptoms in chickens, pheasants, partridges, and peafowl  <cit> . clinical signs include extension of the neck, gasping, gurgling, rattling, and coughing of clotted blood  <cit> . iltv usually causes a reduction in egg production and variable mortality ranging from  <dig> to 70%, and can cause severe economic losses in the poultry industry  <cit> .

two types of commercial live attenuated vaccines, chicken embryo origin  and tissue culture origin , have been widely used to immunize chicken flocks against iltv  <cit> . however, it was found that live vaccines infect the nervous system similarly to virulent iltv infections, and could possibly induce vaccinal laryngotracheitis  by transmission to unvaccinated birds  <cit> . moreover, global iltv outbreaks are mostly associated with ceo vaccines  <cit>  and the genomic- and antigenic characteristics between virulent and vaccine iltv are very similar  <cit> .

microarray analysis has become popular, along with the recent development of a rna-seq  technique using next-generation sequencing, to analyze comprehensive gene expression in different biological conditions. microarrays have been performed intensively to investigate host gene transcriptional responses to infection by various viruses such as hepatitis c virus   <cit> , rice dwarf virus   <cit> , influenza virus  <cit> , herpesvirus saimiri   <cit> , human immunodeficiency virus   <cit> , japanese encephalitis virus   <cit> , chicken anemia virus   <cit> , human cytomegalovirus   <cit> , epstein-barr virus   <cit> , infectious laryngotracheitis virus   <cit> , varicella-zoster virus   <cit> , alphaherpesvirus  <cit> , marek's disease virus   <cit> , herpes simplex virus type  <dig>   <cit> , even in vaccine strains including recombinant flavivirus  <cit> , west nile/dengue  <dig> virus  <cit> , and dengue virus  <cit> .

previously, we studied the differential gene expression of host responses against virulent iltv infection in cultured primary chicken embryo lung cells using microarray analysis  <cit> . to compare and contrast host responses to infection of vaccine iltv to those of virulent iltv infection, primary chicken embryo lung cells were infected with live attenuated ceo vaccines and host gene expression during a four day period post infection was determined using  <dig> k chicken oligo microarrays in the present study.

RESULTS
profiling of differentially expressed host genes in vaccine iltv infection
primary chicken embryo lung cells at passage  <dig> were infected with  <dig> vaccination doses of a live fowl laryngotracheitis vaccine, which is widely used in the poultry industry. the infected cells were subjected to analysis for cytopathic effects and virus infection validation at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post infection . although weak cytopathic effects  were observed at certain locations of plates at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, infected cells began to recover by  <dig> dpi, and no cytopathic effects were observed at  <dig> dpi . to verify the infection of vaccine iltv, the expression of iltv viral rna was determined and genes of ul <dig> encoding a small capsid protein and us <dig> encoding an envelop glycoprotein j  were shown to progressively increase their expression post infection though us <dig> expression began to be detected from  <dig> dpi .

in the  <dig> k microarray assay, two approaches to avoid possible hidden dye effects were used: the use of rna spike-in controls synthesized from the adenovirus e1a transcriptomes containing different concentrations of dye in each set  <cit>  and the dye-swap in two of four total replicates. no significant dye effects were detected in all microarray slides . data analysis using one-way anova with the jmp genomics  <dig>  and a  <dig> fold or greater cut off value revealed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> different dpi time points following vaccine iltv infection . when these  <dig> differentially expressed genes were subjected to the bioinformatics study using ingenuity pathways analysis  to generate the gene networks and functional annotations,  <dig> genes were recognized as mapped ids  by the ipa program  and subjected to further bioinformatics analysis.

quantitative reverse transcription-pcr 
to validate the microarray results, expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes was subjected to qpcr using the same rna samples as those used in the microarray, and gene specific primer sets . of the  <dig> genes tested, the expression pattern for  <dig> genes completely matched the microarray data at four dpi time points. the expression pattern for the remaining  <dig> genes also qualitatively matched to microarray data, though they were not quantitatively matched . with the comparison of the spike-in controls, qpcr results indicated that the microarray data in this experiment were valid to determine host gene expression responses against vaccine iltv infection.

the gene expression levels of microarray were presented by log <dig> fold changes, whereas those of qpcr were indicated by -ΔΔct that are comparable to the log <dig> fold change values in microarray

biological functions of differentially expressed genes
using the ipa program, the subset of  <dig> mapped genes were categorized into  <dig> biologically functional groups, and the top  <dig> groups associated with a greatest number of genes, are shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> functional groups are mostly related to tissue development, cellular growth and proliferation, organismal development, cell death, cellular development, cellular movement, and inflammatory responses.

top  <dig> differentially expressed genes
of  <dig> genes with known functions with mapped ids, the top  <dig> most differentially expressed genes in iltv vaccine infection were selected based on differences of standard deviation  among all four dpi time points . the  <dig> most differentially expressed genes are involved in functions of reduced inflammatory responses, stimulation of cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, and promotion of cell-to-cell interactions. the general function and possible roles of these differentially expressed genes during iltv infection are outlined in table  <dig> 

• lymph-epithelial kazal-type-related inhibitor .
• suppresses cellular functions related to inflammation in human primary keratinocytes   <cit> .
• functions in angiogenesis in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> , and wound healing and development of exuberant granulation tissue in horses  <cit> .
• stimulates the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate the folding of proteins  <cit> .
• apoptosis and necrosis of cells were induced by the activation of the pt pore  <cit> .
• binds to baculovirus surface membrane to inhibit ligand-receptor interaction in viral infection of hela cells  <cit> .
• functions in conditions of pain and stress, the metabolism and homeostasis of feeding and energy in body, inflammatory diseases, smooth muscle contraction, and the control of blood flow and pressure  <cit> .
• induces early-phase inflammation through the degranulation in mast cells in which nmu-r <dig> is highly expressed  <cit> .
• acts as an inflammatory mediator via the acceleration of il- <dig> production in macrophages  <cit> .
• functions in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interaction on the cell surface for cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis  <cit> .
• up-regulated at carcinoma cells and functions the proliferation and progression of human lung and breast cancer cells  <cit> .
• acts as an inhibitor against human dental pulp stem cells  proliferation and an inducer of apoptosis of hdpscs through the stimulation of alkaline phosphatase  secretion and dentin sialophosphoprotein   <cit> .
• degrades insulin-like growth factor  binding protein  <dig>   <cit> .
• inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone  <cit> .
• binds and neutralizes activin, a paracrine hormone of tgf-β superfamily, which is related to the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis  <cit> .
• a member of fibrotic and wound healing response genes and cellular proliferation genes and plays a role in muscle growth and strength in nonhuman primates and liver proliferation. moreover, the small plaque mutant of vzv down-regulates fst  <cit> .
the c1q and tumor necrosis factor related protein  <dig>  is known to stimulate erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk  <cit> . c1qtnf <dig> expression was elevated from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi . in addition, cartonectin  helps reduce inflammation by suppressing il <dig> and tnf production and nf-κb signaling  <cit> . il <dig>  one of several cytomegalovirus secreted cytokines, enhances the survival of endothelial cells by blocking caspase  <dig> and caspase 7-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . ctrp <dig> could also accelerate embryonic growth and may contribute to a high feed efficiency phenotype in broilers  <cit> . thus, the continuous increase of ctrp <dig> expression from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi during iltv vaccine infection suggests the suppression of cellular factors related to inflammation and the promotion of cell recovery after the initial cytopathic effect that was exhibited in embryonic lung cells on 1dpi.

aquaporin  <dig>  expression, a water channel protein and part of the small integral membrane protein family, was elevated on  <dig> dpi, but decreased at 2- and 4- dpi . a deficiency aqp <dig> was shown to exacerbate lung injury by the infection of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . down-regulation of aqp <dig> increases proliferation and migration of human corneal epithelial  cell line  <cit> . adenovirus infection to mouse lung caused the down-regulation of aqp <dig> gene expression  <cit> . thus, the slight down-regulation of aqp <dig> gene expression in vaccine iltv infection in from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi may be associated with the reduced cytopathic effect and cell recovery.

cholecystokinin  was down-regulated in lung cells between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . cck is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system that is important in fat digestion  <cit> . cck induces apoptosis by stimulating death signaling pathways in rat pancreatic acinar cells, including caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial depolarization  <cit> . thus, the down-regulation of cck expression in vaccine iltv infected cells may suppress apoptosis, resulting in weak cytopathic effects.

gene networks
network analysis by ipa was used to draw connections between interacting focus molecules. of the  <dig> networks that were generated, the top  <dig> networks were identical among all four dpi, which may be due to the fact that the algorithms of the ipa program generate a network by considering fold change values and p-values of focus molecules in addition to their biological functions. the lists, top functions, and the most focused molecules of all four networks are shown in additional file  <dig>  and the drawings of interacting molecules in each network during the time course of all dpi are displayed in additional file  <dig> 

the most interactive network  at  <dig> dpi is presented in figure  <dig>  similar differential expression levels for focus molecules in network # <dig> are shown at all four dpi during iltv vaccine infection and the top functions related to genes in this network include free radical scavenging, lipid metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry. several secreting proteins such as figf , pdgfc , tnfsf <dig> , and crh  in network # <dig> are closely associated with the activation of the erk1/ <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . additional cellular factors, including mgat <dig> , hs6st <dig> , and cirbp , that activate erk 1/ <dig> by increased phosphorylation are also upregulated in vaccine iltv infection  <cit> . these results indicate that the mitogenic signaling pathway may be activated by increased phosphorylation of erk 1/ <dig> in vaccine iltv infection, resulting in weak cytopathic effects that facilitate the recovery of cellular proliferation capabilities of embryonic lung cells during vaccine iltv infection. in addition, several enzymatic antioxidants in lung cells that would reduce cellular oxidative stress included sod <dig> , gpx <dig> , and gsts  were also assigned to network # <dig>  this up-regulation of these enzymatic antioxidants would serve to protect cells from oxidant-mediated cell death. these results concur with a previous report of enhanced endogenous antioxidant protection during vaccine iltv infection and attenuation of cell death  <cit> . focus molecules found in network # <dig> can be summarized by the following functions: stimulation of various secreting proteins, inhibition of the cell death pathway, and attenuation of oxidative stress.

functional interpretation of other networks is described in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

comparison of host responses of virulent strain and vaccine iltv infection
previously, we reported  <dig> differentially expressed chicken genes mapped by the ipa program for virulent iltv infection and the analysis of the functions and molecular networks of these genes  <cit> . to find host cellular mechanisms common to both virulent strain and vaccine iltv infection, the  <dig> differentially expressed genes that responded to vaccine iltv infection in the present study were compared to the  <dig> differentially expressed genes found in the previous virulent iltv infection study. the results showed that  <dig> genes overlapped in both virulent strain and vaccine iltv infections. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> showed a similar differential expression pattern as found in the virulent iltv infection at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . interestingly,  <dig> of  <dig> genes were regulated in the distinct direction for expression patterns at  <dig> or  <dig> dpi between virulent and vaccine iltv in the present study . those genes included bone morphogenetic protein  <dig> , chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig> , coagulation factor × , and neuropeptide y .

bone morphogenetic proteins , as members of the transforming growth factor beta  superfamily, are involved in various cellular functions including cell type specification, differentiation, pluripotency, apoptosis, proliferation, and tissue morphogenesis  <cit> . deregulation of bmp signaling is also implicated in disease states including cancer  <cit> . though the functional role of bmp in iltv infection is unknown, bmps including bmp <dig> were found to mediate herpesviral reactivation found in the ebv positive cell line  <cit> . the expression and secretion of bmp <dig> was regulated by hiv proteins in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . expression of bmp <dig> in both virulent and vaccine iltv infections increased at 1dpi and the increased expression level in vaccine iltv infection was maintained until 3dpi, while the expression in virulent iltv was not changed at 3dpi . the continuous increase of bmp <dig> expression during iltv vaccine infection may play a homeostatic role in maintaining cellular morphology against virus infection.

neuropeptide y  involves multiple cellular mechanisms related to both virus entry into the central nervous system  and virus-induced neurological diseases. npy protects the nervous system from murine retrovirus-induced neurological disease  <cit> . the up-regulation of npy was observed in both infection and reactivation of vzv from a latent infection in human sensory trigeminal and dorsal ganglia, which are both sensory neurons  <cit> . it suggests that the up-regulation of npy in virulent iltv infection at  <dig> dpi may facilitate the latent infection in the nervous system. in contrast, the continuous down-regulation of npy in vaccine iltv infection may delay the latent infection to protect the host from diseases.

the coagulation factor, f <dig>  is highly expressed during the early phase of sars  corona virus infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells   <cit> . expression of f <dig> in vaccine iltv infections of lung cells increased at 1- and 3dpi, but the expression in virulent iltv was not changed significantly at either 1- or 3dpi . a functional role of increased expression and secretion of f <dig> in vaccine herpesvirus infected lung cells has not been studied to date. the c8orf <dig> is an orf region on chicken chromosome  <dig>  but its function is unknown.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we examined genome-wide host cellular transcriptomic changes by vaccine iltv infection. unlike our previous research on virulent iltv infection, the vaccine iltv infection showed weak cytopathic effects, cellular morphology recovery after initial cytopathic effects were observed and very little cell death. possible molecular interpretations confirmed the suppression of cell death and weak cytopathic effect production during vaccine iltv infection. four host cellular genes were significantly modulated by vaccine iltv infection, and could represent important secreting regulators to protect cells from cytotoxic damages. although host gene expression by vaccine iltv infection was determined in a cell culture system and not by an in vivo vaccination study, the results in this study provide important insights into differential host cellular defense mechanisms by regulating host gene expression response of vaccine iltv infection to compare those of virulent iltv infection.
