BACKGROUND
milk production traits are the most economically important traits in dairy cattle. identification of genetic variants affecting milk production traits is crucial for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variation and hence enhancing the breeding efficiency. although a large number of qtl for milk production traits have been reported  <cit> , merely a few strong candidate genes   responsible for the observed effect have been identified.

genomic selection has been widely implemented in dairy cattle since  <dig> and is bringing great changes in dairy cattle breeding system . however, gaining better knowledge of the genetic architecture of traits of interest is still important, since this could indeed lead to new insights in the molecular physiology of the interesting phenotypes, and is expected to bring about new opportunities for more effective breeding strategy.

with high throughput snp genotyping technologies, genome-wide association study  has been widely accepted as a primary approach for finding genes relevant to complex traits. several successful gwas based on the illumina bovinesnp <dig> beadchip identified a number of important candidate genes associated with milk production traits . although these findings provide new insights into genetic basis of milk production traits, the specific genes and causal variants underlying these traits have not yet been clearly defined because most of the detected snps are not the causal variants but markers being potentially in linkage disequilibrium  with the causal variants. moreover, some of the associated genes or variants do not have known or obvious functions related to milk production traits and some significant snps implicate regions with multiple genes or no genes, limiting biological extrapolation.

recent advances in next generation sequencing  technologies make it possible to sequence genomic regions exhaustively. targeted sequencing of specific regions using ngs technologies can efficiently capture all variants in these regions and their potential effects can be assessed by a subsequent association study, which provides an effective approach to find the causal variant affecting the concerned traits .

in our previous gwas study in chinese holstein cattle, we identified  <dig> snps associated significantly with milk production traits  <cit> . in this study, we employed the ngs technology to assess the candidate target regions implicated by these snps. we then carried out association analysis for the variants revealed by ngs. we further employed the expression analysis for  <dig> of the significant genes, which could be considered as novel promising candidate functional genes in dairy cattle. our results provide evidence towards biological function validation of genes for milk production traits in dairy cattle.

RESULTS
discovery of variants using targeted sequencing
the targeted resequencing of dna of  <dig> bulls  yielded large amounts of high-quality sequence data . in total,  <dig>  million 100-bp paired-ends reads  were obtained from the  <dig> pools. the sequence data achieved an average coverage of  <dig> × per pool, corresponding to an average coverage of 22× per individual. we captured  <dig> % of our target regions with > 20 × coverage and  <dig> % of target region with >50× coverage, and around 15% of target regions were poorly covered.

these sequences were mapped to the reference bovine umd <dig>  genome assembly to detect snps. a total of  <dig>  snps   were identified, of which  <dig> % are novel after comparing with the up to date cattle dbsnp database  <cit>  . the proportion of snps which are included in the dbsnp database was consistent across the ten pools, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

to validate the ngs results, sanger sequencing of pcr amplicons were carried out. we randomly chose three genes for validation.  <dig> snps were discovered by sanger sequencing, which include all snps  discovered by ngs in the three genes . the missing snps in ngs were largely due to the fact that the probes designed for ngs failed to cover the entire target regions. therefore, the ngs results are reliable for further research. these snps were categorized by their genic location  and by their predicted effect, including synonymous substitution, non-synonymous substitution and splice site alteration. notably, among all of the detected snps,  <dig> are located within exonic regions, of which  <dig> are non-synonymous mutation.

association study
from the  <dig>  snps detected by ngs, we selected  <dig> snps  for association study, including  <dig> in cds,  <dig> in utr,  <dig> in promoter regions and  <dig> in introns. the  <dig> snps were genotyped using sequenom massarray iplex platform in a population of  <dig> cows, which are daughters of  <dig> sires. the association analysis showed that a total of  <dig> snps distributed in  <dig> genes were significantly associated with one or multiple milk production traits . these  <dig> significant snps were located on five chromosomes including bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> contain or are close to snps with genome-wide significance for milk production traits in our previous gwas results  <cit> , and five  have effects on all the five traits.

to enlarge the reference population for association analysis, we imputed the genotypes of the  <dig> snps in another population of  <dig> cows, which were half sibs of the  <dig> cows, based on the illumina 54 k snp array genotype data on both populations. association study was performed again in the combined population consisting of  <dig> cows. a total of  <dig> significant snps distributed in  <dig> genes were identified , which include almost all the significant snps  from the first association analysis. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> contain or are close to snps with genome-wide significance for milk production traits in our previous gwas results  <cit> .table  <dig>

expression analysis of the candidate genes
we chose  <dig> out of the  <dig> significant genes to analyze their mrna expression in eight different tissues of lactating cows. fifteen of them showed higher mrna expression level in mammary gland than in the other seven tissues, especially rpl <dig>  eef1d, vps <dig>  eif2c <dig>  trappc <dig>  fam83h, heatr7a and gpihbp <dig> , and all of them had the lowest expression level in muscle . notably, the two genes dgat <dig> and ghr, which have been functionally confirmed to have large effects on milk production traits from previous studies , had higher mrna expression in liver besides in mammary gland . furthermore, eef1d and rpl <dig> showed the highest mrna expression levels in mammary gland among all the  <dig> genes  and gpihbp <dig> showed the largest difference in mrna expression between in mammary gland and in the other seven tissues.figure  <dig>

discussion
recent advances in next-generation sequencing  technology provide a cost-effective approach for large-scale resequencing of target genomic regions to identify causal variants. we describe here a pooled ngs study for resequencing of target regions containing  <dig> genes which were found to be potentially associated with milk production traits in our previous study  <cit> . we then carried out association analysis for  <dig> novel snps revealed by ngs in these regions. a total of  <dig> snps located on five chromosomes  and distributed in  <dig> genes were found to be significantly associated with one or multiple milk production traits.

in this study, estimated breeding values  of the studied traits were used as trait scores for the association analysis. some recent study  <cit>  showed that ebvs estimated using familial data should not be used as trait score for association analysis because this may lead to high false-positive rate. the authors recommended that when each genotyped individual has its own associated trait score, the “measured genotype” approach, in which the phenotypic value is used as a trait score and the additive polygenic effects are included in the model to account for the familial relatedness of individuals in the pedigree using the additive genetic relationships among individuals. however, for milk production traits in dairy cattle, it is hard to use the phenotypic value as a trait score because there are repeated measurements on each individual. another problem of using phenotypic value is that the systematic environmental effects on measured phenotypes may not be efficiently corrected because the sample size for association study is usually relative small in comparison with that for ebv prediction. these may be the reasons why in all gwas studies in dairy cattle either ebvs or de-regressed ebvs were used as trait score. in our previous gwas in chinese holstein  <cit> , we also compared using ebvs and de-regressed ebvs as phenotypes for our gwas and it turned out that the findings of them were basically overlap. therefore, in this study we chose to use ebvs as trait scores for association analysis, and we included the residual polygenic effects in the model to account for the familial relatedness of individuals.

the majority of the significant snps  are located on bta <dig>  these snps are distributed in  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were related to more than one trait, including  <dig>  related to all the five traits. bta <dig> has been reported repeatedly to harbor a large number of genetic variants associated with milk production traits in dairy cattle . in addition to numerous qtl  <cit> , a few candidate genes were also reported. in addition to the dgat <dig> gene, which was confirmed in almost all association studies to have strong association with multiple milk production traits  <cit> , a number of other genes were also reported, including mapk15

, cyp11b1
 <cit> , vps28
 <cit> , gpihbp1
 <cit> 
, kcnk9
 <cit> , trappc9
 <cit>  and cyhr1
 <cit> . all these genes were confirmed in the present study. since such a large number of significant snps are located on bat <dig>  it is very likely that some of the effects are due to linkage disequilibrium  with the real causative variants. we analyzed the ld levels between all the significant snps. the results show that some of them are in ld with r <dig> greater than  <dig>  . in particular, several of them are in strong ld with the snp within dgat <dig> , which is the most significant snp, and their significance are strongly correlated their ld levels with c <dig> . we then conducted a further association analysis for the snps on bta <dig> with c <dig> fixed in the model. it turned out that most of the snps became non-significant  or less significant . these results indicate that the effects of these snps revealed by the original association analysis  are indeed fully or partly due to their ld with c <dig> 

eleven out of the  <dig> significant snps are located on bta <dig> in  <dig> genes. all of them were associated with protein percentage and seven were also related to fat percentage, of which three were also related to milk yield. many researches indicated the importance of bta <dig> with respect to milk production traits in dairy cattle  <cit> . in particular, the ghr gene on bta <dig> was proved to be an important candidate gene for milk production traits by several studies  <cit> . furthermore, for protein percentage, many qtl were identified on bta <dig>  <cit> , and enrichment of significant snps on bta <dig> was also reported  <cit> . our results were consistent with these findings.

on bta <dig>  bta <dig> and bta <dig>  we identified two snps associated with milk protein percentage. the two snps on bta <dig> are within pde9a and dip2a, respectively. both snps on bta <dig> are within slc30a <dig>  the two snps on bta <dig> are within egfl <dig> and stxbp <dig>  respectively. none of these genes have been reported to be associated with protein percentage before, although some qtl  <cit>  as well as significant snps  <cit>  were reported on these chromosomes.

to further explore the potential functions of the genes revealed in this study, we analyzed the mrna expression of  <dig> significant genes in eight tissues of lactating dairy cows. it turned out that  <dig> genes had the highest mrna expression level in mammary gland compared to other tissues, indicating that these genes might play important roles during lactation period in dairy cattle. in particular, the expression levels of rpl <dig> and eef1d in mammary gland were the highest among the  <dig> genes , both of which were very strongly associated with fat percentage  in the association analysis. maningat et al.  <cit>  investigated gene expression in human mammary epithelium during lactation and found that many ribosomal protein family members, including rpl <dig>  showed the highest expression level in milk fat globule. pisanu et al.  <cit>  found that eef1d was specifically expressed in milk fat globule in sheep. these findings further support the association of these two genes with fat percentage. furthermore, the gpihbp <dig> gene, which was also very strongly associated with fat percentage , showed the largest difference in mrna expression level between mammary gland and the other seven tissues. the gpihbp <dig> protein is the glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored protein of the lymphocyte antigen  <dig>  family and is essential in the lipolytic processing of triglycerides within chylomicrons . this suggests that gpihbp <dig> may be involved in the process of milk fat production.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we detected a number of novel variants from significant regions associated with milk production traits in our previous gwas by ngs technology. the association analysis of  <dig> important variants revealed  <dig> significant snps distributed in  <dig> genes associated with milk production traits. the expression analysis for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes identified  <dig> genes that were specifically highly in mammary gland and may contribute to milk production traits. further study and integration of these findings will surely promote a better understanding of the global genetic architecture of milk production traits in dairy cattle.
