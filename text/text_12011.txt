BACKGROUND
water plays an important role in the function of biological molecules  <cit> . in the case of rna, water is regarded as "an integral part of nucleic acid structure" because it defines structure and folding and participates in intra-molecular interactions  <cit> . for example, the free energy of rna hairpins is considerably influenced by the presence of acceptor groups that do not form hydrogen bonds  <cit> . moreover, rna interactions with other molecules can be mediated by water molecules that link the two partners and water molecules bound to rna can be replaced by polar groups of other molecules  <cit> . furthermore, water molecules having large dipole moments modulate electrostatic interactions  <cit> . for these reasons, the understanding of rna hydration is of crucial importance in drug design and modeling interactions  <cit> . additionally, molecular dynamics simulations require the definition of the initial positions of the solvent atoms and the last stages of crystallographic refinements involve rna hydration sites  <cit> .

the most frequently used experimental methods to study rna hydration are x-ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy. nmr spectroscopy gives "dynamic viewpoints" of the micro-heterogeneity of the local hydration structure and provides information about the hydration kinetics  <cit> . crystallographic results are on the contrary considered, in general, as "static views", though some information about solvent dynamics can be obtained from the atomic displacement parameters, known also as b-factors  <cit> . additionally, the positions of the hydrogen atoms are usually not determined by crystallography and, as a consequence, the detailed description of the hydrogen bond stereochemistry is impossible. nevertheless, x-ray crystallography remains the most commonly used method to determine rna structures and hydration and, therefore, statistical surveys must be based on crystallographic results, the number of which is quickly increasing.

the earliest statistical analyses were focused on dna molecules  <cit> . hydration sites were revealed with three-dimensional solvent density maps, built on the basis of  <dig> high-resolution x-ray dna structures, and "hydration building blocks" were made for every particular base type  <cit> . auffinger and westhof extended this approach to rna molecules  <cit>  and a web server  was developed  <cit> . it provides the solvation of dna, rna, and hybrid base pairs by using the generation of 3d solvent density maps. however, most of the rna structures are rather irregular and contain many unpaired nucleotides  <cit> , which, as a consequence, are not analyzed by the sws web-server.

in the present study, the high-resolution x-ray structures of unpaired rna bases were analyzed. by using monte carlo simulations and cluster analysis methods, we found hydration sites around unpaired rna bases, which appear to be tightly bound to the nucleotides. many of these solvation sites, which participate in complex hydrogen bond networks, match the hydration sites found in the major and minor grooves of rna and dna double helices.

RESULTS
is the extent of hydration around the bases different?
the method described in reference  <cit> , which is based on the statistical zi test  <cit> , was used to compare the extent of hydration around the two pyrimidine and the two purine bases. for example, given a dataset with ox, the number of oxygen atoms around cytosine bases; oy, the number of oxygen atoms around uracil bases; fx, the number of cytosine bases; and fy, the number of uracil bases, it is possible to compute the expected number of water molecules  around cytosines

  ex=fxfx+fy. 

the fraction of uracil bases in the dataset is

  py=fyfx+fy, 

and the value of z for cytosines can be computed as

  z=pyex, 

where c is equal to  <dig>  if ex >ox or to  <dig>  if ex <ox. for example, for cytosine versus uracil, the following values can be seen in table 1: ox. =  <dig>  oy =  <dig>  fx =  <dig>  and fy = 138; as a consequence, ex =  <dig> , py =  <dig> , and c =  <dig> ; and therefore z =  <dig> . the z values are then equal to  <dig>  for cytosine,  <dig>  for uracil,  <dig>  for adenine and to  <dig>  for guanine. given that the z threshold values are  <dig> , at the 10% probability level, and  <dig> , at the 5% level of probability, it can be concluded the hydration extent of pyrimidine and purine bases is the statistically the same. the smaller unpaired cytosines and uracils, on the one hand, and the larger unpaired adenines and guanines, on the other, have the same penchant to be surrounded by water molecules.

clustering tendency
the clustering tendency of the water molecules around the unpaired rna bases was estimated by means of the well-known hopkins statistics  <cit> , which compares two alternative hypotheses: uniform distribution of water molecules, on the one hand, and natural organization into discrete clusters, on the other.

let x = {xi, i = l to n} to be a collection of n observed water molecules and let y = {yi, i = l to m} to be an ensemble of m random points within the space occupied by the water molecules. let be m < <n. two types of distances are defined: uj is the minimal distance between yj and its nearest element of x; and wj is the minimal distance from the randomly selected jth element of x to its nearest neighbor element of x. the hopkins statistic is defined as

  h=∑j=1muj∑j=1muj+ ∑j=1mwj 

in present study, n is equal to the number of water molecules around the rna bases ; m is equal to  <dig>  a number much smaller than the numbers of water molecules located around each type of base. the values of the h index range from  <dig> , for uracil, to  <dig> , for cytosine and guanine, and to  <dig> , for adenine. they are considerably higher than the value of  <dig> , which is expected for a totally uniform distribution. they are also higher than the value of  <dig> , which is usually taken as a threshold, over which the data present a natural tendency to be organized into discrete clusters  <cit> . consequently, it can be concluded that the water molecules that surround unpaired rna bases tend to be located in discrete hydration sites.

hydration clusters
several clusters of water molecules were detected around unpaired rna bases, only three around cytosine and up to seven around guanine . the coordinates of the water clusters around the unpaired rna bases are represented in the additional files: guanine , adenine , cytosine , uracil . about 30% of the water molecules can be grouped into separate clusters around purine bases  and about 20% around pyrimidine bases . this implies that many solvent molecules are not found into well-defined hydration sites but are, on the contrary, spread around the bases. this might depend on the fact that the crystal packing and the local environment can be extremely variable from one structure to the next. however, several solvation sites are observable.

each cluster is associated with a name ; the number of water molecules that it contains; the cluster compactness, defined at the maximal distance of a water molecule from the cluster center; the atom of the base that is the closest to it; the distance from this atom; the angle centered on this atom; the torsional angle that monitors deviation of the cluster from the base plane; and the other atoms that might interact with it.

* distances that are longer than  <dig>  Å are placed in parentheses.

the watson-crick edge contains the atoms involved in the strongest interactions that stabilize the base-pairing. the hydration centers around the unpaired bases do not replicate the positions of the complementary base atoms . only one hydration center , located in the area along of the watson-crick edge, was detected for the unpaired uracil bases . the watson-crick edge of the unpaired bases interacts more frequently with proteins, ligands, and ions than with water molecules .

the dimensions of the hydration clusters are relatively variables . some of them contain several tens of water molecules, like, for example, cluster w <dig> around adenine  and others are considerably smaller, like cluster w <dig> around guanine . the compactness of each cluster, measured as the maximal distance of a water molecule from the center of the cluster, ranges from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å .

conformational analysis
since the base hydration may depend on the nucleotide conformation  <cit> , the rna stereochemistry was examined. it is described by the sugar ring conformation, the mutual arrangement of the sugar and of the base rings, and by six backbone torsion angles  <cit> . four main sugar ring puckerings are possible, as it is summarized by the sugar pucker circle reported in the server  <cit> . two main arrangements, anti and syn, are possible for the base and the sugar rings. the backbone torsions tend to have values near 180°, 60°, and -60°, which are called trans, gauche+, and gauche-.

most of the possible conformations were observed in the structures of free and hydrated nucleotides examined in the present paper. those that were observed more frequently and that were associated with at least  <dig> water molecules are listed in table  <dig>  the atomic coordinates of the conformations of the unpaired base are represented in the additional files: guanine , adenine , cytosine , uracil . all of them have anti arrangement of the base and of the sugar rings, whereas the stereochemistry of the nucleotide backbone varies considerably. the sugar ring adopts the c3'-endo or the c2'-endo conformation in most of the cases and only one exo conformation is observed for adenine.

the conformation c3'-endo_anti_-g_t_g_g_t_-g is the most frequently observed, like for the rna base-pairs  <cit> .

different conformations exhibit dissimilar degrees of hydration. while the common c3'-endo_anti_-g_t_g_g_t_-g conformation has about  <dig> water molecules around the base, other, less common conformations present larger numbers of water molecules. for example, there are on average  <dig> water molecules around adenine in the c3'-endo_anti_t_t_t_g_t_-g or in the c3'-endo_anti_-g_t_t_g_t_-g conformation. however, there are also cases where the degree of hydration is considerable smaller. for example, there are only  <dig> water molecules, on average, around the guanine in conformation c3'-endo_anti_t_t_t_g_t_-g or c3'-endo_anti_-g_t_g_g_-g_-g.

the physicochemical reason of this variability is unclear, on the basis of the data presented here. this might depend on the paucity of the data or on the effects of the crystal packing.

hydrogen bond network
hydrogen bonds can be classified according to the interacting atoms or with numerical criteria based on energy or on geometry  <cit> . in present study, we use the geometric criteria described in  <cit> : the hydrogen bond is very strong if the distance between donor and acceptor atoms is in the range  <dig> - <dig>  Å, strong if it is in the range  <dig> - <dig>  Å, and weak if it is in the range  <dig> - <dig>  Å.

pertinent details about the hydrogen bonds around free rna bases are shown in table  <dig>  each cluster of water molecules, represented by its center of mass, is associated with the following variables: the nearest rna base atom, the distance from the nearest rna base atom, the bond angle centered on the nearest rna base atom, and the torsion that monitors the out-of-base-plane distortion of the hydrogen bond. the atoms that define the bond angles and torsions are specified in table  <dig>  the hydrogen bond networks are also depicted in the figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

guanine and adenine
in the present paragraph and in the next one, we describe in detail each hydration clusters observed around unpaired bases, its interactions with the rna molecules, and we compare it with similar hydration sites observed in other studies of nucleic acid hydration.

the cluster w <dig>  facing the n <dig> nitrogen atom of guanine and adenine , is compatible to the major groove hydration site that was well detected in rna and dna  <cit> . the n <dig> ..w <dig> interaction was considered to be a strong hydrogen bond, given its distance in the range  <dig> - <dig>  Å. w <dig> is located roughly in the base plane and may interact also with the backbone op <dig> and op <dig> oxygen atoms.

also the cluster w <dig>  facing the o <dig> oxygen atom of guanine  or the n <dig> nitrogen atom of adenine , is compatible to the major groove hydration site found in rna and dna double helices  <cit> . a previous statistical analysis of rna base-pairs hydration revealed that the cluster w <dig> is less compact than cluster w <dig> for guanine  <cit> . however, in the present analysis of unpaired guanine bases, cluster w <dig> seems to be slightly less compact than cluster w <dig> . furthermore, while cluster w <dig> lies roughly in the guanine plane and makes a strong hydrogen bond with cluster w <dig>  it is markedly out of the adenine plane and does not interact with cluster w <dig> of adenine. another difference between adenine and guanine is the distance of cluster w <dig> from the base. it is larger for adenine  than for guanine , though this might be explained by the different nature of the hoh...o = and of the h2o...hn- hydrogen bonds  <cit> .

the cluster w <dig> is hydrogen bonded to the n <dig> nitrogen atom and it lies on the base plane of both adenine and guanine . such a hydration site was found also in the minor groove of the rna and dna helices  <cit> . the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group in rna is a reason of the profound structural and dynamical differences between dna and rna molecules. in the detailed study of the high resolution crystal structure of the rna duplex [r.

the most important steric difference between adenine and guanine is the n <dig> nitrogen atom of guanine. this also differentiates the rna and dna hydration in the minor groove  <cit> . a statistical study of rna x-ray structures revealed significant displacements of the positions of the hydration site facing the n <dig> nitrogen atom of guanine in the watson-crick g-c and in the wobble g-u base pairs  <cit> . in an analogous study of the dna base pairs, a well-localized hydration site around the n <dig> nitrogen atom was not observed  <cit> .

in the present analysis of unpaired rna guanines, we observed two clusters close to the n <dig> nitrogen atom, w <dig> and w <dig>  the cluster w <dig> lies in the guanine plane and is closer to the atom n <dig> than the cluster w <dig>  which does not lie in the guanine plane. cluster w <dig> is very small  and compact  and makes a strong hydrogen bond with cluster w <dig>  for adenine, on the contrary, only one cluster of water molecules is observed in this region. it does not interact directly with adenine but it makes a strong hydrogen bond with cluster w <dig> 

intriguingly, a seventh cluster of water molecules is observed around guanine . it is one of the largest  and relatively compact. however, this cluster is isolated  from any nucleotide atoms and any water molecule of other clusters and it does not participate in the hydrogen bond network around unpaired guanine bases.

cytosine and uracil
around both cytosine and uracil there is a cluster of water molecules  that is hydrogen bonded to the hydrophilic group in position  <dig>  the nitrogen atom n <dig> of cytosine and the oxygen atom o <dig> of uracil. this interaction seems to be quite strong given the short inter-atomic distance and the fact that the water molecules tend to lie on the base plane . a similar, strong hydrogen bond was observed in the major groove of rna and dna double helices  <cit> .

a second cluster of water molecules  is also observed for both cytosine and uracil. it bridges the base and the phosphate, by means of a week hydrogen bond with the ch group of the base  <cit>  and a strong or weak hydrogen bond with the op <dig> oxygen atom . despite a position that it is markedly out of the plane of the base , it was observed also in statistical analyses of x-ray structures of rna base pairs  <cit> .

a third cluster  is observed only around cytosine. it is part of the base-phosphate n4- ow- ow -op <dig> bridge that contains two water molecules and that is well known and characteristic of nucleic acids  <cit> . the structural element w2-op2-w <dig> around the cytosine , with an angle of about  <dig> degrees, was found also in the high resolution  a-dna crystal structure of d  <cit> .

the weak c-h...o hydrogen bonds are important in the structure of biological molecules  <cit> . in the present study, such interactions were detected for the pyrimidines. one cluster of uracil  and two clusters of cytosine  make weak hydrogen bonds with the c <dig> carbon atom . in a statistical analysis of the crystallographic rna structures  <cit> , it was shown that the c <dig> carbon atom of the pyrimidines is involved in hydrogen bonds more often than other carbon atoms and that the interactions between water molecules and the c <dig> carbon atom are stronger in cytosine than in uracil  <cit> .

no other clusters of water molecules were observed around cytosine. on the contrary, two other clusters are present around uracil. one of them  bridges the o <dig> oxygen atom of the base and the o2' hydroxyl oxygen atom of the ribose, being severely distorted from the uracil plane. it was also observed in the minor groove of uracils  <cit> . the other  lies in the base plane and is strongly hydrogen bonded to the n <dig> nitrogen atom of uracil. interestingly, this is the only cluster of water molecules that occupies the place that is taken by another rna base atom  when a base pair  is formed.

other non-bonding interactions around unpaired rna bases
only for uracil, all the hydrophilic atoms of the base were found to be hydrogen-bonded to a cluster of water molecules. the n <dig> atom of both purines and the n <dig> and o <dig> atoms of cytosine were found to lack a well clustered hydration site .

therefore, we studied the crystal packing contacts in the x-ray structures to verify if these potential hydration sites might be occupied by symmetry related atoms. the "symexp" command of the pymol program  <cit>  was used to generate crystal symmetry-related atoms within  <dig> Å around the reference molecules of the pdb files. furthermore, we examined the interactions  with other rna nucleotides within the same asymmetric unit, which cannot be considered a proper pairing of two nucleotides, and also with proteins, ligands, and ions.

the numbers of the atom-atom interactions, involving the unpaired rna bases, are shown in table  <dig>  less than 10% of the unpaired rna bases participate in the interactions with another rna nucleotides within the same asymmetric unit. 12-15% of the unpaired adenine, guanine and cytosine bases are involved in crystal packing contacts. the fraction of uracils involved in crystal packing is slightly larger . the frequency of interactions with atoms of proteins, ligands and ions is rather variable: 40% of cytosines, 44% of adenines, 54% of uracils, and 73% of guanines are in contact with these type of molecules. most of these interactions were found in the large ribosome complexes.

number of the unpaired rna bases participating in the atom-atom interactions within  <dig> Å and number of atoms around these unpaired bases. for example,  <dig> from  <dig> unpaired adenine bases  have crystal packing contacts within  <dig> Å and the number of surrounding atoms that participate in these interactions is  <dig>  the empirical parameter d, used for cluster detection , is also reported for each type of interaction.

* - number of unpaired bases.

** - number of atoms surrounding the base

the same clustering procedure used to identify hydration sites was employed to analyze the spatial distribution of all the atoms that surround the unpaired rna bases. the values of the empirical parameter d are shown in table  <dig>  this was impossible for the rna atoms around unpaired pyrimidine bases, because of the paucity of data.

while the interactions with other rna molecules of the same asymmetric unit were limited to stacking contacts, clusters of crystal symmetry related atoms were found close to the n <dig> nitrogen atom of guanine and close to the atoms n <dig> and o <dig> of cytosine. these clusters are compatible with the presence of hydration sites. it is thus possible that absence of water molecules close to these three rna atoms is due, at least in part, to the fact that the space close to these three rna atoms is occupied, in the crystal structures, by symmetry related molecules. this hypothesis is also supported by the observation that several clusters of atoms of proteins, ligands, and ions are found around guanines and adenines, mimicking their solvatation. surprisingly, this was not observed for the smaller pyrimidines.

atomic displacement parameter
the atomic displacement parameter, or b-factor, is determined by molecular plasticity/rigidity and conformational disorder  <cit> . we have carried out a comparative analysis of b-factors of different rna and water atoms in order to estimate the degree of rigidity of the water molecules in the clusters around the bases of unpaired rna nucleotides. first, b-factors were normalized to zero mean and unit variance  <cit>  with the following equation:

  bn=b-babσ 

where b is b-factor of the rna or water atom, ba is the average b-factor and bσ is the standard deviation computed over all the atoms. such normalization is necessary for a number of reasons: the b-factors may be influenced by numerous computational details and their values and variability might not reflect genuine physical features; moreover, although most of the crystal structures examined in the present paper were determined in the 100- <dig> kelvin range of temperature, some were determined at a lower or higher temperature .

average normalized b-factors  with their standard deviations, computed for different types of atoms: base atoms belonging to paired nucleotides; base atoms belonging to unpaired nucleotides; oxygen atoms of water molecules that do not belong to clusters; oxygen atoms of water molecules that reside into the clusters described in table  <dig> 

the bn values of the unpaired nucleotides are more than the double than the bn value of the nucleotides that form base-pairs. unpaired nucleotides of pyrimidines, that contain only one heterocyclic ring, are less rigid than purines, which have two rings. on the contrary, there is less difference in the bn values of purines and pyrimidines that form base-pairs.

water molecules that could not be grouped into discrete clusters have relatively large bn values, are slightly smaller around cytosine. water molecules that cluster into the hydration sites described above have bn values that are quite variable. however, on average, they resemble the bn values of the other water molecules and of the unpaired base atoms. this indicates clearly that solvent dynamics are correlated with base mobility.

CONCLUSIONS
hydration sites around unpaired rna bases were found. many of them match the hydration sites found in the major and minor grooves of rna and dna double helices. on the contrary, they do not replicate the atom positions of complementary bases in the watson-crick pairs. the watson-crick edge of the unpaired bases interacts more frequently with proteins, ligands, and ions than with water molecules. the hydration site positions defined in the present study can be used to analyze rna structure and function, in drug design and modeling interactions, and in the last stages of crystallographic refinements.
