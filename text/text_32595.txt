BACKGROUND
the genus xiphophorus is comprised of  <dig> species of live-bearing platyfish and swordtails . xiphophorus species are found in a very broad geographical range, exceeding  <dig>  km, from northern mexico and south to honduras. this extensive range following the sierra madres uplift harbors many different environments at a wide range of altitudes   <cit> . schartl et al.  recently reported the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of a platyfish, xiphophorus maculatus jp  <dig> a, thus detailing the first genome architecture from a live-bearing poeciliid fish  <cit> . since publication of the platyfish genome assembly, genome resources for other poeciliid fishes, such as poecilia reticulata   <cit> , poecilia formosa  and poecilia latipinna  are publically available or will soon be released. in addition to the whole genome, transcriptomes of x. maculatus have been sequenced, de novo assembled from rnaseq data  <cit>  and annotated using homologous coding sequences from related species . the availability of the x. maculatus reference genome and transcriptome assemblies have greatly accelerated the identification of differences that are coincidental with speciation, the evolution of genetic incompatibility, and the genetics underlying pigment pattern expression, and sex determination in xiphophorus .fig.  <dig> fish used in this study. approximate geographical distributions of three xiphophorus species. the swordtail, x. hellerii is a male fish showing an extended caudal fin ray, while x. maculatus and x. couchianus are platyfish and do not exhibit this caudal fin extension. the stars are the locations where fishes were collected and the red stars are the location of sequenced fish originally derived



xiphophorus fishes have been used as an experimental vertebrate biomedical research model for nearly 90 years. xiphophorus interspecies hybrids have been a long-standing experimental model for both spontaneous and uv or carcinogen induced melanoma  <cit> . the first xiphophorus interspecies backcross leading to spontaneous development of melanoma among interspecies backcross hybrids was described in  <dig>  <cit> . since this time, many other interspecies crosses have been described that produce animals displaying genetic predisposition to various types of induced tumors , and these are still actively utilized experimental models for assessment of genetic interactions leading to tumor development  <cit> .

due to this scientific history, and an ever increasing use of xiphophorus in contemporary experimental biology, the xiphophorus genetic stock center  was first established in the 1930’s and has remained in continuous operation as one of the oldest live animal resource centers worldwide. twenty-four xiphophorus species and  <dig> pedigreed lines are maintained in the xgsc and fish lines that have been sequenced for this study are available for research upon request  <cit> .

the x. maculatus jp  <dig> a utilized for genome sequencing was a female derived from the 104th generation of sibling inbreeding within the xgsc. the x. maculatus jp  <dig> a genome assembly comprises  <dig>  scaffolds with an n <dig> of  <dig>  mb and the final assembled sequence length is 730 mb  <cit> . more recently, a extremely dense rad-tag map  scored from x. maculatus jp  <dig> a  x. hellerii backcross has been produced and this meiotic map aligned with the genome assembly  <cit> . consolidation of the genome assembly and rad-tag maps provides one of the most detailed and highly resolved gene maps for any vertebrate experimental model system. however, a single map remains problematic when one wishes to assess the contribution of each parental allele to complex traits that appear within interspecies backcross hybrids, such as the genes underlying induced melanoma.

availability of new xiphophorus genomic resources, coupled with the capability of producing fertile interspecies hybrids and ample polymorphic content among the varied xiphophorus species, can fully unleash the potential of xiphophorus as an experimental model for understanding the molecular basis of morphological and physiological differences, and the inheritance of complex traits. herein, we report sequencing and genome assembly of x. hellerii, also known as a “green swordtail”, and x. couchianus commonly called the “monterrey playfish”. these two species, in conjunction with x. maculatus, serve as parents in four distinct spontaneous and induced melanoma models, as well as a cross leading to increased incidence of induced retinoblastoma, neurofibrosarcoma, and schwannoma  <cit> . the two genome assemblies detailed herein, with the previously assembled x. maculatus genome, represent a system for assessing allele specific gene regulation and detailing gene-gene interactions within a varied array of xiphophorus interspecies hybrids.

RESULTS
genome sequencing of x. couchianus and x. hellerii
we assembled the genomes of two xiphophorus species, x. couchianus and x. hellerii, in four iterative steps we classify as follows:  assisted,  de novo,  merging and finally  chromosome formatting. our new xiphophorus assemblies show contiguity metrics equivalent to the x. maculatus reference genome . in terms of total assembled bases, the x. couchianus and x. hellerii genomes have 98 % and 102 % of bases assembled in the x. maculatus genome, respectively. our assembly approach used the x. maculatus genome to guide the scaffolding of contigs, but it also included contigs merged from the de novo assembly that could not be aligned as sequences to the x. maculatus genome. the size of the x. hellerii genome is larger than the x. maculatus genome that we suggest is mostly the result of gap filling during assisted assembly and the addition of de novo assembled contigs. the original x. maculatus reference was not gap filled with short sequences. similarly, the higher sequence coverage of the x. couchianus resulted in fewer shorter contigs  and longer n <dig> length. however, simplicity in the genome architecture may also account for these size differences in both cases. although the x. maculatus genome and two newly sequenced genomes were sequenced and assembled from different technologies   <cit> , gc content and other measures of contiguity are very similar across all three. scaffolds of x. couchianus and x. hellerii were then assembled into chromosomes based on the recently published x. maculatus rad-tag chromosome map  <cit> . at the chromosome-level of genomes, the contiguity statistics for the three genomes are very similar. overall, the statistics of newly assembled genomes of x. couchianus and x. hellerii, are comparable to the statistics of the reference x. maculatus genome.table  <dig> assembly statistics of genomes of three xiphophorus species

new advances in sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of genome sequencing but more importantly the algorithms designed to derive assemblies from short sequences has significantly improved. here we show that within a genus high quality assemblies can be cost effectively derived from about half the traditional illumina coverage  for de novo assembly. thus, it is now possible to sequence and assemble all  <dig> remaining extant xiphophorus species with significant cost savings. to provide the two new xiphophorus genomes, we used an approach that combined de novo and reference-guided assemblies. here we show two independent genome assemblies were built with all sequence data, using the soapdenovo <dig> assembler and an assisted assembly from roughly 52x total input sequence coverage in whole-genome shotgun reads, a combination of 30x fragments, and 17x 3 kb, and 5x 8 kb matepairs for x. hellerii; and 51x total sequence coverage in whole-genome shotgun reads, a combination of 29x fragments, 14x 3 kb, and 8x 8 kb matepairs for x. couchianus. it is important to follow our outlined iterative steps to ensure new within genus references are not a mere syntenic reflection of the genome reference used for assisted assembly. therefore, we contend the proliferation of additional genome references within genus can be in most cases at least as high quality as the original reference that serves as a starting point.

annotation of x. hellerii and x. couchianus genomes
after a genome is assembled, the next major challenge is to annotate the genome for gene content. the standard process followed is to rely on publicly available pipelines such as ensembl  <cit>  or ncbi  or to annotate the genome with a tool such as maker  <cit> . the state of the art is to build gene models with prior similarity evidence coupled with rnaseq data for a comprehensive set of gene predictions. although we advocate this approach when feasible, we used an alternative approach that utilized information of gene structure from the x. maculatus reference genome and lifted over all possible gene models to the new genome references. using the ensembl gene annotation of x. maculatus and the ratt annotation transferring tool  <cit> , we produced  <dig>  x. couchianus annotated transcripts with an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, an average length of  <dig>  bp, and a total size of 51 mb . the resulting inferred transcriptome of x. couchianus covers 99 % of the gene number and 97 % of the nucleotides of the x. maculatus transcriptome. using the same method we produced  <dig>  x. hellerii transcripts with a final n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, average length of  <dig>  bp, and a total size of 52 mb . the inferred x. hellerii transcriptome also covers 99 % of gene number and 99 % of nucleotides of the reference x. maculatus transcriptome.table  <dig> statistics of transcriptomes of three xiphophorus species

there are several reasons why the ratt tool fails to transfer some gene models to new genomes. for example, there are  <dig> genes annotated in the x. maculatus genome that were not transferred to x. hellerii. attempts to manually align these gene models failed for  <dig> of them, three of these gene models are located in contig breakpoints,  <dig> of them mapped to multiple locations and the remainder can be aligned but failed one of the quality control steps during ratt transfer. gene models aligned to new genomes but not transferred by ratt may potentially be rescued through manual curation.

the opportunity to obtain a genome reference and corresponding gene set is most desired by biologists. previously, genome annotation required expensive computational effort, yet with the ratt genome annotation approach, the computational demands of annotating a genome are greatly reduced. in our study it requires about  <dig> gb of memory and four days of manual curation steps compared with weeks of gene annotation pipeline based approaches. however, significantly shorter computational times are forthcoming that promise to speed up methods such as maker  <cit> . for the reference-based approach, there is no additional sequencing cost once the genome is sequenced and assembled, but we emphasize it does require a well-developed reference genome from a closely related species.

sequence variations among xiphophorus genomes
in order to determine variants among three xiphophorus genomes, we aligned reads of x. couchianus and x. hellerii to the homologous sequences of x. maculatus reference chromosomes. for x. couchianus,  <dig> , <dig> sncs and  <dig> , <dig> insertions and deleletions  were identified between the x. couchianus and x. maculatus genomes, corresponding to an overall polymorphic rate of about  <dig> base change for every  <dig> bases genome wide. between x. hellerii and x. maculatus, the total number of polymorphisms identified were  <dig> , <dig> sncs, and  <dig> , <dig> indels with an overall polymorphism rate of about  <dig> base in every  <dig> bases. the frequency differences of these differences may be due to the methods utilized to maintain the x. couchianus  and x. hellerii . we then examined the whole genome distribution of polymorphisms along the chromosomes . the polymorphisms are more abundant and evenly distributed between x. hellerii and x. maculatus  than those between x. couchianus and x. maculatus . species-specific polymorphisms were also identified . the genome of x. couchianus  has the fewest species-specific polymorphisms compared to the other two species, reflective of the sibling line breeding origins of this sequenced individual, but the distribution of species-specific polymorphisms along chromosomes are similar in the two platyfish and as expected rates of polymorphisms are higher near the ends of chromosomes. the species-specific polymorphisms in x. hellerii are more evenly distributed.fig.  <dig> distribution of polymorphisms in xiphophorus genome among  <dig> chromosomes. a the histogram rings in the circos plot represent the number of sncs in 100 kb bins normalized by  <dig>  tracks from outside circles to inner circles are polymorphisms between x. maculatus and x. couchianus , between x. maculatus and x. hellerii , only in x. maculatus , only in x. couchianus  and only in x. hellerii . the connecting links in the inner circle show the inter-chromosomal rearrangements between x. maculatus and x. couchianus  and x. maculatus and x. hellerii . b distribution of genes with high impact polymorphisms in the genome. the black, orange, blue and green bars represent the location of all protein coding genes in x. maculatus genome, genes with high impact variants  in x. couchianus relative to x. maculatus, shared genes with high high impact variants between in x. couchianus and x. hellerii relative to x. maculatus, genes with high impact variants in x. hellerii relative to x. maculatus




in a previous study based on de novo assembled transcriptomes, we estimated the frequency of sncs between x. maculatus and x. couchianus to be about  <dig> base in every 700 bp  <cit> , yet an observed  <dig> base in 69 bp polymorphism frequency seen in this study is considerably higher. not surprisingly, base variation is more conserved in protein coding sequences and our sensitivity is elevated as a result of deeper sequence coverage of the entire genome in contrast to the previous method that only considered polymorphisms in the transcribed sequences  <cit> . it will be necessary to further resequence x. couchianus populations to refine our preliminary estimates of genome variation.

structural variation among xiphophorus genomes
in addition to sncs, we also identified inter-chromosomal rearrangements among species. to call an inter-chromosomal rearrangement event, at least a 20 kb sequence from a single de novo assembled contig must be aligned to two different chromosomes. in total,  <dig> inter-chromosomal rearrangement events are found between x. couchianus and x. maculatus and  <dig> events are found between x. hellerii and x. maculatus . there are six times more genomic rearrangement events between x. maculatus and x. couchianus  than between x. maculatus and x. hellerii. this result does not agree with phylogenetic studies indicating x. maculatus and x. couchianus are less evolutionarily divergent. we note the x. couchianus contigs are on average longer than contigs of x. hellerii and thus more likely to detect chromosome breakpoints. with alternative computational methods for detecting large-scale variants based on paired-end reads such as breakdancer  <cit>  and lumpy  <cit>  and the resequencing of population individuals for each species, it should be possible to resolve the presence of large-scale rearrangements relative to the reference in future studies.

single base variation predicted to impact protein function
after identifying polymorphism locations, potential effects of them were predicted based on their relative positions to the annotated gene models and whether amino acid sequences would be expected to be altered . between x. couchianus and x. maculatus, most of the polymorphisms  are not located in the coding regions of transcripts, with intergenic, introns and utrs exhibiting the highest percentages of polymorphisms respectively. only a very small percentage  of high impact polymorphisms  within a species are expected to significantly alter the translated proteins. among these variants, non-synonymous coding changes are most common. interestingly, changes in splice junction sites are also very common, suggesting alternative splicing differences may be common between species. in addition to alternative splicing, alternative transcription start and stop sites are also commonly observed between species. how these many variants modulate protein function warrants further studies.table  <dig> number and percentage of polymorphisms’ effects in x. couchianus and x. hellerii compared with the x. maculatus reference genome

x. couchianus
x. hellerii

athe number of effect is higher than the number of polymorphisms because one polymorphism could cause multiple effects in neighboring genes



the overall landscape of effects of polymorphisms in x. hellerii is very similar to x. couchianus . the overall rate of variants between x. hellerii and x. maculatus is higher than between x. couchianus and x. maculatus, in accord with previous studies that suggest x. hellerii is more distantly related to x. maculatus than to x. couchianus  <cit> .

to test for the distributional randomness of putatively high impact gene variants in the genome, we plotted the coordinates of affected genes . of the  <dig> genes in x. couchianus  and  <dig>  genes  in x. hellerii that have high impact variants relative to x. maculatus, we found the position of genes to be randomly distributed and are correlated with the density of localized gene models . among these genes,  <dig> of them  are shared between species, suggesting fixation in the genus and are of increased scientific interest. to better understand these conserved  <dig> genes with high impact variants in both x. couchianus and x. hellerii, we performed go categorical and kegg pathway enrichment tests. among these genes,  <dig> of them are annotated as uncharacterized proteins and thus prevent further biological inference. for the remaining  <dig> genes, go and kegg pathway enrichment analyses show genes associated with categories that involve regulation of homeostasis  and response to leucine  to be significantly enriched . these results may suggest evolution of the x. maculatus species dietary traits or preferences, or some environmental or physical parameter, that placed selective pressure on x. maculatus to alter its protein composition.

conserved synteny among three xiphophorus genomes
to determine if the assembled x. couchianus or x. hellerii genomes exhibit conserved synteny when compared to the x. maculatus genome, orthologous genes were plotted in the chromosomes of query species  versus the x. maculatus chromosomes. the dot plots generated from this analysis suggest a one-to-one relationship for all  <dig> chromosomes in all three xiphophorus species . although all chromosomes show strong synteny in the three species, evidence of chromosome duplication is observed in many chromosomes. for example, genes from chromosome  <dig> of x. couchianus  and x. hellerii  have orthologues located in chromosome  <dig> of x. maculatus; however, there are many instances where orthologues are also found in chromosome  <dig> of the x. maculatus genome. one-to-one paralogous relationship between two x. maculatus chromosome  was previously observed as result of the teleost genome duplication   <cit> . the commonality of paralogy among chromosomes are also found in other teleost fishes .fig.  <dig> conserved syntenies between xiphophorus species. a the x. couchianus orthologs of chromosome  <dig> tend to lie on x. maculatus chromosome  <dig>  and show conserved syntenic relationship in two species. some orthologs are mapped to other chromosomes of x. maculatus mostly notable chromosome  <dig>  suggesting paralogous chromosomes arising from genome duplication. b the x. hellerii orthologs of chromosome  <dig> behave similarly as x. couchianus orthologs



analyses of transposable elements in xiphophorus genomes
the genome of the platyfish, x. maculatus, was the first to provide an overview of the diversity and content of transposable elements in poeciliid genomes  <cit> . most of the te superfamilies were identified in the different classes and subclasses  and the most active families identified from transcriptome blast analyses were hat transposons and rte  line retrotransposons. the sequencing of two other xiphophorus species provides the ability to perform comparative genomics of tes in closely related species. we took this advantage to complete the te library by including an automatic te detection and to compare the diversity, content and age of tes in the three genomes.

the newly established library contains manually annotated te sequences and repeatscout sequences from the previous project, combined with a repeatmodeler analyses. it includes  <dig>  sequences  and masks about 21 % of the southern platyfish genome . as result some previously missing superfamilies and families were found such as copia. however, these newly identified superfamilies make up a very small percentage of the genome  and are probably remnants of very ancient insertions. the most abundant families are tc-mariner and hat dna transposons that cover about 10 % of the genome, followed far behind by rex-babar and rte retro transposons. as found in our previous study  <cit> , ltr retro transposons compose a very small portion of the genome.table  <dig> statistics of transposable elements in xiphophorus genomes. left panels: genomes without filtration. right panels: genomes after removing small  and divergent  te elements

the x. couchianus and x. hellerii genomes were analyzed using the same library. incomplete sequences in x. maculatus were manually verified or completed before analyses. by comparison, the three xiphophorus genomes seem to be very close in terms of diversity and content of tes  containing  <dig>  % ,  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of tes, respectively.

for the three genomes, te sequences smaller than  <dig> nucleotides and sharing less than 80 % identity with reference sequences from the library were discarded. after filtering, tes comprised about 12 % of the genomes.

to better investigate the potential activity of the different families and the potential age of the sequences, we calculated kimura distances of the inserted copies, with the hypothesis that mutations altering te-inserted copies are neutral . in fig.  <dig>  recently inserted copies are located on the left side of the graph  while older copies are on the right side. the landscape of te-copy distribution along kimura distances is very similar or identical in the three species, especially from k-value  <dig> to  <dig>  this common pattern may represent the ancestral te landscape of the xiphophorus genus while a recent k-value may represent species-specific te activity. a focus on these recent values  highlights the main differences especially in the two first values. indeed, a strong decrease can be observed for x. maculatus compared to others. by this analysis, we also evaluate which superfamilies are still active.fig.  <dig> history of transposable element superfamilies in the three xiphophorus genomes and potential respective current activity. a kimura distances of the different superfamily copies . b focus on first kimura distances highlighting recent copies specific to each species. c spider graph representing the te superfamilies content in the genome  and in the transcriptome 



we also searched for tes in the inferred transcriptomes. we found that  <dig> to 6 % of the transcriptomes are derived of tes. this result is quite similar to the  <dig>  % previously found for x. maculatus  <cit> . the most represented families are tc-mariner and hat, as observed in the genome, followed by jockey, line <dig>  rex-babar and helitron. some superfamilies are not found in the transcriptomes, such as copia retrotransposons.

finally, we represented the quantity  of each superfamily in both the genome and transcriptome, in a spider graph to observe the relationship between genome copy number and te quantity in transcriptomes. in the case of basal transcription, we expect proportionality between the number of copies in the genome and the quantity of copies in the transcriptome. a family with a high copy number in the genome should be highly represented in the transcriptome. in this way, we highlight superfamilies that could be over-represented in transcriptomes compared to their respective quantity in genomes.

at first glance, genome and transcriptome spider graphs look very similar. for the three species, the most abundant superfamilies in the genomes are tc-mariner, hat, l <dig>  rex-babar, pif-harbinger and rte. in transcriptomes, tc-mariner, hat, i-nimb-jockey, l <dig>  rex-babar and helitron are the most represented superfamilies. our spider graphs show that tc-mariner, hat, l <dig> and rex-babar are indeed highly repeated in genomes and represented in transcriptomes. many copies of these families are probably still active since they are located in recent bursts . we can point out interesting cases, as pif-harbinger, piggybac, l <dig>  rte or bel-pao that are more represented in transcriptomes. this is also the case for academ transposons in the southern platyfish. those could be real expression and not basal transcription. however, this requires more rigorous testing. inversely, for jockey and mite, we observe an under-representation in the transcriptomes.

CONCLUSIONS
in the work presented a variety of genomic and transcriptomic resources and methods were employed to sequence, assemble and compare genomes of two new xiphophorus species, x. couchnianus and x. hellerii, with that of x. maculatus jp 163a.

the traditional strength of the xiphophorus experimental model involves the non-biased assessment of genetic inheritance patterns associated with complex phenotypes within intact animals. the high genetic variability among xiphophorus species and capability of producing fertile interspecies hybrids allows inheritance of any observable trait to be followed into individual backcross hybrid progeny.

improvement of genomic capabilities for the xiphophorus genetic system, as undertaken herein, promises to produce new fundamental knowledge regarding shifts in the genetic regulation within interspecies hybrids that produce altered gene expression patterns in complex traits. the genome sequences and assemblies for the species utilized herein  will allow researchers the capability to mechanistically dissect traits that appear among progeny from interspecies crosses between any pair of these three species. for example, interspecies crosses between pairs of these three species are known to produce several distinct experimental models for induction and progression of melanoma  <cit> . the ability to obtain both the genome and transcriptome sequences of both parental species involved in an interspecies cross will allow unequivocal assessment of the expression of every allele, from either parent, within individual f <dig> or backcross hybrid progeny.

the large-scale identification of polymorphisms in genomes provides researchers with resources to further investigate and characterize poeciliid genomes and to provide more precise analyses of genetic diversity and speciation. such information is crucial to identification of key regulators of important complex biological traits, such as the etiology of pigment pattern compartmentalization and adaptation to divergent environmental conditions and stressors. previous studies in xiphophorus have associated several traits to defined dna segments in the genome. the tumor suppressor of interspecies hybrid melanoma, termed diff, or r  <cit> , the p locus, controlling age and size at sexual maturation  <cit> , and the various mechanisms employed by different xiphophorus species for sexual differentiation serve as a few examples of well defined complex traits that can be better understood with structural characterization of the genomic regions from new species. historically, the lack of good genetic markers has prevented fine mapping the structural regions harboring loci associated with these interesting biological events. the newly sequenced and assembled genomes and ample polymorphisms identified present opportunity to define the size of the effective genomic regions and to highlight gene candidates. altogether, the benefits of having three high quality genomes may represent a key to finding answers of many long-standing biological questions in xiphophorus.
