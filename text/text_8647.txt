BACKGROUND
attesting to the importance of inflammation in disease, a trans-nih inflammation working group was formed recently to collect input on proposed research areas within the overarching theme of "inflammation as a common mechanism of disease"  <cit> . in general, inflammation plays a role in most bladder pathologies, including bladder cancer  <cit> , and represents a defensive reaction to injury caused by physical damage, chemical substances, micro-organisms, or other agents  <cit> . in particular, several lines of evidence suggest that neurogenic bladder inflammation involves the participation of mast cells and sensory nerves. we previously demonstrated a key role for mast cells and their products in bladder inflammation  <cit> . as a consequence of inflammation, products of mast cell degranulation, such as tryptase, can be found in the urine of both bladder cancer and cystitis patients  <cit> . in addition to tryptase, other serine proteases, such as thrombin and trypsin, are produced during tissue damage and make important contributions to tissue responses to injury, repair, cell survival, inflammation  <cit> , and pain  <cit> . tissue responses to these enzymes are modulated by protease-activated receptors , a unique class of g protein-coupled receptors that use a fascinating mechanism to convert an extracellular proteolytic cleavage event into a trans-membrane signal. these receptors carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by receptor cleavage .

four pars have been cloned so far, and all are co-expressed in the mouse bladder urothelium  <cit>  and human urothelial cells  <cit> . in addition to the urothelium, par <dig> and par <dig> are also expressed in mouse detrusor muscle, and par <dig> is expressed in mouse peripheral nerves and plexus cell bodies  <cit> . the expression of pars is altered during inflammation  <cit> . additional evidence for the participation of pars in the bladder inflammatory response was the finding that known pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as lps, substance p, and antigen challenge, induce an increase in par <dig> rna within hours of stimulation  <cit> . moreover, up-regulation of par protein levels have been shown to be part of rat bladder responses to cyclophosphamide  <cit> .

par1- and to a lesser extent par2-deficient mice exhibit a reduced response to bladder inflammation induced by e. coli lipopolysaccharide , substance p, and antigen  <cit> . the latter indicate that these receptors are upstream of a cascade of events leading to bladder inflammation  <cit> . in addition, regardless of the pro-inflammatory stimuli, the urinary bladder inflammatory transcriptome includes a sub-set of genes that are dependent on par activation  <cit> .

despite the evidence of par involvement in inflammation, pain, healing, and cancer in animal models, there seems to be no published clinical study regarding the efficacy of par antagonists. in order to search for therapeutic targets other than receptors themselves, we set forth to determine the transcription factors downstream of par activation as the next step in elucidating the network of responses at the molecular level to par activation. for this purpose, we introduced a new approach for the study of the transcriptional regulation downstream par activation . this top-down approach started by selecting a candidate tf out of  <dig> different tf consensus sequences present in a protein/dna combo array . next, par-induced alteration in this tf binding was validated by emsa and ihc was used to confirm its expression in the urinary bladder. finally, an antibody recognizing this tf was used for chip/q-pcr assay and revealed up-regulation of downstream genes.

methods
animals
all animal experimentation described here was performed in conformity with the "guiding principles for research involving animals and human beings" . genetically mast cell-deficient wbb6f1-kitw/kitw-v and normal c57bl/ <dig> mice were purchased from jackson laboratories .

induction of cystitis
acute cystitis was induced as we described previously  <cit> . briefly, 8– <dig> week old female mice were anesthetized with isoflurane using a precision vaporizer, then transurethrally catheterized , and the urine was drained by applying slight digital pressure to the lower abdomen. the urinary bladders were instilled on two consecutive days with  <dig> μl of one of the following substances: par-activating peptides . all peptides were used at  <dig> μm concentration  <cit> . substances were infused at a slow rate to avoid trauma and vesicoureteral reflux  <cit> . to ensure consistent contact of substances with the bladder, infusion was repeated twice within a 30-min interval and a 1-ml tb syringe was maintained on the catheter end retaining the intravesical solution for at least  <dig> hour. afterwards, the catheter was removed and the mice were allowed to void normally. twenty-four hours post the second instillation, animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation and bladders were rapidly removed and frozen for immunohistochemistry or placed in cold pbs with protease  and phosphatase inhibitors  for separation of the urothelium/submucosa away from the detrusor smooth muscle.

separating the mucosa from the detrusor smooth muscle  <cit> 
to decrease the complexity of using whole bladder homogenates, the bladder mucosa was separated from the detrusor smooth muscle, as described  <cit> . briefly, immediately after removal from the animal, bladders were placed in pbs with protease inhibitors on ice and visualized under a dissecting microscope  and the detrusor smooth muscle was separated by blunt dissection away from the mucosa which contained the epithelium and sub-epithelial layers. isolated layers were flash frozen and stored at -80°c until processing. tissues were pulverized in a spring-loaded tissue pulverizer  and chilled with liquid nitrogen. nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared using the pierce ne-per kit that enables stepwise separation and preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from bladder tissue, as described  <cit> . addition of the first two reagents  to the pulverized tissue causes disruption of cell membranes and release of cytoplasmic contents. after recovering the intact nuclei from the cytoplasmic extract by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes, the nuclei are lysed with a third reagent  to yield the nuclear extract. extracts obtained with this product generally have less than 10% contamination between nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions – sufficient purity for most experiments involving nuclear extracts. a western blot was prepared using the nuclear and cytosolic extracts and probed for the nuclear proteins histone h <dig> and lamin a/c. no nuclear contamination was shown in the cytosolic fractions . protein concentrations were determined with a micro bca kit  per manufacturer's instructions.

minimum information about microarray experiments – miame  <cit> .

objective
to determine the transcriptional regulatory elements  downstream of the activation of par receptor. for this purpose, female c57bl <dig> mice  were instilled two times,  <dig> minutes part, with: control peptide, par1-ap, par2-ap, or par4-ap, every other day for  <dig> days. all peptides were used at  <dig> μm concentration. mice were euthanized  <dig> hours after the last instillation and the urinary bladders were isolated, and the mucosa was separated from the detrusor muscle, as described above.

array design
nuclear extracts from the bladder mucosa were obtained as detailed below for emsa assays and analyzed by protein/dna combo arrays containing  <dig> unique consensus-binding sequences per array  <cit> .

hybridization
to investigate the relative binding of tres to their unique consensus sequences, we used the transsignal protein/dna combo array with spin column preparation  from panomics   <cit> . array analysis was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions using nuclear extracts from mouse bladders before and after exposure to par-aps or control peptide. nuclear extracts were prepared using the panomics nuclear extraction kit  as per the manufacturer's instructions. fifteen micrograms of nuclear extract were isolated before and after challenge, and they were incubated with  <dig> μl of transsignal probe mix  containing  <dig> biotin-labeled double-stranded dna oligonucleotides. tfs bound to the double-stranded oligonucleotides were recovered by using the panomics spin column. the biotin-labeled oligonucleotides specifically bound to the tres were eluted and hybridized to the transsignal array membrane containing oligonucleotides  overnight at 42°c. the blots were then washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase -conjugated streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions. the resulting spots were visualized on a fluorchem imager . the images were quantified with alphaease fc software  and the results were analyzed as described below.

data normalization and analysis
we used the same methodology developed for analysis of cdna microarrays  <cit> . briefly, the raw data obtained with all panomic membranes was first queried to determine only tfs expressed above background, as described for cdna microarrays, and each expressed data was then log <dig> transformed. in addition, pairs of groups  were adjusted to all data and then to each other using a robust regression analysis. normalization was conducted using an iterative nonlinear curve-fitting procedure, as described  <cit> . this procedure assumes that intensities corresponding to tfs not expressed by the tissue will be normally distributed, and computes the mean and standard deviation . next, we normalized each expression profile to its own background . for further analysis, data obtained after normalization of each profile to its own background were log-transformed with substitution of negative values by the minimal logarithmic value obtained within positive values. next, a robust regression analysis was conducted on expressed tfs. this analysis was based on the fact that, in a linear regression analysis between two compared samples, the majority of tfs are equally expressed and, therefore, randomly distributed around the regression line with a small portion of differentially expressed "outliers." the contribution of outliers to the regression analysis was down-weighted in an iterative manner. all expression profiles of both control and experimental groups were then rescaled to a common standard: the averaged profile of the control group. our procedure for outlier exclusion was based on the selection of equally expressed tfs with close to normal distributed residuals . only transcriptional factors exhibiting a ratio greater than  <dig>  between control and treated groups are being presented.

electrophoresis motility assays 
a commercially available double-stranded tfeb probe corresponding to the adenovirus major late promoter core sequence  was constructed by end-labeling a double-stranded probe with γ32p atp  and t <dig> polynucleotide kinase  and then purified using a g- <dig> column . a second probe corresponding to the μe <dig> immunoglobulin enhancer site  was also tested but it was found to have a much lower binding affinity as previously described by others  <cit>  .

nuclear extracts  from the bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle were placed in  <dig> mm tris hcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm edta, 5% glycerol,  <dig> % np- <dig>   <dig> μg poly di-dc,  <dig> mm dtt with protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added to  <dig>  cpm labeled tfeb consensus oligonucleotide and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. cold reactions contained 100× unlabeled tfeb consensus oligonucleotide. for super-shift reactions,  <dig> μg of nuclear extract was pre-incubated for  <dig> minutes on ice with  <dig>  μg tfeb antibody . reactions were resolved on a 5% native acrylamide gel with  <dig>  × tbe at  <dig> v for  <dig> hours. gels were vacuum-dried and visualized on kodak biomax ms film and quantified using imagej software   <cit> .

tfeb immunofluorescence
frozen bladders were processed for routine immunohistochemistry according to published methods  <cit> . all reagent incubations and washes were performed at room temperature. normal blocking serum  was placed on all slides for  <dig> min and sections were incubated with primary antibody  at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml. controls include omission of the primary antibody. slides were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies . slides were washed, counterstained with dapi and coverslipped with shur/mount  mounting media. all tissues were imaged at room temperature using axiovision  <dig>  and a zeiss axiocam hrm high-resolution ccd camera. selected sections were visualized and photographed using a zeiss lsm <dig> laser scanning confocal with meta . tfeb fluorescence was analyzed in triplicate by image analysis of the urothelial cell layer. images were analyzed with image-pro analyzer®  and the area expressing positive cells for tfeb at 200× magnification was calculated as percent of the total urothelial cell area. results are presented as average and standard error of the mean.

target validation by q-pcr of chromatin immunoprecipitation -based assays
target validation was sought for  <dig> genes known to have an e-box based on the evidence on the literature  or our own observation eif4ebp <dig>  <cit> . female c57bl/6j mice  were anesthetized , and instilled on two consecutive days with  <dig> μl of one of the following substances: par2-ap  or control inactive peptide . twenty-four hours after instillation, mice were euthanized with pentobarbital  and the whole bladders removed rapidly and frozen.

frozen bladders were shipped to genpathway  <cit>  for querying the chromatin for detection and quantification of tfeb binding upstream of specific genes using chromatin immunopreciptation  combined with real time pcr    <cit> . the whole bladders, contained both the mucosa and detrusor layers, were exposed briefly to formaldehyde for cross-linking of the proteins and dna together, followed by sonication to fragment the dna into pieces of approximately 300– <dig> bp. the same tfeb antibody used for ihc  was then used to precipitate the tfeb-dna complexes. the ab-protein-dna complexes were purified using beads coupled to protein g. the dna was isolated from the complexes using a combination of heat to reverse cross-linking, rnase and proteases, and then purified using phenol extraction and etoh precipitation. the final chip dnas were then used as templates for q-pcr reactions using primer pairs specific for each genomic region of interest. q-pcr was carried out using taq polymerase . primer pairs were designed using primer  <dig>  <cit> . details of the primer sequences and the genebank accession numbers are given in table  <dig>  the designed primers shared 100% homology with the target sequence but no significant homology with other sequences.

q-pcrs reactions were run in triplicate and the averaged ct values were transferred into copy numbers of dna using a standard curve of genomic dna with known copy numbers. the resulting tfeb binding values for each genomic region were also normalized for primer pair amplification efficiency using the q-pcr values obtained with input dna . results are presented as binding events detected per  <dig> cells for each genomic region tested and compared to an untranscribed region used as a negative control. the difference between two mean values was analyzed with an unpaired student's t-test . a nominal p value less than  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

materials
par1-ap, par2-ap, and par4-ap and control peptide were synthesized at the molecular biology resource facility, william k. warren medical research institute, ouhsc, as carboxyl-terminal amides, purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectroscopy. peptide solutions were made fresh in pbs from powder. par3-ap was not used in this research because of lack of specificity.

RESULTS
protein/dna combo array
par1-activating peptide , par2-ap, par4-ap, and control peptide were instilled into the mouse bladder at the concentration of  <dig> μm. this treatment induces a strong and reproducible bladder inflammation, whereas no inflammation was observed in mice instilled with  <dig> μm control peptide  <cit> . we used a protein/dna combo array that separated bound dna/protein complexes from unbound probe. the biotin-labeled probe/protein was hybridized to a membrane containing  <dig> transcription factor consensus sequences. as this assay closely resembles the membrane cdna arrays, we used the same methodology developed by our collaborator  to analyze the results  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the tfs that were at least 3-fold up-regulated and figure  <dig> represents those tfs that were 3-fold down-regulated by each par-ap. table  <dig> summarizes all tfs. the relative magnitude of the different tf signals between par-aps is illustrated in figure  <dig>  these results strongly suggested that tfeb, a member of the mitf family of bhlh-zip transcription factors, was the only tf commonly altered by par1-ap, par2-ap, and par4-ap and therefore, occupied the center of venn diagram .


absence of par-induced bladder inflammation in c-kit-deficient mice
direct evidence for an essential role for mast cells in cystitis was reported by our laboratory in animal models of bladder inflammation  <cit> . however, the responses to par-aps were not investigated. therefore, we compared the bladder inflammatory responses to par1-ap in wild type and kitw/kitw-v mice. as shown in figure  <dig>  par1-ap induces inflammation in wild type mice, consistent with our previous published results  <cit> . this inflammation was characterized by intense inflammatory infiltrate in the submucosa and vasodilation . in contrast, kitw/kitw-v did not develop an inflammatory response to par <dig> activation .

electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
we used the same binding sequence present in the panomics array  <cit> , as the tfeb emsa probe. our results indicate that intravesical instillation of c57bl/ <dig> mice with all par-aps increased the binding activity to the tfeb probe primarily in extracts of the bladder mucosa . in contrast, no significant increase was observed in mast cell deficient kitw/kitw-v mice challenged with par1-ap . in addition to tfeb, other members of the microphthalmia -tfe subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper  transcription factors are known to bind to this e-box sequence  <cit> . therefore, we used a tfeb antibody to reveal a specific tfeb activity, as illustrated by the super shift bands in tissues isolated from c57bl/ <dig>  and kitw/kitw-v mice . next, we determined the variability of the emsa by performing additional experiments in tissues isolated from c57bl/ <dig> mice that were challenged with the control peptide and par1-ap , figure  <dig>  imagej software was used to quantify the emsa signals and the integrated density is presented on figures 13a–c

target validation by q-pcr of chromatin immunoprecipitation -based assays
in order to investigate whether the increased expression of tfeb would translate into an up-regulation of genes known to contain an e-box on their promoter, we used a combination of chromatin immunopreciptation  and real-time polymerase chain . for this purpose, we used the same tfeb antibody employed for ihc. chip was obtained from the whole bladder isolated from par2-ap- and control peptide-treated bladders. we queried the expression of selected genes known to have an e-box on their promoter and compared the results with an un-transcribed region of the dna. figure  <dig> indicates an increased number of events  on the chip precipitated with tfeb antibody when compared to the un-transcribed region for the following genes: e-cadherin, eif4bp <dig>  serpine  <dig>  igf1r, and cyclin d <dig>  in addition, inflammation associated with par <dig> stimulation led to an up-regulation of serpine  <dig>  wt <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  igf1r, and cathepsin k.

discussion
we used a top-down approach for determination of transcription factors involved in the response of the mouse bladder to pro-inflammatory par-aps . first, a protein/dna combo array was used to select transcription factors common to all par activation. out of  <dig> tfs present in this array, only tfeb was shared by par1-, par2-, and par <dig> activation. next, we confirmed that tfeb is expressed in the mouse bladder by ihc. finally, we compared the inflammatory responses to par1-ap between wild type and mast cell-deficient kitw/kitw-v mice. kitw/kitw-v mice failed to mount an inflammatory response to par1-ap, and emsa confirmed that tfeb is upregulated by all par-aps in wild type mice but not in kitw/kitw-v mice. finally, we used a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and qpcr to target validate transcripts known to be under the control of tfeb. this assay takes into consideration genes that are actively transcribed, in contrast to cdna array technologies that queries rna accumulation. the disadvantage of the chip/q-pcr method is the amount of chromatin necessary for chip, which limits this analysis to the whole bladder and not to specific layers  used for emsa. therefore, our chip/q-pcr results have to be taken in the context that migrating inflammatory cells, in addition to resident cells, contributed to the measured values. these results indicate that tfeb is downstream of par activation, that this response occurs primarily in the bladder urothelium, and that tfeb mobilization depends on the presence of either mast cells or alternatively c-kit receptors, which are expressed on a variety of tissues, including certain nerves. given our previous findings demonstrating the importance of mast cells in bladder inflammation and our finding of mitf expression, we speculate that the mast cell is the key contributor to this response, but further studies will be necessary to delineate the precise mechanism of tfeb mobilization.

tfeb belongs to the microphthalmia -tfe subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper  transcription factors which includes four family members: tfeb, tfe <dig>  tfec, and mitf. mitf family members are required for the proper development of osteoclasts, melanocytes, retinal pigment epithelial cells, mast cells, and natural killer cells  <cit> . in addition, mitf has been implicated in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression in mast cells  <cit> .

each protein of the mitf family forms homo- or heterodimers with other family members  <cit>  and recognizes, in general, the same dna sequences  <cit> . in particular, tfe <dig> and tfeb elicit their effects mainly through the binding to m-box  and e-box motifs   <cit> .

mitf family in the urinary tract
the only other finding implicating this family in the urinary tract is their involvement in renal cell carcinoma. in this regard, tfe <dig> is involved in chromosomal translocations recurrent in renal cell carcinoma  <cit> . translocations of the genes encoding the related transcription factors tfe <dig> and tfeb are almost exclusively associated with a rare juvenile subset of renal cell carcinoma and lead to over-expression of tfe <dig> or tfeb protein sequences. tfe <dig> and tfeb have been identified as cell type-specific leukemia inhibitory factor-responsive activators of e-cadherin  <cit> .

mitf and mast cells
mitf mrna and protein levels are higher in human mast cells than monocytes and granulocytes  <cit> . mitf seems to be involved in the migration, phenotypic expression, and survival of mast cells  <cit> . as an essential transcriptional effector of the c-kit pathway, mitf is critical for mast cell  <cit>  and melanocyte development  <cit> . mice deficient in mitf harbor a severe mast cell deficiency, and mitf-mutant mast cells cultured ex vivo display a number of functional defects  <cit> . in addition, c-kit- and m-csf-dependent mapk phosphorylation transcriptionally activates both tfe <dig> and mitf, which is necessary for mast cell developmental functions  <cit> . our findings indicate that the bladder inflammatory responses mediated by par <dig> are dependent on the presence of mast cells by a mechanism that involves tfeb. the latter adds to a list of evidence published by this laboratory indicating that kitw/kitw-v mice do not develop bladder inflammation in response to antigen challenge  <cit> , and substance p  <cit>  stimulation, whereas reconstitution kitw/kitw-v with mast cells from wild type mice restores the inflammatory response  <cit> . therefore, we did not test whether the responses mediated by par <dig> and par <dig> are also dependent on the presence of mast cells.

pars and mitf
thrombin and tryptase are endogenous agonists of pars in humans. along with serine proteases, it seems that tissue factor and element of the coagulation cascade are also endogenous activators of pars  <cit> . in human vascular endothelial cells both thrombin and par1-ap elicited gene regulation via e-box signaling  <cit> . however, the information regarding endogenous activators of pars in the mouse bladder is, unfortunately, scanty. while human connective tissue mast cells contain the enzymes chymase and tryptase, mice contain numerous related proteases  <cit> . mouse mast cell protease- <dig> is a tryptase predominantly expressed in differentiated connective tissue-type mast cells  <cit> . mast cell proteases mcpt- <dig> , and the tryptases mcpt- <dig> and mcpt- <dig> are all expressed during the development of the mouse embryo  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information regarding which particular tryptase is expressed in the mouse bladder and/or upregulated in the mouse model during inflammation. although thrombin is a recognized physiological activator of par <dig> and par <dig>  the endogenous enzymes responsible for activating par <dig> in urinary bladder are not known. recently, it was demonstrated that the kallikrein family of proteinases are able to regulate par signaling and may represent important endogenous regulators par <dig>  par <dig>  and par <dig>  <cit> . the latter are likely to be confirmed in the urinary tract, since members of the kallikrein family play a fundamental role in bladder physiology  <cit> . it is interesting to note that activation of pars on the bladder urothelium leads to activation of one of the members of the mitf family. others have shown that mast cell tryptase and mitf are highly sensitive and specific markers for mast cell disease  <cit> . moreover, mitf regulates the expression of mouse tryptases, such as mcpt- <dig>  <cit>  and mcpt- <dig>  in response to stem cell factor  <cit>  or transforming growth factor-beta stimulation  <cit> .

involvement of mast cells and pars in bladder inflammation
mast cells are strategically located for optimal interaction with the environment and for their putative functions in host defense  <cit> . among the mast cell mediators, tryptase is expressed by most human mast cells comprising as much as 25% of the cells' protein  <cit> , and it is released in response to inflammatory stimuli  <cit> . indirect evidence for a role of mast cells in cystitis was reviewed in ref.  <cit>  and includes increased concentration of tryptase in the urine of interstitial cystitis  patients  <cit> , presence of mast cells containing tryptase in the bladder of ic patients  <cit> , and that mast cell counts in ic patients are one of the few features significantly associated with night-time frequency . we published direct evidence that mast cells are essential for both bladder inflammation and gene-regulation in experimental cystitis  <cit> . our publications show that bladder inflammation is induced in normal mice and not in mast cell-deficient kitw/kitw-v mice. the differences observed were abolished when kitw/kitw-v mice had their mast cell deficiency selectively repaired by transplantation of bone marrow-derived mast cells from the normal congenic +/+ mice  <cit> . as the bladder response in these mice is similar to the normal +/+ mice, we concluded that mast cells are essential for the development of cystitis  <cit> .

pars provide an answer to the question of how mast cell products, such as tryptase, produce signals and induce bladder inflammation. recently, we characterized the bladder responses to par-aps and presented evidence of a mandatory role for pars in experimental cystitis  <cit> . we went further to determine the regulatory network downstream of pars  <cit> . our present findings further emphasize that products of mast cells such as tryptase inducing activation of pars can lead to increased activity of transcription factors such as tfeb that play a fundamental role in mast cell survival. this positive feedback loop might be responsible for the mast cell-dependent perpetuation of bladder inflammation. however, the precise mechanisms involved in this feed back remain to be determined. one possibility is that the mast cells themselves express pars and are susceptible to par-ap activation  <cit> . indeed, par1-ap induces mast cell adhesion to fibronectin  <cit> . in contrast, messenger rna for par- <dig> was detected in peritoneal mast cells  <cit> , but par-aps failed to induce histamine release from these cells  <cit> . another possibility is that inflammatory mediators can modulate the mast cell sensitivity to par-aps. indeed, inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig> were suggested to regulate par receptor expression on the mast cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing tfeb expression in response to par activation in the bladder and suggest a unifying, mechanistic pathway of bladder inflammation as follows: we hypothesize that mast cells release tryptase resulting in increased par activation and, consequently, tfeb/mitf activity. as a result of increased of mitf activity in mast cells there is mmcp- <dig> and mmcp- <dig> synthesis, leading to additional signals for inflammation. the findings that tfeb is downstream of activation of all pars, makes this transcriptional factor a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the bladder.
