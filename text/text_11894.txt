BACKGROUND
valve defects are among the most common congenital heart defects, and are associated with significant health problems and mortality throughout life  <cit> . their exact incidence is unknown because many valve defects are not diagnosed until adulthood  <cit> . aortic valve defects alone occur in 1-2 % of the population  <cit> . the prevalence of adults with valvular heart disease is increasing, due to improved surgical treatments and increases in lifespan that may be accompanied by valve degeneration  <cit> . congenital valve defects and adult valve disease may not be distinct, since structural or biomechanical abnormalities in the valves may be present but not readily appreciated at birth. the heart valves form by remodeling embryonic structures called endocardial cushions. outgrowth of the cushions occurs via localized expansion of extracellular matrix  between the endocardium and myocardium in the atrioventricular canal  and outflow tract , after which the cushions are cellularized by invasion of a subpopulation of endocardial cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition   <cit> . at post-emt stages, this cushion mesenchyme differentiates into valve interstitial cells, specialized fibroblasts that produce the highly stratified matrix of the mature valves  <cit> . the mitral and tricuspid valves form from the avc endocardial cushions, while the aortic and pulmonary valves arise from the oft cushions  <cit> .

transforming growth factor β  signaling induces endocardial cushion emt in both birds and mammals, although the roles of specific tgfβ paralogs differ . in chick, tgfβ <dig> is required for activation of the endocardial cells, in which cell polarity and cell-cell contacts are lost, and tgfβ <dig> is required for invasion of the transformed mesenchymal cells into the cushion matrix  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> is not expressed in the developing cushions. both tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig> are produced in the myocardium prior to the onset of emt, and tgfβ <dig> is found in the endocardium during stages of active emt  <cit> . autocrine production of tgfβ <dig> in the cushion endocardium is essential for induction of invasive mesenchyme  <cit> . in mouse, tgfβ <dig> is not expressed in the heart until e <dig> , well after emt is underway, and is restricted to the mesenchymal cells of the cushions  <cit> . no cardiac malformations have been found in tgfb3-null mice  <cit> . tgfβ <dig> has an expression pattern in the mouse heart that is similar to that of tgfβ <dig> in chick, and inhibition of tgfβ <dig> blocks invasion in mouse avc explants  <cit> . tgfb2-null mice exhibit impaired emt, hypocellular cushions, and a variety of valve and septal defects  <cit> . thus, in mouse tgfβ <dig> plays a role orthologous to that of chick tgfβ <dig>  tgfβ <dig> is also expressed in mouse avc endocardium, and although it is not essential for endocardial cushion emt in vivo, tgfb1-null mice have disorganized valves  <cit> .

we previously identified a role for muscleblind-like  <dig>  in the regulation of tgfβ-dependent emt in the endocardial cushions in chick  <cit> . mbnl <dig> is a member of the mbnl family of rna binding proteins that regulate pre-mrna alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, microrna biogenesis, mrna stability and localization . we previously reported that in the embryonic chicken heart mbnl <dig> transcripts are found in the atrial and ventricular myocardium, and in the endocardium of the avc and oft endocardial cushions during emt and immediately prior to its onset  <cit> . we demonstrated that knockdown of mbnl <dig> in chick avc or oft explants promotes invasive mesenchyme formation ex vivo  <cit> . this effect is dependent upon tgfβ <dig>  and is accompanied by precocious and elevated secretion of active tgfβ <dig> by the endocardial cells  <cit> . early exposure to excess tgfβ <dig> is sufficient to induce precocious and elevated invasion in avc explants  <cit> . these data suggested that mbnl <dig> negatively regulates emt in the endocardial cushions by limiting the levels and timing of inductive, autocrine tgfβ signaling.

in this study, we investigate the role of mbnl <dig> in mouse endocardial cushion development and valvulogenesis. we demonstrate that high expression of mbnl <dig> in the endocardial cushions is conserved in mouse. using mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice, which are null for mbnl <dig> protein, we show that loss of mbnl <dig> promotes invasive mesenchyme production in avc explants ex vivo and precocious tgfβ signaling and emt in the avc in vivo, but does not lead to an excess in total mesenchyme production. in the fetal mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> heart, however, valve morphogenesis is aberrant. in the adult heart, mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice continue to exhibit valve dysmorphia, accompanied by elevated tgfβ signaling and changes in ecm composition. significant regurgitation was observed across both inflow and outflow valves. mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice also have a high incidence of ostium secundum atrial septal defects and increased valve pigmentation. taken together, these data indicate that mbnl <dig> is required for normal heart valve development and function in vivo.

RESULTS
mbnl <dig> is expressed in the endocardial cushions and mature heart valves
to determine whether mbnl <dig> expression in the endocardial cushions is conserved in mammals, we performed immunohistochemistry on sections from mouse hearts at different stages of development. as in the chicken heart, mbnl <dig> was strongly detected in the myocardium and avc endocardium at e <dig>  prior to the onset of emt . mbnl <dig> is broadly expressed throughout the embryo, but is not ubiquitous; for example, although mbnl <dig> protein is strongly detected in the ectodermal linings it is low or absent in the interior cephalic tissues of the mid-, fore-, and hindbrain . at e <dig> , when emt is well underway, intense nuclear mbnl <dig> staining was observed in the endocardium and mesenchyme of the avc and oft cushions . strong nuclear mbnl <dig> staining persists in the immature valves at late fetal stages  and in the mature valves of the adult heart . mbnl <dig> was also seen in the developing myocardium, where it is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm . in the adult myocardium, mbnl <dig> staining is more diffuse and cytoplasmic , consistent with previous reports that mbnl <dig> is more strongly detected in cytoplasmic than nuclear extracts from whole hearts at postnatal stages  <cit> .fig.  <dig> mbnl <dig> is highly expressed in the endocardial cushions and heart valves. immunohistochemistry with an anti-mbnl <dig> antibody was performed on sagittal sections from wild type mouse embryos  and coronal sections of adult hearts . representative sections from one of four embryos or one of two adult hearts are shown. a close-up of the heart at e <dig> stained with the secondary antibody alone is shown as a negative control. b close-up of the heart at e <dig> shows expression of mbnl <dig> in the early myocardium and endocardium of the nascent endocardial cushions just prior to the onset of emt. c close-up of the heart at e <dig>  shows strong mbnl <dig> expression in the endocardial cushions of the avc and oft. higher magnification views of the boxed regions in the endocardial cushion  and the ventricular wall  show intense nuclear staining in the cushion endocardial cells, but more diffuse staining in the myocardium. intense nuclear mbnl <dig> staining persists in the fetal valves at e <dig>   and mature heart valves , while mbnl <dig> remains more diffusely distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in the myocardium. asterisks highlight accumulations of melanin in the adult valve. h western blot analysis confirms high mbnl <dig> expression in the adult heart, and suggests different cardiac tissues may express different mbnl <dig> isoforms. protein integrity and loading were assessed by ponceau s staining. a representative of three independent blots with similar results is shown. atr = atrium, vent = ventricle, ec = endocardial cushion, oft = outflow tract, tc = tricuspid valve, val = heart valves



by western blot, mbnl <dig> is expressed in adult heart valves at levels comparable or higher than levels in the chambers . interestingly, slightly different mbnl <dig> isoforms were detected in the different compartments of the heart, with the slowest migrating isoform in the valves and the fastest in the ventricles. alternative splicing of mbnl <dig> transcripts can lead to the generation of several different mbnl <dig> protein isoforms, ranging in size from  <dig> to 43 kda  <cit> . we and others previously reported that inclusion or skipping of exon  <dig>  <cit>  affects the subcellular localization of mbnl <dig> protein such that the larger exon-included form is predominantly nuclear whereas the exon-skipped form is both nuclear and cytoplasmic . although preferential inclusion of exon  <dig> in the heart valves would explain both its strong nuclear localization and its slower migration, we found that exon  <dig> is in fact ~95 % skipped in adult mouse heart valves, atria, and ventricles .

loss of mbnl <dig> has a transient stimulatory effect on emt in the endocardial cushions ex vivo
we previously demonstrated that knockdown of mbnl <dig> in chick h&h stage  <dig> avc explants promotes invasive mesenchyme production ex vivo, indicating that mbnl <dig> is a negative regulator of endocardial cushion emt  <cit> . to determine if this role is conserved in mammals, invasive mesenchyme production was compared in avc explants from wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts . indeed, e <dig> explants from mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice had more invaded cells than wild type explants. in chick, the effects of mbnl <dig> knockdown are temporally regulated, such that knockdown of mbnl <dig> induces increased invasion in stage  <dig> avc explants, but has no significant effect in stage  <dig> avc explants  <cit> . likewise, the number of invaded cells in avc explants from e <dig>  mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice was similar to that of wild type e <dig>  explants . thus, both the stimulatory effect of loss of mbnl <dig> on emt and its temporal regulation are conserved between birds and mammals.fig.  <dig> loss of mbnl <dig> stimulates emt ex vivo in a stage-specific manner. images of wild type  or mbnl1

∆e3/∆e <dig> avc explants and the levels of active tgfβ proteins secreted into the media were assayed by elisa



in chick stage  <dig> avc explants, elevated levels of active tgfβ <dig>  but not tgfβ <dig>  are secreted into the medium following mbnl <dig> knockdown  <cit> . in chick, tgfβ <dig> is required for invasion of mesenchymal cells, whereas tgfβ <dig> is required for endocardial cell activation  <cit> . tgfβ signaling is also important for endocardial cushion emt in mammals, but with some differences in ligand specificity . to determine whether the levels of active tgfβ secreted by mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc cushions differed from those of wild type, we collected conditioned media from wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc explants and measured the levels of active tgfβ <dig>  tgfβ <dig>  and tgfβ <dig> by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  . there was a trend towards higher levels of all three tgfβ proteins, but differences did not reach statistical significance. this may be attributable in part to the detection limits of the assay, as the measured levels of tgfβ proteins were very low, and we failed to detect any tgfβ in some supernatants from both wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> explants.

loss of mbnl <dig> leads to precocious emt and tgfβ signaling in the endocardial cushions in vivo without a persistent increase in total mesenchyme production
in chick stage  <dig> avc explants, knockdown of mbnl <dig> stimulates precocious and elevated levels of active tgfβ <dig> secreted into the medium, and early exposure to elevated tgfβ <dig> levels is sufficient to induce precocious invasion  <cit> . the level of invasion induced at the earlier stage by loss of mbnl <dig> is similar to that of control explants from the later stage in both chick and mouse  <cit> , consistent with an accelerated induction of invasion. emt normally begins in the mouse avc cushions at e <dig>   <cit> , and indeed no invaded cells were observed in heart sections from wild type embryos at e <dig>  . in contrast, histological analysis of mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> embryos revealed the presence of invaded cells within the avc cushions already at e <dig> , suggesting that mbnl <dig> prevents precocious mesenchyme formation both ex vivo and in vivo. to determine whether tgfβ signaling is precociously activated in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc cushions in vivo, we performed immunohistochemistry using an antibody against phosphorylated smad <dig> , a mediator of canonical tgfβ signaling. in wild type hearts, high psmad <dig> levels were seen in a small number of avc cushion endocardial cells at e <dig>  . in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts psmad <dig> was strongly detected in nearly all cells in the avc endocardium  by e <dig> , resembling psmad <dig> staining in wild type hearts at e <dig> . this indicates that the precocious production of invasive mesenchyme in the absence of mbnl <dig> is accompanied by precocious tgfβ signaling.fig.  <dig>

to determine whether the precocious induction of invasion leads to an over-production of cushion mesenchyme in vivo, the numbers of invaded cells in the avc cushions were counted in serial sections from e <dig>  wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> embryos . despite the early initiation of emt in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc cushions, there was no significant difference in the relative amount of avc mesenchyme once emt is well underway . imaging of e <dig>  hearts using optical coherence tomography  confirmed that mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc cushions are indeed similar in size and shape to wild type . overt differences in cushion cellularity were also not observed in sections of wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts at e <dig> , e <dig> , or e <dig>  . thus, although mbnl <dig> restricts the timing of emt initiation in the avc cushions, it is not essential for regulating the total amount of mesenchyme produced in vivo.

loss of mbnl <dig> has little effect on emt in the avc cushions at e <dig> 
at e <dig> , abundant psmad <dig> staining is seen throughout the endocardium and mesenchyme of both wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc cushions . to evaluate emt-associated gene expression in the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> avc cushions at this stage, the levels of  <dig> genes that either change their expression during emt or that regulate gene expression changes during emt were assessed by real-time rt-pcr on total rna from wild type or mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> e <dig>  avc cushions using epithelial to mesenchymal transition rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays . tgfβ transcript levels were not affected , although it should be noted that increases in the levels of active tgfβ <dig> secreted by chick avc explants following mbnl <dig> knockdown occurred without an accompanying increase in tgfb <dig> transcript levels  <cit> . consistent with equivalent amounts of mesenchyme production, both endothelial markers such as versican  and e-cadherin , which are down-regulated during emt, and mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin  and matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> , which are up-regulated during emt, did not differ between wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> cushions. important transcriptional regulators of emt such as snai <dig>  snai <dig> , and twist <dig> also do not differ between wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> cushions. only four genes  differed significantly between wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> cushions by at least two-fold . zinc-finger e-box binding homeobox  <dig> , a transcription factor that interacts with activated smad proteins to promote emt in response to tgfβ signaling  <cit> , is down-regulated more than three-fold. microphthalmia-associated transcription factor , which negatively regulates smad-dependent tgfβ signaling in mast cells  <cit> , is up-regulated approximately two-fold. bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  levels are also doubled in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> cushions. while neither bmp <dig> nor bmp <dig> alone are essential for endocardial cushion development, double-knockout mice lacking both bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> exhibit delayed formation of the oft cushions and defects in valve morphogenesis  <cit> . finally, the glycoprotein secreted phosphoprotein  <dig> , also known as osteopontin, is elevated more than three-fold. transcription of spp <dig> is induced by both tgfβ and bmp signaling  <cit> , so its up-regulation could be due to elevated tgfβ signaling or to the up-regulation of bmp <dig> or both. repression of spp <dig> is required for prevent matrix mineralization in the developing heart valves  <cit> , and elevated spp <dig> levels are associated with calcific valve disease in mice and humans . thus, while these results suggest that tgfβ signaling is precociously activated in the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> cushions, it is unclear whether elevated tgfβ signaling is maintained once emt is underway. unfortunately, the small size and lack of cellularity in the cushions at e9- <dig>  makes collecting enough avc cushion tissue for a similar analysis during the initiation of emt untenable.fig.  <dig> epithelial to mesenchymal transition rt <dig> profiler pcr arrays reveal few changes in gene expression in mbnl1

heart valve morphogenesis is aberrant in fetal mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts
the continued expression of mbnl <dig> in the endocardial cushions and heart valves at post-emt stages  suggests that mbnl <dig> may play additional roles in heart valve development beyond regulating the timing of the onset of emt. transformation of the endocardial cushions into the heart valves is a complex process involving expansion and condensation of the mesenchyme, differentiation of mesenchymal cells into valve interstitial cells, and changes in the composition and organization of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . heart valve remodeling in the mouse occurs between e <dig>  and e <dig> . to determine whether heart valve morphogenesis is altered in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice, we compared the three-dimensional structures of fetal valves in e <dig>  wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts using oct. we chose to focus on the pulmonary valve because this valve is the most accessible at e <dig>  for imaging by this method. in the e <dig>  wild type heart, the pulmonary valve is globular . although the boundaries of the individual leaflets cannot be resolved due to their tight apposition, three distinct lobes roughly aligned in the same plane are readily appreciated. in contrast, in the e <dig>  mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> heart, the pulmonary valve is highly dysmorphic and its leaflets are not aligned within a single horizontal plane .fig.  <dig> loss of mbnl <dig> leads to valve dysmorphia in the fetal heart. three-dimensional representations of the pulmonary valve at e <dig>  reconstructed from optical sections of a representative wild type  and three different mbnl1

∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts shown in  were stained with movat’s pentachrome stain. scale bars in panels c-n represent 100 μm



next, the pulmonary, aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves were compared in sections from wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> e <dig>  hearts by histology . in four of eight mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> e <dig>  hearts, but none of three wild type hearts, anucleate, eosinophilic tissue connecting the valve leaflets to the vessel or chamber wall was observed in one or more valves by hematoxylin and eosin staining . in nearby sections, this eosinophilic connective tissue stained bright red with movat’s pentachrome stain, indicative of fibrin. consistent with the oct results, apparent misalignment of valve leaflets was also seen to a variable degree in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig>  but not wild type, hearts. thus, in the absence of mbnl <dig> the remodeling of the endocardial cushions into the heart valves is aberrant in the fetal heart.

loss of mbnl <dig> results in changes in the matrix composition and tgfβ signaling in adult heart valves
histological analysis also revealed valve dysmorphia in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice. whereas wild type inflow valves stain predominantly blue with masson’s trichrome stain due to their high collagen content, collagen-poor swellings sparsely populated with small, unstained, stellate cells were seen in some sections from mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts . although these swellings occurred in both the mitral and tricuspid valves, they were larger and more common in the tricuspid valve. these swellings are reminiscent of those seen in periostin-null mice  <cit> , although other defects characteristic of periostin-null valves such as loss of collagen, failure of delamination, and improper remodeling of the associated myocardium were not observed. in the mature valve, the ecm is stratified into three highly organized layers: the collagen-rich fibrosa, proteoglycan-rich spongiosa, and elastin-rich atrialis   <cit> . although this stratification appears relatively normal in the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves by movat’s pentachrome staining, there is reduced mucin staining in the spongiosa layer in the regions of the swellings, indicative of a loss or dilution of the proteoglycans in these sites . using an antibody against chrondroitin sulfate, lower levels of total chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  expression were observed in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves . when cspg transcript levels were compared by real time rt-pcr, however, aggrecan, versican, decorin, and biglycan showed no difference, whereas brevican and neurocan were actually higher in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves . it is possible that the apparent loss of cspgs in the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves is due to reduced production or attachment of the sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains to the core proteins rather than a decline in proteoglycan expression per se. the ecm protein fibronectin is highly expressed in the endocardial cushions and valve precursors, but is down-regulated during maturation  <cit> . although fibronectin transcript levels did not differ between wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> cushions at e <dig>  , fibronectin transcript levels were elevated in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves by real-time rt-pcr . elevated levels of fibronectin protein were also seen in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves by western blot , and accumulations of fibronectin were seen in the tricuspid valve by immunohistochemistry .fig.  <dig> loss of mbnl <dig> leads to changes in matrix composition and tgfβ signaling in the heart valves. a high magnification view of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve on a coronal section of an adult mbnl1

western blot analyses also revealed higher levels of psmad <dig> in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves compared to wild type , indicating elevated levels of tgfβ signaling in the adult valves. unlike precocious activation of tgfβ signaling in the endocardial cushions, this is accompanied by an up-regulation of tgfb <dig>  though not tgfb <dig> or tgfb <dig>  mrna levels in the knockout valves .

loss of mbnl <dig> leads to valve regurgitation and atrial septal defects
to determine whether heart valve function is compromised by loss of mbnl <dig>  transthoracic echocardiography was performed on approximately 22 week old wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice. color-flow and 2d-pulsed doppler revealed a high incidence of regurgitation across the pulmonary, aortic, and mitral valves in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice ; blood flow across the tricuspid valve was not assessed. in contrast, no regurgitation was observed across the aortic or mitral valves in wild type mice. although mild regurgitation was observed across the pulmonary valve in some wild type animals, it was less common and less severe than that observed in the knockout animals .table  <dig> incidence of valve regurgitation and atrial communication in wild type versus mbnl1

in addition to regurgitation, atrial communication was observed in several of the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice, but only one of their wild type counterparts, by color and pulsed doppler . anatomical dissection of male and female mice ranging in age from 10 weeks to one year-old confirmed the presence of a patent foramen ovale in 50 % of mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts, but less than 10 % of wild type hearts . even when successfully closed, the foramen ovale was noticeably enlarged in some mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts, but not in wild type . since atrial communication would not occur in these cases, however, there is unlikely to be any functional defect. closure of the foramen ovale occurs in mice within the first week of postnatal life when the septum primum fuses with the septum secundum  <cit> . when examined at late fetal stages, the foramen ovale was markedly enlarged in sections of some mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts . the infolding of the atrial roof at the superior margin  and the flap valve  appear normal in these hearts, but the muscular base of the primary atrial septum where the flap valve is anchored appears reduced. ostium secundum defects can result from either a failure to fully form the septum secundum, or from a failure of the septum primum to cover the entire oval fossa  <cit> . this histological analysis suggests the latter, not the former, is the reason for the high incidence of foramen ovale patency and atrial communication in the knockout mice. in other fetal mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts, the foramen ovale and its associated structures look similar to wild type . no other septal defects were observed in wild type or knockout hearts.fig.  <dig>

it has previously been reported that the closely related paralog, mbnl <dig>  can compensate for loss of mbnl <dig> in the myocardium. mbnl <dig> protein levels are elevated in the hearts of mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice  <cit> . mbnl <dig> and mbnl <dig> recognize similar rna elements  <cit> , and mbnl <dig> binding to mbnl targets increases when mbnl <dig> is absent  <cit> . restoring mbnl <dig> to near wild type levels in mbnl1-null mice by removal of one mbnl <dig> allele was sufficient to induce atrial dilation, ventricular hypertrophy, and conduction defects  <cit> . in these compound knockout mice mbnl <dig> levels were assessed in whole heart, however, leaving it unclear whether mbnl <dig> was elevated specifically within the myocardium, which comprises the majority of the heart by volume, or in all cells that normally express mbnl <dig>  we tested whether loss of mbnl <dig> results in increased mbnl <dig> levels within the heart valves by western blot and real-time rt-pcr . we found that mbnl <dig> protein levels were higher in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves, although mbnl <dig> transcript levels remained unchanged, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation at the level of translation or protein stability. thus, the up-regulation of mbnl <dig> is not restricted to muscle tissue. the presence of valve dysmorphia and regurgitation in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice, however, indicates that unlike in the myocardium, higher levels of mbnl <dig> are insufficient to fully compensate for loss of mbnl <dig> in the heart valves.

pigmentation is increased in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> heart valves
during dissection and collection of heart valves from adult wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts, we observed a greater amount of pigment in valves from the knockout mice . the presence of cardiac melanocytes in murine heart valves has been well documented . lineage tracing studies have demonstrated that these melanocytes are derived from invading neural crest cells, and normally populate the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves, but not the pulmonary valve  <cit> . we saw an increase in the presence of pigmentation in both inflow and outflow valves in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts, including one instance of pigment in the pulmonary valve . in order to compare the amount of pigment in wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves, we developed a pigmentation scoring system  in which each valve was given a score of  <dig>  to  <dig> . in addition to an increased incidence of pigmentation, we also saw an increase in the amount of pigment within pigmented valves . the level of pigmentation has been shown to correlate with coat color in mice  <cit> . all of our wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice are on the b <dig> background, a hybrid of c57bl/ <dig> black mice and  <dig> albino mice, and have either brown or black coats. the incidence and relative amount of pigmentation in wild type or mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves were the same regardless of coat color , so data from brown and black mice were pooled in the graphs in fig.  <dig>  despite these differences in pigmentation, wild type and mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves express similar levels of dopachrome tautomerase , a marker of the melanoblast lineage found in melanocytes and their precursors, and tyrosinase related protein  <dig> , a marker of differentiated melanocytes .fig.  <dig>

discussion
the present study demonstrates that mbnl <dig> is required for normal heart valve development and function. mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice, which lack mbnl <dig> protein, have valve dysmorphia, alterations in ecm composition, and regurgitation across both inflow and outflow valves. loss of mbnl function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy , a multisystemic genetic disorder characterized by a number of cardiac, muscle, endocrine, and neurological defects  <cit> . dm is caused by the expression of mutant rnas containing expanded cug  or ccug  repeats, which leads to the dysregulation of other transcripts in part through the sequestration of mbnl proteins . notably, dm patients exhibit a variety of cardiac abnormalities, including a high incidence of mitral valve prolapse  <cit> . mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice recapitulate many of the features of dm, including skeletal muscle myotonia and cataracts  <cit> , but a valve phenotype had not previously been described. valve dysfunction in dm patients has generally been assumed to be a consequence of myopathy, caused by weakness of the papillary muscles to which the inflow valves connect  <cit> . although mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice do not exhibit overt cardiomyopathy, loss of mbnl <dig> function in the papillary muscles could predispose the mice to tricuspid and mitral valve failure. this would not explain differences in function of the aortic and pulmonary valves in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice, however, which are free standing. the expression of both mbnl <dig> and mbnl <dig> in wild type adult heart valves argues instead for a direct function of mbnl proteins in heart valve homeostasis. suggestively, mbnl <dig> is one of sixteen genes within a locus on chromosome  <dig> that has been genetically linked with mitral valve prolapse  <cit> , although to date no studies have corroborated a role for mbnl <dig> in valve disease. both nuclear and cytoplasmic roles of mbnl proteins have been implicated in dm pathogenesis, including regulation of pre-mrna alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, microrna biogenesis, mrna localization and stability  <cit> . it remains to be determined which of these roles are essential in the developing valves.

we previously showed that knockdown of mbnl <dig> in chicken endocardial cushion explants enhanced autocrine tgfβ <dig> and invasive mesenchyme production ex vivo in a stage-dependent manner  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that loss of mbnl <dig> has a similar effect in mouse endocardial cushion explants ex vivo. in chick explants, activation  and invasion  are easily distinguishable steps of emt; unfortunately, in mouse endocardial cushion explants activation is not readily apparent, as cells appear to invade directly from the explant into the collagen gel  <cit> . thus, although we saw a stage-dependent increase in the number of invaded cells in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> explants, we cannot say whether invasion per se is specifically stimulated as we observed in the chick  <cit> . loss of mbnl <dig> stimulates precocious tgfβ signaling and emt in mouse endocardial cushions in vivo, which is also consistent with our previous finding that knockdown of mbnl <dig> in chick endocardial cushion explants stimulates precocious secretion of active tgfβ <dig> in vitro  <cit> . this effect is temporary in the mice, however, as the amount of total mesenchyme produced is normalized by e <dig> , and few changes in emt gene expression are observed at this stage. taken together, these data suggest that mbnl <dig> regulates the initiation of emt, but not its progression. the dysmorphia and presence of abnormal connective tissue in the fetal valves indicates a developmental role for mbnl <dig> in valvulogenesis; if not regulating the amount of cushion mesenchyme, then perhaps influencing its fate during valve maturation.

the stratification of the adult valve suggests that matrix remodeling is relatively unimpaired in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice. the presence of collagen/proteoglycan-poor swellings sparsely populated with stellate cells, however, indicates localized increases in matrix with an atypical composition. indeed, while cspgs levels are reduced, the ecm protein fibronectin is strongly up-regulated. the maintenance of stratification and the specific changes in ecm composition observed in the adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves are not characteristic of either myxomatous valve degeneration or calcific valve disease. the persistence of fibronectin in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves could be indicative of incomplete or defective differentiation of the cushion mesenchyme in the knockout mice. mbnl <dig> has recently been shown to regulate alternative splicing changes that are important for stem cell differentiation  <cit> , and mbnl <dig> has been implicated in the differentiation of skeletal muscle, blood, lens, and adipose cells . alternatively, elevated fibronectin expression in the adult valves could be indicative of injury to the valves, perhaps due to changes in shear stress caused by altered valve biomechanics. valve interstitial cells have been shown to up-regulate fibronectin in response to injury in primary cultures  <cit> . the accumulation of fibronectin in the adult valve may in turn then have a detrimental effect on valve function by altering the valve’s elasticity or stiffness.

the higher levels of fibronectin in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves could also potentially have a protective effect. we found that both tgfb <dig> transcript levels and tgfβ signaling  are elevated in the adult knockout valves. elevated tgfβ <dig> levels are associated with calcification in stenotic valves, and addition of tgfβ <dig> is sufficient to induce calcification in valve interstitial cells in culture  <cit> . we have observed no signs of overt calcification in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves, however, even in animals as old as 90 weeks . notably, fibronectin has been shown to protect cultured valve interstitial cells from tgfβ1-induced calcification  <cit> . the mechanisms by which tgfβ <dig> and fibronectin are up-regulated in adult mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves, and the extent to which mbnl <dig> exerts its effects in the mature valve through modulation of the ecm and/or tgfβ activity, remain to be determined.

the relevance of increased pigmentation in the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> heart valves is unclear. pigmented cells were first observed in the mouse heart over fifty years ago  <cit> . although gene expression profiling suggests these cardiac melanocytes are more similar to cardiomyocytes than canonical melanocytes found in the skin, these neural crest-derived cells express melanocyte markers and produce melanin in non-albino mice . dct-expressing cells have also been reported in human heart valves, although these cells lack tyrp <dig> and are not pigmented  <cit> . the purpose of these cells is not well understood. one suggestion has been that the enzymes within the melanin synthesis pathway buffer calcium and reactive species in the heart  <cit> . melanin is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine in a multistep process in which dct converts the intermediate dopachrome into  <dig> -dihydroxyindole carboxylic acid , which is then converted into eumelanin by tyrp <dig>  <cit> . the normal levels of dct and tyrp <dig> in the mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> valves suggests that the increase in pigmentation is not due to an increase in the number of melanocytes in the valves, or an up-regulation in these steps of melanin production. little is known about melanin turnover. the accumulation of pigment in the heart valves is associated with stiffening of the valves, regurgitation, and stenosis in patients with alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine metabolism characterized by ochronosis, the accumulation of pigment within the connective tissues . an ex vivo nanomechanical study of mouse tricuspid valves reported that pigmented regions of the tricuspid leaflet are stiffer than regions lacking pigment  <cit> . thus, increased pigment in the valves of mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice could contribute to their functional impairment by altering their biomechanical properties.

the impact of loss of mbnl <dig> in the heart is not confined to the developing valves. many mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice had ostium secundum defects. a strong association between ostium secundum defects and mitral valve prolapse has been documented  <cit> . examination of the fetal heart prior to closure revealed that the septum secundum, which forms from infolding of the atrial roof at the superior margin, and the septum primum, which forms the flap valve, appear normal in the knockout mice. the muscular base to which the flap valve is anchored, however, is smaller in some mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> hearts. the muscular base of the atrial septum arises from myocardialization of mesenchyme within the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion , a derivative of the secondary heart field, not the endocardial cushions  <cit> . underdevelopment of the dmp can be caused by reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, or premature myocardialization of the dmp mesenchyme  <cit> . mutations in several genes, including cardiac transcription factors such as nkx <dig> , gata <dig>  and tbx <dig>  have been linked to atrial septal defects and foramen ovale patency in humans , but their precise roles in the development and maturation of the dmp are not known. often, defects in the dmp are associated with more severe atrioventricular septal defects, but these, or other types of septal defects that arise from defective remodeling of the endocardial cushions, are not observed in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice. although atrial communication can lead to right atrial overload and other cardiac complications, stand-alone ostium secundum defects are often clinically benign  <cit> .

the lack of overt cardiomyopathy in mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice despite both atrial communication and poor valve function might initially be surprising, but it should be noted that these mice also experience progressive skeletal muscle myotonia  <cit> . as mbnl1∆e3/∆e <dig> mice age and their myotonia worsens, their level of activity decreases, which may help reduce their cardiac burden. the up-regulation of mbnl <dig> may also help the strained heart muscle compensate  <cit> . it has also been reported, however, that mbnl1-knockout mice on a pure  <dig> sv genetic background  exhibit progressive cardiac dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial cell death and fibrosis despite a similar up-regulation of mbnl <dig>  <cit> . the difference in heart muscle pathogenesis between the mouse strains suggests the existence of modifier genes that modulate the function of mbnl <dig> in the heart. mbnl1-dependent heart valve phenotypes have not been investigated on a pure  <dig> background.

CONCLUSIONS
mbnl <dig> is highly expressed in the endocardial cushions and heart valves. it plays a conserved role in regulating the onset of tgfβ signaling and emt in the endocardial cushions, but is not essential for limiting the total amount of cushion mesenchyme production in vivo. mice lacking mbnl <dig> exhibit defects in valve morphogenesis, ecm composition, function, and pigmentation, indicating that mbnl <dig> is required for normal post-emt valve development.
