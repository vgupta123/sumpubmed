BACKGROUND
following the proliferation of primordial germ cells, oogonia enter meiosis circa embryonic day  <dig>  and are then referred to as oocytes in the embryonic mouse ovary. oocytes in the embryonic ovary exist in clusters, surrounded by epithelial pre-granulosa cells  <cit> . germ cell cyst breakdown results in the envelopment of individual oocytes by flat granulosa cells to form primordial follicles. primordial follicles contain small oocytes  surrounded by flat granulosa cells. these early steps in the formation of primordial follicles are critical, since primordial follicles constitute the fundamental reproductive units of the ovary and give rise to all dominant follicles. primordial follicle activation  is a process by which primordial follicles are selected into the growing follicle pool  <cit> . morphologically, pfa is characterized by oocyte growth to greater than  <dig> μm and transition of the flat epithelial layer to cuboidal granulosa cells. pfa is independent of gonadotropins  <cit> , occurs prior to puberty, and is spontaneously observed when an ovary is transplanted or cultured in vitro  <cit> . several groups have shown the importance of the ubiquitous pi3k-akt-mtorc <dig> pathways within oocytes in regulating pfa . conditional ablation of foxo <dig>  pten, and tsc1/ <dig> in oocytes triggers massive oocyte activation  <cit> . activated oocytes in these animals survive beyond  <dig> weeks, perhaps not surprising given the importance of this pathway in regulating apoptosis and cell death.

the role of oocyte-specific pathways in oocyte activation is unknown. lhx <dig> encodes a highly conserved lim homeodomain protein that is preferentially expressed in mammalian ovaries, including human ovaries  <cit> . female mice with global lhx <dig> deficiency are infertile and rapidly lose oocytes after birth  <cit> ; so great is the loss in lhx <dig> global knockout that few oocytes remain by postnatal day  <dig>  to study the postnatal role of lhx <dig> in oocyte activation, we conditionally ablated lhx <dig> in oocytes of primordial follicles . our results indicate that lhx <dig> represses oocyte activation and plays a dominant role over pten-led pathways in oocyte survival. lhx <dig> depletion in primordial oocytes decouples oocyte activation from somatic differentiation. moreover, lhx <dig> directly regulates lin28a expression and indirectly interacts with the pi3k-akt pathway to effect repression of pfa. furthermore, unlike the pten pathway, we found that conditional deletion of lhx <dig> from oocytes of primary follicles  causes primary follicle death and depletion of the secondary/antral follicle pool.

RESULTS
conditional depletion of lhx <dig> by gdf9cre causes massive primordial follicle activation
we previously reported that global knockout of lhx <dig> causes infertility and loss of oocytes by postnatal day  <dig>   <cit> . in the global knockout of lhx <dig>  primordial-like follicles form , but oocytes do not grow. since lhx <dig> is expressed in both embryonic and postnatal female germ cells, it is possible that global knockout of lhx <dig> disrupts early embryonic pathways that lead to postnatal oocyte depletion. we therefore investigated the postnatal functions of lhx <dig> by generating a conditional knockout mouse, using a floxed lhx <dig> allele   <cit>  and a gdf9cre transgenic mouse  <cit> . the gdf9cre transgene will inactivate lhx <dig> specifically in primordial oocytes. gdf9cre is highly efficient in oocytes and, when present in either lhx8flx/flx or lhx8flx/- animals, displayed the same ovarian phenotype. we used lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre to study the effects of lhx <dig> conditional deficiency in primordial follicles on ovarian development.

at pd <dig> and pd <dig>  lhx <dig> protein was depleted in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries and massive oocyte activation occurred in the primordial follicles, as manifested by oocytes reaching a diameter greater than  <dig> μm without significant transformation of the surrounding flat granulosa cells . at pd <dig>  lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre mice had  <dig> ±  <dig> activated primordial follicles per ovary compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> per ovary in lhx8flx/flx controls. the number of primordial follicles was  <dig> ±  <dig> per ovary in lhx8flx/flx controls and was significantly reduced to  <dig> ±  <dig> per ovary in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre mice . we detected a decline in primary follicles in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre mice, implying a block in the transition from activated primordial follicles to primary follicles. there were a negligible number of advanced follicle types  in pd <dig> lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries, compared to the lhx8flx/flx controls.fig.  <dig> postnatal inactivation of lhx <dig> causes premature activation of primordial follicles and ovarian failure. a and b anti-lhx <dig> antibodies were used to detect oocytes in paraformaldehyde-fixed and hematoxylin-counterstained ovaries taken at postnatal day  <dig> . ovaries were derived from control  and lhx <dig> conditional knockout  mice. arrowheads in the inset of panel a indicate primordial follicles that stain with anti-lhx <dig> antibodies . arrowheads in the inset in panel b show activated primordial follicles . d, e, g and h periodic acid–schiff  staining of pd <dig>  and pd <dig>  ovaries derived from control  and lhx <dig> conditional knockout  mice. arrowheads in the inset of panels d and e indicate primordial activated primordial follicles. c, f and i quantification of ovarian follicle types in lhx8

at pd <dig>  lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries contained  <dig> ±  <dig> activated primordial follicles per ovary, compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> per ovary in lhx8flx/flx controls. the number of primordial follicles significantly diminished from  <dig> ±  <dig> in lhx8flx/flx controls to  <dig> ±  <dig> in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries . by pd <dig>  the total number of follicles from primordial to secondary was greatly diminished in the lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovary . by pd <dig>  there were barely any oocytes and follicles detected in the lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovary  and lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre females were sterile . our studies show that postnatal inactivation of lhx <dig> within oocytes of primordial follicles leads to massive oocyte activation, decoupling of oocyte activation from somatic cell transformation, oocyte death, and infertility.

lhx <dig> interacts with pi3k-akt pathway
we examined rna expression of genes that encode important members of the pi3k-akt-mtor pathways in pd <dig> lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre oocytes. real-time polymerase chain reaction  did not detect significant changes in the expression of pten, akt, foxo <dig>  pdk <dig>  mtor, rps <dig>  deptor, rictor, or tsc1/ <dig> . these results indicate that lhx <dig> does not directly affect transcription of a subset of genes known to encode proteins in the pi3k-akt-mtor pathways. then we assessed whether the pi3k-akt pathway was activated at the protein level in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre oocytes. akt is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a key role in apoptosis and pfa. phosphorylated akt activates multiple downstream pathways, including foxo <dig> phosphorylation, resulting in oocyte activation  <cit> . western blot analyses on oocytes from pd <dig> ovaries showed that phosphorylation of akt at two sites, s <dig> and t <dig>  was higher in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre oocytes than in controls . but interestingly, only p-akt  was detected in the activated primordial follicles .fig.  <dig> akt is activated in lhx8

previous studies have shown foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation and rps <dig> phosphorylation via the pi3k-akt-mtor pathways to be associated with pfa  <cit> . we examined foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation and rps <dig> phosphorylation in pd <dig> pten and lhx <dig> conditional knockouts . foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation was prominent in oocytes larger than  <dig> μm but did not show obvious translocation among oocytes between  <dig> and  <dig> μm in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre mice . oocytes of primordial follicles in pten and lhx <dig> conditional single knockouts as well as corresponding controls did not show foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation. however, foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation was significantly induced in the primordial  oocytes  of the pd <dig> double lhx8/pten conditional knockouts . these data indicate a synergistic action of the lhx <dig> and pten proteins on foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation.fig.  <dig>

gdf9cre mice, the extensive nucleocytoplasmic translocation is not observed in activated primordial follicles between  <dig> and  <dig> μm  but is noted in activated primordial follicles larger than  <dig> μm . d–i a similar expression pattern of foxo <dig> localization exists in pten conditional knockout  mice. the arrows in i' represent primordial follicles  with both nuclear and cytoplasm expression of foxo <dig> and cytoplasm expression of foxo <dig> in activated primordial follicles  below  <dig> μm. j–l however, in mice that are conditionally deficient in both lhx <dig> and pten , foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation is present in primordial, activated, and primary oocytes. the negative control is immunofluorescence in the presence of secondary antibodies and is shown in m–o. the boxed areas in c, f, i, l, and o are shown magnified in c', f', i', l', and o'. p graphic representation of foxo <dig> distribution . oocytes were grouped by size  as less than  <dig> μm, between  <dig> and  <dig> μm, and greater than  <dig> μm. only oocytes with clear dapi nuclear staining were counted. scale bars:  <dig> μm ;  <dig> μm 



we also examined the effects of double pten and lhx <dig> deficiency on rps <dig>  mtorc <dig> promotes protein translation and cell growth, in part, through activation of s6k <dig>  and through phosphorylation and inactivation of eif4e-binding proteins. s6k <dig> is responsible for phosphorylation and activation of rps <dig>  which leads to enhanced protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. in control, lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre, and ptenflx/flxgdf9cre ovaries, rps <dig> was only significantly activated in growing follicles at pd <dig> . however, the pd <dig> lhx8flx/flxptenflx/flxgdf9cre ovaries showed significant activation of rps <dig> in primordial  oocytes . these results further indicate that the lhx <dig> and pten pathways synergistically interact to accelerate two events associated with pfa—foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation and phosphorylation of rps <dig> 

lin28a rna and protein expression are upregulated in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre oocytes
lhx <dig> is a transcription factor, and we expect that its major effect will be at the rna level. we therefore analyzed the transcriptome of lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries via high-throughput rna sequencing . we sequenced  <dig> million tags in each sample and compared the relative abundance of rna tags encoded by genes in the pi3k-akt-mtor pathways derived from pd <dig> lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre and control ovaries. no significant differences in rna expression of pi3k-akt-mtor pathway genes  were evident in the rna-seq experiment .

in addition to analyzing the expression of known pi3k-akt-mtor genes, we studied global differences in the transcriptome of lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre and control ovaries. we detected a sixfold increase in lin28a rna transcripts in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre compared to control ovaries . immunofluorescence and western blot analysis with anti-lin28a antibodies showed that lin28a protein was expressed at a significantly higher level in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre oocytes compared to the controls .fig.  <dig>

lin28a is an rna-binding protein that blocks biogenesis of let- <dig> micrornas and a known regulator of mammalian body size and metabolism, including onset of menarche  <cit> . lin28a is preferentially expressed in oocytes and embryo stem cells  <cit> . moreover, the pi3k-akt-mtor pathways can be activated by lin28a  <cit> . lin28a, therefore, may play a role in oocyte activation and growth.

lhx <dig> can directly bind to the lhx <dig> dna binding motif in the lin28a promoter
we tested whether lhx <dig> can bind to the lin28a promoter. lhx <dig> is an oocyte-specific lim homeodomain transcriptional regulator that is predicted to bind dna. a previous study showed that the lhx <dig> homeodomain preferentially binds a tgattg dna motif  <cit> . we identified a single tgattg dna motif − <dig> to − <dig> bp upstream of the putative transcriptional initiation site in the lin28a gene . the lin28a tgattg motif is conserved in other mammals, including humans. we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiment on wild-type oocytes, using our highly specific and affinity purified anti-lhx <dig> antibodies  <cit> . anti-lhx <dig> antibodies preferentially immunoprecipitated the lin28a promoter dna fragment containing the tgattg motif . these data further suggest that lhx <dig> represses lin28a expression by directly binding to the lin28a promoter.

lin28a deficiency partially rescues the lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre phenotype
our data indicates that lhx <dig> suppresses lin28a expression. since lin28a is a growth-promoting factor  <cit>  preferentially expressed in oocytes, we hypothesized that lin28a deficiency will rescue lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre-induced pfa. we bred lin28a and lhx <dig> floxed mice with gdf9cre to generate lhx8/lin28a double conditional knockouts .

we performed ovarian morphometric analyses to determine the effects of the double knockout on pfa. no morphometric difference was observed between lin28aflx/flxgdf9cre and control females at pd <dig> . as expected, we observed significantly fewer activated primordial follicles in lhx8flx/flxlin28aflx/flxgdf9cre compared to lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries, but they were not completely normal compared with the control .fig.  <dig>

the partial rescue of lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre-induced pfa by lin28a deficiency argues that lin28a is a regulator of oocyte growth. the diminished number of activated primordial follicles in lhx8flx/flxlin28aflx/flxgdf9cre ovaries suggests that akt pathway activation is also diminished. we assayed the p-akt  signal in primordial and activated primordial follicles of lhx8flx/flxlin28aflx/flxgdf9cre and lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries  and found its expression was significantly reduced in the lhx8flx/flxlin28aflx/flxgdf9cre ovary compared to the ovaries of lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre mice.

lhx <dig> regulates the primary to secondary follicle transition
previous studies have shown that pten-regulated pathways are important in primordial oocyte activation, but not in primary oocytes  <cit> . we studied the role of lhx <dig> in primary oocytes by generating lhx8flx/flxzp3cre mice. zp3cre is specifically expressed in primary oocytes, and lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovaries continue to express lhx <dig> in primordial, but not primary, oocytes. morphometric analyses revealed that the lhx8flx/flxzp3cre conditional knockout ovaries did not significantly differ from lhx8flx/flx  mice at pd <dig> and pd <dig> . however, at pd <dig>  we counted  <dig> ±  <dig> primary follicles and  <dig> ±  <dig> secondary/antral follicles per ovary in the lhx8flx/flxzp3cre mice, compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> primary follicles and  <dig> ±  <dig> secondary/antral follicles per ovary in the control mice . the relative increase of primary follicles at pd <dig> and the relative decrease of multilayer follicles in the lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovary indicated that the transition from primary follicles to secondary follicles was blocked, which was consistent with the observation in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre mice . at pd <dig> and pd <dig>  we observed that many primary follicles were devoid of oocytes . we stained for lin28a in pd <dig> ovaries and found that lin28a was strongly expressed in lhx <dig> deficient oocytes of the lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovary, but no expression was detected in the empty follicles . however, excluding these empty primary follicles, the number of primary follicles between control and lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovaries was not significantly different at pd <dig> or pd <dig> . for secondary/antral follicles, the number sharply dropped to  <dig> ±  <dig> at pd <dig> and to  <dig> ±  <dig> at pd <dig> in lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovaries, compared to  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig>  respectively, in control mice. these findings imply that the growing follicle pool continued to be eliminated from the lhx8flx/flxzp3cre mice. lhx8flx/flxzp3cre mice were infertile  and superovulation treatment of lhx8flx/flxzp3cre mice did not produce oocytes . this result was in accord with the sharp fall of secondary/antral follicles in the lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovary at pd <dig>  taken together, these data show that the folliculogenesis of lhx8flx/flxzp3cre mice is blocked in the transition from the primary to secondary follicle stage and results in primary oocyte death and infertility. the relative stability of the primordial follicle pool from pd <dig> to pd <dig> suggests that the pfa into primary follicles was not affected by the diminution in the number of secondary and more advanced ovarian follicles in lhx8flx/flxzp3cre ovaries.fig.  <dig>

discussion
early folliculogenesis in mammals is one of the least understood frontiers in ovarian follicle biology. primordial follicles in mice form shortly after birth and remain dormant for prolonged intervals until individual follicles resume growth via little-understood mechanisms of pfa. several breakthrough studies have highlighted the importance of the pi3k-akt-mtorc pathways in pfa . the kit receptor mediates the action of the pi3k-akt-mtorc pathways  <cit> . moreover, recent studies show that the hippo pathway is also involved in pfa  <cit> . these ubiquitous pathways clearly play important roles in many biological processes and tissues, including oocytes. the role of oocyte-specific pathways in pfa, however, is less clear.

our previous studies on global knockouts of lhx <dig> showed rapid loss of oocytes shortly after birth  <cit> . the expression of lhx <dig> is specifically confined to oocytes and commences during the meiotic prophase in the embryonic gonad and persists in primordial, primary, and antral oocytes during both early development and adulthood. to eliminate any effects of lhx <dig> deficiency in the embryonic gonad, we utilized floxed lhx <dig> mice and the efficient gdf9cre and zp3cre mice  <cit>  to delete conditionally lhx <dig> alleles in the oocytes of primordial and primary oocytes, respectively. our results show that lhx <dig> represses the earliest stage of pfa, oocyte activation, and is crucial for the differentiation of primary follicles.

the massive pfa caused by depletion of lhx <dig> is somewhat reminiscent of the pi3k-akt-mtorc <dig> activation caused by conditional deletion of its inhibitors, pten  <cit>  and tsc <dig>  <cit> . however, unlike the pi3k-akt-mtor related experiments, lhx <dig> appears to act earlier as shown by the decoupling of oocyte activation and somatic cell transformation from flat to cuboidal granulosa cells, by earlier loss of oocytes from lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries, and by lhx <dig> being upstream of the kit receptor  <cit> . pten antagonizes pi3k, and removal of pten activates akt, which in turn, phosphorylates a wide range of intracellular targets, including foxo <dig>  foxo <dig> is a specific target of the akt pathway, and foxo <dig> phosphorylation via akt is thought to cause foxo <dig> nuclear export and pfa. our studies show that cross-talk exists between lhx <dig> and the pi3k-akt-mtorc <dig> pathways. akt phosphorylation is elevated in the activated oocytes of lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries and lhx8/pten double knockouts, which synergistically affects foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic localization and rps <dig> activation. the foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may not be the first step in initiating oocyte activation, because more than  <dig> % of unactivated primordial follicles  show foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic translocation in the double pten/lhx <dig> conditionally deficient ovaries, and foxo <dig> nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was mostly observed in oocytes greater than  <dig> μm among single lhx <dig> conditional knockouts. moreover, the lhx <dig> conditional knockout phenotype is dominant to pten as pten/lhx <dig> double conditional knockouts cannot rescue lhx <dig> induced oocyte loss, and ovaries are indistinguishable from lhx <dig> single conditional knockout ovaries .

the expression of genes that are part of the pi3k-akt-mtorc <dig> pathways was not significantly affected by conditional inactivation of lhx <dig> in oocytes by both quantitative pcr and rna-seq . these results indicate that lhx <dig> indirectly interacts with the members of the pi3k-akt-mtorc <dig> pathways to affect pfa. genes known to affect folliculogenesis, such as gdf <dig>  bmp <dig>  and amh, were downregulated . the lack of gdf <dig> and bmp <dig> is unlikely to explain the decoupling of oocyte activation and somatic cell differentiation as gdf <dig> and bmp <dig> knockouts form primary follicles  <cit> . it is likely that factors other than gdf <dig> and bmp <dig> are involved in primordial oocyte-soma communication. rna-seq identified a sixfold upregulation of lin28a in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries. real-time pcr confirmed the upregulation of lin28a in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre ovaries, but lin28b was not significantly changed . in addition, lin28b was not modified in lhx8flx/flxlin28aflx/flxgdf9cre ovaries either . lhx <dig> can bind to the conserved lhx <dig> dna binding motif in the lin28a promoter, and lin28a deficiency suppresses primordial oocyte activation observed in lhx <dig> deficient oocytes. moreover, lin28a deficiency reduced the akt activation observed in lhx <dig> deficient oocytes. these experiments show that lhx <dig> indirect regulation of the akt activation is mediated in part via lin28a. interestingly, lin28a overexpression in myoblasts enhanced phosphorylation of akt and mtorc <dig> signaling targets  <cit> . lin28a is preferentially expressed in the gonads and germline  <cit> . in caenorhabditis elegans, loss of lin- <dig> results in precocious vulva differentiation and premature developmental progression  <cit> . in mice, lin28a gain-of-function leads to a delay in mouse puberty, with increased body size  <cit> . the mechanism behind lin28a somatic growth-promoting functions in mammals involves increased glucose utilization in part via an increase in insulin-pi3k-mtor signaling  <cit> . besides, lin28a is also a well-known rna-binding protein that blocks biogenesis of many micrornas . although previous studies have shown that loss of lin28a function in oocytes does not affect fertility or oogenesis  <cit> , our results suggest that lin28a overexpression, under the control of lhx <dig>  regulates pfa.

we examined expression of let- <dig> micrornas in lhx8flx/flxgdf9cre and lhx8flx/flxlin28aflx/flxgdf9cre oocytes. let- <dig> transcript levels were not changed in either mouse model . these results are consistent with a previous report showing that lin28a and lin28b do not regulate let-7a in oocytes  <cit> . given that lin28a deficiency reduced the akt activation observed in lhx <dig> deficient oocytes, we consider that lin28a regulates akt activation through a way independent of let- <dig>  lin28a binds many rna species, and further investigations are needed to identify lin28a’s mechanisms of action in oocytes  <cit> .

unlike pten-mediated pathways, whose actions are stage-specific and confined to pfa  <cit> , lhx <dig> deletion in primary oocytes disrupts follicle growth beyond primary oocytes and results in infertility. the initial rise in primary follicles circa pd <dig> is likely due to the onset of the zp3cre-mediated inactivation of lhx <dig> that blocks the transition from primary to more advanced follicles. at pd <dig> and pd <dig>  oocyte death in primary follicles is evident. interestingly, we did not observe a significant decline in primordial follicles from pd <dig> to pd <dig>  which argues against the notion that secondary and more advanced follicles inhibit pfa.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that lhx <dig> plays a critical role in primordial oocyte activation and somatic differentiation and proliferation. lhx8-regulated pathways are dominant over pten pathways, are upstream of kit, and unlike pten pathways, are required for later stages of oogenesis. multiple pathways, both ubiquitous  and oocyte-specific , play important roles in oocyte activation and survival. these models will allow further molecular dissection of oocyte-specific activation and signaling that allows the somatic component to differentiate from pre-granulosa cells to cuboidal and multi-layered follicles.
