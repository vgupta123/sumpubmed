BACKGROUND
in recent years, the development of a variety of affordable high throughput genome-wide assays enables multiple measurements of genomic markers from different platforms and/or scales for the same subject, e.g., gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphisms , copy number variation, and proteomic data. each of these measurements provides different but complementary information about genome variations. combining multiple types of data not only can contribute to a better understanding of biological mechanism but also can have the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatments of complex diseases. therefore, integrative approaches for large-scale genomic data analysis are in highly demand  <cit> .

a number of approaches have been proposed to analyze multiple genomic data, e.g., partial least squares correlation  and canonical correlation analysis . cca is closely related to plsc  <cit> , which is obtained by maximizing the correlation between the linear combinations of variables from two data sets, e.g., a linear combination of snps and a linear combination of gene expressions. cca can provide a global and thought view of data by compressing variables into  <dig> or  <dig> dimensions which are actually able to contain the dominant characteristics of data, for example, gene expressions involving in the same pathway process have the similar effect from the variations in multiple snps. it may hence provide better understanding of the underlying known or unknown biological systems. for example, the co-expressed and co-regulated genes and their associating snps. different from the regression based integrative methods , cca focus on the canonical correlation framework without more prior knowledge of which type of omic data is explained or regressed by the another one . it is more applicable for exploring the correlated information from the paired omic data sets by cca method. however, the conventional cca model is not effective for the analysis of genomic data with small sample size because of the issue of high dimensionality-the number of biomarkers is always greatly larger than that of samples. an example is the snp array, where millions of snps exist but only a few array samples are available. conventional cca will perform poorly in such a case  <cit> . in addition, this high dimensionality can result in possible multi-collinearity  problem, and thus computational difficulty  <cit> .

to address the above issues, one way is to perform dimension reduction by using principle component analysis  or independent component analysis  followed by the conventional cca. another way is to introduce the sparsity penalty into the conventional cca model, named sparse cca  by incorporating the feature selection into cca to detect the correlation between a small subset of features. this is inspired by recent developments of sparse representation methods, e.g., sparse linear regression , sparse logistic regression  <cit> , and sparse principle component analysis . to list a just few examples, waaijenborg et al. <cit>  introduced the l- <dig> norm and elastic net penalties to the cca model to analyze the correlation between gene expression and dna-markers. parkhomenko et al. <cit>  proposed a scca method with lasso penalty based on svd . le cao et al. <cit>  used the penalized cca with the elastic net to identify sets of co-expressed genes from two different microarray platforms. witten et al. <cit>  developed a penalized matrix decomposition  method and applied it to solve cca with lasso and fuse lasso penalties. generally, all of these scca models have the ability of identifying subsets of features by using sparse penalties such as the l- <dig> norm or elastic net   <cit> ; however, they have not yet accounted for group structures within the data in the analysis, which often exist in genomic data. for example, genes within the same pathway have similar functions and act together in regulating a biological system. these genes can add up to have a larger effect and therefore can be detected as a group .

considering a group of features instead of individual feature has been found to be effective for biomarker identification  <cit> . yuan and lin proposed the group lasso for group variables selection  <cit> . meier et al. <cit>  extended it to the logistic regression. puig et al. <cit>  and simon et al. <cit>  modified the group lasso to solve the non-orthonormal matrices. although group lasso penalty can increase the power for variable selection, it requires a strong group-sparsity  <cit> , and cannot yield sparsity within a group  <cit> . friedman et al. <cit>  proposed a sparse group lasso penalty by combining the l- <dig> norm with group lasso to yield sparsity at both the group and individual feature level. zhou et al. <cit>  applied it to genomic feature identification. recently some work has been reported to incorporate the ‘group effect’ into a conventional cca model. chen et.al studied structure based cca and proposed tree-based and network-based cca  <cit> . chen etal. incorporated the group effect into an association study of nutrient intake with human gut microbiome  <cit> . both papers show an improvement when incorporating the group effect, however, a prior knowledge of group structure is needed and only the group effect of one type of data is discussed. motivated by this, in this paper we develop a more general group sparse cca method. this model has the following advantages: 1) feature selection will be performed at both group and single feature levels. both irrelevant groups of features and individual features in the remaining groups will be removed at the same time, without prior knowledge of group structures; 2) it provides a general framework for canonical correlation analysis. it can be reduced to the cca group model which can account for the group effect of multiple features. it can also revert to the popular cca-l <dig>  model by setting the group penalties to zeros.

in order to solve the model, an effective optimization algorithm, namely block cyclic coordinate descent algorithm, was designed. we built the model based on regularized svd, which is similar to that used in sparse pca  <cit> , pmd   <cit>  and 2-d penalized cca  <cit> . since the objective function used in the model was not convex, we re-formulated the model using the lagrange form and transformed it into a biconvex optimization problem with the method in  <cit> . unlike the existing scca models, the non-differentiability of sparse group lasso penalty used in the model poses a challenge for optimization and the standard coordinate descent algorithm will not work well. to this end, we designed an effective optimization method based on the block cyclic coordinate descent algorithm  <cit> . our proposed group sparse cca model can include both cca-l <dig> and cca-elastic net as special examples and hence the optimization method can be applied to solve these models as well.

the rest of the paper is organized as follows. the model and algorithm for our proposed group sparse cca are described in section method. the performances of our model and other scca models are compared via both simulated and real data in section of results. the advantages and limitations of the proposed model are summarized in conclusion.

materials
gliomas data
human gliomas are a group of brain tumors lacking an optimal treatment. genomic techniques such as snps and gene expression arrays provide complementary information, which can be used together to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. therefore, identifying the relationship between snps and gene expression is significant. the scca can be used for solving this problem by identifying correlations between gene expressions and snps.

real data was downloaded from geo database . it was collected from  <dig> human gliomas containing  <dig> astrocytomas, <dig> oligodendrogliomas and  <dig> glioblastomas  <cit> . they include  <dig> snp measurements  and  <dig> gene expression measurements . snps with >20% missing data were deleted and further missing data were imputed. the gene expression data were normalized. we assigned snps that are within the region 1 kb upstream of the transcription start sites  and to the end of the transcribed to be associated with a gene. by the canonical pathways from the molecular signatures database , we identified the pathway named reactome downstream events in gpcr signaling , containing the most genes . this pathway was analyzed by the proposed scca method. there are  <dig> gene expression measurements and  <dig> snps included in this pathway.

nci <dig> data
two expression datasets obtained on  <dig> cell lines from the national cancer institute  were used; see  <cit>  for more details of data. a total  <dig> cell-lines were assayed for gene expression  and cdna . those  <dig> cell-lines were derived from patients with leukemia , melanomas , cancers of ovarian , breast , prostate , lung , renal , colon  and central nervous system . the gene expression data were obtained using affymetrix hg-u133a chip and cdna data were profiled by spotted cdna microarrays. both data sets were normalized and pre-processed as described below.

in the ross data set,  <dig> spots were detected and those with more than 15% missing values were removed. the remaining missing values were imputed by a k-nearest neighbour approach  <cit> . the missing data was imputed by  <dig> nearest neighborhoods where the similarity between the two points was measured by euclidean distance. the expression of these  <dig> neighborhoods would be weight averaged. the contribution of each neighborhood point was weighted by its similarity to the missing point. a subset of  <dig> spots was further selected by filters used in  <cit> . in the staunton data set,  <dig> probe sets were used to screen each sample and  <dig> probe sets having at least  <dig> average difference units across all cell lines were selected after a series of pre-processing steps described in  <cit> .

to study the group effects of these biomarkers, we need to separate those genetic markers into different groups. we used hierarchical clustering method to cluster gene expression probes and cdna spots based on the absolute values of their pearson correlation coefficients and then grouped them with the threshold  <dig> . in gliomas data set,  <dig> expression probes were grouped into  <dig> groups. snps were grouped by their gene annotations. those snps located in the same gene region will be grouped together, resulting in  <dig> genes. in nci <dig> data, there were  <dig> groups of expression probes and  <dig> groups of cdna spots to be analyzed.

RESULTS
simulation
to investigate whether the group sparse cca can improve the detection power when the group effect exists, we performed four simulated studies. we also used the simulation to compare its performance with the other two popular used scca methods  under several conditions such as different sample size, varying number of correlated variables in the group and different correlations between two data sets.

in each study, two data sets x and y, consisting of p and q variables/features respectively were simulated. data sets x and y were divided into gx and gy groups respectively. for the sake of simplicity, the sparsity of each group was set the same in both x and y. the sample size is n. to correlate the subset of variables in x with the subset of variables in y, we first set a latent variable ϒ = {γi|i =  <dig>  …, n} with distribution n <dig> σγ <dig> to have the similar effect on the correlated variables in two data sets. then x data set was generated by xi∼nθx·γi,σe2Σp×p while y data set by yi∼nθy·γi,σe2Σq×q, where the vector xi ∈ rp, yi ∈ rq are the observations of the i-th sample in x and y; θx=θx <dig> θx <dig> …,θxp, θy=θy <dig> θy <dig> …,θyq, θxj≠ <dig> θyk≠ <dig>  if xj, yk are the correlated variables. otherwise, the variables would be considered as random noise with zero means ; γi is the i-th observation of γ, and σγ <dig> and σe <dig> are the variances of γ and noise variable, and ∑ pxp and ∑ qxq are the variance-covariance matrices of each data set. we simulated the group effect within each dataset by referring to  <cit> . for each data set, we set the auto-regressive correlation between associated variables i and j within the same group to ρ|i − j| and the correlation between different groups from uniform distribution unif. ρ was preferred to be  <dig>  according to  <cit> . the irrelevant variables were drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and covariance from unif.

if one data set  contains categorical variables , we first simulated two set of continuous data x and y. then the variables in y were converted into categorical variables with three levels   <cit> . the minor allele frequency p from the uniform distribution unif was selected randomly for each snp; then based on hardy-weinberg equilibrium, snps were converted according to the homozygous frequency p <dig>  heterozygous frequency 2p, and homozygous frequency  <dig>  for the irrelevant snps, they were sampled from the hapmap ceu panel  at chromosome  <dig> with  <dig> snps by the software hapgen <dig>  <cit> .

we used the total true positive rate , total false positive rate  and total discordance  to evaluate the performance of the modes. ttpr reflects the number of correctly identified correlated variables while td is the number of incorrectly identified variables in both x and y data sets. they are defined as

ttpr=tp_x+tp_ytp_x+fn_x+tp_y+fn_y, tfpr=fp_x+fp_yfp_x+tn_x+fp_y+tn_y

 and td = fp _ x + fn _ x + fp _ y + fn _ y

where tp_x , tp_y, fp_x, fp_y, fn_x, fn_y are true positives, false positives and false negatives in x and y respectively. in each study,  <dig> replications were simulated and 5-fold cross validation was used for parameter selection in each replication.

the receiver operating characteristics  curve was also adopted for the comparison of three methods in identifying the correlated variables. the curve was drawn with tfpr versus ttpr and by varying the tuning parameters. for cca-l <dig> and cca-group methods, there are two parameters searched by a 10 ×  <dig> grid λ takes the values:  <dig> ,  <dig> , …,  <dig> ) with totally  <dig> parameter combinations. for group sparse cca method, there are four parameters searched by a 10 × 10 × 10 ×  <dig> grid of totally  <dig> parameter combinations. since group lasso penalty and l- <dig> norm penalty can both shrink the coefficient vectors, we adopted two steps to draw the roc curve by varying sparsity level: first we obtain the optimal parameters based on the cross validation; then we vary one parameter while fixing the other parameters as the optimal ones to draw the curve. the average values over  <dig> replications were used to plot the roc curves. the roc curves of varying the first parameter were provided in additional file  <dig> 

based on above descriptions, four simulation studies were conducted to investigate the performance of the methods in terms of recovering group structure , the effect of group size , the sample size  and the true correlation value .

simulation  <dig> the recovering accuracy of correlated variables using different cca models
we simulated p =  <dig> variables in data set x and q =  <dig> variables in data set y, which contain  <dig> correlated variables  in each data set with the rest as noise. data set x is divided into gx =  <dig> groups and data set y contains gy =  <dig> groups with the group size  <dig>  the sample size is  <dig>  σγ =  <dig> andσe =  <dig> . we set the vector θx to have  <dig> 1 s,  <dig> -1 s,  <dig>  <dig>  s and the remaining 0 s; vector θγ with length q have  <dig> -1 s,  <dig> – <dig>  s,  <dig> 1 s and the rest are 0 s. each  <dig> non-zero coefficients are assigned randomly into one group along with the remaining  <dig> noise variables as shown in figure  <dig>  the correlated variables in each data set are assigned into four groups and correlated within each group. figure  <dig> shows the results of recovered loading vectors u and v by cca-l <dig>  cca-group and cca-sparse group methods respectively. it can be seen that the cca-sparse group method can better estimate true u and v than the other two methods. the cca-l1selects more noise variables than true u, increasing the false positive in figure  <dig>  also, it misses out some true variables in figure  <dig> when selecting v. the cca-group can better recover all the groups with true variables but also give more false positives in the groups.

simulation  <dig> the effect of the number of correlated variables in the group
variables can be distributed randomly in the data. some of them could be grouped together while others are sparsely located in groups. we run this simulation to study the performance of the methods when the number of correlated variables within the group is changed. we simulated data set x with p =  <dig> variables and data set y with q =  <dig> variables.  <dig> variables in each data set are correlated and the rest are noise variables. data set x contains gx =  <dig> groups and data set y contains gy =  <dig> groups with the same group size of  <dig>  the sample size is  <dig> and the standard deviation σγ =  <dig>  σe =  <dig> . in each data set, the number of groups containing correlated variables is set to be  each time and each group contains  true variables correspondingly. the averaged results over  <dig> replications are shown in figure  <dig>  when correlated variables are distributed in  <dig> groups, both cca-group and cca-group sparse models give much higher ttp while lower td than those of cca-l <dig>  when the number of groups increases , the ttp of cca-group is still quite high but td increases rapidly. the ttp of cca-l <dig> will increase while having td at a low level. the cca-sparse group performs better and is more stable than other methods for having higher ttp and the lowest td. when more correlated variables are assigned to the same group , the cca-sparse group model will obtain higher ttp and lower td. this indicates that, if more true variables are grouped, the power of cca-sparse group method will be increased and the false positives will be decreased .

simulation  <dig> the effect of sample size
in this study, we discuss the effect of sample size on the recovery performance. we simulated data set x with p =  <dig> variables, gx =  <dig> groups and data set y with q =  <dig> variables, gy =  <dig> groups. the group size was fixed to be  <dig>   <dig> variables in each data set are correlated, which are distributed evenly into  <dig> groups. we then increase the sample size in step of  <dig> from n =  <dig> to  <dig> in order to compare the performance  of using different methods. figure  <dig> shows the ttp with respect to different sample size. it can be seen that when the sample size increases, the ttp of all methods increases while the td decreases. the cca-group can achieve a better identification of true correlated variables than those using other two methods, but it also has more td. the ttp of cca-sparse group is less than that of cca-group but more than that of cca-l <dig>  however, the td by cca-sparse group is much less than that of cca-group. especially when the sample size is large , the td of cca-sparse group and cca-l <dig> will stay at the low level. in addition, the ttp and td of cca-group and cca-sparse group tend to have little changes when more than  <dig> samples are used, while those of cca-l <dig> keep changing until almost  <dig> samples are used. the roc curves  at different sample sizes  well demonstrate that the cca-sparse group can obtain a competitive power and sensitivity with much less samples than the other methods.

simulation  <dig> the performance of the methods influenced by noise
finally, we discuss the performance of three models under different noise levels, and study how noise affects the recovery of correlations between two data sets. we simulated data set x with p =  <dig> variables, gx =  <dig> groups, and data set y with q =  <dig> variables, gy =  <dig> groups, having the same group size  <dig>  the correlation of different values is calculated between  <dig> variables in x and  <dig> variables in y. the sample size is  <dig> and σγ =  <dig>  according to the estimation of the highest correlation in  <cit> , there are several factors involved with estimating the highest correlation between the two data sets, i.e.σγ, σe, ∑iαi, ∑iβi, the number of true variables in each data set, and the correlation among true variables within the same group. we fixed other factors but changed the standard deviation σe in the noise model from  <dig>  to  <dig> with interval  <dig>  to manipulate the correlation coefficient between two data sets. the highest correlation estimated  is decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  accordingly from the results in figure  <dig>  we can see that when the true correlation increases due to the decrease of noise, more true variables can be recovered with less total discordance by all three methods. the cca-group model can recover the most correlated variables but also has the highest total discordance. compared to other two models, the cca-l <dig> model has a lower td but also the lowest ttp. the cca-sparse group model can achieve comparable of ttp as that of the cca-group while can have significantly reduced td. especially when σe <  <dig> , the td of cca-sparse group decreases rapidly. the same result can be shown in roc curves; cca-sparse group is expected to give increasingly more power than cca-l <dig> as well as better sensitivity than cca-group when σe is reduced.

to test the computational complexity, we applied the methods on a simulated large data set with  <dig> samples by  <dig> gene expressions and  <dig> snps. in one replicate, each single run time of three methods was on average  <dig>  sec,  <dig>  sec, and  <dig>  sec respectively. the time of running 5-fold cross validation based on the lambdas searching grid was  <dig>  sec,  <dig>  sec and  <dig>  sec respectively. the memory usage was about  <dig>  mega bytes for all of them. the longer time of cca-sparse group method was because of more parameters introduced in the model . the experiments were carried out on a desktop computer with a dual-core  <dig>  ghz x <dig>  <dig> bit processor, 6 gb memory. this shows that three scca methods are generally scalable and computationally affordable for large data sets.

application to real data analysis
comparison of three scca model sets
we applied the cca-l <dig>  cca-group and cca-sparse group to the analysis of these data sets for the purpose of comparisons. the comparisons were based on the correlations derived from the independent data sets, and the feature/variable selection in terms of feature overlapping by the methods, as well as the feature difference across the dimensions. here each dimension indicates each pair of canonical variates. each input data sets was normalized to have zero means in the column and unit variance to correct the scale differences from different datasets.

independent correlation test
to test the performance of exploring the maximum correlation between two data sets using different methods, we divided the subjects into two groups: the training group and independent testing group. the training group was used to obtain the optimal parameters for the models while the testing group was used for testing the correlation between the two independent data sets. in the gliomas data,  <dig> subjects from  <dig> subjects were used for training and the rest  <dig> were used for testing. in nci <dig> data set,  <dig> subjects were divided into  <dig> training subjects and  <dig> testing subjects. to alleviate the effect of subject difference, we permuted the subjects  <dig> times. the box-plot of the results is shown in figure  <dig>  the median correlation ± standard deviation obtained in gliomas data ) and nci <dig> data ) by the cca-sparse group , cca-l <dig> and cca-group are displayed respectively. the median correlations by the cca-sparse group and cca-l <dig> are higher than those of cca-group in both gliomas and nci <dig> data. in addition, the standard deviations of the correlations by the cca-group model in both data sets are larger than those of the other two methods, which tends to select the whole group of features including some unexpected ones as shown in figure  <dig>  in the gliomas data ), the cca-sparse group selects less number of features and obtain a larger correlation with the smallest standard deviation. the cca-group finds the largest amount of features but obtains the smallest estimation of correlations. the cca-l <dig> can get the less number of features with better estimate of the correlation, but is still a little less than that of cca-sparse group. in the nci <dig> data ), the cca-l <dig> identified the similar correlation value to that of cca-sparse group but had a higher standard deviation and selected more features. all of these figures indicate that the detection of correlations and features by the cca-sparse group method has the lowest sensitivity to the samples. compared to other methods, the cca-sparse group can extract less number of features to achieve a higher correlation.

to further discuss the stability of the selected features during the permutation, we counted the number of features selected in  <dig> permutations by three methods and picked the features with the frequency of appearance greater than  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the venn diagrams of the selected features in u by three methods. it can be seen that, in both data sets, the features selected by cca-l <dig> are almost included in those by other two methods, and overlap mostly with cca-sparse group method. in addition, there are overlapped features  selected between the cca-sparse group and cca-group methods. compared to cca-l <dig>  cca-sparse group selects less features in u as shown in ); however, more features are selected with high frequency, which indicates higher stability of the method.

interpretation of the canonical variate pairs
based on the independent test results, we use those optimal parameters as candidates for the cross validation to perform the correlation analysis on the complete subjects  and analyze the biological significance of the canonical variates.

first and other canonical variate pairs
table  <dig> shows three pairs of canonical variates for each data set by three scca methods. in both data sets, the correlations by the cca-group are smaller than those of cca-sparse group and cca-l <dig>  this agrees with the results in the independent analysis. in the gliomas data, the maximum correlation was, surprisingly obtained on the second dimension for all the methods. in the nci <dig> data, all the correlations are very high in three dimensions, especially greater than  <dig>  by the cca-sparse group and cca-l <dig> methods, which is consistent with the results in  <cit> . we can see that except the third canonical variate in nci <dig> data, the cca-sparse group can mostly identify the highest correlation with the least number of features, which confirms the analysis results in figure  <dig>  the maximum correlation is obtained on the first dimension for cca-sparse group and the second pair for cca-group and cca-l <dig> methods. this trend of non-decreasing correlations in both data sets is not expected in the conventional cca model, since it aims to extract the canonical variate with the maximum correlation at each step. this point was also discussed in  <cit>  due to the optimization criterion and regularization term used in scca models. it can be found that the permutation of the correlation is in accord with the permutation of the dimensions.

to test the significance of the correlation estimation, we kept the selected features unchanged while permuting the subjects  <dig> times in one data set to approximate the null distribution of the correlation with these selected features as in  <cit> . the p value was measured by the proportion of the correlations larger than the original correlation. we gave the p value of the correlation estimation using the first pair of canonical variates in table  <dig>  almost all of the methods can derive the correlation based on the dimension with very low p values, which demonstrates the significance of the sparse cca methods and the selected optimal parameters.

comparison of selected features
as described in the algorithm, when multiple pairs of canonical variate exist, we derive the next pair of loading vectors which are assumed to be orthogonal to those previously identified ones. therefore, there is a small degree of overlap of the selected features between two loading vectors , which indicates that those selected features at each loading vector may carry different level of uncorrelated information. this orthogonal property could be kept in the sparse cca methods but is not often the case; see table  <dig>  we calculated three pairs of loading vectors for each method and compared the features, which are overlapping between any two pairs of loading vectors. there are few features overlapped between the cca-sparse group and cca-l <dig> in almost all dimensions. only  <dig> to  <dig> features are overlapping in the gliomas data and  <dig> to  <dig> features are overlapping in nci <dig> data. especially, there are no features overlapping across the three dimensions of u for cca-sparse group in both data sets. however, for cca-group, there are a large number of overlapping features. since the feature selection with cca-group is based on the group level, the overlapping of the individual features cannot be controlled.

discussion
biological interpretation of nci <dig> data analysis
we give some discussions on graphical representations to study the discriminating ability of the selected features. the biological interpretations are provided by pathway analysis. le gao et al. performed the hierarchical clustering analysis of ross and staunton data sets in  <cit> . a better clustering of the cell lines can be obtained based on their tissue of origin with ross data set. the  <dig> cell lines in ross data set were mainly divided into three groups by their correlations: 1) cell lines with epithelia characteristics ; 2) cell lines with mesenchymal characteristics; and 3) me cell lines .

based on these three groups of cell lines, we used graphical representation to evaluate whether the canonical variates and the corresponding identified features can represent different tumor cell lines. we computed three pairs of canonical variate by the cca-sparse group method and drew the scatter plot of the samples using the first v.s. the second canonical variate ) and the first v.s. the third canonical variate ). here each cell line was represented by three canonical variates. each canonical variate was taken as one dimension of the cell line. it can be seen that the genes selected in the first dimension could help discriminate cell lines with epithelia from cells lines with mesenchymal characteristics; the features in the second dimension could discriminate themelanoma cell lines from the other cell lines and the features in the third dimension are opt to separate the co cell lines from the le cell lines. the similar representations can be derived for cca-group and cca-l <dig> method . we found that there was a permutation for the dimension  <dig> and dimension  <dig> in the cca-group method, which is consistent with the permutation of correlation in dimension  <dig> and  <dig> as shown in table  <dig> 

pathway analysis
to further evaluate the biological significance of the features as well as the genes selected by the cca-sparse group method, we used the ingenuity pathway analysis  to analyze those significant canonical pathways for discriminating different cell lines as shown in figure  <dig>  the genes in three dimensions by the cca-sparse group were taken as input in ipa software to identify the corresponding pathways.

in the first dimension, the integrin signaling, paxillin signaling, agrin interactions at neuromuscular junction and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways were identified. those pathways play essential roles in some important biological processes including cellular movement, cell differentiation and cellular interactions with the cell-extracellular matrix  <cit> . some genes, i.e. integrins and actinin and vinculin are over-expressed in re and cns cell lines, compared to le and co cell lines. the identified leukocyte extravasation signaling is known to be responsible for the leukocyte migration and might be related to the metastasis in the leukemia cell lines   <cit> . several genes  in the glioma invasiveness signaling are over-expressed for the invasion and migration of glioma cells in the cns cell lines  <cit> . in the second dimension, some genes including egfr,mapk <dig>  mmp <dig> and cdkn2a from the epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection, p <dig> signaling, gnrh signaling and metabolic pathways are over-expressed in melanoma cells and involve with cellular growth, migration and metastasis  <cit> . in the third dimension, the tight junction signaling pathway  was identified, which is consistent with epithelial characteristics of co cell lines  <cit> . leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway was also identified to separate le cell lines from co cell lines.

although group sparse cca can handle high number of variables with small sample size, the larger sample size can improve the results. from the simulation result, we can see the higher false positive and lower true positive when the sample size is too small.

in simulation, the group effect for relevant variables within the group is simulated with autoregressive correlation by ρ|i − j|. we chose the ρ value as  <dig>  as suggested by  <cit> . the higher ρ value indicates higher correlation between variables correlation. the group effect for relevant variables between two groups is drawn from unif. in group sparse cca model, the between group correlation is expected to be low. if there is a strong correlation between two groups, similar to the lasso, it will result in the multi-collinearity issue. the correlation between two data sets may not be affected but the power of detecting correlated variables will decrease. in this case, we suggest to combine two highly correlated groups into one group or to incorporate the between group correlation information into the model.

in group sparse cca model, the groups are assumed to be non-overlapping. this criterion can be met when grouping gene expressions by the hierarchical model or snps by their gene annotations. however, if we group gene set or snps by their pathway index, the group overlapping may exist. in this case, we can modify group sparse cca by using the algorithm of chen et al.’s or expand the overlapped genes  into both groups as discussed in  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we propose a group sparse cca model to explore the correlation between two different types of genomic data. we solve the model with an efficient algorithm based on regularized svd and block cyclic coordinate decent approach. the general model we propose can include cca-l <dig>  cca-elastic net and cca-group models as special examples. our algorithm for solving cca-l <dig> is very similar to that in  <cit>  and we show that the algorithms for cca-l <dig> and cca-elastic net will converge to the same solution under a particular condition. we compare the performance of group sparse cca method with cca-l <dig> and cca-group methods on simulation data under different conditions such as sample size, group size and the measurement of correlations. undoubtedly, our cca-sparse group method outperforms the existing ones by identifying features with more true positives while controlling the total discordance at a low level. the real data analysis on human gliomas and nci <dig> data sets shows that the cca-sparse group can explore significant correlations with smaller variance and the selected features shows higher stability. the graphical display and pathway analysis of nci <dig> data indicates the selected features contain important information of different tumors. for these reasons, we believe that the cca-sparse group method is an interesting and valuable approach for feature selection and correlation analysis.
