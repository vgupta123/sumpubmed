BACKGROUND
grapevine flavescence dorée phytoplasma  is one of the most severely damaging diseases affecting european vineyards. this quarantine pest continues to have a significant economic impact not only in the two major european wine-producing countries, italy and france, but also in spain, switzerland, portugal, austria, croatia, slovenia, serbia and hungary  <cit> . the cicadellid leafhopper scaphoideus titanus ball is the only known vector that transmits the disease from grapevine to grapevine  <cit> . symptoms appear in early summer and increase in incidence and severity until harvest. these symptoms consist of drying of berry peduncles and consecutive shrivelling or drying of berries, leaf discolouration and downward leaf curling  <cit> . consequently, grapevine vitality and yields are reduced, and the production of wine is irreparably compromised.

phylogenetical analyses indicated that fd can be divided into two taxonomic 16s groups, 16srv-c and 16srv-d  <cit> , and three genetic clusters according to the sequence of the map gene: map-fd <dig> , map-fd <dig>  and map-fd <dig>   <cit> . the three clusters show different geographical distributions. in piedmont, which is one of the most renowned italian wine-making regions, both fd-c and fd-d isolates have been detected  <cit> . in this region, the local administration spent nearly €  <dig>  million per year from  <dig> to  <dig> in disease control programs. additionally, in  <dig> the italian government and the european union spent €  <dig> million to refund growers for yield losses and replanting  <cit> . better knowledge of the molecular interaction between the pathogen and its hosts is thus essential to develop new and sustainable control strategies to reduce the non-target impacts of the compulsory insecticide treatments against the vector.

new high-throughput “omics” technologies, such as whole transcriptome sequencing  and high-resolution mass spectrometry, allow simultaneous examination of thousands of genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, opening new possibilities towards marker discovery and genome-wide identification of signalling molecules, protein functions and interactions. such technologies were recently applied also to the study of plant-phytoplasma interactions, but in most of these cases only the plant responses to the phytoplasma infection have been investigated, leaving the phytoplasma perspective almost unexplored . only two reports took advantage of the new high-throughput technologies to describe the transcriptional and proteome landscape of phytoplasmas: ji and colleagues provided the first valuable dataset of mulberry dwarf phytoplasma proteins by a shotgun proteomics approach  <cit>  and, more recently, siewert and colleagues  <cit>  combined rna-seq and shotgun proteomics to provide insights into the expressed genes of ‘candidatus phytoplasma mali’ infecting graft-inoculated nicotiana occidentalis leaves. microarrays were instead used for the first global gene expression study on phytoplasmas, which evaluated the changes in gene expression during ‘candidatus phytoplasma asteris’ “host-switching” between plant to insect hosts  <cit> .

in the present study, rna-seq provided the first comprehensive transcriptomics landscape of fd phytoplasma infecting field-grown cv. barbera grapevines. an annotated draft genome of the fd <dig> isolate, covering 85% of the  <dig> kbp chromosome, has been recently produced using a combination of  <dig> pyrosequencing and illumina/solexa  <cit> . in the absence of a complete fd genome sequence, different approaches to separate fd-mapping reads from the eukaryotic ones followed by assemblies and recursive merging of sequence datasets were used to reconstruct the fd transcripts. in this way, previously unannotated regions, polycistronic transcripts, 5′/3′ utr regions and non-coding rnas  have been identified. moreover, genes potentially involved in plant-phytoplasma interactions were selected to validate the rna-seq results by qrt-pcr on field-grown grapevines infected by either 16srv-c or -d isolates.

RESULTS
phytoplasma detection, strain characterization and quantification
diagnostic assays confirmed the presence of fd and the absence of stolbur ‘bois noir’  phytoplasma in all three grapevine leaf samples used in this study . in addition, qrt-pcr assays on the most common viruses reported in piedmont vineyards revealed the presence of grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus in all samples and grapevine fleck virus in sample  <dig> and b <dig> 

on the basis of the taqi-rflp profiles of the ribosomal 16s gene, samples  <dig> and b <dig> were identified as 16srv-c isolates and sample b <dig> as a 16srv-d isolate . in the three samples, the phytoplasma titer expressed as number of fd cells/500 mg of plant tissue ranged from  <dig> e+ <dig> to  <dig> e+ <dig> 

relative quantification of grapevine and phytoplasma mrnas
the ratio between the grapevine and the phytoplasma transcripts was evaluated by qrt-pcr, considering the expression of two single-copy genes: fd secy and grapevine ubiquitin. the transcriptional levels of these two genes were estimated to be  <dig> and  <dig> copy number, respectively, so fd transcripts represented nearly  <dig> % of the total grapevine messengers.

data coverage
total rna extracted from sample  <dig> was split in two parts, named sample  <dig> and sample 120e.

the two samples were analysed separately as technical replicates in independent sequencing runs, generating two sets of total fd transcriptome profiles.

a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end  reads  with an average insert size of 153 bp ± 39 bp was generated from libraries  <dig> and 120e, respectively.

the quality control and trimming resulted in two filtered sets  assembled with three different strategies. the effectiveness of each assembly approach was evaluated and compared to the others in order to choose the best performer and obtain the best description of the fd transcriptome .

reads assembly
as a first assembly approach, reads from libraries  <dig> and 120e were first mapped to the fd <dig> draft genome  and then assembled. the number of pe reads mapping in the antisense orientation to the fd <dig> predicted coding sequences  was below the theoretical maximum number of spurious cdnas generated during the second-strand synthesis of the reverse transcription , so they were not further analyzed.table  <dig>

in each library nearly  <dig> % of the total reads were mapped, confirming the ratio obtained by qrt-pcr. the two separate assemblies obtained from the libraries  were compared to evaluate the technical reproducibility. some sequences were unique to each dataset, i.e. they did not find any significant hits in others, whereas many other sequences found at least one significant hit with 100% identity across the alignment, but with a different length. these results suggested the importance of dealing with at least two technical replicates when studying the genome-wide transcriptome profile of an organism whose sequences represent a very small fraction of the total rna-seq library. a merged dataset  was obtained from the assembly of these two initial datasets.

the second assembly approach consisted in merging reads from the two libraries, mapping them to the fd <dig> genome and then assembling them altogether. the resulting dataset  was compared to dataset  <dig> to determine the best assembly strategy. sequences from dataset  <dig> included all the sequences of dataset  <dig> and were generally longer than the corresponding sequences of dataset  <dig>  therefore, the second assembly approach proved to be far more efficient than the first one. a new merged dataset  was obtained from the assembly of dataset  <dig> and  <dig> 

as a final approach, reads from the two merged libraries were first mapped to the v. vinifera genome. the vitis-unmapped reads, which represented nearly  <dig> % of each library, were then de novo assembled. the resulting sequences with significant similarities to known mollicutes genes  were compared to dataset  <dig>  no unique sequences were identified in dataset  <dig>  but still there were differences in length between some matching sequences from the two datasets. the third assembly approach was found to be less efficient than the second one, both in terms of number and in terms of the average length of the assembled sequences. however, it was adopted in combination with the second approach to obtain a more accurate description of the fd transcriptome.

a final comprehensive fd transcriptome dataset of  <dig> sequences with an average length of 294 bp was created by assembling dataset  <dig> and  <dig> and used for further analyses.

comparison of rna-seq transcripts to fd <dig> annotated genes
 <dig> out of  <dig> rna-seq sequences corresponded to  <dig> fd <dig> annotated genes  . of the remaining  <dig> sequences,  <dig> were present in the fd <dig> genome but the matching regions were not yet annotated, and three did not find any match to the fd <dig> genome but showed significant similarities to poinsettia branch-inducing phytoplasma sequences . pcr analyses with specific primers demonstrated that these three sequences truly belonged to the phytoplasma genome , so they were probably localized in the gaps of the fd <dig> draft genome.



the  <dig> unannotated transcripts  were further analyzed to determine whether they showed significant similarities to known mollicutes protein-coding sequences or previously characterized ncrnas. after querying the ncbi “nr” and the rfam databases, four of them showed significant similarities to three phytoplasma hypothetical proteins and a translation initiation factor if- <dig>  in addition, contig <dig> and contig <dig> showed significant similarities  to ncrnas, namely the catalytically active rna of a group ii intron and the rna component of a bacterial ribonuclease  p class b, respectively. the remaining four unannotated transcripts showed putative orfs spanning the whole length or a part of the nucleotide sequence, but the corresponding predicted proteins did not have any significant similarity to other bacterial sequences.

rna-seq data also provided the opportunity to extend the length of some transcripts compared to the automatic computer annotation of fd <dig> genes:  <dig> sequences were extended by at least  <dig> nucleotide upstream of the predicted translation start  and  <dig> sequences were extended downstream of the predicted stop codon in  <dig> sequences  . the gene coding for the 30s ribosomal subunit protein s <dig> rpsh was extended in both directions.

transcripts that i) mapped to igrs between two non-overlapping consecutive cds on the same strand and ii) partially overlapped the two genes on the same strand were considered as parts of polycistronic transcripts . according to our data, there were at least  <dig> polycistronic transcripts in fd transcriptome, most of them involving ribosomal proteins. excluding operons that were made up only of ribosomal transcripts, most polycistronic transcripts contained two or three genes .table  <dig> 
polycistronic transcripts as identified by the rna-seq assembly


genes are reported in order, starting from the 5′ of the polycistronic transcript.



as sample  <dig> showed a 16srv-c restriction profile whereas fd <dig> is a 16srv-d isolate  <cit> , polymorphisms identified at the nucleotide level in the comparison between rna-seq data and the fd <dig> genome could be exploited for isolate genotyping .

phytoplasma in silicogene expression
the expression levels of a dataset that included the fd <dig> annotated genes extended by the newly identified 5′ utrs and 3′ utrs and the newly identified transcripts, both coding and non-coding, are shown in additional file  <dig>  the most expressed transcript, named contig <dig>  corresponded to the catalytic rna component of a group ii intron, which was present in the fd <dig> genome in at least two slightly divergent copies. it is important to underline that one of these two copies was artificially truncated due to its position at the end of a genomic contig. even if divided by two, the transcriptional level of this catalytic intron remained the highest in both rna-seq libraries. interestingly, a blastx analysis of contig <dig> revealed the presence, at the 3′ end of the sequence, of the first  <dig> amino acids of a putative transposase tra <dig> for insertion sequence element is <dig> . a further analysis of the complete copy corresponding to contig <dig> revealed that it did not contain any internal protein-encoding open reading frames, so it supposedly belonged to the category of the group ii “orf-less” introns. no sequences with significant similarity to ltra, an intron ii reverse transcriptase already annotated in other phytoplasmas genomes, were found either in the rna-seq data or in other regions of the fd <dig> genome. additionally, the tra <dig> fragment identified in contig <dig> was truncated not only in the transcript but also in the corresponding genome region.

the first  <dig> most expressed transcripts included also the immunodominant protein imp, the variable membrane protein vmpa, the ribozyme component of a bacterial rnase p class b, six hypothetical proteins, the groel chaperonin and nine proteins involved in the translation process .table  <dig>

expressed transcripts were classified by comparing sequences against the manually curated kegg genes database . excluding the generic functional category named “metabolic pathways”, the most represented categories during vitis infection were those related to translation and protein metabolism , dna metabolism  and carbon metabolism  . in particular, all the enzymes of the glycolysis pathway were transcribed. transport, protein export and secretion categories were also well represented with a total of  <dig> transcripts. unfortunately, nearly 30% of the total assembled transcripts were not functionally classified.figure  <dig>

where possible, protein-coding transcripts were associated to go terms by blast2go . in order to identify whether any go term was over-/under-represented in the list of the  <dig> most expressed transcripts, an enrichment analysis with two-tailed fisher’s exact test  was performed against all the expressed genes. the over-represented go terms were related to translation and protein metabolism , whereas the only under-represented go term was “catalytic activity” .figure  <dig>

validation of rna-seq expression values by qrt-pcr
target genes for qrt-pcr assays were selected taking into account three criteria: 1) a wide range of in silico expression levels, from the highest  to the lowest , 2) the possible involvement in the host-phytoplasma interactions and 3) the annotation as “hypothetical proteins” of unknown function. fifteen target genes were selected: contig <dig> as the most expressed transcript, two known surface-exposed proteins  , five hypothetical proteins , a protein known to regulate the excretion of virulence factors in other bacteria   <cit> , a protein involved in the secretion pathway , two proteolytic enzymes potentially contributing to virulence , a protein involved in the defence mechanisms against oxidative stress , the rna polymerase sigma factor rpod and an abc transporter  .table  <dig>

selected genes are listed according to the ids of the fd <dig> annotated genes , with the only exception of contig <dig>  which was obtained in this study. the abbreviation used in this work, a brief gene description, the mean of reads per kilobase of transcript  and the mean of the expression indices  are reported.



the existence of transcripts corresponding to contig <dig> and to the hypothetical proteins was first confirmed by rt-pcr on the same rna used for the rna-seq library construction . expression of the selected fd genes was examined in three fd-infected grapevine samples: sample  <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  to estimate the expression level of the selected fd transcripts, the mrna absolute quantity was compared to the phytoplasma titer measured in the corresponding sample. the primers list, the corresponding amplification conditions and efficiencies, melting peak temperatures and correlation coefficients of qrt-pcr reactions were reported in additional file  <dig> 

for each gene, the average expression index  in the three grapevine samples was calculated . the reliability and reproducibility of the expression values of the selected transcripts were confirmed by the squared correlation coefficient  calculated between the qrt-pcr and the rpk values .figure  <dig> 
correlation between rna-seq and qrt-pcr expression data. plot of the transcriptional levels of the  <dig> selected genes expressed as rpk values  and expression index values . r <dig> =  <dig>  .



according to the welch-one way test, the mean of expression levels was significantly different among target transcripts . contig <dig> was the most abundant transcript in all three grapevine samples, irrespective of their restriction profiles, with an average ei significantly higher than all the other genes.

discussion
application of deep sequencing technologies to specifically study the transcriptome of intracellular obligate endosymbiont bacteria has been attempted in very few cases, because the selection of prokaryotic transcripts in a multitude of eukaryotic rnas makes the accurate representation of the bacterial transcriptome particularly challenging. to our knowledge, the only overall gene expression studies conducted so far on phytoplasmas was that of siewert and colleagues  <cit>  on ‘ca. p. mali’. other whole-transcriptome analyses of obligate intracellular bacteria were, for instance, concerned with a. phagocytophilum
 <cit> , lawsonia intracellularis
 <cit>  and wolbachia in symbiosis with onchocerca volvulus
 <cit> . in almost all of these studies, including the one on ‘ca. p. mali’ , hosts were artificially infected and kept in laboratory conditions. the study on wolbachia was so far the only one in which an obligate intracellular bacterium was analyzed under natural conditions, i.e. in nematodes living in cattle raised in field. in all cases, a bacterium-enrichment procedure was undertaken by selecting particular cell types/tissues and/or by adopting specific experimental procedures . in our work, samples were collected in field from a piedmontese vineyard in late july and the pathogen-enrichment process consisted of coupling the rna extraction from leaf midribs to eukaryotic rrna depletion.

in ‘ca. p. mali’ , the rna-seq approach resulted in  <dig> mapped reads, corresponding to  <dig> expressed genes  <cit> . in our study, deep sequencing of a fd-infected grapevine sample followed by three assembly approaches allowed us to obtain an average of  <dig> fd-mapped reads per library, which represented a better coverage of the reference transcriptome. as in many other genomic-scale transcriptomics surveys, also in this study rna-seq proved to be an extremely powerful technique for a) the detection and quantification of previously unannotated transcripts, b) the discovery of the polycistronic organization of some transcripts and c) the addition of 5′/3′ utrs to protein-coding genes. this kind of data becomes extremely precious especially when dealing with obligate intracellular bacteria, which can neither be grown under laboratory conditions nor genetically manipulated.

in our work, we assembled  <dig> sequences corresponding to  <dig> protein-coding genes  and we found that  <dig> fd <dig> genes showed at least one mapped read in both libraries. mastronunzio and colleagues identified  <dig> a. phagocytophilum expressed genes  <cit> , whereas vannucci and colleagues reported that  <dig> protein-coding genes of l. intracellularis showed at least one mapped read  <cit> . our results are close to the number of expressed transcripts reported for other obligate intracellular bacteria, despite the fact that the number of reads mapping to those genomes was higher, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of reads.

analyzing global transcriptional levels, genes related to ribosomal structure and biogenesis, transcription and protein biosynthesis were the most expressed in fd, as well as in l. intracellularis
 <cit> . this result, along with the absence of highly expressed genes related to the dna replication machinery or cell cycle, suggests that, in late july, when the fd titer has been demonstrated to be the highest  <cit> , phytoplasma cells had already undergone extensive cycles of replication and growth. therefore, most of the energy could be rerouted to protein synthesis. interestingly, the chaperone groel was included in the list of the fd most expressed genes. its remarkable ability to rescue non-productive protein conformations is particularly crucial in obligate endosymbiotic bacteria, in which the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations as a result of their distinctive lifestyle often affects the functional conformation of proteins  <cit> .

excluding the transcription/translation-related proteins, almost all the other proteins in the list of fd top  <dig> highly expressed genes are known or predicted membrane proteins. imp and vmp proteins are well known cell-surface proteins and several studies suggested they might have a prominent role in the host–phytoplasma interaction . in addition, two hypothetical proteins  were predicted to have one transmembrane region and a cleavage site, so they are likely to remain attached to the fd membrane after secretion. the nucleotide polymorphisms we observed in some membrane protein-coding genes between the fd <dig> genome and our rna-seq data are consistent with the necessary adaptations of the bacterium to its complex and changing relationship with the host. these differences could be exploited for studying the fd genetic diversity within different strains.

besides genes related to protein synthesis, the functional classification highlighted a high percentage of unclassified genes. this was probably due to a) the lack of a good functional annotation for some known phytoplasma proteins, such as spovg, imp, vmpa, vmpb, etc.…, and b) the presence of many hypothetical proteins whose functions are still unknown and thus not yet included in databases.

it is noteworthy that the abundance of hypothetical proteins  among the fd most expressed genes is in accordance to the results obtained in l. intracellularis
 <cit>  and wolbachia
 <cit> , in which seven and four out of the  <dig> most expressed genes encoded hypothetical proteins, respectively. even in ‘ca. p. mali’ the highest number of rna-seq reads was assigned to a conserved hypothetical integral membrane protein  <cit> . therefore, such hypothetical proteins of unknown function should be the main targets for future analyses to elucidate their potential role in host-bacterial interactions.

other known potential phytoplasma effectors, such as sap-like proteins , hflb proteases and aaa+ atpases  <cit> , superoxide dismutases  <cit> , proteins of the sec-dependent secretion pathway  <cit> , were expressed, but not listed among the most expressed genes in fd.

the most striking results were the high expression levels of two ribozymes that were not previously annotated in the fd <dig> genome: the rna component of a bacterial rnase p class b and the catalytic rna of a group ii intron. bacterial rnases p are made up of two components: a catalytic rna and a polypeptide chain. together they function as an endoribonuclease that removes the precursor sequence from the 5′ end of a primary trna transcript to generate mature trnas  <cit> . the high level of transcription of the rna component of this ribonucleoprotein complex was consistent with the high expression of genes related to translation, as trna maturation is an essential process for protein biosynthesis.

widespread in prokaryotes and in organelles of fungi, plants and lower eukaryotes, group ii introns are genetic retroelement capable of self-splicing and inserting into dna sites  <cit> . they typically consist of a ribozyme, which catalyzes splicing events, and a protein, which takes part both in splicing and insertion events. in prokaryotes, the protein component, which shows endonuclease, reverse transcriptase and maturase domains, is encoded by the intron itself and is essential for both retrohoming and retrotransposition  <cit> . in the fd <dig> genome two almost identical copies of this group ii intron were identified so far. one of these was artificially truncated at the 3′ due to its position at the end of a genomic contig, so only the other copy was analyzed in more detail. the complete genomic copy of this group ii intron was very similar  to the onion yellows phytoplasma intron named oypi <dig>   <cit> , but, unlike oypi <dig>  it seemed to be an orf-less intron, as neither a reverse transcriptase nor any other protein-coding gene was detected within the intron sequence. as already hypothesized for onion yellows phytoplasma orf-less oypi <dig>   <cit> , isolate fd <dig> could also harbor in the gaps of its unfinished genome at least one full-length group ii intron that may act in trans on the other orf-less group ii intron. it has, in fact, been shown that group ii introns that became fragmented by genome rearrangements in eukaryotic organelles have the capacity to ligate independently transcribed coding sequences, splice accurately in vivo and finally produce a functional mrna  <cit> . the presence of a tra <dig> remnant at the 3′ of contig <dig> suggested that the absence of the retrotranscriptase in this copy could indeed be associated with some genome rearrangements. finally, we cannot exclude that the missing part of the other copy of group ii intron could encode itself a functional reverse transcriptase.

the high transcriptional levels of contig <dig> and the presence in the fd <dig> genome of other proteins usually associated with group ii intron mobility, such as a complete reca and a dead-box protein  <cit> , may indicate that the retroelement can be fully functional.

to our knowledge, this is the first report of the expression of a phytoplasma group ii intron during plant infection. the high transcriptional levels of this gene were confirmed by qrt-pcr on the same sample used for the rna-seq library construction  and on other two grapevine samples , even though they belonged to two different 16s restriction profiles. hypothesizing that contig <dig> could really be part of a functional retroelement, it may contribute to the genomic plasticity that is necessary for the phytoplasma to increase its fitness and, ultimately, adapt to its host. mobile elements, in general, are known to play key roles during the emergence of host-adaptive strategies in bacteria  <cit>  and group ii introns, in particular, have been demonstrated to be responsible of some recent genomic rearrangements in the bacterial endosymbiont wolbachia
 <cit> 
.

fourteen additional genes, including highly expressed hypothetical proteins and genes with possible involvements in the host-bacterium interactions, were examined by qrt-pcr. the positive correlation on a linear regression model between qrt-pcr and rpk values and the high r-squared value demonstrated that rna-seq data properly estimated the expression levels of the selected genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the rna-seq technology was successfully applied for the first time to analyse the fd global transcriptome profile during grapevine infection. our results provided new insights into the fd gene structure, transcriptional organization and expression levels with an unprecedented resolution for phytoplasmas. the low number of fd-mapped reads has not prevented us from improving the genome annotation or from providing a reliable view of the fd transcriptome, but it was a limitation when exploring the antisense transcription. the strand-specific rna-seq could have shed some light on the fd antisense transcriptional activity, which is totally unexplored. however, because the number of reads mapping to fd annotated cdss in the antisense orientation was lower than the possible error threshold of the technique, any consideration on this subject would have been merely speculative. a further enrichment for phytoplasma sequences would be necessary not only for this purpose, but also when comparing variable conditions, e.g. the phytoplasma transcriptome in response to the host plant and to the insect vector. a higher number of phytoplasma-mapped reads could, in fact, increase the probability of finding statistically significant differences in the expression profiles. as shown in this work, the use of at least two technical replicates per sample is also essential to provide a broader and more reliable picture of the transcriptional landscape, especially when the genome coverage is low.
