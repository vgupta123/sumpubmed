BACKGROUND
plants sense and respond to environmental variations in temperature, nutrient availability, water level, and light conditions. the homeodomain leucine zipper  transcription factors play a significant role in regulating plant growth adaptation responses by integrating developmental and environmental signals. homeodomain leucine zipper  transcription factors have been found exclusively in the plant kingdom  <cit> , the only exception being the recent identification in the charophycean algae  <cit> . the characteristic feature of the hd-zip gene family is the association of homeodomain  and the leucine zipper  motif in a single protein. in other kingdoms, they are present as domains of distinct proteins. the homeodomain is a ~ <dig> amino acid dna binding domain composed of a helix-turn-helix structure that folds into three characteristic alpha-helices, capable of interacting specifically with dna  <cit> . the lz motif is a dimerization motif and is located immediately after the hd. the lz motif allows the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers that are required for binding to dna. the hd-zip transcription factors can be subdivided into four subfamilies: hd-zip i to iv, based on distinct sequence features , and distinct functions of proteins from each of the subfamilies .

the hd-zip superfamily has been analyzed in several species including arabidopsis   <cit> , rice   <cit> , maize   <cit> , poplar   <cit> , and the hd-zip i and iv genes in cucumber   <cit> . however, functional characterization studies have been limited to the model plant arabidopsis, while a few selected genes have been investigated in other species  <cit> . a subset of the hd-zip genes have recently been described in soybean   <cit> . hd-zip genes are involved in several abiotic stress responses, meristem regulation, photomorphogenesis, and root development  <cit> . the hd-zip i genes have been investigated for their roles in water deficit and salt stress responses. the hd-zip i arabidopsis genes athb <dig> and athb <dig>  and their orthologs in other species, including hahb <dig> from sunflower , nahd <dig> in nicotiana attenuatta, and oshox <dig> in rice , have increased expression under water-stress conditions . athb <dig> and athb <dig> act as negative regulators of growth and development by reducing plant growth under water-deficit conditions  <cit> . hahb <dig> delays the onset of senescence when expressed in arabidopsis
 <cit> . the arabidopsis hd-zip i genes athb <dig> and athb <dig>  and the homologs in craterostigma plantagineum cphb <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and cphb <dig>  are involved in water deficit stress  <cit> . athb <dig> acts as a positive regulator of aba responsiveness at the seedling stage, with elevated levels of athb <dig> resulting in higher aba responsiveness. on the contrary, aba reduces the wild-type expression of athb <dig>  indicating athb <dig> is part of a negative feedback loop regulating aba sensitivity in the germinating seedlings  <cit> . this implies athb <dig> mediates an initial response of the seedling to an aba signal imposed  - but reduces the response to extended water stress. the arabidopsis gene athb <dig> has increased expression under water deficit stress  <cit> . arabidopsis plants overexpressing athb <dig> display lowered stomatal closure and reduced inhibition of germination by aba  <cit>  - the characteristics of the aba-insensitive mutant abi <dig> and abi2
 <cit> . deng et al.  <cit>  suggested that athb <dig> acts as a negative regulator of aba response under water deficit stress.

a recent study in maize found all  <dig> hd-zip i genes differentially expressed  under drought stress  <cit> . the arabidopsis genes athb <dig>  athb <dig> and athb <dig> and the m. truncatula gene mthb <dig> are induced by salt stress  <cit> . the over-expression of mthb <dig> reduces lateral root emergence. ariel et al.  <cit>  proposed reduced lateral root growth as a mechanism to reduce the exposure of the roots to high saline soil. the arabidopsis gene hat <dig>  the rice genes oshox <dig> and oshox <dig>  and the c. plantagineum genes cphb <dig> and cphb <dig>  all in hd-zip ii, are induced by water stress  <cit> . thus, it is evident that members of the hd-zip i and ii are enriched for genes that are involved in water deficit and salt stress. the emphasis in the literature has focused on hd-zip i proteins for their role in abiotic stress, while systematic characterization of genes from the other subfamilies has been lacking. a recent study in rice shows the importance of investigating genes from other subfamilies. yu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the overexpression of a hd-zip iv gene  confers drought tolerance, and increases yield under both normal and drought conditions. with the utilization of high throughput sequencing techniques such as rna-seq, it is possible to investigate the expression of hd-zip genes belonging to all subfamilies in the same experiment, and identify potential candidates for functional characterization studies.

the identification and classification of hd-zip genes in prior studies has been based on homology searches, well-conserved domains and motifs in each of the subfamilies, and on conserved gene structures among subfamily members . the availability of whole genome sequence information for increasing numbers of angiosperm species has enabled utilization of evolutionary relationships among the species to help characterize hd-zip genes. evolutionary relationships among species in a gene family analysis can be combined with whole genome duplication  histories. the eudicots arabidopsis, grape, soybean and m. truncatula share a common “gamma” genome triplication event that occurred around  <dig> million years ago , early in the eudicot evolution  <cit> . the arabidopsis lineage shows a signal for two additional rounds of wgd events within the last  <dig> million years  <cit> . soybean and medicago share a common legume-specific wgd event approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> , and soybean has undergone an additional glycine-specific genome duplication event around  <dig> mya  <cit> . rice shows evidence of two rounds of wgd events  <cit> . the grape genome has undergone a genome triplication event, but lacks a recent wgd event  <cit> . conceptually, a single-copy gene in the ancestor of angiosperm plants and retained after every wgd event would give rise to the following numbers of homologous genes:  <dig> in grape,  <dig> in medicago,  <dig> in rice, and  <dig> each in soybean and arabidopsis. there is also evidence for two even older wgds: one at around  <dig> mya, prior to the separation of angiosperms and gymnosperms and referred to as the “ancestral seed plant wgd”; and another at around  <dig> mya, predating the origin of angiosperms and termed the “ancestral angiosperm wgd”  <cit> . per this model of wgds, an angiosperm gene family is typically comprised of four old angiosperm clades, assuming a starting point of one gene copy in the ancestor of seed plants. we examine the hd-zip family in the context of this hypothesized history of wgds, and provide insights into evolutionary history of each of the subfamilies relative to these wgd events.

in this study, we have 1) identified all putative hd-zip genes in the soybean genome and placed them into their respective subfamilies; 2) provided phylogenetic relationships among hd-zip proteins from eight species that include six eudicots: poplar, cucumber, arabidopsis, grape, soybean and m. truncatula, and two moncots: rice and maize; 3) characterized the structures of all hd-zip genes; 4) described the genomic organization, tracing the expansion of the gene family through wgd events; 5) presented gene expression data for all hd-zip genes in  <dig> conditions including at least  <dig> different tissues of soybean; 6) provided rna-seq based gene expression profiles of all soybean genes including hd-zip genes, in the roots under normal conditions and dehydration and salt stress after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr treatments; and 7) identified genes that may participate in hd-zip gene pathways by screening hd-zip promoters for conserved motif of transcription factor binding sites .

methods
homology searches, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic analysis
the sequences of  <dig> hd-zip  proteins of a. thaliana  described in ariel et al.  <cit> , were obtained from tair  <cit> . the proteomes of four other sequenced angiosperms g. max , m. truncatula , o. sativa  and v. vinifera  were obtained from the respective repositories for these genomes and blast databases were built for each of them on our local server. a blastp v <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  search with a threshold of 1e- <dig> was used for initial identification of the homologous arabidopsis hd-zip genes in each of the genomes described above. the multiple sequence alignment of the homologous sequences from the five species was performed using muscle v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the alignment was manually inspected and trimmed using seaview v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and bbedit v <dig> . <dig> respectively. a preliminary phylogenetic tree  encompassing four hd-zip subfamilies was built using clustal v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and the tree was visually examined using figtree v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

the probable hd-zip genes belonging to each of the four subfamilies were identified based on the clustering of sequences with known hd-zip genes from arabidopsis in the preliminary phylogenetic tree. the outlier sequences that did not cluster with any arabidopsis genes were temporarily excluded. the probable hd-zip genes were then aligned using muscle to build a profile hidden markov model  separately for each subfamily using the hmmbuild program, implemented in the package hmmer v <dig> b <dig>  <cit> . the probable hd-zip sequences were re-aligned to the profile hmm using hmmalign, available in the tool hmmer, and were viewed in seaview. sequence logos were generated for each subfamily using the web tool weblogo  <cit>  to identify conserved regions in the alignments . the hmm alignments were trimmed to retain the conserved regions  using bbedit. the trimmed alignments were used to build the phylogenetic trees for each subfamily using the maximum likelihood method implemented in phyml v <dig>   <cit>  available at iplant collaborative  <cit>  using default settings. the approximate likelihood ratio test  branch support values  <cit>  are displayed on the branches in percentages. the phylogenetic tree for each subfamily was displayed using figtree. the rooting was inferred from ariel et al.  <cit> , angiosperm clade composition, and outgroup sequences from other subfamilies .

the outlier sequences excluded based on the preliminary phylogenetic tree were used in a search against hmm of each subfamily using the hmmpfam available in the tool hmmer v <dig> . <dig> and the membership of sequences in each subfamily was investigated. the process of generating a phylogenetic tree followed by excluding outlier sequences, re-alignments, building hmms, re-aligning using hmm, and rebuilding the trees, was iterated several times for each subfamily. a phylogenetic tree with appropriate tree topology based on evolutionary relationship among the five species was then generated for each subfamily.

lastly, we added hd-zip i to iv sequences from maize and poplar, and hd-zip i and iv sequences from cucumber that have recently been reported  to the final phylogenetic trees. this will allow the investigation of orthologous sequences from eight species that includes hd-zip genes identified in all angiosperm species to date.

validation, structural characterization, and duplication history of hd-zip genes
the hd-zip subfamilies have remarkably well-conserved domains, motifs, and gene structures  <cit>  that can be utilized to validate genes identified using phylogenetic analysis. all sequences identified as hd-zip genes as well as outlier sequences  were used as queries in a batch search  <cit>  against pfam  <dig> , with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig> to identify the conserved domains. the conserved motifs were investigated by examining the sequence logos that were generated using hmm sequence alignments of each subfamily. the gene structure was studied using the exon-intron organization in the pre-mrna. the gene structures were rendered using the g. max cv. williams  <dig> gene models  that were downloaded from phytozome  <cit>  and using a modified version of the bio-graphics  <dig>  feature_draw.pl script  <cit> . the genomic locations were obtained from the gff file of g. max assembly v <dig> , jgi glyma <dig>  annotation, and were displayed using chromosome visualization tool   <cit> . the homoeologous hd-zip gene pairs that are a result of the early-legume wgd event , and the glycine-specific duplication event , were inferred from the phylogeny, as well as from the syntenic paralog pair information available for all soybean genes from the joint genome institute  at phytozome  <cit> . paralogous genes resulting from tandem duplication events were identified based on their proximity on the same chromosome  <cit>  and pairing in the same clade in the phylogenetic tree.

expression profiles of hd-zip genes in  <dig> conditions  of soybean
an rna-seq atlas of g. max describing expression of genes in  <dig> conditions including at least  <dig> different tissues of soybean was reported by severin et al.  <cit>  and libault et al.  <cit> . the reads/kb/million  normalized data for  <dig> tissues investigated by severin et al. are available for download and interactive analysis at soybase  <cit> , and expression data for three additional tissues, and tissues infected with the bacterium bradyrhizobium japonicum are available at soykb  <cit> . a gene was considered expressed if the rpkm value was greater than or equal to two in an expression atlas . the rpkm normalized read count data of expressed genes was log2-transformed and displayed in the form of heatmaps for each subfamily. the heatmap was generated in r  <cit>  using the heatmap. <dig> function available in the gplots cran library. genes in the heatmaps were ordered for consistency with the phylogeny.

plant material and stress experiment
the seeds of g. max cv. williams  <dig> were germinated on moist germination paper and were allowed to grow until the v <dig> stage  in a growth chamber maintained at 77 f and 60% humidity throughout the experiment. the temperature and humidity were continuously monitored and maintained in the growth chamber. the salt treatment was applied by transferring the seedlings into 100 mm nacl solution. for the dehydration treatment, plants were removed from the germination paper and left in air under water-limiting conditions to impose dehydration stress. root tissue was harvested after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr of stress treatments. five plants per time point were maintained for each of the stress treatments. in order to verify the gradual imposition of salt stress treatment, electrical conductivity was measured in two fragments of germination paper, after harvesting root tissue from plants exposed to salt stress at each of the time points . total rna was isolated using qiagen rneasy® plant mini kit from three biological replicates per time point per the manufacturer’s protocol. the rna samples were treated with ambion® turbo dna-free™ dnase to get rid of any dna contamination in the rna samples. the rna samples were inspected for their quality and quantity using nanodrop® spectrophotometer and qubit® fluorometer.

sequencing, data processing, gene expression analysis and annotation under stress conditions
total rna from  <dig> samples that includes three control samples , and three biological replicates for each of the three time points  <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr under dehydration and salt stress was sent to the national center for genome resources  for sequencing on illumina® hiseq  <dig>  seven randomly chosen samples were multiplexed in each lane and three lanes of hiseq  <dig> were utilized to generate single-end short-reads of 1× <dig> bp lengths. the reads were aligned with gsnap  <cit>  using default settings with a maximum of  <dig> mis-matches allowed against the glycine max genome assembly and annotation v <dig>  from phytozome . the uniquely mapped reads that mapped to a single location in the genome were analyzed for differential gene expression between the control and treatment samples using the r package deseq v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . a gene was considered to be de if it satisfied the following three stringent filtering criteria:  p-value adjusted for multiple testing correction using benjamini and hochberg method  <cit>  to be less than  <dig> ,  two fold or greater fold change,  residual variance quotients of both the control and treatment samples of less than  <dig>  the residual variance criterion was used to filter genes that have significant variation between replicates, per recommendations in the deseq manual . the raw and the normalized read counts, and the sequence data has been deposited in ncbi’s gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through the geo series accession number gse <dig> 

the de genes were annotated using the top arabidopsis hit, and the corresponding gene ontology  biological process and molecular function terms were inferred  <cit> . the de genes under dehydration and salt stress were then screened separately for overrepresented go terms against all soybean genes using fisher’s exact test  <cit>  and bonferroni  <cit>  corrected significance value of less than  <dig> . the overrepresented go terms were enriched at the second level using blast2go v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and a reduced representation of enriched go terms was obtained. the de genes were also annotated using the soydb  <cit>  transcription factor  database, and fishers’s exact test followed by bonferroni correction was utilized to determine the overrepresented tf classes under each of the stress conditions.

screening of hd-zip gene promoters for conserved motifs of transcription factor binding sites 
for the purpose of this study, the one kilobase  region upstream of the annotated transcription start site for each gene was evaluated for promoter motifs. promoter sequences were retrieved using custom perl scripts for all gene models in the soybean genome. promoter sequences that were either less than one kb or included two or more ns were excluded from the analysis. the program clover  <cit>  was used to scan through a database of known motifs in transfac® v.  <dig>   <cit> . promoters of hd-zip genes belonging to each subfamily were scanned separately for enriched motifs against a background of all soybean gene promoters, with a p-value threshold of  <dig>  and an individual motif hit score of greater than or equal to  <dig>  similarly, promoters of genes that were de in at least one of the three time points under dehydration and salt stress were screened to identify overrepresented motifs under each of the stress treatments. the overrepresented motifs were filtered to include only plant motifs. a comparison was made between motifs that were overrepresented in the promoters of hd-zip genes belonging to each of the subfamilies and dehydration and salt stress treatments.

RESULTS
classification of hd-zip genes using phylogenetic analysis
a blastp search with the arabidopsis hd-zip genes against soybean, m. truncatula, grape and rice, followed by reconstruction of the phylogeny, clustered the sequences into four previously defined hd-zip subfamilies . hmms for each subfamily were used to determine subfamily membership and refine alignments. the outlier sequences excluded from the preliminary tree  included six sequences that belonged to the hd-zip iv subfamily and these were included in the final phylogenetic trees of the four subfamilies .figure  <dig>

based on the species clustering patterns and the number of copies of genes belonging to each species, we identified four old angiosperm clades in hd-zip ii, iii and iv, and five clades in hd-zip i . the topology of most of the angiosperm clades is generally consistent with the species tree. typically the two legume species  form a clade, with arabidopsis, grape, and rice each as increasingly distant outgroups from the legume sequences in the clade. the number of copies of genes of each species in each angiosperm clade reflects the number of wgd events the species has undergone. for instance, four of the five angiosperm clades in hd-zip i phylogeny included exactly three grape sequences – likely the result of the “gamma” triplication event that occurred around  <dig> mya  <cit> , and the angiosperm clade a <dig> in the hd-zip i phylogeny contains nine of the  <dig> possible soybean sequences - possibly the result of “gamma” triplication event , and the legume-  and glycine-specific  wgd events  <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes in soybean,  <dig> in arabidopsis,  <dig> in grape, and  <dig> each in m. truncatula and rice . the highest gene retention rate  among the five species is in hd-zip iv, whereas the hd-zip iii has the lowest  retention rate . although soybean has the highest number of genes, grape and rice have relatively higher retention rate of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . arabidopsis has the lowest retention rate of  <dig> %, whereas soybean and m. truncatula have intermediate retention rates of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . the varying rate of retention across the five species reflects the changes in the genomes of each of the species after wgd events. overall the phylogenetic analysis together with the wgd histories helps clarify our understanding of the evolution of each of the subfamilies.table  <dig>

validation of hd-zip genes using conserved domains, motifs and gene-structures
the hd-zip i and ii sequences contain the homeobox  domain and belong to the homeobox associated leucine zipper family . in addition, the hd-zip ii sequences contain the conserved residues “cpsce” at the carboxy terminal, and seven of the  <dig> hd-zip ii sequences contain a hd-zip_n  domain at the n-terminal. the hd-zip iii sequences are highly conserved among all five species along the complete length of the coding sequence . they contain the homeobox , start  and mekhla  domains. the hd-zip iv sequences contain the homeobox  and the start  domains. the presence of leucine zipper motif immediately following the homeodomain in hd-zip iii and iv sequences was confirmed using the sequence logos . exon-intron structures are characteristic for each subfamily . the hd-zip iii is particularly conserved, with each gene containing exactly  <dig> exons. the numbers of exons in genes in the hd-zip i, ii and iv subfamilies are in the ranges 1– <dig>  3– <dig>  and 8– <dig>  the hd-zip i and ii genes code for smaller proteins, with average peptide length of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, whereas hd-zip iii and iv genes code for average peptide lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids.

genomic locations of hd-zip genes in the soybean genome
the hd-zip genes are distributed on all  <dig> chromosomes in the soybean genome, typically in the more gene-dense euchromatic regions near chromosome ends . one hd-zip ii gene  was found on an unanchored scaffold  <dig>  the hd-zip genes generally do not occur in clusters or arrays, with only three instances of tandemly duplicated genes.figure  <dig> 
chromosomal locations and synteny relationships of soybean hd-zip genes. the chromosomal locations of the soybean hd-zip genes were obtained from the gff file of glycine max assembly v <dig> , annotation  <dig> , and were displayed using chromosome visualization tool . all chromosomes and gene locations are shown to scale. glyma0041s <dig> located on scaffold  <dig>  is included independently in the figure. the homoeologous gene pairs are identified with colored solid lines on the left side of the chromosomes. the chromosomes and the solid lines with identical colors are syntenic regions containing homoeologous genes. a detailed list of homoeologous hd-zip genes is also provided in additional file 13: table s <dig> 



genome duplications and expansion of hd-zip family in the soybean genome
copy number expansion of the hd-zip family in the soybean genome has primarily occurred through genome duplication events . each angiosperm clade in each of the four subfamilies  contains two to four soybean gene copies that are a result of retention of genes after the legume wgd  and/or the glycine-specific wgd . retention of genes following these wgds has been high, with retention of  <dig> of  <dig> hd-zip i ,  <dig> of  <dig> hd-zip ii ,  <dig> of  <dig> hd-zip iii , and  <dig> of  <dig>  hd-zip iv genes . there are two tandemly duplicated hd-zip pairs in subfamily iii, and another pair in subfamily iv. phylogenetic patterns indicate that the tandemly duplicated genes in subfamily iii further duplicated during a wgd event, giving rise to glyma07g <dig> and glyma07g <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and glyma08g <dig> and glyma08g <dig> on homoeologous chromosome  <dig>  genes glyma09g <dig> and glyma09g <dig>  in hd-zip iv, are another pair of tandemly duplicated genes. the glycine wgd event resulted in the homoeologous gene pair glyma09g <dig> and glyma15gg <dig>  whereas the homoeologous gene for glyma09g <dig> has evidently either been lost following the wgd – or the glyma09g <dig> and glyma09g <dig> duplication occurred after the glycine wgd. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> hd-zip genes are members of homoeologous gene pairs in the soybean genome.

expression of hd-zip genes in  <dig> conditions including  <dig> tissues of soybean
the expression of hd-zip genes was investigated using the g. max gene expression atlas reported by severin et al.  <cit> , and libault et al.  <cit> . of the  <dig> homoeologous gene pairs,  <dig> show expression in identical tissues . the remaining three show divergent patterns in different tissues between the wgd-derived paralogs . hd-zip i gene glyma06g <dig> was expressed in each of the  <dig> tissues, whereas the homoeolog glyma04g <dig> was expressed in the roots, “pod.shell.10daf” and “pod.shell.14daf”. hd-zip i gene glyma19g <dig> had expression in each of the  <dig> tissues, but the homoeolog glyma13g <dig> lacked expression in five “seed tissues” . hd-zip iv gene glyma11g <dig> was expressed only in the flower, whereas the homoeolog glyma01g <dig> was expressed in young leaf, flower, “one.cm.pod” and “pod.shell.10daf”. similar divergent gene expression patterns between these homoeologous genes were also noticed in the gene expression atlas reported by libault et al.  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

three hd-zip i , and four hd-zip iv  genes showed no expression in any of the  <dig> tissues investigated by severin et al.  <cit> . however, we found evidence of expression for glyma12g <dig> - hd-zip i in the roots subjected to dehydration stress after 12 hr . glyma06g <dig> - hd-zip i showed expression in leaf, flower and root tip, whereas glyma09g <dig> and glyma05g <dig> - hd-zip iv were expressed in green pods and shoot apical meristem respectively in libault et al.  <cit> . the remaining three genes had no evidence for expression  in either of the two atlases. these three genes did not reveal any frame shift mutations when investigated at the sequence level. hence, might be pseudogenes, or incorrectly predicted gene models – or they may only be expressed in certain tissues or under conditions that have not been sampled in this study.

based on the mean expression of genes across  <dig> tissues investigated by severin et al.  <cit> , hd-zip i and ii genes had relatively higher expression in roots and flowers; hd-zip iii in young leaves, “one cm pod”, and “pod shell 10 days after flowering”; and hd-zip iv in young leaves and flowers. similar results were observed using the expression atlas generated by libault et al.  <cit> , with the exception of highest mean expression of genes belonging to each of the subfamilies was noticed in shoot apical meristem. overall, hd-zip genes had expression in each of the  <dig> tissues.

the screening of hd-zip gene expression using mock-inoculated and b. japonicum-infected root hair cells at different time points highlighted hd-zip genes with more than two fold expression differences between control and treatment samples . more than 50% of the genes belonging to the hd-zip iii showed greater than two-fold difference between control and treatment samples at least at one time point .

expression of hd-zip genes under dehydration and salt stress using rna-seq
to identify hd-zip family members responsive to abiotic stress, we used an rna-seq approach. twenty-one samples were analyzed by rna-seq including three control samples , and three biological replicates for each of the three time points  <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr under dehydration and salt stress. the total number of reads generated in the rna-seq experiment from sequencing of  <dig> sample libraries was  <dig>  million, of which  <dig>  million  uniquely mapped to a single location in the soybean genome .table  <dig> 
experimental set-up and summary of read-count data from rna-seq analysis




we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes to be de in at least one of the three time points  under dehydration and salt stresses respectively  . salt stress resulted in mostly upregulation of genes, whereas dehydration stress caused downregulation of genes . the number of genes discarded from the differential expression analysis due to significant amount of variation between the replicates under dehydration and salt stress at a given time point ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the raw and deseq-normalized expression values for each gene model under both dehydration and salt stress at  <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr are provided in additional file 29: table s <dig> and additional file 30: table s <dig> respectively.

six genes were de at least at one of the three time points under dehydration stress : five in hd-zip i, and one in hd-zip ii. two genes were upregulated and the remaining four were downregulated under dehydration stress. glyma01g <dig> was significantly de at two different time points. three of the five de hd-zip i genes  belong to the angiosperm clade a <dig> , and were a result of the early-legume wgd and the recent glycine wgd.

we found sixteen genes de at one of the three time points under salt stress : seven in hd-zip i, four in hd-zip ii, one in hd-zip iii, and four in hd-zip iv. nine genes were upregulated and the remaining seven genes were downregulated under salt stress. five of the  <dig> genes were significantly de at two time points . four of the seven de hd-zip i genes were two homoeologous gene pairs . one of the pairs is a member of angiosperm clade a <dig>  and the other belongs to angiosperm clade a <dig> . one pair each from the hd-zip ii and hd-zip iv de genes  resulted from the early-legume wgd. the hd-zip iv gene glyma13g <dig> was not expressed under the control condition , but was upregulated after 12 hr under salt stress.figure  <dig>

the two hd-zip i genes, glyma01g <dig> and glyma16g <dig>  were de under both dehydration and salt stress. glyma01g <dig> was upregulated at the 6 hr and 12 hr time points under both stress treatments, whereas glyma16g <dig> was downregulated at the 6 hr time point under dehydration stress, and upregulated at the 12 hr time point under salt stress. in summary,  <dig> of the  <dig> hd-zip genes in soybean were de under either dehydration or salt stress, at least at one time point. eleven of these  <dig> genes shared a common ancestor either before the early-legume or the glycine wgds, implying conservation of gene functions following these genome duplications.

annotation of differentially expressed genes under dehydration and salt stress
in order to help evaluate and confirm results from the application of dehydration and salt stress treatments, go and tf enrichment analysis were performed on the de genes. under dehydration stress,  <dig> “biological process” and  <dig> “molecular function” terms were significantly  overrepresented, whereas  <dig> “biological process” and  <dig> “molecular function” terms were significantly  overrepresented under salt stress . the enriched biological processes and molecular functions include terms such as - “go: <dig> - response to water deprivation”, “go: <dig> - water channel activity”, and “go: <dig> - response to salt stress”, consistent with the experimental treatments . at the second level of go analysis, the biological process category “response to stimulus” was the most prevalent one under both stress treatments, followed by “cellular process” and “metabolic process” , while in the molecular function category, “catalytic activity” and “binding” were highly represented .figure  <dig> 
gene ontology biological process  and molecular function  categories significantly  overrepresented among differentially expressed genes under dehydration and salt stress. differentially expressed genes under dehydration and salt stress were annotated using the top arabidopsis hit, and then screened for overrepresented go terms against all soybean genes using fisher’s exact test  <cit>  and bonferroni  <cit>  corrected significance value of less than  <dig>  . the overrepresented go terms were enriched at the second level using blast2go v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and are shown in the figure.



we identified  <dig> and  <dig> tfs among the de genes under dehydration and salt stress treatments respectively . these tfs corresponded to  <dig> and  <dig> tf classes under dehydration and salt stress. using the enrichment analysis, we identified four tf classes, “wrky”, “ap2-erebp”, “zim” and “c2c <dig>  co-like” to be significantly  overrepresented under both stress treatments, whereas the tf class “nac” was overrepresented only under salt stress .table  <dig>

promoter analysis
the enrichment analysis performed with the clover program  <cit>  and the transfac database  <cit>  on the promoters of hd-zip genes identified four different transcription factor binding sites  overrepresented in the promoters of hd-zip i genes, and at least  <dig> different tfbss in hd-zip ii to iv genes . the genes belonging to the same subfamily had a diverse profile of tfbss enriched in the promoters, suggesting the possible role of promoter sequences in functional diversification of the hd-zip genes of the same subfamilies . the homoeologous genes in all subfamilies had reasonably different tfbss enriched in their promoters, suggesting specific regulation of homoeologous genes under particular conditions .table  <dig>

13pbf tfbs has two motif identifiers - m <dig> and m <dig>  counts of pbf tfbs’s irrespective of the identifier# were summed to estimate total count and proportion.



there are  <dig> tfbss overrepresented in the promoters of hd-zip genes as well as promoters of de genes under dehydration stress. similarly nine tfbss are overrepresented in the promoters of hd-zip genes and the promoters of de genes under salt stress . these tf classes are potential candidates that may influence both hd-zip genes as well genes involved in dehydration and salt stress responses.

the tfbss “dof3” and “pbf” are overrepresented in more than 90% of the hd-zip i and iv genes respectively, and “alfin1” is overrepresented in more than 90% of hd-zip ii and iii genes . hence, these transcription factors probably play an important role in regulating certain hd-zip genes.

finally, all but three tf classes corresponding to enriched tfbss in the promoters of hd-zip genes contain de genes under dehydration and salt stress . this observation is consistent with hd-zip genes playing important roles under dehydration and salt stress-responses.

discussion
identification and phylogenetic analysis of hd-zip genes
in this study we have identified and characterized  <dig> hd-zip genes in the soybean genome. recently,  <dig> hd-zip genes have been described in soybean  <cit> . chen et al.  <cit>  used blastp to identify  <dig> putative hd-zip transcription factors. smart and pfam analyses requiring both an hd and lz domain were used to refine the number of hd-zip genes to  <dig>  similarly, we initiated our study using blastp of arabidopsis hd-zip genes against the proteomes of soybean, m. truncatula, rice and grape. we then used phylogenetic analyses coupled with hmm searches, domain analyses, and known evolutionary relationships among the five species, to identify more diverse members of the hd-zip family in each of these species. using this approach, we were able to identify  <dig> additional novel hd-zip genes in soybean and identify the hd-zips in m. truncatula and grape, which had previously been unreported. not surprisingly, our approach had the biggest impact on the largely uncharacterized hd-zip iv genes. while chen et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> genes in hd-zip iv, we have found  <dig> genes. these genes may have novel biological functions.

by including multiple species in our search for hd-zip genes, we also improved the classification of the different family members in soybean and other species. the clustering of arabidopsis genes in the hd-zip subfamilies was consistent with the results of ariel et al.  <cit> . the hd-zip i and ii subfamilies can be classified into nine  and four  clades respectively that have been previously described in studies on arabidopsis, rice and maize  <cit>  . although the results in our study are consistent with the later classification, we suggest that the later strategy be used with discretion. one instance where it can lead to conflicting results is that the ζ clade has been described as monocot-specific clade in all previous studies  <cit> , but this clade clearly contained dicot sequences as a part of an old angiosperm clade in our study. one potential reason for this conflict is that the previous studies included only arabidopsis
 <cit>  or arabidopsis and c. plantagineum
 <cit>  as the dicot species. sampling of additional dicot sequences of soybean, m. truncatula and grape in this study provided a clearer picture of the taxonomic contexts of the hd-zip gene family.

we identified five ancient angiosperm clades in hd-zip i, and four in the hd-zip ii, iii and iv subfamilies. the presence of these multiple angiosperm clades in each subfamily is consistent with the recent discovery of two ancient wgd events, one occurring at the base of the angiosperm lineage  and the other before the angiosperm-gymnosperm split   <cit> . early diversification driven by multiple early-plant wgds is also consistent with a previous study of the evolution of hd-zip iii subfamily in land plants  <cit> . the presence of five angiosperm clades in hd-zip i  is intriguing and needs further investigation in the context of synteny analysis and inclusion of additional species in the phylogeny.

a phylogeny with eight species, including published hd-zip sequences from maize, poplar and cucumber, was largely congruent with the phylogeny generated using five species. these phylogenetic relationships will help identify orthologous genes, and accelerate functional characterizations studies.

conserved domains and gene structures for validation of hd-zip genes
pfam and sequence logos identify highly conserved domains and motifs in the hd-zip gene family. these have been reported in previous studies  <cit> , but we note two exceptions: arabidopsis hd-zip i gene at1g <dig> had an additional “rrm_1” , and medicago hd-zip iv gene mt.ctg127898_ <dig> had two start domains. overall, the highly conserved domains and motifs are the signatures of the hd-zip gene family and can be utilized to validate genes identified using several approaches.

exon-intron structures are generally well conserved in each hd-zip subfamily, particularly within each angiosperm clade. the hd-zip iii gene-structures were remarkably conserved, with each of the soybean genes having precisely  <dig> exons. considering hd-zip iii gene structures reported in other species, all genes in poplar had  <dig> exons  <cit> , and  <dig> of the  <dig> maize genes had  <dig> exons  <cit> , but in rice only one of the four genes had  <dig> exons  <cit> . the generally well-conserved exon structure in hd-zip iii genes across different species highlights the possibility of conserved gene function and strict regulation of these genes. in a recent study involving identification of genes that are potential targets of mirna in developing soybean seeds, all hd-zip iii genes were found to be targets of mirna  <dig>  <cit> . prigge and clark  <cit> , and floyd and bowman  <cit>  have previously suggested that hd-zip iii sequences across all land plants produce transcripts that could be targeted by mirna <dig> and mirna <dig>  derocher and nguyen  <cit>  overexpressed arabidopsis hd-zip iii gene revoluta in soybean embryo, leading to seed yield increase with no change in the seed composition. in short, the hd-zip iii genes appear to be both highly conserved and under intricate transcriptional regulation.

expansion of hd-zip gene family
the  <dig> hd-zip genes in soybean is the highest number reported so far in any angiosperm species, comparing with  <dig> in arabidopsis
 <cit> ,  <dig> in maize  <cit> ,  <dig> in rice  <cit> , and  <dig> in poplar  <cit> . the hd-zip genes in soybean have expanded during the early-legume wgd event , and the glycine wgd event , with high retention of paralogs. expansion of the hd-zip gene family due to wgds has been previously reported in other species. the arabidopsis, rice, maize and poplar have at least 75%, 50%, 62% and 81% homoeologous gene pairs respectively . however, in cucumber, a species that lacks wgd events since eudicot radiation, there are no homoeologous gene pairs among hd-zip i and iv   <cit> . these results imply that the hd-zip gene family has expanded in a species-specific manner, with copy number generally depending on wgd events and high retention rates after duplications.

gene families can be broadly categorized as having high rates of retention of segmental  duplicates and low generation or retention of tandem duplicates – or vice versa   <cit> . the low-tandem/high-segmental duplication class of gene families has been reported to comprise highly conserved, housekeeping, and key regulatory gene families  <cit>  – for example, transcription factor families such as heat shock and wrky, housekeeping families such as mitochondrial carrier proteins  <cit> , and the proteasome 20s subunit family  <cit> . clearly, the hd-zip superfamily falls in the “high segmental, low tandem” category, with only three tandem duplication events in the hd-zip genes in soybean. the expansion and retention of the hd-zip family during segmental duplication events will have consequences for functional characterization studies, due to the possibility of genetic redundancy in duplicated genes.

gene expression patterns of hd-zip genes in  <dig> conditions, including  <dig> tissues
the g. max expression atlas  <cit>  was initially utilized for investigating gene expression patterns of hd-zip genes in  <dig> tissues of soybean. the average expression values across  <dig> tissues for each subfamily was highly variable, and there were genes with extremely high expression relative to the average expression across tissues in each of the subfamily. investigating gene expression patterns separately for each subfamily on a log2-transformed scale helped identify gene expression patterns that were unreported in chen et al.  <cit> . chen et al.  <cit>  displayed expression of all four subfamilies on a single scale using average linkage clustering method. in addition we utilized two additional gene expression atlases developed by libault et al.  <cit> , which allowed investigation of hd-zip genes in three additional tissues, and seven different conditions.

all but three homoeologous gene pairs show consistent expression in the same tissues between the wgd-derived paralogs, suggesting retention of hd-zip gene functions after genome duplications. the genome duplication events provide raw materials for new gene functions. the duplicated gene can evolve to have a new function   <cit>  or can acquire new deleterious mutations and become a pseudogene ; or both the ancestral and the newly formed gene can undergo reduction in their levels and patterns of activity, such that jointly their function matches with that of the ancestral gene   <cit> .

rna-seq based expression profiling of soybean genes during dehydration and salt stress
rna-seq analysis was utilized to investigate genes involved in dehydration and salt stress. the expression of all soybean genes including the  <dig> hd-zip genes identified in this study was studied in the roots of soybean cv. williams  <dig> at v <dig> stage, at four different time points, and under dehydration and salt stress. the evaluation of plants at the v <dig> stage may assist in identification of candidate genes involved in initiation of dehydration and salt stress. recently, chen et al.  <cit>  reported the influence of drought and salinity stress on hd-zip genes using publicly available microarray data sets available at national center for biotechnology information under accession numbers gse <dig> and gse <dig>  the microarray datasets facilitated investigation of the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> hd-zip genes identified in their study. the microarray dataset gse <dig> reports expression of genes in the leaves under drought stress imposed at late developmental stages , whereas the dataset gse <dig> describes expression of genes in  <dig> d seedlings utilizing pooled rna samples from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 hr of mock and salinity stressed plants. thus, in the current study, the utilization of root tissue at the v <dig> stage, and investigation of gene expression separately at each of the four time points  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12 hr provided clearly different and more precise insight into genes that are involved in dehydration and salt stress.

we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes to be de in the roots of soybean cv. williams  <dig> at the v <dig> stage at least at one of the three time points  under dehydration and salt stress respectively. partial validation of de genes for their role in abiotic stress responses was obtained by performing go and tf enrichment analysis. the highly represented biological process go categories, “response to stimulus”, “cellular process”, and “metabolic process” as well as the molecular function categories, “catalytic activity” and “binding”, are generally found to be enriched during abiotic stress responses . similarly, the four tf classes wrky , ap2-erebp , zim  and c2c <dig>  co-like  , and nac   are major tfs that have previously been shown to play critical role in stress responses, and are consistent with results reported in this study.

expression profiling of hd-zip genes under dehydration stress
rna-seq analysis identified  <dig> hd-zip genes de in the roots of soybean cv. “williams 82”, under dehydration and salt stress. the role of hd-zip genes in regulation of developmental adaptation under different environmental stress conditions has been previously established in arabidopsis, medicago, rice, sunflower, maize, cucumber, and poplar .

all six genes identified as de in the roots under dehydration stress in this study, were also, de under drought stress in leaves  <cit> . four of the five de hd-zip i genes belong to the angiosperm clade a <dig>  this clade contains genes such as cphb- <dig> from c. plantagineum, and zmhdz <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> from maize, that have previously been shown to have a role in water-stress response  <cit> . chen et al.  <cit>  showed glyma06g <dig> de in this study was de under dehydration stress, in the roots of drought-tolerant soybean genotype, “jindou21”.

hd-zip i gene glyma16g <dig> that is de under dehydration stress belongs to the angiosperm clade a <dig>  genes in this clade have been extensively characterized for their role in water-stress responses in other species. for example, the arabidopsis athb <dig> and athb <dig> genes have been shown to reduce plant growth under water-deficit condition  <cit> . the sunflower hahb <dig> gene is strongly induced by water deficit stress  <cit> , and when over-expressed in arabidopsis the plants exhibit increased survival by a process that inhibits-drought related senescence  <cit> . the n. attenuata nahd <dig> gene is induced in roots under water-deficit conditions  <cit> . the rice oshox <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes are involved in drought-responsiveness  <cit> . hence, we hypothesize that the soybean gene glyma16g <dig> may have a role under water-deficit stress response and is a potential candidate for functional characterization.

hd-zip ii gene glyma08g <dig> that is de under dehydration stress is an ortholog of rice genes oshox <dig> and oshox <dig>  which have also been demonstrated to be involved in drought-response  <cit> .

in summary, the hd-zip i and ii genes show differential expression patterns under dehydration stress that are consistent with the water-deficit stress response functions of orthologous genes previously identified in studies of water stress. these results support that hd-zip i and ii genes may generally have a role, conserved across many angiosperm species, in mediating water-stress responses; and that these genes may be viable targets for developing more drought-tolerant soybean cultivars.

expression profiling of hd-zip genes under salt stress
a subset of hd-zip genes, from each of the four subfamilies, responded to salt  stress in the roots, in at least one of the three time points. six of the  <dig> genes  de under salt stress have been recently shown to respond to salt stress, in  <dig> d old seedlings of soybean plant, in a microarray experiment  <cit> .

the hd-zip i gene glyma13g <dig> was downregulated under salt stress, which is similar to the expression of its arabidopsis orthologs, athb <dig> and athb <dig>  which are similarly downregulated under salt stress  <cit> . the homoeologous genes glyma01g <dig> and glyma11g <dig> were upregulated after 12 hr of salt stress, comparable to the arabidopsis orthologs, athb <dig>  athb <dig> and athb <dig>  which are upregulated more than two-fold under salt stress  <cit> .

two of the four de hd-zip iv genes, glyma13g <dig> and glyma13g <dig>  had nearly zero expression under control conditions, but were upregulated under salt stress, suggesting a possible role in root development under stress conditions. glyma <dig> and glyma07g <dig> are orthologs of the arabidopsis gene glabra <dig>  which has been functionally characterized and shown to regulate root hair development, and cell specification of root epidermis in salt stressed plants .

the two homoeologous hd-zip i genes  upregulated under salt stress belong to the angiosperm clade “a3”. this clade contains the functionally characterized medicago gene mthb <dig> . mthb <dig> is induced in the roots under aba and salt stress, and regulates lateral root emergence in medicago
 <cit> . the reduction of lateral root emergence by mthb <dig>  under salt stress, is a mechanism to minimize the exposure of plant roots to excess salt in the soil.

the hd-zip i gene glyma01g <dig> was upregulated at  <dig> and 12 hr time points under both salt and dehydration stress. this gene was also upregulated under both drought and salt stress in the leaves and seedlings, respectively, in two microarray experiments  <cit> . a blastp search with glyma01g <dig> protein sequence against the patent database  <cit>  found a match  with sequences in five “patent applications”  that described the role of this sequence in improving plant performance under abiotic stress.

functional diversity and regulation of hd-zip genes
the presence of highly diverse tfbss enriched in the promoters of hd-zip genes provides evidence for functional diversity. previous studies have mainly focused on hd-zip target-sequences, and regulatory regions adjacent to the dna-binding domain of hd-zip genes. all experimentally tested hd-zip i genes have been shown to bind specifically, and with high affinity to target-sequences comprising of the same pseudopalindromic sequence caatattg, under in vitro conditions . arce et al.  <cit>  reported the presence of activation domain, sumoylation, and phosphorylation sites in the carboxy-terminal regions, and some putative regulatory regions in the amino-terminal regions, as being responsible for the functional diversity of hd-zip i genes.

the “dof3” and “pbf” tfbss are enriched in more than 90% of hd-zip i and iv gene promoters respectively. the “dof” tfs like hd-zip are plant-specific tfs and are involved in several process, for example stress-responses , phytochrome signaling  <cit> , light-responses  <cit> , responses to plant hormones including auxin  <cit>  and gibberellin  <cit> , and seed germination  <cit> . pbf also known as whirly family are known to regulate plant defense gene expression  <cit> .

the tfbs “alfin1” is overrepresented in more than 90% of hd-zip ii and iii gene promoters. “alfin1” tfs are shown to contribute toward salt tolerance in plants  <cit> .

finally, the presence of highly diverse tfbss enriched in the promoters of hd-zip genes, both within and across subfamilies, suggests the complex integration of hd-zip genes in various signal-transduction pathways, with a potential source for functional diversity of these highly conserved hd-zip genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have described the soybean hd-zip gene superfamily. evolutionary histories, interpreted in the context of whole genome duplication events and analysis of gene structures, provide additional verification for the classification of the soybean hd-zip genes. the hd-zip genes in the soybean genome were preferentially retained after the legume-specific and/or glycine-specific whole genome duplication events. the rna-seq experiment identified candidate genes that may be involved in dehydration and salt stress responses.
