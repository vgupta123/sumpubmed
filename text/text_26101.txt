BACKGROUND
the eastern oyster, crassostrea virginica  occurs naturally in the western atlantic from the gulf of st. lawrence in canada to the gulf of mexico, caribbean, and coasts of brazil and argentina  <cit> . this species has been introduced to the pacific coast of north america, europe, and hawaii but it has maintained reproducing populations in only two localities outside its natural range, namely, in a river in british columbia and in a small basin in hawaii  <cit> . it thrives in estuaries and coastal areas and is present in some areas as extensive reefs. these reefs are vital components of estuarine ecosystems because they not only serve as habitat for many fishes but also as a refuge for them and for some reef-associated invertebrates when environmental conditions become stressful  <cit> . the eastern oyster is an economically important species in north america as natural populations are being harvested extensively. it is also being cultivated in many areas. the eastern oyster populations have been threatened by overfishing and habitat degradation as a result of expanding utilization of coastlines and other anthropogenic disturbances  <cit> . outbreak of major diseases such as dermo  and msx  have devastated both farmed and wild populations of the oyster species.

oysters are a fundamental component of the aquatic ecosystem in addition to their importance to fisheries and aquaculture industries. as filter-feeding bivalves, oysters play a critical role in maintaining water quality  <cit> . the eastern oyster has also been used as a marine bivalve model to study the effects of environmental stressors  <cit>  and as bioindicators of estuarine pollution  <cit> . a number of genome resources have been developed from the eastern oyster including construction of a framework genetic linkage map  <cit> , construction of large-insert bac libraries  <cit> , initial analysis of expressed sequence tags   <cit> , and construction of the first generation microarray  <cit> .

est analysis is not only the most efficient approach for gene discovery, but also an effective approach for the identification of polymorphic dna markers such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit>  that are highly useful for genetic mapping and comparative genome analysis. however, est analysis in the eastern oysters has been hindered by highly abundantly expressed genes in oysters including a very high proportion of mitochondrial genes  <cit> . compared to the very large efforts for the development of est resources for the pacific oysters , the est resource in the eastern oyster is small. to date, only  <dig>  ests have been deposited to genbank from c. virginica. due to high redundancy rate of the oyster ests, the unique genes represented by these ests are relatively small. the objectives of this study were to construct a normalized cdna library for efficient generation of unique ests from the eastern oysters, and to generate additional ests from the normalized cdna library. here we report the construction of a high-quality normalized cdna library and the generation and analysis of  <dig>  ests.

the number of microsatellite markers available for mapping has been low. to date, there are about  <dig> microsatellite markers developed from the eastern oyster. seven  polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed from a size-selected  partial genome library  <cit> . eighteen  microsatellite markers were developed by screening  <dig> clone sequences for microsatellite repeats from a small-insert c. virginica genomic library  <cit> . sixty one  est-linked microsatellite markers were developed by screening eastern oyster sequences from public databases  <cit> . three  microsatellites were isolated from c. virginica genomic dna  <cit> . eleven  microsatellites were originally developed from c. gigas which also yielded cross-species amplifications in c. virginica  <cit> . the remaining four microsatellite markers were developed by the haskin shellfish research laboratory at rutgers university, usa  <cit> . in this work, we have identified  <dig> microsatellites within the sequenced ests, of which  <dig> have sufficient flanking sequences for primer design. using the sequenced ests, along with those ests already existing in the genbank, we identified  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphic sites that are potentially useful for genetic linkage mapping and qtl analysis in this species.

RESULTS
generation of ests and contig assembly
a total of  <dig>  randomly picked est clones were sequenced, producing  <dig>  readable sequences . after removal of clones with no inserts or very short inserts , a total of  <dig>  high-quality ests  were produced with an average length of  <dig> bp. the cumulative length of all high-quality est sequences was  <dig> , <dig> bases. all the ests have been deposited to genbank with continuous accession numbers of eh <dig> – eh <dig> 

the ests were subjected to cluster analysis using three software, phrap, cap <dig>  and vector nti advance™  <dig>  with the final contigs assembled with vector nti advance™  <dig>  a total of  <dig> contigs were assembled consisting of  <dig>  ests while  <dig>  sequences were singletons . thus, this est project allowed identification of  <dig>  unique sequences. of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> contained  <dig> ests ;  <dig> contained  <dig> ests ;  <dig> contained  <dig> ests; four contained  <dig> ests, three contained  <dig> ests; and one contained  <dig> ests . clearly, most of the clusters were small, a reflection of high efficiency in normalization and subtraction. the single large cluster was from mitochondrial sequences, and that could have been missed in the subtraction.

the ests generated from this study were searched against ests of c. virginica in dbest using blastn. of the  <dig>  unique sequences generated in this study,  <dig>  had significant hits  with existing ests from c. virginica, while  <dig>   were found to be novel c. virginica ests. therefore, this est collection represented a significant addition to the existing oyster est resources.

putative identities of the ests
in order to make an assessment for the putative identities of the sequenced ests, all ests were subjected to blastx similarity searches. of the  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig>   had significant matches  to the non-redundant  protein database using blastx . of the unique sequences with matched homologies in the nr protein database, seven  had an e-value of 1e- <dig> or less  and are therefore considered highly significant homology  <cit> . about 58% had significant homology  and thus, are considered moderately similar  <cit> . about 42% of the ests were assigned weak homology  and are therefore weakly similar. among the various organisms that have protein sequences in genbank, the c. virginica ests generated from this study had the highest number of blastx hits to the purple sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus , followed by zebrafish danio rerio , honey bee apis melifera , and chicken gallus gallus  . among the organisms listed in "other" ,  <dig> ests  had significant hits to c. virginica proteins in the database and  <dig> ests  had hits with the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.

of the putatively identified genes,  <dig> different putative proteins were related to stress response,  <dig> were related to immune response, and  <dig> were related to defense responses . these genes are of interest for further studies in relation to disease resistance, and stress responses of oysters, a significant issue in oyster industries.


                              stress response

                              immune response

                              defense response
of the  <dig>  unique sequences without significant matches to the nr protein database,  <dig>  had matches using the blastn algorithm . all of these correspond to mtdna sequences.

gene ontology annotation
gene ontology  categories were assigned to  <dig>  unique ests with blastx hits using blast2go. figure  <dig> shows the percentage distributions of gene ontology terms  according to the go consortium. cellular physiological process  was the most dominant 3rd level term out of the  <dig> unique sequences which were annotated to the biological process go category. this was followed by metabolism at 62%. only 4% were assigned to the biological process subcategory response to stress. protein binding  was the most dominant out of  <dig> ests with significant protein hits which were assigned to molecular function category at 3rd level. this was followed by hydrolase activity and nucleotide binding at 17% each. go terms at higher and lower levels for each of the three main go categories as well as the unique ests which fall on each term are given in additional file  <dig> 

microsatellites-containing ests
thirty-five  microsatellites were found in  <dig> of the  <dig>  unique est sequences using msatfinder. the major types of the identified microsatellites were dinucleotide  and trinucleotide  . of the  <dig> unique ests with microsatellites,  <dig> have sufficient flanking sequences for the design of  <dig> primers, and are therefore potentially useful for genetic linkage mapping. two  of the  <dig> microsatellite-containing ests have significant matches to the nr database. these are contig  <dig>  which is homologous to an unnamed protein product in tetraodon nigroviridis and contig  <dig>  which is homologous to a predicted protein similar to axonemal leucine-rich repeat protein in strongylocentrotus purpuratus. of the microsatellites containing ests, two contigs were assembled. in silico comparison of the sequences included in the two contigs indicated that the one microsatellite was polymorphic while the other microsatellite was not polymorphic between the two sequenced ests.

single nucleotide polymorphism
single nucleotide polymorphism  has recently become the marker type of choice for linkage and qtl analysis. in most cases, snp discovery has relied on genomic sequencing, bac end sequencing, or targeted snp discovery  <cit> . in the eastern oyster, there have been no reports on large-scale snp identification. in this study, we took advantage of the existing ests with high redundancy along with the ests reported here. a total of  <dig>  contigs were assembled including  <dig>  oyster est sequences. a total of  <dig>  putative snps were identified including  <dig>  transitions,  <dig>  transversions, and  <dig>  indels . these snps represented a rate of  <dig>  snp per  <dig> base pairs. however, as the quality scores were not available for all ests used in the analysis, the putative snps could have been caused by sequencing errors as well as the true snps. in order to provide some assessment of the snps, the putative snps were categorized based on the contig sizes. clearly, the larger the number of sequences involved in a contig, the more likely the snps can be checked as to whether the putative snps represent sequence errors or real snps. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig>   putative snps were identified from contigs with only two sequences;  <dig>   putative snps were identified from contigs with three sequences;  <dig>   putative snps were identified from contigs with four sequences; and  <dig>  putative snps were identified from contigs with five or more sequences .

discussion
this work produced a total of  <dig>  ests representing  <dig>  unique sequences. this est collection represents the largest number of unique sequences from the eastern oysters. previous efforts in est sequencing from this species revealed a high level of sequencing redundancy, largely due to very high proportion of mitochondrial genes  <cit> . in this work, the cdna library was normalized, along with subtraction of the most abundantly expressed genes as determined from previous est sequencing efforts. cluster analysis indicated that only one contig was large representing mitochondrial sequences. for the most part, however, the normalized/subtracted cdna library allowed efficient generation of unique est sequences. this suggested that not only normalization, but also subtraction is required for the construction of cdna libraries suitable for large-scale est analysis in oysters. our est analysis here had a gene discovery rate of  <dig> %, or a redundancy rate of  <dig> %. clearly, this is a reflection of the quality of the normalized library. as shown in figure  <dig>  after sequencing of  <dig>  some clones, the rate of gene discovery was still in the linear phase in relation to the number of sequenced clones. this warrants the use of this normalized cdna library for additional est sequencing when funding situation permits.

similarity searches of the newly generated ests against the existing ests in the dbest revealed that of the  <dig>  unique sequences generated in this study, only  <dig>  had significant hits with existing ests from c. virginica, while  <dig>   were found to be novel c. virginica ests. therefore, this est collection represented a significant addition to the existing oyster est resources. these novel ests should provide the material basis for the new editions of the oyster microarrays.

the high percentage of c. virginica ests  with no hits in the protein database implies that there is an enormous potential for discovery of new genes in this organism and possibly new gene networks and metabolic pathways  <cit> . however, we realize that the ests were relatively short, and many of the ests could still be within the 5' untranslated region  such that their identities could not be revealed by sequence similarity comparisons. efforts should be made in the generation of complete cdna sequences in this species in order to provide a greater level of assessment of its gene contents and similarities to various other species in the evolutionary spectrum.

a number of stress-, immune-, and defense-related transcripts were putatively identified from this study . these genes are of particular interest to oyster researchers because of relentless environmental pressure on natural and farmed oyster populations brought about by the increasing use of coastal zones and also because of the devastating effects of diseases  <cit> . in this study, go annotation of sequences with protein matches in nr database identified  <dig> distinct transcripts which are potentially involved in stress responses,  <dig> distinct transcripts that are potentially involved in immune responses, and  <dig> distinct transcripts that are potentially involved in defense responses . while many of these genes were reported in previous studies on c. virginica ests  <cit> , additional studies of these genes are needed to determine their expression in relation to stresses or diseases in order to develop molecular indicators for environmental stresses.

among the myriad of applications of ests is the development of microsatellite and snp markers. this work allowed the identification of  <dig> microsatellite-containing ests, of which  <dig> had sufficient flanking sequences for primer design. these microsatellites should be useful for genetic linkage mapping in this species. however, polymorphism needs to be tested in specific resource families. a large number  of putative snps were identified from the overlapping sequences of ests. these putative snps are potentially useful for genetic linkage mapping and for the analysis of quantitative traits of the eastern oysters. however, validation and polymorphic analysis must be performed before these putative snps can be used. that is because a large proportion of these putative snps were identified from contigs with just two or three sequences. in the absence of the quality scores, it was not possible for us to differentiate the true snps from sequence errors. in spite of this setback, the putative snps identified from this study represent the first large set of snps from the eastern oysters. with additional validation, as well as testing in specific resource families for their polymorphism will make them useful markers for genetic analysis in oysters. in a recent study, over 80% of the snps derived from genbank sequences have been validated as true snps in the eastern oyster  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a high-quality normalized/subtracted cdna library was constructed as determined by the high gene discovery rate  with over  <dig>  clones of ests being sequenced. we have generated  <dig>  ests representing  <dig>  unique sequences. of the  <dig>  unique sequences, the majority  were novel ests for this species. therefore, this est collection represents a significant addition to the existing est resources of the eastern oysters. a good fraction  of the unique ests had significant similarities to known sequences in genbank. these ests should serve as valuable resources for the development of microarrays useful for functional genomic analysis. in addition to the use as est resources, we have also identified putative microsatellite and snp markers. once validated and tested for polymorphism, these microsatellite and snp markers should be useful for genetic linkage and qtl analysis in oysters.
