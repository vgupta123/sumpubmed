BACKGROUND
the genus vulpes  comprises of twelve extant species that inhabit diverse habitats, including subtropics, deserts, temperate climatic zones as well as the arctic  <cit> . the arctic fox  is the only fox species occurring in the arctic and is adapted to its extreme climatic conditions. arctic foxes have to cope with extremely cold and dark winters without being able to hibernate, followed by short summer seasons to reproduce. several evolutionary adaptations such as insulating and camouflage colored fur, a compact body, and reduced metabolism during starvation or extremely cold weather enable arctic foxes to survive under these harsh conditions  <cit> .

a closely related species of the arctic fox is the red fox . the two species diverged from their most recent common ancestor approximately  <dig>  million years ago   <cit> . in contrast to the arctic fox, the red fox occupies a wide range of predominantly temperate habitats, including forests, farmland, urban areas, but also deserts and tundra. the generalist habitat requirements of the red fox and its high mobility are drivers for the evolutionary success of this species, which has the widest geographical distribution of any carnivore  <cit> . the closely related arctic and red foxes differ in their morphological and ecological adaptations to their respective habitats, rendering them an interesting species pair for studying the genetic basis of adaptation.

the adaptations of the two fox species are expected to have left signatures in the protein-coding genes. a widely used method to identify candidate genes that are under positive selection is calculating the dn-ds ratio . this is the ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site  and the number of synonymous substitution per synonymous site . an ω >  <dig> indicates positive selection, an ω <  <dig> indicates negative  selection, while an ω ≈  <dig> implies neutral evolution  <cit> . different methods have been developed to calculate the ω values ranging from pair wise comparisons  <cit>  to phylogeny based methods  <cit> . phylogeny based methods have the advantage to implement maximum-likelihood and evolutionary models to identify positive selection on specific lineages, rather than averaging over sequences between species pairs  <cit> . the model-based branch site test “test 2” implemented in the paml package  <cit>  uses a phylogenetic tree to identify branch  specific selection at individual codons with an empirical bayes approach. “test 2” has been shown to be robust and yield fewer false positives compared to other methods  <cit> . the pairwise analyses and branch site test may not necessarily yield overlapping results but complement each other, because by averaging over the entire protein-coding sequence the pairwise analysis is more conservative than the branch site tests.

recent studies analyzing whole genomes of polar and brown bears, an arctic/non-arctic species pair with comparable habitat ranges and adaptations to that of arctic and red foxes, identified a number of candidate genes involved in fatty-acid metabolism, cardiovascular functions, and fur color to be under positive selection  <cit> . from the two fox species, whole genome sequences are not available, to investigate if a similar set of genes is under selection, to study possible convergent evolution between foxes as reported in other mammals  <cit> . however transcriptome sequencing can economically produce large amounts of protein-coding sequence data for evolutionary analysis . another benefit is that de novo sequence assembly of transcriptome data is less complex than for whole genomes. therefore, the aim of this study is to produce transcriptomes of arctic and red foxes for identifying candidate genes and metabolic pathways that might be involved in arctic adaptation and to estimate phylogenomic based divergence times. genes under positive selection will be chosen from transcripts with high abundance in terms of fragments per kilobase per transcript per million mapped reads  and transcriptomes from two fox individuals will be used to verify the sequence data. compared with positive selection analyses of data from a single individual, this stringent approach reduces sequencing and assembly errors that can introduce a bias in positive selection analysis  <cit> . in addition we compare sequence variation between the two fox species and the dog , and we provide a resource of potential variable microsatellites, which will be useful in future population studies.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and functional annotation of arctic and red fox genes
three transcriptome libraries were generated from pooled rna-extracts from different tissues  of two arctic fox individuals  and one red fox . the sequencing produced more than  <dig> million reads with an average read length of  <dig> base pairs, bp . standard quality filtering of raw reads to remove adapters, low quality reads  and using minimum read length of 30 bp resulted in the removal of on average  <dig>  % reads . statistics of the de novo assembly of each of the three fox individuals are shown in table  <dig>  filtering steps that included abundance filtration by selecting transcripts with fpkm ≥  <dig> and grouping similar transcripts on the basis of sequence similarity  discarded on an average 46 % transcripts for each of the three fox samples . in addition we checked fpkm of orthologous genes between the arctic and red foxes by mapping the reads of one fox species to itself and to another fox species assembly, indicating that the orthologous genes expression are positive correlated   confirming the assembly quality and a similar expression pattern.table  <dig>

in addition the two arctic fox individuals were used to generate a pooled assembly. lab id is shown in brackets



functional annotation of all assembled and identified expressed transcripts using blast2go resulted in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts that have at least one gene ontology  term, for arctic fox <dig>  arctic fox <dig> and red fox respectively corresponding to an average of approximately 35 % of each of the final transcripts. the remaining unannotated transcripts might represent non-coding rnas, 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions, or fox-specific transcripts. go annotation based on the goslim database divided the functional annotations into the three main ontology components: “biological process”, “molecular function” and “cellular component”. the distribution of the number of genes in the three different go subcategories for each species is shown in fig.  <dig>  the similar distribution in three go categories of the two arctic fox and red fox genes indicates that no major bias was introduced during the generation of the cdna libraries. in the category “biological process” the largest number of genes was assigned to cellular processes, single organism processes and metabolic processes. in the category “molecular function”, binding and catalytic activity received most transcripts, and in the category “cellular component”, most genes were assigned to the “cell and organelle” category.fig.  <dig> gene ontology category distribution of three fox individuals transcripts. gene ontology categories include biological process , molecular function  and cellular component 



after coding sequence  prediction of the transcripts, only cds longer than  <dig> nucleotides  were annotated to avoid spurious hits. all cds were screened against the human protein database using blast and 82 % of the fox genes could be annotated . the remaining, un-annotated genes were searched in the ncbi non-redundant database, identifying an additional 1 % of the cdss. in total, about  <dig>  individual protein coding genes  that are unique in the database could be identified for each of the three fox samples after annotation.fig.  <dig> fox coding sequence hits to the human and the non-redundant databases. the number of annotated genes for each of the three fox individuals. the black bars indicate the total number of predicted cds, the grey bars the number of predicted cds that have a homologue in the human protein database. the brown bars indicates the unannoated cds from human protein database identified in non-redundant database



identification of  <dig> genes under positive selection in the two fox species
we identified a total of  <dig>  orthologous genes between arctic and red fox, of which  <dig>  remained after the different quality filtration steps for further analyses. of these,  <dig> candidate genes were identified to be under positive selection with ω >  <dig>  functional annotation using biomart against the dog genome and non-redundant database identified  <dig> genes to be associated with various important biological and molecular functions . the pairwise mean ω value for all the orthologous genes was  <dig>  and a histogram of all the pairwise ω values shows the overall rate of selection on the orthologous genes, implying strong negative selection for most of the genes . out of  <dig> only  <dig> have been annotated, the rest of the other genes that could not be annotated with biomart or non-redundant database are therefore most likely fox-specific transcripts. in addition to the pairwise selection analyses, a branch site test was performed for the arctic fox and red fox branch, respectively. an orthology search identified  <dig>  orthologs among four carnivores  of which  <dig>  genes remained for the branch site test after the removal of all gaps. the branch site test identified four genes to be under positive selection in the arctic fox transcriptome and eight genes in the red fox transcriptome. only two genes  were identified to be under positive selection by both methods, pairwise and branch-site analyses. the reason for this limited overlap may be a consequence of different methodologies and dataset sizes. the ten candidate genes additionally identified by the branch site test complement the findings by the pairwise analyses. the annotation indicates that the identified positively selected genes of the branch site test are involved in molecular and cellular functions such as lipid metabolism and nuclear chromatin fragmentation .table  <dig> positively selected genes with functions, identified in arctic and red fox using the branch site test

phylogenomic analyses reveal that arctic fox and red fox diverged  <dig> million years ago
after screening the carnivore genomes for orthologous genes we retained  <dig>  genes with the total length of  <dig> ,724 nt ). the gtr + g model was identified as the most likely substitution model for the nt data and mix + g was the preferred model for the aa data. both the nt and aa data sets yielded the same tree topology in maximum likelihood analyses . divergence time estimates obtained from using all nt sites and three fossil calibration points indicated that the two fox species diverged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma . divergence time estimation on a data set consisting of only synonymous sites yielded a similar value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among six carnivore species. the topology was calculated from a  <dig> ,724 nt long data set, and the divergence times were based on three well established fossil calibration points inside carnivora. the cat was used as an outgroup . the values at each branch indicate the estimated mean divergence time  ± standard deviation. the scale bar is in million years 



low levels of genetic variation in the arctic fox
in total, approximately 70 % of the correctly paired reads from each of the three fox individuals could be mapped to the dog genome. between the dog and each of the three fox individuals, in total  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> , and  <dig> , <dig>  substitutions were found, respectively . approximately 40 % of all substitutions found between the dog genome and arctic and red foxes were shared between the three fox individuals . a search for heterozygous sites  within each fox individual identified fewer snps in the two arctic foxes as compared to the red fox. increasing the threshold for the minimal read coverage increased the absolute values somewhat, but not the relative ones . the snps identified within the three fox individuals will provide a valuable resource for population genetic studies.fig.  <dig> comparative nucleotide differences  in the three fox individuals. a venn diagram showing the number of variable sites for each of the three fox samples compared to the dog genome, and the degree of shared variable sites among the three foxes. b frequency of heterozygous sites  in the three fox individuals at different read coverages 



five genes stretching exon and intron boundaries  were selected for sanger-sequencing to verify the quality of the assembled transcriptome data. amplification and sequencing of the same fox individuals that were used for the transcriptome sequencing identified no differences between the sanger and illumina data confirming the high quality of de novo assemblies. in total,  <dig> non-synonymous and four synonymous substitutions were identified among the three individuals. amplification and sequencing of three additional fox individuals  revealed  <dig> additional substitutions . nucleotide and haplotype diversity levels were similar or higher in red foxes compared to arctic foxes . genetic variation networks  show that for theses five genes, haplotypes were not shared between red and arctic foxes.

numerous microsatellites suitable for population studies identified in the transcriptome
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> di-, tri- and tetra-repeat unit microsatellites were identified in the arctic and red fox transcripts respectively. while the sequences have not been tested for variability in population samples from the two species yet, they were selected for numerous repeat units. thus, the identified microsatellite loci will be a valuable resource for future population studies . trinucleotide microsatellites represented 60 % of the total number of identified microsatellites, additional file 9: table s <dig> lists newly designed  <dig> microsatellite primer pairs each for arctic and red foxes that can be used for population genetic studies.

discussion
the present study identified positively selected genes in the transcriptomes of the red and the arctic fox, two species that thrive in different climatic conditions. arctic and red foxes evolved different morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations  <cit> . pairwise positive selection analyses identified positive selection signatures in  <dig> of the protein-coding genes of which  <dig> genes could be successfully annotated and branch site analyses identified four and eight genes in the arctic and red fox respectively, to be under positive selection. we strived for reduced potential false signals of positive selection introduced during the de novo assembly by selecting transcripts of high abundance  <cit>  and in silico validating each cds in two individuals.

sanger sequencing of five randomly selected genes found no differences between the illumina and the sanger sequenced genes, experimentally verifying the stringent data generation approach. validation of cds is crucial in positive selection analyses, as false signals can arise from sequencing and assembly artifacts and can skew the results and the interpretation of the data  <cit> .

fatty acid metabolism genes are under positive selection in the arctic fox
we found that 1 % of the genes appear to be under positive selection , a value that is comparable to transcriptome studies in other mammals  <cit>  and indicates widespread negative selection or neutrality at protein-coding sequences. genes that are expected to be under positive selection had various important molecular and biological functions  including energy metabolism , cardiac gene regulation , apoptosis  and blood coagulation .

specifically, the branch site test for positive selection identified two genes related with fatty-acid metabolism to be under positive selection in the arctic fox: a) the glycolipid transfer protein domain containing  <dig>   <cit>  and b) v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog  <dig>   <cit> . the akt <dig> is also involved in insulin signaling in adipose cells by binding to vesicles containing glut <dig>   <cit> . insulin plays a central role in the regulation of several metabolic processes, and is involved in glucose uptake into muscle and fat tissue, stimulation of lipogenesis, glycogen and protein synthesis, and inhibition of lipolysis, glycogenolysis and protein breakdown  <cit> . arctic foxes experience seasonal and yearly fluctuations in their body fat composition, and need to respond to starvation periods during winter and react to extremely low temperatures by thermoregulation  <cit> . in addition arctic foxes have high-energy demands during the reproductive season in spring. while red foxes also have to cope with seasonal fluctuations in food availability, this fluctuation is less pronounced  <cit> . hence, genes involved in fatty-acid and glucose metabolism such as glptd <dig> and akt <dig> may play a role in adaptation to strong seasonal fluctuations as experienced by arctic foxes. it is noteworthy that fatty-acid metabolism pathways have been identified to be under positive selection in a recent study on polar and brown bear genomes  <cit> . energy demands and food availability also vary in polar bears and they seem to have similar evolutionary constraints on fat metabolism compared to arctic foxes  <cit> . thus the metabolism of polar bears and arctic foxes appears to be similarly affected by adaptive pressures to a life under arctic conditions and consequently selection pressure affects similar metabolic pathways.

arctic and red foxes diverged during the late pliocene at  <dig>  ma
the three fox transcriptomes yielded a large number of protein-coding genes that could be used for evolutionary studies. about  <dig>  different protein-coding genes were identified by comparisons to the dog genome from each fox individual by pooling cdna from three different tissues. this approach yielded  <dig>  more genes per transcriptome than a previous study, based only on brain tissue  <cit> . thus, relatively complete fox transcriptomes, in this case representing 68 % of the annotated  <dig>  genes of the dog genome, can economically be produced for non-model organisms.

the cds based time estimate for the divergence of the red and arctic fox from a common ancestor at  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  ma is slightly older than a previous estimate based on  <dig> nuclear loci and  <dig> mitochondrial  genes and has a much narrower confidence range  <cit> . the sister species to the arctic fox are the kit  and the swift fox , two desert-adapted species occurring in north america  <cit> , while the red fox is more distantly related. perini et al.  <cit>  reported a divergence time estimate of the arctic and the kit fox of about  <dig>  ma. thus, given the congruence of the divergence time estimates from our phylogenomic analysis and from perini et al.  <cit> , and assuming that the arctic fox diverged from a southern distributed, swift/kit fox-like ancestor  <cit>  the adaptation of the arctic fox to the arctic environment most likely began at around  <dig>  ma. further, the divergence time of the red fox from the corsac fox , a closely related species that is adapted to arid conditions  <cit> , was estimated at about  <dig>  ma  <cit> . both divergences thus occurred in a time frame during which global temperatures declined and fluctuated between warm and cold phases, providing the environmental setting for the evolution of many species pairs with differential ecological adaptations. indeed, divergence time estimates between polar bears and brown bears at about  <dig> - <dig>  ma  <cit>  coincide with the divergence time estimates of the arctic and the red fox from their respective arid-adapted sister species.

the red fox is genetically more variable than the arctic fox
compared to the red fox, fewer heterozygous sites  were found in the transcriptome of the arctic fox, a finding that was verified by sanger sequencing in additional arctic and red fox individuals. this is in agreement with previous studies that have identified a lower level of nucleotide diversity for mt dna of arctic foxes  <cit>  compared to red foxes  <cit> . this is probably a consequence of differences in their distribution ranges and population sizes and of bottlenecks in the arctic fox population during unfavorable climatic periods  <cit> . similar observations have been made in polar bears, which have lower levels of nucleotide diversity for mt dna and nuclear dna than brown bears  <cit> . a lower genetic variation in arctic specialists compared to temperate-zone adapted generalists is expected  <cit>  because during pleistocene warm phases and during the holocene, the distribution ranges of arctic specialists declined, resulting in genetic bottlenecks. although temperate-zone adapted species also suffered from bottlenecks during pleistocene cold phases, generalists like red foxes and brown bears were able to disperse southwards and to quickly re-colonize suitable habitats after deglaciation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome sequencing is an economic strategy to assemble a large number of protein-coding genes in non-model organisms for which genome sequences are not yet available. this first comparative transcriptome study of the arctic and the red fox revealed a number of candidate genes that are possibly involved in adaptations to different climatic conditions. fatty acid metabolism genes are under positive selection in the arctic fox similar to the polar bear and seem generally to be crucial for mammalian survival under arctic conditions. the snps and a large number of microsatellites markers discovered in the fox transcriptome sequences will provide a rich resource to establish new markers for future population genetic studies of nuclear genes that can complement mt dna based studies  <cit> .
