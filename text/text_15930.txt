BACKGROUND
dodonaea viscosa  jacq.  is a dioecious woody shrub with a worldwide distribution across six continents, spanning from 33°n  to 44°s . the species evolved on mainland australia  <cit>  and its wind-dispersed seeds are thought to be capable of traversing long distances over oceans due to their high physical dormancy  <cit> . in a flotation experiment, west showed that 30 % of seeds were still afloat after 100 days, and high germination rates were still found after immersion in seawater for  <dig> months  <cit> . hop bush is very widely distributed across a broad range of ecosystems and exhibits high levels of phenotypic variation. as a result, d. viscosa has been split into seven subspecies, as characterised by jg west  <cit> , based mainly on leaf characteristics and capsule morphology. three of the subspecies, viscosa, burmanniana, and angustifolia, have extra-australian distributions, whereas ssp. angustissima, cuneata, mucronata, and spatulata are all found only within australia.

in australia, d. viscosa is a common species found in a wide range of habitat types, from temperate woodlands to desert gullies and arid shrublands. it has high ecological significance and is widely used in revegetation projects. the high level of phenotypic variation in this species along with its ecological amplitude makes it an ideal species for investigating species divergence and adaptation to local conditions. within south australia, d. viscosa spans a steep rainfall and temperature gradient within the adelaide geosyncline, with ssp. angustissma and ssp. spatulata restricted mostly to the north and south of this region respectively. average annual rainfall varies from 200 mm at the northern extreme of the flinders ranges to 700 mm on kangaroo island in the south, and mean maximum temperature of the warmest month ranges from 23 °c in the south to 36 °c in the north. within this region it has been demonstrated that d. viscosa ssp. angustissima exhibits a cline in leaf width, with narrower leaves at lower latitudes  <cit> . through the use of herbarium specimens dating back 127 years, gr guerin, h wen and aj lowe  <cit>  also showed that average leaf width had decreased over that time period. narrower leaves are an adaptation to hotter, drier climates with broader leaves being more susceptible to extremes in temperature  <cit> . as a result, gr guerin, h wen and aj lowe  <cit>  suggest that this shift in leaf width over space is an adaptation to climate, and temporal shifts in leaf width are a response to historical climate variation. however, with only morphological data from field and herbarium specimens used to demonstrate this correlation, whether the observed patterns are a result of a plastic or a genetic adaptation response to climate is unknown. the genomic data presented here will act as a starting point to addressing these questions.

despite the rapid increase in sequencing capabilities over the last decade, there is currently a lack of genomic data available for this genus. a search on the ncbi nucleotide database with the search term “dodonaea” returned  <dig> results for the genus, with  <dig> for d. viscosa specifically . the vast majority of these data are barcode markers  for phylogenetic studies. in order to identify and investigate potential genes underlying the phenotypic clines demonstrated in this species, genomic resources must first be developed.

for non-model species, rna sequencing  is now regularly utilised as an effective method for generating a reduced representation of a species’ genome, specifically targeting the transcribed portion of the genome . an advantage of transcriptome data, particularly when looking to address questions of adaptation, is that the majority of the transcriptome sequences generated will be from coding regions and therefore of potential functional importance. a major hurdle with the use of this type of data for non-model organisms is that, in the absence of a reference genome, transcript sequences must be assembled de novo. with billions of short reads to work with this is no mean feat, and requires a large amount of computational power along with robust, reliable algorithms. as a result, a suite of de novo assemblers have now been developed for this purpose  <cit> . however, depending on the assembler used, results can vary in terms of number and length of contigs  <cit> . in comparison to assembly against a reference genome, de novo assemblies require higher coverage in order to accurately assemble contigs and, as there is no reference, sequencing errors and the presence of chimeric molecules can have a much greater impact  <cit> . bearing these issues in mind, being stringent on base quality thresholds and only using contigs with highly significant blast hits  to previously published, putatively homologous sequences  will help to ensure high confidence in the resultant assembly. in addition, an approach that makes use of more than one assembler and then compares the resultant assemblies by looking for shared and therefore potentially more robust contig calls derives an assembly of high confidence in the absence of a reference genome  <cit> .

in this study, we characterise the leaf transcriptome of dodonaea viscosa with the aim to identify and functionally annotate a large number of expressed genes as well as identify single nucleotide polymorphisms between populations collected along a latitudinal gradient for development as molecular markers. the outcomes from this study will be used to set the stage for future studies into the population and adaptation genomics of this species, with the developed marker set being utilised to further our understanding of adaptive variation along an environmental gradient. our study presents a valuable resource for on-going research into this ecologically variable and significant species.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly
illumina hiseq sequencing of seven cdna libraries prepared from leaf mrna generated  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads, totalling  <dig>  gb.  <dig> , <dig> reads were from ssp. angustissima and  <dig> , <dig> were from ssp. spatulata. following quality control steps of removal of duplicates and trimming of sequences on length and quality, a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads remained.  <dig>  % of the reads were assembled using clc genomics workbench v.  <dig>  into  <dig>  unique contiguous sequences  of mean length  <dig> bases  with a total of  <dig> ,455 bp. the smallest and largest contigs were  <dig> and  <dig>  nucleotides respectively.  <dig> , <dig> of the reads included in the assembly remained in pairs, whereas  <dig> , <dig> were broken pairs. all reads were then mapped back to the assembly, with  <dig> , <dig> successfully mapping and  <dig> , <dig> not mapping.

of the  <dig> , <dig> cleaned reads, only  <dig>  % were incorporated into contigs in the de novo assembly. the remaining  <dig>  % were therefore not included in any further analysis as, at only 100 bp long, they were too short to be considered on their own. there are a number of possible reasons as to why these sequences were not incorporated into contigs. for example, the presence of short microrna, degradation of rna during the extraction process, sequencing errors, low sequence coverage, contamination from other organisms, the assembly algorithm used , and low level expression of certain transcripts could all lead to sequences being omitted during the assembly  <cit> .

an expanding number of programs exist for the de novo assembly of short-read transcriptome data  <cit> . attempting to assemble a transcriptome from short sequences without a reference genome is not a simple task computationally and, as a result, none of these assemblers claim to be perfect. some of the issues faced are that high levels of coverage are required  thus excluding transcripts with low expression  <cit>  and the assembly process is very sensitive to sequencing errors and chimeric molecules  <cit> . comparisons of assembler performance have shown that assemblies will vary depending on the assembler used in terms of number of contigs generated, length of contigs, and resultant blast success  <cit> . we elected to use the clc de novo assembler as it has performed well in a number of previous illumina-based transcriptome assemblies  <cit>  and is the assembler of choice in  <cit> .

in an attempt to validate the contigs produced using clc the reads were also assembled through the trinity pipeline  <cit> . this generated  <dig>  contigs. following removal of duplicates  <dig>  contigs remained. trinity is very effective at identifying splice variants, however this results in a high proportion of redundancy in the data compared to the clc assembly  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that clc is one of the least redundant assemblers  <cit> . in order to reduce this redundancy in the trinity assembly the longest contig per component or putative gene was selected. this gave a total of  <dig>  contigs, which is comparable in number to the clc total of  <dig> . reciprocal mappings of the two sets of contigs showed there to be  <dig>  % overlap between them. this demonstrates that the two independent assembly algorithms can give highly similar outputs, thus providing more confidence in the resultant set of contigs. all clc contigs were used in the downstream analysis, rather than just those in common with the trinity assembly, so as not to lose any potentially useful information.

sequence annotation
of the  <dig>  clc-generated contigs,  <dig>   had significant alignments  to sequences in the ncbi’s non-redundant database. as has been the case in previous transcriptome assemblies, contig length was a significant predictor of the presence or absence of a significant blast hit   <cit> . mean length of contigs with significant blast hits was 888 bp  and for those without significant blast hits was 421 bp . 58 % of the contigs had no homologous sequences within the nr database. this could be for a number of reasons, such as the presence of untranslated mrna, chimeric sequences resulting from assembly errors, sequences from uncharacterised genes, and sequences from genes unique to d. viscosa.

thirty-eight thousand three hundred eleven  of contigs with significant blast hits had their top hit to a species within the viridiplantae . the remaining  <dig>  % contigs had top blast hits to fungi , arthropoda , bacteria , or viruses . as these were field-collected samples with high risk of contamination from endophytes, parasites, and symbionts it was not surprising that a proportion of contig sequences had significant blast hits to non-plant sequences . taking the contigs with significant blast hits to fungal species, it was interesting to note that the fungal species represented in the data were very similar across all samples. ceriporiopsis subvermispora and the sac fungus baudoinia compniacensis were the most prevalent in all samples, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the contigs identified as fungal blasting to homologous sequences with these species respectively. the microbial communities associated with dodonaea viscosa are largely unknown and these data could provide a starting point for future research into this.fig.  <dig> most recent common ancestors of assembled contigs. output from megan, where the output from blastx searches of assembled contigs against the ncbi nr database was used to assign contigs to a taxonomic node. the size of each circle reflects the number of contigs assigned to each node, with the percentage of assigned contigs indicated in parentheses



all contigs without a significant blast hit to plant sequences were excluded from any further analysis, leaving  <dig>  contigs remaining. within these  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  unique protein accessions were identified from the blast results. the most closely related species to d. viscosa with sequenced genomes are citrus clementina and citrus sinensis, also members of sapindales. the citrus sinensis genome contains an estimated  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> , suggesting that our transcriptome is a good representation of the genes present within d.viscosa. the most frequent blast hit species was vitis vinifera with  <dig>  hits. theobroma cacao had the second most frequent hits, with  <dig> . in terms of the top blast hits with lowest e-values, sequences most closely matched those of theobroma cacao , with vitis vinifera having the second highest number of top hits  . the higher similarity to t. cacao sequences is a reflection of the phylogenetic relatedness of these species to d. viscosa  <cit> .fig.  <dig> top blast hit species. species from the ncbi nr database with the top blast hits  to the assembled contigs. species are listed on the x-axis in rank order according to their total number of top blast hits 



there is currently a lack of genomic information available for dodonaea, as demonstrated by the lack of hits to dodonaea sequences in the blast results. the majority of blast hits were to agriculturally relevant species, such as vitis vinifera, theobroma cacao, and glycine max, that have had a plethora of genomic data generated for them and so hits to these species are much more likely, as found in other plant transcriptome characterisation studies  <cit> .

this study acts as the starting point of exploration into adaptation across environmental gradients in dodonaea viscosa and, as such, we are interested in identifying genes that may be under differential selection among contrasting climatic regimes. in terms of seeking out genes under selection over a latitudinal gradient where rainfall and temperature clines are steep, genes related to water balance and response to drought are obvious candidates. one such group of genes is the aquaporins, which are involved in membrane permeability, are ubiquitous amongst living organisms, and have been the subject of a number of in-depth functional studies in plants  <cit> . within the transcriptome assembly presented here,  <dig> contigs had significant homologies with aquaporin or probable aquaporin genes , potential targets for future genetic adaptation studies. abscisic acid  has also been shown to be involved in water stress responses  <cit>  and aba signal transduction is interconnected with aquaporin function  <cit> . genes involved in aba production and function are therefore also good candidate genes for investigating adaptation to water-related stress.  <dig> such genes had homologous sequences within our assembled transcriptome, five of which had “response to water deprivation” gene ontologies assigned . table  <dig> contigs with significant blast hits to aquaporin genes

gene ontology  annotation was performed on the  <dig>  contigs using the clc blast2gopro plugin. of these contigs,  <dig>   were annotated, with a total of  <dig>  go terms assigned . the number of gos assigned per sequence ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  go terms fit under three broad categories: biological processes , cellular components , and molecular function . the number of assignments per category was as follows: cellular components:  <dig>  gos; biological processes:  <dig>  gos; molecular function:  <dig>  gos . it is interesting to note that, under the biological processes category,  <dig> contigs were assigned go terms relating to ‘response to stimulus’ . of these, a number of go terms assigned relate to a response to an environmental stressor. for example, response to salt stress , response to cold , defence response , response to water deprivation , response to oxidative stress , and response to high light intensity  were all abundantly assigned. polymorphisms in and/or differential expression of these genes between populations along an environmental gradient could be an indication of adaptation to local conditions and so should inform future studies into such adaptation.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  annotation outcome. blast2go was used to attempt to annotate the  <dig>  contigs that had significant blast hits  to plant species. the number of contigs that had no gos assigned , mapping results only , and that were fully annotated are shown

nine hundred two enzyme codes were assigned to  <dig> contig sequences, which were included in  <dig> different kegg pathways . the most highly represented pathways were “purine metabolism”, “starch and sucrose metabolism” and “phenylalanine metabolism” with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> assigned contigs respectively . this mirrors the findings of a recent annotation of the aleppo pine  transcriptome, where  <dig> of their assembled contigs were assigned to the “purine metabolism” pathway and  <dig> contigs were assigned to the “starch and sucrose metabolism” pathway  <cit> . given that our transcripts were from leaf tissue, it is not surprising to find that so many are involved in the metabolism of compounds such as amino acids, starch, and sugars. “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” was also a well-represented pathway, with  <dig> sequences assigned to it. phenylpropanoids, a diverse family of secondary metabolites synthesised from phenylalanine, play vital roles in a wide range of responses to environmental stimuli in plants, such as uv photoprotection, attraction of insect pollinators, and defence against infection and herbivory, as well as being involved in reproduction and the internal regulation of cell physiology and signalling  <cit> . again, as leaf tissue requires protection from uv light and is the main site of herbivory, a high prevalence of gene transcripts involved in phenylpropanoid synthesis is as expected.table  <dig> top  <dig> kegg pathways represented by contig sequences



of the  <dig>  contig sequences,  <dig>  had interpro protein annotations. the most commonly occurring protein region was a pentatricopeptide repeat , with  <dig>  occurrences . ppr is a 35-amino-acid motif, first identified in arabidopsis thaliana, that occurs in tandem arrays  <cit> . proteins containing pprs are particularly prevalent in the plant kingdom and they are mainly involved in organelle gene expression through rna binding, editing  <cit> , splicing, and stability . such a high prevalence of transcripts coding for pprs in the leaf transcriptome of d. viscosa is therefore unsurprising, as a high concentration of chloroplasts would determine the presence of such proteins. other commonly occurring domains and sites identified in our contigs include the highly conserved protein kinase domain , which contains the catalytic function of protein kinases; proteins belonging to the cytochrome p <dig> family , a diverse group of enzymes involved in the oxidation of organic substances; and leucine-rich repeat regions , a repeating stretch of 20– <dig> amino acids that form an α/β horseshoe fold  <cit>  and are involved in the formation of protein-protein interactions  <cit>  .table  <dig> top  <dig> interpro scan annotations



in this study, only leaf tissue was collected for rna extraction. this was for two reasons: 1) leaves in this species demonstrate a morphological cline  <cit>  and so are a tissue of interest when looking to answer questions about adaptation, and 2) it simplified the collection and extraction process. gene activity varies between tissue type as well as varying with the time of day and across seasons. as each tissue type will have a different set of active genes, the transcriptome we have characterised is specific to the leaf tissue in this species. to gain a more holistic view and to include genes that are not transcribed in leaf tissue, other tissue types would also need to be sampled. despite this, a broad variety of genes with diverse functions is represented in our contigs, as demonstrated by the blast results, gene ontology annotation, and kegg analysis.

subspecies comparison
the two subspecies within our sample, d. viscosa ssp. angustissma and ssp. spatulata, are distinguishable morphologically mainly by leaf shape  <cit> . however, this distinction appears not to be absolute and intergrades between forms can be found . their ranges within the study region overlap slightly, with ssp. angustissima restricted mostly to the hotter, drier north and ssp. spatulata in the cooler, wetter south, with the exception of sympatric populations on kangaroo island . the degree of genetic differentiation between the subspecies is unknown. here, we sought to find fixed genomic differences between the transcriptomes of the two subspecies. mapping the ssp. spatulata reads onto a set of consensus ssp. angustissima sequences and then looking for polymorphisms between the reference sequences and the mapped reads resulted in the identification of  <dig> fixed snp differences over  <dig> shared contigs. the transition/transversion ratio of these snps was  <dig> , showing a transition bias. this is as expected in the sense that transitions occur more readily due to the molecular mechanisms underlying them and is comparable to the transition/transversion ratio of  <dig>  found by  <cit>  in their comparison of big sagebrush  subspecies transcriptomes.fig.  <dig> map of dodonaea viscosa sample population locations. the adelaide-geosyncline region with the southern ocean to the south. locations of the four d.viscosa ssp. angustissima and  <dig> ssp. spatulata populations sampled for rna extraction are indicated by star and pentagon symbols respectively



a wide diversity of go terms were assigned to the subset of shared contigs across the broad categories of cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions , suggesting that diversification of the subspecies has occurred over a wide range of genes and for a number of traits. further investigation into fixed differences by, for example, large scale screening for these genes within populations of the two subspecies  using targeted gene sequencing technologies such as hybrid capture may provide an insight into the genes involved in adaptation and possibly the mechanisms involved in reproductive isolation leading to speciation.

variant detection and marker development
all cleaned reads from both subspecies were mapped onto the set of  <dig>  contigs with significant blast hits to viridiplantae gene sequences. of the  <dig> , <dig> reads,  <dig> , <dig>  mapped to the reference sequences.  <dig>  snps were identified across  <dig>  contigs, with a transition/transversion ratio of  <dig> . stringent quality score settings ensured a high average snp quality score of  <dig>  and average coverage per snp was  <dig> .

in the  <dig>  contigs that were input into estscan,  <dig>  coding regions were identified across  <dig>  contigs . after mapping the reads from all populations onto these contigs,  <dig>  snps were identified across  <dig> contigs. of these,  <dig>  snps distributed over  <dig> contigs were identified as non-synonymous. non-synonymous snps result in amino acid changes in the translated polypeptide and, as such, can be targets of selection. therefore, this identified set of  <dig> contigs may be of particular interest in future studies when looking for signatures of selection.

snps are yet to be validated as markers suitable for investigating d. viscosa ecology and adaptation and future work is planned to this end. in this study, only two individuals per population were sampled making it difficult to assess allelic variation between populations. however, previous studies have relied on fewer individuals than this when identifying variants from transcriptome data  <cit> . a more extensive population screening of these potential markers is required, with several individuals per population, in order to measure allele frequencies and fixed differences between populations. a population study using targeted hybrid-capture of the polymorphic loci identified here is in progress in an attempt to uncover signals of selection along an environmental gradient as well as demographic history in this species. beyond this, the resource could be utilised in linkage mapping and gene-based association studies within d. viscosa, as well as for comparative genomics. this transcriptome could also serve as a relevant genetic resource more widely for the currently under-represented dodonaea genus.

CONCLUSIONS
using a single lane of an illumina hiseqtm  <dig> sequencing run we have generated an extensive genomic resource dataset, providing a broad characterisation of expressed genes in the leaves of d. viscosa, as well as identifying a large set of genetic snp markers for future population genetic analysis of this species. our results, along with several other recent studies, indicate that short reads from illumina sequencing can be effectively assembled to provide a characterisation of the transcribed genes within a non-model species  <cit> . the diversity of genes identified through blast searches, gene ontological annotations, kegg pathways, and protein domain screening demonstrates that we have successfully assembled a robust set of transcriptome sequences representing a wide range of genes of functional significance that are expressed within the leaf tissue of d. viscosa. this study provides an extensive genetic resource that can be utilised to delve deep into the ecology and evolution of a species/genus currently lacking in such resources.
