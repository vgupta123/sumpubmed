BACKGROUND
study of a gene product by expressing its constitutively active or dominant negative mutant in a cell is a powerful tool of investigation. however, neutrophils are non-dividing cells with poor survival after isolation. consequently, exogenous gene expression in neutrophils is challenging. researchers have partially overcome these difficulties by performing studies in well-developed cell-free systems  <cit> , with permeabilized neutrophils  <cit>  and with cell lines that undergo some neutrophil functions, such as hl- <dig> cells or b-lymphoblasts  <cit> . others have used virus-based expression systems, but these systems require laborious cloning into specific vectors and the procedures for viral infection are time consuming and potentially hazardous  <cit> . here we report the transfection and expression of genes into neutrophils by nucleofection. using this technology, which delivers the vector directly into the nucleus  <cit> , exogenous genes can be expressed in neutrophils in as short as  <dig> h after transfection, overcoming the difficulties associated with the short lifetime of these cells.

in innate immunity, neutrophils are crucial for the destruction of bacteria and fungi  <cit> . to combat bacterial infection, neutrophils must perform functions that include migration to the inflammatory site, phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and generation of reactive oxygen species  that contribute to killing. the nadph oxidase of neutrophils is a multisubunit enzymatic complex responsible for the monoelectronic reduction of oxygen to produce superoxide anion   <cit> . free radical production is directly related to the bactericidal capacity of these cells since patients with chronic granulomatous disease , whose nadph oxidase is inactive  <cit> , suffer recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. the nadph oxidase comprises the cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox and p40phox, the membrane-associated cytochrome b <dig> and the accessory proteins rac <dig> and rap1a. the cytochrome b <dig>  consisting of the glycoprotein gp91phox and the protein p22phox, localizes in the plasma membrane as well as in the membrane of secretory vesicles, specific and tertiary granules. in resting neutrophils, the oxidase remains unassembled and, therefore, inactive. in response to adequate stimuli, the cytosolic factor p47phox is phosphorylated at serine residues located at its carboxy terminus, then the phox homology  domain located in its amino terminus is unmasked  <cit>  and p47phox, together with p67phox, translocates to the membrane-associated cytochrome b <dig>  this switches the nadph oxidase to its active form  <cit> . the activation of the nadph oxidase by a soluble stimulus like the formylated peptide n-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine  involves both early trafficking of the cytochrome b <dig> to the plasma membrane through degranulation and the subsequent translocation of the cytosolic factors to assemble the oxidase. the exposure of neutrophils to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  stimulates a larger degree of degranulation than that observed in response to fmlp and induces the assembly of the nadph oxidase not only at the plasma membrane but also at the membrane of the intracellular vesicles/granules  <cit> . if neutrophils are exposed to particulate stimulus like opsonized microorganisms, phagocytosis takes place, and specific and azurophilic granules fuse with the phagosome to integrate the cytochrome b <dig> with the phagosomal membrane  <cit>  and to release their contents into the phagolysosome  <cit> . in all cases, the activation of the nadph oxidase requires the interaction of p47phox and p22phox, which is mediated by the sh <dig> domains located in the carboxy terminus of p47phox  <cit> . recent studies suggested that the px domain of p47phox, a phosphoinositide-binding module  <cit> , plays an important role in the translocation of p47phox towards biological membranes  <cit> . we show that the px domain of p47phox does not translocate to the membranes of mature phagosomes during phagocytosis of opsonized-zymosan particles.

RESULTS
transfection efficiency and cellular viability
to optimize the transfection of human neutrophils, we used the β-galactosidase expression vector pcmv-βgal, previously described  <cit> . after transfection, cells were incubated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours at 37°c and at the appropriate times were centrifuged, washed twice with pbs and lysed by sonication in 2% nonidet p- <dig>  β-galactosidase activity was then measured using the β-gal reporter gene assay kit . maximum galactosidase activity was observed at  <dig> h after gene transfer when using the proprietary transfection solution ''t''  and an electrical setting corresponding to program t <dig> . the transfection efficiency under these experimental conditions was  <dig>  to 1%. the viability of neutrophils after the electrical pulse and after the 2-hour recovery period was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively, evaluated using trypan blue exclusion. next, we compared the efficiency of transfection of human neutrophils under various electrical settings corresponding to a series of second generation programs for amaxa nucleofectors. in figure 1b, we show that the electrical settings corresponding to programs u <dig> and y <dig> resulted in higher transfection efficiency for similar experimental conditions based on flow cytometric analysis of neutrophils transfected with the vector pmaxgfp. also in figure 1b, we show that the second generation programs  better preserve cell viability when evaluated by propidium iodide. for consistency and since the initial experiments were performed using program t <dig>  this electrical setting was employed in subsequent experiments unless stated otherwise. importantly, no differences in the subcellular distribution of the fluorescent chimeras were observed when using program y <dig> instead of t <dig>  next, we used confocal microscopy to examine the transfection and expression of enhanced green fluorescent proteins encoded by the pegfp  expression vector  in neutrophils. to demonstrate further that the population of transfected neutrophils was fully functional, we transfected neutrophils with the nadph oxidase cytosolic factor p47phox as an egfp chimera, and we stimulated cells with phorbol ester or with the formylated peptide fmlp which mimics bacteria-derived peptides and stimulates neutrophils through binding to the membrane receptor formyl peptide receptor  <dig>   <cit> . in figure  <dig>  we show that transfected neutrophils stimulated with pma or fmlp can undergo morphological changes represented by the appearance of protrusions of the plasma membrane, presumably membrane ruffles. these membrane structures were enriched in egfp-p47phox , which is in agreement with previous reports describing the localization of nadph oxidase factors at membrane ruffles after activation in non-primary cell lines  <cit> . the distribution pattern for egfp was different from that of egfp-p47phox. egfp was detected in the nucleus and cytosol, and was also detected in membrane protrusions in stimulated cells .

to evaluate the effect of nucleofection on nadph oxidase activation, we first analyzed the ability of nucleoporated neutrophils to produce ros using the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence detection system. in figure 3a, we show that electroporated cells have relatively low basal luminol-dependent chemiluminescence activity in the absence of stimuli. importantly, they maintain their capacity to respond to stimuli. nucleoporated neutrophils show ros production kinetics similar to that of non-electroporated cells in response to pma . furthermore, electroporated neutrophils expressing an exogenous protein respond to stimulus . the response was detected using the nitroblue tetrazolium reaction. formazan, the blue-black precipitate generated by superoxide anion-dependent nbt reduction, was evident in stimulated cells but undetectable in unstimulated, transfected cells . these results suggest that electroporated neutrophils conserve an intact nadph oxidase. to further support this idea, we transfected neutrophils with a vector expressing wild type p47phox downstream of egfp and then stimulated the cells with pma. the translocation of p47phox to the plasma membrane was followed in real time by confocal microscopy analysis . the results indicate that egfp-p47phox, but not the egfp control, undergoes translocation during activation further supporting the idea that electroporated neutrophils are functional and responsive.

to evaluate whether nucleofection induces more subtle degrees of activation in neutrophils, we examined the surface expression of cd11b, a human leukocyte integrin subunit that is mainly present in the membrane of secretory vesicles and tertiary granules in resting neutrophils. in figure  <dig>  we show that nucleoporated neutrophils have, in fact, a marked increase in cd11b molecules on their cellular surface. the level of cd11b at the plasma membrane after nucleoporation was even larger than that triggered by fmlp stimulation. the increase in the surface expression of cd11b was evident using either program t <dig> or the second generation program y <dig> . in some experiments, two populations of cells were identified according to their level of surface expression of cd11b after nucleoporation . cells expressing gfp were mainly distributed with the subpopulation of cells showing higher surface expression of cd11b . these results suggest that nucleofection induces the mobilization of secretory vesicles and, probably, tertiary granules, which are the subpopulation of neutrophil secretory organelles with the highest tendency to undergo exocytosis.

the px domain of p47phox does not translocate to the phagosomal membrane in human neutrophils
the cytosolic factors p47phox and p40phox each contain a px domain at their amino terminus  <cit> . px domains are also present in proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling including vam7p  <cit>  and pi3k-c <dig>  <cit> , respectively. px domains are phosphoinositide binding modules  <cit> . the affinity of the various px domains for several phosphoinositides differs from protein to protein. in particular, the px domain of p47phox has been shown to bind preferentially to pip, pip <dig>  <cit> , and pip <dig>  <cit> . the mechanism mediated by the px domain of p47phox in the activation of the oxidase is controversial. one group has suggested that the phosphoinositide-binding activity of the p47phox px domain is essential for the membrane translocation of this protein and activation of the phagocyte nadph oxidase  <cit> . other groups have indicated that the translocation of the p47phox px domain to the plasma membrane is not due to interactions with phospholipids but to association with the actin cytoskeleton  <cit>  and have shown in a variety of cell lines that the px domain of p47phox targets to cell membranes via interaction with moesin  <cit> . furthermore, while some researchers propose that a single residue substitution in the px domain of p47phox decreases its affinity to phosphoinositides and its binding to cell membranes in resting or pma-stimulated cells  <cit> , others show that the px domain of p47phox translocates to the plasma membrane after activation in a phosphoinositide-independent manner in cos cells  <cit> . the subcellular localization of the px domain of p47phox in human neutrophils has not yet been shown. to analyze this, we transfected human neutrophils with a vector for the expression of a chimera composed of egfp upstream of the p47phox px-domain . the visualization of the subcellular distribution of the px domain is somewhat difficult due to the relatively small size of these cells. however, the fluorescence intensity plots helped to identify an increase in the distribution of fluorescence towards the edge of the cells. we concluded that the p47phox px domain partially localizes at the plasma membrane in nucleoporated neutrophils. localization of egfp-p47-px in intracellular structures was also evident, a phenomenon previously described in cos cells  <cit> . differently from the fusion protein egfp-p47phox which required phorbol ester-mediated neutrophil activation for plasma membrane localization , the subcellular distribution of egfp-p47-px was not markedly affected by cellular stimulation . although the concentrations of pip <dig>  <cit> , and pip <dig> in resting neutrophils are considered to be relatively low  <cit> , it could be possible that pi3-kinases undergo some level of activation during nucleoporation thus increasing the membrane distribution of the px domain in unstimulated cells. however, pretreatment of neutrophils with the pi3-kinase inhibitor ly <dig> did not alter the pattern of protein distribution in egfp-p47-px transfected neutrophils or prevent the increase in the surface expression of cd11b after nucleoporation . another possibility is that once exposed , the px domain could recognize pre-existent structures at the plasma membrane, possibly moesin, pip  <cit> , phosphatidic acid  <cit>  or even basal levels of pi 3-kinase products. from our experiments, it seems that the plasma membrane of nucleoporated neutrophils has the necessary molecular machinery to sequester, at least in part, the p47phox px-domain. the molecular basis of this mechanism remains to be clarified.

during particle engulfment, the nadph oxidase complex is assembled at the membrane of the phagosome so that superoxide anion is pumped into the core of the phagosome where the engulfed microorganism is killed. in particular, p47phox has been shown to localize towards nascent and mature phagosomes in neutrophils after phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles  <cit> . this poses the question of whether the px domain of p47phox, which has been proposed to mediate the translocation of p47phox towards the cytochrome b558-containing plasma membrane and to participate in the activation of the nadph oxidase in cells stimulated with soluble stimuli  <cit> , could also be implicated in the assembly of the oxidase at the phagosome membrane. in an attempt to clarify this, we analyzed the distribution of the px domain of p47phox during phagocytosis. we transfected neutrophils with the expression vector pegfp-p47-px or with cdna encoding a chimera of egfp and rhob, a small gtpase thought to function in the regulation of endocytosis  <cit>  and phagocytosis  <cit> . then, we exposed the transfected cells to texas red-conjugated opsonized zymosan a particles, and protein distribution during phagocytosis was evaluated by confocal microscopy. in figure  <dig>  we show that neutrophils expressing egfp-rhob or egfp-p47-px can undergo phagocytosis. from those experiments, it becomes clear that nucleoporated neutrophils conserve their ability to phagocytose opsonized particles. the accumulation of green fluorescence around the phagosome is evident in egfp-rhob-expressing neutrophils but was not observed in cells expressing egfp-p47-px . similar results were observed in hl- <dig> promyelocytic cells when differentiated to granulocytes . these data suggest that the mechanisms of translocation of p47phox to the plasma membrane and to the phagosome membrane are different. it is likely that the translocation of p47phox to the phagosome does not involve the px domain. one possibility is that the sh <dig> domains of p47phox, which have been largely shown to bind to the membrane-localized cytochrome b <dig> through interaction with the cytosolic domain of p22phox, are sufficient to translocate p47phox to the phagosome. however, p47phox was clearly detected in forming phagosomes in x-linked cgd neutrophils which lack cytochrome b <dig>  indicating that the recruitment of this protein to the nascent phagosome is independent of cytochrome b <dig>  <cit> . in the same work, p47phox was undetectable in phagosome membranes of mature phagosomes in neutrophils from x-linked cgd patients  <cit> , suggesting that p47phox can not be retained at the phagosome in the absence of cytochrome b <dig>  likewise, the px domain of p47phox localizes at the plasma membrane in the proximity of the opsonized particle in the nascent phagosome , but is not retained in the membrane of mature phagosomes  despite the fact that moesin, the actin-binding protein shown to bind to the px domain of p47phox, is present in phagosome membranes  <cit> . therefore, the reason why the px domain of p47phox is not retained in the mature phagosome may reside in the differential role that the products of class i and class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase play during phagosome formation and maturation  <cit> . the product of class i pi 3-kinase, pip <dig>  has been shown to be rapidly synthesized during phagosomal formation  <cit> , but the accumulation was sharply restricted to the phagosomal cup  <cit> . conversely, pip, a product of class iii pi 3-kinase, was only detected in sealed phagosomes  <cit> . these data correlate with our observation that the pip3-binding domain of p47phox  is present in membranes in the forming phagosome but is absent from the membrane of the mature phagosome. although not explored here, it is also possible that the pip-binding domain of p40phox  is implicated in maintaining the cytosolic complex of the nadph oxidase at the mature phagosome.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that cdna transfer and expression of exogenous protein in human neutrophils is compatible with cell viability and is no longer a limitation on the study of neutrophil function; however, the relatively low efficiency of transfection/expression observed after  <dig> h restricts the subsequent analysis to experiments that use single cells. since phagocytosis of opsonized particles by neutrophils as well as their response to stimuli requires intact downstream signaling machinery, the results presented here suggest that transfected neutrophils are viable and fully functional. using this methodology, we showed that the px domain of p47phox is translocated to the plasma membrane but is not retained at the membrane of mature phagosomes suggesting that distinct mechanisms may operate during the activation of the nadph oxidase at different subcellular sites in human neutrophils.
