BACKGROUND
plants have evolved a sophisticated, multi-layered defence network to detect and respond to pathogen challenges. inducible responses are governed by plasma membrane pattern recognition receptors  and also cytoplasmic immune receptors encoded by resistance  genes. prrs recognise relatively conserved small molecules, proteins and protein fragments, produced externally to the cell by invading pathogens, and collectively referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns . by contrast, r proteins directly or indirectly perceive proteins and small molecules termed effectors that are introduced into plant cells by the pathogen. genes encoding effectors that are recognised by r gene products, leading to effective plant resistance, are genetically defined as avirulence  genes. two modes of resistance may be distinguished: pamp triggered immunity  that is mediated by prrs, and effector triggered immunity  that results from effector recognition by r proteins and often produces a hypersensitive response, a form of localised host programmed cell death  <cit> . r genes have been implicated in resistances against diverse and taxonomically unrelated pathogens including bacteria, viruses, nematodes, insects, filamentous fungi and oomycetes. in addition to being pivotal for host resistance, prrs and r genes are thought to play a role in non-host resistance  <cit> .

the majority of cloned and functional r genes described within the plant kingdom contain a nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeat  domain, and are members of the stand  protein family of ntpases, known as nb-lrrs  <cit> . the nucleotide binding site forms part of a larger complex known as nb-arc, which reflects its presence in the human apoptotic protease-activating factor- <dig> , plant r proteins and caenorhabditis elegans death- <dig> protein   <cit> . further subdomains and multiple conserved motifs have been identified within the nb-arc domain  <cit> .

based on the presence or absence of n-terminal domains, members of the nb-lrr family can be divided into two major groups. the first group contains an n-terminal domain with homology to the drosophila toll and human interleukin- <dig> receptor  and is referred to as tir-nb-lrrs or tnls. the second, non-tir-nb-lrr, group is collectively known as cnls as some, but not all, members of this group contain a predicted coiled-coil  structure in the n-terminus. this division of nb-lrr proteins is also reflected in phylogenetic analyses of the nb-arc domains in which tnl and cnl proteins form distinct clades  <cit> .

nb-lrr genes comprise one of the largest gene families in plants. approximately  <dig> nb-lrr encoding genes have been identified in the genome of arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> within arabidopsis lyrata  <cit> ,  <dig> within brassica rapa  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> in the genomes of the woody species poplar and grapevine respectively  <cit> , and  <dig> and  <dig> in two genomes of oryza sativa  <cit> . in addition, partial nb-lrrs that lack some nb-lrr specific domains and contain, for example, only tir, tir-nb, cc, and cc-nb domains, have been described in plant genomes  <cit> . nb-lrr genes are ancient in their origin and have been identified in ancestors of early land plants. nb genes with sequence homology to tnls have been described in bryophytes  <cit>  and tnls and cnls have been found in gymnosperms and eudicots  <cit> . however, the composition of nb-lrr genes varies significantly between species  <cit> . the unequal representation of nb-lrr lineages within plant taxa has been typified by the low frequency of tnls within the monocotyledonous species despite the manifestation of tnls prior to the angiosperm-gymnosperm split  <cit> .

within genomes, nb-lrr genes are organized either as isolated genes, or as linked clusters of varying size that are thought to facilitate rapid r gene evolution  <cit> . nb-lrr gene clusters are termed homogeneous when they contain only sequences that share a recent common ancestor. in contrast, clusters that contain more distantly-related nb-lrrs are referred to as heterogeneous  <cit> .

potato is the most important non-cereal food crop, with worldwide production yielding approximately  <dig> million tonnes in  <dig> . like all plants, potato faces a constant barrage of pest and microbial threats. more than  <dig> functional nb-lrr genes have been cloned from potato and related members of the solanaceae  <cit>  and  <dig> nb-lrr-like sequences have previously been identified in a bac library prepared from a heterozygous diploid potato clone, rh  <cit> . the genome sequence of a doubled monoploid solanum tuberosum group phureja clone, dm1- <dig>  <dig> r <dig> , has recently been described  <cit> . among the  <dig>  annotated protein coding genes,  <dig> nb-lrr coding genes were predicted. in this study we used a process of iterated computational and manual annotation to further identify potential nb-lrr coding sequences, determine their locations on the  <dig> potato chromosomes and study the phylogenetic and positional relationships between the individual genes. our results provide significant insight into the evolution of nb-lrrs and, importantly, a blueprint for future efforts to identify and more rapidly clone functional nb-lrr genes from solanum species.

RESULTS
identification of nb-lrr genes within the dm genome protein models
meme  <cit>  was used in conjunction with a positive sequence set of  <dig> characterised nb-lrr protein sequences from diverse plant species and a negative sequence set containing diverse nucleotide binding protein and prr sequences  to identify  <dig> sequence motifs putatively characteristic of nb-lrr proteins. some of the disclosed motifs  are associated with known domains from the tnl and cnl superfamilies, and  <dig> encompass previously described features of the nb-lrr family, such as the p-loop, rnbs-a non-tir, rnbs-b, rnbs-c, rnbs-d, glpl, lrr-motif  <dig> , mhdv, tir- <dig>  tir- <dig>  tir- <dig>  <cit> , edvid  <cit> , and kin- <dig>  <cit>  domains.

amotifs are listed according to their ranking derived from the psp-gen meme analysis. bconsensus amino acid sequence derived from psp-gen meme analysis. references for known motifs encompassed in the meme motifs are shown.

the  <dig> potentially characteristic motifs were used as queries in a mast  <cit>  search against a combination of the annotated potato genome v <dig>  dm protein models  and the training set sequences used to derive the motifs. in total,  <dig> dmps were identified as possessing the motifs identified by meme, with an e-value of less than  <dig> . the positive and negative training set sequences could be distinguished with 100% specificity on the basis of reported e-values. in total  <dig> dmp sequences had reported e-values less than the highest seen for a member of the positive training set . a further  <dig> dmp sequences had e-values less than the smallest e-value observed for a member of the negative training set . thus, a total of  <dig> candidate nb-lrr dmp sequences were identified on the basis of motif composition.

manual re-annotation of dm gene models containing nb-lrr-like sequences
manual inspection of the remaining  <dig> dmps whose e-values lay above the  <dig> e- <dig> cut-off indicated that several sequences contained motif patterns potentially characteristic of nb-lrr proteins, but that were truncated or otherwise distorted. of these,  <dig> sequences that contained at least two tir/cc-specific motifs, or three nb-arc specific motifs, were noted as potential errors in automated gene calling or annotation and carried forward into the candidate set pending a manual check, to give a total of  <dig> putative nb-lrr dmp sequences.

several of the candidate dmp sequences derived from the same dm gene model  sequence as alternative transcripts. we found that  <dig> distinct dmg sequences coded for the  <dig> candidate nb-lrr sequences. the mast search was repeated against conceptual translations of these  <dig> dmgs, and indicated that  <dig> dmg translations apparently lacked domains characteristically associated with tnl or cnl genes. to investigate if misannotation might be responsible for these absences, these dmg sequences were extended by  <dig> kb at both the 5' and 3' ends to generate a counterpart dmg+ sequence set. the mast search was repeated against the conceptual translations of the dmg+ sequences. we found that all  <dig> dmg sequences that initially lacked typical nb-lrr domains contained additional meme motifs in an order characteristic of the other candidate nb-lrr sequences.

gene models corresponding to the dmg+ sequences were modified to incorporate the additional characteristic motifs identified above. conceptual translations of these genes , were compared to nb-lrr proteins in the nr database at ncbi using blastp  <cit>  to identify potential introns and start and stop codons. in addition, six dmg+ models appeared to encode two complete nb-lrr-like sequences, so were split into a total of twelve distinct gene models. a further  <dig> nb-lrr-like sequences appeared to have been split across two adjacent dmgs in the initial annotation. thus, the number of identified nb-lrr-like sequences after manual correction was  <dig>  a further mast search was carried out on these sequences, from which  <dig> dmg sequences were found to have an e-value less than that for any member of the negative sequence set . re-annotated coding sequences and the conceptual translations are supplied in additional file  <dig> 

in total,  <dig> of the predicted nb-lrr sequences are encoded by a single reading frame without introns. a further  <dig> predicted nb-lrrs contain a single intron and/or a frameshift, and  <dig> genes contain two introns and/or frameshifts. the remaining  <dig> genes have between three and eight introns and/or frameshifts. without further detailed analysis , it is difficult to determine if the predicted introns and/or frameshifts are genuine or a result of sequencing/assembly errors. however, of the  <dig> candidate nb-lrr genes without an intron,  <dig> contain all domains associated with tnls or cnls and are thus referred to as 'full length'. a further  <dig> genes that contain one or two potential introns but no frameshift are also classified as 'full length' on the same grounds. among the other dmg+ sequences,  <dig> contain all domains associated with tnls or cnls, and are labelled as 'potentially full length'. the remaining  <dig> genes are classified as 'partial', as they show truncations within the n-terminal domains and/or absence of lrr domains. the average length of the coding sequence for partial genes is  <dig> kb, for full length and potentially full length genes  <dig> kb, and for all identified nb-lrr genes combined  <dig>  kb.

based on the presence of the tir domain derived motifs ,  <dig> genes were identified as tnls. this data was verified using a pfam  <cit>  search over all sequences. all  <dig> full length and potentially full length tnls share the tnl discriminating aspartic acid  in the final position of the kin- <dig> domain  <cit> . the  <dig>  full length non-tir sequences encode for a tryptophan  in this position, and contain the cnl specific motifs  <dig> and/or  <dig>  this analysis was further corroborated by the presence of the cnl-type nb-arc motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  that encapsulate rnbs-d and rnbs-a, described by meyers et al.   <cit> . a paircoil <dig> analysis  <cit>  was carried out on the positive training set  to establish the conditions for coiled-coil domain predictions in well annotated genes. the highest minimum p-score for a functional cc-nb-lrr gene was found for rpi-vnt <dig>  <cit>  with  <dig>  starting at amino acid position  <dig>  the latest start position of a cc domain was determined for r <dig> and rpi-blb <dig> at amino acid position  <dig> . to determine the presence of cc motifs within the  <dig> predicted nb-lrrs, a p-score cut-off of  <dig>  was used for domains starting within the first  <dig> amino acids. under these conditions,  <dig> nb-lrr genes were identified that contain a predicted cc domain. a total of  <dig> cnl genes do not contain a predicted cc domain. the tnl and cnl prediction counts are summarised in table  <dig> and compared to the initial analysis from the pgsc  <cit> . amongst the predicted tnls and cnls, homologues of the functionally characterised solanaceae r genes gpa <dig>  nrc <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  rpi-bt <dig>  rpi-blb <dig>  rpi-blb <dig>  rpi-vnt <dig>  and rx were identified with more than 80% sequence identity using blastp. further homologues of other functionally described solanaceae r genes were identified, albeit with lower percentage sequence identity .

partial genes  and  full length genes  are shown.

phylogenetic analysis
to study the evolutionary relationships among the predicted nb-lrr genes, a phylogenetic tree was estimated from the protein alignment of the conserved nb-arc domains. predicted nb-lrr genes containing ambiguous nucleotides in the nb-arc domain were removed prior to the alignment. in addition to  <dig> predicted tnls and cnls,  <dig> functional nb-lrr genes from the positive training set were also included in the analysis. as expected , the phylogenetic analysis separates the tnl and cnl gene products into two distinct clades and confirms thus our tir motif prediction above . the tnl clade contains  <dig> nb-lrr sequences of which  <dig> are partial, missing motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  and can be divided into six small subgroups. physical mapping of these  indicates that members of five subgroups are distributed over several chromosomes . only members of one subgroup reside predominantly  in a nb-lrr gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> .

only a single dmg product, pgsc0003dmg <dig> , could not reliably be placed in either of the cnl or tnl clades. the encoded gene product shows high sequence similarity  to the atypical arabidopsis/potato adr <dig> cc-nb-lrr protein  <cit> . bootstrap support is given that further divides the cnl clade into ccrpw8-type sequences   <cit> , and the canonical cnl proteins, that, with the exception of dmgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  contain the edvid motif  which is typically associated with cnls  <cit> . the cnl branch contains eight highly conserved subgroups  amongst more diverse sequences and subgroups. cnl- <dig> contains  <dig> genes that map, with one exception, to chromosome  <dig>  members of this subgroup are homologous to the functional resistance to phytophthora infestans  genes rpi-blb <dig>  <cit>  and mi- <dig>  <cit> . cnl- <dig> members show sequence similarity to the functionally validated genes gpa <dig> and rx  <cit> . apart from one gene for which the physical position could not be retrieved from the assembly, the remaining  <dig> members reside on chromosome  <dig>  the subgroup cnl- <dig> contains  <dig> members, of which four remain unmapped. there is a single gene from this subgroup located on each of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and ten genes on chromosome  <dig>  members of the smallest subgroup cnl- <dig> are homologous to rpi-vnt <dig>  <cit>  and tm- <dig>  <cit> . the eight mapped members reside on chromosome  <dig> and one gene remains unmapped. the largest subgroup, cnl- <dig>  contains  <dig> genes of which six remain unmapped and  <dig> reside on chromosome  <dig>  functionally validated r genes with sequence similarity to this subgroup include r <dig> and rpi-blb <dig>  <cit> . half of the  <dig> members of cnl- <dig> map to chromosome  <dig>  one each to chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and the remaining nine are unmapped. the rpi-blb1/rb  <cit>  and rpi-bt <dig>  <cit>  genes share sequence similarity with this group. of the  <dig> sequences in cnl- <dig>   <dig> are localised on chromosome  <dig>  one on chromosome  <dig> and six did not map to any of the chromosomes in this assembly. the cnl- <dig> subgroup contains  <dig> sequences. the physical mapping of these genes has placed  <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and the remaining two on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the functionally validated potato and tomato r genes r3a  <cit> , r3b  <cit>  and i <dig>  <cit>  share sequence similarity with members of this group.

nb-lrr gene mapping and physical clustering
physical map positions for predicted nb-lrr genes were established for  <dig>  of the annotated nb-lrr genes, using anchored superscaffold positions in the pseudomolecules described in the publicly available potato genome annotation v3_ <dig> . <dig>  and visualised using biopython  <cit>  . cnls are present on all  <dig> chromosomes whilst tnls are absent from chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . the greatest number of nb-lrrs is found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  harbouring  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. chromosome  <dig> contains the smallest number of nb-lrr genes  . from the map positions, nb-lrr gene clusters were determined by a combination of two previously described approaches  <cit> . to form a cluster, the distance between neighbouring nb-lrrs was required to be less than  <dig> kb, and for there to be fewer than eight non-nb-lrr genes between tnls or cnls. this approach identifies  <dig> clusters containing a total of  <dig> nb-lrrs . thus 27% of the mapped nb-lrr genes appear not to be organised in physical clusters. of the  <dig> clusters,  <dig>  are homogeneous in that they contain only predicted nb-lrrs with a recent common ancestor, whereas the remaining clusters are heterogeneous, as they contain more distantly-related nb-lrrs.

chromosome  <dig> contains the greatest number of nb-lrr genes  and also the largest number of clusters . with the exception of cluster c <dig>  which contains five homologues of the r gene hero and one tnl, all remaining clusters on this chromosome are homogeneous clusters. the sizes of the clusters vary between two and  <dig> nb-lrr genes . eleven genes on chromosome  <dig> are not organised in clusters. the physically expanded and well described r <dig> and rpi-blb <dig> locus  <cit>  is located on this chromosome and its dm homologues are organised in the phylogenetic subgroup cnl- <dig> which spans four physical clusters . eighteen members form the homogeneous cluster c <dig>  which is also the largest of all. the remaining members of cnl- <dig> are found in cluster c <dig>  and two more are grouped  downstream of the bulk of the clusters.

the heterogeneous r <dig> locus that contains the rpi genes r3a  <cit>  and r3b  <cit>  resides on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  as mentioned, dm homologues of r3a and r3b form the phylogenetic subgroup cnl- <dig>  of the  <dig> members in this subgroup,  <dig> map to chromosome  <dig>  r3a homologues are organised in three neighbouring homogeneous clusters: c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> that contain two, seven and four members respectively. two additional single r3a homologues are located upstream of c <dig>  r3b homologues are organised in cluster c <dig> which harbours nine members .

previous studies have shown that the r <dig> resistance gene locus resides on chromosome  <dig> and is flanked by bs4- and prf-like r genes  <cit> . this structure has been maintained in dm. four adjacent clusters  contain two tnls with homology to bs <dig> , five r <dig> homologues in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and two prf homologues in cluster  <dig>  two bs <dig> homologues in cluster  <dig> , lie approximately  <dig> kb upstream of c <dig> 

the long arm of chromosome  <dig> features two large heterogeneous clusters. cluster  <dig> harbours eight tnls that are separated by eight homologues of rpi-vnt <dig>  <cit>  and tm- <dig>  <cit> . the more distal cluster c <dig> contains  <dig> homologues of the tospovirus resistance gene sw- <dig>  <cit>  .

genomic organisation of nb-lrr genes
gene and repeat densities were calculated and visualised for mapped gene features of the dm genome using a window size of  <dig> kb centred on each gene in the corresponding superscaffolds. dmgs for which the  <dig> kb window would extend beyond a superscaffold were omitted from the analysis. figure  <dig> indicates contours for a gaussian mixture model  with two components that was fitted to the gene/repeat density data. the bulk gene/repeat density is modelled as two overlapping populations that are better distinguished in terms of gene density than repeat density. this is consistent with the potato genome analysis described by xu et al.   <cit> , indicating that there are relatively 'gene-rich' and 'gene-poor' regions within the dm genome. the gmm is overlaid in each case with a scatterplot showing data for predicted nb-lrr genes that were suitably placed for analysis within the superscaffolds. the majority of nb-lrrs lie within the contours of the gmm, consistent with the distribution of nb-lrrs being similar to that of all other genes in the potato genome. only sixteen genes are visually distinguished as lying outside the contours of the gmm and mainly located in relatively repeat-rich regions. this number is within the statistical expectancy of sampling error. it is however interesting to note, that eight of these genes are members of phylogenetic subgroup cnl-1: dmg  <dig> from cluster  <dig> and dmgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which are adjacent to one another in cluster  <dig>  phylogenetically, members of the subgroup cnl- <dig> are most similar to the p. infestans resistance gene rpi-blb <dig> and the nematode and aphid resistance gene mi- <dig> . four further cnls that are located in more repeat-rich regions are dmgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and all of them grouped together in the heterogeneous cluster c <dig> on chromosome  <dig> whereas dmg  <dig> is a single nb-lrr gene on chromosome  <dig> 

discussion
we used an iterative process of manual and computational analysis to identify  <dig> nb-lrr-encoding sequences within the recently published doubled monoploid potato genome  <cit> . this study has revealed a slightly higher number of cnls and tnls compared to the  <dig> nb-lrrs described by xu et al.   <cit> . the difference, which is within the expected sampling error, includes  <dig> additional tnl genes and  <dig> additional cnls. by extending the dm gene models by  <dig> kb at the 3' and 5' end respectively to produce the dmg+ sequences, more domains associated with nb-lrr type genes were identified and the gene annotations correspondingly extended. the number of annotated partial nb-arc only genes fell in our predictions from  <dig> to  <dig> . whilst our analysis used nb-lrr discriminative meme motifs derived from a training set harbouring functionally characterised nb-lrrs from the wider plant kingdom, the analysis described by xu et al.   <cit>  is based on nb-derived pfam domain searches, followed by the construction of a potato-specific nb hidden markov model. both approaches yielded very similar numbers of nb-lrrs. unfortunately, a direct comparison between the different resistance gene homologues  was not possible as the identities of the cnl and tnl genes predicted by xu et al.   <cit>  were not made publicly available.

the meme motif and phylogenetic analysis revealed a distinction between cnls and tnls in the n-terminal region, and in the nb-arc domain of these sequences. seven of the  <dig> identified meme motifs  distinguished between these nb-lrr subclasses, or between the canonical and rpw8-type cnls  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis, which was performed on the conserved nb-arc domain, supported this distinction and was consistent with previous observations for other plant species  <cit> .

the dm potato genome harbours  <dig>  times more cnl than tnl genes. a similar distribution was found for the nb-lrr genes of grapevine , but the ratio is smaller in poplar   <cit> . in comparison, the nb-lrrs of the brassicaceae a. thaliana, a. lyrata and b. rapa contain cnls and tnls in a 1: <dig> ratio  <cit> . the genome of the monocot rice contains only cnls; all other grasses analysed so far contain no or only very few tnls  <cit> . leister  suggested that overrepresentation of tnl over cnl genes in the brassicaceae arabidopsis and rape seed could reflect the adaptation of the r gene set to the predominant pathogens. it can be speculated that the over-representation of cnls in potato is a response to some of the most damaging pathogens such as p. infestans, which is typically controlled by cnls. in line with this, it is interesting to note that 27% of the identified nb-lrr genes share high sequence similarity to functionally characterised rpi genes .

the proportion of all genes that are predicted to encode nb-lrrs is  <dig> %, which is in line with estimates for other plant species that range between  <dig> - <dig> %  <cit> . the gene density around potato nb-lrr loci is approximately  <dig> genes per megabase. however, unlike rxlr effectors from p. infestans which often reside in gene sparse regions  <cit> , a global analysis of the dm nb-lrr genes  shows that cnls and tnls reside in genomic regions that are not significantly different to the potato genome in general in terms of gene or repeat density.

the cnl branch forms two phylogenetic clades, containing the canonical cnls and the cnl-r , as previously described  <cit> . within the canonical cnls, eight major subgroups with high support and short branch length were identified, suggesting a recent common ancestor. two-thirds  of the functional cnl genes included in the tree are found in these subgroups. only members of cnl- <dig> and cnl- <dig>  show no significant sequence similarity to a functionally characterised r gene thus far. their role, which is hitherto unknown, could for example be to provide resistance to yet unknown pathogens and/or to mediate non-host resistance responses  <cit> .

several approaches for the identification of nb-lrr clusters have been described elsewhere, and we have utilised a combination of the analyses described by  <cit>  and  <cit> . the identified members and the overall number of predicted clusters were very similar for both types of analyses, suggesting that the identification of clusters by these methods is relatively robust. however, cluster prediction based on the distances between nb-lrrs does not take into account the variability of gene density in the potato genome  <cit> . similarly, the definition of a gene cluster solely based on the number of non-nb-lrr genes between cnls and tnls fails to take any physical distance into account. predicted potato nb-lrr genes are unevenly distributed over the  <dig> chromosomes and cluster into groups of different sizes. this is in line with data for other plant species  <cit> . various mechanisms including recombination, gene conversion, duplication and selection are thought to contribute to the genome-wide diversity and distribution of nb-lrr gene loci  <cit> . equal intragenic crossing-over results in domain swaps between genes whereas unequal crossing-over influences the number of genes within a locus and potentially places genes into a new structural context. tandem duplications, in which the copy is contiguous to the original gene, are typically associated with homogeneous clusters. of the  <dig> clusters,  <dig> are homogeneous and thus likely a result of tandem duplications. members of the subgroups cnl- <dig> to cnl- <dig> are often found on the same chromosome and, in some cases, within the same clusters, which is consistent with tandem duplication. in contrast, segmental and ectopic duplications, which involve the duplication of entire gene blocks or single/small groups of genes respectively, can position copies to unlinked sites including different chromosomes  <cit> . both cnl and tnl distributions display evidence for events that placed homologous genes onto different chromosomes that could be a result of either segmental or ectopic duplication. these events appear to be more common for tnls that are more widely dispersed throughout the genome and not found in clusters as frequently as cnls.

the sequencing of dm provides a snapshot of the potato genome organisation, and specifically the distribution of and relationships among nb-lrr genes on individual chromosomes. although specific to dm, this analysis provides important insight into the nb-lrr gene compositions of other members of the solanaceae. studies in arabidopsis have shown, for example, that some r genes display high levels of polymorphism within and between populations  <cit> . a more detailed analysis of the potato r <dig> locus  <cit> , for which three haplotypes from s. demissum have been described  <cit> , confirmed evidence of copy number variations and is consistent with tandem duplications. as previously described, the r <dig> locus is flanked by bs4-like and prf-like genes but the number of r1-homologues varies between one and  <dig> in s. demissum and five in dm . another example is the r <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> which was originally described in a diploid potato population, shxrh  <cit> . overall, r <dig> cluster organisation is syntenic between sh-haplotypes and the sequenced dm, in that the r3a-clusters  and the r3b cluster  flank the marker gp <dig> . however, in dm, the physical distance between the clusters c <dig> and c <dig> amounts to more than  <dig> kb and is thus approximately  <dig> kb shorter than the same region in sh  <cit> . in dm, nine r3b homologues reside in cluster c <dig>  and li et al.   <cit>  describe six and ten homologues for the two sh haplotypes. unequal representation of lineages within the nb-lrr superfamily and copy number variation between haplotypes is consistent with a 'birth and death' model in which some nb-lrrs are lost and new lineages evolve whilst others are retained  <cit> .

we have observed  <dig> nb-lrr genes in a doubled monoploid potato, which represents a single haplotype. potato cultivars and breeding lines are generally heterozygous tetraploids, which exhibit tetrasomic inheritance during crossing. the high levels of structural diversity observed in homologous r gene clusters from different potato haplotypes , and the extremely high levels of sequence polymorphism observed in potato, imply that it is highly likely that any given tetraploid potato clone may contain as many as  <dig>  distinct nb-lrrs in its genome. a key objective for future resistance breeding is to understand the allelic diversity of nb-lrr genes in potato. such an objective will require application of high throughput sequencing technologies allied to advanced bioinformatic tools for assembling sequence data from very closely related genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> nb-lrr type genes within the sequenced potato s. tuberosum group phureja , of which several are homologous to functionally characterised r genes. comprehensive analysis of the nb-lrrs, both in terms of the phylogenetic relationships of cnls and tnls and their positions on the respective chromosomes, provides an invaluable tool for the identification of novel and functional r genes from wild solanum species in the future. new technologies, including exon capture followed by high throughput sequencing and allele mining rely on detailed information concerning r gene organisation and distribution. furthermore, knowledge about the genomic organisation of these genes will facilitate comparative and evolutionary studies on a whole genome level or, alternatively, for selected clusters.
