BACKGROUND
until a few years ago, medical laboratories performed mold identification using phenotypic characterization of colonies and occasional sequencing of informative dna targets. currently, the maldi-tof ms  approach appears to be a promising method to identify molds and dermatophytes .

many teams around the world have demonstrated that filamentous fungi could be identified by using maldi-tof ms. they first focused attention on a few specific mold and dermatophyte genera . only after  <dig> did research teams begin optimizing protocols to establish a maldi-tof ms-based identification approach for routine diagnosis of filamentous fungi and dermatophytes . currently, four commercial systems are available for routine diagnosis, and an increasing number of publications have tested their performance in identifying molds and dermatophytes. some teams have assessed the saramis  <cit> , vitek ms  or andromas  <cit>  systems; however, most publications refer to the bruker technique . according to the bruker recommendations, the level of similarity between an unknown tested specimen and a reference sample is indicated by a log, which is referred to herein as “score”. a score >  <dig>  indicates “highly probable species identification”, a score >  <dig> and <  <dig>  indicates “secure genus identification, probable species identification”, a score >  <dig>  and <  <dig>  indicates “probable genus identification”, and a score <  <dig>  indicates “unreliable identification”.

however, these score thresholds have been designed for bacteria identification and are not necessarily appropriate for fungi  while using the manufacturer’s reference database  <cit> . the majority of publications dealing with maldi-tof ms routine identification of filamentous fungi have used a single score threshold, usually ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , depending on the study  <cit> . however, a study by shultness et al.  <cit>  has compared the  <dig>  and  <dig>  score thresholds for maldi-tof ms identification after a liquid culture growth step in which no assessment was performed to justify these thresholds. additionally, while the manufacturer typically recommends a single spot for bacterial identification, some authors have advocated the use of several spots of the same sample to identify molds and dermatophytes  <cit> . according to these authors, the concordance between identification results can be tested using replicates. theoretically, this may improve the reliability of identification results, although no study has thoroughly evaluated the optimal number of spots and log threshold for mold identification. altogether, the use of various thresholds and validation criteria for mold and dermatophyte identification complicate the interpretation of results.

the present study assessed  <dig> distinct identification algorithms combining several thresholds for one to four spots per sample. because the bruker reference database is not comprehensive enough to enable proper identification of many mold species,  <cit>  identification algorithms were assessed using an extensive in-house database  and the bruker commercial database . our objective was to optimize the fungal identification workflow in laboratories equipped with a bruker maldi-tof ms identification platform.

methods
reference databases
the in-house reference database was constructed using a microflex lt system  in coordination with the bccm/ihem culture collection and the mycology laboratory of the ap-hm with the protocol described by normand et al.  <cit>  . details of the ms in-house database are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

assessment panel
the assessment panel consisted of filamentous fungus strains that were identified via both dna sequencing and maldi-tof ms. the strains were either selected at the mycology laboratory of marseille  or the bccm/ihem in brussels . of the  <dig> strains from marseille,  <dig> were included because the identification at the species level had to be either clarified or confirmed at the time of the study, while the remaining  <dig> were randomly selected among frequently identified species in the clinical laboratory. the  <dig> belgian strains either originated from the bccm/ihem collection or were clinical strains from a previous study  <cit> . the 422-strain panel included  <dig> different species belonging to  <dig> genera, of which  <dig> strains were represented three or more times in the maldi-tof ms reference database ,  <dig> strains were represented once or twice , and  <dig> strains were not represented in the reference database  . all samples were first included in the study panel, even those corresponding to species absent from the databases to ensure that the tested algorithms correctly excluded absent species. next, the identification process was tested again, this time only including the isolates corresponding to species represented by at least three distinct strains in the database to comply with the recommendations we have issued in a previous study  <cit> .table  <dig> panel description obtained after dna sequencing of the strains and representation of the entire set of species in the in-house reference spectrum database

identification of the strains from the assessment panel
maldi-tof ms-based identification
liquid culture technology used in the bruker protocol being not available in the two centers that participated to the study, culturing was performed on solid agar. after culturing the molds on solid sabouraud chloramphenicol gentamicin agar plates   for at least 48 h at 30 °c and the dermatophytes on solid sabouraud actidione  at 27 °c, the strains were treated as described by cassagne et al. <cit> , and as advised by the manufacturer : the colonies were gently scrapped using a scalpel blade, and the fungal material  was suspended in a microtube containing 900 μl of anhydrous ethyl alcohol  and 300 μl of sterile water . after a 10-min centrifugation step at  <dig>  rpm, the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of formic acid . after 5 min of incubation, 10 μl of acetonitrile  was added. the suspension was then centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 2 min, and four spots of 1 μl of protein extract per isolate were deposited. last, the samples were covered with 1 μl of hcca  matrix . ms acquisition was performed either in marseille or brussels using a microflex lt system. all raw spectra were then centralized in marseille and compared to the two reference databases. for all  <dig> tested spectra  and each database, three possible scores were collected: the highest score corresponding to a true ms identification result at the species level if available, the highest score corresponding to a true identification at the genus level but false at the species level if available, and in all cases, the highest score false at the genus level.

dna sequence-based identification
all strains belonging to the assessment panel were identified via dna sequencing, which is the current gold standard in fungal identification. nucleotide sequence analysis was performed either in marseille  or brussels . the rrna its <dig> region was sequenced for each strain . an additional locus was analyzed to identify particular taxa: the partial beta-tubulin gene  was sequenced for aspergillus, penicillium and scedosporium species, while the elongation factor  was sequenced for fusarium species. the hybridization temperatures applied for these primers were 54 °c for the its and beta-tubulin genes and 58 °c for the elongation factor gene. the dna sequence-based identification criteria were as follows: a sequence longer than  <dig> base pairs and at least 99% homology with the ncbi and cbs nucleotide databases  <cit> .

identification algorithms
the following  <dig> distinct algorithms were used to identify the  <dig> isolates included in the panel.a: only one spot  is taken into account.

b: the first two spots are taken into account. b1: only the identification corresponding to the higher of the two scores is taken into account, plotted and categorized.

 b2: to be accepted at the species level, both identifications corresponding to the two spots must be identical, and the same rule applies for the identification at the genus level.




c: the first three spots are taken into account. c1: only the identification corresponding to the highest of the three scores is taken into account, plotted and categorized.

 c2: to be categorized as a concordant identification, the identification corresponding to the highest score must be identical to at least one of the other two identifications .

 c3: to be categorized as a concordant identification, the three identifications corresponding to the three spots must be identical .




d: all four spots are taken into account. d1: only the identification corresponding to the highest of the four scores is taken into account, plotted and categorized.

 d2: to be categorized as a concordant identification, the identification corresponding to the highest score must be identical to at least one of the other three identifications .

 d3: to be categorized as a concordant identification, the identification corresponding to the highest score must be identical to at least two of the other three identifications .

 d4: to be categorized as a concordant identification, the four identifications corresponding to the four spots must be identical .







based on the individual spectrum results,  <dig> identification algorithms  were tested per strain. for each spectrum, only the first identification  and the corresponding scores were collected. each of the  <dig> algorithms was then tested using the identification thresholds  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the entire panel consisting of  <dig> strains. the same process was applied for a reduced panel of  <dig> isolates that were represented at least three times in the in-house reference database and for another reduced panel of  <dig> isolates that were represented at least three times in the commercial database by bruker.

statistical analyses
an initial identification assessment was carried out by categorizing the first identification for each spot into three classes:  concordant at the species level with the dna-based identification,  concordant at the genus level but not at the species level with the dna-based identification, or  discordant at the genus level with the dna-based identification. we then determined the best rules for accepting identification at the genus and species levels. for each threshold, algorithm, panel and database, we calculated the percentage of submitted strains that fulfilled the criteria for identification as well as the positive predictive value  of the identification result at the genus and species levels.

RESULTS
maldi-tof ms-based identification
using our in-house database to identify the  <dig> strains included in the panel, a clear separation was observed between the highest scores corresponding to true identifications at the species level and the highest scores corresponding to a false genus identification. conversely, it was markedly more difficult to define a satisfying cut-off that differentiated between the highest scores corresponding to an accurate species identification and the highest scores corresponding to an accurate genus but false species identification . using the commercial database led to a similar observation, although the separation between the three curves was less pronounced .fig.  <dig> highest log value distribution of the  <dig> tested spectra. a considering the first accurate species identification , the first accurate genus identification , and the first false genus identification  using the in-house reference database. b considering the first accurate species identification , the first accurate genus identification , and the first false genus identification  using the bruker reference database

notable differences in successful identification rates were highlighted between the  <dig> algorithms . in particular, with both references databases, the algorithm that selected the best results among four spots  increased the accepted identification rate   without notably changing the identification ppv. by contrast, the inter-spot concordance criteria did not increase the identification ppv at the species level and reduced the accepted result rate . the main difference between the results obtained with the two databases was the percentage of accepted identifications, which was markedly lower with the bruker database than with the in-house reference database . additionally, while the ppv for genus level identification was 100% for both databases using the  <dig>  threshold, regardless of the other decision criteria applied, the ppv for species level identification was better with our in-house database than with the bruker database . using the in-house reference database, the d <dig> combination with a threshold at  <dig>  yielded  <dig> % of accepted identifications, with a species identification ppv of  <dig> .

we noted an increase in the species ppv with threshold values higher than  <dig> , but the loss in percentage of identification is important. using the identification score threshold of  <dig> , as recommended by the manufacturer, led to a  <dig> % decrease in accepted identifications and only a 2% increase in the ppv. the “highly probable species identification” criterion by bruker  yielded a species ppv of  <dig>  but only  <dig> % of accepted identifications  using our in-house database. the identification results were even less acceptable when using the commercial database, with only  <dig> strains  reaching the  <dig>  threshold and  <dig> strains  reaching the  <dig>  threshold.

for  <dig> strains, the identification best score using the d <dig> algorithm was higher than the  <dig>  threshold, although the species level result was incorrect using the in-house database. for all of these strains, proper identification at the species level was impeded by the close similarity of the maldi-tof ms spectra of some species belonging to the same species complex . the details of these strains are presented in table  <dig>  the same finding was observed for  <dig> misidentifications obtained using the bruker database .table  <dig> list of the  <dig> identification failures obtained using the bruker database and the d <dig> algorithm with a score above the  <dig>  threshold

analyses of the identification performances for the restricted panels with the bruker database and the in-house database
the robustness of the identification algorithms was tested by performing the same analysis on a restricted panel including only the strains that were represented by at least three distinct strains in the reference spectrum libraries  is different than the one used with the in-house database  due to the differences in databases composition). as expected, the results were better than those obtained with the 422-strain panel , with a higher percentage of results reaching the thresholds  and a reduced number of misidentifications. for example, using the in-house database, the species ppv for the d <dig> algorithm with a  <dig>  score threshold on the comprehensive 422-strain panel increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when testing a sub-panel including only the  <dig> strains for which species were represented by at least three distinct strains. similar trends were observed when using the commercial database .table  <dig> performance comparison of the  <dig> different algorithms tested on the sub-panel of  <dig> strains that are represented by three or more strains in the bruker reference library

discussion
as shown in this study and several others, maldi-tof ms has recently been optimized to identify filamentous fungi at the species level, provided that an appropriate database is available . the assessment panel used in this study comprised isolates belonging to  <dig> different species, including many difficult-to-identify isolates. consequently, the identification rate was low compared with previously published studies, especially studies utilizing the commercial database. using such a challenging panel, it was possible to define a threshold discriminating correct identifications at the species level from false identifications at the genus level, although identifying a threshold that differentiated between a correct and false identification at the species level among closely related species was not feasible. our findings indicate that the best identification results  were obtained when applying a decisional algorithm in which only the highest score of four spots was taken into account, and the identification was accepted if the score was at least  <dig> . this threshold is notably lower than that recommended for bacteria identification, and has already been advised by several authors for yeast identification  <cit> . furthermore, we also observed a marked decrease in percentage of identification between a threshold of  <dig>  and  <dig> . when the threshold was set too high, we noted a 20% loss in identification efficiency and only a small benefit of 2% in the differentiation of certain close species. even if the bruker commercial database yielded a markedly lower percentage of accepted identifications , the ppv remained correct for the spectra reaching the  <dig>  threshold. this result corroborates the findings of several authors who have suggested that lowering the identification score thresholds would improve maldi-tof ms-based fungal identification efficiency  <cit> . however, we strongly advise against a threshold below  <dig> , which could yield an increase in false identifications, in particular at the genus level, as shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

the major problem encountered with the data set obtained from the assessment panel was the resemblance between the maldi-tof ms spectra of some species. for  <dig> strains, the similarity in maldi-tof ms spectra yielded an incorrect identification at the species level, although these identification errors systematically corresponded to taxonomically close species often belonging to the same species complex . among these  <dig> strains , only a few species are known to be pathogenic to humans, of which none are major human pathogens. regarding the pathogenic species that were misidentified in our study, the treatment would not vary from that prescribed based on molecular identification, and the differentiation of these species is not clinically relevant. the remaining species are often considered to be a result of contamination, and their antifungal susceptibility is unknown. interestingly, raising the identification score threshold to  <dig>  did not entirely resolve this identification issue of taxonomically close species, as six strains were incorrectly characterized despite a score above  <dig> , even using our extensive in-house database. thus, in our study, one could question the relevance of capacity and necessity to distinguish between these closely related species as none of the misidentifications implied a change in treatment.

our results also show that the key step in efficient identification was to increase the number of replicate spots per strain. testing four spots of each filamentous fungus yielded better identification performance, with an increase of 5% to 7% of accepted strain identifications. such spot replications did not markedly increase the workload, as it took only a few seconds to perform the additional spots. however, the replicates may increase the per-strain acquisition time in the laboratory workflow. the four-spot method has been applied in the routine workflow at the marseille mycology laboratory for the past five years, which demonstrates that this procedure is easily applicable in hospital laboratories to identify filamentous fungi isolated from clinical samples and from hospital environment samples. multiplying the number of deposits per strains imply a small increase in the cost per strain as only one reagent  has to be used more extensively. the decisional algorithm implying concordance of the identification results of two to four spots did not enhance identification performance, regardless of the threshold selected. furthermore, the d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> algorithms tended to lower the percentage of validated identifications by disregarding identification results that would have been correct using the d <dig> decisional algorithm.

when focusing on the species that were represented by at least three distinct strains in the reference spectrum library, identification efficacy markedly increased. this result stresses the importance of a comprehensive reference spectrum library for the identification of filamentous fungi, including dermatophytes, as previously reported by our group  <cit> , and as previously demonstrated for yeasts  <cit> . the multiplication of strains per species as well as subcultures per strain allowed us to cover the variations seen within the environment for filamentous fungi.

our in-house reference database, which yielded markedly better results compared with the commercial bruker database, was constructed mainly with collection strains and with some clinical strains isolated in our laboratory and obtained during routine analyses. these clinical strains were later included in the bccm/ihem collection in brussels. nevertheless, even our enhanced database still requires optimization to identify rare species. indeed, the poor representation of rare species in the database may explain the identification percentage of  <dig> % obtained with this challenging panel of  <dig> strains , compared with the extremely good identification results of common species  exposed by gautier et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the growing number of publications on maldi-tof ms-based fungal identification indicates that this technology is widely used and applicable to the routine laboratory workflow. maldi-tof ms-based identification of fungi yields exceedingly more accurate results compared with morphology-based analyses  <cit> . furthermore, this technology is less expensive and easier than the current dna based-identification gold standard, with a turnaround time allowing achieving the analysis more rapidly. currently, the major limitation of this approach is the lack of a comprehensive and efficient reference spectrum library. we acknowledge that in-house reference databases that are non-open-source, such as ours, are of little benefit to the global scientific community. therefore, we plan to deploy an accessible version of our database along with an identification algorithm that can be queried online to assist scientific teams to expand the identification of fungal species. experiments implying a multicenter approach are ongoing to finalize this project.
