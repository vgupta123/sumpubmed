BACKGROUND
ubiquitin ligases control the modification of proteins with ubiquitin by interacting with specific substrates. they play critical roles in neuronal functions and homeostasis. for example, mutations of the ubiquitin ligase ube3a cause angelman syndrome  <cit> . ube3a regulates the degradation of arc, a synaptic protein that promotes the internalization of the ampa subtype of glutamate receptors  <cit> . another example is that the ubiquitin ligase parkin is mutated in early onset parkinson’s disease  <cit> . parkin is involved in the clearance of damaged mitochondria  <cit> . it has been shown recently that mutations of another ubiquitin ligase cullin-4b  in the x chromosome cause x-linked intellectual disability  in males  <cit> . genetic mutations of cul4b account for about 3% of the xlid population, which places cul4b as one of the most commonly mutated genes underlying xlid  <cit> . such cul4b mutations include large c-terminal truncations and missense mutations in or near the cullin domain that may impair or nullify cul4b ubiquitin ligase activity  <cit> . intellectual disability is a consistent feature associated with cul4b-xlid, but the physiological function of cul4b in neuronal cells or neurodevelopment remains to be determined.

cul4b belongs to the family of cullin-ring ubiquitin ligases , in which the cullin serves as the scaffolding protein in the modular crls  <cit> . cullins are covalently modified by the ubiquitin-like protein nedd <dig> in a conserved lysine residue in the c-terminus that also binds to a ring  protein rbx <dig> or rbx <dig>  <cit> . neddylation of cullins activates crls by inducing a conformational change that promotes ubiquitin transfer to the substrate for ubiquitination  <cit> . the n-terminus of cullins interacts with cullin-specific substrate receptor subunits usually via adaptor proteins  <cit> . cullin neddylation depends on the assembly of the crl complex including the ring protein and the substrates. besides neddylation that activates crls, the cop <dig> signalosome  and cand <dig> also positively regulate crl activity  <cit> . another regulator aspp <dig> inhibits cullin neddylation and opposes app-bp1-mediated cell cycle progression  <cit> .

among the seven cullins identified, cul4a and cul4b are derived from the same ancestral cul <dig>  there is 83% identity between human cul4a and cul4b. cul4b is present only in mammals and differs from cul4a mainly by an amino terminal extension that may confer cul4b-specificity. the architecture of cul4s looks similar, with both binding to rbx <dig> and the adaptor protein dna damage-binding protein- <dig>   <cit> . ddb <dig> binds to a substrate-specific wd-repeat-containing protein  <cit> . cul4a is necessary for embryonic development since cul4a knockout mice are embryonic lethal  <cit> . however, the lethality was questioned since a second line of cul4a mutant mice that delete exons 17- <dig> that encode the rbx <dig> binding site and the neddylation site in the cul4a gene, produces viable mice due. the lethality of the first strain may be caused by the unintentional deletion of a region upstream of the first exon of the essential psid <dig> gene in the cul4a mutant mice  <cit> .

the functional analyses of cul4b are hindered by the lack of a knockout animal model, but available data in literature suggest that cul4b plays significant roles in many aspects of cellular functions. like cul4a, cul4b also ubiquitinates histone h2a, h <dig>  and h <dig>  facilitating the recruitment of repair proteins to the damaged dna  <cit> . cul4b mutant carrier-derived cells are impaired in camptothecin-induced topoisomerase i degradation and ubiquitination  <cit> . cul4b has also been shown to regulate dioxin-dependent receptor signaling  <cit> . in addition, cul4b downregulates cyclin e  <cit>  and β-catenin  <cit> . cul4b suppression increases β-catenin levels in rodent cells  <cit> . cul4b accumulates in the nucleus during cell differentiation  <cit> . more recently, cul4b has been shown to downregulate wdr <dig>  <cit>  and peroxiredoxin iii  <cit> .

motivated by the recent discoveries that cul4b mutations cause xlid, we analyzed cul4b functions in neuronal tissues in vivo and in vitro. we found that unneddylated cul4b isoforms accumulated during mitosis of the cell cycle in neural progenitor cells . downregulation of cul4b by shrnas arrested the cell cycle in the g2/m phase in npcs and in human nt- <dig> cells. npcs that strongly expressed cul4b were found in the subventricular zone  and the subgranular zone  in both mouse and human brain tissues. such cul4b-positive cells co-expressed high levels of β-catenin in vivo. furthermore, these cul4b-expressing npcs were not apoptotic based on tunel staining and flow cytometric analyses. taken together, these data suggest that the accumulation of unneddylated cul4b is necessary for mitosis progression in npcs.

RESULTS
cul4b expression in rodent brain extracts by immunoprecipitation-western blotting
the rabbit anti-cul4b antibody obtained from proteintech was raised against cul4b, which consisted of cul4a homologous sequences that might lead to cross-reactions with cul4a . to determine the specificity of this anti-cul4b antibody, npcs were transfected with gfp or gfp-tagged n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of cul4b . the whole cell lysate was probed with either the anti-cul4b or mouse anti-gfp. as shown in figure 1a, the cul4b antibody specifically recognized gfp <dig> , whereas the anti-gfp antibody recognized both gfp <dig> and gfp . a minor band around  <dig> amino-acid longer than gfp was also found in the gfp173-expressing cells as indicated by a *, which suggests that cul4b might be cleaved near the nuclear localization signal on the n-terminus  <cit> .

the c-terminal cul4b has the consensus neddylation site and has been shown to be neddylated in vitro <cit> . neddylation of cullins may serve as a switch for a conformational change that leads to the activation of ubiquitination by crls. to determine if cul4b was neddylated, adult mouse brain protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-cul4b antibody. the blot was first probed with the anti-nedd <dig> antibody. rat and mouse cul4bs have three major isoforms due to alternative splicing based on the sequences from the uniprotkb/swiss-prot data base. the calculated molecular weights  of mouse cul4bs were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> kda . compared to cul4b- <dig>  cul4b- <dig> missed the first  <dig> amino acids whereas cul4b- <dig> missed amino acids 693- <dig>  as shown in figure 1b , the band recognized by the anti-nedd <dig> antibody was likely to be cul4b- <dig>  the rabbit anti-nedd <dig> antibody used in the blots was the best anti-nedd <dig> and is commonly used by other researchers.

to determine if the anti-cul4b immunoprecipitation experiment worked, the blot was stripped and reprobed with the anti-cul4b antibody. the major immunoprecipitated band corresponded to cul4b- <dig> since it migrated at the predicted molecular weight . a minor upper band corresponding to cul4b- <dig> was also detected by the cul4b antibody. however, as shown by the nedd <dig> blot, cul4b- <dig> and - <dig> were not neddylated since the anti-nedd <dig> antibody did not recognized these bands .

the nedd8-positive lower band precipitated by the anti-cul4b antibody was further evaluated with antibodies against cul4a and cul <dig>  in this experiment, the immuno-precipitates were analyzed in triplicates by blotting with the anti-cul4b, anti-cul4a, and anti-cul <dig> antibodies, respectively . the results showed that the anti-cul4a or anti-cul <dig> antibodies recognized a band corresponding to the molecular weights of cul4a and cul <dig>  respectively, in the whole brain extract, but they did not recognize the neddylated lower band in the cul4b precipitate as identified in figure 1b . these experiments also showed that the anti-cul4a and anti-cul <dig> antibodies cross-reacted with cul4b since they recognized the immunoprecipitated cul4b- <dig>  the results suggest that the lower neddylated band identified in figure 1b  was not cul4a or cul <dig>  thus, the neddylated band was likely to be cul4b- <dig>  cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> appeared to be the major species in the brain as shown in the whole brain extract, but the antibody precipitated more cul4b- <dig>  cul4b- <dig> might be the least abundant since the anti-cul4b antibody did not recognize this isoform in the whole brain extract. however, the efficiency of the anti-cul4b in recognizing cul4b- <dig> might be less since this isoform missed the first  <dig> amino acids of cul4b- <dig> and  <dig>  which was part of the antigen. nonetheless, these data demonstrated that the anti-cul4b in use mainly recognized cul4b, especially cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig>  but not other cullins. the data also showed that the larger cul4b isoforms were unneddylated.

we next examined if the anti-cul4b antibody would also bring down the ligase adaptors. the antibody precipitated rbx <dig> in nt- <dig> cells and ddb <dig> from mouse brain homogenate . rbx <dig> was very abundant in nt- <dig> cells. since the level of ddb <dig> in whole brain lysate was below the detection limit, the anti-ddb <dig> immunoprecipitate was used as a positive control. ddb <dig> appeared to be a limiting factor and the amount co-precipitated by the cul4b antibody was less than that precipitated by the ddb <dig> antibody, suggesting that only some cul4b  was bound to ddb <dig> 

cul4b was not neddylated in vitro or in vivo as shown by immunostaining
the above experiments suggest that the anti-cul4b mainly recognized unneddylated cul4b isoforms in brain tissues. we have shown previously that neddylated proteins are present in the nucleus of normal neuronal cells  <cit> . cul4b sequences are highly conserved among mammalian species. like rodent cells, human cells also have three major isoforms of cul4b according to uniprotkb/swiss-prot data base. in human cells, compared to the canonical cul4b- <dig> that has  <dig> amino acids, cul4b- <dig> misses the first  <dig> amino acids and cul4b- <dig> misses the first  <dig> amino acids and differs in amino acids 197- <dig>  to determine if the anti-cul4b mainly recognized unneddylated cul4b, human nt- <dig> cells were immunostained with the rabbit anti-cul4b and the mouse anti-nedd <dig> antibodies. in the metaphase cell, most cul4b did not co-localize with nedd <dig> . in this cell, cul4b was present in the periphery whereas nedd <dig> accumulated around the condensed dna. in old nt- <dig> cells with extended processes that suggested cell differentiation, the processes often had cul4b especially at the process tip, but such cul4b was not neddylated . in g0-synchronized nt- <dig> cells, nedd <dig> accumulated in the nucleus whereas cul4b was still in the process tip . in contrast to cul4b, cul <dig> was present in the nucleus in g0-synchronized nt- <dig> cells .

to determine if cul4b and nedd <dig> colocalized in vivo, human hippocampal brain sections were immunostained with the anti-cul4b and the mouse anti-nedd <dig> antibodies . smaller cells and the ependymal cells along the ventricle were clearly labeled by the nedd <dig> antibody. however, the cul4b-positive cells expressed little nedd <dig>  a tiny amount of punctate nedd <dig> staining was present in the cul4b-positive cells, which might represent neddylated cul4b- <dig>  but it was almost negligible compared to the huge amount of unneddylated cul4b . the huge amount of cul4b appeared to inhibit dapi staining of the dna in these cells.

to summarize, the data showed that the anti-cul4b specifically recognized cul4b but not other cullins. this antibody mainly recognized unneddylated cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> that accumulated in npcs or nt- <dig> cells. since all isoforms of cul4b have the c-terminal neddylation consensus site, the data suggest that the presence of the extended n-terminus in cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> but missing in cul4b- <dig> may inhibit neddylation.

cul4b was expressed during mitosis of the cell cycle in npcs
we have previously demonstrated our ability to grow primary npcs that express nestin and ki <dig> from e <dig> rat cortices  <cit> . taking advantage of these primary cultures, we first determined the expression pattern of cul4b during the cell cycle. only a small fraction of npcs expressed cul4b in a given npc culture . these cul4b-positive cells were also nestin-positive, but unlike the other nestin-positive cells, they appeared to have retracted their processes, a feature of cells undergoing mitosis. we then examined the expression of cul4b during the cell cycle. based on the distinct morphologies of the dna in the cell cycle, cul4b was expressed mainly during mitosis in npcs . cul4b began to accumulate at the beginning of mitosis and it disappeared after cytokinesis. the analyses of cul4b levels also showed that cul4b levels were significantly higher during mitosis than during interphase in npcs .

to further confirm that cul4b was absent in interphase cells, npcs were pulse-labeled with brdu to identify the cells undergoing dna synthesis. in this experiment, npcs were exposed to brdu for  <dig> min and fixed right after the labeling. the brief treatment with brdu ensured that only those npcs undergoing s-phase dna synthesis would incorporated brdu. longer exposure with brdu would label cells at the other stages of the cell cycle as they grew continuously. the experiment showed that cul4b was not present in the brdu-labeled s-phase cells in rat primary npcs . similar brdu-labeling was performed in npcs isolated from day- <dig> newborn mouse cortices. the analyses showed that brdu-positive s-phase cells had significantly lower levels of cul4b than brdu-negative cells . these data suggest that cul4b plays a specific role in the progression of mitosis.

downregulation of cul4b arrested npcs in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle
to examine the function of cul4b during mitosis, a cul4bshrna vector was constructed to downregulate cul4b expression. the selected targeting sequence  was previously tested by another laboratory  <cit> . this sequence is present in all three isoforms of cul4b. the expression of shrnas is under the control of the trnaval promoter  <cit> . a gfp open-reading frame under the cmv promoter is also present in this vector. when packaged into hsv- <dig>  the cul4bshrna vector efficiently downregulated cul4b in nt- <dig> cells compared to the control missense shrna . this suggests that the cul4b shrna effectively suppressed the expression of total cul4b.

the effect of the cul4bshrna vector in downregulating cul4b in primary npcs was then examined in transfected cells  by immunofluorescence microscopy. the analyses of these npcs revealed that cul4bshrna significantly downregulated cul4b compared to the control in npcs .

since cul4b was expressed during mitosis of the cell cycle, we next determined if cul4b downregulation by shrnas would affect cell cycle progression through the g2/m phase of the cell cycle. the dna content was determined in the transfected or infected, gfp-positive npcs by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining . the analyses showed that cul4b shrna-expression significantly increased the number of cells in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle. similar trends were observed in nt- <dig> cells expressing cul4bshrnas compared to those expressing missense shrnas . cul4b suppression by shrnas and expression of gfp did not induce apoptosis since the number of apoptotic/sub-g0/g <dig> cells did not increase. these data suggest that cul4b was necessary for cell cycle progression through the g2/m phase of the cell cycle in both npcs and nt- <dig> cells.

cul4b-positive npcs in nestin-gfp mice accumulated β-catenin
interestingly, β-catenin has been shown to accumulate periodically in the late g2/m phase of the cell cycle and abruptly decrease in the subsequent g <dig> phase in immortalized mouse epidermal keratinocyte mca3d cells  <cit> . svz and sgz are the major neurogenic niches in the brain. to evaluate the activity of cul4b in npcs in vivo, we used the nestin-gfp mouse strain that expressed gfp under the nestin-promoter, labeling all nestin-positive npcs  <cit> . the brain sections were co-immunostained with the antibodies against cul4b, gfp, and β-catenin. the results showed that some npcs expressed high levels of both cul4b and β-catenin in the svz and sgz . since β-catenin levels were high in the same npcs, the data suggest that the constitutive degradation of β-catenin was prevented in these npcs in late mitosis in vivo. although cul4b- <dig> was neddylated, the data suggest that cul4b- <dig> was unable to downregulate β-catenin probably due to its scanty presence in these cells. alternatively, unneddylated cul4bs might play a role in stabilizing β-catenin by forming complexes that prevented cul4b- <dig> ligase assembly and activation.

cul4b-positive cells expressed the mitotic marker mpm- <dig> in vivo
in vitro analyses suggest that cul4b accumulation is necessary for npc cell cycle progression through mitosis. in order to determine the cell cycle status of the npcs in vivo, brain sections were immunostained with the mpm- <dig> monoclonal antibody. the mpm- <dig> antibody was originally raised against mitotic hela cells. it specifically recognizes a cell cycle-regulated, serine/threonine-phosphorylated epitope present in mitotic and meiotic proteins from a wide variety of species. these proteins become phosphorylated at the g2/m transition and are dephosphorylated at the end of mitosis  <cit> . in brain sections from one-month-old mice, cul4b-positive cells were also stained with the mpm- <dig> antibody in sgz . these data further support the observations that unneddylated cul4b accumulated during mitosis.

cul4b-positive npcs in human brain accumulated β-catenin and were not apoptotic
as shown in figure 2c, some cells in the human brain expressed a huge amount of cul4b that co-expressed little nedd <dig>  we found that these cul4b-positive cells were mainly located in svz and sgz, two major neurogenic areas of the human brain . in these cells, β-catenin levels were very high. the accumulation of both cul4b and β-catenin in the same cells again suggests that cul4b did not downregulate β-catenin during mitosis, but instead cul4b might have stabilized β-catenin. in the same cells, cyclin e only accumulated in npcs in sgz, not in svz, suggesting that cul4b might regulate cyclin e only in sgz.

the in vivo data suggest that the accumulation of unneddylated cul4b during mitosis in npcs is a physiological phenomenon. we next determined if these cul4b-positive cells were healthy and not undergoing apoptosis by tunel staining. as shown in figure 5d, cells that expressed cul4b were negative for tunel staining. in contrast, some nearby cul4b-negative ependymal cells lining the ventricle were tunel-positive. thus, the cul4b-positive cells did not have fragmented dna, indicating that they were not apoptotic. together, these data suggest that the accumulation of cul4b during mitosis plays a physiological role in npc cell cycle progression in the human brain.

discussion
since cul4b mutations are associated with xlid, this study examined the functions of the endogenous cul4b in npcs and brain tissues. through a series of immunoprecipitation-western experiments, this study first demonstrated that the anti-cul4b antibody specifically detected cul4b, especially the two larger isoforms cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig>  further analyses demonstrated that the two larger isoforms were unneddylated whereas the smaller isoform cul4b- <dig> was neddylated in rodent brain protein extracts. this study showed that downregulation of cul4b in rodent npcs or human nt- <dig> cells arrested the cell cycle in the g2/m phase, suggesting that cul4b accumulation was necessary for cell cycle progression through mitosis in these cells. furthermore, cul4b-positive cells co-expressed the mpm- <dig> mitotic epitope in brain sections, suggesting that cul4b also accumulated in vivo in npcs during mitosis. finally, cul4b expression was not associated with dna fragmentation in vivo. together, these data suggest that a physiological function of cul4b is in mitosis progression in npcs, which involves the accumulation of inactive cul4b during mitosis.

neddylation serves as a switch for activating crl activity. this study demonstrated that the two larger isoforms of cul4b, cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig>  were not neddylated, which suggest that these two isoforms of cul4b may be inactive in downregulating substrates. the absence of neddylation in cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> was not caused by spontaneous deneddylation since the inhibitor, opt, was present in the experiment. the anti-nedd <dig> antibody also worked since it recognized the smaller cul4b- <dig> precipitated by the cul4b antibody. a recent study has shown that more cul4b is constitutively associated with the deneddylase cop <dig> than cul <dig>  <cit> . such tight association of cul4b with cop <dig> may account for the absence of neddylation in cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> isoforms, which we found were more abundant in brain tissues. despite the absence of neddylation in cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig>  cul4b- <dig> that lacked the n-terminal portion was neddylated. in nt- <dig> cells and brain tissues, ddb <dig> was below the detection limit in whole protein extract. the anti-cul4b antibody precipitated very little ddb <dig>  which on one hand suggest that most cul4b was not assembled with ddb <dig> and on the other suggests that the co-precipitated ddb <dig> was probably bound to cul4b- <dig>  since the major difference between cul4b- <dig> and the other two isoforms was the lack of the n-terminal sequences in cul4b- <dig>  the data suggest that the n-terminus of cul4b may inhibit neddylation which normally occurs in the consensus lysine residue in the c-terminal cullin domain. during the preparation of this manuscript, at least two cul4b-knockout mouse models have been attempted but both resulted in early embryonic lethality  <cit> . human mutations include c-terminal truncations or misssense mutations, which are predicted to affect cul4b ubiquitin ligase activity, but null mutations are not observed. these observations suggest the n-terminus of cul4b may support survival of human mutation carriers by a mechanism involving inhibition of neddylation.

this study also showed that increased levels of cul4b co-existed with high levels of β-catenin in npcs in the neurogenic niches, sgz and svz, from both rodent and human brains. neddylation is necessary for β-catenin degradation since β-catenin accumulates in npcs expressing a dominant negative nedd8-conjugating enzyme ubc <dig> . there was also little evidence that the cul4b-expressing npcs co-expressed any nedd <dig>  these data suggest that unneddylated cul4b accumulated in a particular population of npcs in vivo. previous studies have shown that in the absence of wnt signaling, β-catenin is constitutively downregulated via the scf complex  <cit> . furthermore, β-catenin may be a cul4b ligase substrate  <cit>  although it has not been replicated by independent laboratories. together with the findings in this study, the data suggest that cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> may compete with neddylated cul <dig> and possibly neddylated cul4b- <dig>  to transiently inhibit the degradation of certain substrates such as β-catenin during mitosis. in this sense, the unneddylated cul4b still plays an active role in mitosis progression. it has been shown that β-catenin peaks periodically at the g2/m phase of the cell cycle in proliferating cells  <cit> . a specific function of β-catenin has been shown to establish the bipolar mitotic spindle during mitosis  <cit> . these previous studies suggest that β-catenin is specifically protected from degradation during mitosis, which may involve the accumulation of unneddylated cul4bs. future studies may focus on isoform-specific effects of cul4b in β-catenin downregulation when isoform-specific cul4bshrnas and antibodies are available.

why does cul4bshrnas arrest npcs in g2/m phase of the cell cycle? the cul4bshrnas used in this study targeted a sequence present in all three isoforms, the overall effect of which was to cause cell cycle arrest. cul4b is clearly necessary in early embryonic development since cul4b null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype  <cit> , which suggests that it functions in cell cycle progression. the current study suggests that cul4b not only functions in mitosis progression but also in cell cycle withdrawal. in proliferating npcs and nt- <dig> cells, maybe all isoforms of cul4b are necessary for cell cycle progression, whereas in differentiating cells, cul4b- <dig> and cul4b- <dig> may play a major role. npcs in human brains had a huge amount of cul4b in the cell body but very little nedd <dig>  which suggests that unneddylated cul4bs probably together with the small amount of neddylated cul4b- <dig>  are necessary for mitosis progression. the major supporting evidence for a role of cul4b in cell cycle withdrawal is that unneddylated cul4bs were abundant in growing processes in differentiating or g0-synchronized nt- <dig> cells. future investigations may focus on the potential isoform-specific effects of cul4b.

this study did not detect cul4b in s-phase npcs and downregulation of cul4b caused cell cycle arrest in g2/m in these cells. this is in contrast to the findings in hela cells where cul4b knockdown results in s-phase accumulation  <cit> . in addition, another study shows that silencing of cul4b in primary mef cells has little effect on cell proliferation  <cit> . the discrepancies may be due to cell type and methodology differences. the current study mainly employed primary npcs and examined endogenous cul4bs. the brdu labeling in the current study lasted for only  <dig> min. previous studies have also shown that cyclin e is a cul4b substrate, but it remains controversial given the stimulatory role of cyclin e in s phase progression and cell proliferation. the data from the current study also raised questions whether cul4b regulates cyclin e in svz npcs. the differential neddylation of cul4b isoforms as well as lack of specific antibodies as we found in this study suggest that caution is needed in interpreting the available data.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides strong evidence that the accumulation of cul4b during mitosis is necessary for npc cell cycle progression through mitosis. the data suggest that unneddylated cul4b isoforms specifically inhibit β-catenin degradation during mitosis. the data also show that cul4b- <dig> that misses the n-terminus present in the other two isoforms is neddylated, suggesting that the n-terminus may inhibit neddylation in the larger isoforms. furthermore, the presence of unneddylated cul4b in nt- <dig> cell processes suggests that it may have functions other than mitosis. the huge amount of unneddylated cul4b in human brain hippocampal npcs further suggests that cul4b plays a pivotal role in brain development. these findings have opened new avenues for future investigations, which will help understand the cognitive deficits present in cul4b-linked xlid.
