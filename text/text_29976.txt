BACKGROUND
hereditary sensorineural hearing loss  is a highly prevalent disorder in humans, affecting  <dig> in  <dig> newborns <cit> . there is considerable genetic heterogeneity underlying snhl. approximately  <dig> autosomal non-syndromic loci  have been mapped, and within these,  <dig> genes are causally implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss:  <dig> for dominant and  <dig> for recessive hearing loss. in addition, there are three non-syndromic x-linked genes known to date . despite the large number of implicated loci only one region has been shown to be a major etiological contributor to bilateral autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss . the dfnb1a/b locus contains the gjb <dig> and gjb <dig> genes, which encode the connexin  <dig> and connexin  <dig> proteins, respectively, and gjb <dig> has been shown to be frequently mutated in individuals with severe arnshl <cit> . because the region responsible for many of the remaining cases has not been identified there are likely to be other yet-to-be-discovered genetic contributors that may underlie a significant proportion of cases.

most snhl loci have been discovered using homozygosity mapping and other forms of linkage analysis in large consanguineous families  <cit> 
. there have been few genome-wide association studies on snhl  <cit> , and most mutations associated with snhl have been snvs . only one study has investigated the effects of copy number variants  on snhl in a comprehensive, though low-resolution fashion. this study found only one cnv, a deletion of the stereocilin gene strc, that was associated with snhl  <cit> . however, cnvs are enriched in genes involved in sensory perception of the environment  <cit>  including smell and taste receptors  <cit> . thus, there is a need to investigate the effects of cnv on snhl in a high-resolution, unbiased, genome-wide manner, and further to investigate the integrated effects of multiple types of variants on this phenotype  <cit> .

the advent of high-resolution, genome-wide variant mapping technologies, such as whole genome and exome sequencing, and microarray-based methods, now allows unbiased detection of the entire spectrum of genetic variants, including snvs, indels, and cnvs, in individual genomes . exome sequencing studies have identified novel snhl genes and/or mutations in probands, often followed by confirmation through limited analyses of other family members .

in this study, we explored the utility of diverse and complementary high-resolution approaches to detect genetic variants associated with snhl. we used multiple whole genome variant-mapping technologies, including exome sequencing and high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization , as well as familial and association strategies, to determine individually rare and frequent genetic contributors to snhl in three families and in over  <dig> individual probands, for whom no conclusive genetic etiology had previously been established. we report the discovery of rare compound heterozygous mutations in the myosin heavy chain 7b gene, myh7b, as a novel likely cause of snhl, by exome sequencing a family of five individuals. we also report several individually rare, novel candidate mutations for snhl, revealed by exome sequencing of two additional families  and  <dig> unrelated probands. finally, we conducted the first high-resolution, genome-wide cnv investigation for hearing loss. we report several novel cnv associations found in a cohort of  <dig> affected individuals and  <dig> controls, including a deletion on chromosome  <dig> encompassing the pdxdc <dig> gene, the has-mir- <dig> micro rna, and part of the npip. these results support our hypothesis that snhl may manifest due to either underlying shared or individually rare genetic etiologies in different cases, and arise by multiple mechanisms.

RESULTS
two strategies to investigate novel genetic contributors to snhl
we used two strategies to investigate the genetic variations underlying snhl in individuals for whom no previous genetic etiology had been established. the first strategy involved analyzing novel snv and indel associations with snhl using exome sequencing in three affected families and  <dig> additional isolated probands . the second approach involved analyzing genome-wide copy number changes using high-resolution acgh to discover cnvs associated with snhl in a cohort of  <dig> probands and  <dig> controls . this cohort includes the  <dig> isolated probands from the exome sequencing study. this multiple strategy approach was designed to provide a detailed, yet comprehensive investigation of the type and nature of mutations affecting hearing.table  <dig>

affected individuals were recruited at stanford university under irb approval. unaffected individuals matched for sex, age, and ethnicity were collected under irb approval at stanford university , mount sinai university  and yale university  using identical selection criteria. ethnicity was determined using principal components analysis with the human genome diversity panel.



exome sequencing of individuals with familial and sporadic hearing loss
we performed exome sequencing on three families with different levels of sensorineural hearing loss. the severity of the hearing loss was determined by behavioral pure tone audiometry. family  <dig> is of middle-eastern descent and afflicted with severe-profound bilateral hearing loss  and megalocornea with secondary glaucoma. family  <dig> is of european-caucasian descent and afflicted with moderate hearing loss . family  <dig> of european-caucasian descent has mild hearing loss  . we also performed exome sequencing on  <dig> additional probands and searched for rare, highly penetrant snvs and indels that may explain the phenotype. in each case we aligned 100 bp paired-end sequencing reads and called snvs and indels using the nucleotide-level variation tool from dnanexus. for the three families we also independently aligned reads and called snvs and indels using the variant  <dig>  algorithm from real time genomics  . we note that the total number of variants called per genome differ significantly between the two algorithms due to technical differences. dnanexus calls variants individually in each genome and then we used family structure to apply various segregation models. rtg uses the familial structure a priori to call variants segregating in the family under various inheritance models . we then used ingenuity variant analysis  to filter the variants based on quality, frequency in known populations, predicted deleteriousness, genetic analysis  and biological context . we discovered multiple potential genetic etiologies in the studied families and in the individual probands.figure  <dig>

compound heterozygous missense mutations in myh7b are the likely cause of hearing loss in family 1
family  <dig> has a severe hearing defect that segregates in a recessive manner . the exomes of the two unaffected parents and three affected children were analyzed as described above. of the  <dig>  and  <dig>  variants called by rtg and dnanexus, respectively, ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, had a call quality of at least  <dig> in all samples. variants with an allele frequency of 3% or greater in the genomes of the  <dig> genomes project, the public complete genomics genomes, or the nhlbi esp exomes , were excluded, leaving  <dig>  variants for rtg and  <dig>  for dnanexus.  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the rtg and dnanexus variants, respectively, were experimentally observed or predicted to be damaging by iva. further filtering based on segregation in a recessive fashion yielded six snp/indel  and three snp  variants. these independent analyses had only two variants in common. they were both heterozygous missense mutations in the myh7b gene on chromosome 20q <dig> . relaxing the rarity filter to encompass variants that occurred at a frequency ≤ 15% in the public genomes did not yield any additional candidates.

one of the two myh7b variants  is heterozygous in the father and the other  is heterozygous in the mother . each parent carries only one mutant allele but all three affected children are compound heterozygous for both mutations . the maternal variant was present in dbsnp  and present in the  <dig> genomes project and exome sequencing project samples at a frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the paternal variant was not present in dbsnp, the  <dig> genomes project, or the exome sequencing project samples. neither variant was present in any of the other exomes of probands in our cohort. thus, both variants appear to be rare and the paternal variant may be private to this family. we further analyzed these mutations using the combined annotation dependent depletion algorithm , a general framework for estimating the relative pathogenicity of genetic variants in humans  <cit> . they received scaled c scores of  <dig> and  <dig> for v <dig> and v <dig>  respectively, indicating that these variants are in the  <dig>  and  <dig>  percentile of most deleterious substitutions in the human genome, respectively . these variants were verified by sanger sequencing in all family members .figure  <dig>

myh7b encodes a heavy chain of myosin ii, a member of the motor-domain superfamily. the myosin ii molecule is a multi-subunit complex made up of two heavy chains and four light chains. the heavy chain comprises a catalytic globular motor domain, which carries out atp hydrolysis and interacts with actin, and a tail domain in which heptad repeat sequences promote dimerization by interacting to form a rod-like alpha-helical coiled coil. the maternal variant lies in the relay loop of the catalytic motor domain and the paternal variant is located in the tail domain, which is responsible for dimerization . the myh7b gene has not been previously implicated in hearing loss but has been linked to differentiation of inner ear hair cells  <cit>  and shown to control actin networks within neurons  <cit> .

myh7b is expressed in the inner ear
we next examined expression of the myh7b gene in the literature and in the allen brain atlas. myh7b was found to be concordantly expressed in embryonic mouse inner ear tissue but not in non-inner ear tissue, with atonal homolog 1a, atoh <dig>  a gene required for hair cell differentiation  <cit> . this concordant expression likely indicates a role for myh7b in development of hair cells in the inner ear. in addition, microarray data from the allen brain atlas indicates high myh7b expression in the primary auditory cortex and regions of the auditory pathway such as the cochlear nuclei and inferior colliculus, in adult humans  <cit> . furthermore, a reduction in myh7b expression in cultured mature rat hippocampal neurons can cause profound alterations to dendritic spine morphology, excitatory synaptic strength, and the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . it is possible that these effects may extend to other neuronal tissues including the auditory complex.

variant filtering results in a shortlist of potential causative mutations underlying the hearing loss in families  <dig> and 3
the hearing loss in family  <dig> is moderate and bilateral and appears to segregate in either a recessive or dominant de novo fashion in female twin offspring . an additional male sibling has multiple congenital abnormalities, including hearing loss, which can be explained by chromosomal abnormalities that are absent in the twins. accordingly, his hearing loss is different from that in the twins as confirmed by audiogram  and he was excluded from the analysis of this family. the exomes of the other four family members were analyzed as above. in this family,  <dig>  variants were called in total, either by rtg , dnanexus , or both . filtering was performed using iva on the union set of variants called by both algorithms to maximize findings. after removing common variants and low quality calls, two genetic models were applied; dominant de novo and recessive inheritance. we searched for dominant de novo mutations that were called by both rtg and dnanexus that occurred in both twins. no such mutations were found. however, two potential candidates were found by dnanexus only. these were a heterozygous in-frame deletion, , in the ctbs gene , and a heterozygous missense mutation  in the rbmxl <dig> gene  and in an intron of the gene ccbl <dig> . the search for underlying variants following a recessive pattern of inheritance did not generate any robust candidates.

family  <dig> is characterized by mild to moderate bilateral hearing loss appearing to segregate in an autosomal dominant fashion . however, the level of hearing loss in the mother is milder than that of the children. this indicates either incomplete penetrance of the causative allele that is segregating in an autosomal dominant manner, or compounding of the phenotype due to the additive effects of some putative paternal variant along with the maternal variant. it is also possible that the hearing loss in the mother is different from that in the children. however, this scenario is less likely given the seemingly mendelian inheritance.

the exomes of all four family members were analyzed as above. in total,  <dig>  variants were called either by rtg , dnanexus , or both . filtering was performed in iva on the union set of variants called by both algorithms. after removing common variants and low quality calls, only  <dig> variants were called by both rtg and dnanexus, were predicted to be deleterious by iva, and segregated in an autosomal dominant manner . all but one of these has been reported in dbsnp. in this set, seven missense mutations were found, of which four were predicted to be damaging and three were predicted to be activating by sift. five of these were heterozygous in all affected individuals while two were homozygous in the affected mother and heterozygous in the children. of these seven variants, six occur in biological pathways at most two nodes away from some gene known to be involved in autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss. these six missense variants located in networks containing known hearing loss genes  are the present leading causative candidate mutations in this family.table  <dig>

exome sequencing of individual probands reveals rare deleterious mutations in genes known to be associated with hearing loss
it is unknown how often sequencing of individuals with hearing loss will identify likely underlying causes of the disease. we therefore also sequenced the exomes of  <dig> individual probands for which additional family members were not available. we used dnanexus nucleotide-level variation analysis to detect snps and indels in each proband. between  <dig>  and  <dig>  variants were found in each exome . using the iva variant filtering scheme described in the methods and published at https://variants.ingenuity.com/haraksingh-etal-2013-hhla,  <dig>  potentially deleterious variants in  <dig>  genes were revealed in this set of probands. of these  <dig> variants occurred in  <dig> genes that have previously been associated with hearing loss. between 12– <dig> predicted deleterious variants  located in 10– <dig> genes  known to be associated with hearing loss were found in each proband . in each proband, between one and six known hearing loss genes  with more than one predicted deleterious mutation were found.figure  <dig>

in five of the  <dig> probands likely causative mutations can be identified. these are rare homozygous variants that are predicted to be damaging in known hearing loss genes. proband  <dig> carries a stop loss in the myo7a gene  and a missense mutation  in the myo1a gene. proband  <dig> has a missense mutation  in the ush2a gene that has been previously associated with usher syndrome in a spanish family. there is a rare in-frame variant  in the triobp gene in probands  <dig> and  <dig>  and proband  <dig> carries a missense mutation  in the gpr <dig> gene. proband  <dig> carries a missense mutation  in the ush1g gene. these damaging homozygous mutations are the strongest candidates for causing hearing loss in the five associated probands. retinal abnormalities had not been observed in the two probands with mutations in usher syndrome genes, but both were young children.

seven of the remaining eight probands carry at least one rare homozygous variant in genes one node away from a known hearing loss gene in ingenuity-curated biological pathways. these variants were not found in the unaffected family members from our cohort. these rare, homozygous, deleterious variants represent the most likely causative alleles in these probands. the variants can be viewed at https://variants.ingenuity.com/haraksingh-etal-2013-hhlb by invoking the ‘homozygous’ filter followed by the ‘hearing-relevant’ filter after the ‘rarity’ filter.

additionally, many genes were found containing recurrent predicted deleterious variants in at least two probands of our cohort. for example, under a dominant model,  <dig> genes contained recurrent variants in more than two probands and not in the unaffected members of families  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  these genes may represent additional recurrent candidates underlying the hearing loss in our set of probands. the results of this analysis and other adjustments to the genetic model can be explored at https://variants.ingenuity.com/haraksingh-etal-2013-hhlb. the dominant analysis results are obtained by moving the ‘homozygous’ and ‘hearing-relevant’ filters to the bottom of the cascade.

overall, these results indicate that strong candidates can often be found by exome sequencing of genomic dna of hearing loss patients. in other cases, larger numbers of candidates can be identified, the meaning of which is more difficult to distil.

genome-wide cnv mapping reveals several cnvs associated with snhl
in our second approach, we carried out a high-resolution, genome-wide cnv association study of snhl using  <dig> affected individuals, including the  <dig> isolated probands whose exomes were sequenced, and  <dig> controls. we mapped cnvs by acgh on the nimblegen  <dig>  m cnv array, the most sensitive array-based cnv detection platform available at the time  <cit> . we then called cnvs using two algorithms, nexus copy number  <dig>  and nimblescan  <dig>  . association testing was performed for genomic regions affected by cnvs including single loci, genes, and pathways, as well as for overall cnv load. we found an associated deletion on chromosome  <dig> encompassing the pdxdc <dig> gene  as well as other less significant cnv associations. additionally, we performed snp genotyping of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls using the illumina 1 m snp array and carried out a genome-wide association study  using our cases and a large set of publicly available controls. finally, we investigated whether there were combined effects of snv and indel mutations with cnvs in the same locus for the  <dig> individual probands. the latter two approaches did not yield significant results.

in total,  <dig>  cnvs were called by nexus , and  <dig>  cnvs were called by nimblescan . we define a unique cnv call as one that contains a unique pair of start and end coordinates.  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique cnvs were common to both the case and control groups as called by nexus and nimblescan respectively.

between two and  <dig>  cnvs were called by nexus , and between  <dig> and  <dig>  were called by nimblescan  in the individual genomes . it was found that the individual cases and controls have similar genome-wide cnv loads. . the nexus cnv calls tend to be much larger for the cases than the controls. there is an enrichment of cnv calls between 30–80 kb in the cases, as well as a higher relative frequency of nexus cnv calls that are greater than 100 kb. the nimblescan case and control cnv calls are generally similar in size .

cnvs were tested for association with the phenotype using the classic calculation option of the comparisons function in nexus  <dig> . smallest regions of overlap of the individual cnvs were used. the most significant association is an approximately  <dig>  kb  deletion on chromosome  <dig>  encompassing the first  <dig> exons of the pdxdc <dig> gene, the has-mir- <dig> micro rna, and the intergenic region between pdxdc <dig> and the upstream npip gene . some of the individual deletions extend far enough upstream to include the npip gene as well as the five 3’ most exons of the nomo <dig> gene which is further upstream. this region was previously reported in the database of genomic variants  and is thought to be the result of a duplication expansion in the human genome. the smallest region of overlap of the deletions is called in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls by both algorithms independently producing an odds ratio of  <dig>  . an additional  <dig> subjects and eight controls carry the deletion as called by a single algorithm. counting cnvs called by at least one algorithm, indicates that the deletion is present in  <dig> affected individuals and  <dig> controls producing an odds ratio of  <dig>  . the deletion is present in the same number of mexican cases and controls but significantly more east asian  and caucasian  cases than controls when considering cases where both algorithms called the cnv .figure  <dig>

we observed deletions encompassing the entire strc gene in seven cases and two controls as called by both algorithms, and in an additional control called by just the nimblescan algorithm. the deletions ranged in size from 70–239 kb with the smallest region of overlap being hg18; chr15: <dig> ,153- <dig> , <dig>  this is the only cnv that has previously been reported to be associated with mild to moderate hearing impairment in gjb <dig> mutation negative probands  <cit> .

each gene in the ncbi reference sequence database , including 10 kb up and downstream of the gene, was tested for association with the phenotype under the premise that different mutations in the same gene can lead to the phenotype. the frequency at which each gene overlapped a cnv by at least one base pair was calculated for the cases and controls. a fisher’s exact test was performed to determine whether the frequency differences between the cases and controls were significant. associations that either contained the lowest p-values  with the case frequency being higher than the control frequency, the lowest control frequency, or the most consistent trend from both cnv calling algorithms were the most functionally promising . as expected, the three genes in the deletion on chromosome  <dig>  found to be associated were among the top candidates in this second set of association tests. additionally, the otoa gene, known to be associated with snhl  <cit> , was found to be significantly associated in this cohort. the nbpf <dig> gene was found to be associated as well. this gene has no known function, but it is one of five genes that lies within the region of overlap of two previously discovered deafness associated genomic regions, dfnb <dig> and dfnb32

in order to test the hypothesis that different individuals may carry distinct mutations in a particular pathway which all result in the same phenotype, we carried out pathway association tests. each pathway in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  containing a gene previously known to be associated with hearing loss was tested for association in this cohort. a fisher’s exact test was used to determine if particular pathways were significantly enriched for cnvs in the cases versus the controls. no such pathway was found.

finally, the cnv load in the cases versus controls of the set of  <dig> genes known to be associated with snhl was tested. there was no significant difference in cnv load in the cases versus the controls for this set of genes.

combined effects of cnvs and point mutations in the dfnb <dig> locus may explain the hearing loss in several probands
deletions of the dfnb <dig> locus at chromosome 13q11-q <dig> have been described previously but are uncommon in most populations. this locus includes gjb <dig> and gjb <dig> encoding connexin  <dig> and connexin  <dig>  respectively, the two main connexins expressed in the cochlea. to date, four recessive gjb <dig> mutations have been reported . the two most common are del and del, which truncate gjb <dig> and affect expression levels of the gjb <dig> gene  <cit> . the other two are private. one deletes both gjb <dig> and gjb6
 <cit>  and the other  lies upstream from the gjb <dig> gene and does not affect either gene directly  <cit> .

in our study, we discovered two probands with heterozygous ~232 kb del deletions in the dfnb <dig> locus encompassing parts of the gjb <dig> and cryl <dig> genes and the putative regulatory region of the gjb <dig> gene. these probands carry additional heterozygous deleterious point mutations in the gjb <dig> gene as discovered by the apex array and sanger sequencing; the missense p.gln80pro and frameshift g.35delg mutations respectively. although we cannot determine from our data whether the deletion and point mutations occur in cis- or trans- configurations, it is likely that the compounded effects of a point mutation in gjb <dig> and a deletion of its putative regulatory elements explain the hearing loss in these probands. our cohort also contained one proband and one control who were carriers of a previously identified heterozygous ~309 kb del deletion, which was confirmed by our cnv analysis.

additionally, we discovered a novel smaller heterozygous deletion  in the dfnb <dig> locus that was called by at least one algorithm in  <dig> affected individuals and  <dig> controls. this deletion is ~60 kb upstream of the gjb <dig> gene and does not overlap any other genes. of the  <dig> cases with this deletion, nine carried an additional known heterozygous deleterious mutation in gjb <dig> that was determined by the arrayed primer extension  array and sanger sequencing. it is possible that this 2 kb deletion may overlap regulatory elements of the gjb <dig> or gjb <dig> genes. the combined effects of the deletion and deleterious point mutations may explain the hearing loss in these nine probands. the remaining cases may contain unidentified deleterious mutations on the non-deleted allele while the controls do not. alternatively, the 2–4 kb deletion may simply be a benign common cnv. with the current data set, we cannot resolve these possibilities.

discussion
using exome sequencing we have identified defects in a myosin ii gene, myh7b, as the likely contributors to hearing loss in one family. although several other myosin heavy chain genes have been previously implicated in hearing loss, the myh7b gene has not. however, there is indirect support for myh7b involvement in hearing including expression in embryonic mouse inner ear tissue  <cit> , expression in the primary auditory complex in humans, and the control of dendritic spine morphology, excitatory synaptic strength, and the actin cytoskeleton in rat neurons  <cit> . this, along with the segregation pattern, rarity, high quality, and location of the variants in functional domains strongly suggest that the predicted deleterious compound heterozygous mutations in myh7b cause the hearing loss in family  <dig>  the same sequence changes may also be responsible for the megalocornea phenotype in this family as it has been shown that myh7b transcripts are present in extraocular muscles from human, rat, and mouse, and in developing mouse eye skeletal muscle  <cit> . changes in extraocular muscle tension can produce significant changes in corneal topography  <cit> . interestingly, a single proband in our cnv cohort was found to harbor a deletion of the myh7b gene, as called by nexus. our results extend the role of cytoskeletal proteins in hearing and offer the possibility that mutations in the myh7b gene may constitute a rare cause of hearing loss.

exome sequencing of isolated probands revealed likely causative variants for hearing loss in five cases. interestingly, two of these probands had two homozygous rare mutations in known hearing loss genes. the rarity of such an occurrence suggests that it is plausible that both mutations may be required for hearing loss. for the remaining probands, multiple homozygous mutations in genes in hearing-relevant pathways and multiple heterozygous deleterious mutations were present. it is possible that hearing loss in these patients is due to rare deleterious homozygous mutations in novel hearing-associated genes, or to codominant, compound heterozygous, or non-allelic non-complementation of heterozygous mutations in distinct genes previously not known to affect hearing. despite extensive variant filtering and prioritization we are still left with unmanageable numbers of potentially causative mutations in many probands, which we were unable to further refine. complete distillation of the extensive findings of potentially causative mutations will require expression database analysis , functional assays in cell and animal models, meta-association analyses of integrated data from multiple genomic studies, and development of novel methods for discerning combinatorial effects of variants.

to our knowledge, this is the first high-resolution genome-wide cnv association study of hearing loss. we discovered novel cnv associations in both known hearing loss-associated genes and in novel candidates. of note, we found a strong association between a deletion encompassing part of the pdxdc <dig> gene and hearing loss. the function of this gene is unknown but it is widely and highly expressed in the cerebral cortex, including the primary auditory cortex, in newborn and adult mice  <cit>  . this work suggests a need to extend the types of variants typically analyzed in diagnostic hearing loss testing. furthermore, we have shown the importance of testing for multiple types of variants occurring in combination in individual probands, such as known deletions and point mutations in the dfnb <dig> locus. while these heterozygous mutations do not individually explain the phenotype, their compounded effects may well be pathogenic.

although we were unable to definitively identify the causative snhl variants for many probands in our cohort, we have found novel mutations that have credible potential to cause or contribute to hearing loss. maintaining accurate and comprehensive databases will be paramount in driving progress in molecular hearing loss diagnoses.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies have revealed three important aspects of identifying mutations associated with snhl. first, exome sequencing of families can reveal novel mutations segregating with snhl, although not in every instance. second, exome sequencing of a small number of isolated probands can reveal strong candidate hearing loss mutations, although in some cases it remains challenging to ascertain disease-causing mutations. third, analysis of cnvs can reveal novel mutations and loci associated with hearing loss. by employing both familial and association studies we have successfully identified rare and potentially private as well as more frequent variants in both novel and previously known candidate genes and loci. our results indicate that multiple strategies and study designs will be necessary to fully resolve the entire collection of mutations that underlie complex human disorders such as hearing loss. we anticipate that future advances in methods to determine the combinatorial effects of mutations will enable effective assessment of factors including long-range genetic interactions, and will facilitate integrated association analyses of panels of variants and specific phenotypes. at present however, studies like this continue to reveal novel aspects of the multifaceted and expansive genetic architecture underlying hearing loss.
