BACKGROUND
the extinct family ephialtitidae was considered as the second most stem group in the suborder vespina of hymenoptera. together with the most stem group of karatavitidae, they jointly constituted the superfamily ephialtitoidea  <cit> . in recent researches  <cit> , karatavitidae has been transferred to orussoidea to form the stem group of vespina, while ephialtitidae moved to stephanoidea as the stem group of apocrita. the stephanoidea was also treated as basal to evanioidea and ). ephialtitidae comprises two subfamilies: ephialtitinae handlirsh,  <dig> and symphytopterinae rasnitsyn,  <dig>  up to date,  <dig> genera with  <dig> species of ephialtitids have been described . the lineage is known to exist from the early jurassic to the early cretaceous. it was nearly cosmopolitan in distribution, described from many countries, such as kazakhstan, china, spain, germany, russia, mongolia, and brazil, while about 70% of reported species from kazakhstan  <cit> . although ephialtitids are most likely parasitoids of xylophagous insect  larvae based on their long ovipositors and often trans-striate mesonotum, details of their biology are uncertain.table  <dig>

in this paper, we describe two new genera with three species, acephialtitia colossa gen. et sp. nov., proephialtitia acantha gen. et sp. nov. and proephialtitia tenuata sp. nov., based on three well-preserved, nearly complete female specimens. these specimens were collected respectively from the early cretaceous yixian formation at liutiaogou and the late middle jurassic jiulongshan formation at daohugou, both are in inner mongolia, china. according to the accurate ar–ar and shrimp u–pb dating, the age of the yixian formation is considered as the early cretaceous   <cit> . the age of the daohugou fossil-bearing beds in the jiulongshan formation is the late middle jurassic   <cit> .

methods
examined taxa and terminology
the type fossil specimens studied are housed in the key lab of insect evolution and environmental changes, the college of life sciences, capital normal university in beijing, china. the specimens were examined and photographed, either dry or wetted with 95% ethanol, under leica mz  <dig>  dissecting microscope  with attached digital camera leica dfc <dig>  the specimens illustrated with the aid of camera lucida attached to the microscope. the figures are drawn by coreldraw  <dig>  and adobe photoshop cs <dig>  wing venation terminology is basically adapted from rasnitsyn & zhang  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
in this study, we used the xiphydriidae as an outgroup and thirteen taxa of suborder vespina as ingroups to carry out the phylogenetic analysis. twenty five characters were identified and scored for all taxa. the matrix used is that of rasnitsyn & zhang  <cit>  with addition of the new characters of ephialtitidae. a complete list of the taxa  and the character state matrix  used in the phylogenetic analysis are provided. the phylogenetic analysis was carried out in nona  <cit>  in conjunction with winclada  <cit> . tree searches were performed using an heuristic search method . character codings were set up by using nexus data editor  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with all characters unordered and of equal weight.

the first abdominal segment of apocritan has been incorporated into the thorax as the propodeum. the remaining abdomen, so called metasoma, is connected to this hybrid region via a narrow propodeal-metasomal articulation forming a “wasp waist”, which allows for preferable maneuverability in controlling its ovipositor  <cit> . by observing some ovipositing extant wasps, representatives shown in figure  <dig>  we categorize four different postures of oviposition highlighting how various wasps lay eggs by utilizing their propodeal-metasomal articulation and associated capability of controlling their ovipositors. these four typical postures of oviposition are as follows:  the metasoma is raised vertically above the head and mesosoma forming a “l” shape , and the long ovipositor is almost vertically inserted into the branches or flowers from the top of the “l” in order to lay eggs flexibly and accurately into hidden host larvae.  the metasoma is bent and parallel to the head and mesosoma forming a “=” shape , and the ovipositor is used to puncture the host’s gut wall, enter the hemocoel and then lay eggs.  the distal part of metasoma is bent downward from the basal part of metasoma forming a inverted “v” shape, the ovipositor and the main body forming an angle from less than 90° to about 90° , and the ovipositor is inserted into the flowers or plants to lay eggs into hidden host larvae;  the metasoma is not bent from the head and mesosoma, forming a linear “—” shape , and the ovipositor is bent downward into the flowers or plants to lay eggs. therefore, we believe that the propodeal-metasomal articulation is a very important factor, which influenced the posture of oviposition in apocrita.figure  <dig>

after studying the wasp waists of described fossil species of ephialtitidae, we identified three typical but different propodeal-metasomal articulations: the shape of the first metasomal segment varies from narrow and greatly elongate with distal end broader than the proximal end , to slightly broad with the sides straight and subparallel , then, to transversally broad with the sides nearly straight and subparallel . the family ephialtitidae was interpreted as a stem group of apocrita demonstrating the origin and transformation of the wasp waist characters of the apocrita  <cit> . our new results in figure  <dig> suggest that ephialtitidae is the sister group to all other apocrita  + )))), which add more details to the understanding and made possible to develop a hypothesis of the early evolution of higher hymenoptera. the hypothesis infers that the broad articulation between the propodeum and metasoma in ephialtitidae was passed on from a still more primitive family of karatavitidae   <cit> . this ground plan structure has gradually transformed into the more and more narrow and mobile articulation mechanism due to course of evolution of the family. different pathways of this transformation have been observed and interpreted as phylogenetically indicative.figure  <dig>

a key character of ephialtitidae, as well as of more primitive taxa , is that the first abdominal segment  is more or less convex  transversally but even  longitudinally . the first pathway of transformation of the metasomal attachment is demonstrated by the jurassic family of kuafuidae. this time both articulating foramens got narrower accompanied with the propodeum dorsum bent longitudinally . as a result, the narrow and mobile metasomal articulation appeared low on the propodeum , as is typical of the remaining apocrita, that is, the aculeata, ichneumonomorpha, proctotrupomorpha, and ceraphronomorpha . this pathway is shown as ① in figures  <dig> and  <dig> figure  <dig>

the second pathway of transformation is the pattern  basically retained in the extant family stephanidae , except that the articulatory foramen is often narrow here. the propodeal dorsum persists flat but becomes slanting towards its apex rather than horizontal . this pathway is shown as ② in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

some other ephialtitidae  demonstrate initial steps in a different direction. their articulatory orifices transformed in a disparate way so as the propodeal one retained wide whilst the metasomal base became narrow and hinged to the hind upper rim of propodeum, leaving membranous most of the hind face of propodeum. sclerotization of this membranous space from its lower sides towards midline is observable in some jurassic evanioids of the extinct family praeaulacidae . this sclerotization resulted in closure of the propodeum under the metasomal attachment which is the key synapomorphy of evanioidea . the third pathway is shown as ③ in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 



the above hypothesis suggests three separate pathways of the wasp waist transformation. concerning our considerations about various ovipositing postures of apocrita, this poses limitation only on the most sophisticated “=”-posture for both ephialtitid-stephanid and evanioid lineages, as well as on the “l”-posture for only the most basal versions of the ephialtitid mechanism . the ovipositing posture is evidently dependent on the ovipositor length. for instance, the “=”-posture correlates with the short ovipositor, in contrast to the “l”-posture which is useful only for the long one. this correlation raises a question about the ground plan length of the apocritan ovipositor. the basal apocritan family ephialtitidae consists of two subfamilies differing, among other characters, in the above character: the long ovipositor was claimed diagnostic of ephialtitinae, and the short one of symphytopterinae  <cit> . still more basal family karatavitidae has short ovipositor which might suggest that it is the ground plan character of ephialtitidae. however, the most plesiomorphic wing venation is known in ephialtitinae and not in symphytopterinae  <cit>  which makes possible a reversal nature of the short ovipositor in symphytopterinae. yet the recent findings of confirmed ephialtitinae with the short ovipositor  <cit>  resolve the puzzle and demonstrate that the short ovipositor was probably the ground plan character of both subfamilies of ephialtitidae.

on the parasitic larval feeding habit of apocrita
based on the information of table  <dig>  the larval feeding habit of apocrita is parasitic except for several groups having other feeding habits, such as predaceous , or phytophagous . we summarize the main hosts of the parasitic wasps, including coleoptera, lepidoptera, homoptera, hemiptera, blattodea, diptera, and hymenoptera in table  <dig>  in these host groups, lepidoptera  represent the most diverse and radiated species of plant-feeding insects, while coleoptera  is the second most diverse and radiated phytophagous insects  <cit> . more than  <dig> species of homoptera have been described in the world, all of them are phytophagous, feeding on plant sap. most species of heteroptera and blattodea are phytophagous, only a small part of them are predaceous. some dipterans  are pollinators for crop flowers, second only to the bees and wasps  <cit> . the siricoidea of hymenoptera always bore into the heartwood to lay their eggs so that their larvae will feed on phloem and xylem of trees  <cit> . overall, the feeding habit of most hosts of parasitic wasps is phytophagous. ephialtitidae were most likely parasitoids, which has been hypothesized based on their long and thin ovipositors that their hosts were xylophagous  <cit> . in particular, horntail  larvae are inferred to be the vespina  ground plan hosts  <cit> . however, the above inference that the ground plan ephialtitid ovipositor was needle-like thin but short makes the xylophilous hypothesis less reliably supported even though acceptable, for such ovipositor is characteristic now of parasitic wasps with almost any ovipositing habits.table  <dig>

on the diversification and extinction of ephialtitid wasps
based on the information and data summarized in table  <dig>  ephialtitid wasps existed from the early jurassic to the early cretaceous, while most of them during the jurassic. but, they declined drastically from the jurassic  to the early cretaceous . it is interesting to note that ephialtitid wasps radiated in the late jurassic but, probably became extinct after the early cretaceous.

the above considerations suggest addressing to profound changes in vegetation occurred in the cretaceous while seeking for a possible cause of demise of the ephialtitidae. it is well known that the non-marine earth transformed from the gymnosperm- to angiosperm-forested that time. early angiosperms, vascular flowering plants with seeds enclosed in an ovary, have many primitive features which are considerably different from extant angiosperms  <cit> . primitive angiosperms, archaefructus liaoningensis, archaefructus sinensis and archaefructus eoflora from the early cretaceous yixian formation, are now widely accepted as important fossil angiosperm plants  <cit>  leng and friis  <cit>  described the other angiosperm, sinocarpus decussates, from the same formation. these fossil angiosperms provided important information about early angiosperms which co-existed with many gymnosperm and other plants in the same ecosystems  <cit> . during the early cretaceous, early angiosperms were usually less popular in the composition of the flora than other plants. based on literature data, researchers believe that the earliest unequivocal remains of angiosperms are generally thought to be pollen grains in the early hauterivian   <cit> , and the age when angiosperms appeared in the fossil record and rose to ecological dominance has been considered as the period of the barremian–cenomanian interval, from about 130– <dig>  ma  <cit>  .

unfortunately, the hypothesis of ephialtitid extinction caused by changes in the food plants of their insect hosts, even though attractive is not consistent, with the geochronological aspect of the fossil record. indeed, the vegetation became angiosperm-dominated towards the end of the early cretaceous . at the same time, ephialtitidae appeared as a rare group since the very beginning of cretaceous and lost the fossil record after the aptian . this pattern correlates rather with changes in the hymenopteran fossil record which demonstrates gradual decrease of a number of other predominantly jurassic taxa  and a sudden emergence of many others   <cit> . it is of particular interest that the faunistic transformation might start even before the end of jurassic . these observations imply a different hypothesis, that demise of ephialtitidae, along with the other taxa listed above, has been driven by competition with numerous new taxa appeared just before or/and soon after the j/k boundary. in particular, the abundant cretaceous xylophilous baissinae look like the important competitors of ephialtitidae, and the same is likely correct for the cretaceous ichneumonoidea  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a thorough review of the various types of the propodeal-metasomal articulation of apocrita suggests that the wide articulation between the propodeum and metasoma in basal ephialtitidae was passed on from a still more basal family of karatavitidae and provided three separate pathways of transformation of the wasp waist. in addition, the demise of ephialtitid wasps lagging behind the flourishing of angiosperms suggests that ephialtitid extinction driven by competition with numerous new taxa  appeared just before or/and soon after the j/k boundary, rather than the transformed from the gymnosperm to angiosperm-forested led to shortage of food sources for hosts of the larvae of ephialtitids.
