BACKGROUND
the serine/threonine kinase cdk <dig> is a regulator of transcription through its association with the mediator complex  <cit> . this complex was originally identified as an activity that was required to allow rna polymerase ii to perform regulated transcription in vitro. purification has revealed it be a large multi-protein complex with varying composition. the presence of a submodule containing cdk <dig> and its protein partner cyclin c has been proposed to be a mechanism to regulate mediator activity, responsible for both activation and inhibition of transcription through phosphorylation of either the c terminal domain of rna polymerase ii  or of gene-specific transcription factors. the yeast orthologues of cdk <dig>  and cyclin c  were identified genetically as suppressors of defects caused by truncation of the ctd, consistent with a role in regulation of transcription. microarray analysis suggests that yeast lacking srb <dig> show altered expression of around 3% of genes  <cit> . orthologues of cdk <dig> are apparent in all eukaryotes, but the mechanisms of regulation are not well defined. in s. cerevisiae, proteolysis of the cyclin c orthologue has been proposed in response to stresses such as oxidative stress  <cit> , but this has not been reported in other systems.

in mammalian cells cdk <dig> activity has been implicated in regulation of growth through its overexpression in tumour cells  <cit> , as well as in development. cdk <dig> plays an important role in the notch signalling pathway as recruitment of cdk <dig> to the promoter of a developmentally regulated gene  causes hyperphosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the notch transcription factor, promoting its degradation and leading to subsequent down regulation of transcription of hes <dig>  <cit> . cdk8-dependent regulation of transcription factor stability has also been reported in s. cerevisiae where phosphorylation of ste <dig> and gcn <dig> by srb <dig> promotes their degradation  <cit> . consistent with a role in development, cdk <dig> shows tissue specific expression during zebra fish development and disruption of genes encoding components of the mediator sub-complex containing cdk <dig> cause developmental defects in c. elegans, drosophila and arabidopsis  <cit> .

previous reports have implicated cdk <dig> activity in development of dictyostelium amoebae  <cit>  which feed and proliferate as single cells but, upon starvation, undergo a developmental life cycle  <cit> . starving cells start to secrete pulses of camp that acts as a chemoattractant for the surrounding cells which aggregate to form a multicellular organism. this aggregate undergoes a series of morphogenetic changes leading to the generation of a fruiting body in which around 80% of the cell differentiate into spore cells while the remaining cells differentiate into stalk cells to support the spore head above the substratum. dictyostelium strains in which the gene encoding cdk <dig> have been disrupted grow poorly in shaking suspension and fail to aggregate unless supplied with exogenous pulses of camp  <cit> . the cells also fail to express a number of genes associated with early development, including the gene encoding the adenylyl cyclase  responsible for camp generation during aggregation, which could explain the failure to aggregate. we further reported that for the cdk8-null strain generated in our lab  pulsing with exogenous camp could rescue the early aggregation defect. if these cells were then plated on a surface, they went on to form aberrant structures with a defect in the ability to generate mature spore cells. this defect could be rescued by expression of cdk <dig> but not by a kinase-dead version, implicating the kinase activity in this failure of development  <cit> . however, although early aggregation defects were identical, cdk8- cells generated in a different genetic background did give rise to viable spores  <cit> .

here we report that microarray analysis revealed genome duplications in the cdk8-hl cells, which may explain the phenotypic differences in different genetic backgrounds. subsequent regeneration of the strain in a parent lacking detectable genomic duplications confirms the defects in aggregation and an important role for cdk <dig> in spore cell differentiation, although milder than initially reported. comparison of the protein expression profile of parental and the new strain of cdk8-  cells revealed potential targets for direct regulation by cdk <dig> which will facilitate analysis of the targets of cdk <dig> in dictyostelium which lead to defects in growth and development.

RESULTS
microarray analysis of cdk8-hl cells
in order to investigate differences in the reported phenotypes of strains containing disruption of the cdk <dig> gene in dictyostelium and in light of the recent realisation that many laboratory strains of dictyostelium contain genomic duplications  <cit> , we investigated whether the cdk8- cells previously isolated in our laboratory, cdk8-hl, and their parent, ax2p, contained genomic duplications. this analysis was carried out by microarray to compare the relative copy number of genes in genomic dna isolated from these strains and from the strain ax2k which is free of detectable duplications  <cit> . comparison of both cdk8-hl and its parental ax <dig> line  with ax2k  <cit>  revealed a large duplication on chromosome  <dig> in both cdk8-hl and ax2p . this analysis also revealed a further duplication on chromosome  <dig> within cdk8-hl cells, which was not present in the parent ax2p. a duplication on chromosome  <dig> in the region duplicated in ax2p and its derivative, has previously been reported for another strain of dictyostelium, ax <dig>  <cit> . comparison of the parental ax2p gdna with gdna extracted from strain ax <dig> showed that the novel chromosome  <dig> feature in the former strain spans the previously described  <dig> kb duplication in ax <dig>  and extends approximately a further  <dig> kb on one side of it. in view of the chromosomal duplications identified in the original cdk8-hl strain, independent null strains were generated in an ax <dig> background, using the ax2k cells with no detectable duplications  <cit> . three independent strains were identified in which the cdk <dig> gene had been disrupted and all showed identical phenotypes to each other. in order to determine whether the phenotypes described for the original cdk8-hl strain were dependent on the genome duplications we carried out a phenotypic analysis of the newly derived cdk8- <dig> cells. they showed identical defects in growth in shaking suspension to the original strain . they also failed to form aggregates on starvation, but this defect could be rescued by exogenous pulses of camp, as reported for the original strain, and showed similar defects in transcription of early developmental genes such as a failure to switch off expression of cprd and a failure to induce expression of early developmental genes such as pkac, aca and cara on starvation   <cit> . these results suggested that the early developmental phenotype was not influenced by the genome alterations in the original cdk8-hl strain.

late developmental phenotype of the cdk8- <dig> strain
in order to examine the newly generated cdk8- <dig> strain for the presence or absence of the late developmental phenotype, cells were suspended in kk <dig> buffer and pulsed with  <dig> nm camp every 5mins for 6hrs, before being harvested, washed and plated on kk <dig> agar. unlike the cdk8-hl strain, the cdk8- <dig> cells formed phenotypically normal fruiting bodies, although culmination occurred 3-4hrs later than in the ax2bsr control strain . ax2bsr was created by random insertion of the vector designed for disruption of the cdk <dig> gene into the genome of ax2k. upon culmination, the spia gene  was expressed at similar levels in both the cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr strains .

viability of cdk8- <dig> spores
in order to investigate whether the spores generated by the cdk8- <dig> strain were viable, their ability to germinate after heat and detergent treatment was tested. fruiting bodies formed by the mutant and control strains were harvested and disaggregated. an equal number of spores from each strain were exposed to detergent and heat treatment in order to destroy any non-viable spores and undifferentiated amoebae. the number of surviving spores from each strain that were capable of germination was determined by spreading dilutions onto bacterial lawns and counting the resultant colonies.

this analysis revealed that cdk8- <dig> spores were less viable than those of the ax2bsr strain. whilst 98% of spores from the control strain were able to germinate after heat and detergent treatment, this was true for only 40% of cdk8- <dig> spores . this defect in spore formation phenotype is much milder than that of the previous cdk8-hl strain in which virtually no resistant spore cells were formed  <cit> . this data suggests that, although the phenotype was exaggerated in the duplication-containing background, there is a consistent defect in spore cell formation in the absence of cdk <dig> 

requirement for kinase activity of cdk8
the cdk8- <dig> strain was transformed with an extrachromosomal vector to drive expression of an epitope tagged version of cdk <dig>  from a semi-constitutive actin <dig> promoter  and a version containing a point mutation  to create a kinase deficient form of the same protein   <cit> . the expression of each cdk <dig> protein was confirmed by western blot . expression of the myc-cdk <dig> protein in cdk8- <dig> cells resulted in rescue of all the observed growth and developmental phenotypes. in contrast, the cdk8- <dig> strain grew at a rate comparable to the cdk8- <dig> strain and did not form aggregates upon starvation . the cdk8- <dig>  spores exhibited a similar viability  to those of the ax2bsr strain  implying that expression of the myc-cdk <dig> protein complemented the late developmental phenotype . in contrast, the cdk8- <dig> spores exhibited a similar viability  to those of the cdk8- <dig> strain . these observations implied that the phenotypes observed in the cdk8- <dig> strain were directly attributable to a loss of cdk <dig> kinase activity.

overexpression of pkac in cdk8- <dig> cells
the early developmental phenotype of the cdk8- <dig> cells suggested a potential gene target for regulation by cdk <dig> activity. the camp dependent protein kinase  enzyme is vital for both aggregation and formation of spore cells . many aggregation-deficient strains which can be rescued by exogenous pulses of camp can also be rescued by restoring expression of the catalytic subunit of pka, pkac. as no expression of pkac could be detected in cdk8- cells , it was hypothesised that this may be responsible for the defect in aggregation. in order to address this question, the pdxa plasmid which expresses the pka-c protein with an n-terminal flag-tag was transformed into the cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr to create the cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr strains. cell extracts from these strains were analysed by western blot to confirm expression of the 75kda flag-pka-c protein in both strains .

both strains were developed alongside the parental ax2bsr and cdk8- <dig> strains. it has previously been shown that over expression of pka-c results in more rapid completion of the developmental cycle  <cit> . as the ax2bsr strain was observed to achieve culmination more rapidly than the parental ax2bsr strain  it was concluded that a functional pka-c protein was being expressed. however, expression of this protein in the cdk8- <dig> strain did not result in a rescue of the cdk8- <dig> aggregation defect  suggesting that low levels of pkac expression were not solely responsible for this phenotype.

identification of proteins with altered expression levels in cdk8- cells
in order to identify targets regulated by the cdk <dig> protein, whole-cell extracts from vegetatively growing cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr strains were analysed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis and gels were stained with colloidal blue. subsequent analysis of the protein spots found that the vast majority of protein features showed equal staining intensities in both strains . this characteristic was used to normalise the staining intensity of each gel against a standard. more detailed analysis found that two protein features were reproducibly altered in the cdk8- <dig> strain in comparison with the ax2bsr strain . a protein approximately 42kda  in size was present at higher levels in the cdk8- <dig> strain, whilst a smaller protein of 32kda  was consistently expressed at lower levels in the mutant strain .

these proteins were both possible targets of cdk8-dependent regulation so were each excised from the gel and sequenced by mass spectrometry. this approach identified p <dig> as 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase . this metabolic enzyme is involved in catalyzing the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate in the tyrosine catabolic pathway  <cit> . the p <dig> protein was identified as the protein product of gene ddb_g <dig>  blast searches against the ncbi database revealed that this protein shares a large amount of similarity with short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases from a number of different species. it was thus named sdr <dig> , while the gene encoding it was named sdra.

expression of the hpd and sdra genes
as cdk <dig> is a known transcriptional regulator, it was investigated whether the altered abundance of the hpd and sdr <dig> proteins were mirrored by alterations in the expression of the hpd and sdra genes. rna was extracted from ax2bsr and cdk8- <dig> cells that were growing vegetatively or had been developed on kk <dig> agar for 3hrs. northern blot analysis of these samples indicated that hpd mrna was present at equal levels in vegetatively growing cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr strains and could not be detected in either strain after three hours of development . examination of sdra mrna levels revealed that this transcript was present at higher levels in the ax2bsr cells than in cdk8- <dig> cells during vegetative growth . as with hpd mrna no transcript could be detected after 3hrs of development in either strain. these observations implied that the reduced abundance of the sdr <dig> protein in the cdk8- <dig> strain may be the result of reduced expression or stability of the sdra transcript, while the altered level of hpd was not due to a direct effect on mrna levels.

discussion
the original cdk8-hl strain exhibited a complex phenotype which included defects in growth and aggregation. when developed under permissive conditions, the block upon aggregation was relieved but the resultant fruiting bodies were highly defective with no mature spores  <cit> . all of these defects could be complemented by expressing wild type cdk <dig>  but not a kinase dead version, from its endogenous promoter, so were dependent on cdk <dig> activity. as a consequence of these observations, it was proposed that cdk <dig> may function as a regulator of cell differentiation. a potential role for cdk <dig> later in development was also suggested by a reduction in the proportion of cdk <dig> associated with a high molecular weight complex late in development in response to an increase in extracellular camp  <cit> .

microarray analysis of genomic dna revealed duplications in the genome of the cdk8-hl strain. the analysis strongly suggests that the cdk8-hl strain contains a large duplication of approximately  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and another smaller duplication of approximately  <dig> kb on chromosome  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> is the largest of the dictyostelium chromosomes and a number of previous reports have suggested that it may be intrinsically unstable: in the nc <dig> strain originally isolated by john bonner and maintained in vegetative growth for many decades, the chromosome is maintained as two smaller fragments  <cit> . similarly the ax <dig>  but not the ax <dig> strain, possesses a perfect inverted repeat of  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> that has been proposed to be the result of a 'breakage-fusion-bridge' cycle  <cit> . the putative chromosome  <dig> duplication detected in the cdk8-hl strain is a similar size and occurs in a similar region of the chromosome as the ax <dig> duplication. a number of other reports of chromosomal abberations in this region of the genome imply that it may be a hotspot for rearrangements  <cit> . the frequent occurrence of duplications in many strain backgrounds suggests that the segmental duplication on chromosome  <dig> in the cdk8-hl strain was not caused by genome instability resulting from loss of cdk <dig> function.

due to the cdk8-hl chromosomal abnormalities it was decided to create a new cdk <dig> disruptant. characterisation of the newly generated mutant strain indicated that it had similar growth and aggregation defects as had previously been observed in the cdk8-hl strain  <cit> . expression of myc-cdk <dig> but not myc-cdk8kd rescued the growth and early development defects of the cdk8- <dig> strain indicating that these phenotypes were a direct consequence of an absence of cdk <dig> kinase activity. pka is a central regulator of dictyostelium development and its activity has been found to be essential to the expression of a number of pre-aggregative genes including aca and cara  <cit> . as expression of pkac, aca and cara could not be detected in cdk8- cells  <cit>  it was suggested that cdk <dig> may exert its function upstream of pka, so a flag-tagged pka-c protein was over-expressed in both the cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr strain. this approach results in constitutively active pka and has been used to rescue aggregation defects in a number of strains including those deficient in aca, erk <dig> and amib  <cit> . flag-pka-c protein expression in the ax2bsr strain resulted in rapid development; a phenotype reported to be a consequence of high pka activity  <cit> , consistent with the production of active protein. however, although expressing similar levels of flag-pka-c as detected by western blot, the cdk8- <dig> strain exhibited similar defects as the cdk8- <dig> strain implying that defects in aggregation were not merely a consequence of defects in pka regulated gene expression. it is possible that the levels of pka-c expression were not high enough to rescue the defect, despite its expression from a multicopy extrachromosomal vector using a strong promoter.

the cdk8- <dig> aggregation deficiency is comparable to that observed in a strain deficient in amib  <cit> . these phenotypic similarities might be expected as amib has been identified as a dictyostelium homologue of med <dig>  a component of the same mediator module as cdk <dig>  <cit> . however, the observation that constitutive pka activity rescues the amib-  <cit>  but not the cdk8- <dig> aggregation defect is interesting as it implies that amib and cdk <dig> operate in different signalling pathways. such an observation would not be unprecedented as the med <dig> and cdk <dig> proteins have been shown to play subtly different roles during drosophila development  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out that the precise level of overexpression of pka-c is important in rescuing the phenotype.

although the phenotypes of the cdk8- <dig> and cdk8-hl cells appeared identical with regard to growth and early development, this was not the case during later development. it was previously observed that the cdk8-hl strain formed aberrant fruiting bodies which contained virtually no viable spores. this late developmental defect was accompanied by a decrease in expression levels of the spore-specific transcript spia  <cit> . in contrast, the newly generated cdk8- <dig> strain produced phenotypically normal fruiting bodies in which the spia transcript was expressed at normal levels. microscopic examination of disaggregated cdk8- fruiting bodies revealed that the strain was capable of producing morphologically normal spores . however, these spores exhibited only 40% viability when compared to those formed by the ax2bsr control strain. endogenous expression of a myc-cdk <dig> protein rescued this defect in spore viability indicating that it was a consequence of loss of cdk <dig> function. these data suggested that cdk <dig> is involved in dictyostelium spore cell differentiation in cells that are presumed to lack the genomic duplications present in the cdk8-hl strain. however, the role is more subtle than when these duplications, and perhaps other unknown smaller-scale mutations, were present.

a 2d-page comparison of the cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr strains was unable to detect any differences in the abundance of the vast majority of proteins. this is consistent with microarray analysis in which it was observed that srb <dig> was involved in the regulation of only 3% of s. cerevisiae genes  <cit> . despite the similarities between the cdk8- <dig> and ax2bsr proteomes, two proteins were consistently observed to be present at different levels in the cdk8- <dig> strain. one of these proteins was abnormally abundant in cdk8- <dig> cells and was identified as the dictyostelium homologue of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase . the other protein, named sdr <dig> exhibited homology to the short chain reductase proteins and was found to be present at unusually low levels in the cdk8- <dig> strain.

short chain dehydrogenases are a large family of nad or nadp-dependent oxidoreductases working on a variety of substrates with short carbon chains. for example alcohol dehydrogenases break down alcohols which could be toxic and are also involved in generating aldehydes and ketones during various biosynthetic processes. in bacteria and yeast this enzyme can be used to synthesize alcohol in anaerobic conditions. it is not possible to predict the substrate of the dictyostelium sdr <dig> from sequence homology. the sdr <dig> protein has been found to become associated with phagosomes during maturation  <cit>  and expression of the sdra gene was also found to be upregulated as part of the dictyostelium response to legionalla infection  <cit> . hpd is a metabolic enzyme involved in catalyzing the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to  <dig>  dihydroxyphenylacetic acid  as part of the pathway to degrade tyrosine and phenylalanine  <cit> . in dictyostelium, the hpd protein has been found to associate with the centrosome  <cit>  and has been implicated in phagosomal maturation  <cit> . microarray analysis revealed that the hpd gene is upregulated in the environmentally resistant aspidocyte cell type that is formed by dictyostelium in response to stress  <cit> . both of these proteins are catabolic enzymes found associated with phagosomes and are implicated in stress responses. this would fit for a general role for cdk <dig> in regulating stress responses, consistent with data from s. cerevisiae showing regulation of cyclin c in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . microarray analysis of s. cerevisiae deficient in srb <dig>  showed altered expression of around 3% of yeast genes and half of these are genes derepressed during nutrient starvation  <cit> , again consistent with a general role for cdk <dig> in mediating metabolic responses.

despite the difference in protein levels, the hpd mrna was present at similar levels in the two strains. however the sdra transcript was found to be significantly less abundant in cdk8- <dig> cells than in the ax2bsr strain. this suggested that the lower levels of the sdr <dig> protein in the mutant cell line may be due to defects at the transcriptional level whereas the effect on hpd levels is post-transcriptional. the established role for cdk <dig> in transcriptional regulation via the mediator complex would suggest that the sdra gene is a candidate for direct transcriptional regulation by cdk <dig> in dictyostelium.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis has confirmed the importance of cdk <dig> at multiple stages of dictyostelium development, although the severity of the defect in spore production depends on the genetic background. potential targets of cdk8-mediated gene regulation have been identified in dictyostelium which will allow the mechanism of cdk <dig> action and its role in development to be determined.
