BACKGROUND
identifying molecular features that vary with chronological age has critical implications for our understanding of aging and the development of age-associated diseases. a number of previous studies have performed systematic investigations of the relationship between age and gene expression in various human tissues, including t cells  <cit> , whole blood  <cit> , peripheral blood mononuclear cells   <cit> , brain  <cit> , and muscle tissue  <cit> . although very few individual genes with age-associated expression have been identified across studies or tissues  <cit> , similar gene functions/pathways have been reported. for instance, pathway analyses of age-associated genes identified an enrichment of immune function and inflammation genes in various mixtures of blood cells  <cit> . other aging-associated pathways/processes found to be enriched in blood as well as brain and muscle tissues include rna processing  <cit>  and chromatin remodeling  <cit> , while mitochondrial pathways  <cit>  and more specifically the oxidative phosphorylation/electron transport pathway  <cit>  were detectable in studies of skin, brain, and muscle tissues. however, interpretation of these findings is limited by small sample sizes and often heterogeneous cellular composition of the samples investigated. currently, there is a lack of well-powered transcriptomic studies of aging using homogeneous cell samples.

cd4+ t cells and cd14+ monocytes are excellent cell types for transcriptomic studies of aging in humans. t cells and monocytes can be isolated from an easily accessible tissue , and both have known roles in the development of age-related diseases. t cells are well known to exhibit numerous functional impairments with advanced age and have been implicated in the age-dependent decline in immune function, commonly known as immunosenescence  <cit> . to date, the largest aging transcriptomic study of cd4+ t cells included  <dig> individuals, aged  <dig> – 81 years, from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging. comparison of t cell expression profiles from individuals less than 65 years of age to those age  <dig> and older revealed  <dig> genes associated with age   <cit> . monocytes have also been shown to exhibit phenotypic and functional changes in the elderly  <cit> , and are key cells of innate immunity and major contributors to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and degenerative diseases  <cit> . to our knowledge the effect of aging on the monocyte transcriptome has not yet been investigated.

previously, we purified cd14+ monocytes from the peripheral blood of  <dig>  participants of the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis . we measured both genome-wide gene expression and dna methylation in these purified monocyte samples using microarrays, and identified cytosine-guanine dinucleotides  whose degree of methylation was associated with cis-gene expression   <cit> . given that dna methylation can vary with age  <cit> , we also investigated the relationship between age and dna methylation in the  <dig>  mesa monocyte samples  <cit> , and identified  <dig>  cpgs whose degree of methylation was associated with age and cis-gene expression   <cit> . however, it remains unknown to what extent age-related variations in the methylome may mediate the overall effect of age on gene expression.

in response to these uncertainties, here we present a comprehensive analysis of age and gene expression in the cd14+ monocyte samples from  <dig>  mesa participants ranging in age from  <dig> to 94 years. additionally, we present an analysis of age and gene expression in circulating cd4+ t cells from a subset of  <dig> mesa participants. this cohort study offers the unique opportunity to 1) better understand the effect of aging on gene expression in cd14+ monocytes and cd4+ t cells, 2) compare the aging transcriptome measured in two cell types from the same individuals, 3) investigate cpg methylation as a potential mediator of age-associated variations in the transcriptome, and 4) characterize the relationships between chronological age-associated gene expression and a clinical measure of vascular age, pulse pressure.

RESULTS
the overall study design and results are summarized in figure  <dig>  and the population characteristics are described in additional file 1: table s <dig> figure  <dig> study design and results summary. a) cd14+ monocytes were purified from  <dig>  peripheral blood samples by magnetic bead selection, and gene expression levels were measured using microarray. age-associated expression  was detected for  <dig>  genes, which were further analyzed using the indicated in silico approaches to identify and investigate potential age-related pathways. results support a potential transcriptomic decline in ribosomal protein synthesis machinery, as well as declines in oxidative phosphorylation and autophagy gene expression with age. measures of dna methylation and pulse pressure were incorporated to investigate dna methylation as a potential mediator for the effect of age on gene expression, and to prioritize age-associated gene expression for potential relevance to vascular age. b) cd4+ t cells were purified in a subset of the peripheral blood samples by magnetic bead selection, and gene expression levels were measured using microarray. age-associated genes  were identified, revealing  <dig> genes with expression significantly associated with age in both monocytes and t cells from the same individuals. no pathways were significantly  enriched among age-associated genes in t cells; however, suggestive evidence was observed for the ribonucleoprotein complex and immune response pathways.



transcriptomic profiles associated with age in  <dig>  monocytes samples
transcriptomic profiling of cd14+ monocytes using microarrays  revealed  <dig>  expressed genes, of which 25% had expression significantly  associated with chronological age  after adjusting for appropriate biological and technical covariates including race, gender, study site, and estimates of residual sample contamination with non-targeted cell types . the effect size of a ten-year difference in age for individual gene expression was modest . the majority of the associations with age remained significant in the “disease free” , sex- and ethnic-specific subgroups .

gene set enrichment analysis  <cit>  identified the ribonucleoprotein complex, mitochondrial ribosome, and oxidative phosphorylation pathway genes enriched among age-associated genes. after stratifying by the effect direction of age on expression, the genes with expression negatively associated with age were found to be enriched with ribosomal/translation and mitochondrial/oxidative phosphorylation genes . in contrast, genes with expression positively associated with age were enriched with pathways relating to regulation of transcription, the cytoskeleton, protein phosphorylation, and response to insulin.

co-expression network analysis
to identify consensus networks of genes with coordinated expression profiles associated with age, we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis  <cit>  , combined with a stability analysis , and examined an expanded set of  <dig>  genes associated with age at a more liberal fdr threshold of ≤  <dig>  . six mutually exclusive gene network modules were identified, labeled as colors: ‘black’, ‘blue’, ‘turquoise’, ‘brown’, ‘yellow’, and ‘green’. network modules ranged in size from three to  <dig>  genes, and had significant module eigengene  associations with age with p ranging from  <dig> ×10− <dig> to  <dig> ×10− <dig> . genes assigned to the same module had moderately to strongly correlated expression . to better understand the relationships between modules, we examined the correlations between eigengenes of each module, and found a very strong negative correlation between the ‘blue’ and ‘turquoise’ module eigengenes .figure  <dig> co-expression network modules associated with chronological age. six mutually exclusive gene network modules with coordinate gene expression profiles associated with chronological age were identified in  <dig>  monocyte samples , ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  genes. for each module , the partial correlation between age and the module eigengene is shown ; covariates included race, sex, site of data collection, and residual sample contamination with non-targeted cells. below each module is the number of genes assigned to the module, and the direction of expression association with age; network modules discussed in further detail include the ‘black’ module , and the ‘blue’ and ‘turquoise’ modules . the significance of the module eigengene association with age is denoted as: * p <  <dig>  , and ** p ≤ 1x10− <dig> 



gene set enrichment analysis revealed significantly  enriched pathways within two of the six modules, relative to all monocyte expressed genes . the  <dig> genes assigned to the ‘blue’ module, all with expression negatively associated with age, were enriched with 1) ribonucleoprotein complex genes  and 2) mitochondrion genes . the largest gene network module, the ‘turquoise’ module, was assigned  <dig>  genes which were significantly enriched with nuclear lumen genes, many of which with known roles in rna splicing and the regulation of transcription.table  <dig>

results from gene set enrichment analysis are presented  for co-expression network modules with significantly enriched gene ontology  terms . no significant enrichment was observed among the ‘black’, ‘brown’, ‘yellow’, or ‘green’ network module genes; background genes included all  <dig>  genes with expression detectable in  <dig>  cd14+ monocyte samples.

the other four co-expression network modules  were found to have weakly to moderately correlated eigengenes  which were positively associated with older age. no significantly enriched pathways were detected within these four modules with a false discovery rate of 5%; however, there were pathways enriched with nominal significance among these modules, including insulin signaling , immune response , and regulation of apoptosis .

autophagy-related gene expression
autophagy is a degradation pathway that utilizes double-membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, to engulf long-lived proteins, damaged organelles, and invasive pathogens, and to transport these cargos to the lysosomes for degradation  <cit> . in the aging field, impaired autophagy is considered one of the principal determinants of cellular aging, which is supported by in vitro and animal study findings that autophagy declines with age  <cit> . however, studies of autophagy and age in humans are sparse.

one of the most significant age-gene expression associations we observed in monocytes from  <dig>  individuals was with mcl <dig> . mcl <dig>  a known inhibitor of autophagy and apoptosis, is a member of the bcl- <dig>  family, which includes many other proteins known to regulate autophagy and apoptosis  <cit> . the positive relationship between mcl <dig> expression and age tends to be linear across the range of ages  in this population . we confirmed an age-associated increase in mcl <dig> mrna expression in a subset of the population using rna sequencing technology . mcl <dig> gene expression was also significantly correlated with mcl <dig> protein expression measured in a subset of the population using western blot for .

mcl <dig> was assigned to the co-expression network module whose eigengene was most significantly associated with age . in addition to mcl <dig>  the ‘black’ module contained two other genes with expression positively associated with age – tsc22d <dig>  and cebpd , which encode transcription factors involved in the suppression of inflammation and apoptosis  <cit> . while a common regulator for these three ‘black’ module genes has not been identified, the limited literature available points towards cytokines such as il- <dig>  and il- <dig> in the up-regulation of ‘black’ module gene expression, possibly through the activation of stat proteins  <cit> . notably, stats  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 5a were also found in our list of genes that increase expression with age .

given the limitation of the wgcna network analysis , and the known role for mcl <dig> in the inhibition of autophagy  <cit> , we next examined the relationship between age and expression for key autophagy genes disregarding network module membership. the associations of age and gene expression, as well as the previously characterized protein-protein interactions  <cit> , are shown for key autophagy genes in figure  <dig>  among the well-known regulators of autophagy within the bcl- <dig> family  <cit> , age was positively associated with expression of inhibitors of autophagy , and negatively associated with expression of activators of autophagy . negative effects of age on gene expression were also observed for genes which encode proteins critical for autophagosome formation  <cit> , including autophagy machinery genes atg <dig>  atg <dig>  atg <dig>  and gabarapl <dig> . additionally, we observed a positive effect of age on the expression of autophagy inhibitors belonging to the pi3k/akt signaling pathway , while negative effects of age were observed for a pi3k/akt signaling pathway gene important for autophagy activation  <cit> , ampk . however, exceptions to the apparent age-dependent transcriptional decline of autophagy gene expression were also observed, such as increasing expression of pro-autophagy genes  <cit> , becn <dig>  and ulk <dig>  with older age.figure  <dig> age-associated expression pattern for the bcl- <dig> family and other key autophagy genes suggest autophagy declines with age. the ‘black’ co-expression network module gene - mcl <dig> , and other key genes  encoding autophagy machinery and autophagy inhibitors/activators  are shown, with edges representing previously characterized protein-protein interactions . color denotes the direction and significance resulting from the association of age and gene expression in  <dig>  cd14+ human monocyte samples, adjusting for race, sex, study site, and residual cell contamination with other cell types.



the protein networks that regulate autophagy and apoptosis are highly interconnected, and crosstalk has been observed, particularly among bcl- <dig> family members  <cit> . however, an overall transcriptional decline in apoptosis gene expression with age was not apparent, as other key regulators of the apoptotic pathway, such as pro-apoptotic casp <dig>  casp <dig>  and foxo <dig>  had increasing expression associated with older age .

in vitro and animal studies have reported a decline in autophagy with age  <cit> ; however, to our knowledge, only one other publication has reported an age-associated decline in expression of autophagy genes, which was carried out in a small number of human brain tissue samples  <cit> . overall, these findings for major components of core autophagy machinery and upstream regulators provide evidence for a transcriptional decline in autophagy gene expression with age in human monocytes. the identification of key genes contributing to a decline in autophagy are of great interest, as pharmacologic activation of autophagy has been linked with increasing lifespan in animal models, including mice  <cit> . further, dysfunctional autophagy is now widely implicated in pathophysiological processes of many age-related diseases such as cancer, alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . however, longitudinal studies are necessary to validate the age-related transcriptional decline of autophagy gene expression in human monocytes, and to investigate the relationship between these age-related patterns and the development of age-associated diseases.

oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis machinery gene expression
according to the mitochondrial theory of aging, mitochondria are among the key players contributing to the aging process, whose dysfunction is linked with aging  <cit>  and age-related diseases  <cit> . consistent with previous findings from multiple human tissues and across species  <cit> , our data revealed a pattern of decreasing expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  genes with age in monocytes, particularly among genes within the ‘blue’ network module . the ‘blue’ module genes were also enriched with ribonucleoprotein complex genes. upon examining ‘blue’ module genes for previously characterized protein-protein interactions , two sub-networks were identified: one relating to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and the other composed of ribonucleoprotein complex genes. the majority of the ribonucleoprotein complex genes were ribosomal protein synthesis machinery genes.figure  <dig> protein functions and interactions between co-expressed genes assigned to the ‘blue’ network module. in  <dig>  monocyte samples, older age was associated with lower expression of  <dig> co-expressed genes assigned to the ‘blue’ network module,  <dig> of which  have experimental evidence for interaction with other ‘blue’ module genes . color denotes gene membership to gene ontology  pathways enriched in the ‘blue’ module relative to all monocyte expressed genes , including the electron transport chain/oxidative phosphorylation pathway  and ribonucleoprotein complex pathway  – comprised of protein synthesis machinery genes from the mitochondrial ribosome , the ribosome , and rna processing genes . genes relating to other cellular processes  include mitochondrial protein import genes  and dna damage response genes ; ‘blue’ module genes without reported protein-protein interactions are not shown .



to better understand the relationship between age and global expression of oxphos and ribosomal protein synthesis genes, we examined the associations between age and expression of all oxphos , ribosome , and mitochondrial ribosomal genes  expressed in monocytes, disregarding network module membership. overall, we found almost two-thirds of the expressed oxphos genes  and ribosomal genes  had expression negatively associated with age . among the mitochondrial ribosomal genes, 80% had expression negatively associated with age  . using western blot to measure the protein levels of one mitochondrial ribosomal protein  in a subset of our samples , we found protein levels of mrps <dig> tended to correlate with mrna expression levels .

the declining expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes in monocytes is consistent with previous findings across species  <cit> , and from previous transcriptomic studies of aging in human muscle  <cit> , and brain  <cit>  tissues. mitochondrial dysfunctional has been widely reported with aging  <cit>  and many age-related diseases  <cit> . a major finding of this work is the coordinated down regulation of many oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis machinery genes with age in monocytes. however, the potential upstream mechanisms responsible for down-regulation of oxphos and protein synthesis genes with age are unclear.

potential drivers of an apparent age-related decline in oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis machinery gene expression
six genes with reported regulatory roles for mitochondrial gene expression  <cit>  were detectable in our monocyte samples , two of which had expression significantly and negatively associated with age . however, there were no detectable transcriptional changes with age for pcg-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, which indirectly up-regulates expression of nuclear oxphos genes, mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery, and mitochondrial protein import genes  <cit> .

to identify potential transcriptional regulators for the coordinated expression of oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis machinery genes observed in monocytes, we next looked for enrichment  <cit>  of transcription factor binding sites  among genes assigned to the ‘blue’ co-expression network module. no tfbs were significantly  enriched among ‘blue’ module genes compared to all monocyte expressed genes. the ‘turquoise’ module on the other hand, which was strongly and negatively correlated with the ‘blue’ module , contained a large number of genes  which were enriched with binding sites for over  <dig> different transcription factors compared to all monocyte expressed genes . further, the ‘turquoise’ module included  <dig> genes with known roles in regulation of transcription , including a number of transcription factors with expression increasing with older age  and chromatin remodelers which increased with older age  . future studies may benefit from our identification of several chromatin remodeler and transcriptional modifier genes with expression profiles strongly correlated with an apparent coordinated transcriptional decline of key genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis.

paradoxically, inhibition of autophagy should reflect an anabolic state and increasing rates of protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> ; however, in the aging monocyte transcriptome we observed a potential transcriptional decline in autophagy, and a concomitant decline in oxphos and protein synthesis gene expression with age. intriguingly, a decline in ampk activity with age could potentially explain this paradox, given the dual role of ampk to activate autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . similar to the decline in ampk activity that has been previously reported in aged mice  <cit> , here, we reported decreased expression of the regulatory subunit of ampk . these results provide clues for further investigations of the role of ampk dysfunction in aging, and identify potential transcriptional regulators of an age-related decline in oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal protein synthesis machinery gene expression.

epigenomic regulation of age-associated gene expression
to investigate dna methylation as a potential regulator of the aging transcriptome, we performed lookups using the list of expression-associated methylation sites  that we recently reported from the same  <dig>  monocyte samples  <cit> . we identified 48% of age-associated genes  harboring ems. methylation profiles were both negatively correlated  and positively correlated  with gene expression profiles. using mediation analyses to investigate dna methylation as a potential mediator for the effect of age on gene expression, 17% of age-associated genes  were identified harboring cpg sites whose degree of methylation significantly mediated  the effect of age on gene expression , including a similar percentage of genes from each of the three age-associated pathways: five oxphos genes ,  <dig> ribosomal genes , and five autophagy genes  . the majority of the mediation effects had similar directions of effect as the overall effect of age on gene expression .table  <dig>

cpgs whose degree of methylation significantly associated with age , cis-gene expression , and was predicted to mediate  the total effect  of age on gene expression. results include only the most significant mediating cpg identified per gene for oxidative phosphorylation genes , ribosome genes  and autophagy genes , and are sorted first by pathway, then by the significance of the mediation effect . the direct effects of age on gene expression not supported to be mediated by methylation are also shown . analyses included  <dig>  cd14+ monocyte samples; partial correlations  were adjusted for sex, race, study site, residual contamination with non-targeted cells, and microarray chip effects.



different from previous studies of the aging transcriptome that did not have measures of dna methylation, our concurrent transcriptomic and methylomic profiling of the same batch of monocytes allowed us to detect genes harboring cpg sites with methylation profiles which significantly mediated the associations between age and gene expression. these potentially functional cpgs are enriched in predicted enhancer regions compared to all cpgs measured by microarray  <cit> , suggesting that dna methylation of enhancers could play a role in the regulation of gene expression with age. however, we cannot rule out the reverse causality of age-associated expression affecting methylation profiles or uncontrolled  variation resulting in the correlation between methylation and gene expression. additionally, the majority of the age and gene expression associations  remained significant after adjusting for cpg methylation, suggesting that regulators other than the measured cpg methylation likely contribute to the relationship between age and gene expression. moreover, further investigations of other potential drivers for gene expression changes with age are warranted.

transcriptomic profiles associating with pulse pressure
to see if age-related changes in gene expression may also reflect vascular age, we examined the relationships between age-associated gene expression profiles and a surrogate of vascular age, pulse pressure. of the  <dig>  genes associated with age  in the  <dig>  monocyte samples,  <dig> genes were also associated with pulse pressure , after adjusting for age and appropriate biological and technical covariates . the gene most significantly associated with pulse pressure was ptger <dig> ), which had increasing expression associated with higher pulse pressure . additionally, the increasing expression of mcl <dig>  a known inhibitor of autophagy  <cit>  and one of the most significant associations we detected with age in monocytes, was also independently associated with higher pulse pressure.

transcriptomic profiles associated with age in 423 t cell and monocyte samples
we carried out transcriptomic profiling of cd4+ t cell samples using microarrays  for a subset of the mesa samples with transcriptomic data in monocytes , and detected  <dig>  genes expressed in both t cell and monocyte samples . a comparison of the effect of age on gene expression in t cells and monocytes is shown in figure  <dig>  which reveals  <dig> genes with expression significantly associated with age only in t cells,  <dig> genes associated with age only in monocyte samples, and  <dig> genes with age-associated expression in both the t cell and monocyte samples . the majority  of the genes detected with age-associated expression in the subset of  <dig> monocyte samples were also significantly  associated with age in the full sample of  <dig>  monocytes, with similar effect directions observed for all genes .figure  <dig> comparison of the effect of age on gene expression in t cells and monocyte samples. the correlation between age and gene expression is shown in t cells , compared to monocytes  from  <dig> individuals, including all  <dig>  genes expressed in both t cells and monocytes. color indicates genes with expression significantly associated with age  in t cells  or monocytes , both t cells and monocytes , or neither t cells nor monocytes ; association analyses were adjusted for race, sex, study site, and residual cell contamination with non-target cells.



age-associated genes identified in the subset of  <dig> monocyte samples were enriched with ribonucleoprotein complex genes, similar to results from the expanded sample size of monocytes. after stratifying by the effect direction, the genes with expression negatively associated with age were enriched with ribonucleoprotein complex and mitochondrion genes, while genes with expression positively associated with age were enriched for cellular biosynthetic processes . the down-regulated mitochondria genes included atp synthase complex genes  and electron transport chain genes  which are key genes for oxidative phosphorylation.

no pathways were significantly  enriched among genes with age-associated expression in t cells; however, there was suggestive enrichment for the ribonucleoprotein complex among genes with expression negatively associated with age, and for the immune response pathway among genes with expression positively associated with age . providing further evidence for a transcriptional decline of ribosomal protein synthesis genes with age in t cells, the majority  of the ribonucleoprotein complex genes with expression profiles negatively associated with age in monocytes were also negatively associated with age in t cells . however, the overall decline of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression with older age that was detected in monocytes was not detectable in t cells.

these results, from a large number of purified t cell and monocyte samples from the same individuals, identify only a small number of genes with transcriptomic profiles associated with aging in both cell types, supporting the idea that some age-related changes may be cell-type specific. however, the potential decline in protein synthesis machinery gene expression observed in both cell types, and previously reported in human blood leukocytes  <cit>  and brain tissue  <cit> , further support the hypothesis that some transcriptomic changes are conserved to varying degrees across cell types.

limitations of the study
several limitations of the study should be noted. our investigation included adults aged  <dig> to 94 years; therefore, these results may not be applicable to younger populations. also, our primary analysis used microarrays to measure gene expression rather than rna sequencing, which may have missed low abundance genes. the cross-sectional nature of the investigation also limits inferences for the associations of gene expression with chronological age. longitudinal analyses are necessary to confirm the effect of age on expression of identified genes and gene networks. we also acknowledge that the analyses of cpg methylation as a potential mediator of the effect of age on gene expression should be interpreted with caution since statistical mediation does not differentiate correlation from causation. lastly, some of the age-associated transcriptional differences we observed may not reflect differences in protein levels or protein activity, although we have quantified protein levels using western blot for two of our transcriptional signals.

CONCLUSIONS
in this transcriptomic study of purified monocytes from a large, multi-ethnic and mixed gender population, older age appears to be associated with a transcriptomic decline in ribosomal protein synthesis machinery, oxidative phosphorylation, and autophagy pathways. the ability to detect a large number of biologically plausible gene expression changes support the use of cd14+ monocytes, a readily accessible cell population, as a model for further investigations of human aging, including the potential decline of autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis with age. our data also provides clues to the potential drivers of these transcriptomic changes with age, such as chromatin remodeler genes and dna methylation. further functional work is required to investigate the causes and consequences of these mrna expression alterations with age.

our sample size of purified t cells from a subset of the population is also the largest reported to date, which allowed sufficient power to detect age-sensitive genes, and provided suggestive evidence for transcriptomic alterations in ribosomal protein synthesis machinery and immune response pathways with age. the full list of age-genes identified from either cd4+ t cells or cd14+ monocytes harbors many strong candidate genes for future studies of the aging process. in designing such experimental studies one may want to consider that there may be tissue- or cell-specific changes with age, although some patterns of aging are likely similar between different human tissues.
