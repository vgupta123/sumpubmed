BACKGROUND
community acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  infections are increasing worldwide  <cit> . although the emergence is concurrent, genetically distinct clones have been reported from different continents  <cit> . in the united states, two clones, usa <dig> and usa <dig> have been associated with the majority of ca-mrsa infections  <cit> . however, usa <dig> is currently being reported as the predominant cause of both adult and pediatric ca-mrsa infections in many states  <cit> . at texas children's hospital  in houston, texas, we have observed a continuous increase of ca-s. aureus infections, predominantly ca-mrsa, in a prospective surveillance study initiated in  <dig>  <cit> . skin and soft tissue infections  represented 94%; 58% of ssti patients were hospitalized. we have also reported an increased number and severity of invasive cases, e.g. complicated pneumonia, osteomyelitis, pyomyositis, myositis and severe sepsis syndrome associated with the predominance of clone usa <dig>  <cit> . similar observations have been described at other institutions across the united states  <cit> . recent reports suggest that usa <dig> is more virulent than other mrsa strains  <cit> . usa <dig> is genetically related to the nosocomial mrsa strain col, which emerged in the 1960s in europe following the introduction of methicillin. both of these strains are likely descendents of a methicillin-susceptible ancestral strain  <cit> .

approximately 75% of the ca-s. aureus strains at tch are mrsa; 95% of these are usa <dig>  in contrast to the homogeneity of ca-mrsa, ca methicillin-susceptible s. aureus  from the same population are more heterogeneous; usa <dig> represented approximately 25% of these strains between 2000– <dig>  <cit> . we continue to note a greater absolute increase in the number of ca-mrsa isolates, being virtually all usa300-mr, compared with ca-mssa among children evaluated at tch .

at the time of this writing, the complete genomes of eleven mrsa and mssa clinical strains, of both community and hospital origin, plus a bovine s. aureus strain have been deposited in the genbank database. recently, the genome sequence of a multi-resistant usa300-mr isolate  from an abscess of an hiv-positive intravenous drug user was reported  <cit> . we present the sequence of a usa300-mr isolate from an otherwise healthy pediatric patient  and compare it to the genomes of fpr <dig> and a usa300-ms isolate from tch. we postulate that comparison of the genomes of usa300-mr and usa300-ms will provide clues to the enhanced ability of usa300-hou-mr to spread and cause infections among children compared to other s. aureus clones circulating in houston.

RESULTS
features of the usa300-hou-mr genome
the usa300-hou-mr genome is  <dig> , <dig> bp in length and was annotated to encode  <dig> proteins,  <dig> trnas ,  <dig> ribosomal rna operons and  <dig> non-coding rnas . a circular representation of the sequenced genome is shown in figure  <dig>  to identify dna regions unique to usa300-hou-mr, two-way blastn was performed against each of the other complete staphylococcal genomes . usa300-hou-mr carries the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec  type iva methicillin resistance cassette. in addition to sccmec iva, the strain also contains a ca.  <dig> kb region of dna from  <dig> to  <dig> that is unique only to usa300-hou-mr, usa300-fpr <dig> and to s. epidermidis atcc <dig>   <cit> . this region maps immediately downstream of sccmec and the entire element  is flanked by an is431mec transposase gene and a possible transposase gene. the region downstream of sccmec carries genes encoding an arginine deiminase operon, a crp family transcriptional regulator, an apc family arginine/ornithine antiporter, and an arginine repressor. in usa300-fpr <dig>  this region is called acme, for arginine catabolic mobile element  <cit> . downstream of the arginine element we also annotated genes encoding a universal stress protein, a lysophospholipase, a possible s-adenosyl-l-methionine -dependent methyltransferase, an abc superfamily atp binding cassette transporter, a p-atpase copper transporter, a possible lipoprotein and an integrase. the abc transporter proteins had top blast hits to nickel, dipeptide or oligopeptide transporters in other species and it was annotated as an oligopeptide transporter by diep, et al.  <cit> . clustalw analyses of the individual components of these transporters indicated a clustering of nickel-specific sequences with those from usa300-hou-mr . thus, we believe that this transporter is likely involved in nickel acquisition. interproscan, pfp and psortb, secretomep <dig>  were used to augment the annotation data obtained by blastp and cdd. based on this analysis, the sccmec-acme region encodes four non-classically secreted proteins and three other extracellular proteins. the region also encodes a possible endonuclease, possible trna ligases, rna polymerases and a primase. we also identified a number of orfs that were not annotated in usa300-fpr3757; these were hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins.

pathogenicity islands and prophages
more than fifteen different pathogenicity islands have been identified in the sequenced s. aureus genomes  <cit> . sapis are mobile genetic elements that carry about half of the known s. aureus toxin or virulence factor genes, and while strains contain different combinations of the islands, no strain appears to carry more than one copy of each type  <cit> . usa300-hou-mr contains six, sapi <dig>  sapim <dig>  sapi6Δ, vsaα, vsaβ, and vsaγ. these encode enterotoxins, extotoxins and serine proteases as well as leukotoxin, hemolysin, exfoliatin, and epidermin . mw <dig>  another community-acquired mrsa isolate contains the same complement of islands, while, col, mu <dig> and rf <dig> contain six islands each, though in different combinations.

usa300-hou-mr carries two complete prophage sequences, φslt-usa <dig> and φβc-usa <dig>  prophage remnants also occur within pathogenicity island sapi <dig>  the φslt-usa <dig> sequence is 98% identical to the  <dig> bp φslt sequence  <cit> , excepting gaps greater than  <dig> bp. these gaps represent regions in usa <dig> encoding a helicase and virulence-associated protein e, two dna polymerases, and two prophage regulatory proteins. the prophage carries the panton-valentine leukocidin genes luks-pv and lukf-pv. by phylip analysis, the φslt-usa <dig> sequence is most similar to the prophages in mw <dig> and clinical strain a <dig>   <cit>  . as observed for φslt-a <dig> and φ-pvl, the φslt-usa <dig> attachment site lies within a conserved hypothetical protein gene  <cit> . the second prophage, φβc-usa <dig>  is very similar to β-hemolysin-converting prophages identified in jh <dig>  jh <dig>  mrsa <dig>  mssa <dig>  mu <dig>  mw <dig>  n <dig>  newman, and nctc <dig> . it is most similar to those found in jh <dig>  jh <dig> and n <dig>  in usa <dig>  this prophage encodes staphylokinase, chemotaxis inhibitory protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor; the order of these genes places it in immune evasion cluster  type b  <cit> . unlike col, usa300-hou-mr lacks the l54α-like bacteriophage. as a result, the glycerol ester hydrolase, or geh lipase gene, which is disrupted in strains carrying the l54α-like prophage, is intact and presumed to be expressed.

plasmids
two plasmids were detected in usa300-hou-mr . the  <dig>  kb plasmid, pusa01-hou, is identical to plasmid pusa <dig> in usa300-fpr <dig>  it encodes a replication protein plus several conserved hypothetical proteins. the second larger plasmid, pusa300-hou-mr, appears to be a mosaic of parts of three plasmids: pn <dig> from s. aureus n315; psr <dig> from s. aureus strain 01a103; and pserp from s. epidermidis rp62a. the plasmid carries two recombinase genes and three is <dig> transposase genes that may have played a role in fusion of the three elements. the replication region appears to be derived from pnf315b. pusa300-hou-mrsa encodes resistance to beta-lactam, macrolide, aminoglycoside, streptothricin  and bacitracin antibiotics, consistent with the resistance pattern observed for usa300-hou-mr , with the exception of nourseothricin. the streptothricin acetyltransferase and 3',5'-aminoglycoside transferase genes are adjacent and map between two is <dig> transposase genes; long inverted repeats  flank these genes. the repeats are most similar to the inverted repeats found in is <dig> from s. epidermidis strain sk <dig>  though similar repeats are found on a number of plasmids from both s. aureus and s. epidermidis. thus, it appears that this region constitutes a compound transposon that could also be part of a larger element carrying the bacitracin transporter genes. a ca.  <dig> nt repeat  also occurs within the is <dig> transpose genes at ca.  <dig>  and  <dig> kb on the map. pusa300-hou-mr also encodes a cadmium transporter cadd and regulator cadx, and at least three additional predicted transcriptional regulators including blai and blar.

comparison of usa300-hou-mr and usa300-fpr3757
we identified  <dig> insertions/deletions  of greater than four bp between usa300- fpr <dig> and usa300-hou-mr . the most significant difference between the two strains is the location of a  <dig>  kb insertion. in usa300-fpr <dig>  this region is inserted at nt  <dig> , <dig> between a biotin carboxylase carrier protein gene, accb, and the elongation factor p gene efp. in usa300-hou-mr, this same  <dig> kb segment of dna is inserted at nt  <dig>  within the snoa gene at the beginning of the staphylococcal nuo-like operon, which encodes an nadh dehydrogenase  <cit> . the  <dig> kb segment is also found in col, at the same location as in usa300-fpr <dig>  and in mrsa <dig> between two bacteriophage protein genes. there is no homology flanking the insertions sites for this element and there are no obvious recombination sequences or repeats within the segment. the first gene in the segment encodes a frameshift of an issa <dig> transposase. the frameshift occurs in a poly adenine tract so sequence variation through slipped-strand mispairing is possible. six of the proteins encoded by the  <dig> kb segment may be non-classically secreted proteins. also encoded are a possible lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, a cell division protein, a gtp-binding protein, a replication protein and a possible actin-binding protein.

achp, conserved hypothetical protein

an insertion of  <dig> bp in usa300-hou-mr but not in usa300-fpr <dig> occurs within a staphylococcal conserved hypothetical protein between  <dig> and  <dig>  this insertion is a duplication of flanking sequence and maintains the reading frame of the protein. another difference identified is a  <dig> bp region in usa300-fpr <dig>  within the repeated region of the igg binding protein gene; again, these are absent from usa300-hou. additional short deletions in usa300-hou-mr also occur within intergenic regions. also of note is a frameshift in the gene encoding an arac family transcriptional regulator in usa <dig> . this frameshift is not observed in any of the other sequenced s. aureus strains. in addition, we identified a frameshift in the cell wall anchor protein gene  not reported in the annotation of fp <dig> 

comparison of the two usa <dig> sequences revealed  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and two four bp. deletions . we also discovered  <dig> sequencing errors in the fpr <dig> sequence. fifty-five of the snps map within orfs, while  <dig> map within intergenic regions  and  <dig> map within rrna sequences. twenty-one of the changes within reading frames are synonymous,  <dig> are non-synonymous and  <dig> caused frameshifts. two of the snps may explain differences in antibiotic susceptibility. one, a t  to c  change in the gyra gene causes a leucine to serine change at amino acid  <dig>  the serine-containing gyra protein confers resistance to ciprofloxacin , while leucine confers the wild-type, susceptible phenotype   <cit> . a second snp presumed to be involved in fluoroquinolone resistance maps within the topoisomerase iv parc gene. here, the usa300-hou-mr amino acid  <dig> is the wild-type serine, while usa300-fpr <dig> has a tyrosine that confers resistance  <cit> . three non-synonymous snps occur within the igg binding protein a. snps in intergenic regions could affect gene regulation: a four base deletion at  <dig> , <dig> would place a sara binding motif closer to the saru promoter and could affect its transcription .

we compared the usa <dig> snps to all other sequenced s. aureus strains . for  <dig> of the snps, the other strains had the usa300-hou-mr allele, while in  <dig> the allele was identical to fpr <dig>  for the remaining snps, the other strains showed both alleles, with some being triallelic.

comparison of usa300-hou-mr and of usa300-hou-ms
we generated a draft sequence of the methicillin susceptible strain, usa300-hou-ms, using the  <dig> life sciences pyrosequencing technology  <cit> . this strain is susceptible to all the antibiotics tested except penicillin . the sequences were assembled into  <dig> contigs with a total contig length of  <dig>  mb. we observed  <dig> snps between the hou-mrsa and mssa strains . we also identified two regions of dna that are found in usa300-hou-mr but not in usa300-hou-ms. in contrast, we observed only one region in the ms strain not present in the usa300-hou-mr strain. this  <dig> bp contig had a short dna match  to several staphylococcal sequences and a partial protein match  to a transport accessory protein. the sequences missing from usa300-hou-ms included the sccmec and acme regions . a second region not found in usa300-hou-ms  includes a large number of staphylococcal conserved hypothetical proteins . four of the proteins encoded by this region may be secreted . also encoded are a possible lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, a cell division protein, atp- and gtp-binding proteins, a replication protein, a possible secreted actin-binding protein, a possible ornithine carbamoyltransferase and a possible histidinol dehydrogenase.

we surveyed other sequenced staphylococcal genomes using tblastx for the presence of orfs that were homologous to proteins encoded by the regions of usa300-hou-mr that were missing in the mssa strain. these are shown in additional file  <dig>  with the exception of a few matches in the mw <dig> genome, the region from  <dig> to  <dig> seems to encode proteins unique to usa300-mr. this region also encodes four hypothetical and six conserved hypothetical proteins; several of these, although present, were not annotated in usa300-fpr <dig>  as previously discussed, this region may encode several secreted proteins. though the arginine deiminase dna region is unique to usa <dig> and to s. epidermidis atcc  <dig>  genes encoding homologues of the proteins are found elsewhere in the usa300-hou-ms genome and in most of the complete staphylococcal genomes. proteins weakly similar  to the nickel transporter were found in all staphylococcal genomes but this is likely due to generalized matches to other abc transporter subunits. in contrast, the nickel transporter proteins are most homologous to proteins encoded by staphylococcus haemolyticus. the proteins encoded by the region between  <dig> and  <dig> are also encoded by the genomes of two nosocomial mrsa strains, col and mrsa <dig>  these were not found in the ca isolate mw <dig> 

usa300-hou-ms does not carry plasmid pusa300-hou-mr but it does carry a  <dig> kb plasmid  that encodes resistance to beta-lactams and to cadmium . it also carries genes that are predicted to encode a bacteriocin and its associated immunity protein. the region from  <dig> to  <dig> on pusa300-hou-ms is nearly identical  to nts  <dig> to  <dig> of plasmid pn315b. this corresponds to the region encoding the beta-lactamase gene and its regulators, blar and blai, and a tn <dig> invertase and recombinase. in addition, this same region on pusa300-hou-ms is 96% identical to nts. 7615– <dig> on pus300-hou-mr. thus, pusa300-hou-ms also appears to be mosaic. we also identified sequences homologous to pusa <dig> on two contigs that were  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length, respectively. since pusa <dig> has now been sequenced twice, we did not attempt to complete the pusa <dig> sequence in the ms strain.

comparison with other completely sequenced staphylococcal genomes
we used mauve  <cit>  to align the sequences of the seventeen completed sequenced staphylococcal genomes  the alignment revealed that usa <dig> clusters with col, nctc <dig>  and newman strains and that there are at least four clades of mrsa circulating. this clustering suggests that not all methicillin resistant s. aureus strains are intimately related further suggesting that different clones have given rise to groups of methicillin strains.

discussion
because of the rapid and continuing increase of the prevalence of ca usa <dig> strains at tch, we initiated the sequencing of two typical isolates from pediatric patients. during this time, diep et al.  <cit>  reported the sequence of usa300-fpr <dig>  usa300-hou-mr revealed significant differences from usa300-fpr <dig>  though usa300-fpr <dig> was chosen as a highly resistant isolate, usa300-hou-mr, a purely community-acquired strain, harbours a large plasmid encoding multiple antibiotic and cadmium resistance. the mosaic composition of plasmid pusa300-hou-mr representing three different staphylococcal plasmids points toward significant genetic exchange between staphylococcal isolates and species. among the numerous antibacterial resistance genes found on the plasmid, the conferred resistance to bacitracin, a common constituent of topical over-the-counter ointments used to treat or prevent cutaneous infections, is most intriguing. in contrast to other mr strains, the cadmium resistance genes were found on a plasmid and not on the chromosome. genome-wide alignments revealed that not all mrsa are tightly clustered.

several indels between usa300-hou-mr and usa300-fpr <dig> were identified. the majority of the indels were within repeat regions or rrnas, though a  <dig> kb segment was located in different regions of the two genomes. in usa300-fpr <dig>  the region is inserted between two genes. in usa300-hou-mr, the segment interrupts an operon  that has been implicated in susceptibility to thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein  <dig> . bayer et al.  <cit>  have shown that interruption of this operon reduces the susceptibility of s. aureus to tpmp- <dig> in vitro. resistance to tpmp- <dig> may allow us300-hou-mr to cause more serious disease by evasion of platelet-mediated killing in the blood stream. usa300-fpr <dig> has an additional repeat within the gene encoding the igg binding protein a, so it is possible that igg binding protein is subject to structural variation. we also identified nine snps within this gene. this may suggest that the igg binding protein undergoes significant variation, possibly in response to the host.

two prophage were identified, one carrying the pvl genes and the other an hemolysin converting phage carrying the staphylokinase, chemotaxis inhibitory protein and staphylococcal complement inhibitor genes. usa <dig> lacks a copy of prophage l54a. the gehd lipase, whose gene contains the prophage attachment site, is likely to play a role in colonization events.  <cit> .

snp analysis revealed  <dig> non-synonymous, non-conserved differences between the strains. some of these may affect protein function. two of these, one in gyra and one in parc, are consistent with antibiotic susceptibilities reported in table  <dig>  the snp analysis also revealed a number of sequencing errors in the fpr <dig> sequence.

to further our understanding of the evolution of the usa300-hou-mr strain, we created a draft sequence of an ms isolate from tch. this revealed two regions of the mr strain not found in the ms strain. it is likely that the progenitor ms strain acquired these regions  by recombination to become usa300-hou-mr. we propose that usa300-hou-ms first acquired the arginine deiminase region plus the cassette chromosome recombinase genes  from a strain similar to s. epidermidis atcc <dig>  this is based on the observation that the ccrab genes in usa300-hou-mr are 95–100% identical to those found near the arginine deiminase region in s. epidermidis atcc <dig>  the sccmec was likely acquired in a separate event from another mrsa, or from a mr-s. epidermidis strain, via ccrab recombination within the repeats flanking the arginine deiminase region  <cit> . us300-hou-ms lacks a probable nickel abc transporter that is linked to acme in usa300-mr. it is possible that increased intracellular stores of nickel in usa300-hou-mr could contribute to virulence by enhancing the activity of the nickel-dependent urease.  <cit> . the ms strain also lacks a copy of the p-atpase copper transporter gene; such transporters have been shown to be involved in virulence in listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . another potential virulence factor revealed by comparison of the mr and ms strains is a possible secreted actin binding protein.

we used a relatively new predictive tool, secretomep <dig> , to identify non-classically secreted proteins  <cit>  since it is not possible to predict the function of most of these proteins by blast analysis. we found  <dig> high scoring genes predicted to encode non-classically secreted proteins in usa300-hou-mr . if some of these are indeed secreted then they may be candidate virulence factors for future study.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative analyses have revealed that usa300-mrsa is highly similar to some mrsa strains suggesting that the differences in pathogenesis are due to subtle changes rather than to large-scale acquisition of virulence factor genes. significantly, however, is the difference in plasmid content and antibiotic susceptibility profiles between the two usa <dig> isolates. the presence of a large multidrug resistance plasmid in a community-acquired isolate is unexpected. the combination of sanger sequencing and  <dig> data allowed us to economically derive the complete sequence of usa300-hou-mr and ms. future sequencing of additional usa <dig> isolates will further characterize the genotypic variation in this clone. with exception of the antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the phenotypic results of the genotypic variation have yet to be discovered.
