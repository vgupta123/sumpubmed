BACKGROUND
pseudorabies, caused by pseudorabies virus, has leaded to significant economic losses to the pig industry in many countries. pseudorabies is a porcine infectious disease that can be effectively controlled using gene deletion marked vaccines and serum monitoring, enabling differentiation of vaccinated from infected animals . however, in  <dig> an outbreak of pseudorabies affected chinese pig herds that had been vaccinated with the standard prv bartha k <dig> strain . it is now clear that the outbreak was caused by an emergent prv variant . as a support for this finding, the widely used prv bartha k <dig> strain was shown to be incapable of providing complete protection against this new prv variant in several experimental studies . thus, a more efficacious vaccine is perceived as a necessary tool to help affected herds revert to prv virus negative status.

to develop an effective vaccine, gene deletion mutants were generated from the new prv strain and evaluated for protection efficacy. although live vaccine candidates based on ge, ge/gi, or tk/ge/gi gene deletion mutants are assumed to be highly protective, the safety issues of these preparations have to be demonstrated by lengthy testing . alternatively, inactivated version of vaccine from the same mutants are promising to provide clinical protection as well based on relevant data about inactivated bartha strain.

in this study, la-ab, a ge deleted mutant of the emerging prv strain ah02la, was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome clone. a vaccine utilizing this mutant was evaluated with and without adjuvant in regard to its ability to provide clinical protection and reduce virus shedding after lethal challenge.

methods
cells and viruses
bhk- <dig> cells  and chicken embryo cells   were prepared using standard methods. the prv bartha k <dig> strain was kindly provided by professor ping jiang of nanjing agricultural university. virus cultures and stocks were prepared using cecs or bhk- <dig> cells before at -70 °c. virus titers were determined by tcid <dig> on bhk- <dig> cells following a standard protocol. viral dna extraction and transfection of plasmid, virus or bacterial artificial chromosome dnas were performed as described previously  <cit> .

plasmid and bac manipulation
the mini-f transfer vector pha2-puc19-h1-h <dig> was constructed as described  <cit> . plasmid and bac dnas were isolated using commercial kits  following the manufacturer’s instructions. next, restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of prv bacs was conducted using the restriction endonucleases bamh i, kpn i, pst i and sph i and digestion conditions recommended by the supplier . electrocompetent e.coli cells  were obtained commercially . e.coli gs <dig> was made electrocompetent using published protocols . electroporation was performed to transform viral or bac dna following established methods .

pcr and sequencing
a pair of primers  was designed from reference sequence  to amplify sequences of gi gene with isolated prv ah02la strain dna as template. these primers were also used for sequencing gi gene . to obtain the ge deletion, overlap pcr was conducted with two pairs of primers, Δge tv overlap <dig> and Δge tv overlap <dig> . briefly, with prv ah02la dna as template, two pcr reactions were performed separately with the above two primer pairs. next, the pcr products were gel purified to serve as templates in another pcr reaction with primers Δge tv overlap <dig> f and Δge tv overlap <dig> r to produce a fragment for ge deletion mutant generation. thus the generated mutant, consists of upstream sequences, the intact gi gene, part of ge gene, and downstream sequences . finally, the primers prv homo-1 f and prv homo-2r  <cit>  were used to amplify the repairing viral dna with the prv ah02la dna as template.table  <dig> primers for pcr or sequencing

multistep growth kinetics
multistep growth kinetics of parental ah02la, ge deletion la-ab, and repair ah02lar viruses were tested on bhk- <dig> cells following methods as described  <cit>  on monolayers  of bhk- <dig> cells with a multiplicity of infectionof  <dig> . three independent experiments were conducted and one-way anova  was employed to identify significant differences.

ld <dig> determination for prv ah02la strain
to determine the ld <dig> of the virulent prv ah02la strain, the virus  was serially diluted with dmem to 10- <dig>  10- <dig>  10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  twenty-five 77-day-old piglets were randomly divided into five groups. piglets in each challenge group were inoculated intranasally with 1 ml diluted virus of different titers. animals were observed for additional fourteen days. the number of piglets that died in each group was recorded to calculate ld <dig> using the karber method.

construction of prv bac and deletion mutants
the prv bac was constructed from an isolate of the emergent prv variant following published methods   <cit> . briefly, after cotransfection of ~ <dig>  μg prv ah02la strain dna and ~4 μg pha2-puc19-h1-h <dig> dna, mini-f recombinant viruses with green fluorescence were purified to obtain a homogeneous population  <cit> . next, mini-f containing prv dna was isolated and then transferred into e. coli cells dh10b and subsequently into e.coli strain gs <dig> cells by electroporation for mutagenesis  <cit> . finally, bac dna was isolated and rflps were identified as described  <cit>  using bamh i, kpn i, pst i and sph i, using the complete genome sequence of prv zj <dig> strain  as a reference for in silico prediction.

to generate the ge deletion mutant of prv ah02la strain, another homologous recombination was performed to recover the gi gene and the undeleted sequences of ge as shown in fig.  <dig>  briefly, pcr with primers Δge tv overlap <dig> f and Δge tv overlap <dig> r  was performed with the prv ah02la dna as template. and then cecs were co-transfected with approximately 5 μg prv bac dna and 2 μg dna of fragment from the second pcr reaction of overlap pcr with primersΔge tv overlap <dig> f andΔge tv overlap <dig> r by calcium phosphate precipitation. using illumination at 488 nm, non-fluorescent virus isolates were selected and purified to homogeneity. product structure was confirmed by sequencing with the same primers and other specific primers from the seq-gi/ge series .

for generation of the gi/ge repair virus via homologous recombination, cecs were transfected with approximately 5 μg prv bac dna and 2 μg pcr product generated using dna of parental prv as template and primers matching prv homo 1 f and prv homo 2r  <cit>  . two to three days after transfection, non-fluorescent plaques  were isolated and purified to obtain a homogeneous population. the structure of the recovered viruses was confirmed by pcr and sequencing with primers prv homo 1 f, prv homo 2r and sequencing primers of seq-gi/ge .

preparation of vaccine
prv la-ab and bartha k <dig> viruses were propagated in bhk- <dig> cells using a  <dig> liter bioreactor, each virus stock was diluted to  <dig>  tcid50/ml. after inactivation with formalin  as described  <cit> , vaccines were prepared using mineral oil adjuvant . all vaccines were confirmed to be free of bacteria and fungi, and had the expected physical properties according to standard protocols. vaccines were stored at 4 °c until use.

test of vaccine efficacy
thirty piglets of 21-day-old  were randomly divided into  <dig> groups  and housed in separated facilities. all piglets were antibody negative for prv gb and ge, and free of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus  <dig> and classical swine fever virus. all inoculations were given intramuscularly at 2 ml/pig. group a piglets were inoculated with la-ab, group b piglets with la-ab plus adjuvant cvc <dig> , group c piglets with inactivated bartha k <dig>  group d piglets with live bartha k <dig> of 1 ×  <dig>  tcid <dig> virus/dose, and groups e and f piglets were dosed with pbs only. piglets in groups a, b, and c were inoculated at 28 days of age and again at 56 days. group d piglets were inoculated once, at 28-day-old. group e and f piglets were dosed once, at 28 days of age. three weeks after the second inoculation , groups a, b, c, d and e were challenged i.n. with 3 × ld <dig> prv ah02la per piglet. group f piglets were not challenged, serving as a negative control. serum samples from all piglets were collected before inoculation, and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 49 days post inoculation, and again at 14 days post challenge. serum was subjected to elisa tests for prv gb and ge antibodies, and cross-neutralizing  antibodies against ah02la or bartha k <dig>  body temperature, clinical signs, and virus shedding were monitored and recorded daily until 14 days p.c.. the presence of lung lesions for died or survived piglets was noted at the end of the test.

test for serological antibodies
elisa tests were performed with the prv ge or gb antibody detection kit  following manufacturer’s instructions. cross neutralization tests were conducted according to the standard methods published by oie ) with slight modification. briefly, serum samples were diluted two-fold with pbs, mixed with  <dig> tcid <dig> prv ah02la or prv bartha k <dig> virus, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °c. the serum-virus mixture was used to inoculate bhk- <dig> cells which were then incubated at 37 °c, 5% co <dig> for 3–4 days to observe the development of cpe. titers of neutralizing antibody were expressed as nlog <dig> of highest dilution at which no cpe was observed, and mean titers of each group were calculated for comparison.

detection of virus shedding
nasal swab samples were collected from all piglets before challenge and daily to 14 days after challenge. after shaking at 5000– <dig> rpm for 1–2 min, one freeze-thaw cycle  was conducted to release viruses from nasal swabs. samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for 15 min to pellet tissue and cell debris, the supernatants were collected to determine virus titers. viruses titers were expressed as tcid <dig> following the method of karber.

all animal studies were conducted following guidelines provided by the institutional biosafety committee and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the jiangsu academy of agriculture sciences. experiments involving virulent prv were conducted under biosafety level 2+ containment.

RESULTS
isolation and identification of an emergent pseudorabies virus variant 
bhk- <dig> cells, inoculated with a sample of brain tissue from a stillborn piglet, exhibited cytopathogenic effects  after 3 days. after three rounds of plaque purification, a homogeneous population of virus was isolated and designated as the ah02la strain. using the viral dna as template and the primers prv gi f/ r , pcr generated a product of 1250–1400 bp. sequencing established that this fragment was homologous to the prv gi gene. the ah02la strain can be specifically neutralized with the standard antibodies against prv  with a neutralizing index of  <dig> . these results demonstrate that a variant prv field isolate was identified.

pathology of the prv ah02la strain
the ld <dig> of prv ah02la  was determined using 77-day-old piglets free of antibodies against prv. three of five piglets in the 10- <dig> dosage group, and all of the piglets in the 10- <dig> dosage group, showed typical symptoms of prv infection: sneezing, purulent nasal discharge, difficulty in breathing and ataxia, indicating the high virulence of this strain. the ld <dig> was 10- <dig> /ml. the highly virulent character of ah02la is shared by other emergent prv strains isolated during the  <dig> outbreaks . the significant difference between these emerging strains and the conventional strain s  is that the former cause mortalities in not only young piglets but also much older pigs, whereas the conventional strain s causes death only in young  piglets ).

construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the ah02la genome
green plaques of mini-f recombinant prv ah02la were observed under uv light , and isolated after several rounds of plaque purification. the mini-f recombinant prv ah02la dna was isolated and transfected into escherichia coli dh10b competent cells, the resulting clone was designated bacprv-ah02la. bacprv-ah02la dna was electroporated into e. coli gs <dig> competent cells, resulting in a clone designated bacprv-g. this bac was used for further gene manipulations using the en passant protocol  <cit> . restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of bacprv-g with bamh i, kpn i, pst i and sph i generated patterns similar to those predicted from the prv zj <dig> strain sequence  with minor differences . virus was rescued successfully by transfection of the bacprv-g dna into primary cecs, designated prv ah02lar. in summary, an infectious clone containing the complete genome of the prv emerging variant ah02la strain was constructed successfully.fig.  <dig> plaques of mini-f recombinant prv ah02la strain and rflp of bacprv-g. a images of mini-f recombinant prv ah02la and the parental ah02la plaques under uv excitation  and phase contrast  are shown. arrowhead shows a plaque of parental prv ah02la virus and arrow shows a plaque formed by mini-f recombinant prv ah02la. each panel represents a view of 200 × 200 μm in size. b rflp of bacprv-g, dna from prv ah02la bac clone bacprv-g was prepared by mini-prep and digested with bamh i, kpn i, pst i and sph i . the digests were separated by  <dig> % agarose gel electrophoresis for 16 h under 40 v . predicted rflp patterns of bacprv-g with bamh i, kpn i, pst i and sph i digestion respectively. predictions of these digestions were performed with the whole genome sequence of prv zj <dig> strain  as reference. m: dl  <dig>  dna marker 




construction of a ge deletion mutant virus
after co-transfection of bacprv-g dna with a dna fragment containing the ge deletion , several white plaques were observed under uv illumination at 488 nm. one was isolated after several rounds of plaque purification and designated prv la-ab. the deletion was verified by pcr using primers of Δge tv overlap <dig> f andΔge tv overlap <dig> r, followed by sequencing with the appropriate primers .

growth kinetics of the prv la-ab virus
multistep growth kinetics for the prv la-ab, ah02la, and ah02lar viruses were determined. peak supernatant titers for la-ab, ah02la, and ah02lar were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  tcid <dig> /ml respectively. at  <dig> hpi the titers for la-ab and ah02lar were not significantly different from ah02la . for cell-associated virus titers la-ab, ah02la, and ah02lar were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  tcid <dig> /ml at  <dig> hpi, respectively. the titers of la-ab and ah02lar are not significant different from the parental virus ah02la at  <dig> hpi .

immunogenicity of the la-ab vaccine
in challenge control group, all piglets had typical clinical syndromes of pseudorabies infection including sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and nasal discharge p.c.. two piglets died at 7 days and two at 8 days p.c. . body temperatures of these piglets reached over 41 °c and lasted for 4–5 days ). all the piglets shed virus with titers of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  tcid <dig> / <dig>  ml lasting for 5–7 days till death or 10 days for the surviving piglet ). all piglets showed severe lung lesions from hemorrhaging and congestion .table  <dig> antibodies, clinical signs and lung lesions in animals


b.v means before vaccination, p.v means post vaccination, p.c means post challenge. “a” indicates the number of piglets positive;“b” indicates the number of piglets in the group. “c” indicates mean titers of neutralizing antibody of each group expressed as nlog <dig> of highest dilution at which no cpe was observed


fig.  <dig> body temperatures and virus shedding post challenge with prv ah02la strain. a body temperatures of piglets in vaccinated groups were detected together with challenge control and placebo control from one day before challenge to 14 days post challenge. average temperatures of five piglets of each group were taken for comparison. error bars represent the standard deviations. b nasal swab samples of all piglets of vaccinated groups together with challenge control and placebo control groups were collected before challenge and daily up to 14 days after challenge for virus isolation and titer determination. the titers of viruses were expressed as tcid <dig> on bhk- <dig> cells following the method of karber. average titers were determined with the samples that virus exceeding were detected




gb antibodies were detected in all piglets vaccinated with live bartha k <dig> strain or the la-ab strain plus adjuvant at 7 days post vaccination, while two of five piglets vaccinated la-ab strain alone or the inactivated bartha k <dig> strain were anti-gb positive at 7 days p.v.. all samples collected at 14 days p.v. were positive for gb antibodies . this result indicates the adjuvant cvc <dig> helps the la-ab vaccine stimulate immunity against prv more quickly. at 14 days p.c. all piglets were positive for ge antibodies .

no neutralizing antibodies  against the ah02la or bartha k <dig> strain, were detected in any of the piglets at 7 days p.v.. at 14 days p.v. neutralizing antibodies were detected in one piglet from group b  at a titer of  <dig>  in groups a, b, and c, na titers began increasing quickly seven days after the boost and continued to increase over the next two weeks. the la-ab vaccines induced higher titers of na against the ah02la and bartha k <dig> strain, than vaccines made of bartha k <dig>  one dose of live bartha k <dig> vaccine stimulated a weak na titer of less than  <dig> against the ah02la strain or the bartha k <dig> strain. these results indicate that optimizing the prime-boost regimen is necessary for live bartha k <dig> vaccine to stimulate strong humoral immunity. na titers in group b piglets were higher than other groups, indicating that adjuvant cvc <dig> helped stimulate higher specific immunity for la-ab vaccine .

all piglets in the vaccinated groups  were protected against lethal challenge. fevers in group a and b piglets were transient, and other clinical symptoms were mild or absent respectively. titers of shed virus in la-ab vaccinated group a piglets were  <dig>  ~  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig>  ml lasting 3–4 days; in la-ab plus adjuvant group b piglets, titers were  <dig>  ~  <dig>  tcid50/ <dig>  ml lasting 3–4 days. piglets in groups c and d  presented fevers of more than 41 °c lasting for 4–6 days ), four and three piglets respectively, presented sneezing lasting for 2–4 days and nasal discharge lasting 2–3 days . the titers of shed virus in these piglets were  <dig>  ~  <dig>  tcid <dig> / <dig>  ml lasting for 5–6 days ). no lung lesions were observed in any group a or b piglets, while 2/ <dig> group c piglets and in 1/ <dig> group d piglets presented lesions from hemorrhage and congestion .

discussion
the results of vaccination test demonstrate that vaccines made of prv la-ab elicit a more effective immune response against the emergent prv ah02la than the bartha k <dig> vaccines. the immune response is even more pronounced when prv la-ab is administered with adjuvant. pigs vaccinated with la-ab produced lower titers of virus shedding over a shorter duration than pigs with bartha k <dig>  this is a clear advantage in the terms of controlling the spread of infection. adjuvant cvc <dig> is a mixture of monophosphoryl lipid a , muramyl dipeptide  and β-glucan. this mixture has been shown to improve the efficiency of the inactivated vaccines of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and foot and mouth disease virus . mpla, mdp and β-glucan can serve as delivery systems or stimulators for the immune system .

bacterial artificial chromosome of herpesvirus is a useful tool for generation of gene modified mutants to study the mechanism of the viruses. after the construction of the first bac of mouse cytomegalovirus   <cit> , a few of herpesvirus genomes have been maintained in bacs as infectious clones, which have provided great help for discovery of pathology of these viruses  <cit>  and construction of vectored vaccines  <cit> , especially following the protocol of en passant protocol  <cit> . the parental prv ah02la strain of the bac constructed in this study is a virulent variant strain that caused severe losses in many porcine farms in china. so even though en passant protocol was not performed in the generation of the ge deleted la-ab strain in this study, it will be used for further analysis of the mechanism of the high virulence of this variant.

the latent infection of prv is always a potential threat to porcine herds  <cit> . so the eradication of prv has been a direct aim of many farms for control of this disease. this aim has been achieved in a few countries  <cit>  and the infection of wild prv has been controlled to very low levels in some individual farms in china before  <dig>  <cit> . diva vaccine has played an important role towards this aim  <cit> . in the project of eradication of prv, the efficient reduction of virus shedding post infection with virulent strain is crucial  <cit> . in this study, the inactivated vaccine of la-ab strain with adjuvant cvc <dig> reduced virus shedding significantly, despite that all vaccinated animals did not stop virus shedding post challenge.

we did find a difference in the profile of clinical symptoms between animals challenged through i.m. or i.n. route. during the challenge test in this study, we also tried the challenge route of i.m. injection for 11-week-old piglets . we found that even though it caused high fever and obvious clinical syndromes of pr through this way, the virulence was significantly lower than through i.n. way. this difference is presumed to be associated with the increased titers of virus after replication on epithelial cells of respiratory tract. to mimick the nature infection of domestic pigs genuinely, we did the challenge protection test through i.n. way for evaluation of the vaccines in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
the infectious clone consists of the whole genome of prv emerging variant ah02la strain. inactivated vaccine made of prv la-ab strain can provide better clinical protection than vaccines made of bartha k <dig>  in addition, significant decrease of virus shedding was observed post lethal challenge when la-ab inactivated vaccine were adjuvanted with cvc <dig>
