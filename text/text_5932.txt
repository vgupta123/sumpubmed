BACKGROUND
taxonomic classification of members of the order rickettsiales was originally based on relatively few phenotypic criteria  <cit> . over the past twenty years, the taxonomic classification of the order rickettsiales has undergone many changes. on the basis of 16s rdna sequences, coxiella burnetii was reclassified within the legionellaceae  <cit> , eperythrozoon sp. within the mycoplasmataceae  <cit> , and rochalimaea sp., grahamella sp., and bartonella sp. within the bartonellaceae, closely related to brucella sp  <cit> . among the remaining members of the order rickettsiales, the anaplasma-ehrlichia clade was recently reorganized into  <dig> genera  <cit> ; and r. tsutsugamushi was reclassified into a new genus, orientia  <cit> . within the genus rickettsia, since the pioneering work of philip in  <dig>  <cit> , two rickettsial strains were considered as having different serotypes if they exhibited a specificity difference of â‰¥  <dig> and some authors have considered this to be a useful guide to speciation  <cit> . however, opinions divide as to whether this holds true for rickettsial strains related to rickettsia conorii   <cit> . these include indian tick typhus rickettsia   <cit> , israeli spotted fever rickettsia   <cit>  and astrakhan fever rickettsia   <cit> . phylogenetically, these rickettsiae constitute a homogeneous cluster supported by significant bootstrap values and are distinct from other rickettsia species   <cit> . some authors have considered these rickettsial strains as different species and proposed the names r. sharonii and r. caspii for isfr and afr, respectively  <cit> . other authors believe that they belong to a "r. conorii complex"  <cit> .

these rickettsiae closely related to r. conorii have been described as the causative agents of mediterranean spotted fever, astrakhan fever, israeli spotted fever, and indian tick typhus in the mediterranean basin and africa, southern russia, middle east, and india, respectively. these rickettsioses are transmitted to humans by rhipicephalus ticks  <cit> . furthermore, most of their clinical features overlap and are characterized by a febrile illness and a generalized maculopapular rash. however, an inoculation eschar is seldom present in astrakhan fever and israeli spotted fever but common in mediterranean spotted fever .

recently, we have proposed gene sequence-based criteria for the identification of rickettsia isolates at the genus, group and species levels and proposed criteria to define species  <cit> . using these criteria, we have shown that ittr, isfr and afr could not be considered as distinct species. instead, they belonged to the r. conorii species  <cit> . however, these rickettsiae exhibit differentiable serotypes and cause diseases with distinct clinical features in defined geographic locations. the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics  <cit>  has proposed that even if related genetically, bacterial isolates within a given species could be considered as distinct subspecies if they differed phenotypically.

in this study, we undertook to examine whether phenotypic differences existed among various r. conorii isolates that would enable to classify them as subspecies. we estimated the degree of genotypic variabilities among  <dig> isolates of r. conorii,  <dig> isolate of ittr,  <dig> isolates and  <dig> tick amplicons of afr, and  <dig> isolates of isfr using multi-locus sequence typing . we incorporated 16s rdna and glta genes, as well as  <dig> membrane-exposed protein-encoding genes ompa, ompb and sca <dig>   <cit>  in mlst. to further characterize the specificities of distinct mlst types, we incorporated a prototype isolate from each of these into a multi-spacer typing  assay, which we have previously demonstrated to be more discriminant than mlst at the strain level for r. conorii  <cit> . furthermore, mouse serotypes were obtained for each of these mlst types.

RESULTS
mlst-gene sequencing
all five genes studied were amplified from all  <dig> studied isolates and from  <dig> of  <dig> rhipicephalus pumilio ticks tested. all negative controls remained negative. four mlst types were identified. within the first type, which we named malish type, all r. conorii isolates exhibited identical sequences for each of the five genes tested except isolates moroccan and m <dig>  these latter isolates showed deletions of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, at the 5'-end of the ompa gene. the second type, the ittr type, was made of ittr. this exhibited unique nucleotide substitutions in ompa, ompb and sca <dig> genes. within the afr type, all isolates and tick amplicons tested showed identical sequences of the five genes studied except the chad isolate which showed subtle nucleotide substitutions in each of them. in this isolate, the pairwise nucleotide similarity with afr for 16s rdna, glta, ompa, ompb and sca <dig> genes was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  %, respectively. the fourth type, isfr type, which included both isfr isolates, showed the same nucleotide substitutions in each of the five genes tested. this differentiated them from other rickettsiae. as representative strains for each mlst genotype, we have chosen r. conorii isolate malish, ittr isolate indian, afr isolate a- <dig>  and isfr isolate istt cdc <dig> 

among representatives of the four mlst genotypes, the degree of pairwise nucleotide similarity ranged from  <dig>  % between afr and isfr to  <dig> % between r. conorii and ittr for the 16s rdna gene . for glta, such similarity ranged from  <dig>  % between malish  and isfr to  <dig> % between r. conorii and ittr. for the 5' end of ompa, the degree of pairwise sequence similarity ranged from  <dig>  between afr and ittr to  <dig> % between r. conorii and ittr. this pairwise similarity ranged from  <dig>  between ittr and isfr to  <dig> % between r. conorii and ittr for ompb. for sca <dig>  the pairwise sequence similarity varied from  <dig>  between ittr and isfr to  <dig> % between r. conorii and ittr.

the dendrograms obtained using the three different tree building analysis methods showed similar organization for the five rickettsiae studied. we identified two monophyletic groups with the trees so constructed. one included r. conorii and ittr and the other, isfr and afr . the clustering of these rickettsiae was supported by high bootstrap values. both afr isolates were grouped together for each of the five genes tested.

mst genotyping
ittr showed unique 232-bp dksa / xerc  and 153-bp mppa / purc  spacer sequences. however, it also showed a 200-bp rpme / trna-fmet spacer sequence identical to that of r. conorii type b ; isfr had unique 232-bp dksa / xerc , 153-bp mppa / purc , and 200-bp rpme / trna-fmet  spacer sequences; afr isolates a- <dig> and chad showed unique dksa / xerc of 232-  and 167-bp , respectively. they also showed identical 153-bp mppa / purc  and 200-bp rpme / trna-fmet  spacer sequences that were different from those of other strains. when combining the genotypes obtained from each of the three spacers into a mst genotype, each of the four rickettsiae showed a distinct mst genotype. the mst genotype so obtained was different from that of r. conorii. however, on pairwise comparisons of the four strains, both afr strains showed similar spacer types. the phylogenetic tree inferred from the concatenated spacer sequences showed an organization similar to that obtained from mlst when malish strain was taken as r. conorii type strain . however, the node where isfr branched was not supported by a significant bootstrap value.

microimmunofluorescence  serotyping
when injected into mice, all five rickettsiae tested provoked antibody responses that were detectable by mif. the endpoint titers and specificity differences  were calculated as described in the methods section. these values are presented in table  <dig>  the antibody titres obtained in homologous sera were at least one-fold higher than those observed in heterologous sera. the spds for heterologous sera varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  four serotypes were identified. these included r. conorii, ittr, both afr isolates, and isfr. the dendrogram inferred from the matrix based on spds  showed that ittr occupied a position that slightly differed from its phylogenetic organization. instead of forming a cluster with r. conorii, it occupied an intermediate position between r. conorii and isfr .

discussion
we propose to create subspecies within the r. conorii species to accommodate both the genotypic homogeneity and the serotypic, mst genotypic, geographic and pathogenic diversities of rickettsia strains within this species.

defining a species within the rickettsia genus has long been difficult but rickettsiologists have agreed to use mouse serotyping as one criterion  <cit> . this classification scheme served as a basis for the development of genotypic criteria at the species level  <cit> . however, confusion still exists about the taxonomic status of rickettsiae. this is especially the case for rickettsiae which are closely related to classic r. conorii isolates. philip et al.  <cit> , using mouse serotyping, have demonstrated that r. conorii isolates malish, moroccan and kenya were closely related antigenically to ittr and that they belonged to a single serotype. using complement fixation, bozeman et al.  <cit>  were unable to distinguish ittr from r. conorii isolates. in contrast, others, using mouse polyclonal antibodies  <cit> , and monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , have demonstrated substantial differences between ittr and r. conorii isolates. isfr and afr could not be distinguished using pcr-rflp  <cit>  until ompa was used as target gene  <cit> . in  <dig>  we have demonstrated that afr differed from both isfr and r. conorii in terms of sds-page mobility and pfge profiles  <cit> . although they are difficult to distinguish serologically, the cross-reacting epitopes they share are located on antigenic proteins that differ in sds-page mobility and hence in molecular weight  <cit> . in  <dig>  walker et al., using serotyping, western bloting, monoclonal antibody reactivity and pcr amplification of the tandem repeats within ompa, concluded that isfr belonged to the r. conorii species  <cit> . in  <dig>  dasch and jackson differentiated r. conorii from isfr using pcr-rflp  <cit> . recently, using a combination of genotypic criteria, we have demonstrated that the genotypic differences among ittr, afr and isfr were too subtle to classify them as new species  <cit> . instead, they belonged to the r. conorii species.

in the present study, we have demonstrated, using mlst, that rickettsiae closely related to r. conorii isolate malish are very homogeneous. except isolates moroccan and m <dig> which showed one ompa deletion of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, all studied r. conorii isolates had identical sequences for the five genes studied and thus constituted a reliable taxon. the ittr isolate showed unique sequences of ompa, ompb and sca <dig> genes. among isolates and tick amplicons of afr, the degree of mlst sequence similarity was of 100% except for the chad isolate which is genotypically slightly different from afr isolate a- <dig>  <cit> . in another study, we have found identical ompa sequences in four tick amplicons from kosovo and afr isolate a- <dig>  <cit> . we have also observed serologic, antigenic and genetic homogeneities among two tick and one human afr isolates from astrakhan  <cit> . thus, except the chad isolate which was slightly different genotypically, afr, with three strains and ten tick amplicons studied, appeared to form a homogeneous taxon. the two isolates of isfr tested showed 100% pairwise nucleotide similarity in all five genes studied. as we have compared only two isolates, one may argue that this may not be representative of the diversity of ompa in isfr. however, walker et al. found four human isfr isolates from israel to be highly homogeneous antigenically as well as genetically  <cit> . bacellar et al. described three human isolates of isfr from portugal that showed 100% similarity in 16s rdna, glta and ompa sequence with those of isfr isolate isttcdc <dig>  <cit> . giammanco et al. identified a tick rickettsial isolate in italy that had 100% ompa sequence similarity with isfr isolate isttcdc <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it appeared that our isfr isolates were representatives of the same homogeneous taxon.

in the first part of the study, we have identified four mlst genotypes which were subjected to further evaluation. among representatives of these mlst genotypes, the minimal pairwise similarity in the nucleotide sequences of 16s rdna, glta, ompa, ompb, and sca <dig> genes between the rickettsial isolates tested and r. conorii, was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. thus, all four isolates tested fulfilled the criteria to belong to the r. conorii species  <cit> .

phylogenetically, the members of the r. conorii complex have been demonstrated to form a stable group distinct from other rickettsia species   <cit> . we found that within this cluster they consistently formed two phylogenetic clusters . one of these clusters included r. conorii and ittr, and the other, afr isolates and isfr. using mst, we identified five genotypes. however, using pairwise comparison of spacer sequences, we identified only four genotypes similar to those obtained by mlst. mst-based phylogeny also demonstrated a similar pattern . serotypically, we could identify four serotypes which, according to the definition of species proposed by philip  <cit> , would classify them as different species: 1) r. conorii isolate malish; 2) ittr; 3) afr; and 4) isfr. these four serotypes also showed distinct mst genotypes.

we demonstrated a discrepancy between the genotypic homogeneity of these rickettsiae, which classified them within the r. conorii species  <cit> , and their mst genotypic, serotypic, geographic, and pathogenic heterogeneity. for ittr, an additional discrepancy was observed between its phylogenetic and serotypic classifications . such findings are in accordance with those of walker et al. who had shown substantial differences between ittr and r. conorii isolates  <cit> . we also agree with these authors who hypothesized that all members of the "so-called" r. conorii complex belonged to the r. conorii species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that r. conorii and closely related strains exhibit a high level of conservation in nucleotide sequence despite genotypic specificities, and phenotypic specificities including serotyping, epidemiological and clinical characteristics. therefore, according to the accepted criteria of the ad hoc committee on reconciliation of approaches to bacterial systematics which allow the creation of subspecies for genetically-close isolates which express phenotypic differences  <cit> , we are justified in creating new subspecies for these organisms.
