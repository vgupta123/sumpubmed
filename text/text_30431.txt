BACKGROUND
one of the critical events in blood coagulation is the conversion of large amounts of the zymogen prothrombin to the enzyme thrombin by the enzymatic complex prothrombinase. the prothrombinase complex is formed by the non-covalent interaction between the enzyme factor xa  and the non-enzymatic cofactor factor va  on a phospholipid surface in the presence of calcium  <cit> . the procofactor, factor v, is activated by thrombin to generate a calcium-associated two chain molecule, composed of a heavy chain  and light chain    <cit> . the prothrombinase complex increases thrombin generation over fxa alone by  <dig> orders of magnitude  <cit> . the explosive burst in prothrombin conversion is essential to rapidly form a stable fibrin clot in response to a vascular injury. the fibrin clot is formed when thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to form an insoluble polymer network  <cit> . this fibrin network becomes cross-linked and stabilized by factor xiiia which also traps platelets and red blood cells sealing the wound  <cit> .

it is critical that once a procoagulant response to vascular injury has been initiated that an appropriate anticoagulant response is concurrently mounted. as such, the components of the prothrombinase complex are targets of multiple regulatory mechanisms to terminate the production of thrombin. first, fxa availability is regulated by formation of inhibition complexes with antithrombin , α1-antitrypsin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor   <cit> . the cofactor, fva, is a target for degradation by activated protein c . apc, a serine protease derived from its plasma precursor protein c  in a thrombin dependent process  <cit> , plays a critical role in inactivating the non-enzymatic cofactor components of both the prothrombinase and the intrinsic tenase complexes, factors va and viiia, respectively  <cit> . additional key components of the pc pathway include: thrombomodulin and endothelial protein c receptor  which contribute to apc formation  <cit> ; protein s which functions as a cofactor enhancing apc efficacy  <cit> ; and protein c inhibitor, a suppressor of apc formation  <cit> .

an increased risk of thrombotic disease has been associated with partial deficiencies or loss of function mutations in the pc pathway, including deficiencies in pc, its cofactor protein s, or proteins involved in the activation of pc  <cit> . the most prevalent defect in the pc pathway is a result of a genetic mutation in fv that renders the cofactor resistant to apc inactivation  <cit> . this resistance to apc was first characterized by dahlbäck and coworkers  <cit>  and derives from a mutation at one of the apc inactivation sites  on fv/fva rendering it resistant to apc cleavage  <cit> .

apc catalyzed inactivation of fva cofactor activity is a complex, membrane dependent process involving cleavage at multiple sites in the fvahc, the generation of transient species with partial cofactor activity, and the ultimate disassociation of a fragment of the fvahc from the molecule rendering it catalytically inactive. apc interacts with fva or partially proteolyzed fva species through their light chains to form enzymesubstrate complexes  <cit> . additional studies have identified other regions of interaction, including the proteolytic target residues and the surrounding regions, in the fva heavy chain involved in the enzymesubstrate complex formation  <cit> . three arginine residues are targeted in human apcfva complexes: arg <dig>  arg <dig>  and arg <dig> <cit> . a number of studies have defined the activities of the partially proteolyzed fva species  <cit> . cleavage at either arg <dig> or arg <dig> results in cofactor species, fvai <dig> and fvai <dig>  respectively, with reduced but similar cofactor activity in the prothrombinase complex   <cit> . cleavage at arg <dig> has been shown to be essential for full loss of cofactor activity  <cit> . the significance of the cleavage at arg <dig> remains undetermined. the final inactive cofactor, fvai, is a two chain molecule composed of the fvalc and fva1- <dig> fragment   <cit> . the inactive cofactor binds apc with the same affinity as the intact cofactor  <cit> , suggesting a potential role of product inhibition in regulating apc efficacy  <cit> .

the complexity of this process led hockin and coworkers to construct an ordinary differential equation based description of the network of reactions characterizing the process of bovine apc inactivation of bovine fva using rate constants gleaned from studies with bovine, human and recombinant human proteins  <cit> . empirical studies from a number of laboratories detailing apc inactivation of fva have shown the cleavage at arg <dig> preceding that at arg <dig>  with these data initially  being interpreted as indicating a sequential or ordered kinetic mechanism  <cit> . however, based on their mathematical modeling, hockin et al.  <cit> , concluded that the reaction pathway was better described as a random order cleavage process for arg <dig> and arg <dig>  in which each of the cleavages is independent of the other, but occurs at different rates , and where full loss of cofactor activity requires disassociation of the fragment of the fvahc downstream from the arg <dig> cleavage  <cit> .

numerous studies examining how components like fxa, prothrombin and protein s modulate apc inactivation of fva have been reported  <cit> . these studies routinely employ approaches like progress curve analysis based on curve fitting to compare initial rates, or natural and recombinant cleavage site mutants to detail mechanistic features. to date, however, an integrated approach, one combining the use of physicochemical model construction based on prior research and model verification via construction of corresponding reaction systems using purified proteins, has not been extended to understand apc regulation of the prothrombinase complex stability and function. in this study we build on the prior studies modeling apc inactivation of fva  <cit>  by incorporating the presence of additional components of the prothrombinase complex  to construct an empirically validated mathematical model. to test model constructs, a step-wise approach to increasing the number of components was used. experiments were replicated multiple times with different preparations of proteins in order to generate robust data sets that included estimates of measurement error. at each level of complexity, we empirically monitored multiple analytes, including starting reactants, intermediates and final products to provide multiple points of comparison to evaluate each model’s performance.

RESULTS
apc inactivation of factor va
empirical analyses
the inactivation of fva  was monitored at two apc concentrations  in the presence of excess pc:ps vesicles . the lower concentration of apc was used to initiate a slow inactivation reaction that would enable multiple time points to monitor the sequence of proteolytic events and the residual cofactor activity . in studies with  <dig>  nm apc, within one minute there was a 50 % loss in cofactor activity  which continued in a monophasic decay. according to previous studies, measurement of fva cofactor activity as measured in clotting assays is sensitive to apc cleavage of arg <dig> <cit> .

western blot analyses  monitoring the disappearance of intact fvahc  display the rapid proteolysis of fva heavy chain proteolyzed at either site within the first or third minutes with  <dig>  or  <dig>  nm apc, respectively . these results were each fit to monophasic exponential decays , and the initial slope of the fitted curve was determined after normalizing the densitometry to the maximal value . at  <dig>  nm apc, the initial rate of disappearance of the heavy chain was  <dig> pm/s ; at  <dig>  nm apc, the rate of disappearance was nearly three-fold faster . the disappearance of the heavy chain is initially concurrent with accumulation of the fva1- <dig> fragment . the generation of the fva1- <dig> fragment reaches a maximum within 30 sec  or 90 sec  . at this point most of the fvahc has been proteolyzed primarily at arg <dig>  and the secondary cleavage at arg <dig> in the fva1- <dig> species becomes the dominant proteolytic event. analysis of the appearance of the inactivation fragment fva307- <dig> , indicates that as the fva1- <dig> fragment is approaching its maximum level it is being further proteolyzed to the fva307- <dig> fragment. in order to isolate the kinetics of proteolysis at arg <dig>  fvai <dig> was used as the starting material in inactivation studies with  <dig>  nm apc . this membrane bound partially proteolyzed species has already lost most of its cofactor activity in a clotting assay  <cit> . tracking of the final inactivation fragment, fva307- <dig>  by western blotting reveals a monophasic accumulation of this fragment  .

mathematical simulations
using the non-sequential reaction mechanism proposed by hockin et al.   <cit>  and kinetic constants used to describe their bovine system of proteins, in silico simulations of apc inactivation of fva were performed and predicted time courses for various fva inactivation species compared to the empirical data presented in figure  <dig>  mathematical simulations show good correlation with empirical measurements of fva cofactor activity and the densitometric analysis of fvahc . hockin et al. reported a good fit using this model between simulated and empirical time courses of apc catalyzed changes in cofactor activity in the bovine system  <cit> . the present study’s correlation between clotting assay measurements, in silico fva cofactor activity, and densitometric analysis of fvahc are consistent with the findings of earlier studies that fva cofactor activity is based on the amount of intact fvahc present  <cit> .

c rate constant used for mathematical simulations, as determined by inactivation studies with human fva and human apc in this study, is  <dig>  s- <dig>  this new rate constant will be used in all subsequent mathematical simulations.

however, the predicted generation and disappearance of the fva1- <dig> fragment are significantly delayed compared to the empirical data for this inactivation fragment . at  <dig>  nm apc, the simulation predicts that this fragment will reach a maximum at  <dig>  min before slowly disappearing, with 30 % still remaining after 20 min; the empirical experiments show the peak level reached at  <dig>  min with only 9 % remaining after 20 min . the mathematical simulation fared better with  <dig>  nm apc  with respect to the timing of peak accumulation, however failed to recapitulate the rapid clearance of this fragment. mathematical simulations of fva307- <dig> using the hockin et al.  <cit>  rate constants resulted in an estimated six-fold slower accumulation of this fragment compared to empirical data .

though the bovine based hockin et al.  <cit>  rate constants clearly captured the disappearance of fvahc as measured through activity and fragment analysis, they did not accurately predict the presentation of either the fva1- <dig> or fva307- <dig> fragments in the human system. the rapid clearance of the fva1- <dig> fragment and faster appearance of the smaller fva307- <dig> fragment led us to speculate that their model rate constant for the cleavage at arg <dig> was not appropriate for the human system of proteins. from a comparison of the empirical data to the initial in silico simulation we estimated that the rate of cleavage occurring at arg <dig> was three times faster than the model predictions. to account for this the rate constant  in the mathematical model was adjusted from  <dig>  s- <dig> to  <dig>  s- <dig> and simulations rerun for all analytes . as expected the simulated predictions for fva cofactor activity and fvahc were minimally altered by this change and continued to correlate well with their respective empirical measures . the adjusted rate constant significantly altered the in silico predictions for both smaller fva inactivation fragments  yielding a better fit with empirical results. the revised model using the adjusted kinetic rate was extended to experiments conducted with fvai <dig> and the predicted time courses for the two models compared to the empirical results . as can be seen in all simulations, those using the published bovine model values  resulted in a poorer fit  <cit> . the rate constant for cleavage at arg <dig>  k <dig>  was adjusted to  <dig>  s- <dig> for all subsequent studies.

our empirically driven adjustment to k <dig> results in a second order rate constant for the overall process of cleavage at arg <dig> of  <dig>  x 107 m-1 s- <dig>  previously published second order rate constants for the apc cleavage at arg <dig> in human fva  are an order of magnitude lower than our currently derived estimate and lower than that used by hockin et al.  to describe the bovine system.

studies using human proteins on apc inactivation of fva reported second order rate constants for the cleavage at arg <dig> ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  x 107 m-1 s- <dig> <cit> ; a more recent study by nicolaes et al.  <cit>  has reported the second order rate constant to be  <dig>  x 108 m- <dig> s- <dig>  this value is quite similar to the value  used in the current study.

an alternative approach to fitting these data sets would have been to use an optimization method in which all rate constants may be simultaneously adjusted to generate a best fit to all the experimental data. failure of model predictions to fit the empirical data can stem from the collective effect of small errors in the rate constants used. it is not uncommon for laboratories to report 2– <dig> fold differences in rate constants of biochemical reactions and interactions measured in vitro. these ranges are accepted because the findings would fall within the margin of error expected for slightly variable experiments conducted in different laboratories, or for different techniques used to measure a rate constant. such variation can have significant effects on model outputs  <cit> . however, lack of fit can arise from a fundamental mistake or omitted interaction in the reaction description. therefore, we have not taken this approach as we developed this model.

apc inactivation of factor va: effect of factor xa under non-saturating conditions
it has been widely reported that fxa shields fva from degradation by apc through its reversible association in the prothrombinase  complex  <cit> . the mechanistic basis of this protection has been conceptualized as a mutually exclusive competition for association with membrane bound fva, so that when fva is associated with fxa it is not a substrate for apc  <cit> , at least at the arg <dig> site  <cit> . in order to develop a model description that can predict the extent of the protective effect exerted by fxa against apc proteolysis of fva over a range of reactant concentrations, empirical experiments were performed at saturating and non-saturating concentrations of fxa.

empirical analyses
in the first set of experiments, prothrombinase was preformed under non-saturating concentrations with fva in excess  on 20 μm pc:ps vesicles. under these conditions, if the kd =  <dig>  nm for the  complex , only 13 % of the fva would be expected to be bound to fxa. inactivation reactions were initiated with  <dig>   <dig> , or  <dig>  nm apc. for these experiments, the amount of thrombin generated in the  <dig> nm apc control was set at 100 % prothrombinase activity, with thrombin generation levels represented relative to the prothrombinase activity in the  <dig> nm apc control. the loss of prothrombinase activity following the addition of apc at either concentration  appeared to follow a monophasic decay .

mathematical simulations
to simulate this experiment, six additional equations were required . of these, four equations describe the formation of a prothrombinase complex between fxa and fva  or any of the three partially proteolyzed fva species  using a kd twice that describing the complex formed with intact fva  . several empirical studies using plasma derived fva and recombinant fva mutants have demonstrated that fvai <dig> and fvai <dig> can complex with fxa and form a productive enzyme complex  <cit> . two additional equations allow for the dissociation of heavy chain fragments from the prothrombinase species formed with either fvai <dig> or fvai306/ <dig>

our initial mathematical simulations were carried out utilizing a kd of  <dig>  nm  <cit> , resulting in an initial concentration of  <dig> pm for prothrombinase, with off and on rates of  <dig>  s- <dig> and  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig>  respectively   <cit> . the mathematical predictions for the loss of prothrombinase activity in the presence of either  <dig>  or  <dig>  nm apc showed an approximately 2-fold faster loss in prothrombinase activity than observed in the empirical experiments .

to generate a better fit to the empirical data we first examined the dissociation constant of fxa and fva on pc:ps vesicles, which by literature reports varies from as low as  <dig> pm  <cit>  to as high as  <dig> nm  <cit> . simulations to test the wide range of reported kd values were first conducted by altering the koff rate constants for the prothrombinase complex, while maintaining the same kon rate constant of  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig>  for each kd value tested, the starting concentrations of free and bound species  were recalculated and used as the initial conditions for a mathematical simulation. an adjustment made to the off rate for the prothrombinase complex resulting in a kd of  <dig>  nm  generated an in silico prediction that more closely represented the empirical results seen with both  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm apc .

in addition to altering the koff rate constant while maintaining a kon rate constant to reach a desired overall kd, changes to both isolated rate constants were explored as a potential solution. one alternative that we explored was adjusting the kon rate constant to  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig> and setting the koff rate constant to values that yielded the same set of kd values. figure  <dig>  panel b presents these model results at  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm apc  for kd's of  <dig>  nm  and  <dig>  nm  for prothrombinase assembly. in contrast to simulations based with a kon value of  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig> this analysis indicates that a kd of  <dig>  nm yields a better fit to the data.

these results highlight an important feature of dynamic systems like this one: the magnitude of the observed protective effect may depend not only on the concentrations of the three protein components and the kd's characterizing their interactions, but also on the rate constants defining the competing kd's.

apc inactivation of factor va: effect of factor xa under saturating conditions
the previous analysis under non-saturating conditions indicates that either a dissociation constant of  <dig>  nm or  <dig>  nm for the prothrombinase complex can recapitulate our empirical data depending on the values assigned to kon and koff. from the point of view of empirically measuring kon and koff values the differences in these assigned values  are small and within the margin of error for this type of analysis. in order to further explore which dissociation constant and set of rate constants is appropriate for the empirical data, we tested apc inactivation of fva under saturating conditions with fxa present in excess .

empirical analyses
reactions where the fva population is highly associated with fxa* showed 70 % of fvahc remained after  <dig> minute  compared to ~ 10 % without fxa* . comparison of initial rates showed a greater than 7-fold reduction in the initial rate of  <dig>  nm apc proteolysis of fva due to its fxa association . consistent with this overall suppression of heavy chain proteolysis, generation of the fva1- <dig> fragment was slower in the presence of fxa*, reaching a maximum in 2 min vs ~30 s in its absence . its clearance was also suppressed, taking ~ 4 min to decline to 50 % of its maximum as opposed to ~1 min without fxa* .

in contrast to apc inactivation studies conducted in the absence of fxa*, visual inspection of western blot images  reveal the accumulation of the fva307-679/ <dig> fragment leading to more reliable quantitative densitometric analysis of this fragment . generation of this fragment reaches 50 % of its maximal level by  <dig> minute, and remains at elevated levels above 70 % of maximal level after  <dig> minutes . generation of the fva307- <dig> fragment reaches 50 % of maximal value after  <dig> minutes .

mathematical simulations
initial prothrombinase concentrations given the condition of pre-incubating  <dig> nm fva and  <dig> nm fxa* were calculated to be  <dig>  nm or  <dig>  nm using kd values of either  <dig>  nm or  <dig>  nm, respectively. a range of kon and koff rate constants for each kd were tested by varying kon values between  <dig> and  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig>  time courses of the inactivation of fva by  <dig>  nm apc were produced. the results of this in silico study indicated that the disappearance of fvahc was dependent on the resultant kd value and independent of the combination of kon and koff rate constants used to generate the kd values of  <dig>  or  <dig>  nm . assuming the kd for prothrombinase is  <dig>  nm and the kon is either  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig> or  <dig>  x 108 m-1 s- <dig>  the model predicts that after 6 min 25 % of the fvahc is proteolyzed , in contrast to the empirical results showing ~82 % of fvahc proteolyzed at  <dig> minutes . model simulations with kd values of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm or  <dig>  nm resulted in fvahc levels decreasing after 6 min by 75 % , 83 % , or 87 % , respectively. from the mathematical simulations, the initial rates of fvahc proteolysis were  <dig> pm/s,  <dig> pm/s, and  <dig> pm/s for kd’s of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm, and  <dig>  nm, respectively, compared to the empirically derived rate of fvahc proteolysis of  <dig> pm/s. overall these comparisons support our eliminating  <dig>  nm as the kd for the prothrombinase complex.

while the mathematical model is able to recapitulate the overall combined initial cleavages of fvahc , there is a mixed success for the predictions of the inactivation fragments . specifically, the mathematical model captures the rapid accumulation of the fva307-679/ <dig> fragment , but does not capture the clearance of the fva1- <dig> fragment  or the generation of the fva307- <dig> fragment . the same lack of fit for the proteolysis of this fragment is observed when fvai <dig> is the starting substrate .

in the mathematical model as constructed apc proteolysis at any site is permitted only with fva species not bound to fxa . the more rapid clearance of fva1- <dig> observed empirically suggests two possible problems with the model construct: 1) the binding affinity between fvai <dig> and fxa is weaker than the model value of  <dig> nm based on studies with bovine fva  <cit>  or 2) apc can cleave at arg <dig> when the fvai <dig> species is bound to fxa. previous studies with recombinant human proteins have reported kd values ranging from ~ <dig>  nm  <cit>  to ~ <dig>  nm  <cit> . to evaluate the likelihood that a weaker binding affinity was the culprit, mathematical simulations were conducted where the kd for the fxafvai <dig> complex was varied; to fit the empirical data the kd for this complex would have to be greater than  <dig> nm  and as such this adjustment was discarded as a viable option.

the alternative explanation for the empirical data presenting the clearance of the fva1- <dig> fragment is that when bound to fxa, the fvai <dig> species is susceptible to apc cleavage at arg <dig>  to explore this hypothesis, an additional reaction was added to the mathematical construct: apc cleaving  at arg <dig>  to establish whether there was a value for this rate constant that would improve the fit, simulations varying its value were run using the model value  for the cleavage of arg <dig> in free fva as a point of reference. representative examples are presented in figure  <dig>  the mathematical analysis suggests that if the arg <dig> in  is a target for apc, the magnitude of the rate constant regulating the event is ~ <dig> to 20 % that for free fva.

structural analysis
analysis of the proposed structural models of the prothrombinase complex allows for the possibility that arg <dig> is susceptible to apc in the fxafvai <dig> complex  <cit> . the prothrombinase complex models differ in the orientation of fxa relative to fva, and the binding interface between enzyme and cofactor. what is consistent between the three models is that arg <dig> in fva is occluded by the binding of fxa, rendering this site inaccessible to apc cleavage . additionally arg <dig> is surface exposed and not masked by fxa in any of the models. as such, the structural models suggest that this arginine site could be accessible to apc cleavage even when fva or fvai species are complexed to fxa. however, mathematical simulations allowing the cleavage to occur in fva while bound to fxa overestimate both the rate of fvahc disappearance and the rate of generation of fva307-679/ <dig> fragment observed empirically . the data was best fit by modeling only the fxafvai <dig> complex as susceptible to cleavage at arg <dig>  thus the kinetic and structural modeling in concert with the empirical data suggests two effects: binding of fva to fxa blocks both cleavage at arg <dig> and arg <dig> despite the unmasked surface exposure of arg306; and that binding of fxa to fvai <dig> improves the geometry at arg <dig> rendering the site vulnerable to apc.

apc inactivation of factor va: effect of prothrombin
in addition to the protection afforded to fva by fxa in the prothrombinase complex, the substrate of the complex, prothrombin , has also been shown to inhibit apc inactivation of fva  <cit> . guinto and esmon reported that prothrombin protects the intact fva molecule by competing with apc for binding to fva  <cit> ; more recent studies have reported a kd of between 500– <dig> nm for fva and prothrombin  <cit> .

empirical analyses
in order to quantify the degree to which prothrombin protects fva from apc, reactions were carried out at physiological concentrations of fva  and prothrombin  on phospholipid vesicles . reactions were triggered with apc  and aliquots removed for western blot analysis . the presence of prothrombin in the system clearly protected fva from apc inactivation by  <dig>  nm apc. after  <dig> minutes 35 % of fvhc remained intact , compared to less than 5 % intact within  <dig> minutes in the absence of prothrombin . the initial rate of proteolysis of the heavy chain was reduced ~ 16-fold . the formation of the fva1- <dig> fragment  and rate of fva307- <dig> fragment  were both suppressed relative to reactions without prothrombin  suggesting both sites were protected. at  <dig> nm apc  the initial rate of fvahc proteolysis  is similar to that observed with  <dig>  nm apc in the absence of prothrombin . contrary to inactivation experiments in the absence of prothrombin , there is a more noticeable generation of the fva307-679/ <dig> fragment  that enables more reliable densitometric quantitation .

mathematical simulations
an additional reaction describing the reversible formation of the fvapt complex with a kd of  <dig> nm  <cit>  was added to the ordinary differential equation  network . the initial concentration of preformed fvapt complex, given  <dig> nm fva and  <dig>  μm pt, was calculated to be  <dig>  nm. simulated time courses for fva heavy chain fragments generated by apc  proteolysis did not correlate well with the empirical data, in fact suggesting that there would be little to no protection of fva by  <dig>  μm prothrombin if the kd was  <dig> nm . test simulations varying the kd were performed by altering the koff constant for the equilibrium describing the prothrombin and fva interaction. even when a kd of  <dig> nm was assigned to the interaction, ~ 10-fold less than published estimates  <cit>  the resulting simulations did not capture the observed level of protection .

in the computational model one of the assumptions is the presence of unlimited binding sites located on a single surface so that competition between proteins for occupancy of the phospholipid surface is not a factor. at  <dig> μm pc:ps vesicles, and setting the phospholipid/protein binding site ratio between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , available binding sites fall in a range between  <dig> and  <dig> nm. the simultaneous solution of the equilibrium expressions for prothrombin, fva, and apc  binding to phospholipid membrane with kd’s of  <dig> nm  <cit> ,  <dig>  nm  <cit> , and  <dig> nm  <cit> , respectively, shows that between 77– <dig> % of binding sites are occupied by prothrombin, over  <dig> % of the fva is bound, and only approximately  <dig> % of the apc is able to bind to the surface whether  <dig>  or  <dig>  nm apc is present. by using this bound fraction of apc as the catalytically relevant population, the mathematical simulations better captured the kinetics of fvhc proteolysis in the presence of  <dig>  μm prothrombin . similarly, comparison of empirical and simulated time courses for the three generated fragments  also show improved fits. our findings indicate that there may in fact be a tighter association between fva and pt, in line with the findings of yegneswaran et al.   <cit> .

to verify that the impaired fva proteolysis observed under the empirical reaction conditions was not solely due to competition for phospholipid binding sites, mathematical simulations were constructed using the adjusted apc concentration, but without permitting the formation of the fvapt complex. this model construct failed to predict the time courses for fvahc disappearance and the fragments fva1- <dig> and fva307-679/ <dig> . thus the computational studies indicate that the prothrombin dependent suppression of fva proteolysis by apc observed in our empirical reactions is due both to binding site competition  and to the fvapt complex not being a substrate for apc. comparisons of the empirical data for fvahc proteolysis  with the simulations representing unlimited binding sites , limited binding site adjustment but no fvapt interaction  and the limited binding site adjustment with fvapt complex formation   indicate that under these conditions approximately half of the observed pt dependent suppression is due to fvapt complex formation.

apc inactivation of factor va: effect of prothrombin and saturating levels of factor xa
empirical analysis
in order to measure the cumulative protection prothrombin and saturating levels of active site blocked fxa have on the apc inactivation of fva, reactions were carried out at physiological concentrations of fva  and prothrombin , with saturating levels of fxa*  on phospholipid vesicles . figure  <dig> summarizes the time course data for fvahc proteolysis by  <dig>  nm apc for reactions constructed with fva, fva + fxa*, fva + pt, and fva + fxa* + pt. the combined presence of prothrombin and fxa* provided maximum protection against apc inactivation.

addition of  <dig>  nm apc to the reaction system led to only 39 % of the fvahc being proteolyzed after  <dig> minutes . the initial rate of disappearance was  <dig> pm/s, nearly 41-fold lower than the inactivation rate in the absence of both prothrombin and fxa . inactivation studies with  <dig> times more apc resulted in a nearly 8-fold increase in the initial rate of inactivation  .

mathematical simulations
to incorporate the formation of the ternary prothrombinasesubstrate complex, four additional reactions are required . based on studies indicating that prothrombinase complexes formed with partially proteolyzed fva species have a km similar to the complex formed with intact fva  <cit> , we set the km of prothrombin for any prothrombinase complex to be the same and consistent with previous modeling studies  <cit> . we included two additional reactions  to allow for the dissociation of the ternary complex formed with some of the partially proteolyzed fva species. solving the simultaneous equilibrium of fva, fxa*, and pt in a lipid independent system, approximately  <dig>  nm fva is found in a prothrombinase complex , approximately  <dig> pm fva is in the fvapt complex, and approximately  <dig> pm fva is unassociated.

a values from previously published studies for mathematical simulations  <cit> .

simulated time courses for the disappearance of the fvahc were generated for the experiments where  <dig>  nm or  <dig>  nm apc was added. based on the findings from the apc inactivation studies of fva in the presence of prothrombin, apc effective concentrations were adjusted to 11 % of the total to account for the limited binding sites . the simulations’ initial rates of proteolysis of the fvahc  were less than half the measured empirical rates . the mathematical simulations greater level of protection extends through  <dig> minutes with higher amounts of fvahc anticipated compared to empirical results  . empirical studies were also conducted with 50 μm pc:ps vesicles and did not result in any significant changes in the initial rate or overall time course of fvahc proteolysis by  <dig>  nm apc , suggesting that under the current conditions, phospholipid membrane accessibility is not impeding the inactivation reaction.

potential explanations for this disparity include: 1) accumulated effect of small errors in rate constants; 2) improved binding of apc to the surface; 3) a misestimate of the affinity of the prothrombinaseprothrombin interaction; and 4) the affinity of human apc for fva is slightly higher, e.g. the kd is less than  <dig> nm. additional experiments will be required to distinguish between these possibilities. it is important to note that phospholipid composition plays an important role in protein-membrane interactions which can extend to effects on enzyme activity . several studies have directly highlighted the effect of membrane composition on the apc inactivation of fva  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed an ode based model of apc inactivation of the prothrombinase complex. this model includes  <dig> chemical reactions and interactions with  <dig> unique rate constants which describe the flux in concentrations of  <dig> species . we did so in stepwise fashion, analyzing the time course of fva inactivation in empirical reaction systems with increasing number of interacting components and generating corresponding model constructs of each reaction system. reaction mechanisms, rate constants and equilibrium constants informing these model constructs were initially derived from various research groups reporting on apc inactivation of fva in isolation  <cit> , in the presence of fxa  <cit> , and in the presence of prothrombin  <cit> . model predictions were assessed against empirical time course data measuring the appearance and disappearance of multiple fva degradation intermediates as well as prothrombinase activity changes, with experiments done multiple times, with plasma proteins derived from multiple preparations. current coagulation models that incorporate the protein c pathway  <cit>  provide an often simplistic one step inactivation reaction of fva by apc, without incorporating the feedback inhibition of the apcfva1-306fvalc complex, the ability of partially proteolyzed fva species to form catalytically active prothrombinase species, and the formation of fvapt species. they either do not provide empirical data verifying their model construct or rely on a single global output to validate the entire model construct. wagenvoord et al. have outlined the limitations of mathematical models of complex reaction networks validated by a single analyte  <cit> . this study highlights the complexity of the inactivation process and is a crucial step towards creating a module of equations describing the pc pathway that can be integrated into existing comprehensive mathematical models describing the interplay between procoagulant and anticoagulant processes during tissue factor initiated coagulation.
