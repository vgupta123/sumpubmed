BACKGROUND
messenger rna 3’end polyadenylation is an essential step for most of eukaryotic mrna biogenesis. it requires both cis-elements within a pre-mrna sequence and trans-acting factors consisting of dynamic and complicated polyadenylation complexes  <cit> . although 3’ end cleavage and polyadenylation could be performed with 10- <dig> proteins in vitro, mrna 3’ end processing is coupled with most steps of mrna biogenesis in vivo, from the initiation of transcription to the export of the mature mrna  <cit> . reflecting this, a recent study suggests that more than  <dig> proteins from different pathways of rna biogenesis associate with active polyadenylation complexes  <cit> . more interestingly, studies in recent years also suggest that 3’ end processing could serve as a robust step for regulating gene expression in higher eukaryotes by means of alternative polyadenylation , with which the same gene could produce multiple transcripts with varied stability, special rna motifs, and coding capacities  <cit> . indeed, apa was estimated to occur in more than 50% of human genes based on a genome level analysis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, more than 70% of genes have detectable apa sites  <cit> . similarly, both rice and chlamydomonas reinhardtii  have extensive apa sites, with the former being 80% and the latter 50% of their genes  <cit> . in genes that possess multiple sites, different patterns of poly site choice are seen in different tissues and different development stages, indicating that apa may be regulated by developmental or environmental cues  <cit> . while the molecular mechanisms of apa in regulating gene expression are largely unknown, there is evidence that both cis-elements and trans-acting factors are involved in apa  <cit> . in some tissues, there are isoforms of “canonical” polyadenylation factors functioning in the preferred apas of those tissues  <cit> . these data support the notion that multiple complexes, which likely share the core factors of polyadenylation machinery, operate in the polyadenylation of subsets of genes in response to different developmental and environmental cues.

our current understanding of polyadenylation mechanisms is largely from studies in human and yeast. the essential polyadenylation factors and cis-elements involved in in vitro 3’ end processing have been well defined in these organisms  <cit> . towards a better understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of plant polyadenylation, we have identified arabidopsis proteins similar to the essential yeast and human polyadenylation factors  <cit> . based on an array of protein interaction assays, including yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down, immunoprecipitation and affinity purification assays, the deduced interaction topology of those arabidopsis polyadenylation factors seems to be similar to those of yeast and human ones  <cit> . some arabidopsis  unique features, however, have been noted  <cit> .

in this report, we describe the plant orthologs of yeast and human polyadenylation factors from several representative organisms of the plant lineage. the results reveal several interesting features including the biased expansion of the genes encoding plant polyadenylation factors from “lower” to “higher plants” and variations in the composition of the polyadenylation apparatus across different species. they lend themselves to a model whereby the plant polyadenylation complex is dynamic and amenable to regulation and evolutionary changes.

RESULTS
the sets of genes encoding polyadenylation factor subunits vary in different plant genomes
previously, we identified and characterized arabidopsis thaliana proteins similar to subunits of yeast and human polyadenylation factors  <cit> . to extend these observations, and to better understand the nature of the polyadenylation apparatus in plants, we identified orthologs of yeast and human polyadenylation factors from several representative organisms of the plant lineage: arabidopsis lyrata, glycine max , vitis vinifera , populus trichocarpa , oryza sativa subsp. japonica , sorghum bicolor , brachypodium distachyon , selaginella moellendorffii , physcomitrella patens , and chlamydomonas reinhardtii . this collection of organisms was selected in part because of the availability of completed genome sequences, and because they represent different aspects of the plant evolution. thus, p. patens and s. moellendorffii are representatives of so-called “lower” plants while the “higher” plants are represented by the five dicots including closely-related  species , a legume , a tree , and three grasses . the selected “higher” plants should provide insight into possible differences between monocots and dicots. this collection also spans various of the large-scale genome duplications proposed to have occurred in the evolution of plants  <cit> .

the orthologs so identified are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the number of genes encoding polyadenylation factor subunit orthologs was greater in higher plants than in s. moellendorffii, p. patens and c. reinhardtii . the total number of such genes in higher plants ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  a range that probably reflects episodic large-scale duplications along with instances of gene loss. s. moellendorffii and p. patens possessed  <dig> and  <dig> such genes, while only  <dig> such genes could be found in the c. reinhardtii genome . the gene complements for each species are illustrated in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and described in more detail in the following section.

the complement of protein subunits and their encoding genes
cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 
in mammals, the canonical cpsf complex consists of four subunits of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kd. in plants, another subunit , related to cpsf <dig> as well as subunit  <dig> of the integrator complex , is recognized as a cpsf subunit, based on the copurification of this protein with other cpsf subunits  <cit> . fy  is also recognized as a part of this complex based on the same criteria  <cit> . for the most part, in plants, there are single genes that encode each of the six subunits of cpsf . the exceptions to this are the duplicates for cpsf <dig>  cpsf <dig>  and fy in g. max , the different numbers of cpsf <dig> genes that are seen in different species, and a partial cpsf <dig> gene in a. lyrata. interestingly, while c. reinhardtii possesses three genes that encode metallo-β-lactamase domain proteins similar to cpsf <dig> or cpsf <dig>  it lacks a probable ortholog of the product of the arabidopsis at2g <dig> gene .

another subunit that is considered a part of the cpsf complex in mammals is the hfip <dig> protein. in c. reinhardtii, and s. moellendorffii, there exists a single gene encoding fip <dig> orthologs while p. patens possess two such orthologs . these orthologs are identifiable by the presence of a conserved domain ; outside of this domain, these proteins diverge significantly from each other and from animal and yeast fip <dig> orthologs . the flowering plant lineages possess two distinct gene families whose protein products are related to fip <dig> . these genes are typified by the arabidopsis at5g <dig> gene, that encodes a well-characterized protein with substantial biochemical similarity with the human fip <dig> ortholog  <cit> , and the at3g <dig> gene .

cleavage stimulatory factor 
with few exceptions, the three subunits of the cstf complex are encoded by single genes in plants . cstf <dig> and cstf <dig>  are encoded by two genes in g. max, similar to what is seen with cpsf <dig>  cpsf <dig>  and fy. in addition, s. moellendorfii possesses two genes that encode probable cstf <dig> orthologs.

an addition class of protein that is related to cstf <dig> is also found in higher plants as well as s. moellendorfii; this protein is typified by the product of the arabidopsis at1g <dig> gene. this protein lacks the rrm domain found in full-sized cstf <dig> proteins  <cit>  but retains domains responsible for interactions with cstf <dig> and with factors that mediate transcription termination. higher plants have between one and three at1g73840-like genes that form a separate clade in amino acid sequence alignments . interestingly, s. moellendorfii also possesses a gene whose product retains the cstf77- and termination factor- interacting domains but lacks the rrm motif found in canonical cstf <dig> proteins. however, in sequence alignments, this truncated protein aligns more closely with the full-sized s. moellendofrii cstf <dig> orthologs than with the at1g73840-like proteins . p. patens and c. reinhardtii lacks these truncated cstf64-like proteins.

curiously, no obvious cstf <dig> orthologs could be seen in the c. reinhardtii or p. trichocarpa genomes . this is true even when tblastn is used to mine the respective genomes, ruling out the possibility that these genes have not yet been annotated . this observation raises the possibility that cstf <dig> may be dispensable for 3’ end processing in plants that possess the protein.

cleavage factor i 
in mammals, cfim is a heteromeric complex that consists of a larger and smaller subunit  <cit> . the two lower plants possess a single family of genes encoding the smaller subunit , while the higher plants possess two cfim <dig> gene families typified by the arabidopsis at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> genes, respectively . the p. patens cfim <dig> ortholog protein bears a closer resemblance to the at4g25550-encoded protein .

sequence alignments reveal that at least four distinct classes of the larger subunit of cfim  can be found in plants . one of these is specific to grasses, two are found in eudicots, and one is a collection of more distantly-related polypeptides, found in c. reinhardtii, p. patens, and s. moellendorffii, that cannot be clearly associated with any of the higher plant isoforms.

cleavage factor ii 
two subunits, the orthologs of yeast pcf11p and clp1p, constitute cfii in mammals. c. reinhardtii, p. patens, and s. moellendorffii all possess genes encoding pcf <dig> . higher plants possess two gene families that encode pcfs, typified by the arabidopsis at4g <dig> and at2g <dig> genes . the at4g04885-encoded protein possesses similarities to two of the three functional domains  of pcf <dig> , with little or no sequence similarity in the domain reported to function in the interaction of pcf <dig> with rna14/rna <dig>  the at2g36480-encoded protein lacks part of the n-terminal cid and also any noticeable similarity with the rna14/rna15-interacting domain of pcf <dig>  however, an adjacent gene located 5’ of at2g <dig>  encodes the “missing” section of the cid. the homologous rice gene  is a fusion of the two arabidopsis genes; there is est support for a single transcript from the rice gene . at the present, no such support can be found in arabidopsis est collections or after mapping of more than  <dig> million rna-seq reads .

some higher plants possess additional genes whose encoded proteins are somewhat similar to the clp1-binding c-termini of those encoded by at4g <dig> and at2g <dig> ; these proteins are typified by the products of the arabidopsis at1g <dig> and at5g <dig> genes. the occurrence of these is somewhat sporadic; they are not seen in the grasses or in two of the five eudicots in the study .

another cfiim subunit is the clp <dig> protein. for the most part, plants possess single genes encoding this subunit ; the exceptions are g. max  and a. thaliana and a. lyrata . one class of arabidopsis clps isoform  is related to the other plant clps proteins, while the other arabidopsis isoform  is less similar.

symplekin
p. patens and s. moellendorffii both possess single symplekin genes whose protein products resemble the protein encoded by the arabidopsis at5g <dig> gene . in flowering plants, there is a second class of symplekin gene, typified by the arabidopsis at5g27595/at5g <dig> gene , which seems originated from an intact symplekin gene being split by an intergenic region. the “split” nature of the at5g27595/at5g <dig> gene has been noted before  <cit> ; other higher plant orthologs do not share this organization.

poly polymerse 
c. reindardtii, p. patens, and s. moellendorfii all possess relatively simple pap gene families , with each organism possessing either a single isoform or two closely-related isoforms. in contrast, flowering plants possess an expanded suite of pap genes that can be sorted into four families . one of these families  is similar to the p. patens and s. moellendorffii pap proteins . one of the two additional families is typified by the arabidopsis at2g <dig> and at4g <dig> genes; like at1g <dig>  these encode nucleus-localized proteins  <cit> . with the exception of g. max, flowering plants possess two isoforms or paralogs of this second class of pap ; g. max possesses four possible paps2/4-encoding genes. again with the exception of g. max, one or two copies of a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic form of pap  can be seen in the flowering plants, but not in p. patens or s. moellendorffii . these three classes of pap are seen in all flowering plants. the three grass species possess an additional family of genes that may encode paps . as is the case with the paps <dig> family, these paps appear to lack nuclear localization signals . while all of the other higher plant paps genes share a common intron-exon organization  <cit> , this grass-specific family either lacks introns or possesses but a single intron whose position is not conserved in other paps genes . all of the predicted proteins seem to possess a functional catalytic site , but one of the b. distachyon isoforms has a deletion near the n-terminus of the putative primer-binding site.

poly binding protein – nuclear 
perhaps the most fascinating family of genes is that encoding plant pabn subunits . p. patens possesses four pabn genes that form a separate clade in amino acid sequence alignments . s. moellendorffii possesses two pabn genes that are distinct from the p. patens genes and those seen in higher plants. the grass pabn genes form yet another distinct group; interestingly, there seems to have been a duplication early in the evolution of monocots, yielding two sub-groups of monocot-specific pabn isoforms . there are two groups of eudicot pabn isoforms as well . one member of this group is typified by at5g <dig>  while the others are represented by at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> and form a distinct clade.

novel organization of genes encoding plant polyadenylation factor subunits
for some of the genes that encode plant polyadenylation factor subunits, novel or unusual gene organizations were seen. with the exception of c. reinhardtii, all of the plant cpsf <dig> genes possess the novel architecture seen in arabidopsis . thus, the plant cpsf <dig> genes encode proteins with three ccch-type zinc fingers and an extended domain that bears similarity to the so-called yth domain reported first in neuronal splicing factors  <cit> . this domain is similar to one  found in a family of arabidopsis proteins that interact with calcineurin b-like-interacting protein kinases  <cit> . in arabidopsis, cpsf30-encoding mrnas are alternatively processed, such that two proteins are produced. one of these consists just of a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide that includes the three zinc finger motifs but lacks the yth domain. the larger consists of the cpsf30-yth protein. besides arabidopsis, there is est evidence for a similar alternative processing in g. max .

in arabidopsis, a number of other genes that encode polyadenylation factor subunits exhibit a similar sort of alternative polyadenylation, in which some transcripts end within upstream introns . this is seen with fips <dig>  one symplekin isoform , cstf <dig>  and one of the two cfim <dig> isoforms . there is est support for similar alternative processing of fips <dig> transcripts in poplar, soybean, rice, and brachypodium .

in arabidopsis, one of the two symplekin isoforms is encoded by a split gene, at5g27595/at5g <dig>  <cit> . a similar situation is evident with one of the arabidopsis pcf <dig> orthologs; specifically, at2g <dig> encodes a polypeptide that lacks the very n-terminus of the pcf11-related polypeptide pcfs <dig>  while the adjacent gene at2g <dig> encodes the corresponding n-terminal segment . analysis of arabidopsis est sequences as well as high-throughput poly tag data  <cit>  indicates that the upstream gene encodes mrnas that are polyadenylated so as to yield the short mrna and thus predicted n-terminal segment . further analysis of rna-seq data failed to identify sequence tags that span the two genes . most of the other eudicot pcfs2-like genes are annotated as “split”, but none of the grass pcfs2-like genes are.

discussion
for the most part, the results described in this report indicate a broad evolutionary conservation of the polyadenylation complex, with plants possessing identifiable orthologs of all of the core mammalian polyadenylation factor subunits. however, there are interesting aspects of the sets of genes that encode these subunits in plants. thus, of the sixteen identifiable orthologs of the subunits of the core mammalian polyadenylation complex, seven are encoded by more than one gene in at least one of the plant species studied.  the subunits encoded by single genes are orthologs of the core subunits of cpsf and cstf. with two exceptions , subunits encoded by expanded gene families reside in other factors in mammals  or they play roles in the last step of the process  tail addition and poly length control). the degrees and evolutionary timing of expansion of the various gene families vary greatly, ranging from events that involved but one lineage  to those that occurred before the divergence of the higher plant lineages, but after the divergence of higher plants from selaginella.

these considerations lend themselves to a model where the plant polyadenylation complex consists of a core  that is rather rigid in terms of evolutionary conservation, and an associated panoply of peripheral subunits. these peripheral subunits likely do not all exist in a single large, monolithic complex, but rather associate in various and sundry combinations with the cpsf/cstf core; this is because many of the peripheral subunits are isoforms of other subunits and likely interact with the same site of the cpsf/cstf core, and thus are expected to assemble in mutually-exclusive manners. therefore, the polyadenylation complex may actually be a collection of somewhat distinct assemblies, each with different representatives of the products of the gene families. such a complex would be amenable to considerable evolutionary and physiological flexibility. different combinations of peripheral subunits may play dominant roles at special times during development, or in response to stresses. while not exactly analogous, this suggestion brings to mind the specialized functioning of the male-specific cstf <dig> and pap isoforms in mammals  <cit> .

this model may help to explain some of the poorly-understood features of the plant polyadenylation signal. this signal consists of three distinct cis-elements, none of which can be defined by a highly-conserved sequence  <cit> . of the eight protein subunits that are encoded by gene families in plants, at least four  are rna-binding proteins. if the different members of these families encode proteins with somewhat different rna sequence preferences, the sum of these preferences might be a degenerate, poorly-defined consensus. the sequence characteristics of the three cis-elements that have been defined by experimental and computational work would reflect a sum of the preferences of the individual rna-binding isoforms.

this model also has ramifications for possible mechanisms of alternative poly site choice in plants. for example, in mammals, pabn has been implicated in the differential recognition of weak poly signals that are often associated with promoter-proximal poly sites in genes whose de-regulation is associated with oncogenic transformation  <cit> . there is but a single pabn isoform in mammals; in contrast, plants possess several potential isoforms . this raises the possibility that different sub-complexes may possess different pabn isoforms, and that differential poly site choice would be accomplished by the action of sub-complexes of different pabn composition. the arabidopsis cpsf <dig> protein is inhibited in vitro by calmodulin and by sulfhydryl reagents  <cit> . should similar effects be manifest inside cells, then this protein should be inactivated in response to various stimuli. the possibility that the cpsf complex may be of variable composition, with cpsf30-independent configurations, would explain why polyadenylation could continue under such circumstances, and is consistent with a role for cpsf <dig> in alternative poly site choice mediated by differential inactivation of the protein. compositional variability would lend itself to additional modes of regulated poly site choice through the directed activation or inactivation of specific subunit isoforms. while little is known about this possibility in plants, mammalian orthologs of plant subunits encoded by gene families are known to be subject to modification by phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and arginine methylation  <cit> .

an additional layer of complexity in the plant polyadenylation complex is provided by the existence of “partial” protein isoforms, either through alternative rna processing  or coding by separate genes . these partial proteins possess some of the functionalities of their respective “complete” proteins, but not others; as such they may serve to affect the functioning of other subunits and thus redirect a subcomplex towards a subset of pre-mrna targets.

finally, it is noteworthy that, while conserved for the most part, the lower number and distinguishable sequence divergence of c. reinhardtii polyadenylation factors sets c. reinhardtii apart from the rest of the plant linage. interestingly, it has been demonstrated that c. reinhardtii and other green algae use a different set of poly signals where the uguaa motif in the near upstream elements is prevalent  over any other signals  <cit> . it is probable that the differences in polyadenyation factors contribute to the difference in poly signals, but it is difficult to pinpoint a single subunit as being responsible for the differences . further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
to summarize, the results presented here reveal both evolutionary conservation and novelty in the plant polyadenylation complex. they indicate that the subunit composition of the plant complex has undergone expansion  in the course of evolution, and that this expansion may have introduced much of this novelty. together, the data support a model whereby the plant polyadenylation complex consists of a relatively constant core and numerous combinations of peripheral subunits, such that the complex as a whole is actually a population of many different assemblies, which might explain the highly degenerate nature of the plant poly signals.
