BACKGROUND
lipophorins are insect proteins mainly involved in lipid transport, acting as a shuttle of lipids between different tissues <cit> . however, lipophorin has additionally been related to other functions, for example, it plays a role as juvenile hormone  binding protein in certain species, which suggests that it may contribute to the regulation of jh titers in the hemolymph  <cit> . during vitellogenesis, lipophorin transports lipids and other yolk precursors from the fat body to the ovaries and, in some species, lipophorin itself takes part of the egg yolk platelets  <cit> . lipophorin incorporates into cells through receptor mediated endocytosis  <cit> , and the first lipophorin receptor  was molecularly and functionally characterized in the locust, locusta migratoria by van der horst's group  <cit> . thereafter, cloning and sequencing of lprs has been reported for several insect species, such as the yellow fever mosquito aedes aegypti  <cit> , the wax moth galleria mellonella  <cit>  and the silkworm bombyx mori  <cit> . in a. aegypti, two splice variants of lpr specific to the fat body  and the ovary  have been characterized by raikhel's group  <cit> , and lprfb  have shown to increase after immune challenge, which suggests that lipid metabolism is involved in the mosquito immune response  <cit> .

in the german cockroach, blattella germanica, lipophorin is a high density lipoprotein with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda, composed of two apolipoprotein subunits of  <dig>  and  <dig> kda   <cit> . as stated above, the main role of lipophorins is transporting lipids through the hemolymph, and cockroach lipophorins have a substantial lipid fraction. in periplaneta americana, 50% of lipophorin mass are lipids  <cit> , and in b. germanica the lipid fraction represents 51%  <cit> . the occurrence of lipophorin in ovaries of b. germanica was reported by kunkel and pan in  <dig>  <cit> , and specific estimations of ovarian lipophorin contents were later published by schal and coworkers  <cit> , who additionally studied the role of lipophorin as hydrocarbon carrier from the hemolymph to the oocyte.

the present work aimed to characterize the lpr of b. germanica  in the fat body as well as in the ovary, not only regarding the receptor structure and organization, but also studying the function in the context of vitellogenesis. from a structural point of view, the obtained sequence of bglpr was characterized in terms of organization and comparison with other lprs. in addition, a phylogenetical analysis of lipoprotein receptors led to place lprs in an evolutionary context. furthermore, we determined the expression patterns of bglpr in the fat body and the ovary during vitellogenesis, we studied the influence of jh on bglpr expression, and we demonstrated the function of bglpr as receptor mediating lipophorin incorporation into growing oocytes, following rna interference  experimental approaches.

RESULTS
primary structure and organization of bglpr
a fragment of b. germanica lpr cdna was cloned by rt-pcr using ovarian and female fat body tissues as templates, and degenerate primers based on conserved motifs of known lpr sequences. then, 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cdna ends  was used to obtain two full-length sequences of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides, which encoded each of two proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> aa, with predicted molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, respectively. the two cdnas encoded identical proteins except for an insertion/deletion of  <dig> amino acids . blast analysis against databases suggested that the two proteins are lpr orthologues. therefore, they were called bglpr-s  and bglpr-l .

the putative start codon is preceded by an in-frame stop codon, indicating that these sequences represent full-length orfs. conceptual translation showed that both potential proteins  have a signal peptide , followed by a ligand binding domain  with seven cysteine rich repeats, preceding an epidermal growth factor  precursor homology domain, with type a, b and c cysteine rich repeats, containing the wxd repeats in number of five. the egf precursor homology domain is followed by an o-linked sugar region; in this region, both bglpr isoforms differ by the insertion/deletion of  <dig> aa . in the bglpr-s there is one nx  motif for the n-linked glycosilation of asparagine, whereas in the bglpr-l there are two of such motifs. of these two motifs, that which is closer to the 3' end is positioned  <dig> aa from the transmembrane domain, a distance which suffices for the glycosilation of asparagine  <cit> . then, there is a transmembrane domain, rich in aliphatic residues and with a gxxxg motif that breaks the α helix that could be formed by them. finally, there is a cytoplasmic domain having the clathrin-coated pit internalization motif fdnpvy. possible sites for co-and post-translational modification other than the o-linked sugar region, include  <dig> n-linked glycosylation sites  and  <dig> putative phosphorylation sites  on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues.

the organization and the primary structure of bglpr were compared with lprs of other insects . bglpr was most similar to the cockroach leucophaea maderae lpr with 81% of overall identity, and 92% identity when comparing the egf precursor homology domain. identity with respect to lprs of insects belonging to other orders was lower  .

evolutionary relationship of the bglpr and other lipoprotein receptors
in order to place the bglpr in an evolutionary context, we carried out a phylogenetical analysis of lipoprotein receptors available in the literature and databases. using maximum-likelihood approaches, and the so-called yolk receptor  of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and the vitellogenin receptor  of the tick dermacentor variabilis as out-groups, we obtained the tree shown in figure  <dig>  bglpr fall into a strongly supported  cluster of insect lprs. this cluster is the sister group of another strongly supported cluster  formed by vertebrate ldlr + lrp <dig> + vertebrate vgr-vldlr. the consistency of the lpr cluster allows to annotate the anopheles gambiae  and tribolium castaneum  sequences as lprs. interestingly, insect vgrs appear as a very external cluster, being the sister group of all the remaining lipoprotein receptors. the general good support of the all nodes allows to annotate the sequences of apis mellifera  and drosophila pseudoobscura  as megalin-like, the sequence of tetraodon nigroviridis  as ldlr, that of danio rerio , as fish vgr, and the sequence genbank™: xp_ <dig>  of t. castaneum, as insect vgr.

bglpr mrna expression
expression studies of bglpr in terms of mrna were carried out by rt-pcr followed by southern blotting, using a primer pair that amplifies the two isoforms. the weight of the amplified fragments was in agreement with the expected lengths:  <dig> bp for bglpr-s and  <dig> bp for bglpr-l. the two isoforms were detected in all tissues analyzed, namely fat body, ovary, brain, midgut, muscle, as well as in embryos .

in the fat body, mrna expression of the two isoforms during the vitellogenic cycle follow the same pattern, with low levels from day  <dig> to  <dig> , and higher levels from day  <dig> to  <dig>  and 7c  . the relatively high intensity of the lpr bands on day  <dig> is due to loading differences as shown by densitometry data with reference to the actin 5c band. in the ovary, bglpr-l mrna levels are high at the beginning of the adult stage but decrease thereafter, being very low on days  <dig> and  <dig> and during choriogenesis  . those of bglpr-s are very low during the first days, increase slightly in mid-vitellogenesis  and decrease on days  <dig> and  <dig> .

bglpr protein levels
firstly, a specific antibody for bglpr was obtained on the basis of a recombinant lpr fragment corresponding to the egf precursor domain , which is exclusive of insect lprs, and which was used to immunize new zealand female rabbits. using crude extracts of fat body and western blotting, the antibody recognized a single band with a molecular weight between  <dig> and  <dig> kda . the suitability of the antibody for bglpr recognition was further validated with rnai experiments. newly emerged adult females were treated with  <dig> μg of dsrna targeting bglpr , and fat body tissues were extracted  <dig> days later and analyzed in terms of mrna with rt-pcr, and of protein with western blotting. in dsbglpr-treated specimens, bglpr mrna levels dramatically decreased, as expected, whereas western blotting showed that the 97– <dig> kda band also resulted greatly reduced , which indicates that the band correspond to bglpr protein.

protein pattern of bglpr in the fat body  is roughly parallel to that of mrna , with low levels at the beginning of gonadotrophic cycle and higher levels from day  <dig> onwards. in the ovaries, the pattern of bglpr protein  is similar to that in the fat body, with low levels in previtellogenic stages, and higher levels during vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. this pattern contrasts with that of ovarian mrna , which is practically the reverse.

effects of jh on bglpr expression
bglpr protein patterns in the fat body and in the ovary are roughly parallel to the profile of jh production  <cit> . this suggests that jh may play a regulatory role on bglpr expression. to test this hypothesis, we treated newly emerged females with  <dig> μg of jh iii, and we examined bglpr levels  in the fat body and the ovaries  <dig> h later. mrna levels were not affected by the treatment in either of the two tissues . conversely, bglpr protein levels were higher in the specimens treated with jh, especially in the fat body . moreover, jh treatment also increased lipophorin levels  in both tissues .

interfering bglpr expression by rnai
in order to assess experimentally the function of bglpr, we carried out rnai experiments. interference of bglpr should presumably lead to a phenotype with less lipophorin, at least in growing oocytes. firstly, we aimed at checking whether rnai would decrease bglpr mrna levels. therefore,  <dig> μg of dsbglpr were injected into newly emerged adult females, and mrna levels were examined  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after the treatment in the fat body and in the ovaries. in the fat body, bglpr mrna levels decreased ca. 60%  <dig> day after the treatment, became very low  on day  <dig>  and slightly increased on day  <dig>  . in the ovary, lowering of bglpr mrna levels after rnai treatment proceeded more slowly. one day after the treatment mrna levels were similar to controls, but on days  <dig> and  <dig>  they decreased progressively, reaching ca. 60% reduction on day  <dig> .

in control females, lipophorin levels in the fat body are quite constant, comparing days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in dsbglpr-treated specimens, lipophorin levels were not reduced in the fat body, and even increased slightly on day  <dig>  with respect to controls . in the ovary of control specimens, lipophorin content increased progressively from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  as described previously  <cit> . in contrast with the fat body, lipophorin levels were reduced in the ovary  <dig> days after the treatment with dsbglpr , that is when reduction of bglpr mrna levels were maximal .

in spite of having less lipophorin in the ovary, dsbglpr-treated specimens had no special problems of fertility. in 6-day-old specimens, basal oocyte length was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  in controls, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  in dsbglpr-treated specimens . treated females oviposited and formed the ootheca one day later than controls, but the shape of the ootheca was identical in both groups. the number of nymphs emerging from the ootheca was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in controls, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in dsbglpr-treated specimens . nymphs emerging from the second ootheca were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in controls, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in dsbglpr-treated specimens .

discussion
two lpr showing the typical organization of a lipoprotein receptor have been cloned and sequenced from the cockroach b. germanica. the two sequences  differ only by an insertion/deletion of  <dig> aa located in the o-linked sugar domain. with the exception of these  <dig> aa, the two bglpr sequences are identical, not only in terms of amino acids, but also at level of nucleotide sequence, which suggests that they are splice variants of the same gene. splice variants differing by a short insertion/deletion in the o-linked sugar domain have been also described in the lpr of a. aegypti  <cit> , g. mellonella  <cit>  and b. mori  <cit> . whereas most of the available insect lprs have eight cysteine rich repeats within the lbd, the two bglpr isoforms have only seven. the fat body-specific lpr of a. aegypti and the single lpr reported in d. melanogaster  <cit>  have also seven cysteine rich repeats, and this has led to propose that the later could be fat body-specific  <cit> . however, the case of b. germanica shows that the occurrence of only seven repeats do not define fat body specificity, because bglpr-s and bglpr-l are expressed irrespectively in the fat body and in the ovary .

maximum-likelihood phylogenetical analyses show that lprs form a monophyletic group, and that lprs and the cluster formed by vertebrate ldlr + lpr <dig> + vgr + vldlr are sister groups. rodenburg and coworkers  <cit>  proposed that ldlr proteins can be classified on the basis of the amino acid sequence of their c-terminal domains. the analysis reported by these authors is represented by an unrooted tree, but the clusters obtained are similar to those described herein. the main difference between these two studies is that we used more sequences , and that our rooted tree allows a more visual reconstruction of the molecular evolution of the sequences involved.

in the fat body, mrna levels of both bglpr isoforms increase with time during the first vitellogenic cycle, whereas they decrease in the ovary. this suggests that the mechanisms regulating bglpr expression differ in these two organs. conversely, bglpr protein levels increase in parallel to vitellogenesis either in the fat body as well as in the ovary  <cit> . in the ovary, the bglpr pattern also resembles that of vitellogenin receptor  expression  <cit> . using western blotting, the antibody developed in the present work recognized a single band with a molecular weight between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, which is slightly higher than that predicted for the heavier bglpr-l isoform , a difference that might be due to posttranslational modifications. rnai of bglpr resulted in a clear decrease of this band, which indicates that it corresponds to bglpr. the fact that only a single band is revealed by the antibody suggests that only one of the isoforms is translated, as occurs in the lpr of g. mellonella, were only the splice variant containing the full o-linked sugar domain is translated into the receptor protein  <cit> . we cannot exclude the possibility that the isoform not present in the fat body and the ovary is translated and plays a tissue-specific role in other tissues or stages were bglpr is transcribed .

treatment with jh increased the levels of bglpr protein, especially in the fat body, but not those of bglpr mrna. posttranscriptional effect of jh upon bglpr could be related to mrna stability, mrna transport or the own translation rate. antecedents of posttranscriptional effects of jh on protein expression have been described in a. aegypti. in this mosquito, jh enhances the synthesis of 8ftz-f <dig>  an orphan nuclear receptor involved in the acquisition of competence to 20-hydroxyecdysone by the fat body to produce vitellogenin  <cit> . in g. mellonella, production of lpr protein is also hormonally enhanced, but by 20-hydroxyecdysone  <cit> . our experiments also showed that jh-treated specimens had higher levels of lipophorin, estimated in terms of apolipophorin i . however, this likely derive from the increased levels of bglpr, given that jh do not seem to regulate lipophorin levels directly  <cit> , although in the ovary, higher levels of apolpi can also be due to the enhanced basal oocyte growth provoked by the treatment with jh.

in order to demonstrate the function of bglpr as lipophorin receptor, we interfered bglpr expression by systemic rnai, studying the effects in the ovary and the fat body. in the ovary, bglpr mrna levels decreased progressively after the treatment with dsbglpr, and on day  <dig> they were clearly lower than in controls . on the same day, lipophorin levels in the ovary of dsbglpr-treated females were much lower than in controls, as expected. in controls, and as previously described  <cit> , lipophorin contents in the ovary increase in parallel to vitellogenesis. the situation in the fat body is more complex, because this organ not only internalizes but also synthesizes lipophorins. three days after the treatment with dsbglpr, bglpr mrna levels practically vanished in the fat body, but lipophorin levels were almost indistinguishable from controls. three days later, levels of bglpr mrna and lipophorin contents increased. this double increase suggests that knockdown effects began to disappear. expression recovery of the target gene after dsrna treatment, which has been described in other systems, like in the eye color gene vermilion in the locust schistocerca gregaria  <cit> , suggests that rnai must be used carefully when suspecting that the resulting phenotype can be transient.

CONCLUSIONS
rnai experiments demonstrate that the bglpr cloned and sequenced in b. germanica is a functional lipophorin receptor. expression studies and experiments with jh, suggest that expression of bglpr is posttranscriptionally regulated by this hormone. phylogenetical analysis indicates that insect lprs form a well supported monophyletic group. our functional studies on a cockroach based on rnai, together with functional studies based on biochemical approaches on locusts and mosquitoes, strongly supports the notion that the lpr group is formed by functionally active lipophorin receptors.
