BACKGROUND
listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive, non-sporulating foodborne infectious pathogen. the pathogen can cause serious diseases, such as septicemia and meningitis, especially in high-risk groups  with a high mortality rate of 20–30%  <cit> . l. monocytogenes is ubiquitous in nature; it can survive under conditions of high salt and low ph. because, it can grow even at low temperatures, the bacterium can be found in many kinds of foods during storage  <cit> . in particular, ready-to-eat  foods, which do not require heat cooking, are a main source of foodborne listeriosis cases  <cit> .

internalin a  plays an important role in l. monocytogenes invasion by attaching to host cells  <cit> . however, some l. monocytogenes strains express a truncated form of inla, which lowers the invasion rate  <cit> . truncated inla, caused by a premature stop codon  in inla, often lacks the lpxtg motif that anchors inla to the surface of the pathogen, leading to a decrease in invasiveness  <cit> . some reports have shown that inla-truncated strains account for 35–45% of l. monocytogenes in rte foods  <cit> . however, aside from invasiveness, the virulence of these mutated strains has not been studied.

our previous study showed that an inla-truncated strain had wild-type prfa, which regulates the expression of virulence related genes  <cit> . on the other hand, tèmoin et al.  reported that all of  <dig> inla-truncated strains analyzed had the same amino acid sequence mutations in the migration factor plca and the invasion factor inlb <cit> . however, approximately  <dig> genes are related to the l. monocytogenes infection cycle  <cit> , and most of them have not been investigated in strains with truncated inla. a small number of studies have investigated virulence-related genes in inla-truncated strains  <cit> ; the studies do not completely explain the virulence of the strains.

this study aimed to identify the major virulence-related gene sequences present in inla-truncated strains. in recent years, the analysis of bacterial whole genomes has become faster and easier with the development of next-generation sequencing methods such as pyrosequencing. in this study, we used pyrosequencing to construct a draft sequence of strain 36-25- <dig>  and we compared  <dig> main virulence-related genes in the inla-truncated strain and a clinical wild-type strain.

RESULTS
presence of virulence-related genes
after de novo assembly of the reads for strain 36-25- <dig>  the total contig length was  <dig> ,538 bp with a peak depth of  <dig> . the contigs aligned to  <dig> ,194 bp of the egde whole genome sequence, and showed  <dig> % identity .

*the number in the parentheses shows the peak depth of de novo assembly results.

in strain 36-25- <dig>   <dig> open reading frames  showed high similarity with the  <dig> egde virulence-related genes, indicating that strain 36-25- <dig> has all of these genes.

comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the virulence-related genes
nucleotide mutations were found in  <dig> genes  of strain 36-25- <dig>  when compared to egde . substitutions of 1 bp were found in dlta, gtca, and inla. the mutation in iap was an insertion of 12 bp .

in the allelic type columns, the amino acid residues are described in the parenthesis.

in dlta, thymine was changed to cytosine at position  <dig> of the orf. this mutation is a silent mutation, which does not cause an amino acid sequence change . on the other hand, the mutation in gtca is a missense mutation, which affects the amino acid sequence; substitution of thymine with cytosine position  <dig> changed the phenylalanine in egde to serine in strain 36-25- <dig> . the inserted region in iap is a tandem repeat sequence. whereas egde has  <dig> repeats of the acaaat motif, strain 36-25- <dig> has  <dig> repeats, resulting in  <dig> additional threonine-asparagine  repeats . among the genes analyzed, a nonsense mutation was found only in inla .

mutation of virulence-related genes in other inla-truncated strains
the  <dig> genes, in which the nucleotide sequences differed between strain 36-25- <dig> and egde were also sequenced in other inla-truncated strains . the silent mutation in dlta was found in all of the inla-truncated strains . on the other hand, the missense mutation in gtca found in 36-25- <dig> was not found in the other inla-truncated strains . as for the tandem repeat of the acaaat motif in iap, strains lma <dig>  lma <dig>  and lma <dig> had  <dig> repeats; strain lma <dig> had  <dig> repeats .

discussion
virulence-related genes in strain 36-25-1
the contig of the 36-25- <dig> strain constructed by de novo assembly showed similarity as high as  <dig> % in the regions that aligned with the egde strain. in addition, this strain possessed all of the  <dig> virulence-associated genes analyzed. the genus listeria is considered to have lost virulence-associated genes as it differentiated from ancestors that showed virulence  <cit> . multiple virulence-associated genes are missing in strain 4a, a serotype of l. monocytogenes showing no virulence  <cit> . because strain 36-25- <dig> possesses all of the  <dig> genes investigated in the present study, we conclude that the inla-truncated strain has not undergone changes that have resulted in any major loss of regions present in the clinical wild-type strain.

virulence-related genes with mutations
among the  <dig> virulence-associated genes in strain 36-25- <dig>   <dig> genes possess a sequence identical to that of the corresponding gene in the egde strain. therefore, we conclude that the virulence of these genes is the same in the 36-25- <dig> and egde strains. nucleotide sequence differences were found in only  <dig> genes .

dlta is a part of the dlt operon, which is composed of  <dig> genes that function in the addition of alanine to lipoteichoic acid   <cit> . experiments using a strain in which dlta was artificially inactivated suggest that dlta influences the electric charge of the bacterial surface to increase adhesiveness to host cells  <cit> . the dlta mutation found in strain 36-25- <dig> is present in all other inla-truncated strains examined in this study. whether or not this mutation is characteristic of inla-truncated strains requires investigation of other clinical wild-type strains. however, this mutation does not influence the phenotype of these strains as a silent mutation.

similar to dlta, gtca is involved in the addition of a saccharide to lta  <cit> . in the present study, the nucleotide sequence of gtca in strain 36-25- <dig> differed from that in the egde strain, and the encoded amino acid sequence differed as well. however, this mutation is not common to inla-truncated strains: the mutation was not found in the other inla-truncated strains examined.

the mutation in iap is in the tandem repeat region, in which the number of repeats has been reported to vary even among clinical wild-type strains  <cit> . p <dig>  encoded by iap, is involved in the movement of l. monocytogenes inside a host cell and in cell-to-cell propagation  <cit> . p <dig> possesses multiple lysm motifs at its c-terminus, which are used to bind to the cell wall of l. monocytogenes, and an sh <dig> structure at the n-terminus exposed outside the cell  <cit> . the iap mutation in strain 36-25- <dig> occurred between the lysm domain and the sh <dig> structure. therefore, we conclude that this mutation has almost no influence on the functions of these domains.

pathogenicity of inla truncated strain
the results of the present study indicate that, except for inla-mediated cell invasiveness, virulence in the inla-truncated 36-25- <dig> strain is almost equivalent to that in a clinical wild-type strain. however, these results differ from those of a study by témoin et al. , which demonstrated that  <dig> virulence genes, including inla, were simultaneously truncated  <cit> . in addition, van stelten et al. , after orally administering an inla-truncated strain to guinea pigs, reported that only the translocation rate to the spleen was lower in the truncated strain, when compared to a clinical wild-type strain  <cit> . moreover, in the study by olier et al.  using a strain that originally showed virulence but was genetically modified to express truncated inla, the mortality of chicken embryos infected with the transformed strain was lower than that of chickens infected with a clinical wild-type strain  <cit> . these reports indicate that aspects of virulence other than cell invasiveness differ between inla-truncated strains and clinical wild-type strains; this cannot be explained by the results of the present study. therefore, we expect that mutations in the virulence-associated genes of inla-truncated strains will exhibit heterogeneity. the results from inla-truncated strains other than strain 36-25- <dig> in the present study support this hypothesis. in addition, many l. monocytogenes genes have functions that are not yet elucidated. hence, we cannot exclude the possibility that genes not analyzed in the present study contribute to the differences between inla-truncated strains and clinical wild-type strains. analyzing other inla-truncated strains and determining the unknown functions of l. monocytogenes genes will resolve these questions.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we analyzed the major virulence-associated genes in strain 36-25- <dig>  an inla-truncated strain. with the exception of inla, the virulence-associated genes in the inla-truncated strain are almost identical to those in a clinical wild-type strain. the results indicate that a slight mutation in the nucleotide sequence, such as a pmsc, determines the virulence of inla-truncated strains. in addition, post-translational analysis of each gene indicated that, except for inla-mediated cell invasiveness, the virulence of the 36-25- <dig> strain is equivalent to that of clinical wild-type strains. however, this result does not completely explain the results of previous studies on inla-truncated strains. to clarify the relationship between virulence and genes in inla-truncated strains, analyses of more inla-truncated strains, including pyrosequencing, and studies of gene expression are required to understand the virulence of inla-truncated strains deeper.
