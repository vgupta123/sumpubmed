BACKGROUND
most animals rely on olfaction for foraging, predator and toxin avoidance, and social interactions. odorants are detected by 7-transmembrane receptors, which normally transduce olfactory signaling by activating g-proteins. however, recent work in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster demonstrates that insect odorant receptors  act as ligand gated  <cit>  and cyclic nucleotide gated  <cit>  cation channels, and thus do not function as traditional g-protein coupled receptors. the gα protein responsible for inducing the production of cyclic nucleotides that activate cation channels formed by or-complexes have not been identified, although gq has been implicated in drosophila olfactory transduction  <cit> . another gα protein, go, is expressed in the odorant receptor neurons  of antenna from drosophila, the silk moth bombyx mori, and the mosquito anopheles gambae, suggesting the functional involvement of go in insect olfaction  <cit> . although definitive immunohistochemical proof for dendritic localization of go in olfactory sensilla is lacking, previous studies could not rule out the possibility of go expression in orn dendrites.

in drosophila, the s <dig> subunit of pertussis toxin  selectively adp-ribosylates go, thereby inhibiting go signaling  <cit> . we have employed existing and newly developed tools for controlling the spatial and temporal expression of ptx to investigate how go inactivation affects physiological responses to odorants  <cit> . loss of go signaling in orns reduced the amplitude and enhanced the termination of eag responses, and decreased odor-induced spike frequency in individual orns independent of odor type or concentration. these results demonstrate that go is involved in modulating olfactory responses in drosophila.

RESULTS
to determine whether go signaling mediates olfactory responses, eag measurements were carried out on flies in which the widespread olfactory receptor neuron driver or83b-gal <dig> was used to drive uas-ptx in orns  <cit> . conditional expression of ptx was achieved using the gal80ts <dig> target system; at 18°c, functional gal80ts <dig> binds to and inhibits gal <dig> and at 32°c gal80ts <dig> is inactivated thus allowing ptx expression  <cit> . at 32°c, or83b promoter driven gal <dig> was free to drive the transcription of ptx and inactivate drosophila go  <cit> . as a result, gal80ts20/or83b-gal4; uas-ptx/+ flies, which show a ~ <dig> mv eag amplitude to 10- <dig> ethyl acetate at 18°c, produce a significantly  decreased eag amplitude of ~ <dig> mv at 32°c . this result demonstrates that ptx-sensitive go is needed for high amplitude eag responses, suggesting that go is involved in generating receptor potential. to insure that the observed decrease in eag amplitude did not arise from cell damage and/or cell death, we placed temperature-treated flies to 18°c for  <dig> hours and measured eag responses. these flies regained normal eag amplitude of ~ <dig> mv, demonstrating that the effect of ptx is reversible . moreover, eag responses evoked by 10- <dig> ethyl acetate in gal80ts20/+; uas-ptx/+ and or83b-gal4/+ control strains did not show a decreased  amplitude when the temperature was increased from 18°c to 32°c , thus decreased amplitude does not result from an increased temperature. temperature did induce a moderate increase in eag amplitude in gal80ts20/+; uas-ptx/+ control flies, but this is likely due to the gal80ts <dig> transgene genetic background since gal80ts20/+ flies displayed a modest increase in eag amplitude when temperature was increased to 32°c .

to confirm that ptx suppressed eag amplitude, ptx was conditionally expressed in orns by combining the gal4/uas and tetracycline -inducible tet-on transactivator  systems  <cit> . or83b-gal <dig> was used to drive expression of uas-rtta  in orns. in the presence of the tetracycline analog doxycycline, rtta binds to the tet-operator  and activates transcription of the teto-ptx transgene. upon addition of doxycycline, ptx expression suppressed  eag amplitude by ~40% . to insure that ptx suppressed eag amplitude by inhibiting go, a ptx insensitive goα  was expressed along with ptx in orns. doxycycline-induced ptx expression did not affect  eag amplitude in flies expressing pigo in orns, demonstrating that pigo completely rescued the action of ptx on endogenous go . these results map the effects of ptx to go and confirm that go signaling contributes to olfactory responses.

to investigate the effect of ptx on eag dynamics, we looked at fall time constant  as a measure of the termination kinetics of eag responses. fall time constant is the time necessary to recover one-third of the maximal eag amplitude after stimulation. this parameter is independent of amplitude, and unlike amplitude τf remains relatively unaffected by small changes in electrode placement  <cit> . upon stimulation for  <dig> ms with 10- <dig> ethyl acetate, τf was significantly  lowered in the gal80ts20/or83b-gal4; uas-ptx/+ flies at 32°c compared to that at 18°c, whereas the two control strains showed no effect  of temperature on τf . for a given odorant, τf decreases if either the concentration of the odorant or its delivery duration is reduced  <cit> . inhibition of go resulted in faster termination kinetics typically seen in control flies upon application of a 10-fold lower dose of odorant . since inactivation of go shortened τf, it can be argued that transduction of odor-information in the antenna was impaired in absence of go. our observation that go is needed for the persistence of the electrophysiological response in vivo corroborates the in vitro results that implicate g-protein mediated signal amplification in prolonged odor signaling  <cit> .

odor-induced eag responses are thought to mainly consist of the summation of receptor potentials of many orns in close proximity to the recording electrode  <cit> . however, it is difficult to correlate eag responses with single cellular processes that occur when individual orns respond to odorants. the limited resolution of eags can be overcome by recording single unit responses from individual sensilla. in contrast to eag responses, single unit recordings consist of spikes that represent extracellularly recorded action potentials of individual orns in the sensillum  <cit> . to investigate the role of go at the level of single cell physiology, we performed single-sensillum recording on ab <dig> sensilla whose 'a' neuron  is known to robustly respond to ethyl acetate  <cit> . expression of ptx significantly  reduced the ethyl acetate-evoked firing frequency of ab1a spikes . however, the spontaneous firing frequency did not  change, indicating that inactivation of go did not alter the physiology of uninduced resting membrane . the same sensillum houses the co2-sensing ab1c neuron  <cit> , which does not express or83b-driven ptx. co2-induced single unit responses are not affected by or83b-driven ptx in ab1c neurons , thus confirming the specificity of our gene expression system. the reduction in ethyl acetate induced spike frequency was not a mere physical response caused by increase in temperature because the two control strains did not show any decrease  in firing frequency in response to increased temperature. inhibition of go signaling lowered the odor-induced frequency of ab1a spikes and odor-evoked eag response by an equivalent amount, i.e., 40-45% reduction in response. taken together, these results reveal that go plays an important role in olfactory reception within the drosophila orns.

to determine whether inhibition of go signaling impairs olfactory responses only at certain concentrations of ethyl acetate, we recorded eag responses in both ptx expressing and ptx non-expressing gal80ts20/or83b-gal4; uas-ptx/+ flies exposed to various concentrations of ethyl acetate . ptx was found to repress eag responses over a 1000-fold range of stimulus intensities ; although the degree of repression was slightly higher at high concentrations of ethyl acetate. this effect was in contrast with the odor-intensity dependent effect of dgq3rnai in behavioral response of drosophila to odors  <cit> . odor sensitivity was compared by noting the increase in odor concentration that is needed in go-compromised flies to elicit eag responses as high as that in flies with unaffected go. comparison of the two dose-response curves reveals that ptx mediated suppression of eag response is associated with a ~ <dig> fold difference in sensitivity to ethyl acetate .

we next determined whether go contributes to the detection of odorants by other classes of sensilla. we chose a small panel of odorants, which included two acetates  perceived by basiconic sensilla, one ketone  known to activate a single class of coeloconic sensilla, an alcohol  that is detected by trichoid and coeloconic sensilla, and another alcohol  that is detected by basiconic and coeloconic sensilla  <cit> . our odor panel contained both attractants  and repellents . eag recordings revealed that ptx expression significantly  repressed eag amplitudes to all five odorants tested . in each case, the eag amplitude was reduced by  <dig> ±  percent. these results suggest that go plays a role in olfactory signaling across multiple classes of sensilla independent of odor identity or concentration.

our results show that sensory signals from five odorants, including ethyl acetate, are modulated via go signaling. these findings support the possibility that a single odorant may activate multiple transduction pathways since previous studies showed that gq is needed for optimal responses to isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate and butanol  <cit> . activation of drosophila or cation channel function by multiple odorants implies that both or channel function and g-protein signaling are required for optimal responses to a given odor  <cit> . it is possible that odor bound ors directly activate go and gq, thus reinforcing and optimizing the orn response by modulating second messenger levels.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that go is required for maximal physiological responses to a diverse group of attractive and aversive odorants in drosophila. given that diminished physiological responses to odors persist in the absence of go signaling, it is likely that or channel function, along with g-protein signaling, are required for optimal physiological responses to odors.
