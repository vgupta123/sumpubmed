BACKGROUND
chromosomal dna replication in eukaryotic cells requires the complex interplay of a large number of essential and non-essential protein factors in a temporally- and spatially-coordinated manner. central to the enzymatic machinery at the replication fork is the mcm complex, a heterohexameric dna helicase composed of the related mcm2–mcm <dig> proteins  <cit> . in yeast, mcm is required for replication initiation at origins and for replication fork progression from origin to non-origin dna. mcm complexes are loaded onto dna in inactive form in g <dig> as part of the pre-replicative complex , become active in s-phase and move with replication forks with the same kinetics as the replicative dna polymerases  <cit> .

how activation of the mcm complex is regulated is not fully understood at present but both post-translational modification  and interactions with other proteins are believed to have important roles  <cit> . in the latter context, recent evidence points to the mcm helicase functioning as part of a complex  that comprises the cdc <dig> and gins proteins in addition to mcm  <cit> . the cmg complex possesses helicase activity and itself appears to be a central component of a larger protein structure, termed the replisome progression complex , that is assembled at replication initiation and disassembled at the end of s-phase  <cit> .

like mcm, both gins and cdc <dig> are required for the initiation of replication and for replication fork progression  <cit> . gins was first identified in functional genomic  <cit>  and genetic screens  <cit>  and is a heterotetramer whose four subunits  share a common evolutionary origin and protein fold  <cit> . single-particle electron microscopy studies  <cit>  have suggested that the gins complex adopts a c-shape structure that is distinct from the compact trapezoid structure determined by crystallographic methods  <cit> . although the precise molecular functions of gins and cdc <dig> are unknown, it has been shown that gins is required for formation and maintenance of stable cdc45-mcm interactions  <cit>  and that recombinant gins can bind dna in vitro  <cit> .

a detailed understanding of the architecture of the replication fork requires that methods be developed to visualise protein-protein interactions in living cells, ideally in a genetically-tractable organism. here we apply bimolecular fluorescence complementation  to this problem, for the first time using this method in the unicellular fission yeast s. pombe. bifc offers a powerful method for studying protein-protein interactions in living cells  <cit> . bifc is based on the ability of n- and c-terminal fragments of modified yellow fluorescent protein  to form a fluorescent complex when brought together by the association of two interacting partners. bifc provides therefore the opportunity to test for the association of two proteins in vivo, and also a method for examining the subcellular localisation of the interacting polypeptides. in contrast to the use of fluorescence energy resonance transfer  techniques, all this can be accomplished without the need for highly-specialised imaging equipment or sophisticated methods of data analysis  <cit> .

since its initial development and application in mammalian cells  <cit> , bifc has been shown to be effective in plants  <cit> , in filamentous fungi  <cit>  and in budding yeast  <cit> . here we report the results of the application of bifc to s. pombe for the first time. a series of plasmids has been constructed allowing for convenient c-terminal tagging of fission yeast proteins expressed from their correct chromosomal locations under the control of their native promoters. genes encoding the mcm <dig>  mcm <dig>  psf <dig>  psf <dig> and cdc <dig> proteins were then tagged with sequences encoding the n- and c-terminal domains of the engineered yfp protein venus  <cit> . using these tagged strains, we demonstrate interaction between psf <dig> and mcm <dig> proteins in haploid cells and mcm <dig> self-association in diploids. detergent extraction procedures are used to demonstrate that these interactions can also occur on chromatin in binucleate s-phase cells. our results demonstrate the utility of the bifc for studying the interactions between replication proteins in yeast cells. a related study reporting the application of bifc to study interactions between components of the origin recognition complex  in mammalian cells was recently published  <cit> .

RESULTS
in order to test whether bifc could be used in fission yeast, we first constructed pfa6a-based plasmids for pcr-mediated gene targeting in this organism  <cit> . open reading frames  encoding the n- and c-terminal domains of the engineered yfp protein venus  <cit>  were amplified by pcr from plasmids pbifc-vn <dig> and pbifc-vc <dig>  <cit>  and cloned separately into plasmids pfa6a-kanmx <dig>  <cit>  and pfa6a-natmx <dig>  <cit> . the latter carry kanmx <dig> and natmx <dig> antibiotic resistance cassettes, conferring resistance in fission yeast to g <dig> and nourseothricin respectively. figure  <dig> shows the schematic structure of proteins expressed from the tagging plasmids.

using pcr-mediated gene targeting method  <cit> , we attempted to tag genes encoding two of the four subunits of gins , two of the six subunits of mcm  and cdc <dig> in haploid cells. the sequences of the 100mer oligonucleotides used for this purpose are given in additional file  <dig>  in each case, we attempted to construct both vn <dig> and vc <dig> derivatives. eight of the ten desired strains were obtained by this method without difficulty . haploids expressing mcm2-vc <dig> and cdc45-vn <dig> were not obtained, suggesting that the bifc tag might detrimentally affect protein function in these cases.

next, the tagged strains were mated to one another in an effort to generate the thirteen possible vn173-vc <dig> combinations for bifc analysis. the products of the crosses were initially characterised by random spore analysis and later by dissection of meiotic tetrads, with the identity of the strains being determined by testing for sensitivity to g <dig> and/or nourseothricin and by pcr using specific primers . in total, we were only able to isolate double-tagged haploid strains from two of the thirteen possible combinations . the viable strains were psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> and psf1-vn <dig> cdc45-vc <dig>  in all other cases, tetrad dissection showed that the double-tagged strains were inviable . the reasons underlying the high degree of synthetic lethality observed in these crosses are unclear. while it is not uncommon for two apparently normal tagged strains to be inviable when crossed together, we cannot rule out the possibility that the lethalities we observe are a direct consequence of the extremely tight binding of the two domains of the yfp protein over long time periods  <cit>  preventing the timely dissociation of the interacting replication factors.

to visualise bifc signals, exponentially-growing cells were examined under the fluorescence microscope . no bifc signal was detected in psf1-vn <dig> cdc45-vc <dig> cells , suggesting that the n- and c-terminal fragments of yfp are insufficiently close to allow yfp complex formation or that topological constraints prevent this from occurring. in contrast, strong bifc signals could be detected with psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> but not in either parental strain or in the wild-type . the fluorescence signal was confined to the nucleus and was present in all cells in the population indicating that the two proteins interact in all phases of the cell cycle and not only during the short period of s-phase. this result was unexpected, as mcm and gins are not thought to interact with each other outside of s-phase, and may reflect a limitation of the bifc system, that once the two fragments of yfp are brought together through the interaction of their fusion partners  their tight binding may, as noted above, prevent subsequent dissociation of the complex, thus preventing investigation of the dynamics of gins-mcm interactions.

despite this, we also tested whether we could detect gins-mcm interactions on chromatin in fission yeast, by treating psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> cells with detergent to extract non-chromatin-associated material  <cit> , fixing with methanol/acetone and examining them for bifc . under these conditions, bifc signals were seen only in binucleate cells . in fission yeast, s-phase takes place immediately after completion of mitosis in undivided binucleate cells  <cit> . approximately 90% of binucleate cells displayed a clear bifc signal . thus the fission yeast psf <dig> and mcm <dig> proteins are able to interact on chromatin during s-phase.

we also investigated the effect of blocking dna replication on the psf1-mcm <dig> bifc signal. to do this, the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea  was added to cells in mid-exponential growth and samples analysed for chromatin-associated bifc following detergent extraction and fixation. by two hours after hydroxurea addition, ~80% of cells displayed chromatin-associated bifc signals . thus, psf <dig> and mcm <dig> remain associated on chromatin even when replication fork progression is blocked, consistent with results using aphidicolin-stalled replication forks in xenopus egg extracts  <cit>  or in yeast cells  <cit> .

to extend these observations, we endeavoured to examine the genetic requirements for the observed bifc signal by attempting to construct cut5-t <dig> psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> and sld3- <dig> psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> strains. the temperature-sensitive cut5-t <dig> and sld3- <dig> mutations might both be expected to disrupt the mcm-gins interaction. however, we found that the cut5-t <dig> psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> strain was inviable  and that sld3- <dig> psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> grew extremely poorly, forming microcolonies of very sick cells only after prolonged incubation at 25°c. growth in liquid ye medium was also extremely poor. as a result it was not possible to examine mcm-gins bifc in these cells. we also attempted to construct mcm4-psf <dig> bifc strains carrying additional mutations in the mcm complex using the cold-sensitive nda1-km <dig> and nda4- <dig> mutations . in both cases, the nda1/nda <dig> psf1-vn <dig> mcm4-vc <dig> strains were also inviable . these observations highlight once again the potential pitfalls of using the bifc system to study the dynamics of essential protein-protein interactions in living cells.

a number of studies have provided evidence that the mcm helicase is capable of double-hexamer formation and several models for mcm helicase action based on these observations have been presented . the biological significance, if any, of mcm-mcm interactions is unclear, however. to examine whether bifc could be used as a tool to address this issue, we constructed a mcm4-vn173/mcm4-vc <dig> heterozygous diploid strain by mating mcm4-vn <dig> and mcm4-vc <dig> haploids, neither of which a displayed bifc signal , and examined these cells under the fluorescence microscope. the mcm4-vn173/mcm4-vc <dig> cells displayed strong nuclear fluorescence  indicative of mcm4-mcm <dig> interactions in vivo in s. pombe. whether this reflects the existence in vivo of mcm double-hexamers or merely the close association of mcm single-hexamers within so-called replication factories remains to be determined, however. as with the psf1-mcm <dig> bifc signal observed in haploid cells , the mcm4-mcm <dig> signal was also observed on chromatin in binucleate, s-phase cells .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have used bifc for the first time in fission yeast to demonstrate interactions between the gins and mcm complexes in the nuclei of exponentially-growing cells and on chromatin in s-phase cells and when replication forks are stalled by nucleotide pool depletion. interactions between mcm complexes are also seen, with similar characteristics. whether this system can be usefully exploited to allow analysis of replication protein dynamics in living s. pombe cells remains to be seen however, as it is possible that the tight association of the two domains of yfp may interfere with the normal dynamics of the endogenous protein-protein interaction, presenting the risk of experimental artefacts. significant challenges lie ahead before the system can be validated.
