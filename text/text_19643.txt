BACKGROUND
dna methylation at the c <dig> position of a cytosine within a cpg dinucleotide is a primary mechanism in gene silencing  <cit> . approximately 60% to 90% of the cpg dinucleotides in the genome of a vertebrate are methylated  <cit> . 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine  exerts its demethylating function by sequestering dna methyltransferase  <dig>  to 5-aza-dc-substituted dna via the irreversible binding of the cysteine in the catalytic domain of dnmt <dig> to the  <dig> position of the cytidine ring . this decreases the cellular concentration of dnmt <dig>  which leads to genomic dna demethylation in the course of successive cell divisions  <cit> . 5-aza-dc has been shown to reactivate silenced genes in vitro  <cit> .

regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes also involves the acetylation and deacetylation of histones, followed by chromatin remodeling  <cit> . histones h <dig> and h <dig> are acetylated on the ε-amino groups of lysines to a greater extent than h2a or h2b  <cit> . histone acetylation increases the accessibility of nucleosomal dna to transcription factors and other regulatory molecules  <cit> . turnover of the acetyl groups on histone molecules occurs very rapidly in cells  <cit>  and the level of acetylation is controlled by an equilibrium of histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase  activities  <cit> . trichostatin a  is a reversible inhibitor of hdac in vitro and in vivo, active at nanomolar concentrations, that causes a marked increase in histone acetylation  <cit> .

dna methylation and histone deacetylation can be mechanistically linked in gene silencing  <cit> . for example, the silenced rrna genes can be re-expressed after either 5-aza-dc or tsa treatments  <cit>  but treatment with both drugs together does not result in additional re-expression, suggesting that dna methylation and histone deacetylation cooperate to silence rrna gene expression  <cit> . microarray analyses using human colorectal cancer cells showed that hdac inhibitors alone could re-express some genes, but not genes that contain hypermethylated cpg islands; genes with hypermethylated cpg islands were only re-expressed after 5-aza-dc treatment  <cit> . 5-aza-dc and tsa have been shown to act in a synergistic fashion to re-express silenced genes in colorectal carcinoma cells  <cit> .

the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hepg <dig>  <cit>  synthesizes and secretes many of the major human plasma proteins, such as fibrinogen, plasminogen, and α2-macroglobulin  <cit> . these cells exhibit many cellular features of normal human hepatocytes  <cit>  but also display characteristics resembling those of a fetal hepatocyte, because albumin and α-fetoprotein are both expressed; adult hepatocytes exclusively express albumin  <cit> . hepg <dig> cells also fail to express many of the hepatocyte-specific metabolic enzymes that characterize the neonatal and adult liver  <cit> . these cells express very low levels of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1b  and adh1c genes, both of which are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms in hepg <dig> cells  <cit> .

we were interested in determining what genes are regulated by dna methylation and histone deacetylation in hepg <dig> cells. affymetrix® hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarrays were used to measure the expression of approximately  <dig>  transcripts in the presence and absence of 5-aza-dc and/or tsa. we report that the expression of many genes was altered upon 5-aza-dc treatment, and many fewer with tsa treatment. groups of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and ccaat element binding were affected by 5-aza-dc . most of these genes are also expressed in the fetal and adult liver.

RESULTS
global gene expression in treated hepg <dig> cells
we treated hepg <dig> cells with 5-aza-dc to inhibit dna methylation, tsa to inhibit histone deacetylation, or the combination of both 5-aza-dc and tsa, and measured changes in gene expression using affymetrix® hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarrays. to ensure that 5-aza-dc treatments resulted in dna demethylation, we performed methylation-sensitive pcr on a site  <dig> bp upstream of the adh1b translational start site. if the site is methylated, it is resistant to hpa ii digestion and can be amplified by pcr; if it is demethylated, this site will be cleaved and can no longer be amplified. figure 1a demonstrates that genomic dna from untreated cells was methylated at the bp - <dig> hpa ii site, as demonstrated by the presence of robust  <dig> bp pcr products. dnas from 5-aza-dc-treated hepg <dig> cells had methylation levels less than one-fifth that of untreated cells, as evidenced by the absence of pcr products .

many genes were affected by the treatment of 5-aza-dc and/or tsa in hepg <dig> cells . the expression of  <dig> probe sets was changed by 5-aza-dc ,  <dig> by tsa , and  <dig> by the combination of 5-aza-dc and tsa  . hierarchical clustering of the microarrays based on a set of  <dig> genes that varied most across the experiment  showed a clear separation of cells that received 5-aza-dc from cells that did not . within this major division, cells treated with tsa did not segregate from untreated cells. thus, 5-aza-dc had a marked effect on gene expression while tsa had only a minimal effect. at a p-value of  <dig> , 5-aza-dc treatment increased the expression of  <dig> probe sets while decreasing the expression of  <dig> probe sets. tsa increased  <dig> and decreased  <dig> while 5-aza-dc plus tsa increased  <dig> and decreased  <dig>  additional file  <dig> shows genes for which any of the treatments significantly altered its expression .

gene re-expression in 5-aza-dc treated cells
dna methylation is known to play a large role in silencing the expression of many genes, thus we wanted to examine which genes in hepg <dig> cells were re-expressed by treatment with 5-aza-dc. we defined re-expressed stringently, requiring that the gene be undetectable  on any of the  <dig> arrays before treatment and detected  on all  <dig> arrays after treatment . treatment of hepg <dig> cells with 5-aza-dc restored the expression of  <dig> probe sets . only two genes were turned off by 5-aza-dc. the additional presence of tsa did not substantially change the number of probe sets  that were re-expressed. a relaxed definition of re-expression  resulted in an additional  <dig> probe sets being re-expressed by 5-aza-dc and  <dig> by 5-aza-dc and tsa. several genes regulated by imprinting were re-expressed or significantly up-regulated  by treatment with 5-aza-dc, including h <dig> , ndn , nnat , and meg <dig>  . the latter three genes were not detectably expressed in untreated cells; h <dig> was minimally detected in untreated cells but is clearly being re-expressed. another set of re-expressed genes included tspy <dig>  daz <dig>  and daz4; these genes are involved in spermatogenesis .

tissue culture and cancer cells are known to have an increase in genome wide methylation of cpg islands  <cit> . thus, we examined the frequency of cpg islands within the promoters of  <dig>  of the genes re-expressed by 5-aza-dc. using cpg island finder  <cit>  we found that  <dig> of  <dig> genes contained at least one cpg island. of the  <dig> genes whose expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr  we found that  <dig> contained at least one cpg island.

only four genes were turned on by the combination of 5-aza-dc plus tsa but remained off after treatment with 5-aza-dc or tsa alone . the most striking of these was chromogranin a , which is a central regulator of catecholamine storage and release  <cit> ; expression was not detected on any of the arrays for 5-aza-dc, tsa, or untreated cells but it was present on all  <dig> arrays from 5-aza-dc plus tsa-treated cells. we confirmed this synergism by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. the expression of chga was not reliably detected in untreated cells or in two samples of tsa-treated cells. expression was detected at very low-levels in two other tsa-treated samples and in all three 5-aza-dc-treated cells . cells treated with the combination of both 5-aza-dc and tsa showed greatly enhanced expression of chga, approximately 80-fold, illustrating the synergy .

groups of genes involved in liver processes are affected by 5-aza-dc
genes affected by 5-aza-dc treatment were further analyzed to determine whether the expression of particular groups of genes  was affected by dna methylation. we were initially interested in identifying groups of genes related to liver processes since this cell line is of liver origin . table  <dig> shows groups of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and ccaat element binding that are regulated by dna methylation; some genes are regulated by both dna methylation and histone deacetylation, but not solely methylation. many genes within these groups are also expressed in the developing fetal liver and adult liver .

verification of microarray results by quantitative real-time rt-pcr
quantitative real-time rt-pcr assays were performed to confirm microarray gene expression changes . genes were selected based on their role in the liver, imprinting status, cell cycle function, or as important transcription factors. the pattern of differences detected by rt-pcr was consistent with those from the microarrays, but the fold-changes obtained by real-time rt-pcr assays were, in most cases, much greater than fold-changes seen in microarray analyses. this observation was particularly true for genes re-expressed by 5-aza-dc treatment; in that case, the denominator in the microarray experiment  is essentially zero  so the exact fold change calculated from microarray data is not meaningful or accurate. rt-pcr assays allow one to obtain a lower baseline value, and therefore a higher fold-change. it should be noted that we have not determined the amplification efficiency of each assay so these calculated fold-changes are based on 100% efficiency; this can overstate the fold change.

discussion
dna methylation has a larger role in the inhibition of gene expression in the human hepatoma cell line hepg <dig> than does histone deacetylation. this is demonstrated by the greater effect by the dnmt inhibitor 5-aza-dc on gene expression than of the hdac inhibitor tsa, as evidenced by the numbers of probe sets with altered gene expression . it is also demonstrated by hierarchical clustering  in which the cells treated with 5-aza-dc, either alone or with tsa, segregated from cells not treated with tsa. 5-aza-dc treatment re-expressed  <dig> probe sets  that had been silent in hepg <dig> cells , and up regulated more genes than were down regulated. in the overall pattern of gene expression, we do not detect much synergy between 5-aza-dc and tsa on gene expression in these cells. a small number of genes  required both 5-aza-dc and tsa for re-expression; we confirmed the synergistic effects of 5-aza-dc and tsa on chga gene expression by performing quantitative real-time rt-pcr.

a subset of autosomal genes, known as imprinted genes, display expression exclusively from one of the parental alleles  <cit> . the imprinted genes ndn, nnat, and meg <dig> were turned on in 5-aza-dc-treated cells , demonstrating that the dna demethylation was sufficient to re-express genes silenced by dna methylation in the hepg <dig> cells. the expression of h <dig>  was greatly increased  while the expression of igf <dig>  was decreased . the most affected in the xenobiotic metabolism group, the cyp3a genes, play major roles in metabolic disposition of wide variety of drugs  <cit> . cyp3a <dig> and cyp3a <dig> comprise nearly 30%-40% of total hepatic cytochrome p <dig>  <cit>  while cyp3a <dig> expression is restricted to the fetal liver  <cit> . cyp3a expression in untreated hepg <dig> cells is fairly low , suggesting that their expression is reduced in these partially de-differentiated cells; however, 5-aza-dc greatly increased the expression of each cyp3a gene. this increase in expression was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr for cyp3a <dig> .

genes within the steroid biosynthesis group also included two cyp genes. the cyp19a <dig> gene, which was re-expressed by 5-aza-dc treatment , encodes the main estrogen biosynthesis enzyme, which converts androgen to estrogen  <cit> . cyp19a <dig> expression can be increased in endometriotic stromal cells upon in vivo down-regulation of c/ebpβ  <cit> . this finding is interesting given that c/ebpβ expression was decreased by 2-fold; this may contribute to cyp19a <dig> re-expression. the cyp17a <dig> enzyme  functions in the biosynthesis of testosterone through the regulation of 17-hydroxylase and  <dig>  20-lyase  <cit> . cyp17a <dig> is not expressed in the fetal or adult liver; hence dna methylation may be a major mechanism to transcriptionally silence its expression in the liver.

we examined seven genes that bind ccaat dna elements to regulate transcription of many important liver genes . most notable are the three genes encoding c/ebpα, c/ebpβ and c/ebpγ  that were differentially affected by 5-aza-dc or tsa and the combination of 5-aza-dc and tsa. surprisingly, the expression of cebpb and cebpg were decreased by 5-aza-dc; because methylation generally inhibits gene expression  <cit> , this down-regulation could be a secondary effect of the increase in an inhibitory factor. cebpa was up-regulated by tsa and the combination of 5-aza-dc and tsa, but not with 5-aza-dc alone. the transcriptional state of many other hepatocyte-specific genes in these cells is likely altered based on the expression profile of these c/ebp genes. cebpb can generate two isoforms from a single mrna: the full-length protein termed liver activation protein  or the truncated liver inhibitory protein  isoform  <cit> . lip is a dominant-negative factor that can attenuate transcription by forming a heterodimer with lap to negate the transactivation ability of lap  <cit> . lip is still able to attenuate the transcriptional activity of lap even when present at sub-stoichiometric amounts   <cit> . c/ebpγ heterodimerization with c/ebpα and lap can also attenuate transcription of c/ebp responsive promoters, suggesting dominant negative regulation by this factor  <cit> . hence, the decreased expression of c/ebpβ and c/ebpγ transcripts may aid in increasing the expression of the hepatocyte-specific genes they regulate.

the cebpa gene is regulated by histone deacetylation  in the hepg <dig> human hepatoma cell line. an increase in c/ebpα expression will increase the expression of several hepatocyte-specific genes that are regulated by this factor. however, a larger picture emerges from our data. hepg <dig> cells display many characteristics of fetal and adult hepatocytes. many genes regulated by dna methylation that function in liver processes  are expressed in the fetal and adult liver. dna demethylation may be, in part, responsible for silencing the expression of fetal liver genes. c/ebpα and c/ebpβ may play important roles in this. the haptoglobin  gene, which is important in liver development, is transcriptionally regulated by c/ebpα and c/ebpβ in the rat liver; dinic et al. have shown that hp transcription is regulated by c/ebpα during normal liver development while c/ebpβ regulates this gene during the acute phase response during the later phase of differentiation and in the adult  <cit> . also, the suppression of c/ebpα expression may be a prerequisite to biliary cell differentiation in a hepatoblast population in the developing mouse liver  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrate that dna methylation plays a much larger role than histone deacetylation in regulating gene expression in hepg <dig> human hepatoma cells. many genes were in fact turned on in these cells by the dnmt inhibitor 5-aza-dc; which included imprinted genes and spermatogenesis genes. 5-aza-dc affected groups of genes involved in liver processes such as xenobiotic metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and ccaat element binding. a majority of the genes in these groups are expressed in the developing fetal and adult liver indicating that dna methylation may play a role in restricting the expression of fetal liver genes and in shutting down expression in hepatoma cells.
