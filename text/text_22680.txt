BACKGROUND
baculoviruses are double-stranded dna viruses which infect insects from the orders lepidoptera, diptera and hymenoptera. significant baculovirus characteristics include the presence of two phenotypes during the cell cycle: budded viruses , and occlusion derived viruses  which are embedded into protein crystals called occlusion bodies ; they display very high diversity expressed in hundreds of species spread worldwide having different host ranges and/or virulence. four genera have been recognized: alphabaculovirus , betabaculovirus , gammabaculovirus , and deltabaculovirus  . the spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  has been classified into the baculoviridae family within the alphabaculovirus  <cit>  and has been extensively studied for its potential regarding the biological control of fall armyworm, an important pest causing economic losses regarding several american crops, mainly corn fields  <cit> . since the first reports about sfmnpv  <cit> , work has been focused on studying its genomic constitution and the inter- and intra-population diversity by comparing different isolates. restriction profiles initially revealed genetic heterogeneity in field isolates, in addition to providing information for determining the first physical maps of the genome . sequencing of single genes and genomic variable regions  and subsequent analysis showed that sfmnpv phylogenetically clustered with other members of the group ii alphabaculovirus clade  <cit> .

four complete sfmnpv genomes have been reported recently, one from a field isolate   <cit>  and another three from genotypic variants recovered using in vitro plaque assay techniques in insects cells  . the sfmnpv-nicb isolate was the predominant genotype having the largest genome and both sfmnpv-3ap <dig> and sfmnpv-nicg had deletions regarding the former. phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were very closely related and also closely related to spodoptera exigua mnpv, agrotis spp. npvs and mamestra spp. npvs.

sfmnpv inter-population diversity evaluated in colombia by analyzing  <dig> isolates from three different geographical regions revealed that one isolate  had the highest prevalence . sfcol had minimal genetic differences compared to the sfmnpv isolate from nicaragua  based on restriction profiles; however, it had large differences regarding virulence against s. frugiperda larvae from colombia, sfcol being more potent than sfnicb for the local insect population  <cit> . subsequent intra-population diversity studies have revealed  <dig> different genotypic variants within sfcol , sfcola being the most prevalent  and having the largest genome, while the other variants had different sized deletions. sfcola was  <dig>  times more potent than and as virulent as sfcol for local insect pests  <cit> . such biological differences should correlate with genome organization; structural mutations  would presumably be how baculoviruses evolve in nature and improve their fitness, not forgetting the importance of single nucleotide mutations. according to previous genome evidence, natural recombination events are probably one of the most important processes involved in baculovirus genome plasticity  <cit> . dna crossover may occur between two loci from one genome, between genotype variants of the same species, or between genomes from different virus species co-infecting the same host  <cit> . in any case, the resulting recombinant genomes may be affected by their prior gene content. baculovirus diversity has been associated with the ubiquitous presence of transposons, which may collaborate in horizontal gene transfer and insertion/deletion  mutations. different kinds of transposable elements have been detected in baculovirus genomes from many species, sometimes affecting gene functions  <cit> . baculoviruses should thus be efficient vectors between animals and such ability would have an important impact on gene content and genome organization because they can provide the sequence homology required for crossover events  <cit> .

baculovirus genome variability has an undeniable effect on the virus’ life-cycle in the host and affects different parameters such as pathogenicity, virulence and ob’s production   <cit> . some genome regions are more prone to sequence variation than others; these would include loci containing homologous regions  and bro genes, both being the kind of sequences recognized as target sites for intragenomic recombination because they are usually found in more than one copy  <cit> . moreover, most variability is concentrated in regions having auxiliary genes  as they are more tolerant to mutations because sequence changes do not affect the production of essential factors needed to complete the viral cycle.

the sfcola isolate was molecularly characterized in the present work to provide extra evidence to explain biological activities and to further understand how baculoviruses evolve in nature, losing ancient sequences or gaining new regions and thereby altering virus fitness.

methods
virus isolate
the virus used here  had been previously isolated by plaque purification in the sf <dig> cell line exposed to a natural sfmnpv isolated in colombia   <cit> . sfcola was propagated in s. frugiperda fourth instar larvae reared in laboratory conditions  and maintained as ob suspension in sterile distilled water.

sequencing, assembly and orfeome determination
sfcola dna was purified from obs by alkaline lysis and cesium chloride gradient  <cit>  and used for sequencing with the  <dig> genome sequencer  flx™ standard  . de novo assembly was performed using newbler assembler  to define whole genome sequence. the reads were independently assembled five times without using a reference genome; in all the runs the resulting sequence was essentially the same. this assembly was then compared to the genomes from baculoviruses which infect spodoptera spp.  and the genome organisation was conserved, thereby validating the previous result. the sfmnpv-cola assembly correlated with experimental physical map data and the region containing differential genes was confirmed by sanger sequencing. open reading frames  were identified using artemis  <cit> . atg initiated orfs having at least 150 nt  showing minimal overlap with other putative encoding sequences were selected for further analysis. blastn, blastp, tblastn, tblastx and psi-blast were used for homology searches  <cit> , initially against other sfmnpv genomes and then against other baculovirus species. homologous genes’ identity and similarity values were obtained by global alignment using clustalx  <cit>  with default parameters. the baculovirus genomic sequences used in the bioinformatics studies are listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> baculoviruses used in bioinformatics studies including sfmnpv cola

for detecting homologous regions  in the sfcola genome, the sfmnpv nicb hr- <dig> sequence was used as computational probe. all individual palindromes  were then recovered from sfcola, sfmnpv nic, sfmnpv 3ap <dig> and sfmnpv  <dig> genomes and multiple alignments were performed using the clustalx algorithm with default parameters. sequence logos were constructed using the weblogo server   <cit> . the secondary dna structure prediction was obtained using the mfold server of michael zuker website  <cit>  and using rnadraw program  <cit> . a/t-content was profiled using a sliding windows strategy   <cit> . relationships between each point and the a/t-content average were obtained and peaks of  <dig>  or above were considered as a/t-rich regions.

colinearity genome studies and phylogenetic analysis
nucleotide synteny blocks were searched using blastn routine with the following parameters: expected value =  <dig>  , penalty for a nucleotide mismatch = − <dig> , reward for a nucleotide match =  <dig>  and filter query sequence = false . output files for each genome comparison were drawn using the genomecomp v <dig>  software  <cit> . a color code was used for showing different ranges of nucleotide identity. baculoviridae phylogeny was inferred using the  <dig> core genes in silico translated from  <dig> baculovirus genomes  which were independently aligned using clustalx program with the following parameters: pairwise alignment ; multiple alignment . a concatemer was then generated by adding complete individual alignments and phylogeny was inferred using mega  <dig> software  <cit>  with the following parameters: upgma; bootstrap with  <dig> replicates; gap/missing data = pairwise deletion; model = amino ; patterns among sites = same ; rates among sites = different ; gamma parameter =  <dig> . besides, a phylogeny inference was similarly performed but using only sfmnpv genomes and the most related baculoviruses . the concatemer of individual alignments derived from  <dig> genes translated in silico which were shared among baculoviruses considered for the study .

interspecies horizontal gene transfer studies
the partial sfcola genome sequence, from chitinase atg to the gp <dig> stop codon genes, was compared to corresponding sfmnpv-b, sfmnpv 3ap <dig>  sfmnpv  <dig>  semnpv and spltnpv-ii regions to detect potential recombination events by running alternative methods. in the first one  <cit> , clustalx  was used for aligning sequence pairs, always involving the putative recombinant candidate  and one of the other sequences. relative similarities were calculated using the clustalx consensus symbol  as the input sequence, in an overlapping windows-based strategy. arbitrary values of + <dig> for identical  and − <dig> for non-identical residues  were set for obtaining similarity profiles. the sum of assigned values for each residue in each window  was divided by the window width and allotted to the central position to generate the plots. profiles were drawn and analyzed for detecting crossover points. different window lengths were scanned to find good relationships between graph complexity and crosspoint detection sensitivity. bootscan analysis   <cit>  was performed using the following parameters: window =  <dig> residues; step =  <dig> residues; gaps strip = on; replicates = 100; model = kimura 2-parameters; transition and transversion ratio =  <dig> ; phylogenetic method = neighbor joining). a g/c-content study was made for the same sfcola, sfnicb and spltnpv-ii genome region. g/c-contents were studied using a sliding window strategy . the profiles were adjusted using in-house software. for this a multiple alignment with the three nucleotide sequences was used as template and the adjustment of numerical profiles consisted in the introduction of blank positions interrupting the curve where there were indel events. sigmaplot v <dig> was used for all studies where final numerical profiles were represented and the putative crossover breakpoints were estimated. multiple alignment of homologous proteins was done to estimate kimura 2-parameter distances  <cit>  using mega  <dig> software with the following parameters: scope = pairs of taxa; estimate variance, variance estimation method = bootstrap method; n° of bootstrap replications = 1000; substitution model, substitution type = nucleotide, model/method = kimura 2-parameter model, substitutions to include = d: transitions + transversions; rates and patterns, rates among sites = gamma parameter, gamma parameter =  <dig> , pattern among lineages = same ; data subset to use, gaps/missing data treatment = pairwise deletion, select codon positions = all + noncoding sites.

sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> transcription studies
reverse transcription-pcr assays were performed to determine sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> transcription activities. forty five s. frugiperda second-instar larvae were kept fasting for  <dig> to 12 h at 26 °c and then allowed to drink from an aqueous suspension containing 10 %  sucrose,  <dig>  %  fluorella blue, and 1x <dig> obs/ml. larvae that ingested the suspension within 10 min were then transferred to individual plastic cups with semisynthetic diet. total rna was extracted from two infected larvae at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi using trizol reagent , as described in the manufacturers’ protocol. rna samples were then treated with rnase free dnase  prior to ensuring the absence of contaminant dna. first strand cdna synthesis was done using reverse transcriptase  and oligo-dt primer. the resulting cdnas were amplified by pcr with specific primers: sf <dig>   and sf <dig>   for orf023; sf <dig>   and sf <dig>   for orf024; sfpolh. <dig>  and sfpolh. <dig>  for the very late transcribed polyhedrin gene ; sfie- <dig>   and sfie- <dig>   for the early transcribed ie-o gene. the amplification products were resolved in 1 % agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide and uv exposure.

characterization of sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> proteins
different bioinformatics tools were used for determining the nature of sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> proteins. hydrophobicity profiles were constructed using a sliding windows strategy . several hydrophobicity scales were assayed . the presence of signal peptides was assessed by using signalp . putative functions were predicted using the hhpred server . secondary and tertiary structures were predicted using the local meta-threading-server  and the i-tasser server . sfcola orf <dig> secondary and tertiary structures were also predicted using the quark  ab initio prediction server. post-translational modifications were predicted by the interproscan tool .

RESULTS
the sfcola genome and gene content
five genomes have been sequenced to date from baculoviruses isolated from spodoptera frugiperda:  <dig> alphabaculoviruses  and  <dig> betabaculovirus  . the aforementioned polyhedroviruses were sequenced using a molecular cloning strategy followed by an automated sanger’s method; only the granulovirus involved using next generation-sequencing   <cit> . the colombian isolate’s  sfcola genotypic variant was molecularly characterized in view of its interesting biological properties to complete the study of the baculovirus group naturally infecting the armyworm and to provide extra information about baculovirus evolution. this genome  consisted of  <dig>  bp, and was covered  <dig> times by  <dig> sequencing, this being the first spodoptera frugiperda alphabaculovirus studied by the ngs approach. its size was revealed to be the largest regarding previously reported genomes where sfmnpv-nicb  was the previous head of the ranking. group ii alphabaculoviruses have a broad range of a + t content . sfcola had  <dig>  %, thereby agreeing with data published for the other spodoptera frugiperda nucleopolyhedrovirus .

analysis of the sfcola genome led to detection of  <dig> putative open reading frames  considering sequences encoding polypeptides having at least  <dig> amino acids, starting in an atg codon and having minimal overlap with the closest ones. thus the orfeome would cover  <dig>  % of the whole nucleotide sequence and each orf was numbered, starting at the polyhedrin gene  and continuing the numbering downstream polyhedrin stop codon. promoter motifs were searched, an early cakt initiator sequence   <cit>  was found in  <dig> orfs, irrespective of including the tata-box, while  <dig> orfs had a late inr motif  <cit>  and another  <dig> had both early and late elements. as expected, the sfcola genome contained the  <dig> core genes present in all baculoviruses and these sequences were thus identified using current denominations. the other putative genes were mentioned using the most accepted names based on their blast relationships regarding the annotated orfs from other baculoviruses  <cit> .

sequence homology analysis revealed that most orfs were shared among sfmnpvs, giving close to 100 % similarity but also revealing significant differences in one set of loci . sfcola 005/007/023/024/033/112/124/ <dig> orfs particularly required more in-depth study because they had less similarity than expected for genotype variants from the same species  or absence regarding their putative orthologs. the region including 005/006/ <dig> orfs might thus be a putative encoding location for expressing  <dig> small polypeptides annotated on only sfmnpv genomes . it is worth noting that orf <dig> is overlapped with orf <dig> and probably is not a gene considering the absence of typical promoter motifs and the small size of its theoretical encoded polypeptide. the proteins derived from orfs  <dig> and  <dig> had variability when compared to their orthologs from the other sfmnpvs due to mainly single or double nucleotide insertion-deletions causing frame shifts. what was striking about this unique sfmnpv region was the presence of direct and inverted repeats located on the flanks of a sequence shared with other group ii alphabaculoviruses. this region might thus be considered as non-coding  and could be associated with other viral functions such as genomic replication where this kind of sequence seems to be relevant  <cit> . sfcola orfs 005/006/ <dig> were annotated since the same was done in sfnicb, sf <dig> and sf3ap <dig> fig.  <dig> genome organization of sfmnpv cola. the illustrations show the sfcola loci where there are differences regarding other genotypes of this baculovirus species . in all cases, the snps , indels  and the annotated orfs  are highlighted in each locus. a region containing sfcola orf005/006/ <dig>  white boxes indicate sequences shared by alphabaculoviruses and direct repeats are shown as red triangles. b region containing sfcola orf023/ <dig>  sequences involved in gene replacement are shaded and the respective orfs located in that position are differentially colored . in sf3ap <dig> the orf <dig> ortholog of sfnicb and sf <dig> is annotated as orf <dig>  c region containing egt gene in sfcola, sfnicb and sf <dig>  the unknown gene annotated in all genomes downstream to the egt gene is orf <dig> in sfcola, orf <dig> in sfnicb, orf <dig> in sf <dig> and orf <dig> in sf3ap <dig>  the deleted region in sf3ap <dig> is shaded in grey. d regions containing sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig>  the orthologs of the first one in sfnicb and sf3ap <dig> are annotated as orf <dig>  the orthologs of the second sequence in sf <dig> and sf3ap <dig> are annotated as orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively. e region containing sfcola orf <dig> and orf131a. the orthologs in sf <dig> and sf3ap <dig> are orf 127a/ <dig> and orf 129/ <dig>  respectively. four snps and a deletion determined the absence of a coding sequence equivalent to sfcola orf <dig> in the genome of sfnicb. the p <dig> gene in sfnicb has an insertion of 60 nt. f genome representations of homologous region distribution



a very different situation occurred with sfcola orfs  <dig> and  <dig> ; both genes were not present in the other sfmnpv genomes, although these sequences have similarity with some group ii alphabaculovirus genes. by contrast, sfnicb, sf <dig> and sf3ap <dig> had one orf in that locus  that is not present in sfcola and had homology with other baculoviruses. this gene is present in the spfrgv genome  where the encoded polypeptide was hypothesized as being a soluble protein containing ring finger motifs  <cit> . such genome replacement  might thus be considered a recombination product as will be shown below.

another genome location having differences was the region containing sfcola orfs  <dig> and  <dig> because the theoretical polypeptides encoded by these genes had low identity and similarity values regarding the homologous sf3ap <dig> orfs  <dig> and  <dig> . this was due to deletion in the sf3ap <dig> genome affecting the corresponding carboxy terminal of the ecdysteroid udp–glucosyltransferase  gene  and the amino terminal of the other one .

sfcola orfs  <dig> and  <dig> also had lower similarity values than the expected ones when the in silico translated sequences were compared to the corresponding orthologs . both putative genes encoded unknown proteins; the former only had differences with sf <dig> because of a two single nucleotide deletion in this gene affected the reading frame annotated in the other sfmnpvs starting in a later atg. sfcola orf <dig> had differences with only sfnicb due to this sequence having a 5 bp microdeletion. the sfcola orf <dig> did not present an annotated ortholog in sfnicb . sequence analysis revealed  <dig> different nucleotides in the same stretch, including  <dig> nucleotide deletion affecting the reading frame, even though the region is present in sfnicb and other group ii alphabaculoviruses. in fact, in that location was annotated other orf  with similarity with acmnpv orf <dig> and semnpv orf <dig>  it is important to note that homologs of sfnicb orf <dig> are also present in the other genotypes of sfmnpvs, including sfcola, and were annotated as orf <dig> in sf3ap <dig> and orf <dig> in sf <dig>  for these reasons, in the genome of sfcola both putative coding regions were included as orf <dig> and orf131a .

regarding non-encoding loci, baculoviruses homologous regions  are sequence repeats which are dispersed throughout their genomes. all previously described sfmnpvs have 8 h interspersed in different locations; they are characterized by tandem repeats consisting of a 44 bp nucleotide stretch which include an imperfect 34 bp palindromic core. these sequences are variable; however, the local secondary structure motifs are very similar, constituting hairpin loops . the hr- <dig> has  <dig> repeats; hr- <dig>  hr- <dig> and hr- <dig> have only  <dig> repeat; hr- <dig> and hr- <dig> have  <dig> repeats and hr- <dig> and hr- <dig> have  <dig> repeats. it should be noted that sfcola lacked hr- <dig> since this sequence was located in the region where gene replacement occurred . sf <dig> lacked hr-5c and hr-5d, and sfnicb lacked hr-8a and hr-8b. two unique orfs  were annotated in sfnicb but the corresponding sequences were also present in sf <dig>  sf3ap <dig> and sfcola showing few single nucleotide polymorphisms. the locus containing sfnicb orf039a was located close to hr- <dig> while the sfnicb orf110a was close to hr- <dig> and both postulated encoding sequences were probably not real genes. all repeats from sfmnpv hrs can be summarized in a consensus sequence using the iupac ambiguity code: 5′ ynawsttdrctttyvdynahrhdybtbrnbdaaakymaaswtbr 3′. conserved nucleotides  would be a or t and probably essential for their role as replication origins and/or as transcription enhancers.

previous results were confirmed by a genome colinearity study showing high nucleotide sequence conservation and genome organization among sfmnpv genotypes . the exceptions included the locus where sfcola lost a ~1470 bp fragment and acquired another one of ~2970 bp , being similar to spltnpv-ii regions, and  <dig> small insertions present in only sfnicb. the first was 309 bp, located downstream to the odv-e <dig> gene and producing sfnicb orf057a. the second insertion was 73 bp, located in the intergenic region of sfnicb orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  and the third one was 60 bp positioned 437 bp upstream sfnicb orf <dig>  .fig.  <dig> nucleotide genome synteny. individual genome comparisons between sfmnpv cola  and the other genotypes of this baculovirus species , semnpv and spltnpv-ii are shown. genome sizes are represented as rules and a colored key is used to show similarity percentages. the locus where sfcola orf023/ <dig> are located is depicted as a black asterisk. the other asterisks indicate the locations where sfnicb has insertions . blue blocks in the middle of each graph indicate a + t rich regions



phylogenetic analysis was based on  <dig> concatenated core proteins derived from  <dig> baculovirus genomes ; as expected, the cladogram reproduced the grouping in  <dig> genera recognized in the current classification of the virus family  <cit> . sfcola and the other sfmnpvs formed a clade which was included in group ii alphabaculovirus, the closest species being semnpv and spltnpv-ii. special attention should be paid to other baculovirus isolates recovered from the same insect species, such as spodoptera litura, mamestra configurata, mamestra brassicae, helicoverpa armigera, helicoverpa zea, agrotis ipsilon and agrotis segetum npvs. by contrast with sfmnpv, some members of the previously mentioned set of viruses grouped in different clades, thereby reflecting their greater diversity. another inference was made regarding phylogeny, but only using the most closest related viruses based on  <dig> concatenated orthologous proteins . this study has revalidated the consistency of sfmnpv relationships with semnpv and spltnpv-ii  and has also highlighted the difficulty of finding groupings among the different genotypes of baculoviruses infecting spodoptera spp. since non-orthologous proteins were not included in these studies.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic inference for sfmnpv cola. a cladogram based on a concatemer built with the  <dig> core proteins obtained from  <dig> baculoviral genomes and sfmnpv cola. the phylogenetic tree was inferred using the mega  <dig> program. the four baculoviridae genera are indicated and alpha- , beta- and gammabaculovirus clades were collapsed to preserve space. b cladogram based on a concatemer built with  <dig> homologous proteins obtained from  <dig> baculoviral genomes including sfmnpv cola. the phylogenetic tree was inferred using the mega  <dig> program



interspecies horizontal gene transfer
the most important difference among sfmnpvs was the sequence acquisition which occurred in sfcola genome; this involved acquiring two genes from other baculovirus species and the loss of one gene present in all remaining molecularly characterized sfmnpv. a detailed study aimed at determining orthology with other baculoviruses showed that sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> were closely related to annotated spltnpv-ii orfs . these sequences from both genomes had higher than 95 % identity and similarity, similar to the value when comparing homologous proteins between pairs of sfmnpv genotypes . the study revealed that the orf <dig> had putative orthologs in group ii alpha- and betabaculoviruses while orf <dig> had homologs only in group ii alphabaculoviruses.fig.  <dig> protein relationships for sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  the relationships among two sfmnpv cola orfs and their orthologs contained in other viruses were calculated by blastp. related baculovirus species are shown  in filled circles . the blastp e-value between pairs of species is indicated above each arrow. a protein relationships for sfmnpv cola orf  <dig>  b protein relationships for sfmnpv cola orf  <dig>  ain: agipnpv; asn: agsenpv; haa: hearnpv aus; ha1: hearnpv c1; ha4: hearnpv g4; hag: heargv; han: hearmnpv; has: hearsnpv; hzn: hzsnpv; mc2: maconpv 90–2; mc4: maconpv a90-4; mbc: mabrnpv chb1; mbk: mabrnpv k1; mcb: maconpv b; pug: psungv; sen: semnpv; sfc: sfmnpv cola ; sfg: spfrgv vg008; sl2: spltmnpv g2; sln: spltnpv-ii; slt: splinpv an1956; xcg: xecngv



different approaches were used to explore the recombination hypothesis regarding recent sfmnpv and spltnpv-ii ancestors. the first one consisted in a relative similarity analysis between the genome region involved in the structural mutation from sfcola and the other sfmnpvs, semnpv and spltnpv-ii. poor similarity was revealed regarding the sequences in all the other sfmnpvs, although the chitinase  and gp <dig>  genes were almost identical ; by contrast, similarity increased when compared with semnpv  and reached the maximum value with spltnpv-ii . it is worth noting that the only sfcola region regarding the other sfmnpvs was very closely related to spltnpv-ii but that the upstream and downstream sequences had lower similarity values. another approach based on bootscaning analysis validated previous results showing that a recent ancestor of spltnpv-ii was the most probable dna donor involved in recombination .fig.  <dig> sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig> and  <dig> origin by horizontal transfer. the recombination process between sfmnpv cola and spltnpv-ii ancestors was studied by similarity plots and bootscanning analysis. genome regions analyzed were those containing sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  chitinase and gp <dig> genes. in all cases, colored arrows represent sfmnpv cola orfs. genome positions are indicated at the beginning and the end of the regions analyzed . similarity plots are indicated in black, and different colors  are used. a similarity plot between sfmnpv cola and sfmnpv nicb. b similarity plot between sfmnpv cola and sfmnpv 3ap <dig>  c similarity plot between sfmnpv cola and sfmnpv  <dig>  d similarity plot between sfmnpv cola and semnpv. e similarity plot between sfmnpv cola and spltnpv-ii. f bootscanning using sfmnpv cola, sfmnpv nicb, semnpv and spltnpv-ii



a g/c-content study was performed to demonstrate gene transfer by transposition in semnpv  <cit> . such approach not based on sequence alignments providing similar results to those aforementioned . the recombinant region’s g/c profile was more similar to spltnpv-ii than to the other sfmnpvs . by contrast, upstream and downstream regions  had a completely different pattern, having similar values to the g/c-content average . kimura 2-parameter  distances were estimated to further support the idea of recent recombination . this approach revealed a very close relationships between sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> regarding spltnpv-ii orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively, expressing distances larger than  <dig>  but smaller than  <dig> . this range of values is currently assumed as an interval in what complementary information is needed to determine whether two sequences are different or genotypes of the same species  <cit> . the present study thus revealed that the sequences flanked by chitinase and gp <dig> genes in sfcola and spltnpv-ii genomes would belong to baculovirus isolates from the same species; by contrast, the other genes from both genomes were revealed to be sequences of two different baculovirus species.fig.  <dig> g + c profile into the locus containing sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  the g/c-contents  of sfmnpv cola, sfmnpv nicb and spltnpv-ii were analyzed in the locus of each genome where the recombination process occurred. profiles are shown with different colors referenced in the graph. a representation of coding regions  is featured above the histogram. grey boxes do not represent sequences and are used to facilitate understanding the graphical positions of chitinase and gp <dig> genes among analyzed genomes

all the aforementioned analysis suggested that recombination occurred between recent sfmnpv and spltnpv-ii ancestors, involving the end of the chitinase gene and the start of the gp <dig> gene, causing the replacement of ~1470 bp  for ~2970 bp carrying  <dig> complete genes having great similarity to spltnpv-ii  <dig> and  <dig> orfs and a truncated gene similar to spltnpv-ii orf <dig>  breakpoints seemed to be inside the reading frames for the chitinase gene  and the gp <dig> gene  restoring the continuity of both frames. regarding the spltnpv-ii orf <dig> homolog in sfcola, a sequence analysis revealed  <dig> different deletions  thereby resulting in a frame shift.

sfcola orf <dig> and orf024
whole rnas isolated at different times from s. frugiperda larvae orally infected with sfcola were examined by reverse transcription pcr to determine whether sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> were active transcriptional units . the very late sfcola orf <dig>  and the inmediate-early sfcola orf <dig>  were included for reference. single rt-pcr products were obtained having the expected sizes . this experimental approach showed that transcripts from orf <dig> appeared at  <dig> hpi while orf <dig> started at  <dig> hpi, a result in agreement with the presence of early inr promoter motifs .fig.  <dig> transcription kinetics of sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  spodoptera frugiperda larvae were exposed to sfmnpv cola and whole rnas were isolated from sacrificed animals at different intervals post-infection. then, cdna with polyt primer was generated for each sample and pcr assays were done using specific primers which amplify fragments of different orfs from sfmnpv cola genome . figure shows a photo cut-out showing the amplification bands resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. the sfmnpv cola genome was used as positive control and water was used as negative control



predictive studies were then performed for sfcola orf <dig> and orf <dig> proteins. the sfcola orf <dig> theoretical polypeptide thus consisted of  <dig> residues,  <dig> being negatively charged  and  <dig> positively charged amino acids . based on sequence, the molecular weight is  <dig> .1 da and the theoretical isoelectric point is  <dig> . the hydrophobicity profile suggested that this polypeptide was a soluble protein having average hydrophobicity of − <dig> . the secondary structure predicted by the lomets and i-tasser servers gave  <dig>  % coincidence, revealing the presence of  <dig> α-helices ,  <dig> β-sheets , and the remaining amino acids constituting loops or turns . the quark server predicted that orf <dig> would be a globular protein having a tertiary structure according to previous results . hhpred identified a region  as being a phosphatase domain similar to schizosaccharomyces pombe polynucleotide kinase  <dig> phosphatase  which plays a role in repairing single breaks in dna induced by several dna-damaging agents. interproscan identified  <dig> protein kinase c phosphorylation sites  and  <dig> tyrosine-kinase phosphorylation site . these post-translational modifications could be part of activation/inactivation processes, but require experimental confirmation.fig.  <dig> characterization of theoretical proteins derived from sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  the theoretical proteins encoded by sfmnpv cola orfs  <dig>  and  <dig>  were analyzed and the 3d structures were predicted. hydrophobicity profiles and predicted secondary structures are shown. alpha helices are represented as red cylinders and beta sheets as green arrows. the putative signal peptide  and transmembrane domains  are also shown



the sfcola orf <dig> theoretical protein consisted of  <dig> residues,  <dig> being negatively charged  and  <dig> positively charged amino acids . based on sequence, the molecular weight was  <dig> .0 da and the theoretical isoelectric point was  <dig> . the hydrophobicity profile suggested that this polypeptide would be a membrane protein having + <dig>  average hydrophobicity and having at least  <dig> transmembrane regions containing  <dig> α-helices and a signal peptide detected by signalp . the secondary structure predicted by lomets and i-tasser servers gave  <dig>  % coincidence, revealing the presence of  <dig> α-helices ,  <dig> β-sheets , and the remaining amino acids constituting loops or turns. coincidentally, the lomets server predicted a tertiary structure and a secondary motif distribution consistent with a transmembrane motif . hhpred identified one region  as a member of the major facilitator superfamily ; these proteins are permeases which act as secondary carriers in cell transport  <cit> . interproscan found several putative post-translational modifications, including 2 n-glycosylation sites ,  <dig> camp- and cgmp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site ,  <dig> protein kinase c phosphorylation sites  and  <dig> casein kinase ii phosphorylation site . these post-translational modifications could form part of protein function but experimental confirmation is required. it should be mentioned that the homologous protein encoded by the helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus  was not detected as a structural protein, suggesting that its role occurs within the infected cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
baculoviruses and other viruses having large dsdna genomes mainly evolve due to the accumulation of structural mutations  affecting gene content, where recombination or transposition appear to be the most relevant examples of mechanisms occurring in nature affecting dna integrity. analysis of complete baculovirus genomes has revealed a “core genome” represented by  <dig> genes encoding essential factors accumulating sequence variability since the last virus ancestor  <cit> . such pathogens carry sequences acquired from other entities defining a “plastic genome” which contains sequences included in all members of each genus and other regions present in only some species or variants. core genes usually produce key factors needed to complete a virus cycle, by contrast many encoding sequences in the plastic genome produce auxiliary proteins collaborating in virus processes even though not being essential for producing infectious progeny increasing fitness for them to perpetuate in nature. new technologies available for acquiring whole genome information have facilitated associating phenotype characteristics with gene content. the sfmnpv cola genome   <cit>  was thus sequenced having high coverage and compared to other genotypes isolated from other geographical regions.

the most relevant differences occurred in a locus where sfcola underwent recent sequence replacement, losing  <dig> gene and gaining  <dig> new encoding sequences. the genome location where recombination occurred has been described as hypervariable since sfmnpv variants have different deletions  <cit> . these regions include auxiliary genes such as ecdysteroid udp–glucosyltransferase , protein-tyrosine-phosphatase , chitinase and cathepsin whose products have activity affecting insect host physiology, development, behavior and integrity  <cit> . interestingly this location also contains hr- <dig>  a kind of sequences recognized as being a recombination facilitators  <cit> . by contrast, most of the other hrs were closer to core genes, thereby decreasing the fitness of natural recombinant viruses due to possible loss of essential functions. it is worth stressing that hr- <dig> was close to odv- <dig>  and f genes, hr- <dig> was near lef- <dig>  hr- <dig> next to alk-exo, hr- <dig> was close to lef- <dig> and hr- <dig> was near lef- <dig> and u-box/ring. the locus containing hr- <dig> thus seemed to be a hot genome region prone to undergoing structural mutations.

recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism which might be used as a viral strategy to gain advantage for maintaining adaptability to changing environments  <cit> . recombination could facilitate resistance to host range expansion . these kinds of interactions between genomes occur if two types of dna coexist in the same cell, have sequence similarities and they are replicating. artificial coinfections with acmnpv and bmnpv in larvae and in cell culture have shown that homologous recombination can occur between viruses belonging to two different species  <cit> . it has been reported that some spfrgv genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from other baculovirus species including spltnpv-ii  <cit> , such genome having been identified as dna donor for sfcola orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  spfrgv contains an orthologous gene for sfnicb orf <dig>  sf <dig> orf <dig> and sf3ap <dig> orf <dig> , the encoding sequence lost in sfcola. this would suggest that recombination occurred when these viruses co-infected spodoptera frugiperda larvae.

spodoptera litura and spodoptera frugiperda are polyphagous insect pests living on crops such as rice, corn, cotton and tobacco; they have been reported in subtropical locations in both the old and new world, although cross migration of both insects has been reported  <cit> . s. litura have been recorded in  <dig> species of host plant  <cit>  while s. frugiperda has been described in  <dig> such plants  <cit> , many of them shared between both lepidoptera. natural coinfection involving circulating variants of spltnpv and sfmnpv could thus occur in the same host. both species have similar sequences and genome organization, and it has been reported that spltnpv can infect spodoptera frugiperda-derived cells, such as sf <dig> and sf <dig>  <cit> . the above and bioinformatics evidence provided here support the hypothesis that homologous recombination is used by baculoviruses in nature to acquire variability. the sfcola genome would thus seem to provide natural proof for affirming that horizontal gene transfer is exploited by organisms and viruses to increase their fitness and thus acquire a reproductive success ensuring their permanence in nature.
