BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses are highly adaptable, able to evade host immune responses and to transmit among different host species. the segmented genome is composed of eight negative sense rna strands. segments  <dig> and  <dig> encode haemagglutinin  and neuraminidase , respectively. the external domains of ha and na are the major targets for host neutralizing antibodies and are used in the subtyping of influenza viruses. the other six are internal gene segments: the first three segments encode the viral polymerase complex: pb <dig>  pb <dig> and pa, and segment  <dig> encodes the nucleoprotein . these four proteins comprise the ribonucleoproteins , which are the core of the virion, with the viral negative stranded rnas packaged inside. segment  <dig> encodes both matrix protein  and ion channel protein . two separate non-structural proteins ns <dig> and ns <dig> are encoded by segment  <dig>  <cit> .

the structure of the virus genome allows for exchange among the eight rna segments between viruses co-infecting a cell, a process termed reassortment  <cit> . the viral reassortants derived from different virus subtypes can acquire completely new antigens  thus avoiding recognition by previously infected hosts and allowing for efficient transmission, leading to a pandemic  <cit> . three human influenza pandemics in the 20th century had either complete or partial avian origins: the h1n <dig> spanish flu in  <dig> appears to have been derived from an earlier avian source and both the h2n <dig> asian flu in  <dig> and the h3n <dig> hong kong flu in  <dig> were reassortants between human and avian strains  <cit> . genetic reassortment also played a prominent role in the origin of the swine-origin influenza a   <dig> virus  <cit> .

wild avian species of wetlands and aquatic environments such as the anseriformes  and charadriiformes  have been recognized as the major natural reservoirs of influenza a viruses where the viruses are maintained predominantly by asymptomatic birds, indicating a long-standing history of endemic infection  <cit> . terrestrial poultry, such as chickens and turkeys are not traditionally seen as reservoir hosts of avian influenza virus , but are susceptible to infection with wild-bird-derived aiv  <cit>  through exposure to fecal material from wild birds when they migrate through an area  <cit> . previous studies indicated that domestic ducks may act as intermediaries between migratory ducks and terrestrial poultry in southern china  <cit> , thus they could be thought as part of the larger reservoir within which different subtypes of influenza interact with each other  <cit> .

avian influenza a virus strains are classified as low pathogenicity  or high pathogenicity   <cit> . highly pathogenic strains primarily arise in subtypes h <dig> and h <dig> and are distinguished by the appearance of a highly basic cleavage site in ha  <cit> . genetic exchanges between viruses circulating in wild and domestic birds have been documented, usually involving lpai viruses in domestic poultry  <cit> . more rarely, hpai virus can be found to infect both wild and domestic birds, as seen in the case of hph5n <dig> avian influenza. since  <dig>  hpai h5n <dig> aiv spread from south china into southeast asia, causing sporadic transmissions to humans and tremendous damage to the poultry industry  <cit> . repeated spill-over of asian hpai h5n <dig> viruses from domestic to wild birds has also been observed, which demonstrates the potential for reverse flow  <cit> , and supports a close interaction between influenza strains in wild and domestic birds  <cit> .

the  <dig> ha subtypes and  <dig> na subtypes have allowed at least  <dig> of the possible  <dig> type a influenza a virus ha-na combinations to arise  <cit> , which indicates a high frequency of reassortment among different ha and na subtypes. however some subtypes are rarely detected, indicating that some restrictions on possible combinations may exist. thus, two important questions, regarding the general pattern of genetic interaction between different influenza a virus subtypes remain: whether certain subtypes are more likely to reassort than the other subtypes, and why this might be so.

recent advances in bayesian phylogenetics have provided methods which directly link patterns of genetic diversity to ecological processes, including changes in population size and substructure through time, allowing simultaneous insights into the spatial, temporal, and demographic dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogen populations, collectively described as “phylodynamics”  <cit> . the spatial phylodynamic process can be recovered from genomic data using phylogeographic analyses, allowing us to quantitatively study how and to what extent ecological features shape pathogen genetic diversity  <cit> .

unlike the dynamics of seasonal human influenza strains, characterized by a few co-circulating subtypes, little inter-subtype reassortment and broadly correlated evolution of lineages of the individual segments  <cit> , avian influenza has many co-circulating subtypes which caused a complex distribution of internal segment lineages  <cit> . conversely internal segment lineages have their own continuous histories, but with many different external segment partners  <cit> . here we will consider the patterns of acquisition and loss of the external protein coding segments on the backbone of each internal protein coding segment, since this represents the mechanism for generating antigenic novelty in a circulating population of viruses from the perspective of the internal protein coding segments.

with the aim of exploring the rate of genetic exchange among viral subtypes during evolution, we carried out a phylodynamic analysis of the influenza a viruses circulating in avian populations  from  <dig> –  <dig>  in particular, we focused on investigating how avian influenza segments specific to the ha, na and combined ha-na subtypes evolve on the backbones of the six internal gene segments, by quantifying the inter-subtype reassortment rates and testing possible ecological and evolutionary factors that are associated with such pattern of reassortment: the relative proportion of each host species, the inferred evolutionary relaxed clock rates and the selective constraint acting on the genes.

RESULTS
time-scaled phylogenies of internal genes of eurasian aiv
to explore how the ha and na subtypes reassorted with the internal segments of eurasian aiv, we used discrete trait models  upon empirical phylogenetic trees of the six internal gene segments. for reasons of computational tractability, we analyzed subsamples of  <dig> sequences generated using a stratified approach which maintained the range of genetic and subtype diversity. these were composed of  <dig> ha and  <dig> na subtypes and  <dig> combined ha-na subtypes respectively .

the reassortment history of eurasian aiv was inferred by discrete trait models  on phylogenetic trees. figure  <dig> shows the mcc tree of pb <dig> with branches colored by the ha subtype at the child nodes , and the other trees can be found in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the two most over-represented subtypes can be easily seen to form single subtype clades; colored green  and orange . however, it is apparent that some different subtypes were interspersed with each other, and the internal segments did not form monophyletic lineages with respect to antigenic subtype, indicating extensive reassortment between external and internal gene segments. a separation of two main clades can be seen in the pb <dig> phylogeny . the sequences in each clade cover a range of subtypes, host, sample location and time and do not correspond to the strains belonging to allele a and b in ns . in contrast, lower genetic diversity was observed in the remaining  <dig> gene segments  .

reassortment rates of discrete subtypes of eurasian aiv
a range of inter-subtype reassortment rates was found with respect to the internal segments of eurasian aiv. for both ha and na subtypes, there were  <dig> distinct states and thus each discrete trait model contained  <dig>  transition pairs . for the combined ha-na subtypes, there were  <dig> different possible transition pairs based on  <dig> distinct states . we analyzed the inter-subtype reassortment rate at three levels: rate per segment , mean rate per subtype  and absolute transition rate between pairs of subtypes .

in general, the overall reassortment rate at the segment level was slightly higher for the na subtypes than for the ha and ha-na combined subtypes . in addition, the reassortment rates of the combined ha-na subtypes  were related to the rate of the corresponding independent ha  and na  subtypes with p <  <dig>  in all six segments.

when comparing the reassortment rates among the six internal segments, we found the rates for five  were similar. among these np had a slightly lower and pb <dig> slightly higher overall rate for ha, na and the ha-na combined subtypes. in contrast to these five segments, the ns segment possessed significantly higher overall reassortment rates than those of the other segments .

we compared the mean reassortment rates of different subtypes, and found a substantial range among each subtype in all six internal segments and all three subtype traits . specifically, of the ha subtypes, h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> showed lower reassortment rates relative to the others, and h <dig> and h <dig> had the lowest rates in the six internal segments. by contrast, the reassortment rates of the h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> subtypes were high, especially for h <dig> with the ns segment, which had the highest rate  compared to all the others. for na subtypes, n <dig> and n <dig> presented lower reassortment rates compared to those of n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  for the ha-na joint subtypes, reassortment rates of h5n <dig> and h9n <dig> were considerably lower than with the other subtypes in all segments, and h9n <dig> had the lowest rates in the pb <dig> segment  and ns segment , while h5n <dig> had the lowest rates in the other segments ; other subtypes with low rates were h6n <dig>  h6n <dig> and h7n <dig> subtypes. in contrast, h1n <dig>  h3n <dig> and h4n <dig> and others exhibited high reassortment rates.

for clarity, the patterns of pairwise transition between individual subtypes are represented as a series of heat maps for the six internal segments in figure  <dig> . the inferred asymmetric reassortment transition rate matrixes are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the color intensity in each column reflects the rate with which each subtype  was found to reassort into a clade of other subtypes. the color intensity in each row reflects the rate with which the reciprocal events were inferred .

a range of reassortment rates were observed among subtypes as recipients, which indicates that each subtype possesses a different probability of giving the viral gene to viruses of other subtypes during co-infection. in comparison, the rates of subtypes as donors from the other subtypes were consistent which gives rise to the horizontal striping seen in the heat maps. the distinction between source and sink rates were further quantified by estimating the variance of rates in columns to the variance of rates in rows , which showed the variances were significantly smaller in the source to sink direction than the reverse. this pattern can be seen in the ha, na subtypes independently and in the ha-na combined subtypes, and is also similar in all six internal segments.

correlation of reassortment with genetic diversity
to further explore what factors are required to explain the pattern of reassortment rate in the segment level, we first tested the genetic diversity at the segment level which can be represented by the mean time to the most recent common ancestor  based on each phylogeny. the tmrca of three internal gene segments were quite similar and recent: pb <dig> :  <dig> - <dig> ), pa  and the m segment . the pb <dig> segment had an older mean tmrca, of  <dig>  years  while np was less divergent than the other segments . compared to the other segments, the tree topology of the ns segment was characterized by a very deep divergence between the two sub-lineages formed by the a and b alleles which represent two distinct gene pools, and consequently has a much older tmrca of  <dig> years  .

the association between genetic diversity and the overall reassortment rate of six internal segments of eurasian aiv was tested for ha, na and ha-na combined subtypes, respectively. the results  exhibited a strong positive correlation for the h subtype , the n subtype  and the h-n combined subtype .

correlation of reassortment rates with host
the prevalence of aiv in different avian hosts could also influence the reassortment pattern. the host prevalence of different subtypes was calculated from the subsampled data sets used to make the phylogenetic trees, which was proportional to the original data. the primary host difference lies between wild birds and domestic birds which live in completely different ecosystems. subtypes h1n <dig>  h3n <dig> and h4n <dig> had the highest prevalence in wild birds . we tested the association between individual reassortment rates and the proportion of domestic birds for the ha-na combined subtypes. we found that there was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of wild bird strains per subtype and the reassortment rates for those subtypes, and that the correlation held in each of the six segments .

dthe proportion of aiv with a domestic galliformes host.

the prevalence of aiv in different host species  was also analyzed. in this dataset, subtypes with a high reassortment rate also have the highest prevalence in anseriformes, which is the order representing birds living in predominantly freshwater habitats . we found a very strong positive correlation between reassortment rates and the proportion of anseriformes  , which may indicate the subtype with high reassortment rate could be better explained by their high proportion in waterfowl than wild birds. we further tested wild  and domestic anseriformes  separately . both of them show a strong positive correlation with reassortment rate per subtype .

on the other hand, subtypes h9n <dig>  h7n <dig>  h7n <dig> and h5n <dig> had a high prevalence in domestic birds of the order galliformes . there was a strong negative correlation between proportion of aiv in domestic birds of the order galliformes and rate of reassortment per subtype  .

correlation of reassortment rate with evolutionary rate
we further tested whether the reassortment rates were correlated with evolutionary rates of aiv at both segment and subtype level. the overall evolutionary rates of eurasian aiv in different segments were the relaxed clock rates per segment from the mcmc tree   <cit> . no significant difference in evolutionary relaxed clock rate was found among six internal genes of the analyzed aiv sequences, with estimated mean rates from  <dig>  to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions per site per year . in addition, no significant correlation was identified between overall reassortment per segment and evolutionary rate per segment .

the evolutionary rates in different subtypes were estimated by considering the relaxed clock rates corresponding to branches of particular subtypes. the rates per subtype were also similar between different subtypes in the same segment and not significantly different across different segments . there was no significant correlation between evolutionary rate and reassortment rate per subtype in each internal segment  , which is also confirmed by the distribution of correlation coefficients between the evolutionary rates  and reassortment rates . in addition, there was no indication of any interaction between evolutionary rate and the proportion of domestic birds .

correlation of reassortment with selection
finally, we estimated the total dn/ds ratio for each internal segment as well as the individual ratio per subtype in each segment . initial analysis of the coding regions in the five segments pb <dig>  pb <dig>  pa, np and m <dig> showed the dn/ds ratios were similar to each other with mean values from  <dig>  to  <dig> , indicating, as expected, that at the amino acid level purifying selection predominates in these internal segments; however, the ratio for the ns segment  was significantly higher than those of the other segments. this suggested a strong correlation between reassortment rate and dn/ds ratio at the segment level . however, this result is entirely dependent on the high value for ns <dig> and the correlation became negative and non-significant when ns <dig> was left out . compared to the evolutionary rate, the dn/ds ratio for each subtype differs noticeably between different subtypes in the same segment and is very different across different segments . for instance, in pb <dig>  h4n <dig> had the lowest dn/ds ratio  and h6n <dig> had the highest . in ns <dig>  h7n <dig> had the lowest ratio  and h7n <dig> had the highest ratio which was equal to  <dig>  but this difference was not significant given a wide range of statistical uncertainty for these subtypes in the ns <dig> segment. we found strong negative correlations between mean dn/ds and the reassortment rate per subtype in each of the six segments  .

bestimated dn/ds ratio per h-n combined subtype in each internal segment. mean dn/ds of each subtype on mcmc tree nodes with 95% ci of all mcmc samples are shown in brackets.

in order to confirm the negative correlation between the dn/ds ratio and inter-subtype reassortment rate seen in beast, we used the independent approach of single likelihood ancestor counting  in the hyphy package  to estimate dn/ds per subtype. we found a strong negative correlation between inter-subtype reassortment and dn/ds ratio in all six internal segments using slac as well . slac estimates the numbers of codons subject to positive and negative selection and we were thus able to identify the nature of the differences in selection. there was no evidence for positive selection contributing to the variation among subtypes, however there was substantial variation in the number of negatively selected sites, which was strongly negatively correlated with reassortment rate with r < − <dig> , p ≤  <dig> , for all segments except ns <dig> for which r = − <dig> , p =  <dig>  . therefore the intensity of purifying selection, or selective constraint, on the internal segments is strongly associated with the rate of reassortment.

in addition, we also found a strong negative correlation between the proportion of wild birds and the dn/ds ratio of different subtypes per segment . we then jointly estimated the partial correlation coefficients among dn/ds, host species and reassortment rates  <cit> . this showed that reassortment rate was still significantly negatively correlated with dn/ds independent of the proportion of wild birds as host in all six internal segments ; and independently positively correlated with proportion of wild birds as host  with borderline significance, thus both host and selective constraint are associated with reassortment rate.

discussion
we have systematically analyzed the evolution of internal segments of avian influenza viruses use a comprehensive avian influenza a virus dataset. using bayesian analysis of phylogenetic discrete traits within the integrated statistical framework in the beast software package, we quantified evolutionary parameters including reassortment rate, evolutionary relaxed clock rate and selective constraint for discrete. notably, the quantified pattern of reassortment illustrates how and to what extent the subtypes of aiv interact in the internal segments in bird populations. firstly, the overall inter-subtype reassortment rates are similar in five segments, while ns has higher rates overall, and secondly, in each segment, reassortment rates of different subtypes showed significant diversity and were asymmetric.

the reassortment rate of the six internal segments of eurasian aiv is significantly associated with gene diversity, which is probably due to the phylogenetic history and the biological function of the segments during virus infection  <cit> . here we identified that ns has a much more diverse phylogeny and higher inter-subtype reassortment rate than the other five segments of the avian influenza viruses of eurasian lineage. this result is in agreement with those of a previous study on aiv from the wild bird population of north america, which found extensive phylogenetic incongruence in the ns gene  <cit> . the ns phylogeny of avian influenza viruses is characterized by a deep divergence between the a and b alleles suggesting that the two alleles are subject to some form of balancing selection  <cit> .

while we found that reassortment rate was not associated with evolutionary rate, the segment-wide dn/ds ratio per subtype was strongly negatively correlated with the inter-subtype reassortment. the variation in dn/ds ratio was revealed by two independent methods: robust counting in beast  <cit> , and slac in hyphy  <cit> . the latter gives direct estimates of the numbers of selected sites from which it was seen that the variation between subtypes in dn/ds appears to arise from differences in the extent of purifying selection, as indicated by differences in the number of negatively selected sites for each subtype, which itself yielded a strongly negative association with reassortment rate . this suggests that the overall level of purifying selection, or selective constraint, differs between subtypes: more negatively selected sites indicating higher overall constraints leading to lower dn/ds.

as mentioned above, the evolutionary relaxed clock rates  in eurasian aiv show little difference among viral subtypes and also between the internal segments. in our results therefore, evolutionary rates were not correlated with inter-subtype reassortment rates and also not affected much by host species. this agrees with the conclusions of a previous study which indicated that the evolutionary rates in wild aquatic birds are not radically lower than those seen in poultry species  <cit> . pathogenicity status might also be an explanation of the lower reassortment rates of h5n1: hpai h5n <dig> is lethal to poultry  <cit>  thus could have had less chance to undergo reassortment in the host due to the short duration of infection of the birds as compared to the less symptomatic infection, typically of longer duration, in low pathogenicity strains. however, our results indicate that pathogenicity status  is not the major factor affecting the overall reassortment rate in all species; of those subtypes with high pathogenicity, such as h5n <dig>  h7n <dig>  h7n <dig> and h7n <dig>  only h5n <dig> has low reassortment rate; and there are other aiv subtypes with low pathogenicity that have low reassortment rate, most notably h9n <dig>  <cit> .

we show that the reassortment rates among viral subtypes are correlated with their prevalence in different types of host. high reassortment rates could be associated with high prevalence of certain subtypes in wild birds and particularly among anseriformes host species. in contrast, the lower reassortment rate of certain subtypes could be explained by their high prevalence in domestic birds . wild bird and domestic bird populations represent two different ecosystems: natural and artificial respectively, in which influenza viruses face different ecologic constraints such as host population structure density, and opportunities for virus transmission  <cit> . for instance, transmission by feces provides a way for wild birds to spread viruses to other wild birds as they migrate through an area  <cit> , while aiv in domestic birds, especially domestic birds of the order galliformes may exist in a more isolated population  than might occur in wild birds, thus with less possibility of reassortment.

in comparison to the aiv in domestic galliformes, aiv at high prevalence in the domestic duck  has a higher reassortment rate. domestic ducks or geese farming occurs in high-density but free-range settings in asia  <cit> . this farming style creates an environment in which migratory birds and domestic ducks are in close contact, and provide more opportunities for aiv to reassort  <cit> . in addition, different responses to virus infection may also influence the opportunity of aiv reassortment in certain host species. avian influenza virus in chickens  often leads to severe respiratory symptoms and high mortality rates of up to 100%. in contrast, aiv infection generally causes no major clinical signs and immune response in ducks   <cit> . different influenza virus subtypes can also infect wild ducks concomitantly, creating the opportunity for genetic mixing  <cit> . those subtypes showing the high reassortment rates in our study, especially h1n <dig>  h3n <dig> and h4n <dig> represent the most common subtype combinations that are found in wild ducks during periods of peak prevalence and have a maximum detectable subtype diversity in the late summer and fall  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we quantified the inter-subtype reassortment rates using discrete trait modeling upon time resolved phylogenies with respect to all six internal segments of eurasian aiv. the overall reassortment rates for the external protein coding segments on internal protein coding segments were highly correlated with the internal segment genetic diversity  and negatively correlated with dn/ds ratio and selective constraint. in addition, we found that different subtypes are characterized by reassortment rates that are strongly dependent on host type . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that lack of immunological cross-protection at the subtype level in avian species allows frequent mixed infections in wild bird populations and provide novel insights into the evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses.
