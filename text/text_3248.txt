BACKGROUND
during mammalian central nervous system  development, multipotent precursor cells  undergo division, cell fate specification, and maturation in response to extrinsic cues. these neural stem cells are characterized by the ability to undergo cell division and to differentiate into multiple cell types, e.g. neurons or glial cells.

there are two major sources of adult neural stem cells within the adult brain: the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone   <cit> . svz-derived nscs can be cultured as self-adherent cell clusters called neurospheres  <cit> . such 3d neurospheres can be kept in culture for several passages without losing their proliferation, migration and differentiation capabilities.

until the 1990s, all studies of neural stem cell proliferation were limited to examining the proliferation of precursors in embryonic tissue. recently, several isolation and culture protocols have been established that have enabled proliferation to be studied in cultured adult neural stem cells  <cit> . it is noteworthy that under normal conditions, proliferation  is tightly controlled. cytokine-induced cell death and dysfunction play an important role in the pathogenesis of a variety of disease conditions, including brain inflammation. however, cytokine production within the adult brain is strongly up-regulated by inflammation. this response has been well described in demyelinating diseases, e.g. multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, viral or bacterial infection, trauma and ischemia  <cit> . much of the inflammatory signal transduction can be considered as an innate immune response triggered by tumor necrosis factor , one of the crucial inflammation mediators  <cit> . as a model for brain inflammation, we initially investigated the transcriptional profile of tnf-treated astroglioma cells  <cit> . we demonstrated more than  <dig> tnf-regulated genes. macrophage chemoattractant protein  <dig>  was strongly up-regulated and secreted into the medium.

it is well established that neural stem cells express various chemokine receptors as a result of brain pathology . in addition to mcp- <dig>  expression of stromal derived factor  <dig> , stem cell factor  and vascular endothelial growth factor  has been reported. in subsequent experiments, we therefore tested the possibility that mcp- <dig> induces nsc migration  <cit>  and found a significant effect.

in view of the very well-described tnf secretion during inflammatory diseases and the very potent induction of nsc migration by mcp- <dig>  we hypothesized that in pathological situations these cells migrate from the svz to the area of the lesion. this hypothesis accords with a model proposed by muller et al.  <cit> . according to this model, neural stem cells are attracted by inflammation, reactive astrocytosis and angiogenesis. thus, nscs are exposed after migration to tnf at the area of inflammation.

in the present study, we analyzed the biological effect and signal transduction pathway of tnf in nscs in vitro. the advantage of the in vitro approach is a biochemically defined environment with minimal risk of unwanted cross-activation by cytokines and/or unknown in vivo cell-cell interactions.

within the nervous system, tnf  binds to tnf receptors  expressed on both glia and neurons  <cit> . expression of the tnf-α gene is subject to auto-regulation via activated nf-κb  <cit> . two different receptors have been identified: p <dig>  and p <dig> . the p <dig> receptor plays the major role in nf-κb activation  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that the ikk-α/β-complex is crucial for tnf-mediated nf-κb activation  <cit> , and there is evidence that tgfβ activated kinase- <dig>  is involved in the tnf-induced signaling cascade  <cit> .

cyclin dependent kinase  <dig> and  <dig>  signaling is crucial in neural stem cell cycle regulation  <cit> . moreover, formation of a complex between cdk  <dig> and cyclin d <dig> is necessary for nsc cell cycle progression by promoting passage through the g1/s restriction point. in contrast, burgess et al. showed clearly that cdk4/cyclin d <dig> in tumor cells is critical for g2/m progression and the fidelity of mitosis  <cit> . kaltschmidt et al. described cyclin d1-dependent proliferation of hela cells, which was abrogated by over-expression of iκb  <cit> . guttridge et al. were the first to show that nf-κb controls proliferation through transcriptional regulation of cyclin d <dig> in embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> .

in this study, we describe for the first time the tnf-mediated signal cascade in adult neural stem cells. tnf treatment leads to strong ikk-mediated nf-κb activation and up-regulation of cyclin d <dig> expression, resulting in increased proliferation. taken together, these results show that nf-κb has a crucial role in the proliferation of nscs induced by inflammation.

RESULTS
characterization of neural stem cells derived from the adult subventricular zone
the generation of neural stem/progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone was studied using specific stem-cell markers such as nestin, sox <dig>  doublecortin and musashi . most of the nscs were nestin-immunoreactive, a characteristic of neural stem cells, and they expressed the neural stem cell-specific transcription factor sox <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, they expressed doublecortin , a marker for newborn immature neurons that is also detected in proliferating neural cells  <cit> , and the rna-binding protein musashi, which is essential for neurosphere formation and proliferation  <cit> . the population markers l <dig> and lex, and the oligodendrocytic lineage marker a2b <dig>  were not expressed. moreover, we detected moderate expression of psa-ncam, a marker for migrating neuronal precursor cells. the differentiation markers β-iii-tubulin  and gfap  were not expressed . in order to analyze the effect of tnf on the nscs, we investigated the expression of the specific tnf receptors i and ii. immunocytochemical staining showed that both tnf-ri and ii are expressed on the cell surfaces . the intracellular localization of the tnf receptors  is consistent with the recent finding that tnf signalosomes are endosome-localized  <cit> . we also verified the expression of tnf-ri and ii by rt-pcr .

tnf induces an increase in neurosphere volume
we used sub-cultured secondary neurospheres from passage  <dig> onwards. nscs were treated for up to  <dig> days with tnf in different concentrations . this resulted in a significant, dose-dependent increase in volume of the 3d neurospheres . we then asked whether the increased neurosphere volume results from enhanced nsc proliferation.

growth of neurospheres correlates with proliferation of nscs
we analyzed stem cell proliferation by brdu incorporation. this technique has been extensively used to measure dna replication during proliferation of mammalian cells. incorporation of brdu was measured in control nsc cultures and in cultures treated with  <dig> ng/ml tnf for  <dig> h .

as expected, smaller spheres with lightly-labeled nuclei were seen in control cultures owing to endogenous proliferation. in contrast, tnf-treated neurospheres showed strong brdu incorporation, an indication of rapidly proliferating cells. this might explain the marked increase in neurosphere volume after  <dig> h of tnf treatment . thus, tnf significantly  activated nsc proliferation . brdu incorporation was more than 6-fold higher in tnf-treated cells than in untreated controls.

cell counting was also used as an independent measure of cell proliferation. tnf treatment significantly increased the cell number . this effect disappeared when the cells were pre-incubated with iκb ubiquitin ligase activity inhibitor pdtc. this is a first hint that nf-κb is involved in tnf-mediated signaling  in adult nscs.

tnf activates apoptosis only moderately in neural stem cells
since one of the known physiological effects of tnf is the induction of apoptosis, we analyzed the frequency of apoptotic cells in tnf-treated nscs. cells were treated with tnf for  <dig> days and analyzed for dna fragmentation using a tunel assay . dnase treatment as a positive control resulted in nearly 75% tunel-positive nuclei. label solution as a negative control gave no positive signal. in contrast, some apoptotic nuclei were detected under control conditions. tnf treatment increased the rate of apoptosis in nscs only moderately . this result suggests that a major aspect of the physiological action of tnf on nscs might be the induction of proliferation.

tnf does not interfere with neural stem cell differentiation
the crucial property of stem cells is to differentiate into more specialized cells, in our case into neuronal progenitors, immature neurons or glial cells. we therefore investigated whether tnf might influence the capacity of nscs to differentiate into neurons. tnf-treated and untreated cells were plated on laminin/poly-d-lysine coated culture dishes for up to  <dig> days. this protocol is frequently used to induce neuronal differentiation of nscs. cells positive for β-iii tubulin  with neuron-like morphology were detected  <dig> days after plating both with and without tnf treatment . the frequency with which immature neurons differentiated from the nscs was not significantly affected  by tnf treatment . in addition, tnf treatment had no effect on the capacity of the cells to differentiate into the glial lineage, as demonstated by immunocytochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein  four days after plating in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum  . this suggests that the action of tnf might be specific only for the proliferation of nscs; cell fate is not affected.

tnf activates nf-κb in neural stem cells
one of the major signal transduction pathways activated by tnf is the canonical nf-κb pathway. to investigate tnf-mediated signal transduction, a highly efficient transfection system was needed. we used a modified amaxa electroporation protocol , which transfected up to 60–80% of the cells, as shown by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry . to evaluate the efficacy of transfection, we used a commercially available expression vector for green fluorescent protein .

in view of the well-described activation of nf-κb by tnf in other systems such as various tumor cell lines, we transfected nscs with κb-luc reporter vector and renilla-luc control vector  using the method described above. expression of the nf-κb luciferase reporter plasmid was measured using bioluminescence . basal nf-κb activity in mock-transfected control cultures was set to a relative standard value . co-transfection of the nf-κb reporter plasmid and the nf-κb super-repressor iκb-aa <dig> significantly decreased the activity measured. in contrast, tnf treatment increased nf-κb activity more than 10-fold compared to untreated controls.

next, we analyzed the sub-cellular distribution of nf-κb p <dig>  untransfected nscs were fixed and immunostained with a p65-antibody . this activation-specific antibody can only react with the nuclear localization signal  of p <dig> when the repressing iκb protein is not present  <cit> . tnf treated nscs showed increased nuclear localization of p <dig>  compared to untreated controls . thus, the subcellular localization of nf-κb correlates with the activation.

tnf treatment elevates expression of cyclin d <dig> in nscs
several reports have shown that the cyclin d family has a crucial role in cell cycle progression, so we hypothesized that cyclin d might also be a bona fide target gene of nf-κb in nscs. we analyzed the expression of cyclins d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> in unsynchronized cells and detected strong expression of cyclin d <dig> in some cells . we then synchronized a nsc culture by cold shock . the synchronized cells were brought back to 37°c for  <dig> h  and stimulated with tnf. this treatment strongly activated the expression of cyclin d <dig> . as expected, cyclin d <dig> was mainly restricted to the nsc nuclei after tnf treatment . cyclin d1-positive cells increased more than 4-fold  compared to untreated, synchronized cells. interestingly, tnf treatment did not change the expression of cyclins d <dig> and d <dig> .

nf-κb regulates neural stem cell proliferation
next, a functional assay for the role of nf-κb in nsc proliferation was established using transfection with the transdominant negative super-repressor iκb-aa <dig>  mock-transfected, unstimulated cells showed basal nf-κb activity, which was decreased by the expression of iκb-aa <dig>  and resulted in a significantly lower cell number . when cells were stimulated with tnf for  <dig> days, proliferation was significantly  reduced when the super-repressor iκb-aa <dig> was transfected . tnf treatment caused increased proliferation of control nscs, while the division of iκb-aa <dig> transfected cells was not significantly affected . taken together, these data suggest that nf-κb activation might be responsible for nsc proliferation without the need for additional exogenous tnf . these data further demonstrate that blockade of the nf-κb pathway via transcriptional repression leads to decreased proliferation of nscs.

tak- <dig> and ikk-β gene knock down decreases endogenous and tnf-induced proliferation of nscs
in view of the well-established role of ikks in tnf-mediated signaling, we designed a specific sirna for ikk-β. some reports have suggested a potential role for tgfβ-activated kinase- <dig>  in the signal cascade under investigation, suggesting that construction of a sirna for this kinase could be informative . gene knock down of both tak- <dig> and ikk-β led to significantly decreased proliferation in comparison to cells transfected with control  sirna. interestingly, we observed that ikk-β knock down affected proliferation more markedly than the silencing of tak- <dig> . this general tendency was independent of tnf treatment.

tak- <dig> and ikk-β knock down decrease nf-κb activity
we studied the effect of the sirnas against tak- <dig> and ikk-β on nf-κb activity?. the cells were transiently co-transfected with sirna for tak- <dig> and κb-luc, or with sirna for ikk-β and κb-luc. endogenous nf-κb activity was markedly decreased after ikk-β knock down. in contrast, the effect of tak- <dig> on nf-κb activity was much weaker . tnf treatment led to activation of nf-κb in sirna-transfected and un-transfected cells. nevertheless, ikk-β sirna-transfected cells showed markedly decreased nf-κb activity compared to both untransfected and tak- <dig> sirna transfected cells. thus, nf-κb activity correlated with the effect on proliferation after knock down of tak- <dig> and ikk-β .

ikk-β but not tak- <dig> knock down leads to significantly decreased cyclin d <dig> expression
on the basis of our finding that cyclin d <dig> was up-regulated after tnf treatment, we investigated the influence of tak- <dig> and ikk-β knock down on cyclin d <dig> expression in nscs. silencing of ikk-β resulted in strongly decreased cyclin d <dig> expression, while tak- <dig> knock down induced only a moderate decrease .

ikk-β silencing but not tak- <dig> knock down induces apoptosis in nscs
finally, we investigated the potential induction of apoptosis by the sirnas. nsc apoptosis was enhanced by ikk-β knock down . tnf treatment had no significant effect on the cleavage of caspase- <dig> and therefore on the induction of apoptosis in control or tak- <dig> sirna-transfected cells . in contrast, ikk-β sirna-transfected cells showed a strongly increased apoptosis rate after tnf treatment . because tnf activated apoptosis only moderately in control cells, the up-regulation of caspase- <dig> cleavage might be explained by a higher apoptosis rate in cells transfected with anti-ikk-β sirna.

thus, tak- <dig> knock down once again had a weaker biological effect than ikk-β silencing. overall, ikk-β silencing strongly reduced nf-κb activity and cyclin d <dig> expression. in addition, proliferation stopped and apoptosis was induced, demonstrating that nf-κb has a dual role in nscs: survival and proliferation.

discussion
in this study, we have described a novel mitogenic action of tnf on adult neural stem cells. we investigated the signaling mechanism involved and showed that proliferation is crucially dependent on the activation of nf-κb. moreover, we showed for the first time that an active ikkα/β complex and active downstream iκb ubiquitin ligase are essential for nf-κb activation and the resulting proliferation of nscs, as indicated by the pharmacological blockade of iκb ubiquitin ligase and gene silencing of ikk-β via sirna. in addition, we showed that tnf treatment induces up-regulation of cyclin d <dig> expression, and we demonstrated an involvement, but not a crucial role, of tak- <dig> in the signal transduction cascade investigated.

in accordance with our data, tnf was recently identified as a mitogen in the subventricular zone of rats. stereotactical injection of tnf-α into the lateral ventricle resulted in a highly significant increase in proliferating cells  <dig> h post-injection  <cit> . here we have shown that tnf has a novel cell-autonomous action on isolated neural stem cells. this might rule out the potential effects of the endogenous stem cell niche. several reports have shown a marked up-regulation of tnf expression under pathological conditions such as infection with gram negative bacteria, alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and even brain inflammation  <cit> . on the other hand, cacci et al. reported that tnf is toxic to neural precursor cells when proliferation has ceased  <cit> . in contrast, few apoptotic cells were found in the svz of tnf-treated animals  <cit> .

there is much evidence for up-regulation of chemokine expression and secretion in situations of brain pathology  <cit> . interestingly, most such situations are characterized by tnf secretion into adjacent tissues. in a previous study we showed marked up-regulation of mcp- <dig> expression and secretion by astroglioma cells after tnf treatment  <cit> . subsequently, we identified mcp- <dig> as a potent chemoattractant for nscs  <cit> . it is to be expected that in pathological situations nscs will migrate from their endogenous niche  in response to chemokines such as mcp- <dig>  released at the area of inflammation  <cit> . thus, after migration, nscs are exposed to tnf. in this context, our results suggest that a major aspect of the physiological action of tnf on nscs might be the induction of proliferation.

taken together, these data suggest that after cns injury, tnf-α not only plays a critical role in the development of pathology and inflammation, but could also activate nsc proliferation, which might be a physiological means of repair and neuroprotection. in accordance with this hypothesis, pluchino et al. showed that during cns inflammation, nscs are able to promote neuroprotection  <cit> . this phenomenon might be explained by secretion of neuroprotective cytokines by nscs.

we used human tnf-α, which has been shown to activate tnf-ri but not tnf-rii in rat neuronal cultures  <cit> . the cultures used in the present study express both tnf-ri and tnf-rii. human tnf-α has been identified as neuroprotective in hippocampal neurons  <cit>  and cerebellar granule cell precursors  <cit> . genetic ablation of tnf-ri  exacerbates traumatic brain injury and is correlated with reduced nf-κb activation  <cit> . in contrast, tnf-α was cytotoxic to mouse-derived neurospheres and interfered with their formation  <cit> . these data, which conflict with those obtained with rat nscs, might be attributed either to species differences or the use of murine tnf, which binds to both tnf receptors. the tnf-ri receptor is thought to be the major nf-κb activating tnfr  <cit> .

in a recent study, mehrhof et al. convincingly showed genetic evidence for a cell type-restricted requirement for nf-κb in the control of proliferation  <cit> . thus, the role of nf-κb in proliferation has to be investigated separately for each cell type. in this study, inhibition of nf-κb resulted in a pronounced reduction of nsc proliferation. in the endogenous niche of nscs – the subventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream – members of the nf-κb family are expressed in dividing cells  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that the ikk-α/β-complex is crucial for tnf-mediated nf-κb activation in other systems  <cit> . here we have shown for the first time that ikks are crucial for nf-κb activation and nsc proliferation.

there is evidence for the involvement of tgfβ activated kinase- <dig>  in the tnf-induced signaling cascade  <cit> . here we have shown that tak- <dig> is involved in tnf signaling in nscs but is not crucial for nf-κb activation and the resulting proliferation.

ferguson et al. showed that cyclin dependent kinase  <dig> and  <dig>  signaling is crucial for neural precursor cell cycle regulation  <cit> . it is well-established that formation of a complex between cdks  <dig> and  <dig> and cyclin d <dig> is necessary for cell cycle progression. interestingly, guttridge et al. demonstrated that nf-κb controls growth and differentiation through transcriptional regulation of cyclin d <dig>  <cit> . here we report for the first time the tnf-mediated up-regulation of cyclin d <dig> in nscs. cyclin d <dig> is the bona-fide nf-κb target gene, with mapped and functionally characterized nf-κb binding sites in its promoter  <cit> .

the expression of nf-κb subunits and the induction of proliferation might suggest that both pathways are linked in vivo. we have shown for the first time that nf-κb activation is essential for neural stem cell proliferation. one might ask if tnf-α can also act as a mitogen in other systems. in fact, tnf-α is a growth factor for hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous t-cell lymphoma and gliomas . recent data suggest that nf-κb is constitutively activated in most cell lines derived from hematopoietic or solid tumors  <cit> . similarly, we and others have shown that nf-κb inhibition results in reduced tumor cell proliferation  <cit> .

indeed, the requirement for activated nf-κb is not the only similarity between dividing tumor cells and stem cells. recent evidence suggests that formation of tumors might be restricted to cells with stem cell markers  <cit> . our data might be especially relevant to brain tumors such as glioblastomas that contain cancer stem cells  <cit> . only a few cells are endowed with the ability to replicate and thus to transfer the tumor phenotype residing within medulloblastomas and astrocytomas. these cancer stem cells derived from brain tumors formed nscs and were positive for the neural stem cells markers nestin and cd <dig>  <cit> .

understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell proliferation might be crucial for future regenerative and anti-tumor medicine.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides experimental evidence that nf-κb is a crucial regulator of nsc proliferation. in addition to providing novel insights in the mechanisms governing adult stem cell self-renewal, this study might add a cautionary note about the use of anti-cell-proliferative agents in tumor therapy.
