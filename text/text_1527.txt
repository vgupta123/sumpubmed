BACKGROUND
genetic mapping has been the foundation of molecular analysis in plants and animals for nearly a century, since the publication of the first map by sturtevant in  <dig>  <cit> . this widely successful approach relies on recombination to separate and order marker loci. in many plant species, including wheat , recombination events are not evenly distributed along the length of the chromosomes  <cit> . recombination hot-spots, sites with high recombination rates, are interspersed with recombination cold-spots. in addition, in species with large genomes, such as wheat, barley, or maize, recombination frequency tends to decrease with increased proximity to the centromere  <cit> , being close to zero at the centromere and its surroundings. it is estimated that about one-fourth to one-third of the ~ <dig> gb wheat genome  <cit>  accounts for less than 1% of the total recombination  <cit> . initial studies hypothesized that these recombination poor regions were nothing more than “junk” dna  <cit> , only to discover that over 30% of wheat genes exist within this space  <cit> . limited recombination makes these genes virtually inaccessible to genetic mapping. similarly, the use of genetic maps as scaffolds to orient physical maps  provides only limited information for these recombination poor regions.

radiation hybrid  mapping is a method that was originally proposed as an alternative to the use of recombination for mapping marker loci  <cit> . in rh mapping, high dosages of radiation are used to generate random double strand breaks  across the genome. the dsbs are then recognized and fixed by one of two main repair mechanisms: homology-directed repair  or non-homologus end-joining , also known as illegitimate recombination  <cit> . both of these mechanisms are highly conserved in eukaryotes. nhej, an error prone mechanism, is considered the prevailing choice of somatic dsb repair in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . in the last two decades, a number of proteins involved in the nhej repair mechanism have been identified  <cit> . also, a model has been proposed to explain their interaction and functionality. in brief, presence of dna broken ends is sensed through the atm  signaling pathway. the ku protein complex is then recruited to the damaged site with the function of protecting the dsbs from further degradation. the ku complex becomes anchored at the break site and is then used as a docking point by dna phosphokinases, which directly or indirectly create protein bridges to pull the two broken ends together, and finally re-join them by a dna ligase  <cit> . when the broken ends are re-joined, the nucleotides located within the adjacent dsbs are lost. the loss mainly involves a small number of nucleotides, but deletions of larger size are not uncommon  <cit> .

radiation hybrid mapping exploits the formation of dna deletions to generate a binary polymorphism  which is then used to identify the correct marker order by their simultaneous co-deletion or co-retention  <cit> . while the molecular components of the nhej mechanism of repair have been partially or entirely identified, its precise activity in live organisms requires further investigations. in this regard, viable rh plant populations might represent a novel and useful tool.

during the last two decades, rh mapping has played an important role in mapping and genome assembly of a number of organisms, including humans and other animals  <cit> . however, only a few preliminary studies have been reported in crop plants, such as maize   <cit> , barley   <cit> , cotton   <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . in an effort to sequence the bread wheat chromosome 3b, a partial physical map covering 82% of the estimated 993 mb size of the chromosome was recently published  <cit> . in that study, rh mapping was tested as a mean to provide good quality scaffolding for physical mapping. here, we present an extension of that work, with the development of a high density rh map of chromosome 3b to align bacterial artificial chromosome  contigs. this is an unprecedented opportunity in plants to examine the physical distribution of radiation mediated deletions at a very refined level. furthermore, this map was employed to assess what are commonly considered the three major advantages of rh mapping: i) high map resolution, ii) precise conversion of centi rays  distances to physical distances, and iii) independence from the patterns observed for meiotic recombination events. surprisingly, the data presented here support only the first two hypotheses, while a strong correlation was identified between the action of the dna breakage/repair mechanism and the frequency of meiotic recombination events. this result suggests that the state of chromatin may influence the dna break formation and repair mechanism in a similar way as it influences recombination events.

RESULTS
a dense and precise 3b-rh map
in plants, in vivo rh panels can be generated by simple gamma irradiation of seeds, followed by artificial cross-pollination of adult mutant lines. a rh panel for chromosome 3b was generated by gamma irradiating seeds of a normal durum line containing chromosome 3b  at  <dig> gray  and crossing it to an aneuploid line that lacks this chromosome . a total of  <dig> rh <dig> lines were developed, and  <dig> rh <dig> lines were selected on the basis of genotyping data from  <dig> insertion site based polymorphism  marker loci  <cit> . the selected sub-population is composed of  <dig> lines with deletions of various sizes , nine lacked the entire chromosome , and  <dig> retained the whole chromosome  . the average retention frequency of this selected population was  <dig> . based on past experience, this small sample is a good representation of any larger rh population  <cit> . locations of radiation-induced breaks on chromosome 3b were determined employing  <dig> markers, which include  <dig> isbp,  <dig> simple sequence repeats  and  <dig> diversity array technology  markers. for  <dig> of these markers , the chromosomal location  <cit>  and the bacterial artificial chromosome  contig of appurtenance were known . these markers were defined as ‘anchor markers’. the marker information was used to construct an iterative framework map of lod  <dig> using a modified version of the carthagene software package  <cit> ; for details on the mapping algorithm see additional file  <dig>  the final map  spans  <dig>  cr, as defined by  <dig> unique loci . assuming even distribution of markers along the chromosome, the overall marker density is one marker every  <dig>  cr, or approximately  <dig>  mb based on the 993 mb size of chromosome 3b  <cit> . quality of the rh map was tested by comparison with two previously published genetic maps  <cit> . this examination revealed better conservation of marker loci order between the 3b-rh iterative map and paux et al.  <cit>  map than between the two genetic maps . further confirmation of the strength of this approach was provided by the marker wpt- <dig> mapped on the 3b-rh map at position  <dig>  cr, in between anchor markers cfp <dig> and cfp <dig>  which are at positions  <dig>  cr and  <dig>  cr, respectively. marker wpt- <dig> was mapped into contig  <dig>  which has been entirely sequenced  <cit> . the two anchor markers cfp <dig> and cfp <dig> are located at  <dig> ,689 bp and  <dig> ,531 bp on this contig, respectively. the sequence of wpt- <dig> was used to map this locus in silico at position  <dig> ,833 bp , just outside the interval predicted in 3b-rh. assuming 100% to be the error of placing a locus an entire chromosome length away  from its correct physical position, error for the 3b-rh map was calculated  to be as low as  <dig> %. this is a relatively small error considering that only  <dig> lines were used for the analysis.

rh map resolution
map resolution is defined as the minimum physical distance between two marker loci needed to map them separately. it is calculated as the ratio between physical and map distances . smaller values indicate better resolution. radiation hybrid maps are expected to provide higher map resolutions than genetic maps, and also a better estimate of the actual physical distance between mapped loci  <cit> . to verify these two hypotheses, the resolution was estimated at three physical levels: i) the whole chromosome , ii) chromosome sub-portions, defined as cytogenetic deletion bins , and iii) within bac contigs . cytogenetic deletion bins  are physical segments of wheat chromosomes identified by cytogenetic lines carrying a terminal deletion of a specific chromosome fragment  <cit> . the physical sizes of these bins have been estimated through a combination of molecular and cytogenetic studies. these bins are commonly identified by the chromosome number , the chromosome arm , and the percentage of the specific arm that is identified ; for simplicity, we report the bin full name in table  <dig>  and we only use an abbreviated identifier in the text. bac contigs were generated by fingerprinting large libraries of clones, and their physical size is an estimate . the resolution was calculated for both maps, genetic and rh, for the first two levels, but bac contig analysis was reserved only for 3b-rh.

† whole chromosome values are not averages for each category but re-calculated for the overall values. ‡ values in the row are as of saintenac et al.  <cit> . § frequency of dna breakage and repair per mb and frequency of a crossing-over event per mb. ¶ resolution is the potential to uniquely resolve two markers at a distance equal or larger than this value. chr: chromosome; br freq: breakage and repair frequency; co freq: crossing over frequency; cr: centirays; mb: megabase.

the first nine contigs could be oriented, the remaining eight could not be oriented.

† average.

in 3b-rh map, the bin locations were known for  <dig> anchor markers, and this information was used to extrapolate the locations of the non-anchored markers. the largest portion of 3b-rh map is contained within two bins  accounting for 55% of the total map size, but only for 25% of the physical size of chromosome 3b . assuming complete coverage of the chromosome, and considering the 3b physical size of 993 mb  <cit> , the 3b-rh map resolution averaged  <dig>  mb cr- <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> for bin 3bs <dig> and 3bs <dig> to  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> for 3bl <dig> . the two centromeric bins exhibited very similar resolutions,  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> and  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> in c-3bs <dig> and c-3bl <dig>  respectively . chromosome-wise, the rh map resolution deviated less than five-fold from the calculated average. in comparison, the resolution calculated by saintenac et al.  <cit>  for their genetic map of chromosome 3b was  <dig>  mb cm- <dig>   <dig>  fold lower than the resolution of the 3b-rh map, and deviated along the chromosome up to  <dig> fold  from the average .

the resolution of the 3b-rh map reached its minimum in bin 3bl <dig> at  <dig>  mb cr- <dig>  based on this value, the small population of  <dig> rh <dig> lines used should have the mapping potential to uniquely order any bac contig with size > <dig>  mb. to test this hypothesis, markers anchored to  <dig> bac contigs ,  <dig> from the short arm and  <dig> from the long arm, mainly belonging to the bin 3bl <dig> , were analyzed. a contig can be assigned to a specific chromosomal position with the help of a single marker; however, two or more mapped markers are required to orient a contig. for  <dig> of  <dig> contigs two or more markers were available, and nine of these could be uniquely oriented . the physical distance between the markers used to orient the contigs ranged from  <dig>  mb for contig  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb  for contig  <dig>  as expected, the eight contigs that could not be oriented contained markers spaced by distances < <dig>  mb, ranging from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. map resolution within contigs were also calculated, ranging from  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> for contig  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> for contig  <dig>  and averaging  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> for the whole chromosome.

sizes of gamma ray induced chromosome deletions in the 3b-rh panel
a single radiation-induced deletion was defined by a set of flanking markers detecting an uninterrupted deletion smaller than a whole chromosome arm. eight of the  <dig> lines had continuous deletions larger than a chromosome arm, retaining only a small portion of chromosome 3b, probably through translocation to a different chromosome. one line apparently lost the entire chromosome. the loss of an entire chromosome can be due to large rearrangements or improper chromosome sorting at meiosis, possibly caused by excessive deletions or removal of critical segments, such as the centromere. thirteen putative rh lines did not show any deletions . these  <dig> lines were not considered when calculating the deletion size. in the absence of a fully sequenced genome, the deletion size was measured in map units  and then converted into mb, based on the conversion ratio calculated for each bin .

the largest deletion identified spans  <dig>  cr, representing the loss of the entire bin c-3bs <dig> equal to 144 mb, while the smallest deletion stretches  <dig>  cr of bin 3bs <dig>  accounting for  <dig>  mb in size. deletions of smaller size are also possible  <cit>  but their identification would require a more targeted approach than the one employed here. the average deletion size across chromosome 3b was  <dig>  mb, ranging from  <dig>  mb of bin 3bs <dig> to  <dig>  mb of bin c-3bl <dig> . on average, each of the  <dig> informative lines carried  <dig>  deletions, ranging from one to thirteen . there is an inverse correlation  between the number of deletions and their relative size, with the centromeric regions typically having fewer but larger deletions and the telomeric regions having smaller and more frequent deletions.

also, the distribution of deletion frequency  across the rh-3b population was investigated in an attempt to identify any chromosomal region which is preferentially deleted or retained . the average deletion frequency was 13%, reaching a maximum of 15% in c-3bs <dig> and a minimum of 12% in 3bl <dig>  overall the deletion frequency was evenly distributed and no significant difference was observed among the bins. apparently, the vicinity to chromosomal landmarks such as the centromere or telomeres does not influence the frequency at which a given locus is lost, but rather the size or number of deletions that are created.

distribution of dna break/repair events show correlation to the frequency of crossing-over
the cr unit measures the frequency of co-retention of two marker loci  between two adjacent loci observed in every  <dig> lines screened). similarly, one cm indicates one recombination event between two loci in  <dig> lines. deletion of one locus is likely the result of two dsbs, one distal and one proximal to the lost marker locus. therefore, the number of deletions between two markers in  <dig> lines can be obtained by dividing the cr distance separating them by two. a dna deletion in rh is the consequence of a radiation-mediated breakage, which is then repaired by the dna-damage repair mechanism. hence, when dividing half of the cr distance between two markers by the physical size that separates them, we are measuring the frequency at which radiation-mediated dsbs are formed and then repaired, most likely through nhej. this frequency  frequency; table 2) was calculated and expressed as the number of breakage/repair events  per mb. for instance, a br frequency of  <dig> cr/2 mb- <dig> would indicate that in a specific interval two breakage/repair events occurred on average every 1 mb, while a value of  <dig> cr/2 mb- <dig> would suggest  <dig> br events every mb. similarly, by dividing cm by the physical size of the interval, we are measuring the average physical distance that separated crossing-over .

crossing-over frequencies in wheat are known to be unevenly distributed across the chromosome, and generally decrease with proximity to the centromere  <cit> . the relative distance from the centromere does not entirely explain the distribution of co events, still we confirmed a positive correlation  between the frequency of co and the relative distance from the centromere. the same analysis did not return a significant interaction between the br frequency and the distance from centromere , further confirming that the proximity to chromosomal landmarks by itself does not influence the frequency of dna breakage and repair. however, bin 3bs <dig> exhibited the highest br frequency  and co frequency . bin 3bl <dig> exhibited one of the lowest co frequency , and also the lowest br frequency . the similarity between these values prompted us to compute chromosome-wide correlation between the br frequencies and the co frequencies . a correlation coefficient r =  <dig>   was obtained when considering the ten bins for which information on both frequencies was available. bin 3bs <dig> was excluded from the analysis due to lack of co frequency data. this significant correlation indicates that the co and br frequencies are not independent values . furthermore, the total number and average size of radiation-mediated deletions in each deletion bin was calculated, confirming that both co and br frequencies are positively correlated  with the number of deletions, but only weakly inversely correlated with the average deletion size  . no significant correlation was observed between co, br frequencies and markers deletion frequencies. to avoid confusion, we would like to emphasize that br frequency and deletion frequency do not measure the same biological effect. the br frequency value estimates the activity of the dna repair mechanism, while the deletion frequency measures just the number of times that a given locus or a region is damaged by radiation.

discussion
in this study, a population of  <dig> rh <dig> lines was analyzed using a novel iterative framework mapping algorithm  to generate a dense rh map of wheat chromosome 3b. the map quality tests indicated a small map error . hence, it was concluded that the method employed for mapping did not generate any perceivable bias, and downstream analyses should not be skewed by the anchor marker mapping approach.

is rh mapping resolution higher and more uniform than the resolution of genetic mapping? to answer this question, the 3b-rh map was compared to the high quality genetic map of chromosome 3b published by saintenac et al.  <cit> . the 3b-rh panel provided on average a  <dig>  fold higher overall resolution than the genetic map, reaching a maximum of 136-fold better resolution at the centromere, where recombination is most scarce. we believe that this is sufficient evidence to conclude that rh mapping indeed provides higher resolution than genetic mapping. the average resolution is often calculated for genetic maps, but the uneven distribution of recombination along a chromosome can result in up to 30-fold variation between telomeric and centromeric regions . for this reason, the resolution value calculated for genetic maps is not a reliable measure of the actual physical distance separating the mapped loci. to investigate if rh maps would provide a more uniform resolution across the chromosome, the average resolution for the entire chromosome was compared with the resolution for each chromosomal region. the average resolution, calculated as the total physical size of the chromosome divided by the total map length, was  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> and a maximum of five-fold deviation from this value  along the chromosome was observed. thus rh mapping resolution is six times more uniform than genetic mapping resolution. the resolution within bac contigs for this map was also assessed. in this case, resolution fluctuated more dramatically, ranging from  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> to  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> a 53-fold increase from the chromosome-wide average, and averaged at  <dig>  mb cr- <dig> . this large fluctuation is probably the result of the non-random selection of rh lines identified at the beginning of the study. in fact, the subset of  <dig> lines was specifically selected for their quality of map-resolving  <dig> markers of the  <dig> employed to measure the bac contig resolution. it is then not surprising that they provide a much higher resolution exactly for those markers that were used in the initial selection.

overall, the lowest resolution observed for any chromosome region in this study was  <dig>  mb cr- <dig>  this indicates the ability of our small rh population to unequivocally orient any bac contig of size larger than  <dig>  mb. only eight bac contigs could not be uniquely oriented in this study, the largest of which was only  <dig>  mb in size. such high resolution has been observed in many human and animal radiation hybrid maps before  <cit> , but among plant studies reported to date only a resolution of ~ <dig>  mb calculated on the number of obligate breaks for chromosome 1d of wheat  <cit>  is close to the high resolution presented here.

the chromatin state affects the dna break/repair mechanism
rh studies rely on the random formation of deletions for mapping. given the theoretical absence of molecular bias, the rh mapping approach has been thought to provide a true physical representation of chromosomes  <cit> . in contrast, genetic maps are not precise physical representation of the genome because they rely on recombination events that may not be evenly distributed  <cit> . the biased distribution of crossing-over events is associated with the specific requirements of the recombination machinery. in yeast and mouse, meiotic dsbs that initiate recombination are predominantly formed in open chromatin sites marked by trimethylation of lysine at position  <dig> in the h <dig> histone  <cit> . little is known about patterns of meiotic dsb formation in plants  <cit> , but they are likely similar to those in yeast and mammals, i.e. fewer dsbs are formed in the more densely packed chromatin regions  <cit> . open chromatin regions should be more common in the distal regions of wheat chromosomes  <cit> .

the data presented here confirms that the frequency of co events are partially dependent on the relative distance from the centromere  but fails to identify a similar correlation for br frequency. this lack of correlation supports the hypothesis that rh maps are indeed true physical representations of chromosomes, and that the formation of deletions are random events independent of chromosome landmarks. however, it must be kept in mind that co happens at meiosis, when chromosome are highly compacted, while br occurs in somatic cells mostly during mitotic interphase, when chromosome landmarks are hard to observe. on the other hand, data presented here show dependent distribution between co and br events, suggesting a similar preference for specific chromosomal regions for both mechanisms. in literature, three plant studies have reported strong correlations between meiotic co frequencies and somatic dna break and repair processes. liu et al.  <cit>  showed that distribution of insertions of the mu transposon in maize correlates with the distribution of recombination events across the genome. similarly, choulet et al.  <cit>  identified correlation between transposable element  distribution and disruption of gene order conservation, which is accelerated by cos. the third study demonstrated a correlation between te distribution and modification of gene order, as well as a correlation between non-syntenic gene order and the co frequency  <cit> . a common causative factor that explains the observed correlations is the dependence of all three processes, te insertion, gene order disruption and co formation, on formation of dsbs. based on these reports and data presented here, one can postulate that the correlation between co frequency and br frequency can also be explained by the dependence on dsbs formation in both processes, and their consequent dependence on the chromatin state.

a working hypothesis: how does the chromatin state affects the dna-damage/repair mechanism?
assuming that the breakage/repair mechanism has a preference for open chromatin regions, it is intriguing to hypothesize on how these regions specifically influence this process. there are two levels at which the state of chromatin could influence formation of chromosomal deletions: i) regions of compact chromatin could be more resistant to radiation damage; and/or ii) the repair mechanism requires open chromatin regions to perform its activity. if the first hypothesis is correct, we should observe a reduction in the number of deletions in those regions that are particularly heterochromatic, such as the peri- and centromeric regions. the data presented in figure  <dig>  show no significant difference in the frequency at which deletions forms in the telomere or centromere of chromosome 3b. this would suggest that chromatin compactness by itself is not a sufficient shield to prevent dna damage. a similar conclusion was also reached for yeast  <cit>  and humans  <cit> , leaving our first hypothesis short of supporting evidences. on the other hand, it leaves open the possibility that the chromatin state directly influences the repair mechanism, possibly preventing the formation of non-radiation-mediated dsbs, necessary to complete the repair. goodarzi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that in human cells the repair complex is unable to adequately access or manipulate radiation-mediated breaks occurring in regions of compact chromatin. hence, if radiation-mediated breaks happen independently from the chromatin state, but less condensed chromatin is necessary for the dna repair mechanism to properly operate, logic dictates that in tightly compacted chromosomal regions larger and less frequent deletions are expected, while in more open regions the number of deletions would increase and their size diminishes. that is precisely what we observed for chromosome 3b . thus this data supports in vivo the hypothesis that “higher order chromatin architecture exerts just as profound an influence on dna repair as it does on nuclear processes such as transcription and replication”  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
radiation hybrid mapping is an effective approach to map all markers  in wheat and other organisms. high levels of mapping resolution can be achieved with relatively small populations. since its first application 37 years ago  <cit>  rh mapping was believed an approach totally independent from patterns of recombination. here, for the first time, data have been collected that suggest otherwise, indicating that rh mapping relies on higher order chromatin structure similar to recombination hot-spots observed in genetic mapping. however, the 3b-rh map generated still offered a resolution eleven fold higher than a comparable genetic map and a fairly consistent physical to cr conversion across the entire chromosome, making this approach the most dependable for the scaffold assembly of genome sequencing initiatives. moreover, in plants rh lines can be produced entirely in vivo, providing a unique tool to study the effect of radiation in living organisms. new insights have been gathered in the past few years on possible interactions between the state of chromatin and various dna break-repair processes, such as those involved in co event formation, dna repair, te insertion, and synteny disruption. we presented here a working hypothesis to explain how the chromatin state could affect the dna repair mechanism, together with the biological material to further investigate this hypothesis. specifically targeted cytogenetic studies employing rh lines are likely to provide the evidences necessary to shed light on the precise effect of chromatin on the dna break-repair mechanism.
