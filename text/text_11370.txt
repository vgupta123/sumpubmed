BACKGROUND
the pathogenesis of cancer in humans is still poorly understood. to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients, several large-scale cancer genomics projects   <cit> , and international cancer genome consortium   <cit> ) have been performed in recent years. analyzing these high-throughput data provides valuable opportunities to understand the formation and progression of cancer  <cit> .

generally, a large number of mutations occur in cancer genomes ). one crucial step in cancer research is to distinguish driver mutations and driver genes, which contribute to the progression of cancer from normal to malignant states, from passenger mutations and passenger genes, which accumulate in cells but do not contribute to cancer development  <cit> . most early efforts were devoted to the detection of individual driver genes based on recurrent mutations of the genes in a large cohort of cancer patients  <cit> .

because of the mutational heterogeneity of cancer genomes, more attention has been paid to identify driver pathways and modules rather than individual genes in recent years  <cit> . it is noteworthy that most such methods involve the use of prior knowledge about pathways and/or protein interaction networks. for example, known pathways were analyzed for enrichment of somatic mutations  <cit> , or were examined to find which ones are significantly disturbed across many patients  <cit> . on the other hand, several studies indicated that driver pathways often cover a large number of samples. more importantly, mutations of the genes in one pathway usually exhibit mutual exclusivity, i.e., a single mutation is usually enough to disturb one pathway  <cit> . these rules have been frequently used to detect driver pathways and modules . for example, ciriello et al. proposed memo  to detect oncogenic network modules within a constructed network using gene mutation information and a human reference network   <cit> .

however, it is believed that the human protein interaction network is incomplete. there are many unknown protein interactions and a great deal of knowledge about biological pathways remains unclear. many reverse engineering approaches were developed in recent years to infer complex biological regulatory relationships. for example, acharya et al. proposed the gene set gibbs sampling  method to reconstruct signaling pathway structures by sequentially inferring the information flows from the overlapping information flow gene sets  <cit> . it is necessary to develop new methods to discover mutated driver pathways or core modules without relying on prior information. recently, vandin et al. proposed an approach, called dendrix , to de novo discover mutated driver pathways using somatic mutation data  <cit> . in this method, a novel weight function was introduced by combining the coverage and exclusivity of the gene set. maximization of the weight function is defined as the maximum weight submatrix problem. this was originally solved by the markov chain monte carlo  method  <cit> , and was then addressed using an exact binary linear programming  model  <cit> . however, these studies for the identification of driver pathways or core modules have all focused on single pathways or modules  <cit> . how various cellular and physiological processes are coordinately altered during the initiation and progression of cancer, it is still a major challenge.

it is well known that multiple pathways with mutations are generally required for cancer  <cit> . in fact, it has been recently recognized that pathways often function cooperatively in carcinogenesis . based on mutation data from cosmic  <cit>  and six major cancer-associated pathways from previous studies, yeang et al. demonstrated that there were significant combinatorial patterns of mutations occurring in the same patients , for which the corresponding genes usually function in different pathways, whereas mutations in genes functioning in the same pathway are rarely mutated in the same sample   <cit> . cui et al. identified  <dig> oncogene-signaling blocks from the integrated human signaling network  <cit> . they found that some of them  would collaboratively promote cancer signaling and foster tumorigenesis. using  <dig> pathways enriched with mutations in lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> , gu et al. investigated pathway cooperation in cancer cells in terms of superpathways, which are clusters of co-disrupted pathways whose significance is tested by the hypergeometric model  <cit> . more recently, gu et al. devised a heuristic approach to detect cooperative functional modules in the glioblastoma multiforme  altered network which is obtained by mapping mutated genes onto a protein interaction network from the pathway commons database, and several pairs of significantly co-altered modules were identified which are involved in the main pathways known to be perturbed in gbm  <cit> .

all these studies indicate that carcinogenesis is a complex process and the malignant transformation from a normal cell to a tumor is indeed a highly cooperative procedure involving synergy between pathways. therefore, systematically exploring the complex collaboration among different biological pathways and functional modules is a crucial step, which will shed new lights on our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. current studies have mainly focused on the utilization of prior knowledge to determine whether two or more pathways or modules are simultaneously perturbed in the same samples. considering the incompleteness of the knowledge about pathways and protein interaction networks, de novo discovery of collaborative pathways playing driver roles in cancer initiation and development is of pressing need. although iteratively performing dendrix  <cit>  or blp  <cit>  can obtain multiple pathways by removing the gene sets found in each previous iteration, however, such pathways are not guaranteed to be significantly co-disrupted in the same patients.

in this study, a mathematical programming approach to discover co-occurring mutated driver pathways  in cancer generation and progression was developed. the co-occurring pathways detected here possess two properties: first, each pathway is a set of mutated genes with high coverage and high exclusivity; second, the mutations between pathway genes exhibit a statistically significant co-occurrence in cancer samples. comdp is an exact method where the optimal set of pathways is obtained using an efficient algorithm. it does not require any prior information besides mutation profiles. to evaluate this method, we first applied it onto simulated data and compared it with the original blp method. then we applied it onto four biological datasets and several pathways which might play collaborative roles in carcinogenesis were identified. for example, for the glioblastoma tumor data and lung adenocarcinoma data, several significant co-occurring gene pathways were detected. each pair interacts and regulates the cell survival and protein synthesis processes. in addition, a modified form  was proposed in situations in which a certain pathway has been previously proven to play important roles in some cancers and one wants to know whether there are other pathways with cooperative effects in tumorigenesis. furthermore, multiple co-occurring driver pathways can be discovered by combining previously detected pairs of gene sets and identifying others using mod_comdp. when applied to the ovarian carcinoma dataset, comdp and/or mod_comdp identified driver pathways related to tp <dig> in the generation and progression of ovarian cancer. in summary, we developed a method for identifying mutated co-occurring driver pathways which can enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis.

methods
brief introduction of the maximum weight submatrix problem
the dendrix method was designed to de novo discover a single mutated driver pathway from somatic mutation data, where a weight function w was introduced by combining the coverage and exclusivity of the gene set  <cit> . given a binary mutation matrix a with m rows  and n columns , the maximization of w was defined as the maximum weight submatrix problem  <cit> , which means to find a submatrix m of size m×k in the mutation matrix a by maximizing the weight function w:
  <dig>  

where Γ={i:aig=1} denotes the set of patients in which the gene g is mutated and Γ=∪g∈mΓ, |Γ| measures the coverage of m and  measures the coverage overlap of m.

in addition to the stochastic mcmc search procedure  <cit> , a blp model has been introduced to solve this problem exactly  <cit> . inspired by the blp model, a binary linear programming model comdp to discover co-occurring driver pathways was developed here . the focus was placed on finding possible cooperative driver pathways in carcinogenesis. for example, in figure  <dig>  the gene set d not c can be detected using mcmc or blp for k= <dig>  this is because gene set d has higher mutation score w than that of gene set c. mutations in the gene set b and the gene set c occurred simultaneously among a cohort of patients. comdp can successfully identify such co-occurring gene sets which may have been missed by previous approaches.figure  <dig> 
schematic illustration of driver gene sets  and their co-occurrence in the mutation matrix. three gene sets, b, c, and d, with high coverage and high exclusivity are shown. gene sets b and c occur simultaneously among the same patients.



comdp: a binary linear programming model for the identification of co-occurring driver pathways
for the mutation matrix a, let us consider two submatrices m and n . given the coverage Γ and Γ of the two gene sets , we define  the common coverage ;  the union coverage . we further define the non-shared coverage d=b−c, which describes the extent of the mutation co-occurrence between the two gene sets: the smaller the value d, the larger the co-occurrence is. as suggested before, ω and ω reflect the exclusivity of m and n respectively.

to identify co-occurring gene sets with large coverage and high exclusivity, we introduce the following weight function h:
  <dig>  

to maximize this weight function, a binary linear programming model is introduced as follows:
  <dig>    <dig>  

where uj and vj are indicators whether column j of a falls into the submatrx m or n, so all the columns j’s with uj= <dig> and vj= <dig> constitute m and n respectively; xi and yi are indicators whether the entries of row i of m and n are not all zeros, so  and  represent the coverage of m and n | and |Γ|) respectively; zi is the indicator whether both xi and yi equal to  <dig>  so  represents the overlap between the coverage of m and n ). k is the total number of genes within s and t; and finally, λ and η are two parameters controlling the common coverage c and the non-shared coverage d of the two gene sets.

note that  and  in model  are always nonnegative according to the constraints in . one can properly set λ and η to be positive or negative to obtain gene sets with specific characteristics. for example, if λ< <dig> and η> <dig>  the model tends to detect gene sets with large non-shared coverage but small common coverage under the maximization of g. certainly, λ> <dig> and η< <dig> must be set if one wants to identify co-occurring driver pathways by maximizing the function h in , which is the main focus of this study. more discussion on the behavior of the model with λ and η can be referred to simulation study below.

mod_comdp: finding a pathway that co-occurs with a known one
in some cases, some prior information is known for a disease. for example, a certain pathway may have been previously proven to play important roles in cancer. the problem is determining whether another pathway with a cooperative effect on tumorigenesis exists. codmp can be modified to answer this question to some extent. for a known pathway or a gene set c, a possible co-occurring pathway d can be identified by the following modified optimization problem:
  <dig>    <dig>  

where xi and uj are indicators whether the entries of row i in gene set c are not all zeros and whether the gene corresponding to column j of a falls into c, respectively; yi,zi,vj and the parameters λ and η have the same meaning as in  and ; r is the size of the desired gene set d.

generally, a branch-and-bound algorithm or others can be used to produce an optimal exact solution for comdp . in this study, an ibm ilog cplex optimizer was used to test the effectiveness of the model. the experiments were performed on a  <dig>  ghz core i5-2520m cpu pc. for each given k, comdp can automatically identify two gene sets when the sum of their sizes equals k. although the problem was np-hard, it can still be solved efficiently due to the sparsity of the mutation matrix.

statistical significance
a permutation test was used to assess the significance of the results. as in a previous study  <cit> , the weight w in  served as a statistic to test the significance of the exclusivity and coverage of each identified gene set . we employed the co-occurrence ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the common coverage to the union coverage, as the statistic to test the significance of the co-occurrence of these two gene sets .

simulation data
three datasets were constructed to illustrate the properties of the proposed method. the first set of simulated data, sim _data <dig>  was generated as in a previous study  <cit> . first, an empty m  ×n  matrix was given . then, gene sets mi  with a mutation probability pi were embedded in the matrix . for each sample, a gene uniformly chosen from mi with pi was mutated, and once one gene was mutated, the other genes in mi had a probability p <dig> to be mutated . finally, the genes not in mi were mutated in at most three samples. the second dataset, sim _data <dig>  was generated using the strategy described above for noisy probability p <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in steps of  <dig> .

the third dataset, sim _data <dig>  was generated as follows. starting with an empty r×s matrix , we embedded j gene sets n <dig> n <dig> ⋯,nj  into it. ni has size mi×n <dig> . ni was constructed according to the strategy like that for mi stated above. similarly, we mutated the genes not in ni at most in three samples.

we note that the average mutation rate for genes in a dataset in current simulation study is comparable to those of real datasets. for example, for sim _data <dig> with the noisy probabilities of  <dig>  and  <dig> , each gene has an average mutation rate  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. for the four biological datasets  introduced in the following subsection, each dataset has an average mutation rate of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for each gene, respectively.

biological data
to assess the proposed methods for practical applications, four biological datasets were collected due to their popularity and abundant prior knowledge. note that the comdp can be easily applied to other cancer mutation datasets.

the glioblastoma multiforme data  <dig>  and the lung adenocarcinoma dataset were obtained directly from a previous study  <cit> . these sets contain mutations in  <dig> genes across  <dig> gbm patients  and  <dig> genes in  <dig> lung cancer patients, respectively. the gbm <dig> and ovarian carcinoma datasets were obtained from another previous study  <cit> . these sets contain cnas for  <dig> genes spanning  <dig> gbm patients, somatic mutations for  <dig> genes across  <dig> gbm patients, cnas in  <dig> genes across  <dig> ovarian patients, and somatic mutations in  <dig> genes across  <dig> ovarian cancer patients. for the last two datasets, somatic mutations and cnas were first integrated by merging the genes on the common patients. finally, a binary mutation matrix a was obtained for each of the four datasets. the genes that are mutated in the same samples were combined into a gene set which was named as a metagene in this study. note that the definition of a metagene differs from that defined based on the matrix factorization method.

RESULTS
simulation study
comdp can get the optimal solution of the original maximum weight submatrix problem
like the blp model  <cit> , comdp can detect all the embedded gene sets in sim _data <dig> with k= <dig>  η= <dig> and λ< <dig> . in the current situation, comdp usually degenerates to find one gene set which corresponds to the optimal solution of blp. sometimes it can produce two gene sets with no common coverage. for example, with sim _data <dig> where ten gene sets were embedded in the  <dig>  ×  <dig>  matrix, we identified two sets with two and eight genes respectively, which are mutated in  <dig> and  <dig> samples respectively. but their common coverage is  <dig>  in fact, these two sets constitute one of the embedded gene sets which can be found using the blp method, so they can be viewed as the same driver gene set as obtained using blp directly.

note that as p <dig> increases, the exclusivity among the genes in mi decreases, so the detection of the embedded gene sets mi becomes more and more difficult. let k= <dig>  comdp  and blp were applied on sim _data <dig>  both were able to precisely identify all ten embedded gene sets when p0≤ <dig> . for blp, the average number of detected embedded gene sets decreased sharply as p <dig> increased. however, by properly choosing the parameter η, comdp can obtain more accurate and robust results than blp at high values of p <dig>  for example, comdp with λ=− <dig> and η= <dig> has much higher identification accuracy than blp for p0≥ <dig>  .figure  <dig>

comdp can identify co-occurring gene sets efficiently
we further applied comdp to sim _data <dig> to demonstrate its effectiveness, and assessed the effect of λ and η. we found that the results are robust with the selection of these two parameters. comdp can always get the embedded gene sets with the largest co-occurrence ratio  <dig>  for λ ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> in step of  <dig> and η ranging from - <dig> to - <dig> in step of  <dig>  the performance of comdp was also demonstrated on different η with λ= <dig> . for example, when η≤ <dig>  the two detected 5-gene sets mutated almost in the same samples . when η became larger the coverage difference of the two sets increased, and the common coverage became smaller. when η≥ <dig>  comdp detected one gene set with  <dig> genes, which had the coverage  <dig> and so the co-occurrence ratio was  <dig>  generally speaking, we found that comdp has similar performance when λ equals  <dig> or  <dig> . a high co-occurrence ratio  was obtained when η≤ <dig> , and a ratio of  <dig> was obtained when η≥ <dig> . the simulation study confirmed that λ> <dig> and η< <dig> are the proper selections for identifying co-occurring gene sets. in the following biological applications, without loss of generality, λ= <dig> and η=− <dig> were used.

applications to biological data
in this section, comdp was used on four biological datasets  to identify the co-occurring driver pathways with k=4∼ <dig>  we also demonstrated that mod_comdp  and ) was applied onto the ovarian carcinoma data to detect more driver pathways co-occurred with tp <dig> in carcinogenesis and to find multiple significant co-occurring driver pathways. each run for gbm <dig> and gbm <dig> datasets takes less than two seconds, and each run for the lung cancer dataset takes less than four seconds.

gbm <dig> dataset
for k= <dig>  two gene sets were detected: {cdkn2a, mg1} and {mtap, cyp27b1}  with individual significance p1= <dig> , p2= <dig> , co-occurrence significance p <dig> < <dig> , and co-occurrence ratio r <dig> = <dig>  . the two genes mtap and cdkn2a were found to be frequently co-deleted  <cit> . they are both located on chromosome 9p <dig>  a typical tumor suppressor region whose deletion is related to many different types of cancers. cyp27b <dig> and the metagene mg <dig> were mutated in the same patients with one exception: a single-nucleotide mutation was recorded in one additional patient for cyp27b <dig> . previous studies have suggested that cdk <dig> is the target of a common cna in the corresponding patients  <cit> . two protein products of cdkn2a, ink4a  and arf , are involved in the p <dig> and rb tumor suppressor pathways . it has been shown that any error disrupting these pathways causes tumor formation  <cit> . cdkn2a and cdk <dig> are considered part of the rb pathway. both mtap and cyp27b <dig> encode important enzymes. the enzymes encoded by mtap play a major role in polyamine metabolism and those encoded by cyp27b <dig> play a role in calcium metabolism and tissue differentiation.table  <dig>

for k= <dig>  two gene sets including {cdkn2a, tp <dig>  mg1} and {cdkn2b, cyp27b1} were detected with p1= <dig> , p2= <dig> , p <dig> < <dig>  and r <dig> = <dig> . cdkn2b encoding ink4b  also locates in chromosome 9p <dig> homozygous deletion region, and cdkn2b is usually co-deleted with cdkn2a. this disrupts the p <dig> and rb pathways. for this reason, combinatorial inactivation of cdkn2a and cdkn2b is frequently observed in these tumors. the cross-talk between the p <dig> and rb pathways  suggests that cdkn2a, tp <dig> and cdk <dig> are in the same pathway  or 3c).

for k= <dig>  two gene sets {cdkn2a, pten, cyp27b <dig>  kdr, mg2} and {cdkn2b, nf <dig>  rb <dig>  mg <dig>  erbb2} with p <dig> p <dig> and p <dig>  less than  <dig>  and r <dig> = <dig>  were identified . the first gene set was found to be involved in the p <dig> and pi3k/akt signaling pathways and the second in the rb and rtk/ras/erk signaling pathways. the rtk/ras/pi3k signaling pathway can also be induced by the mutations in these two gene sets . these pathways are implicated in biological processes associated with cell survival, cell cycle, protein synthesis, and cell proliferation. p <dig>  rb, and rtk/ras/pi3k have been previously reported to contribute to gbm pathogenesis in original tcga gbm studies  <cit> . five well-known tumor suppressors  are involved in these two gene sets. besides the co-occurrence of cdkn2a and cdkn2b, nf <dig> and rb <dig> in the second gene set have exclusive mutations, which are co-occurrent with mutations of pten in the first set . recently, several studies have shown the cooperativity of tumor suppressors in carcinogenesis . for example, rahrmann et al. demonstrated that co-occurring mutations in pten and nf <dig> cooperate in the development of grade  <dig> pnsts  in mice, suggesting that they may cooperate in human mpnst  progression  <cit> . another study by chow et al.
 <cit>  showed that cooperativity among pten, tp <dig>  and rb <dig> can cause high-grade astrocytoma in mouse adult brain, in which the majority of glioblastomas arise. for another two almost simultaneously mutated oncogenes cyp27b <dig> and cdk <dig> , beckner et al. have demonstrated their cooperative amplification and co-expression for potential modulation of vitamin d in glioblastomas  <cit> .figure  <dig>

on the other hand, wt <dig> encodes a transcription factor that plays an essential role in cellular development and cell survival  <cit> . it regulates the expression of numerous target genes, including the famous tumor suppressor tp <dig> and the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . kdr encodes a vegf  receptor. vegf plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and progression of malignant brain tumors. erbb <dig> encoding the protein her <dig>  is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor  family, and it has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of many different types of cancer. wt <dig>  kdr and erbb <dig> may drive the carcinogenesis of gbm, indicating that comdp can identify low-frequency candidate driver genes that play important roles in cancer initiation and development.

lung cancer
in this case, the significant results were obtained with k= <dig> , <dig> . for k= <dig> the co-occurring gene sets are {atm, tp53} and {egfr, kras}, and for k= <dig> they are {atm, tp53} and {egfr, kras, stk11}. as stated in a previous study  <cit> , atm and tp <dig> interact directly and are involved in the cell cycle checkpoint control  <cit> . egfr, kras and stk <dig> are all involved in the regulation of the mtor signaling pathway, whose dysregulation has been reported to be important to lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . however, the gene set {atm, tp53} can only be obtained by removing the mutations of {egfr, kras, stk11} from the dataset in the previous study by vandin  <cit> . here, these two gene sets were identified simultaneously and found to show significant co-occurrence. atm, tp <dig> are involved in the regulation of cell apoptosis and egfr, kras, stk <dig> are related to protein synthesis, indicating that the cooperativity of these two processes for the generation and progression of lung cancer.table  <dig>

gbm <dig> dataset
we observed that some new co-occurring gene sets were identified for gbm <dig> compared to gbm <dig> . for k= <dig>  we identified {cdkn2a, tp <dig>  mg <dig>  pik3r <dig>  taf1} and {cdkn2b, cyp27b <dig>  rb <dig>  syne1}  with p1= <dig> , p2< <dig> , p <dig> < <dig>  and r <dig> = <dig>  . in addition to the cooperative effects between cdkn2a and cdkn2b, tp <dig> and rb <dig> have been reported to have frequently co-occurring mutations related to several cancers, including the central nervous system tumor  <cit> . recently, the collaboration of tp <dig> and cdkn2b was also studied with respect to cell apoptosis and aneurysm formation  <cit> . on the other hand, for the two detected low-frequency mutated genes taf <dig>  and syne <dig> , taf <dig> encoding a transcription initiation factor phosphorylates tp <dig> during g <dig> cell-cycle progression, so taf <dig> may be a member of the p <dig> signaling pathway; syne <dig> was found to be associated with the gbm patients’ lifetime, and was therefore considered to be an important biomarker of glioblastoma survival  <cit> . our studies indicated that the p <dig>  rb, and the pi3k-related signaling pathways may collaboratively contribute to carcinogenesis in gbm via combined genetic alterations .table  <dig>

ovarian cancer
the mutation distribution among genes in the ovarian carcinoma data is quite nonuniform. among all the  <dig> samples, tp <dig> is mutated in  <dig> of them and all the other genes are mutated in less than 26% of samples. this indicates that tp <dig> plays a crucial role in the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer . determining whether there are other driver genes or pathways collaborating with tp <dig> will be helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of this cancer.

we applied comdp to the ovarian cancer data with k=4∼ <dig> . the first three rows in table  <dig> showed significantly co-occurring gene sets with tp <dig>  for k= <dig> we identified {myc, ccne <dig>  ninj <dig> mg5} . myc and ccne <dig> are two important proto-oncogenes involved in cell cycle progression. the functional correlation of myc and tp <dig> in the carcinogenic progression of ovarian carcinoma and other cancers have been evaluated in several studies . recently, kuhn et al. discovered that molecular genetic aberrations of ccne <dig> together with those of the p <dig> and pi3k pathways are major mechanisms in the development of uterine serous carcinoma  <cit> . both chkb and klhdc7b are located on chromosome 22q <dig> , where klhdc7b is involved in breast cancer and lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer and chkb encodes choline kinase  beta. de molina et al. demonstrated that chok acts as a link connecting phospholipid metabolism and cell cycle regulation  <cit> . it is here supposed that tp <dig> and chkb may regulate cdk4/ <dig> collaboratively to suppress the progression of ovarian cancer.table  <dig>

 <dig> is a metagene including two genes: chkb, klhdc7b. for k =  <dig> ∼  <dig> because of only one gene contained in the gene set  <dig>  the corresponding p-value equals  <dig> .



to identify other driver gene sets coupled to tp <dig>  we applied mod_comdp with r=1∼ <dig> to the ovarian cancer data and significant results were obtained for r=3∼ <dig> . for example, for r= <dig> we identified {myc, ccne <dig>  ninj <dig> mg <dig>  ush2a, nf <dig>  hmcn <dig>  znf <dig>  usp <dig> mg6}  with ra= <dig>  . frequent somatic mutations in nf <dig> have been previously shown to co-occur with tp <dig> mutations in ovarian carcinomas  <cit> . stmn <dig> and nf <dig> have been demonstrated to be involved in the mapk signaling pathway  <cit> . furthermore, to discover possible collaborations of multiple driver pathways with tp <dig>  we combined tp <dig> and the aforementioned 10-gene set into one nominal gene, which was considered mutated in a sample if both sets were mutated in that sample. then we applied mod_comdp to identify gene sets significantly co-occurring with the nominal gene. for r=1∼ <dig> we identified ppp2r2a, which is generally implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. kalev et al. revealed that ppp2r2a plays a critical role in dna double-strand break repair through modulation of atm phosphorylation  <cit> . youn and simon recently studied mutator alterations relevant to ovarian cancer  <cit> . besides the well-known mutator gene tp <dig>  they identified ppp2r2a and the chromosomal region 22q <dig>  as the new mutator candidates. we find that these so called mutator genes, which increase genomic instability when altered, may be collaboratively involved in the processes of dna synthesis and repair, chromosome segregation, damage surveillance, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis. the discovered driver patterns here may provide new information to enhance our understanding of the ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis, and further explorative analysis is needed to verify their biological relevance.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we proposed a method comdp for the de novo identification of co-occurring driver pathways in cancer. it considers two types of optimization simultaneously: first, it makes the maximization of the weight w for each individual pathway, i.e., high coverage and high exclusivity. second, it ensures that the maximization of the inter-overlap between the pathway pair. simulation study indicated that for a range of values of the parameters λ and η, comdp can always get the exact solution. it was here demonstrated that comdp has the following characteristics:  it can identify individual driver gene sets as blp  <cit>  or dendrix  <cit> .  it obtains more accurate and robust results when the noise increases.  it uses no prior information such as the incomplete knowledge about the pathways and protein interaction networks.  comdp is an exact method and the procedure is quite fast.

when the project approximated to the end, we noticed that leiserson et al. proposed a method for the simultaneous identification of multiple driver pathways  <cit> . the present study is related to leiserson’s but in many ways quite different. first, the so-called dendrix ilp in  <cit>  is the same as the blp method  <cit> . second, the weight function used by their multi-dendrix algorithm does not explicitly incorporate co-occurrence of mutations between genes in different pathways  <cit> . the multi-dentrix of the two gene sets was found to be a special form of the present model with λ= <dig> and η= <dig>  our simulation study demonstrated that, in this case, the coverage of the two sets detected was  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. although the union coverage got larger , a lower co-occurrence ratio  <dig>  was obtained because of the smaller common coverage. this also indicates that the multiple driver pathways  identified by multi-dendrix cannot be guaranteed to be co-occurring.

we note that the heterogeneity among tumors can affect the findings of the current method. investigating combinatorial patterns of driver pathways in different subtypes will be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and designing efficient treatments for cancer patients. it will be interesting to explore the effect of heterogeneity among tumors in the future studies.

in summary, we have developed a method to identify co-occurring driver pathways, which may reveal the functional cooperation of different driver pathways during carcinogenesis. the results of this study show that the present method will be a powerful tool to explore the collaborative effects among mutated driver pathways and enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms.
