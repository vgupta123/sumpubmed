BACKGROUND
the process of adipocyte differentiation is ascribed to the activation of the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. several transcriptional regulators, including cytidine-cytidine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine /enhancer-binding proteins  and the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferators activated receptor γ , play pivotal roles in the early stages of this process  <cit> . these factors control the expression of adipocyte-specific genes by means of direct interaction with pparγ or c/ebp binding sites within the promoters of these genes  <cit> . pparγ is an important key regulator of adipogenesis. overexpression of pparγ induces the accumulation of lipid droplets and the generation of adipocyte-like characteristics in differentiated fibroblast cells  <cit> . in contrast, decreased fat mass and a smaller size of adipocytes are observed in heterozygous pparγ-deficient mice  <cit> . pparγ is crucial for adipogenesis, and pparγ is the only factor described so far that is both necessary and sufficient to promote adipogenesis. there are two isoforms of pparγ: pparγ <dig> and pparγ <dig>  the latter has been shown to be an adipocyte-specific isoform and is more efficient than pparγ <dig> in promoting adipocyte differentiation. pparγ <dig> contains an additional  <dig> amino acids at its n-terminus, that is not present in pparγ <dig>  thus indicating that the transcription of each isoform is initiated at different start sites, and that it is differentially controlled  <cit> .

extensive studies over the past several years have revealed that adipose tissue not only has a role in storing energy as triglycerides, but also has an important role in controlling overall metabolism through the secretion of various hormones called adipokines  <cit> . the secretion profile of these adipokines is altered by obesity, which is characterized by both hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes. this change in adipokine secretion first leads to insulin resistance, which represents an important component of the development of metabolic syndrome as typified by type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  <cit> . obese conditions induce a decline in the activity and amount of pparγ, the master regulator of adipogenesis, which disturbs adipocyte metabolism. various changes in the activity and expression of pparγ in obesity have been reported, including a decrease in transcription and translation  <cit> , activation of the degradation of both its mrna and protein  <cit> , and a decline of the ligand-binding affinity of pparγ by post-translational modification  <cit> . although the details of the regulatory mechanisms controlling the activity and the amount of pparγ at the various levels remains unclear, these alterations appear to be strongly associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. to date, thiazolidinediones , pparγ agonists, are some of the more effective treatments used for improvement of insulin resistance.

dna methylation results from the transfer by dna methyltransferase of a methyl group from s-adenosylmethionine to the cytosine residue within cpg dinucleotides. dna methylation has been established to be an important epigenetic marker of the transcriptionally repressed state of the genes  <cit> . there are two general mechanisms by which dna methylation inhibits gene expression. the first is that modification of cytosine bases can directly inhibit the association of dna binding factors owing to steric hindrance, and the second, more important mechanism is where various proteins that recognize methylated cpg sites recruit transcriptional corepressor molecules so as to silence transcription. those corepressors, such as histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodeling enzymes, can function independently or may act in concert with factors mediating dna methylation so as to generate the transcriptionally repressed structure of chromatin  <cit> . several studies have reported that epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are involved in the transcriptional activation of pparγ <dig> during adipogenesis  <cit> . during the differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes to adipocytes, the swi/snf  chromatin remodeling complex and histone modifying enzymes lead to chromatin remodeling that is followed by the sequential binding of polii, tata binding protein  and other transcription factors to activate the transcription of pparγ  <cit> . however, few studies have clearly demonstrated an active contribution of dna methylation of the pparγ promoter to its expression in adipocytes  <cit> .

in this report, we demonstrate that the expression of the pparγ <dig> gene is affected by dna methylation of its promoter. we show that transcription of pparγ was repressed in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes and that its promoter was methylated. during adipogenesis, activation of pparγ expression was associated with demethylation of its promoter. the activation of the endogenous gene in cultured cells by treatment with a dna methylation inhibitor and the reduced luciferase reporter gene expression from an in vitro methylated pparγ reporter plasmid provided supporting evidence that the expression of pparγ mrna is controlled by dna methylation of its promoter. we also demonstrate that methylation of the pparγ <dig> promoter was increased in visceral adipose tissues of obese diabetic mouse models compared to that observed in wild-type mice. there was a concomitant reduction in pparγ mrna in the obese mice compared to the level in wild-type mice. taken together, we propose that perturbation of epigenetic regulation of the pparγ <dig> gene during obesity causes a reduction in the expression of pparγ, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.

RESULTS
dna demethylation of pparγ promoter in 3t3-l <dig> adipocyte differentiation
since pparγ is the key regulator of adipogenic differentiation, its transcription is highly restricted in most of cell types  <cit> . real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  of total pparγ mrna revealed that its expression is strongly inhibited in nih/3t <dig> fibroblasts and somewhat less so in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes . expression of pparγ mrna in nih/3t <dig> cells was approximately 3% of that observed in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes. in contrast, expression of pparγ mrna in differentiated 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes  was approximately  <dig> times greater than that observed in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes. to examine the contribution of epigenetic factors, such as dna methylation, on the transcriptional regulation of pparγ expression, we first compared the methylation status of the pparγ promoter region in nih-3t <dig> cells, preadipocytes  and adipocytes  using the bisulfite sequencing method. there are seven cpg methylation sites flanking the transcription start site  of the murine pparγ <dig> gene . we examined the methylation status of these seven sites in promoter fragments isolated from  <dig> cells of each cell type . in nih/3t <dig> cells, which express a low level of pparγ mrna, almost all of these sites were methylated. a significant fraction of these sites were also methylated in 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes, although the extent of methylation was lower than that observed in nih/3t <dig> cells. in contrast, the cpg sites located upstream of the tss in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes were mostly demethylated after differentiation to adipocytes. these results indicated that methylation of the cpg sites upstream of the tss correlates inversely with pparγ mrna expression. thus, cpg methylation of these sites in the pparγ promoter might contribute to silencing of its expression. the two cpg sites located downstream of the tss, at positions + <dig> and + <dig>  were methylated in each cell type suggesting that methylation of these cpg sites does not contribute to the regulation of pparγ mrna expression.

contribution of dna methylation to pparγ expression
to further evaluate a causal relationship between methylation of the pparγ promoter and the expression of pparγ mrna, we examined the effect of 5'-aza-cytideine , an inhibitor of dna methylation, on pparγ mrna expression in nih/3t <dig> cells. after  <dig> h treatment with  <dig> and  <dig> μm 5'-aza-c, pparγ expression was analyzed quantitatively by real time rt-pcr. as shown in figure 2a, the expression of pparγ mrna increased following 5'-aza-c treatment in a dose-dependent manner. in contrast, treatment of cells with trichostatin a , an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, for  <dig> h, had no effect on pparγ mrna expression . these results suggest that dna methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation of the expression of pparγ and that the role of dna methylation is dominant to that of histone acetylation, at least under these experimental conditions tested here.

to further confirm the effect of dna methylation on the pparγ promoter region, we performed luciferase reporter assays in nih/3t <dig> cells following transfection of a reporter plasmid comprising  <dig> kb of the 5'-upstream region of pparγ containing five cpg sites  placed upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. transfection of the pparγ reporter construct led to the expression of  <dig> -fold more luciferase activity relative to that of the empty vector  . in contrast, in vitro dna methylation of the reporter construct prior to transfection reduced the expression of the luciferase reporter to a level similar to that observed when using the empty vector . these results further suggest that transcription of the pparγ gene is regulated through cpg methylation of the promoter.

the same 5'-aza-c treatment and luciferase assays were next performed on 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes  and adipocytes . in contrast to the results observed in nih/3t <dig> cells, we observed no increase in pparγ mrna in 5'-aza-c-treated preadipocytes . this result suggested that, in preadipocytes, dna demethylation alone is not sufficient for the activation of the pparγ promoter. similar results were obtained from following luciferase reporter assays in preadipocytes . the unmethylated pparγ reporter construct did not give rise to increased luciferase expression and instead expressed a similar level of luciferase as the promoterless construct in preadipocytes. luciferase expression from the promoterless construct in preadipocytes was similar to the level observed in nih/3t <dig> cells. these results suggested the existence of an inhibitory mechanism that represses expression from the demethylated pparγ promoter in preadipocytes, or alternatively, an activating mechanism that induces the expression of the demethylated pparγ promoter in nih/3t <dig> cells.

luciferase expression from the in vitro methylated reporter construct was strongly repressed in preadipocytes . indeed, luciferase reporter expression from the methylated pparγ construct was further reduced to 18% of that of the promoterless control construct, suggesting that preadipocytes inhibit transcription from the methylated pparγ promoter more robustly than nih/3t <dig> cells. these data further support the idea that the expression from the pparγ promoter is under the control of its promoter methylation.

as was expected, luciferase reporter expression from the unmethylated pparγ reporter vector was very efficient in differentiating adipocytes , in which the endogenous pparγ gene is activated . in contrast, luciferase reporter expression from the in vitro methylated promoter construct remained low in adipocytes, despite the presence of a suitable environment for activation of the transcription of the pparγ promoter. these results further suggest that dna methylation contributes to the regulation of expression of pparγ mrna. in addition, although there are structural differences between endogenous chromatin and exogenous reporter plasmids, dna methylation of the pparγ promoter may be a dominant regulatory mechanism that can override activation of the pparγ promoter by other transcription factors during adipogenesis.

kinetic analysis of pparγ promoter demethylation
for further analysis of pparγ methylation in adipocytes, we next investigated the time course of promoter demethylation during adipocyte differentiation of 3t3-l <dig> cells. bisulfite-converted pcr amplicons of the pparγ promoter of the cells were digested with the restriction enzyme, hpych4iv. the level of demethylation was estimated by the cutting efficiency every  <dig> h . we could detect demethylation of the promoter immediately following induction of differentiation and the demethylation increased gradually until it reached a plateau on day  <dig> .

the level of pparγ mrna was also monitored by real time rt-pcr . similar to the time course of demethylation of the promoter, the amount of pparγ mrna gradually increased until it reached a plateau on day  <dig>  although the starting time of the increase in mrna appeared to lag  <dig> to  <dig> days behind the start of promoter demethylation and differentiation induction. this synchronization supports the idea that transcriptional activation of the pparγ gene is regulated by dna methylation/demethylation. the observed lag time probably indicates that promoter demethylation is not the only factor controlling pparγ expression. the differentiation stimulus induces the recruitment of several transcriptional regulators that increase the expression of pparγ, including c/ebps, sterol regulatory element binding protein , and swi/snf family chromatin remodeling enzymes to the pparγ promoter, and the observed lag in pparγ expression might be due to a requirement to recruit these factors to the promoter so as to activate transcription following dna demethylation  <cit> .

during adipogenesis of 3t3-l <dig> cells, genomic dna is newly synthesized during two cycles of mitosis termed the mitotic clonal expansion   <cit> . the replication of methylated dna produces hemimethylated cpg sites, which could cause loss of dna methylation if those sites are not remethylated by dnmt <dig>  the maintenance dna methyltransferase  <cit> . we next investigated whether the demethylation of the pparγ promoter during differentiation is caused by passive demethylation during dna replication through mce. to do this, we compared cell growth and demethylation of the pparγ promoter during differentiation . the number of the cells increased immediately following induction of differentiation, expanding fourfold by day  <dig>  suggesting that two cycles of cell division had occurred. in contrast, as shown in figure 3a, dna demethylation increased gradually up day  <dig>  and we observed no immediate demethylation that corresponding to the increase in cell number on approximately day  <dig>  this result demonstrates that pparγ promoter demethylation is not a passive process caused by mce, but that it is instead an active process of epigenetic regulation of the transcriptional activity of the pparγ promoter.

chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the pparγ promoter during 3t3-l <dig> adipocyte differentiation
promoter dna methylation represses the transcription of a downstream gene both directly and indirectly. methylated cpg sites within the promoter itself can directly inhibit the binding of transcription factors due to steric hindrance and thereby repress transcription. alternatively, methylated cpg binding domain  proteins, which specifically bind to methylated cpg residues, recruit other enzymes that modify histone tails or chromatin structure, so as to indirectly create a repressed state of chromatin  <cit> . to assess the protein interactions on the methylated pparγ promoter region, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays to evaluate the binding of certain mbd proteins to the pparγ promoter. the chip assay revealed that methyl cpg binding protein  <dig>  was associated with the methylated pparγ promoter in preadipocytes  . we were unable to detect the binding of other mbds, such as mbd <dig> and mbd2a, to the promoter in preadipocytes . in contrast, we detected the binding of mbd2a to the promoter in nih/3t <dig> cells, suggesting that mbd binding to the pparγ promoter differs between nih/3t <dig> and 3t3-l <dig> cells .

dissociation of mecp <dig> from the promoter was nearly complete within  <dig> to  <dig> days following the induction of differentiation , although promoter demethylation continued gradually until it reached a plateau on day  <dig> . an increase in the level of histone h <dig> acetylation in the pparγ promoter region has been reported until day  <dig>  <cit> , and mecp <dig> has been shown to recruit the protein complex including histone deacetylases to methylated cpg sites  <cit> . thus, the increase in histone acetylation is likely caused by dissociation of mecp <dig> on days  <dig> to  <dig> following the induction of differentiation. this result further suggests that dna methylation plays a greater role than histone acetylation on the regulation of the expression of pparγ mrna.

we next evaluated other types of histone modifications in 3t3-l <dig> cells following the induction of differentiation. on day  <dig>  we observed dimethylation of histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig> , which represents a repressed state of chromatin, on the pparγ promoter. this dimethylation disappeared within  <dig> day of the induction of differentiation . the demethylation of h3k9me <dig> occurred at a stage in the differentiation process that preceded dna demethylation, the expression of pparγ and even mce , and so therefore was not synchronous with pparγ expression and therefore was not responsible for the induction of its expression. this result suggests that demethylation of h3k9me <dig> is insufficient to induce the expression of pparγ mrna. in contrast, the level of dimethylation of lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig> , which represents an activated state of chromatin, was low prior to the induction of differentiation, but increased gradually following induction . the kinetics of this gradual increase appeared to mirror that of the dna demethylation and the increase in mrna expression, suggesting that h3k <dig> dimethylation correlates well with dna demethylation.

dna methylation and mrna expression of pparγ in white adipose tissues of mouse models of diabetes
pparγ not only acts to induce adipogenesis, but also to maintain the functional phenotype of adipocytes. thus, the expression and epigenetic regulation of pparγ mrna might also be important for the maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype, and any defect in this regulation could become a pathogenic factor in metabolic syndromes. in other words, changes in the epigenetic status of the pparγ gene might be observed in adipose tissues under pathogenic conditions. to test this possibility, we analyzed methylation of the pparγ promoter in white adipose tissues  and compared the methylation profiles of the promoter in wild-type mice and mouse models of diabetes. wat are classified into two main types: subcutaneous adipose tissue  and visceral adipose tissue . visceral obesity has been linked strongly to diabetic insulin resistance  <cit> . therefore, we compared the methylation status of the pparγ promoter in both types of wat.

we first compared promoter methylation in wat isolated from 10-week-old wild-type  and +leprdb/+leprdb  mice. the db/db mouse is a well established model of diabetes that contains a homozygous mutation in the leptin receptor gene. this mouse exhibits a phenotype similar to type  <dig> diabetes mellitus owing to hyperphagia and disrupted metabolism of adipocytes. we prepared genomic dna from the two types of wat: the inguinal part of the sat and the visceral, epididymal adipose tissues . the genomic dna was treated with sodium bisulfite, and the methylation status of two cpg sites within the pparγ promoter, at positions - <dig> bp and - <dig>  was estimated based on the efficiency of hpych4iv restriction enzyme digestion  . as shown in figure 5a, the fraction of methylated cpg sites at both positions - <dig> bp and - <dig> in sat was reduced in db/db mice compared to wt mice. the - <dig> site in particular was methylated to a much lesser extent in db/db mice  than in wt mice  . since the sat in db/db mice was greatly enlarged relative to that in wt mice because of hyperphagia , the reduced level of methylation of the cpg sites in the pparγ promoter in the sat of db/db mice relative to the level in wt mice suggests a possible enrichment of differentiated, pparγ-expressing adipocytes in the sat of db/db mice.

interestingly, despite the hypertrophy of the eat in db/db mice , methylation of the cpg at position - <dig> in the pparγ promoter was increased somewhat in db/db mice relative to the level observed in wt mice . approximately 36% of the cytosines at the site were methylated in wt mice, whereas 50% of such sites were methylated in db/db mice. the level of expression of pparγ <dig> mrna in the sat and eat differed between wt and db/db mice to an extent that mirrored qualitatively the differences in methylation . whereas the expression of pparγ <dig> mrna in the sat of db/db mice was four times greater than that in wt mice, the level of pparγ mrna in the eat of db/db mice was about one-third of that observed in wt mice, which correlated inversely with the level of methylation within the pparγ promoter, particularly with that at the cpg at - <dig> bp.

to our surprise, the hypertrophic eat in db/db mice, which likely contains a large number of differentiated adipocytes, expressed a decreased level of pparγ mrna compared to that observed in the smaller eat in wt mice, presumably due to the greater extent of methylation of the pparγ promoter in the eat of db/db mice. a reduction in the level and/or activity of pparγ has been previously suggested to be linked to the development of diabetic symptoms such as insulin resistance  <cit> . these results suggest that enhanced methylation of the pparγ promoter and the concomitant reduction of pparγ mrna in the eat may be linked causally to the diabetic phenotype induced by obesity in db/db mice.

to further characterize this correlation, we next analyzed methylation of the pparγ promoter in adipocytes from a mouse model of diet-induced obesity , which are wt mice fed with a high-fat diet from  <dig> to  <dig> weeks old that subsequently present a type  <dig> diabetes-like phenotype. although dio mice also had an excessive amount of sat owing to their diet , the level of methylation of the pparγ promoter in the sat of these mice was similar to that observed in the sat of 20-week-old wt mice . the level of expression of pparγ <dig> mrna was similar in the sat of dio and wt mice .

however, cells of the hypertrophic eat of dio mice  also exhibited enhanced methylation of the cpg at position - <dig> than was observed in cells of the smaller eat of wt mice , as had been observed in cells of the eat of db/db mice relative to that observed in wt mice . approximately 40% of the cytosines at the site were methylated in wt mice, whereas 56% of such sites were methylated in dio mice. consistent with these findings, the expression of pparγ <dig> mrna was similarly reduced in the eat of dio mice . these results suggest that, as in the eat of db/db mice, pparγ mrna expression is reduced owing to promoter dna methylation in the enlarged eat of mice fed the high-fat diet, and further support the possibility that increased methylation of the pparγ promoter in the obese eat contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we found that the promoter of the pparγ <dig> gene is demethylated during adipogenesis of 3t3-l <dig> cells, and confirmed that the expression of the pparγ <dig> gene is under the control of dna methylation within its promoter region. although a previous study reported that the pparγ <dig> promoter is differentially methylated in a tissue-dependent manner  <cit> , a correlation between the promoter methylation and the expression has not previously been established. here, we showed that the methylated promoters of 3t3-l <dig> preadipocytes were site-specifically demethylated following the induction of differentiation, and that the expression of pparγ mrna increased as the demethylation proceeded. the demethylation of the endogenous gene observed in cultured cells treated with 5'-aza-cytidine and the inhibition of the expression of a luciferase reporter gene following in vitro methylation of the pparγ reporter plasmid prior to transfection provided supporting evidence that the expression of pparγ mrna is controlled by dna methylation of the pparγ promoter.

our luciferase reporter assays revealed that dna methylation of the pparγ promoter could repress transcription of a downstream reporter gene even in differentiating adipocytes . this finding indicates the dominant inhibitory effect of dna methylation over the action of transcription factors that bind the promoter sequence to induce the expression of pparγ. since the reporter plasmids do not exhibit a higher order chromatin structure similar to genomic dna, the dominance of dna methylation over the chromatin-related factors that induce mrna expression, such as histone modifications and chromatin remodeling enzymes, remains to be demonstrated. although controversial, the results of the chip assays  and the results following tsa treatment of the cells  provided additional evidence that promoter methylation works predominantly to some of these factors such as histone acetylation and dimethylation of h3k <dig> 

we have not yet tested whether the expression of the human pparγ gene is under the control of promoter methylation. previous studies reported that cpg sites upstream of the tss of the human pparγ <dig> gene are differentially methylated in different cell types. the cpg sites were hypomethylated in stromal vascular cells isolated from human adipose tissue and hypermethylated in t cells that do not express pparγ <dig>  <cit> . however, the study also reported no significant alteration in the methylation of the pparγ promoter following adipogenesis of the stromal cells  <cit> . sequence alignment of the human and murine pparγ <dig> promoters reveals that most of the methylation sites are either conserved or located within approximately  <dig> bp upstream or downstream of each other . taken together, we hypothesize that the human pparγ <dig> gene is also regulated by dna methylation, although the human promoter contains additional cpg sites approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the tss that do not exist in the murine gene.

in this study, we first investigated and compared the dna methylation of the pparγ gene in sat and vat. in the case of sat, the age  of the mice and the amount of differentiated cells in the tissue seemed to affect the methylation profile of pparγ promoter . the level of promoter methylation observed in cells of the smaller sat from  <dig> week-old wt mice was greater than that observed in the larger, more differentiated sat of db/db mice or in the sat of  <dig> week-old wt and dio mice.

in contrast, the extent of pparγ promoter methylation observed in adipocytes of the eat seemed to be controlled predominantly by the animals' dietary habits, such as the hyperphagia in +leprdb/+leprdb mice and the high-fat diet in diet-induced obesity mice . these dietary habits increased methylation of the pparγ promoter at position - <dig> in these diabetic mouse models. corresponding decreases were observed in the expression of pparγ <dig> mrna . the increase in methylation of the pparγ promoter was unexpected, because we anticipated that the hypertrophic eat of the diabetic mice would contain a greater number of differentiated adipocytes, and thus present a more highly demethylated promoter. although we have not yet examined the methylation status of other cpg sites, such as those at positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig>  the level of methylation at these sites may be similar or increased in the db/db and dio mice relative to the levels in wt mice, since we detected reduced pparγ mrna expression in these diabetic mouse models.

the mechanism behind the difference in the methylation status of the pparγ promoter in cells of the eat between wt and diabetic mice remains unclear. the obesity-inducing dietary habits of the model mice causes various changes such as endoplasmic reticulum  stress and oxidative stress caused by hypertrophy of adipocytes, an alteration of the composition of accumulated fat, or increase of free fatty acid in blood  <cit> . some of these factors might have affected the observed methylation excess in the eat of the diabetic mice.

three possible hypotheses about the mechanism can be considered. the first hypothesis is that the population of undifferentiated preadipocytes, whose pparγ promoters are methylated, increases in the eat leading to an excess of promoter methylation in the whole tissue. the increase in the population of undifferentiated preadipocytes might represent an adaptation of the tissue to the high-load dietary habits, through the generation of increased numbers of preadipocytes that could subsequently differentiate into adipocytes that are capable of storing triglycerides. otherwise, obesity-inducing dietary habits might lead to the accumulation of preadipocytes in the eat whose potential for differentiation is impaired, such that the eat might accumulate preadipocytes in which the pparγ promoter is methylated, leading to an excess of methylation in the whole tissue. adipocytes secrete a large amount of the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α  during the development of obesity, which contributes to the induction of insulin resistance  <cit> . tnfα can also prevent the differentiation of cultured 3t3-l <dig> cells and human primary adipocyte precursor cells  <cit> . thus, tnfα secreted in obese animals might inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes in the eat and result in the accumulation of preadipocytes.

the second hypothesis is that remethylation or impaired demethylation of the pparγ promoter may occur in adipocytes of the eat of diabetic mice. the remethylation of the demethylated promoter in differentiated adipocytes might represent an adaptation of obese adipocytes that are no longer able to accumulate lipid by reducing the expression of pparγ, which would otherwise continue to promote lipid synthesis and accumulation. the third hypothesis is that the obese condition induces an increase in cell populations other than adipocytes in the eat of diabetic mice. for example, obese eat may require a greater number of vascular cells for supplying blood to the developing tissue. obesity also induces macrophage infiltration of the stroma of adipose tissue  <cit> . at this time, we have no data regarding the cell types that specifically accumulate in obese eat. however, we exclusively detected the changes of pparγ <dig> mrna in the presented experiments, and no significant difference was observed in the expression of pparγ <dig>  the pparγ that the other cell types, such as vascular cells and macrophages, mainly express . additional histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissue sections that evaluate the precise cellular populations of preadipocytes, adipocytes and others in the obese tissue should provide additional information that may help determine which of these three hypotheses is more likely to explain the unexpected excess in the level of pparγ promoter methylation in the eat of diabetic mice.

obesity-induced alterations in the metabolism of adipose tissue, such as reprogramming of the adipokine secretion profile, is known to contribute to the pathology of insulin resistance leading to metabolic syndrome. thiazolidine derivatives are pparγ agonists that are used to treat patients with type  <dig> diabetes mellitus. these agents improve the perturbed adipokine secretion and the insulin resistance, thereby further implicating a decline in the activity and level of pparγ in the pathogenesis of diabetes  <cit> . in this study, we have shown that alteration of the adipokine secretion profile as a result of obesity might be attributable, at least partially, to the decreased expression of pparγ mediated by he epigenetic changes in the vat. although the mechanism behind the excess of dna methylation remains to be demonstrated, this finding and following researches into the mechanism will provide a new knowledge of the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.
