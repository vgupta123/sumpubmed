BACKGROUND
starch granules in plants are classified into two types according to their physiological role. some starch granules are stored for long periods in reserve tissues as storage starch. this type of starch is an important source of carbohydrates for human beings. other types of starch are stored temporarily as transient starch to provide carbon and energy for plant growth. transient starch is synthesized in chloroplasts during the day and consumed during the night. storage starch granules are synthesized in the plastid stroma by joint action of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylases , starch synthases , starch branching enzymes , starch debranching enzymes  and their isoforms; however, the synthesis and regulation of transient granules hold a specific feature  <cit> . some synthase isoforms that synthesize storage starch are different from those that synthesize transient starch.

agpase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of starch, it catalyzes the synthesis of adp-glucose, which is the substrate of amylose starch, and over expression of the agpase gene enhances the rate of starch biosynthesis . amylose, one of the main forms of starch, is synthesized from the substrate, adp-glucose, by granule-bound starch synthase . the isoform gbss <dig> is responsible for amylose synthesis in leaves and other non-storage tissues , whereas amylopectin, the other major form of starch, is synthesized by the coordinated actions of agpase, ss, and sbe. five soluble ss isozymes, ssi, ssii, ssiii, ssiv, and ssv are found in plant genomes  <cit> ; and among them, ssi, ssii, and ssiii are involved in amylopectin elongation  <cit> . isoform ssi is highly expressed in plant leaves  <cit> . two or three isoforms of ssii and ssiii are found in the genomes of different species, and at least one isoform is expressed in leaves and regulates starch granule biosynthesis . only one ssiv isoform is found in the arabidopsis genome; atssiv is involved in the initiation of starch granule formation in leaves  <cit> . overexpression of atssiv increases the levels of starch accumulation by 30–40% and results in a higher rate of growth  <cit> ; ssiv mutants have remarkably decreased numbers of granules and abnormal granules  <cit> .

the functions of ssiv isozymes in the leaves of cereal crops are not as clear as in arabidopsis. two ssiv isoforms, ssiva and ssivb, are found in rice. ssiva is mainly expressed in the endosperm and is responsible for starch accumulation in seeds, whereas ssivb is mainly expressed in leaves at early development stages and is responsible for leaf granule biosynthesis  <cit> . it also has overlapping and crucial roles with ssiiia in rice seeds in determining granule morphology and in maintaining the amyloplast envelope structure  <cit> . zmssiv is highly expressed in the embryo, endosperm and pericarp in maize. in wheat, only one isoform of ssiv has been identified until now. this gene is located on the long chromosome arm of homologous group i and shows high similarity with osssivb, so this isoform is named tassivb  <cit> . tassivb is preferentially expressed in leaves and is not regulated by the circadian clock  <cit> . tassivb is also highly expressed at the middle stages of seed development  <cit> ; however, the impact of tassivb on wheat leaf and seed granule characteristics at different growth stages have not yet been reported due to the lack of mutant lines.

tilling  is a powerful approach for novel allele identification and has been used to screen mutagenized plant populations for novel alleles of target genes . hundreds of missense and nonsense mutant alleles of key starch synthesis-related wheat genes, such as tassii, tasbeiia, tasbeiib, have been identified using this platform  <cit> . a hexaploid wheat line containing two waxy homozygous mutations created through tilling and a pre-existing deletion of a third waxy homoeolog displays a near-null phenotype  <cit> . novel alleles of tasbeii have been identified in both durum wheat and bread wheat. double mutant lines combining a tasbeiia-a mutation with a tasbeiia-b mutation in durum wheat and triple mutant lines combining mutations in tasbeiia-a, tasbeiia-b with tasbeiia-d have a significant increase in both amylose and resistant starch content . using this approach to identify novel alleles of tassivb would be helpful in characterizing its role in transient starch granule synthesis in wheat leaves.

in this paper, we used the tilling approach to identify novel alleles of tassivb–d with mutations in functional regions in an ethyl methanesulphonate  mutagenized population derived from an elite hexaploid wheat cultivar. homozygous mutants were used to investigate the specific role of tassivb-d in starch granule synthesis in leaves at different stages of growth. we found that tassivb-d mutations decrease gene expression and the number of starch granules in leaves.

RESULTS
novel alleles of tassivb-d in a mutagenized population
three primer sets corresponding to tassivb-d were designed for allele mining , and their specificities were validated using nullisomic-tetrasomic lines . the location of these primers on the tassivb-d sequence is shown in fig. 1b.table  <dig> primer sequences used for allele mining

in the mutagenised population,  <dig> mutations were identified with a mutation density of 1/ <dig> kb. among these mutations,  <dig> are g to a  or c to t  transition point mutations, and the other  <dig> are t insertions. of these mutations,  <dig> are in the coding region , including  <dig> nonsense mutation ,  <dig> missense mutations and  <dig> silent mutations. the remaining  <dig> are located in introns and include  <dig> splice junction mutations.table  <dig> mutations identified in the coding region of the tassiv b-d gene

using sift program, five missense mutations  are predicted to have a severe impact on protein function. based on the pssm program, three missense mutations  are predicted to have a severe impact. as the nonsense mutant e054- <dig> results in the loss of both the starch catalytic domain and glycosyltranferase domain, it might have a severe impact on protein function. because the e <dig> mutation is located in the glycosyltranferase domain which has less similarity with other ss isoforms  <cit> , and might have distinct functions from other starch synthases, mutants e <dig> and e054- <dig> were selected for analysis of gene expression and starch granule number.

the expression of tassivb in mutant leaves at different growth stages
specific primer sets for each sub-genome  were used to analyze the pattern of tassivb gene expression. in wild type, gene expression profiling revealed non-significant differences in expression between different growth stages . in the mutants, tassivb-d was down-regulated, and tassivb-a and tassivb-b did not show significant compensatory responses. the expression of tassivb-d in the nonsense mutant e054- <dig> was reduced by ~8-fold compared with the wild type at all three growth stages, whereas in e <dig>  its expression level gradually increased with plant growth and only showed a significant reduction  at the seedling stage . in contrast, no significant differences in the expression of tassivb-a  and tassivb-b , were detected in the two tassivb-d mutants at all three stages, except for tassivb-a expression in the e054- <dig> mutant at the seedling stage .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of the three homeologous tassivb genes in leaves at different stages. a relative expression level of tassivb-d; b relative expression level of tassivb-a; c relative expression level of tassivb-b. error bars represent standard deviation; wt: wild type; * means significantly different from wt at the p =  <dig>  level and ** means significantly different from wt at the p =  <dig>  level based on student’s t test




variation in the number of starch granules in the chloroplast
we investigated starch granule characteristics in the chloroplasts of wild type and the two mutants at three growth stages . granule number varied plast by plast in each genotype, with numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and more than 90% of chloroplasts contained no more than  <dig> granules . the difference between the wild type and mutants was mainly in the number of chloroplasts containing no more than  <dig> granules.fig.  <dig> starch granules observed in the chloroplasts of wild type  and tassivb-d e054- <dig>  and e <dig>  mutants by transmission electron microscopy. arrows indicate starch granules, bars =  <dig> μm




the biggest difference in granule number per chloroplast was observed at the seedling stage, and mutation of tassivb-d led to a reduction in granule number. the percentage of chloroplasts with 0– <dig> granules in both mutants, e054- <dig>  and e <dig> , were significantly higher compared with wild type  , whereas at the elongation and heading stages, the difference between e <dig> and wild type became smaller; only the e054- <dig> mutant had a significantly higher percentage of chloroplasts with 0– <dig> and 3– <dig> granules . in contrast, the percentage of chloroplasts containing 3– <dig> granules was lower in the mutants than in wild type. at the seedling stage, the percentage of chlorplasts in e054- <dig> and e <dig> with 3– <dig> granules was  <dig> % and  <dig> % lower than wild type, respectively. at the elongation and heading stages, only the e054- <dig> mutant was significantly different from wild type; the percentage of chlorplasts with 3– <dig> granules was  <dig> % and  <dig> % lower than wild type, respectively. the observation of the chloroplast granule number phenotype at all stages for the e054- <dig> mutant and only at the seedling stage for the e <dig> mutant is consistent with the lower levels of tassivb-d gene expression in the mutants at these stages .fig.  <dig> percentage of chloroplasts in wild type  and tassivb-d mutants  containing 0– <dig> and 3– <dig> granules at three different growth stages. a seedling stage; b elongation stage; c heading stage. the percentage of chloroplasts equals the number chloroplasts containing 0– <dig> and 3– <dig> starch granules divided by the total number of chloroplasts observed. * means significantly different from wt at the p =  <dig>  level and ** means significantly different from wt at the p =  <dig>  level




photosynthesis parameters and the efficiency of psii
as transient starch in chloroplasts provides carbon and energy for plant growth, we deduced that photosynthesis might be affected by reduced granule numbers. granule numbers in the mutant e054- <dig> were more severely reduced than those in e <dig>  and the impact on photosynthesis parameters are expected to be more severe. therefore, photosynthesis parameters in the mutant e054- <dig> and the wild type at the heading stage were compared to determine the impact of reduced granule number. we found that the maximum quantum yield  and yield of psii ) of e054- <dig> were significantly lower than in wild type , and differences between the mutant and wild type in both y and electron transport rate  increased with increasing photosynthetically active radiation  . as y provides the effective quantum yield and could be used to estimate the effective portion of absorbed quanta; while etr provides information for plant stress reaction, so the results indicates that mutation of tassivb-d leads to a decrease in relative quantum yield and has a negative effect on psii efficiency.table  <dig> changes in chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in the tassivb-d e054- <dig> nonsense mutant at the heading stage

discussion
conserved and functional regions of tassivb
as one of the isoforms of the soluble starch synthesis family, wheat ssiv contains the starch catalytic domain  and glycosyltranferase domain . gt- <dig>  is more conserved than gt- <dig>  between ss isoforms  <cit> . two mutations that we identified in this study, e <dig> and e <dig>  are located in gt- <dig> and gt- <dig>  respectively, and in the wild type these amino acids are involved in the formation of β-sheets . in contrast the n-terminus  is distinct from other ss isoforms, and this region contains two coiled-coil domains and a 14-3-3-protein binding site  <cit> . the missense mutation e2-2- <dig> and the truncation mutation e054- <dig> are located in this region. these novel alleles could be very useful in understanding the specific functions of ssiv in starch granule synthesis in wheat. the gene expression patterns and alteration of granule number in the e <dig> and e054- <dig> mutants demonstrate the important roles of these predicted functional regions. the e054- <dig> truncation mutation has a more severe effect than the missense mutation; tassivb gene expression is reduced by 5 ~ 13-fold compared with e <dig> , and granule number is also significantly decreased compared with e <dig> .

expression of tassivb homoeologs
wheat has three sub-genomes, and the literature shows that the contribution of each homeologous gene can be different. for example, of the three ssiia genes, ssiia on the b genome has the largest contribution to amylopectin structure than those on the other two genomes  <cit> . each waxy gene encoding gbssi has different effects on amylopecitin characteristics  <cit> . ss isoform ssiv is encoded by three homeologous genes located on group i chromosomes  <cit>  and the effect of each gene and their interactions is not clear. here we designed homeologous-specific primers to determine the gene expression patterns of the three ssiv genes. in tassivb-d mutants, decreased expression of tassivb-d did not result in significant changes in the expression of tassivb-a or tassivb-b. this is similar to what was observed in the single null mutant of sbeiia; a mutation in one sub-genome does not result in appreciably different expression in the other two sub-genomes  <cit> . however, the identification of mutations in tassivb-a and tassivb-b is needed to analyze the interaction between homoeologous copies or their dosage effects.

expression of tassiv-d in wheat leaves
the function of atssiv, which it is highly expressed in leaves in arabidopsis is very well understood. in wheat, the expression of tassivb is tissue-dependent, and is much more highly expressed in leaves than in the endosperm  <cit> . our results are consistent with these reports; all three homeologous genes are highly expressed in leaves during the entire growth period. there is also evidence that tassivb is expressed during seed development . in ongoing research we are investigating the accumulation of storage starch in both the e054- <dig> and e <dig> mutants to elucidate the role of tassivb in storage starch synthesis.

starch granule synthesis
starch granules are initiated early in the development of young leaves in arabidopsis. because more starch granules are observed in immature leaves than in mature leaves  <cit> , it is believed that ssiv functions in granule initiation at earlier growth periods  <cit> . the ssiv mutant in arabidopsis has reduced granules in most chloroplasts  <cit> . the results of this study demonstrate that in young wheat leaves tassiv-d has a function similar to atssiv, and it is involved in initiation of transitory starch synthesis. at the seedling stage, the expression patterns of both the e054- <dig> and e <dig> tassiv-d mutants are down regulated. in the e <dig> mutant, the significant reduction of granule number is only observed when the expression of tassiv-d is reduced; while in the nonsense mutant, starch granules are reduced at all the three stages. this indicates that reduction of starch granule number results from the mutation of tassiv-d and not other genes.

effect of homeologous genes
in many cases, homeologous genes from different sub-genomes of wheat have dosage effects on phenotypes. only double or triple mutants of ssiia have severe effects on starch properties  <cit> , and single-gene mutants do not show significant phenotypes  <cit> . however in single tassiv-d gene mutants, gene expression level, granule number, relative quantum yield and psii efficiency are significantly reduced with respect to the wild type. it has been reported that single mutants of the genes sbeiia and gpc  also show significant phenotypic differences compared with the wild type  <cit> , so not only double and triple mutants, but also single mutants can lead to phenotypic changes in hexaploid wheat.

relationship between transient starch content and photosynthesis
it has been reported that the capacity for starch synthesis and the rate of photosynthesis are positively correlated  <cit> . a starchless tobacco mutant shows about 50% inhibition of maximum photosynthetic capacity  <cit> . mutation of ssiv in arabidopsis also has negative effects on photosynthesis efficiency  <cit> . our ssiv mutant in wheat shows the same effects; photosynthesis efficiency is significantly reduced. this is likely because ssiv mutants accumulate high concentrations of the substrate adpglucose  <cit> , which leads to photooxidative stress and decreased photosynthesis efficiency  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified novel alleles, including missense and nonsense mutations, of the starch synthesis gene, tassivb-d. gene expression, granule number and photosynthetic parameters are down-regulated or reduced in the missense mutant e <dig> and the nonsense mutant e054- <dig>  and the impact of e054- <dig> is much more severe than that of e <dig>  this demonstrates tassivb-d plays an important role in the formation of transient starch granules in wheat, and mutation of tassivb-d results in remarkable reduction in transitory starch granules in leavies. the mutagenized population generated in this study could be used as a resource for gene functional research.
