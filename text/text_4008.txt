BACKGROUND
central to many concepts in evolutionary biology is the idea that adaptation is not cost-free  <cit> . costs arise if adaptation in one trait is opposed by a negative correlated response to another trait. such trade-offs between fitness components can influence life-history evolution, ecological specialisation and more generally, the maintenance of genetic diversity  <cit> .

costs of adaptation also play an important role in host-parasite coevolution. in the host, costs of resistance refer to trade-offs between resistance and other fitness-relevant traits, conferring a selective disadvantage to resistant genotypes in the absence of the parasite. the corresponding costs in the parasite, referred to as 'costs of virulence' in the plant-pathogen literature, are trade-offs between the capacity to establish an infection and other parasite characters . these costs are considered major ingredients of the coevolutionary process because they can prevent the spread to fixation of all-resistant host or all-infectious parasite genotypes and thereby preserve genetic diversity in both host and parasite populations  <cit> .

while costs of resistance have been investigated in various host-parasite systems bacteria:  <cit> ; protozoa:  <cit> ; drosophila:  <cit> ), still little is known about costs of virulence and their role in shaping genetic structure and coevolutionary dynamics. historically, this issue has first been addressed in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . here, virulence refers to the ability of the pathogen to circumvent host resistance and establish an infection. this ability often arises from mutational loss of function of genes that would otherwise elicit a defense reaction of the host  <cit> . however, this advantage of malfunctioning can turn into a disadvantage if these genes are essential for subsequent development of infection. with the advent of molecular techniques, investigation of the precise genetic and physiological basis of costs of virulence has become possible. induced mutagenesis of genes implicated in plant-pathogen recognition revealed that at least some of these genes are involved in within-host replication, pathogenicity or spore production  <cit> . thus, loss of function of these genes will allow infection, but also impose a straightforward cost for subsequent development.

given their intrinsic fitness costs, selection should eliminate unnecessary virulence genes from the pathogen population and favour pathotypes with particular virulence genes that match the resistance structure of the host population  <cit> . thus, in classical models of plant-pathogen coevolution, changes in the frequencies of resistance and virulence genes are essentially determined by the fitness trade-offs associated with these genes  <cit> . while more recent theoretical developments balance the importance of cost with other biological features  <cit> , empirical and experimental evidence of these basic theoretical concepts is still scant. natural populations of various pathogens often harbour genotypes carrying different numbers of virulence alleles. for pathogens of crop plants, withdrawal of a particular cultivar sometimes leads to the subsequent decrease in frequency of the genotypes carrying the corresponding virulence allele  <cit> , consistent with the idea of selection against unnecessary and costly virulence alleles. in some cases, molecular analysis suggests that costs of virulence contribute to the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in the pathogen  <cit> ; in yet other cases, elimination of the function of virulence genes seems to be cost-free, suggesting that fitness costs are not universal and depend on the gene or the pathogen considered.

only few experimental studies compared the relative fitness of naturally occurring pathogen genotypes that carry different numbers of virulence alleles. thrall and burdon  <cit>  detected a negative correlation between virulence and spore production for the plant pathogen melampsora lini. this trade-off may explain why relatively avirulent strains dominated susceptible host populations. furthermore, for different plant-pathogen systems, competition experiments compared pathogen genotypes with different numbers of virulence alleles. some of these studies demonstrated a selective advantage of simpler over complex genotypes, at least in the greenhouse . typically, however, these experiments did not control for the genetic background of the competing strains and it is possible that fitness differences were caused by other genes  <cit> .

here, we investigated costs of virulence in the yellow rust fungus, puccinia striiformis f.sp.tritici , one of the most damaging wheat pathogens worldwide  <cit> . this clonally reproducing pathogen rapidly evolves through stepwise mutational acquisition of new virulences  <cit> , and the resulting arms race between plant breeders and the pathogen is characterised by frequent and rapid resistance breakdowns  <cit> . in north-western europe, the fitness advantage of being able to grow on a resistant cultivar is so strong that a new virulent mutant pathotype can replace an existing dominant pathotype within 2– <dig> years  <cit> . costs of virulence potentially slow down resistance breakdowns or at least limit the severity of epidemics. therefore knowledge of these costs can help plant breeders to better understand evolutionary change in the pathogen and to develop more efficient strategies of resistance management.

we performed competition experiments using pathogen genotypes that differed by a single virulence gene not needed for infection. this is analogous to measuring costs of resistance in the absence of the parasite  <cit> . if the virulence gene is costly, its carriers should be at a competitive disadvantage. we tested this hypothesis for different naturally occurring virulence genes. the specific novelty of this study is that we explicitly accounted for genetic background by competing genotypes with identical  profiles of molecular markers . because this pathogen is clonal, identical profiles indicate very close phylogenetic relationships. further, competition assays were carried out both in the climatic chamber and in the field, on different wheat cultivars and in different years. we confront our results with changes in the frequencies of these virulence factors in natural populations over the past  <dig> years  <cit> , and with changes in aggressiveness in a collection of isolates from this period.

RESULTS
 <dig>  competition experiments
the  <dig> isolates used in these experiments were collected from naturally infected fields in france between  <dig> and  <dig>  competition experiments were carried out between pairs of fungal isolates with identical aflp marker profiles . these isolates also had identical virulence gene profiles, except that one of the two isolates carried one additional virulence gene . the isolate with the additional virulence gene will be referred to as 'virulent' , the one without it as 'avirulent' . by definition, virulent isolates are fully infective  on resistant plants, whereas avirulent isolates cannot infect these plants . remember that 'virulent' here is used in the plant pathology sense, i.e., it refers to the capacity to infect a host; to describe the damage done to the host, we use the term 'aggressiveness'  <cit> . in the present experiments, host varieties were chosen such that both types of isolates were infectious, that is, the additional virulence gene was redundant with respect to infectivity of the isolate and thus potentially costly. we tested the effects of three virulence genes vir <dig>  vir <dig> and vir <dig> in field experiments, with an additional focus on vir <dig> in controlled conditions.

three virulence factors  were tested, with  <dig> natural isolates  of p. striiformis f.sp. tritici. for each of the  <dig> pairs , the two competing isolates had  identical aflp profiles and identical virulence factor profiles, except for the virulence factor to be tested . the isolate carrying the additional virulence gene is referred to as virulent , the one without it as avirulent .  <dig> nomenclature determined by reactions on a set of european and world differential cultivars;  <dig> sd refers to virulence on the cultivar strubes dickkopf;  <dig> lab references of each isolate. the two numbers after the "j" denote year of sampling of the isolate.

vir <dig> pathotype
in a climate chamber assay, we competed two independent pairs  of a virulent and an avirulent isolate, initially in a 50: <dig> mix. for pair a, the relative frequency of the isolate  with the additional virulence allele decreased by 50% over the course of five infection cycles, and this on both host cultivars . for pair b, deviations from the 50: <dig> ratio were less pronounced and differed between host cultivars .

in field competition assays, the relative frequencies of avirulent and virulent isolates at the end of the growing season varied strongly among four independent pairs . starting from an initial 50: <dig> ratio, the relative frequency of the virulent isolate  in pair a decreased significantly by about 50%, just like in the greenhouse assay. in contrast, virulent isolates  doubled in frequency in the three other pairs . with one exception , these patterns were consistent over growing seasons  and host plant cultivars  . thus, in one case , the isolate with the additional virulence was less competitive than its isogenic counterpart; in the three other cases, it was more competitive . the selective advantage or disadvantage of these virulent isolates was in the order of 15–20%.

mean  frequencies  of virulent  isolates relative to avirulent  isolates, measured at the end of the growing season. different pairs  were set up for each of  <dig> virulence genes . each pair was started from an initial 50: <dig> ratio and competed on two host cultivars and in two field seasons . selective values of avir isolates were estimated according to leonard  <cit>  and represent averages over cultivars and years. *cultivar  <dig> correspond to cv. thésée for avir9/vir <dig> and cv. audace for avir4/vir <dig> and avir6/vir <dig>  respectively. ** cultivar  <dig> correspond to cv. récital for avir9/vir <dig> and cv. baltimore for avir4/vir <dig> and avir6/vir <dig>  respectively.

based on a logistic regression, analysis of deviance tested for effects of pair , host cultivar and year on final frequencies of vir <dig> isolates. analogous to analysis of variance, mean deviances  were used to calculate quasi-f values. the denominator  column indicates the error terms used for the f-tests; where necessary, linear combinations of different model factors were made  <cit> . the df column indicates the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. all factors were considered as random effects. model fitting was analogous to sas-type ii model fitting  <cit> .

with two additional competition pairs  we were able to compare all possible a vir/vir combinations between the i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig> and i <dig> isolates. analysis of this set of combinations  revealed a significant effect of virulence identity , but no significant interaction between avirulence and virulence identity . that is, the i <dig> isolate was less competitive and the i <dig> more competitive, regardless of the identity of the avirulent counterpart in the mix.

vir <dig> and vir <dig> pathotypes
for the vir <dig> and vir <dig> pathotypes, four pairs of avirulent and virulent isolates were tested  under field conditions. for all virulent isolates, we observed a significant decrease in the frequency  . typically, their relative frequencies dropped from initially 50% to around 20–30% within a growing season, although this effect varied to some extent between years  and host cultivars . thus, in all four pairs tested, the isolate with the additional virulence was substantially less competitive, with a selective disadvantage of 17–24%.

 <dig>  sporulation test and genetic analysis of the vir <dig> pathotype
we further investigated temporal changes in the genetic composition of the french population for the vir <dig> pathotype. to this end, we characterised aflp profiles and measured aggressiveness of  <dig> vir <dig> isolates collected between  <dig> and  <dig>  despite thorough screening of  <dig> primer combinations, no variation in the neutral markers was detected, indicating that these isolates all belonged to the same clonal line of descent. in contrast, isolates differed significantly in their aggressiveness, as measured by the infection type  index . this visual classification index was highly correlated with quantitative measurements of sporulation rate , showing an up to 5-fold difference in sporulation rate between isolates. after the resistance breakdown of the yr <dig> cultivar in  <dig>  a first epidemic occurred between  <dig> and  <dig>  a second between  <dig> and  <dig>  in the collection, the variance in it significantly decreased between the first and the second epidemic period , with a concomitant 9% increase in the mean it index. we found a considerably higher frequency of heavily sporulating isolates  during the second epidemic  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; figure 3). these changes suggest a response to natural selection in aggressiveness during the two epidemics. finally, note the link between performance in the competition assays and sporulation rate: the less competitive i <dig> isolate had a much lower sporulation rate  than the three more competitive isolates .

discussion
evidence for costs of virulence
for five of the  <dig> virulent isolates tested, our experiments demonstrated a substantial cost of carrying an additional virulence gene, and this for different genes and different genetic backgrounds of the same gene. despite some variation between years and cultivars, these costs appear to be quite robust and repeatable. in particular, the additional tests  showed that the low performance of the virulent isolates was independent of the identity of the avirulent competitor.

genetic variation in fitness detected in the laboratory does not always reflect the degree of variation expressed under field conditions. under natural conditions, stress can increase the genetic variance in fitness  <cit> , while confounding environmental effects might limit its detection  <cit> . here, the field assays revealed even stronger fitness differences between the competing isolates . the selection coefficients  are similar to those from laboratory studies on other organisms  <cit>  and indicate potentially strong selection against these virulence genes, if redundant. the most likely cause of this competitive disadvantage is a reduction in the ability to develop on the host and produce spores. this type of cost has been detected in other pathogens  <cit>  and at least for the vir <dig> virulence gene, we have direct evidence that costs are due to low sporulation.

compatibility with epidemiological history of natural pst populations
in agricultural host-parasite arms races, farmers typically plant one or a few host cultivars over large geographic areas. this imposes strong, uniform selection on the pathogen to evolve the ability to attack these host genotypes. in the case of pst, the necessary virulence genes to overcome resistance can rapidly arise through mutation in large clonal populations. once a resistance breakdown has occurred, cultivars are withdrawn and replaced by new resistant cultivars, developed by plant breeders. indeed, one of the to date most convincing examples of such a semi-natural coevolutionary arms race has been demonstrated for the pst-wheat system  <cit> , and it involves the virulence genes  studied in our experiments. with the replacement of susceptible cultivars, the vir <dig> and vir <dig> genes have become redundant at some point during the past  <dig> years . thus, if these genes impose fitness costs, they should have decreased in frequency in natural pathogen populations <cit> .

for the vir <dig> virulence gene, this seems to be the case. the competition experiment revealed a strong selective disadvantage of the virulent vir <dig> isolates, and this is consistent with three declines in the frequency of the vir <dig> gene, when cultivars carrying the corresponding resistance gene  were retracted  <cit> . in contrast, the fitness costs of the vir <dig> virulence gene detected in the competition experiment does not match with its epidemiological history. the vir <dig> gene appeared in europe already more than  <dig> years ago <cit>  and all contemporary pathotypes carry it. interestingly, the majority of plant varieties used in france in the past  <dig> years did not carry the corresponding yr <dig> resistance gene and thus the vir <dig> gene must have been mostly redundant. given the clonal evolution of pst, it is possible that this ancestral vir <dig> gene has spread to fixation by hitch-hiking with new, selectively advantageous virulence genes. originally, the vir <dig> gene may have immigrated from the uk, where the yr <dig> resistance gene was present in several cultivars in the past . in fact, the yr <dig> has also been postulated for certain danish wheat cultivars  <cit> . this suggests that the vir <dig> gene may even have a selective advantage at a larger, european scale and that simple hitch-hiking is not the only explanation for its presence in the french population. it further implies that migration at larger geographical scales, such as that between the uk and continental europe  <cit> , can influence local pathogen population structure and evolution.

for the vir <dig> gene, the story is more complex. after the resistance breakdowns in  <dig> and  <dig> and subsequent withdrawal of the susceptible cultivars, vir <dig> did not decrease in frequency, and currently all known pst pathotypes are fixed for this redundant virulence gene  <cit> . in part, this can be explained by its hitch-hiking with a newly arisen virulence gene , just like in the case of the vir <dig> gene. moreover, we detected a fitness cost only for one vir <dig> isolate, while the other three isolates were even more competitive than their avirulent counterparts not carrying the vir <dig> gene. our results further indicate that these differences are due to variation in aggressiveness and sporulation rates. the three successful isolates sporulate at high rates, while the less competitive one is among the least aggressive isolates of the vir <dig> collection.

why is the vir <dig> gene costly in some isolates, but not in others? the answer may lie either in the gene itself or in its genetic background. first, in our four virulent isolates, the same vir <dig> virulence phenotype may represent different mutations, and only one imposes a fitness cost. typically, virulence genes arise from mutations disrupting some metabolic function that would otherwise elicit a resistance reaction. it is conceivable that different mutations can bring about such modifications, and possibly not all of them come at a fitness cost  <cit> . alternatively, costs of virulence may have been balanced by compensatory mutations. compensation may occur directly in the gene responsable for the loss of function, but also indirectly in genes determining pathogen aggressiveness. indeed, aggressiveness is known to have a multigenic basis  <cit> , thus offering multiple targets for compensatory mutations. if fitness effects are sufficiently large and selection efficient, this may even bring about a net positive effect and overcompensation of the cost of virulence. the history of the vir <dig> gene is compatible with such a scenario. resistance breakdown of the yr <dig> gene in england occurred already two years before highly aggressive vir <dig> variants appeared in france. breakdowns are usually accompanied by massive pst epidemics, with exponential population growth and up to  <dig> infection cycles per growing season. this may have provided sufficient time for compensatory mutations to arise in the vir <dig> background and to be picked up by natural selection. indeed, for the period in question, a signature of this process can be seen by the increase of the frequency of highly aggressive isolates in the vir <dig> spore collection. so far, cost-compensation has been described for resistance to antibiotics <cit>  or insecticides  <cit> . if our interpretations are correct, this study is one of the first to suggest the compensation of costs of virulence in natural populations of a pathogen. similar ideas about the progressive evolution of the fitness of new pathotypes of cereal rusts date back to the 1970s. based on empirical and experimental data, it was suggested that new phenotypes were unable to spread because of their low aggressiveness  <cit>  and that adaptation to quantitative host resistance occurred gradually through polygenic changes  <cit> .

interestingly, we did not detect variation in neutral genetic markers among the isolates in the collection, despite the large number of primer combinations screened. as these isolates share the same clonal background, variation in both virulence and aggressiveness must have arisen within a relatively short time span. indeed, lande and barrowclough  <cit>  showed that in very large populations, heritable variation in quantitative traits can established by spontaneous mutation without leaving a trace in neutral genetic markers. clearly, this rapid evolutionary change sets limits to our "all-else-being-equal" approach in the competition experiments, aiming at the comparison of isogenic isolates that differ only in the virulence gene in question.

CONCLUSIONS
first, our study demonstrates substantial fitness costs of single virulence genes on different host varieties under field conditions. in part, these costs explain changes in the genetic composition of natural pst populations, consistent with van der plank's hypothesis of selection against redundant virulence genes  <cit> . second, however, we also found that redundant virulence genes are not automatically selected against, either because they do not have a fitness cost or because costs are compensated. regardless of the precise mechanism, one of our main conclusions is that the fate of a particular virulence mutation may not be independent of its genetic background. this is particularly relevant for clonal pathogens, such as pst, where the whole genome is a single linkage group exposed to natural selection. selection then perceives the sum of the costs of the different virulence genes carried by a given genotype and that of all other genes determining growth and transmission. indeed, additional virulences may have more deleterious effects in genetic backgrounds that already carry other virulence genes  <cit>  as it was the case in our study. the very different outcomes for the three virulence genes studied here indicate strong variation in the evolutionary trajectories of virulence mutations; this also stresses the need for more refined theoretical models to predict these trajectories.

third, our results have implications for plant breeding strategies. current large-scale programs employ inter-specific crosses and molecular engineering to develop resistance genes imposing a high cost of virulence for pathogens that overcome this resistance. this handicap may prevent the spread of such pathogen genotypes and thus increase the durability of resistance  <cit> . obviously, this approach critically hinges on the consistency and durability of costs of virulence. our experiments indicate that costs can be quite consistent, at least for certain virulence genes. however, durability of costs of virulence can be expected to be inversely proportional to the strength of selection imposed on the pathogen to compensate these costs. we suspect that that compensation may occur rather rapidly, by hitch-hiking processes or by efficient selection on multigenic traits. thus, if demonstrating the cost of virulence is already complicated, predicting its durability may be even more difficult.

finally, it is often argued that agro-patho-systems are too artificial or too simple to be comparable to natural host-parasite systems. here, we demonstrated that the seemingly straightforward genetic architecture of the cultivated host produces complex patterns of genetic change in its natural opponent. these evolutionary changes can be investigated experimentally in real-time  and they remain traceable over larger time scales in the production areas . we therefore believe that the study of these systems can provide valuable general insights in the costs and consequences of adaptation in host-parasite systems.
