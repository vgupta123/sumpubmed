BACKGROUND
ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women, with epithelial ovarian carcinomas being the most prevalent type diagnosed  <cit> . chemoresistance, a common development in ovarian carcinomas, is a major hurdle that significantly hinders treatment success  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that the dysregulation of pro-apoptotic genes is a key factor for the onset and maintenance of chemoresistance  <cit> . one of such pro-apoptotic gene families is the secreted frizzled-related protein  family, an antagonist of the wnt signalling pathway. sfrps have a shared homology with frizzled receptors and are thought to be able to impede wnt-fz interactions, thereby blocking wnt activity in cells. wnts have been established to play essential roles during foetal development  <cit>  as well as maintaining homeostasis in adult tissues  <cit> . however, aberrant canonical wnt signalling has been widely described in cancer and has been implicated as an important contributor to tumour development  <cit> . several studies have reported a correlation between up-regulation of sfrp expression, in particular that of sfrp <dig>  and apoptosis in various tissues  <cit> . the over-expression of sfrps has been shown to decrease β-catenin levels within the cells, thus increasing their susceptibility to pro-apoptotic stimuli  <cit> . while restoration or up-regulation of sfrp expression in cancer cells was shown to attenuate their tumourigenic behaviour by inhibiting wnt signalling and inducing apoptosis  <cit> , hypermethylated silencing of sfrp genes tended to increase with tumour progression and invasiveness  <cit> .

in this study we investigated the effects of over-expressing or silencing of sfrp <dig> in ovarian cancer lines with different chemosensitivity in an in vitro model. we further examined sfrp <dig> expression in human ovarian tumours to assess if its expression could be correlated with clinico-pathological features consistent with a proposed role for loss being a contributor to chemoresistance.

RESULTS
differential expression of sfrp isoforms in ovarian cancer cell lines
the expression profiles of all  <dig> isoforms of sfrp were determined in the four cell lines used in this study. sfrp <dig> was not detected in any of the cell lines , and only sfrp <dig> was differentially expressed between the chemosensitive  and chemoresistant cancer cell lines ; with a <dig> expressing significantly higher mrna levels of sfrp <dig> in comparison to the a2780-adr and a2780-cis . western blot analysis of sfrp <dig> protein levels determined that the normal cell line iose expressed significantly higher levels of sfrp <dig>  compared to the cancer cells. furthermore, the chemosensitive a <dig> cells also exhibited significantly higher levels of sfrp <dig>  compared to the chemoresistant cell lines . a representative image of the western blot is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

sfrp <dig> expressing cells are selectively killed by cisplatin
analysis of mts cell viability assays following cisplatin treatment demonstrated that both the iose and a <dig> cells, which were shown to express more sfrp <dig>  had a significant reduction  in cell viability compared to untreated controls within  <dig> h for all three treatment doses administered, and continued to exhibit decreased viability for the remaining time points . the chemoresistant cell lines continued to proliferate, but a significant reduction in cell viability was shown at  <dig> h after treatment .

following cisplatin treatment, only iose cells demonstrated significant mitochondrial membrane depolarization in all treatment groups within  <dig> h after treatment. although the chemosensitive cell line a <dig> demonstrated decreased cell viability in all three treatment groups, cell death was detected only at the treatment dose of  <dig> μg/ml. in contrast, cell death was detected in the chemoresistant cell lines only after  <dig> h treatment  , suggesting that their lower sfrp <dig> levels could potentially be one of the factors influencing the delayed response of these cells.

ihc revealed that sfrp <dig> expression could not be detected in the majority of surviving cells. compared to untreated controls, the percentage of iose cells still expressing sfrp <dig> had decreased by 70% following treatment with cisplatin  for  <dig> h . similarly, the chemosensitive cell line a <dig> also demonstrated a reduction of about 45% of its sfrp <dig> expressing cell population following treatment. in comparison, the chemoresistant cell lines demonstrated a greater percentage of live cells following treatment and only showed a reduction of 25% in the number of cells expressing sfrp <dig>  additionally, the difference in numbers of sfrp <dig> expressing cells between chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines was highly significant  .

over expression of sfrp <dig> enhanced chemosensitivity of tumour cells
since chemotherapy appeared to be selectively killing sfrp <dig> expressing cells, we sought to test this relationship further by transfecting the chemoresistant cell lines with a plasmid expressing sfrp <dig> before treating them with cisplatin. results showed that increasing sfrp <dig> expression of the chemoresistant cell lines a2780-adr and a2780-cis  before treatment with cisplatin for  <dig> h resulted in a highly significant decrease in cell viability  compared to control groups .

down regulation of sfrp <dig> decreased chemosensitivity of tumour cells
data generated from cell viability and cell death assays showed an inverse relationship between sfrp <dig> expression and the response of tumour cells to cisplatin treatment. to further investigate this correlation, the sfrp <dig> expression levels of the chemosensitive cell line a <dig> was knocked down using sirna. the a <dig> cells treated with sfrp4-sirna demonstrated a 40% decrease in sfrp <dig> mrna and protein expression compared to control cells . results showed that the control group subjected to cisplatin treatment exhibited a 60% reduction in cell viability compared to untreated controls. however, the cells subjected to sfrp4-sirna treatment only exhibited a 40% reduction in cell viability following treatment with cisplatin compared to control cells . the relative increase in cell viability of cisplatin treated sfrp4-sirna cells indicates that decreasing sfrp <dig> in chemosensitive cells caused more resistance to cisplatin.

differential sfrp <dig> expression was correlated to its interaction with the wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway
western blot analysis for β-catenin protein showed that in contrast to sfrp <dig>  all three cell lines exhibited elevated levels of β-catenin, indicating the presence of an active wnt pathway . although the un-transfected chemoresistant cell lines showed relatively high β-catenin expression, this expression could not be detected in the sfrp4-transfected cells. additionally, the 40% decrease of sfrp <dig> expression in chemosensitive a <dig> cells due to silencing was accompanied by a corresponding increase in β-catenin expression , confirming a functional relationship between sfrp <dig> and the wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in this cell line.

association of sfrp <dig> and stage in primary mucinous ovarian tumours
we performed sfrp <dig>  and β-catenin ihc on primary mucinous ovarian cancer biopsies in tissue microarrays  comprising  <dig> primary mucinous ovarian tumours. the tma sections were subjectively classified into one of four categories depending on the percentage and intensity of the cellular sfrp <dig> staining: negative, weak, moderate or strong . the primary mucinous ovarian tumours were classified into three sub-types; namely benign, borderline, and adenocarcinomas, and the proportion of sfrp <dig> and β-catenin was quantified for each . analysis revealed that the majority of benign and borderline tumours exhibited sfrp <dig> expression, while adenocarcinomas demonstrated a significantly reduced sfrp <dig> expression compared to borderline and benign tumours  . an inverse trend was observed for β-catenin, with benign tumours expressing significantly decreased levels of β-catenin compared to the corresponding sfrp <dig> expression . although borderline tumours also showed decreased β-catenin expression compared to sfrp <dig>  this was not significant. in contrast to their sfrp <dig> expression, adenocarcinomas expressed significantly higher levels of β-catenin, indicating an inverse relationship between β-catenin and sfrp <dig> expression in benign and malignant mucinous tumours. furthermore, results also demonstrated a positive trend between sfrp <dig> expression and tumour grade.

discussion
although the rate of cancer incidence is greater in the breast than the ovaries, the latter has a higher relative mortality. this is because ovarian tumours are often diagnosed at an advanced stage. in addition, a majority of tumours that are initially responsive to chemotherapy eventually acquire drug-resistance to these therapeutic agents  <cit> . comprehending how this drug resistance occurs is the basis for developing strategies to improve treatment outcomes.

in this study, the five sfrp isoforms were characterized for the first time in a range of chemosensitive and chemoresistant human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines. similar to other tumour types, several of the sfrp isoforms were detected in ovarian cancer cells. however, sfrp <dig> was the dominant isoform in all the cell lines tested. sfrp <dig> was first isolated from the ovary and it is probable that it may have specificity for this organ  <cit> ; hence, its dominant expression could be indicative of a specific functional role in the ovary. similarly, sfrp <dig> mrna was the only isoform to be differentially expressed between the different cell lines. western blots and ihc for sfrp <dig> protein also confirmed that the chemoresistant cells expressed lower levels of this protein. the differential expression of sfrp <dig> seen in the chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines indicated that sfrp <dig> could serve as a prognostic marker for ovarian tumours.

ihc showed heterogeneous expression of sfrp <dig> in the various ovarian cell populations examined, in contrast to the pattern of expression in the normal iose cells, which was homogenous. the chemosensitive cell line was found to exhibit a larger sub-population of sfrp <dig> positive cells than the chemoresistant cells. it is known that ovarian tumours have a heterogeneous population of cells. therefore it is very likely that the cells have a differential response to chemotherapeutic treatment  <cit> . our results indicated that the heterogeneity of sfrp <dig> expression was correlated with the response of the cell lines to cisplatin, with sfrp <dig> expression as a positive marker for chemosensitivity.

furthermore, ihc of the cancerous cell lines following treatment with cisplatin revealed that, compared to untreated controls, both the chemosensitive cell line a <dig> and the chemoresistant cell lines lost most of their sfrp <dig> expressing cells; indicating that cisplatin selectively targets sfrp <dig> expressing cells within the heterogeneous population.

increasing the sfrp <dig> expression of the chemoresistant cell lines using transfection prior to cisplatin treatment resulted in more cells expressing sfrp <dig> and, as predicted, increased their sensitivity to treatment. in contrast, knocking down sfrp <dig> expression of the chemosensitive a <dig> cells by 40% was sufficient to confer these cells with partial resistance to subsequent chemotherapeutic treatment when compared to controls. these results are comparable with a study by he et al., , who reported that significant down regulation of sfrp <dig> expression promoted cell growth and inhibited chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in mesothelioma cell lines  <cit> . our transfection and silencing experiments confirmed that sfrp <dig> appeared to have a direct influence on the chemo-response of cancer cells. the data generated from this study present a novel finding and indicate a potential avenue for future research on sfrp <dig> 

the heterogeneous expression of sfrp <dig> we observed using ihc in our cell lines indicated the presence of at least two sub-populations within ovarian cell cultures. the chemosensitive cells had a larger population of sfrp <dig> positive cells, and this correlated with their greater sensitivity to treatment. hypermethylation of the sfrp <dig> gene has been reported in various cancers and is associated with tumour progression and malignancy  <cit> . we did not examine our ovarian cancer cell lines on whether low sfrp <dig> expression was associated with hypermethylation of the sfrp <dig> gene itself, and this would be useful to know.

our experiments raised some possible explanations for acquired resistance to cisplatin in human ovarian cancers. from our ihc analysis we know that cisplatin selectively targets sfrp <dig> expressing cells, thus continuous treatment would gradually deplete this sub-population of cells over time. consequently, the resultant population remaining would now be comprised largely of cells that do not express sfrp <dig> and, hence, be more resistant to subsequent treatment. these data suggest that loss of sfrp <dig> expression is functionally associated with a more malignant and chemoresistant phenotype, and that treatment itself may select for these cells, thereby resulting in acquired chemoresistance.

suppression of sfrp <dig> in the chemosensitive cells resulted in a corresponding increase in β-catenin expression of these cells. this study confirmed the existence of an inverse relationship between sfrp <dig> and β-catenin expression, and the presence of a signalling interaction between these two proteins in the ovarian cell lines. these findings are consistent with other studies that also reported a similar inverse relationship between these two proteins in endometrium and breast  <cit> , and suggests that sfrp <dig> may act as a tumour suppressor through its interaction with the wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway by modulating the cellular cytosolic β-catenin pool.

mucinous tumours, unlike other ovarian epithelial sub-types, have a well characterised progression from benign to borderline and ultimately to adenocarcinomas  <cit> . in addition, mucinous adenocarcinomas, compared to other subtypes, respond poorly to chemotherapy and are known to have a poor prognosis  <cit> . similar to our data, a trend has been observed by other studies where down regulation of sfrp <dig> expression was similarly associated with stage and grade of the cancer  <cit> . these results suggest that the progressive decline of sfrp <dig> expression in higher grade disease states could be associated with both tumour progression as well as onset of chemoresistance. however, due to our relatively low patient cohort size, this trend needs to be assessed independently in larger patient numbers to further validate the significance of this finding.

CONCLUSIONS
studies have shown that targeting factors that regulate drug induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or inhibit angiogenesis can influence chemosensitivity  <cit> . our data are the first to demonstrate that sfrp <dig> not only plays a key role in the chemo-response of ovarian tumours but can enable these cells to respond better to cisplatin treatment when up-regulated in chemoresistant cells. another advantage of sfrp <dig> is that this molecule can suppress tumourigenic growth either in the presence or absence of the canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway, as demonstrated in mesothelioma cell lines by lee et al.  and he et al.  respectively  <cit> .

thus, the results from this study indicate a role for sfrp <dig> as a predictive marker for ovarian cancer cell chemosensitivity, and suggest that targeting the sfrp <dig> mediated pathway may be worth pursuing as a novel therapeutic target.
