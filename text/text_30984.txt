BACKGROUND
in the fossil record of marine and terrestrial taxa, the cretaceous period ) is usually considered a time of major reorganization and modernization of ecosystems characterized by the extinction of groups that were formerly dominant and the appearance and subsequent diversification of new groups  <cit> . the climate during this period is often considered a textbook example of a greenhouse world  <cit>  because of the high average global temperatures that lasted until about  <dig> ma. still, this period had its share of both warming and cooling events, and was notably characterized by an extensive tropical ecosystem  <cit>  and an important reduction of arid zones that started about 110– <dig> ma  <cit> . of particular interest, a period called the cretaceous terrestrial revolution , saw the explosive radiation of angiosperms which rose from  <dig> to 80% of floral composition between 125– <dig> ma  <cit> . the ktr likely provided new ecological and evolutionary opportunities for insects  <cit>  and for several vertebrate clades that underwent major diversification during this period  <cit> . although it remains challenging to investigate the diversification dynamics of species-rich groups in deep time, ancient clades represent important avenues to assess the impacts of past environmental changes such as those we now face . however, the picture from the fossil record is incomplete and biased for most species-rich groups such as insects  <cit> . thankfully, recent developments of cutting-edge methods that allow estimation of variation in diversification rates among lineages  <cit>  provide new tools for assessing the diversification dynamics of groups with a poor fossil record. however, very few studies have addressed the effects of cretaceous environmental changes, in particular the ktr and the cretaceous-palaeogene  mass extinction, using these new methods . in birds and mammals an increase of diversification rates was revealed, which can be accounted for by high speciation and low extinction rates  <cit> . in contrast, the diversification rates in dinosaurs remained constant through the ktr  <cit> .

in insects, the explosive radiation of angiosperms is thought to have provided diversification opportunities for pollinators, leaf-mining flies, as well as butterflies and moths  <cit> . though numerous dated phylogenies are available, little information can be gleaned on the diversification dynamics of most major groups or families during the mesozoic. the most notable exceptions are a study on lepidoptera  <cit> , which highlighted three increases in diversification rates during the cretaceous; several studies on ants  <cit>  that revealed several diversification bursts about  <dig> ma; and a study on carpenter bees  <cit> , which provided support for a k-pg mass extinction event. in coleoptera, hunt et al.  <cit>  also postulated that the diversification of coleoptera is better explained by the persistence of old lineages  that diversified in multiple niches, rather than high diversification rates or the effect of the cretaceous rise of angiosperms. that said, at the time this study was conducted, methods that explicitly incorporate birth-death models allowing diversification rates to vary were not widely available, requiring authors to rely instead on sister-clade comparisons.

to provide novel insights on insect diversification dynamics, and especially on insect groups that do not feed on live plant tissues, we investigated how cretaceous changes impacted the diversification of a hyperdiverse beetle family, the tenebrionidae . this family currently encompasses ca.  <dig>  described species worldwide, and ranks seventh in terms of species richness within the coleoptera  <cit> . adults and larvae are mostly saprophagous, feeding on decaying vegetation, but some species are also mycetophagous and predatory larvae are known in a few tribes  <cit> . most of the extant tenebrionid species are either distributed in arid/semiarid regions  or in subtropical/tropical forested regions  <cit> . the habitat preference is so marked in this family that shifts in their abundance and range have been used as indicators of climate change  <cit> . the tenebrionid fossil record highlights an age as old as the middle jurassic for the family  <cit> , and indicates that mesozoic pangaean and gondwanan breakups may be reflected in the disjunct distribution patterns observed in several groups such as the pimeliinae or the adeliini  <cit> . however, due to its relative scarcity, the fossil record alone is not sufficient to provide an accurate temporal framework for the family.

to gain a better understanding of the age of specific divergence events, we conducted molecular dating analyses using  <dig> calibration points combined with conservative priors and calibration settings. we then used the resulting timeframe to conduct diversification analyses to investigate the early tempo and mode of diversification of the family in relation to cretaceous environmental changes. postulating that past environmental changes may have contributed to the diversification dynamics of tenebrionidae, as more than half of extant species are adapted to arid/semi-arid conditions, we also assessed whether the rise of angiosperms also coincided with changes in the diversification dynamics of clades that encompass forest-dwelling groups.

RESULTS
mesozoic origin and diversification of a species-rich beetle family
dating analyses unequivocally support an ancient origin for tenebrionidae at the end of the early jurassic , which significantly predates  previous molecular estimates of tenebrionid ages  <cit> . this earlier date of origin has several consequences on our understanding of tenebrionid origin and evolution against the backdrop of past environmental changes. the first lineages to diversify were a major clade of the paraphyletic subfamily pimeliinae  and the lagriinae . for these two groups, extant distribution patterns are consistent with potential vicariance events, as advocated for adeliini , which occur today in australia, chile, new caledonia and new zealand  <cit> . for pimeliinae, our results support the hypothesis of matthews et al.  <cit> , who postulated that the highly disjunct extant distributions of several pimeliine tribes are better explained by an ancient origin and gondwanan fragmentation. the diversification of these two subfamilies was followed by other subfamilies during the ktr , such as alleculinae , stenochiinae  and several lineages of diaperinae and tenebrioninae.figure  <dig>

contrary to the arid-dwelling pimeliinae, the other subfamilies are currently more diverse in tropical environments . thus if we consider that phylogenetic biome conservatism holds in many groups  <cit> , this suggests that distinct tenebrionid lineages were already adapted to arid or tropical environments before the end of the ktr. results from character optimization analyses support this hypothesis and suggest that the common ancestor of tenebrionid beetles was adapted to arid environments . arid environments were extremely widespread in the early jurassic  <cit> ; though they progressively receded with the break-up of the pangaea  <cit> , they never completely disappeared, which could explain the persistence of distinct lineages of pimeliine beetles across eastern and western hemispheres  <cit> . interestingly, pimeliine beetles are currently nearly absent from australia, where aridification began in the miocene and deserts only appeared very recently  <cit> . as underlined by matthews et al.  <cit> , this suggests that the group was strictly adapted to arid environments from the beginning, and unable to colonize the australian continent before its isolation in the middle of the cenozoic. the only exceptions are the few representatives  of two plesiotypic tribes  that were possibly present as coastal sand dune inhabitants before separation from gondwana  <cit> . other groups such as the rain-forest specialists adeliini  <cit>  originated about  <dig> ma , possibly in the warm temperate forests that were widespread in the southern hemisphere at that time  <cit> . this is also the case for other tropical groups in the subfamily tenebrioninae , whose most recent common ancestor diversified at the beginning of the late cretaceous, around  <dig> ma . in some of these groups the phylogenetic biome conservatism is not irreversible, highlighted by the results of character optimizations indicating that several lineages  became secondarily adapted to arid environments. these secondary shifts likely occurred multiple times during the evolutionary history of darkling beetles, as several subfamilies encompass xerophilic tribes .figure  <dig>

impacts of cretaceous environmental changes on tenebrionid diversification dynamics
the lineages-through-time plots suggested a rapid initial diversification, followed by a slowdown in the accumulation of lineages around 100– <dig> ma . similar to meredith et al.  <cit> , we used birth-death models, implemented in the treepar approach, to analyse the time-calibrated trees for the time period spanning  <dig> ma to the origin of the group . we found that a diversification model with varying rates through time was supported by both likelihood ratio tests  and corrected akaike information criteria compared to a constant birth-death model . the model with one shift time  fit the trees better . similar trends were also obtained using randomly sampled trees from the posterior trees of the bayesian dating analysis with the best-fit calibration procedure .figure  <dig>

both analyses support the same model of diversification , which is underlined by bold characters.



the period when diversification  and turnovers  changed was inferred to have been the boundary between the early and late cretaceous in the middle of the ktr . we found that from the origin of the family to about  <dig> ma, the net diversification rates of tenebrionid beetles  were more elevated than the average net diversification rates for all coleopterans estimated in hunt et al.  <cit>  . turnovers were not elevated before the shift time . when calculating speciation and extinction using the diversification rate and turnover ratio, the speciation rate was  <dig>  events/lineages myr− <dig> and the extinction rate was  <dig>  events/lineages myr− <dig> before the shift time .

after the shift time , turnover rates reached high levels  while net diversification rates dropped drastically . this important slowdown of net diversification rates  resulted from a marked increase of extinction rates , which was not compensated by a concurrent increase in speciation rates . thus, we found no support for a positive upturn in diversification rates during the ktr, contrary to the patterns observed for the diversification of lepidoptera  <cit> , ants  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , and birds  <cit> . this result suggests that the changes in floral communities concomitant with the radiation of angiosperms  <cit>  did not significantly foster the diversification of darkling beetles, a pattern in agreement with those observed in several other groups such as dinosaurs  <cit>  and flies  <cit> . it is worth highlighting that the decrease of net diversification rates we revealed cannot be attributed to the incompleteness of our sampling, because we would not have otherwise been able to capture the simultaneous increase of speciation rates at that time.

to better understand the potential contribution of major abiotic and biotic factors, we provide an overview of the possible correlates of diversification for tenebrionids on a global scale . our results allow us to rule out any role of the k-pg event on the significant increase in extinction rates, as it postdates the shift of diversification rates by about  <dig> myr. on the contrary, we postulate that the drastic reduction of arid habitats that started at the end of the early cretaceous specifically impacted the diversification of arid-specialist darkling beetles. in particular the subfamily pimeliinae, currently the single most speciose tenebrionid subfamily, is very conspicuous in desert ecosystems and is found sister to all other tenebrionids, which likely indicates that pimeliines were also predominant during the long-lasting arid episode that persisted between the late jurassic and the early cretaceous. therefore the shift toward humid conditions ca. 110– <dig> ma and the contractions of desert ecosystems  probably precipitated the extinction of multiple pimeliine lineages, leaving behind relict lineages with completely disjunct distributions. at least five instances of the latter are known  <cit>  for tribes caenocrypticini , cossyphodini , evaniosomini , elenophorini  and vacronini . it is also important to underline that the vast majority of pimeliinae are flightless  <cit> ; reduced dispersal abilities may have increased their sensitivity to the overall reduction of available habitats at a broader scale  <cit> , limiting their ability to track climate change  <cit> . while rapid habitat loss may have accelerated the extinction rate of this family dominated at the time by arid-adapted species, one could also imagine that their low vagility may have promoted the speciation of geographically isolated relictual populations through reduced migration between populations at a more local scale  <cit> .

we may hypothesize that high environmental temperatures during the jurassic and cretaceous increased rates of biological processes, shortening generation time and thus possibly increasing evolutionary speed  <cit> , leading to relatively high speciation rates. this role of temperature as a key driver of biodiversity is widely acknowledged for large-scale studies in both marine and terrestrial groups  <cit> . as tenebrionid beetles are more adapted to arid or tropical regions  <cit> , they may have benefited overall from the favourable warm climatic conditions that persisted during most of the ktr. after the inferred shift time, the concomitant increase in speciation rate can be attributed to the tropical-adapted lineages. these groups probably took advantage of the expansion of warm tropical and subtropical-forested biomes between the early and the late cretaceous  <cit> , which likely provided them with new ecological opportunities. this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that major tropical groups started their diversification shortly before  or after  the inferred time of environmental shift.

CONCLUSIONS
overall the global diversification pattern that was inferred for tenebrionid beetles is quite intricate  and illustrates the importance of integrating knowledge of the biology of taxa whenever possible. though we cannot exclude a possible role of the ktr , we postulate that the reduction of arid environments that started 110– <dig> ma is a key factor that explains the slowdown in diversification dynamics for the family.
