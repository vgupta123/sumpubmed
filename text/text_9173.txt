BACKGROUND
molecular genetic maps covering extensive parts of the genome are essential tools for genomics research, throwing light on genome organization, facilitating marker-assisted breeding of agriculturally important quantitative and qualitative traits and map-based cloning of important genes. currently the co-dominant microsatellite based stms markers remain a standard for the construction of highly saturated linkage maps in several economically important crop plants such as wheat  <cit> , barley  <cit> , maize  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , sunflower  <cit> , rose  <cit> , apple  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and legumes like soybean  <cit>  and peanut  <cit> .

even though considerable progress has been achieved in many crops for studying the genetics of quantitative traits, in the 2nd  most important grain legume crop i.e. chickpea  , genomics-assisted programs have moved at a slow pace. the crop has a genome size of  <dig> mb and is primarily cultivated in arid and semi-arid areas of the world. despite it being a protein-rich food, the current average yield of chickpea is only  <dig> kg/ha which is far below the potential yield of  <dig>  t/ha and is relatively low as compared to pea  . susceptibility of the chickpea crop to various biotic and abiotic stresses and the low levels of genetic variability are the major constraints to its improvement  <cit> . moreover, owing to the extremely low levels of genetic polymorphism  <cit> , progress towards the development of a sufficient number of polymorphic markers has been limited. therefore in order to reap the benefits of enabling biotechnologies for crop improvement, there is a pressing need to increase the availability of genomic resources which serve as tools to assist in plant breeding programs. hence, the central goal of current chickpea researchers is to enrich genomic resources such as molecular markers, especially ssrs, and genetic linkage maps, comprising loci of both economic and scientific importance  <cit> .

among the vast repertoire of molecular markers currently available, stms markers have emerged as the best tool to address the allelic diversity in chickpea  <cit> . further, owing to their ability of interspecific transferability, stms markers have been reported to be the most elite anchor markers for merging different genetic maps and for setting up a high genome coverage consensus map in chickpea  <cit> . unfortunately, unlike other legumes like medicago and soybean, till date in chickpea only about  <dig> stms markers have been reported  <cit> , and of these only 30-40% are expected to be polymorphic. nevertheless, microsatellites which are known to be abundant and uniformly distributed in the chickpea genome have been used to develop a genotyping kit for chickpea  <cit> , analyze genetic relationships among cicer species  <cit>  and assess levels of cross-transferability  <cit> . further, these markers have been applied for the construction of intraspecific  <cit>  and interspecific  <cit>  genetic linkage maps and for mapping genes of agronomic importance such as disease resistance  <cit>  and yield related traits  <cit> , thereby demonstrating that ssrs are ideal tools for broad applications in basic and applied plant biology  <cit> . however, all these studies have repeatedly used only the limited set of available stms markers and not more than  <dig> stms markers have been mapped on the intraspecific linkage maps currently available  <cit> . hence these maps have been of limited use as genomic regions harboring genes of important traits are not yet sufficiently saturated to apply mas in plant breeding programs. therefore, the immediate need to map new genomic locations and merge different genetic maps to saturate the intraspecific maps for uniform genome coverage was clearly evident.

hence the present study was undertaken with the objective of developing a large number of stms markers which could be utilized by the chickpea community for various applications in chickpea genomics. next, these markers along with the other published stms markers were used to advance the intraspecific genetic linkage map of chickpea by defining many new genomic locations. finally, data of already published loci was integrated with our map to further saturate genomic regions.

RESULTS
characterization of microsatellites and development of stms markers
four thousand recombinant clones from the  and  microsatellite enriched library were screened which resulted in the identification of  <dig> clones that were sequenced. assembly yielded a set of  <dig> contig and  <dig> singleton dna sequences which summarized a total of  <dig> unique chickpea sequences. ssr mining revealed that  <dig> of these either contained an ssr sequence of < <dig> repeats or did not contain any microsatellites. moreover, primers could not be designed against  <dig> of the sequences due to insufficient length of ssr-flanking sequences. ultimately,  <dig>  primer pairs were designed that flanked the microsatellite motifs. all these primer pairs were validated by pcr using genomic dna from a set of four c. arietinum accessions. of these,  <dig>  primer pairs produced no pcr products under a number of annealing/elongation temperature combinations,  <dig>  amplified anomalous fragments and  <dig> yielded fragments of expected sizes. the sequences of these  <dig> functionally validated primers and the respective microsatellite motifs are listed in table  <dig> 

as expected, these  <dig> ssr containing sequences were rich in n and n motifs and based on the structural organization, the repeat motifs were classified as perfect , imperfect , compound  and interrupted . however, the predominance of ca repeats was observed  compared to ct repeats  while ca and ct compound motifs were found in the remaining clones . high variability in the numbers of microsatellite motifs were found at these loci with the maximum number of uninterrupted ga and ca units being  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. however, many long repeat motifs were also present like  <dig> at ncpgr <dig>  and  <dig> at ncpgr <dig>  the longest stretch of compound microsatellite motif was found in ncpgr <dig> with repeat motif  <dig>  but the majority of the repeat motifs comprised of 12- <dig> repeat units.  <dig> primer pairs  amplified single alleles whereas,  <dig> primers  produced 2- <dig> alleles . moreover, with  <dig> out of the  <dig> primer pairs, intraspecific variability was clearly detectable among four chickpea accessions even by resolution on simple agarose gel .

similarity search using the blastn program at ncbi revealed that the chickpea microsatellite containing sequences had homology with a variety of sequences including repetitive dna, ribosomal dna as well as coding sequences of genes and unknown proteins from diverse plant genomes. forty eight of the sequences were found to be similar to the m. truncatula bac clones whereas  <dig> sequences showed similarity to known proteins or predicted genes of the same plant. of the  <dig> sequences found to be similar to the chickpea genome, only two sequences  were similar to the chickpea polypyrimidine track-binding protein   and beta-galactosidase genes  respectively, while the remaining sequences were similar to retrotransposons and ribosomal dna.

identification of polymorphic markers and genotyping for linkage analysis
in the present study, a total of  <dig> chickpea stms markers  including  <dig> ncpgr series markers developed by us,  <dig> h-series markers developed by lichtenzveig et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> markers developed and mapped by hüttel et al. 1999; winter et al.  <dig>  <cit>  were used to identify polymorphic primers between iccv- <dig> and jg- <dig>  the parental lines of the mapping population. of the  <dig> stms primer pairs, only  <dig>  primer pairs  ncpgr series,  <dig>  h-series  <cit>  and  <dig>  of hüttel et al. 1999; winter et al.  <dig>  <cit> ) produced clear and consistent polymorphic banding patterns between the parental lines . these  <dig> polymorphic primers were further used to genotype all the  <dig> individuals of the ril population. genotyping data was obtained for all  <dig> chickpea stms markers along with  <dig> morphological marker  and used for linkage analysis.

winter et al.  <dig>  <cit> 
development of an intraspecific linkage map
joinmap ver.  <dig>   <cit>  was used to develop the intraspecific genetic linkage map using  <dig> markers of which  <dig> stms and  <dig> morphological trait  were mapped at a lod score of  <dig>  . the  <dig> stms mapped markers included  <dig> of ncpgr series,  <dig> of h series  <cit> , and  <dig> markers of hüttel et al.  <dig> and winter et al.  <dig>  <cit>  . the current linkage map covered  <dig>  cm spanning  <dig> linkage groups with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm . there was a large variation in the lengths of individual linkage groups that varied from a maximum of  <dig>  cm to a minimum of  <dig>  cm and genome coverage varying from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . relative to the estimated physical size of the chickpea genome   <cit> ,  <dig> cm distance in the present map approximately equals to  <dig>  mbp.

in order to facilitate comparisons with the previously published studies, the maps of winter et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and millan et al.  <dig>  <cit>  were considered as reference maps and the lgs in our map were named  to conform to these maps  <cit>  based on the common set of  <dig> markers present in the lgs . the current map  revealed that the markers were not distributed evenly throughout the genome as some of the linkage groups were densely populated with markers while other lgs were sparsely packed . lgvi was the largest linkage group both in terms of size  and number of mapped markers . it defined new positions of  <dig> ncpgr series and  <dig> h-series markers with an average marker density  of  <dig>  cm. the double-podding gene  also mapped to this linkage group and was flanked by ta <dig> and ncpgr <dig> at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively. this linkage group shared  <dig> markers  with the corresponding lgvi of the interspecific map  <cit> . lgv spanned  <dig>  cm, harbouring  <dig> markers and shared  <dig> common markers  with lgv  <cit> . lgiv was composed of  <dig> loci containing  <dig> ncpgr series and  <dig> h-series markers spanning  <dig>  cm with average marker density of  <dig>  cm and contained  <dig> common stms loci namely tr <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig> and ta <dig> with lgiv of winter et al.  <dig>  <cit> . lgviii was one of the smallest linkage group, having marker density of  <dig>  cm and defined positions of  <dig> ncpgr series markers. lgi spanned  <dig>  cm with  <dig> markers mapped at an average marker density of  <dig>  cm and corresponds to lgi  <cit>  as they shared  <dig> loci namely ta <dig>  tr <dig> and ta <dig>  lgii had  <dig> markers and shared  <dig> common markers  with lgii  <cit> . lgvii spanned  <dig>  cm and had an average marker density of  <dig>  cm, but did not possess any common markers from winter et al.  <dig>  <cit> . lgiii was the smallest linkage group spanning  <dig>  cm that housed only  <dig> markers, one of which  was common with lgiii of winter et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the wide range of marker density  indicated differing degrees of saturation of linkage groups with the new set of markers.

of the  <dig> stms markers analyzed,  <dig>  markers did not segregate according to the expected mendelian ratio. out of these  <dig>  the majority of markers  showed slight deviation from the ratio while  <dig> loci  exhibited significantly high segregation distortion. further, analysis revealed that the frequency of distorted female markers appeared to be double  as compared to distorted male markers . of  <dig> loci,  <dig>  markers were mapped and most of them resided on lgvi and lgvii and were indicated by arrows on the linkage groups .

map compilation and integration
comparison of our map with the recently published intraspecific map of chickpea  <cit>  was carried out. since the lgs in radhika et al.  <dig>  <cit>  were not named according to winter et al.  <dig>  <cit> , hence  <dig> common markers between our map  and that of radhika et al.  <dig>  <cit>  were identified which were distributed across five lgs. hence five of our linkage groups namely lgii, lgiv, lgv, lgvi and lgviii were integrated with the corresponding lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig> respectively of radhika et al.  <dig>  <cit>  using the program biomercator ver.  <dig>   <cit> . the map of the  <dig> compiled lgs  illustrated that even though the overall map lengths of the projected lgs remained almost same but the marker density improved dramatically. for example, after combining our lgvi  with lg <dig>  <cit>   the inter-marker distance improved to  <dig>  cm from  <dig>  cm . this combined lg a clearly helped in fine mapping of sfl region such that flanking markers ta <dig>  ncpgr <dig>  h3b <dig>  and ncpgr  <dig> which have been shown to be closely associated with the sfl gene in the previous maps  <cit>  and in our map , now position more closely at a distance of  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm, and  <dig>  cm respectively from the sfl region. remarkable improvement was also obtained when our lgiv was combined with lg <dig> of radhika et al.  <dig>  <cit>   to accommodate  <dig> positions with marker density of  <dig>  . similarly, projections of our lgii, lgv and lgviii on lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig> of radhika et al.  <dig>  <cit>  respectively, substantially improved the marker densities of each of the lgs .

discussion
availability of the chickpea genomic resources is still in its infancy. most imperative among these are the ssr markers, ests and a saturated linkage map. a critical mass of polymorphic ssr markers is still limited in chickpea as only about  <dig> have been reported till date  <cit>  of which only about 30% are expected to be polymorphic. hence, keeping in mind the limited number of available ssr markers coupled with the low levels of polymorphism in chickpea, it was necessary to generate several additional ssr markers which could be used to construct high-density genetic linkage maps of chickpea. although several intraspecific linkage maps are available for chickpea with various mapping populations  <cit> , all these maps have been constructed employing only the stms markers reported in earlier  <cit>  as well as later studies  <cit> . therefore, as expected, all these maps have exhibited similar genomic locations and similar marker order, and are therefore of limited use. thus, the primary goal of the present study was to generate new stms markers and use them to construct an intraspecific genetic linkage map of chickpea to decipher new unmapped regions of the genome. moreover the integration of this genomic information with a recently available intraspecific map was done to substantially increase the marker density, thereby facilitating the saturation of the linkage map.

the important contribution of the present study was the development of a major genomic resource comprising of  <dig> genomic stms markers developed from the microsatellite enriched library of chickpea. use of this enrichment method  <cit>  significantly increased the efficiency of ssr marker development since about 10% of the recombinants contained ssr motifs in agreement with earlier reports  <cit> . moreover a very stringent criterion was used to select the ssr motifs against which stms primers were developed. most of the ssrs selected belong to the class i type  <cit>  which include ssrs greater than  <dig> bp in length and are therefore more polymorphic and more useful as genetic markers. this was clearly evident from the data of polymorphism analysis  which showed that  <dig> % of our markers  were polymorphic. hence the developed stms markers provide a resource which in future may be utilized for the analysis of genetic diversity, map integration and qtl analysis.

another achievement of this study was the advancement of the linkage map. not only were the newly developed  <dig> stms markers used for map generation, but  <dig> additional stms markers, reported earlier but mostly unmapped, were also used . hence, a total of  <dig> microsatellite markers were used to screen for polymorphism between iccv- <dig> and jg- <dig>  the parental lines of the intraspecific ril mapping population, and this revealed  <dig>  polymorphic markers. this level of polymorphism was fairly high for a crop like chickpea which has a narrow genetic base and was comparable with earlier studies in chickpea which reported 30-40% polymorphism between the parental lines of the various intraspecific mapping populations  <cit> .

the present linkage map defined  <dig> map positions which were distributed non-randomly and unevenly over  <dig> linkage groups. the map spanned  <dig>  cm which was comparable with the previous map   <cit> . the map length was larger than the other intraspecific maps   <cit> ,   <cit> ,   <cit> ,   <cit> ,   <cit>  but smaller than the map  reported by taran et al.  <dig>  <cit> . several factors, including population size and the nature and number of markers used in the analysis, may contribute to the difference in map coverage on different populations. moreover, differences in linkage intensities among different crosses might be responsible for differences in the map coverage  <cit> . a remarkable feature of this map was the  <dig> new genomic locations that were defined in this study  in the backdrop of the previously mapped stms markers  <cit> . these new locations would be beneficial to chickpea breeders to tag important genes and qtls. even though the number of linkage groups defined in this study were the same as expected for chickpea haploid number  the density of the markers indicated the need to add more markers to the small groups which would then coalesce and be integrated to construct the detailed genetic linkage map.

about  <dig> % of markers used for linkage analysis did not follow the expected mendelian ratios. this could be compared with the studies  <cit>  in chickpea and with other plant species such as arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and medicago  <cit> . from the genetic mapping projects, it is clear that variations from expected mendelian ratios are common within both interspecific and intraspecific crosses  <cit> , however generally higher percentage of allelic distortion was observed in the former case. hence, the mapping of new stms markers on the intraspecific genetic linkage map was preferred as it would serve chickpea breeders more accurately than interspecific maps by alleviating problems like marker distortion  <cit> . in tomato, paran et al.  <dig>  <cit>  reported a significant increase in the number of loci that deviated from the expected mendelian inheritance from f <dig> to f <dig>  they accounted this increase to the cumulative effect of selection against the alleles of one of the parents during propagation of the rils. a similar level of segregation distortion was also reported for mungbean from f <dig> to f <dig> population  <cit> . interestingly, the distorted markers in the present map were majorly concentrated on linkage groups vi and vii suggesting that some structural reasons might be responsible for this distortion. moreover, most of the distorted loci  were skewed in favour of the maternal alleles i.e. jg- <dig>  this might be due to accumulation of distorted alleles in the population with progressive cycles of selfing undergone in the development of the rils  <cit> .

in the current map non-random distribution and clustering of markers was observed for most linkage groups leading to large variations in the marker density. this might be attributed to the fact that microsatellite sequences in the chickpea genome may cluster around centromeres  <cit> . similar clustering of microsatellites around the centromere has been observed in various plant species like sugarbeet  <cit> , barley  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and several other triticeae species  <cit> . several factors are responsible for this clustering of genomic ssrs on genetic linkage maps, major being their non-random physical distribution in plant genomes  <cit> , reduced recombination in centromeric regions  <cit>  and the genomic origin of dna sequences used for ssr development  <cit> .

currently, the primary goal in chickpea research programs worldwide is to generate the consensus linkage map and to increase the marker density i.e. to place as many markers as possible into a single map. comparison of the present intraspecific map of chickpea  with the interspecific map developed by winter et al.  <dig>  <cit>  and the consensus map of millan et al.  <dig>  <cit>  revealed high linkage conservation in at least  <dig> linkage groups and hence we were able to designate our lgs in accordance with these maps. however, the map distances and marker orders of the common ssr markers differed, possibly due to the intraspecific nature of our mapping population. nevertheless, by developing separate intraspecific maps for c. arietinum and c. reticulatum using common stms markers and comparing the map positions might provide the molecular insight into the chromosomal rearrangement events and evolution of chickpea from its wild progenitor c. reticulatum. in this context, it was felt that map comparisons and integration with existing intraspecific maps would be more significant. therefore an effort has been made in the present study to integrate the available information from the intraspecific maps in order to construct a more dense and saturated linkage map of chickpea. the program biomercator  <cit>  allows merging different individual genetic maps even without the availability of raw genotyping data. considering the common loci as bridges between maps, this program provides the possibility of building the compiled map by iterative projection. since common markers were identified on  <dig> lgs of our map and the recently reported map  <cit> , it was possible to combine these data using the program biomercator ver.  <dig>   <cit>  . five highly resolved lgs  were generated with substantially improved marker densities. such marker densities are highly desirable as they make application of mas and map-based cloning possible. also, highly dense maps are now proving useful for de novo sequence assembly of next generation whole genome sequence data by facilitating the anchoring and orienting of the scaffolds  <cit> .

the double-podding gene  which mapped on lgvi in our present map  was flanked by ta <dig> and ncpgr <dig> at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively  and is known to have a positive yield stabilizing effect and it is independent of seed size  <cit> . map compilation helped in saturating this region . ta <dig> which had been earlier shown to be  <dig>  cm from sfl  <cit>  and  <dig>  cm in our map , now in the projected lg a  was only  <dig>  cm apart. moreover the marker ncpgr <dig> was embedded between sfl and ta <dig>  in lgi  sfl was flanked by ncpgr <dig> at  <dig>  cm which in lg a  reduced to  <dig>  cm and accommodated  <dig> marker  between them. therefore it was clear that the compiled map would serve as a highly useful resource for future mapping projects.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we enhanced the marker repertoire in chickpea by developing a set of  <dig> novel stms markers from a microsatellite-enriched library, thereby providing researchers with advanced genomic resources for genomics-assisted breeding programs. to apply the developed resource in breeding, an advanced intraspecific genetic linkage map of chickpea was constructed. new genomic locations were mapped by utilization of new as well as the previously developed but unmapped stms markers. marker density was substantially improved by merging the map data generated in this study with the available intraspecific map. therefore this study will be directly useful in promoting future mapping projects, for dissection of complex agronomic traits and for anchoring and orienting the scaffolds required for assembly of next generation whole genome sequence data.
