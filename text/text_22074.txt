BACKGROUND
in their natural habitats, plants are exposed to a number of abiotic  and biotic  stresses which strongly undermine their darwinian fitness. to cope with herbivory, plants have evolved intricate defense mechanisms that include mechanical barriers, trichomes, thorns, latex, waxes, and a toxic-/anti-nutritive chemical arsenal deployed either constitutively  or following herbivore attack , phenolamides, trypsin protease inhibitors)  <cit> . in addition, and in concert with these direct defenses, plants recruit predators or parasitoids of the attackers using informative volatile organic compounds or nutritional rewards  <cit> . however, the costs of defense responses  <cit>  necessitate the development of stringent regulatory mechanisms and several families of plant transcription factors   have been shown to regulate plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . many of these transcription factors are co-induced in response to different stresses suggesting the existence of complex interaction  <cit> .

in many plant species, the role of phytohormones in coordinating the development of defense responses has clearly been shown, frequently with cross-talk among them to achieve intricately fine-tuned response outcomes  <cit> . specifically, the jasmonate signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating defense responses against herbivores  <cit> . in response to herbivore attack, gla <dig> enzymes release 18: <dig> α-linolenic acid  from chloroplast membranes. α-lea is subsequently converted to oxophytodienoic acid  in the chloroplasts by lipoxygenase , allene oxide synthase  and allene oxide cyclase  enzymes. opda is transported to peroxisomes and oxidized by opda reductase  forming jasmonic acid . in the cytosol, ja is conjugated to isoleucine by jar enzymes that produce the bioactive jasmonate, -7-iso-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine   <cit> . ja-ile associates with the scfcoi <dig> complex, presumably to ubiquinate jaz repressors and tag them for degradation by the 26s proteasome. in the absence of stressful conditions, myc <dig> is repressed by the jaz repressors, which recruit topless  as a co-repressor either directly through the ear  motif or using the ear motif of the ninja  protein  <cit> . degradation of jaz proteins releases the myc <dig> transcription factor from repression and reconfigures downstream transcriptional processes  <cit> .

myc <dig> is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix  family of transcription factors   <cit>  that are characterized by structurally and functionally conserved domains in many plant species. one of these conserved domains, the basic  region, is used to bind to variants of the g-box hexamer  found on the promoters of myc2-regulated genes. the hlh and zip domains are used for homo-/hetero-dimerization, while the jid  domain is used to interact with jaz proteins  <cit> .

myc <dig> transcription factors participate in the regulation of many ja-dependent physiological processes: defense against herbivores/pathogens, drought tolerance, circadian clock, light signaling and root growth  <cit> . guo et al.  <cit> , in a proteomic study that involved mock- or meja-treated wild type and myc <dig> plants, recently identified  <dig> differentially regulated, ja-inducible and myc <dig> dependent proteins involved in glucosinolate metabolism , stress and defense , photosynthesis , carbohydrate metabolism , protein folding and degradation , highlighting the very diverse roles of myc <dig> 

n. attenuata is a wild tobacco species native to the great basin desert in utah  which our group has developed into an ecological plant model. the defense responses of this species against its specialist herbivore, manduca sexta, are well studied, and include the production of potent secondary metabolites: nicotine, hgl-dtgs, phenolamides and protease inhibitors  <cit> . in this study, we identified a putative myc <dig> transcription factor in n. attenuata  and characterized its role in defense response regulation using reverse genetic, transcriptomic and untargeted/targeted metabolomic approaches. our transcriptomic and metabolomic data indicate a strong involvement of namyc <dig> in nicotine accumulation. however, silencing this gene had only a limited effect on the accumulation of other plant defense metabolites which strongly implicates the involvement of multiple independent and/or redundant transcriptional regulators in defense signaling of n. attenuata plants.

RESULTS
namyc <dig> transcripts are induced after herbivory
herbivore attack induces a transient reconfiguration of plants' transcriptome, which translates into a reconfiguration of the metabolome. in n. attenuata, transcripts of genes involved in defense against herbivores are induced after both ww and wos treatments. interestingly, many transcripts show stronger responses to wos, especially in systemically induced tissues  <cit> . in previous studies, the function of myc <dig> tfs  in plant defense regulation was demonstrated; however, the detailed regulatory mechanisms differ amongst different plant species  <cit> . in wild type n. attenuata plants, transcripts of myc <dig>  were transiently up-regulated in treated local leaves after both wounding  and simulated herbivory . in contrast, in untreated systemic leaves, myc <dig> transcripts were up-regulated only after wos treatment , consistent with the differential response of herbivory-regulated genes to ww and wos. these findings strongly suggested the involvement of namyc <dig> tf in plant defense against herbivores in n. attenuata <cit> . hence, to determine the function of myc <dig> in n. attenuata, we used a reverse genetic approach to knock down the accumulation of namyc <dig> transcripts  and characterized the inoculated plants after verifying the efficiency of the vigs procedure. compared to empty vector  plants, a significant reduction was observed in namyc <dig> transcript accumulation in myc2-vigs plants before  or  <dig> h  or  <dig> h  after wos induction . as we also identified another myc <dig> transcription factor  with a considerable protein sequence similarity to myc <dig>  we tested if its transcript accumulation was affected in myc2-vigs plants. as expected from the positioning of the myc <dig> silencing region in non-translated 3’ utr of the gene, we found no significant reduction in the accumulation of the myc2-like transcripts in myc2-vigs plants compared to ev control plants, indicating that vigs silencing was confined to myc <dig> tf . in subsequent experiments, we used the silenced plants to determine the regulatory roles of myc <dig> in plant defense in n. attenuata.

targeted analysis of secondary metabolite accumulation in myc2-vigs plants
nicotine, phenolamides, hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides  and phenolic compounds are among the potent, ja-dependent anti-herbivore compounds in n. attenuata <cit> . their ja-dependent pattern of accumulation suggests that the biosynthesis of these compounds might be regulated by namyc <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we used the myc2-vigs plants: previously, saedler and badwin  <cit>  demonstrated that vigs effectively knocks-down the expression of plant defense genes  in both leaves and roots of n. attenuata plants. then, we used a targeted metabolomic approach to compare the accumulation of defensive secondary metabolites in untreated control and wos-treated  ev and myc2-vigs plants.

nicotine
nicotine is one of the most prominent chemical defense compounds in n. attenuata <cit>  and most of the genes involved in its biosynthesis have already been identified  <cit> . nicotine is synthesized in roots and transported to leaves. to test if myc <dig> regulates herbivore-induced biosynthesis of nicotine in n. attenuata, we measured the accumulation of nicotine in untreated or wos-treated ev and myc2-vigs plants on hplc-pda. we found that compared to ev plants, the accumulation of nicotine was significantly lower before  or  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  after wos treatment in myc2-vigs plants . similar results were observed in another independent vigs experiment  demonstrating that nicotine biosynthesis is strongly regulated by the myc <dig> tf in n. attenuata. in addition to nicotine, we found myc2-specific differences in the accumulations of two other alkaloids, anatabine and cotinine, as determined by a more selective and sensitive lc-tof/ms method . interestingly, while the ion intensities of anatabine and nicotine reduced in myc2-vigs leaves, cotinine accumulation increased.

overall, our results are consistent with the previous reports which demonstrated regulation of jasmonate-induced nicotine/alkaloid biosynthesis by myc <dig> tfs. in n. tabacum bright yellow  cells that were transformed with an inverted-repeat ntmyc2a/2b construct, the accumulations of nicotine and anatabine were significantly reduced compared to untransformed controls  <cit> . the ntmyc <dig> protein was also shown to regulate nicotine biosynthesis either by directly binding to the promoters of nicotine biosynthetic genes in roots or activating nterf <dig> which, in turn, activates genes involved in nicotine biosynthesis  <cit> . in n. benthamiana, vigs of two bhlh transcription factors  as well as nberf <dig> and nbhb <dig> decreased meja-induced accumulation of nicotine  <cit> . these results demonstrate both the regulatory functions of myc <dig> and the involvement of a network of transcription factors in the regulation of nicotine biosynthesis. however, the functions of the tobacco myc <dig> genes were not examined in the context of natural herbivore feeding; neither were the effects of these myc <dig> genes on the accumulations of other tobacco defense metabolites  studied. from the phylogenetic relationship of myc/bhlh tfs in n. attenuata, n. tabacum and n. benthamiana  and our results, the presence of additional myc tfs in n. attenuata is a reasonable prediction. further characterization of these putative tfs might help to fully understand the biosynthesis and ecological consequences of nicotine/alkaloid biosynthesis. moreover, characterization of additional regulators would complement the partial regulatory function of namyc <dig> in the control of different classes of n. attenuata defense metabolites, as demonstrated in the next sections.

phenolamides
recently, regulation of the biosynthesis of phenolamides by namyb <dig> tf and its ecological relevance were reported in n. attenuata <cit> . considering a previous report in a. thaliana which indicated regulation of myb tfs by atmyc <dig>  <cit>  and our microarray data which identified a myb tf among the namyc2-regulated genes , we reasoned that, in n. attenuata, namyb <dig> or the genes it regulates might be regulated by namyc <dig>  to test this possibility, we treated ev and myc2-vigs plants by wos and measured the relative transcript abundances of namyb <dig> and downstream genes involved in phenolamide biosynthesis. the transcript accumulations of these genes did not differ between ev and myc2-vigs plants in untreated plants ; however,  <dig> h after wos treatment, a significant reduction was observed in transcript accumulations of namyb <dig> , napal , naat <dig> , nadh <dig>  and nacv <dig>  in myc2-vigs plants . our data and the previously demonstrated regulation of naat <dig>  nadh <dig>  nacv <dig> by namyb <dig> <cit>  point to the possibility that namyc <dig> controls phenolamide biosynthesis by regulating the expression of namyb <dig> 

next, we measured the wos-induced accumulation of caffeoylputrescine, dicaffeoylspermidine, chlorogenic acid and rutin in ev and myc2-vigs plants to test if the accumulation of these compounds followed the observed namyc2-dependent transcript accumulation patterns. surprisingly, we found very few significant differences between ev and myc2-vigs samples , which was also confirmed in an independent vigs experiment . in both vigs experiments, due to time required for the efficient spread of silencing, the samples used to extract secondary metabolites from ev- and myc2-vigs plants were collected at the early flowering stage from positions corresponding to bleached parts on pds-vigs plants. silencing of phytoene desaturase  leads to photo bleaching of leaves and allows for a visual verification of the spread of silencing that corresponds to clear white chlorophyll-less areas on the leaves. however, at late elongated/flowering stage, the inducible character of phenolamide accumulation is known to cease, although nothing is known about transcript accumulation at this stage  <cit> . kaur et al.,  <cit>  showed that the highly inducible levels of caffeoylputrescine  in the vegetative tissues of rosette and early-elongated stages of n. attenuata plants clearly shifted to the reproductive tissues after flowering and capsule development. consequently, hardly any caffeoylputrescine was detected in the leaves of mature plants. thus, due to the "constitutive" and localized nature of phenolamide accumulation in later stages of plant development, their biosynthesis may not be strongly influenced by namyc <dig>  alternatively, even though the transcription of the biosynthetic enzymes remains inducible at later stages of development , translation/post-translational modifications of the enzymes might not occur or the necessary substrates, such as phenylpropanoids and polyamines, could be diverted to other important functions in flowering plants. finally, it is possible that our ability to detect myc2-dependent differences was masked because of the plants' response to the vigs process  or that the level of silencing was not sufficient to affect phenolamide biosynthesis. the disconnect between transcript and metabolite data could be, therefore, explained by the dynamic and/or synergistic regulation of phenolamide biosynthesis; developmentally and by herbivore/pathogen attack. we hypothesized that namyc <dig> is likely to be involved in the regulation of phenolamide biosynthesis in younger plants. however, this could not be tested in the current experimental setup  and will require the generation of stably transformed plants.

total hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides  and tpi levels
hgl-dtgs are ja-dependent metabolites with well-demonstrated roles in plant defense against herbivores in n. attenuata <cit> . to determine if herbivore-induced accumulation of hgl-dtgs was regulated by myc <dig> in n. attenuata, we treated ev and myc2-vigs plants with wos, extracted metabolites and analyzed total hgl-dtgs by hplc-pda. we found no significant difference in the accumulation of total hgl-dtgs in control plants or plants treated with wos for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h , indicating that myc <dig> may not be involved in regulating the biosynthesis of this class of compounds. we used a radial diffusion assay  <cit>  to compare the wos-induced tpi activity between ev and myc2-vigs plants and found that, although tpi activity levels were significantly reduced  <dig> h after wos treatment, the levels were higher in myc2-vigs plants prior to induction; and this did not correlate with myc <dig> expression .

taken together and considering the ja-/coi1-dependence of hgl-dtg and tpi accumulation in n. attenuata <cit> , the biosynthesis of hgl-dtgs and tpis in n. attenuata is likely regulated by a ja-dependent, but namyc2-independent mechanism. alternatively, the function and/or synergism of an independent myc <dig> gene in n. attenuata can explain the partial function of namyc <dig>  in addition, similar to phenolamides, the accumulation of hgl-dtg and tpi is also strongly influenced by the developmental stage of the plants  <cit> . van dam et al.  <cit>  showed that the de novo synthesis of pis is limited to the early stages of plant development and that flowering plants treated with methyl jasmonate did not significantly increase their local or systemic pi activity levels. in addition, damage to older leaves elicited a much weaker systemic response in younger leaves compared to younger source leaves, a pattern also reported from other studies in n. tabacum <cit> . heiling et al.  demonstrated that the concentrations of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides  were highest in most valuable young and reproductive tissues, which is required for effective defense of these tissues against herbivores in n. attenuata.

namyc <dig> and regulation of herbivory-induced phytohormone accumulation
in a. thaliana, myc <dig> regulates genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytohormones and contributes to the feedback loop in jasmonate biosynthesis. myc <dig> also regulates its own transcription, presumably to further enhance jasmonate responses  <cit> . hence, we asked if namyc <dig> contributed to the biosynthesis or metabolism of phytohormones in n. attenuata, and to address this question, we measured the accumulation of jasmonates in untreated and wos-treated ev and myc2-vigs plants in two independent vigs experiments. in summary, no consistent, myc2-dependent differences were observed in the accumulation of ja, oh-ja, ja-ile, oh-ja-ile and cooh-ja-ile among ev and myc2-vigs plants; neither did we detect consistent differences in the accumulations of aba or sa . in agreement with these observations and unlike in a. thaliana <cit> , we did not find significant changes in transcript accumulation of any of the genes involved in the biosynthesis/metabolism of these phytohormones in our microarray data . from these observations, we conclude that, in n. attenuata, myc <dig> does not regulate the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of jasmonates, aba or sa.

performance of the specialist herbivore on myc2-vigs plants
as a key regulator of plant defense responses, we asked if the performance of the specialist herbivore, m. sexta was affected by myc <dig> silencing. consequently, we fed neonates  of m. sexta on ev and myc2-vigs plants for  <dig> d measuring their masses every  <dig> d. at all measurement times, we observed no significant difference in the mass gained by caterpillars when fed on ev or myc2-vigs plants . this is consistent with the observation that in myc2-vigs plants, significant changes were observed only in the accumulation of nicotine, a metabolite to which neonates of m. sexta are very tolerant. in contrast, in a manner that was also consistent with the patterns of metabolite accumulation in ircoi <dig> plants, neonates of m. sexta fed on coi1-silenced plants gained significantly more mass compared to those fed on wt plants  <cit> . the question is, hence, whether there are other ja/coi1-in/dependent myc <dig>  tfs that regulate these other defense metabolites of n. attenuata that are particularly important for the performance of m. sexta larvae.

large scale transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of myc2-silenced leaves
the role of myc <dig> tfs in orchestrating plant defense and developmental processes in several plant species were previously reviewed  <cit> . as master regulators, myc <dig> tfs may either directly regulate the genes responsible for defense metabolite biosynthesis or regulate their regulators  <cit> . to provide information for further work, we used unbiased approaches and compared herbivore-induced  changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of ev and myc2-vigs n. attenuata plants.

namyc <dig> regulated transcriptome of n. attenuata
for transcriptomic analysis, we treated ev and myc2-vigs plants with wos for  <dig> h and compared their respective induced transcriptome using microarrays. this approach, although unable to discover late induced metabolic genes could reveal the intermediate regulators and tfs downstream of namyc <dig>  we normalized and log2-transformed the raw data, identified genes whose expressions were significantly altered in myc2-vigs plants  package) and annotated them by blast2go. compared to ev plants, the expressions of  <dig> genes were significantly  altered in myc2-vigs plants . when we grouped the regulated genes according to tair  functional annotation scheme, the genes were found to be involved in diverse physiological processes: regulation of transcription , amino acid metabolism , secondary metabolism , biotic stress , development , transport , post-translational modification  and protein degradation  . specifically, several key regulators of plant defense responses, transcription factors  or signaling components  were among those identified by the microarray analysis. close inspection of myc2-regulated genes in n. attenuata identified additional early induced genes involved in defense against herbivores  or pathogens  . our data support the a. thaliana report in which the regulatory role of atmyc <dig> on a spectrum of physiological processes was shown: from herbivore/pathogen defense to hormone biosynthesis; from primary and/or secondary metabolism  <cit>  to photomorphogenic development  <cit> .

in contrast to independently performed qrt-pcr measurement of transcript abundances of phenolamide biosynthetic genes, the microarray analysis did not identify these genes  as differentially regulated in myc2-vigs plants compared to ev-vigs plants because these genes did not pass the strict statistical criteria set for selection of at least 2-fold down-regulated genes in microarray experiment. nicotine biosynthesis genes are only expressed in the roots and therefore could not be evaluated in the leaf samples used for microarrays.

silencing of namyc <dig> significantly affects the n. attenuata metabolome
do myc2-mediated changes in the herbivore-induced transcriptome translate into a wider spectrum of defense secondary metabolites, apart from alkaloids already demonstrated by targeted analytical approach? we used an unbiased metabolomic profiling approach by hplc/esi-tof-ms and analyzed metabolites extracted from leaves of ev and myc2-vigs plants that were continuously attacked  by neonates of m. sexta. the raw data were normalized, log2-transformed and preprocessed using xcms and camera packages as described in the methods section. to visualize the direction of the total variability in our samples without taking the class labels into consideration, we used an unsupervised approach  and observed that ev and myc2-vigs samples were separated to two clusters by pca, suggesting genotype-specific differences at the level of metabolites . the features that contributed strongly to pc <dig>  and pc <dig>  are depicted in the loading plot . when we screened for metabolic features that differed among the genotypes , we identified  <dig> features;  <dig> of which differed significantly  between ev and myc2-vigs plants . the overall pattern of regulation can be visualized from the heat map  generated on metaboanalyst  <dig>  using the significant metabolic features . in total,  <dig> metabolite features that met both fold change and t-test thresholds  were identified and the most important features were plotted on the volcano plot  . some of these features  were previously annotated as molecular fragments of metabolites involved in plant defense against herbivores in n. attenuata <cit> . however, identification and annotation of the remaining features remain as significant challenge for future experiments. overall, our metabolomic analysis demonstrates the importance of myc <dig> in the regulation of plant's metabolome and when these metabolomic features are annotated, it will be possible to precisely map the regulatory role of myc <dig> on plant defense and developmental responses.

CONCLUSIONS
in many plant species, attack from herbivores elicits a cascade of complex transcriptional and metabolic responses that improve plant defense. the effectiveness of plant defense depends on the efficiency by which the timing and duration of responses are regulated. in this study, we identified a myc <dig> tf in n. attenuata and characterized its regulatory role using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches. transcriptionally, we showed that the expressions of many genes, including transcription factors, involved in plant development or defense responses were affected when myc <dig> was silenced in n. attenuata. this was supported by the metabolomic data which identified a large number of differentially regulated molecular features following the silencing. most importantly, as was previously reported in n. tabacum and n. benthamiana, we showed that namyc <dig> regulates the in planta accumulation of nicotine in n. attenuata leaves. the fact that myc <dig> did not strongly affect the accumulation of other ja-dependent metabolites, hgl-dtgs and proteinase inhibitors, suggests that another myc tf is likely involved in the process.

despite the considerable conservation of the basic components of plant defense responses among different plant species, substantial variations exist in the responses outcomes which highlights between-species differences in downstream regulatory fine-tuning  <cit> . for example, in contrast to the considerable similarity among members of the genus nicotiana in the regulation of nicotine biosynthesis by myc <dig>  <cit>  , silencing myc <dig> in n. attenuata did not have the exact same effects as reported in a. thaliana; we did not observe a role of myc <dig> either in a positive feedback loop activating ja biosynthesis or in a negative feedback involving suppression of the jasmonate response through the activation of jaz repressors  <cit> .

in addition, not all ja-dependent defense metabolites  were regulated by myc <dig> in n. attenuata. in fact, when compared against the diversity of defense metabolites in n. attenuata, the regulatory function of myc <dig> is quite limited. this rather limited role suggests that other members of the bhlh family of transcription factors might be involved in the regulation of defense responses not regulated by myc <dig>  the recent identification of additional myc <dig> tfs in a. thaliana <cit> , n. tabacum <cit>  and n. benthamiana <cit>  with overlapping or distinct functions support this conjecture.

indeed, we found an additional myc2-like gene  in diploid n. attenuata showing a  <dig> % protein sequence identity with namyc <dig>  in the phylogenetic analysis, myc2-like protein clustered separately from the myc <dig> clade of solanaceae species, including n. tabacum myc2a and myc2b. when we briefly examined the function of myc2-like gene in n. attenuata, interestingly, increased defense responses in myc2-like-vigs plants were observed . this was in a strong contrast to silencing the namyc <dig>  but in agreement with the vigs–induced silencing of the n. benthamiana bhlh <dig> , which increased the nicotine content in the vigs-silenced n. benthamiana plants after foliar application of meja  <cit> . therefore, some of the myc2-like genes may work as repressors of ja-induced responses, contributing to a fine-tuning of defense against herbivores, possibly by competing for promoter binding sites with the activator-type myc <dig> genes. as previously demonstrated for the transient character of ja-ile accumulation  <cit> , tight control of ja signaling is likely to be essential for plant responses to multiple biotic stresses in the environment. identification and characterization of additional myc <dig> tfs in n. attenuata and other plant species is likely to provide a more complete mechanistic picture of ja-regulated defense responses.

considering the high degree of conservation in the binding site of myc <dig> tfs in different species  <cit> , we believe future research in determining the binding sites of these tfs will be critical to understanding their function. when these binding sites are identified, additional myc2-dependent genes or other transcription factors that respond to herbivory, disease, environmental stress or development can be more readily identified. it would be interesting to identify the interacting partners of myc <dig> tfs in n. attenuata and characterize the mechanisms of interaction to understand how the signaling components evolved. in a. thaliana, transcriptional regulation by myc <dig> requires interactions with important regulatory elements including members of the mediator complex proteins , chromatin-opening proteins like general control non-repressible  <dig> , members of the histone acetyl transferase family and splayed   <cit> . identification and characterization of homologues of these components in n. attenuata might test the generality of the signaling processes across different plant families.
