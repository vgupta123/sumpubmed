BACKGROUND
affinity tags have been widely used for the study of protein interactions and the isolation of protein complexes. such tags are also increasingly used in chip assays in detecting the in vivo binding of transcription factors and associated co-factors to their target genes in chromatin. in searching for the optimal affinity tag for chip applications, three criteria are important:  tags must have high binding affinity;  tags should be preferably small and not strongly charged so as to minimize possible interference with transcription factor function  tags should be fairly insensitive to formaldehyde fixation. the latter is true for most tags that contain no or few lysine, arginine or histidine residues  <cit> .

the biotin/avidin affinity system fulfils the above criteria due to its unique characteristics  <cit> , which include:  the very tight and specific binding of biotin by avidin  which, with a kd of  <dig> l*mol - <dig>  is one of the highest non covalent interactions known in nature, close to almost  <dig> – 106times greater than the interaction of epitopes with their specific antibodies. once formed, the biotin-streptavidin complex is not disturbed by changes in ph, introduction of detergents or high salt concentration, thus remaining stable even under very stringent washing conditions;  biotin is a very small molecule and is not known to affect the biological activity of tagged proteins  <cit> ;  there are few  naturally biotinylated proteins in mammalian cells, as a result the non-specific background binding of nuclear extract is low  <cit> .

we have previously used  <cit>  a short  biotinylatable tag  <cit>  for the purification of gata- <dig> protein complexes from nuclear extracts of erythroid cells. gata- <dig> is a dna sequence-specific zinc finger transcription factor that is essential for the differentiation of erythroid, megakaryocytic, eosinophil and mast cell lineages  <cit> . n-terminally tagged gata- <dig> was co-expressed with the e. coli bira biotin ligase in mouse erythroleukemic  cells and subsequently purified from nuclear extracts together with interacting proteins by high affinity binding to streptavidin beads  <cit> . in this way, a number of known and novel gata- <dig> protein partners were identified  <cit> . we also tested the utility of the biotin tag and streptavidin binding in chip assays and provided preliminary evidence that it can be successfully applied in place of antibodies in chips of gata- <dig> target genes  <cit> . subsequent work in other labs has provided further supporting evidence for the application of biotinylation tagging in chip and chip-on-chip assays  <cit> . thus, despite the fact that biotin contains groups that are crosslinkable by formaldehyde, it can be successfully employed in chip assays

in this manuscript we present steps for improving the efficiency of biotinylation tagging in chip applications, using biotin-tagged gata- <dig> in combination with known target genes  <cit>  as an example. we first show that different streptavidin beads are not equally efficient in chip assays. we also show that effective blocking with fish skin gelatin and omission of sds during chromatin sonication are important factors in reducing background signals, which is a major concern in chip using complex chromatin from mammalian cells. furthermore, we explored the utility of double affinity tags in chip assays. different tags may be used in tandem, separated by a protease cleavage site to allow for differential purification using either tag or for two sequential affinity purification steps using both tags to lower the background of non-specific proteins. at the same time, this approach can greatly enhance the ability to purify the complexes to homogeneity  for other applications. to these ends, we combined the biotin tag with the v <dig> tag and show that the v <dig> tag antibody mediated chip is as efficient as the biotin streptavidin chip. these results have important implications when it comes to selecting an optimal strategy for genomic chip and proteomic analyses of transcription factor functions.

RESULTS
we previously showed using biotin-tagged gata- <dig> that streptavidin binding of crosslinked chromatin can substitute for antibodies in enriching for gata- <dig> target genes in chip assays  <cit> . due to the potential advantages offered by the very high affinity of streptavidin for binding to biotin and the importance of having multiple tags that can be used in the same cell, we wanted to extend these observations in developing an optimized protocol for the streptavidin binding of chromatin from cells expressing biotin-tagged gata- <dig>  in doing so, we used the eklf and c-myb promoters as examples of gata- <dig> gene targets that are upregulated or repressed, respectively, in erythroid cells. figure 1a  and additional file 1a  show the location of primers used for the eklf and myb promoters and negative control sequences. primer sequences are listed in table  <dig> 
comparison of different types of streptavidin beads
biotinylation of biological substrates is frequently used in a variety of different applications and hence many manufacturers offer a wide range of immobilized streptavidin matrices. we have previously used paramagnetic m <dig> streptavidin dynabeads for the isolation of protein complexes  <cit> . we also tested the performance of m <dig> beads in chromatin immunoprecipitations and compared them to three other available matrices: streptavidin agarose, streptavidin mutein and neutravidin. streptavidin agarose was used to test whether an immobilization matrix different to that of paramagnetic particles would give better yields. neutravidin is a streptavidin derivative without carbohydrate side chains which is predicted to reduce background binding. streptavidin mutein is a mutated recombinant streptavidin which binds biotin with a lower affinity thus allowing elution of bound material under gentler conditions by using biotin. chromatin from biotin-tagged gata- <dig> cells and control cells expressing bira ligase only, was bound to different types of beads under identical conditions . biotin-tagged gata- <dig> was eluted from the beads by decrosslinking, except for the mutein beads where we used biotin for elution. we find that the m <dig> streptavidin dynabeads are the most efficient in capturing biotin-tagged gata- <dig> bound to the eklf  and myb  promoters. using m <dig> beads, we also find clear enrichment of gata- <dig> binding to regulatory elements of the repressed gata- <dig> locus . as a result, the m <dig> dynabeads were used in all subsequent experiments.

pre-clearing chromatin
pre-clearing of chromatin is one of the methods used to decrease background binding in chip assays using antibodies. we tested this by preclearing chromatin with protein g paramagnetic beads  for  <dig> hour at 4°c. as shown in figure  <dig>  this resulted in lower background and improved enrichment of eklf sequences bound by biotin tagged gata- <dig>  similar results were also obtained with the c-myb promoter .

blocking with fish skin gelatin
among various blocking compounds  fish skin gelatin  has been shown to be very effective for blocking in western and elisa experiments  <cit> . in addition, fgel is a very inexpensive reagent compared to other blocking reagents such as bsa. we therefore investigated whether the use of fgel for blocking would improve the performance of m <dig> beads in a streptavidin chip. figure  <dig> shows that addition of as little as  <dig> %  of fgel  can significantly improve the yield of eklf target sequences bound by gata- <dig>  similar results were also observed with the c-myb promoter and gata- <dig> locus sequences . thus, blocking the beads for  <dig> hour with fgel and salmon sperm dna reduces the background compared to blocking with salmon sperm dna alone. in addition to blocking the beads, we also added 1% fgel to chromatin during binding to the beads and obtained similar results to those when fgel was used for blocking the beads only . as a result, we have included 1% fgel in blocking the beads in all subsequent experiments.

it has been shown previously that biotin tagging allows more stringent washes  compared to other affinity tags  <cit> . for example, urea and thiourea are reagents widely used in proteomics to resuspend hydrophobic proteins. we therefore tested whether the background binding of hydrophobic proteins can be reduced by washing in urea/thiourea/sds. we found that the additional wash did not significantly lower the background or increase the specific binding signals of the eklf or c-myb promoters  and this parameter was not investigated further.

the non-covalent binding of biotin to streptavidin is one of the strongest known in nature  <cit> . however this presents a drawback when eluting bound chromatin from the beads as is usually done in chip using antibodies. we were indeed unsuccessful in eluting the biotinylated protein from the streptavidin beads. the only way it could be removed was by boiling, which may result in some background due to the co-elution of non-specifically bound proteins. alternatives would be the inclusion of protease  cleavage sites  <cit> , or the use of double tags .

sonication without sds
most chip protocols, including those used in our laboratory, are based on the upstate  chip protocol which includes sonicating chromatin in a buffer containing 1% sds. addition of sds introduces stringent conditions and helps prevent the aggregation of insoluble protein complexes. however, high sds concentration may affect optimal binding of chromatin by the antibody or beads and, in some approaches, inclusion of sds is not compatible with further experimental procedures, for example in chromatin fractionation by cscl gradient centrifugation  <cit> .

we therefore tested whether sonicating chromatin without sds would improve the efficiency of a streptavidin chip. omission of sds did not affect the efficiency of dna shearing. sonicating chromatin without sds resulted in higher enrichment of the eklf  and c-myb  promoter sequences, albeit with a small increase in the background binding of the eklf negative control sequence. thus, omitting sds from the sonication buffer improves the yield of a streptavidin pull-down significantly. we next tested whether the omission of sds would also improve a chip in a regular antibody precipitation. for this purpose we tested the precipitation of a rad <dig> gene target which, under the standard sds conditions, can be enriched 4– <dig> fold over background. this represents a borderline enrichment for further analysis by chip-sequencing . when a rad <dig> chip to a site in the β globin locus in i/ <dig> erythroid cells was carried out with or without sds, the sample without sds gave a considerable improvement in enrichment .

comparison of biotin and v <dig> epitope tags to anti gata- <dig> n <dig> and m <dig> antibodies
the experiments described above were carried out with an n-terminally biotin-tagged gata- <dig>  <cit> . we also generated a second construct containing a tandem affinity tag created by fusing the short  biotin tag  <cit>  with the 14aa v <dig> tag to the c-terminus of gata- <dig> . v <dig> is a short peptide sequence derived from the c-terminus of the p and v proteins of simian virus  <dig>  <cit> . this construct can be used in the two-step affinity purification of tagged protein complexes, thus reducing background binding. alternatively, one of the tags can be used on its own in cases where the second tag is inefficient, for example due to reduced accessibility in crosslinked chromatin. these are important considerations in chip experiments particularly in applications involving chip-on-chip or chip sequencing. this construct also allows comparison with the streptavidin-chip results obtained with the biotin tag fused to the n-terminus of gata- <dig> 

we obtained a mel stable transfectant expressing gata-1-v5-bio at approximately equal levels to the endogenous gata- <dig> protein . we compared the efficiency of chip by streptavidin binding or v <dig> antibody immunoprecipitation to two anti-gata- <dig> antibodies: the n <dig> rat monoclonal antibody against the n-terminus of gata- <dig> and the m <dig> goat polyclonal antibody against the c-terminus of gata- <dig>  we find that both the streptavidin pull-down with m <dig> dynabeads and the chip with v <dig> antibodies are at least as good as or more efficient in enriching for eklf sequences compared to the anti-gata- <dig> n <dig> and m <dig> antibodies, when compared to igg controls or chromatin from cells expressing bira only .

the v5-chip also works very efficiently, as it gives 12-fold higher enrichment in specific binding to the eklf enhancer in comparison to the non-specific binding to non-related sequence . in fact, the v <dig> tag appears to work at least as good as streptavidin binding in chip. when normalising to control cells expressing only bira, the v <dig> chip gives actually a slightly better enrichment compared to the streptavidin chip , albeit with a slightly higher background binding to the negative control sequence . however, we cannot exclude that the elution from the anti-v <dig> agarose beads is more efficient than that from the m <dig> streptavidin beads.

formaldehyde crosslinking affects the biotin-tag more than the v <dig> tag
formaldehyde cross-linking as first introduced by salomon et al in drosophila  <cit> , has been widely used to study the binding of proteins to dna elements in intact cells. formaldehyde crosslinks proteins primarily through lysine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine residues  <cit> . biotinylation tagging takes place through the addition of a biotin moiety to a single lysine residue present in the peptide tag, thus rendering this lysine residue unavailable for crosslinking, however, the biotin molecule has two nitrogens in the ring structure that are crosslinkable . with this in mind, we compared how the biotin tag or the v <dig> tag, a 14aa long tag containing lysine and asparagine residues , are affected by formaldehyde crosslinking. to this end, the extracts containing equal amounts of gata-1-v5-bio  were bound under identical conditions. input, bound and unbound fractions were loaded on an sds-page gel and the western blots were detected with an anti gata- <dig>  antibody followed by detection with streptavidin-hrp. the results showed that the binding of crosslinked material to the m <dig> dynabeads was good but less efficient compared to non-crosslinked protein extract, since there was more gata-v5-bio found in unbound fraction . in addition, anti-gata- <dig> antibody as well as streptavidin-hrp detection  showed that there was less gata-1-v5-bio bound to the m <dig> dynabeads in cross-linked extract pull-down than in non-crosslinked material . these results would be expected considering that some of the biotin tagged gata- <dig> protein would be inaccessible for binding by m280-streptavidin beads in the crosslinked chromatin, as has also been observed with epitope access by antibodies in chip.

we next tested how formaldehyde crosslinking affects binding to anti-v <dig> agarose. the western blot data presented in figure 7c suggest that crosslinked and non-crosslinked material can be efficiently bound by anti-v <dig> beads . the data suggest that the efficiency of binding of crosslinked chromatin using the v <dig> tag is higher than that of streptavidin chip . however, efficient recovery of chromatin from the v <dig> beads relies on efficient elution with the v <dig> peptide. in addition, in other cases we have not seen this difference  suggesting that the structure of the target protein may also have an influence.

discussion
we describe optimised conditions for the application of streptavidin-chip using crosslinked chromatin from cells expressing a biotin-tagged transcription factor. we show that pre-clearing chromatin and blocking streptavidin beads with fish skin gelatin reduces the background binding. in addition, avoiding sds in the sonication buffer appears to increase enrichment for bio-gata- <dig> binding to specific dna sequences. we also compared streptavidin-chip to antibody chip using two different anti-gata- <dig> antibodies and showed the former to be more efficient. the real difference in efficiencies between streptavidin-chip and antibody chip is even bigger because the anti-gata- <dig> antibodies precipitate both the tagged and endogenous gata- <dig>  whereas streptavidin binds only tagged gata- <dig>  this means that the enrichments obtained with antibodies should be hypothetically approximately twice as high as with affinity tags pull-downs. the same applies for the efficiency of v <dig> chip, since, as mentioned above, the relative levels of bio-v5- tagged gata- <dig> and endogenous gata- <dig> in the extract used in this experiment are similar . thus, the results obtained with anti-gata- <dig> antibodies are an overestimate when compared to the tag-based chips described here.

a potential drawback of biotinylation tagging in streptavidin chip is related to previous reports of histones being naturally biotinylated  <cit> . though it remains unknown what proportion of histones is biotinylated in vivo, the fact that previous studies have shown nuclear biotin to account for less than 1% of total cellular biotin  <cit>  suggests that it is very little. in addition, we have performed extensive protein analyses by mass spectrometry and, whereas we find histones co-purifying with biotin tagged transcription factors, they do not represent any significant proportion of the background, nor did we notice an increase of histone peptides upon expression of bira in cells  <cit> . similarly, the purification of a histone variant protein complex by biotinylation tagging and streptavidin purification showed negligible histone binding  <cit> . lastly, biotinylation tagging has been employed in chip-on-chip approaches of transcription factors and of the histone h <dig>  variant, again with no evidence of background due to endogenous histone biotinylation  <cit> . taken together, this evidence suggests that any background due to histone biotinylation is likely to be very low. in fact, one of the advantages of employing biotinylation tagging of different factors with streptavidin chip is that background will be the same in all cases, whereas different antibodies present with different backgrounds.

we also provide evidence that a tandem affinity tag composed of the biotin tag and the v <dig> epitope tag works very efficiently in chip. the biotin tag binding is fast and very tight, while the binding to v <dig> epitope is reversible , thus each tag can be used to advantage. on the basis of this evidence, we propose a scheme whereby optimal binding of chromatin, under the conditions described here, first by anti-v <dig> agarose, followed by elution using v <dig> peptide and re-binding by streptavidin beads, followed by elution/reversal of crosslinks provides a convenient and rapid purification method. our preliminary chip-sequencing data  show that biotin and v <dig> tagging can both be very effectively used for transcription factor target sequence mapping and that the  background seen in these experiments contains mostly non-specific dna fragments that can be easily distinguished from specific target sites.

CONCLUSIONS
the optimal conditions for streptavidin chip described here and the use of biotin-v <dig> tandem affinity tagging of transcription factors offers an easy, rapid and effective way for comparative and functional studies of different transcription complexes.
