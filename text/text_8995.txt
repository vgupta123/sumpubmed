BACKGROUND
garlic , the second most important allium crop after the bulb onion, is cultivated worldwide and consumed by almost every culture as a popular condiment and green vegetable. it is also known for its medicinal and neutraceutical properties, with a large spectrum of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity  <cit> . none of the known commercial garlic cultivars and landraces produce fertile flowers or seeds. therefore, garlic is not propagated sexually, and neither classical breeding nor genetic studies are currently employed with this plant. nevertheless, over the past 20 years, fertility restoration has been achieved in a number of garlic genotypes, mostly landraces from central asia  <cit> , and physiological studies have led to flowering induction and seed production by environmental manipulation  <cit> . self- and cross-pollination within and between garlic genotypes has become a reality, thus enabling the initiation of genetic studies and classical breeding in garlic  <cit> .

garlic generates the highest known concentration of organosulfur compounds among allium species. these are responsible for both garlic’s pungent odor and many of its medicinal benefits. the levels of the flavor precursors, non-protein cysteine and glutathione derivatives, account for 1–5% of the garlic's dry weight  <cit> , indicating the major importance of organosulfur biosynthetic activity within the plants' tissues. these compounds serve two roles in the life cycle of the plant: pest deterrence and the storage and transport of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur  <cit> . the major garlic flavor precursor is sulfur-alkyl cysteine sulfoxide . this chemical is broken down by alliinase to pyruvate, ammonia and thiosulfinate allicin, which are the sources of the typical aroma and proposed health-beneficial properties of garlic  <cit> .

like many perennial monocots, edible allium species have very large genome sizes of 10– <dig> gbp  <cit> . the diploid garlic  nuclear genome is estimated at  <dig>  gbp,  <dig> times larger than the genome of rice  <cit> . therefore, full sequencing of the garlic genome is a challenging task, but transcriptome assembly using next generation sequencing might be efficiently employed for the generation of functional genomic data. this approach has been successfully applied to perennial crops, e.g., peony  <cit> , pomegranate  <cit> , orchid  <cit>  and arundo donax  <cit> , as well as to the bulbous monocots tulipa and lilium  <cit>  and onion  <cit> . in garlic, the first transcriptome analysis based on rna from the renewal buds resulted in de novo assembly of  <dig>  unigenes which were annotated and analyzed with respect to gene ontology  and metabolic pathways  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments showed differential expression in the leaf, meristematic and flower tissues  <cit> .

since only a few garlic genotypes are able to produce flowers and viable seeds, getting this plant to flower is still a challenge, and genetic regulation of the reproductive process is of special interest  <cit> . recent physiological studies have facilitated flowering induction and fertility restoration by environmental manipulations in a variety of garlic genotypes  <cit> , and our research group currently maintains numerous genotypes of fertile seed-producing garlic genotypes. a further and deeper understanding of the genetic make-up of garlic reproductive traits is required for both improved genetic and physiological knowledge and exploitation of the genetic potential of this important crop.

in this report, we describe the de novo assembly of a transcriptome catalogue for fertile garlic, and provide a few examples of its analysis. this is the first reported garlic transcriptome representing genes expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs, which were sampled and analyzed throughout plant development, from clove sprouting to flowering and bulbing. the results provide a platform for further research and breeding of this important crop.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and annotation
to establish a transcriptome catalogue for fertile garlic, we used miseq pair-end technology, which enabled us to create an assembly of longer contigs. while the long-read protocol is considerably more expensive than short-read sequencing, important benefits include a lower mapping bias and reduced ambiguity in assigning reads to genomic elements, such as mrna transcripts  <cit> . six cdna libraries from six garlic organs yielded approximately  <dig>  million long 250-bp paired-end reads . quality trimming and filtration resulted in  <dig>  million cleaned reads that were assembled using trinity, and generated  <dig>  contigs for the "extensive transcriptome catalogue". the average contig length was 715 bp; half of these  were at least  <dig>  bp long. the elimination of contigs with fewer than  <dig> total mapped reads resulted in a further reduction, resulting in a total of  <dig>  contigs, assembled separately into an “abundant transcriptome catalogue”. clustering the sequences with 95% identity revealed a redundancy of less than 10% in both the extensive and abundant transcriptomes.table  <dig>

both transcriptome catalogues of garlic were compared with the database of oryza sativa—the most sequenced and annotated monocot species . blastx search against the rice database resulted in at least one significant hit for  <dig>  contigs of the extensive garlic transcriptome ;  <dig>  of those contigs represented  <dig> % of the contigs of the abundant transcriptome. in a reciprocal tblastn search of the rice genes in the extensive garlic transcriptome, at least one significant hit was found for  <dig>  rice sequences, i.e., 67% of the rice sequences were found in garlic .figure  <dig>

comparison of the abundant garlic transcriptome with public databases revealed various levels of similarity with the model species arabidopsis and oryza, as well as other bulbous geophytes . databases of arabidopsis, rice and nrncbi showed a general similarity of 45–47% with our data. in addition, the nrncbi protein database was used to search for the five top hits. among the  <dig>  contigs annotated in the abundant transcriptome, 27% show high similarity to oryza sativa,  <dig> % to hordeum,  <dig> % to triticum, and 8% to arabidopsis . the main reason for such similarity might be higher representation of the genomic resources for these species. there were abundant transcriptome matches with  <dig> published genes from  <dig> allium species and  <dig> genes from  <dig> geophyte species that were closely or remotely related to garlic . of the contigs obtained here,  <dig> corresponded with at least  <dig> known garlic viruses.table  <dig>

*based on  <dig>  sequences specific to garlic leaves.



although 78% of the sequences were homologous with the previously reported transcriptome of garlic renewal bud  <cit> , reads of our transcriptome were much longer  than those of this previous report , and therefore represented larger portions of the full genes. in addition, blastn analysis identified 51–58% similarity of the reference transcriptome with onion accessions  <cit> . it is interesting to note that the similarity between the abundant catalogue and the published sequences of bulbous monocots lilium and tulipa  <cit>  was rather low—only  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. however, taking into account that reports for lilium and tulipa include only the leaf transcriptome, we repeated the blastn analysis with the  <dig>  contigs specific to garlic leaves. in this case, much higher match was obtained,  <dig>  and  <dig> % for lilium and tulipa, respectively. in comparison, the resemblance between rice and the annotated transcriptomes of lilium and tulipa reaches 49% and 30%, respectively  <cit> . this clearly demonstrates that comparative analyses between transcriptomes that include samples from various organs at different stages of plant development provide more reliable results. transcriptome analysis from only one plant organ or tissue does not provide a full transcript catalogue, even though it can serve numerous specific genetic and breeding objectives  <cit> .

comparative phylogeny of monocots has suggested that the divergence between liliales  and asparagales  occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, while divergence between poales  and asparagales took place later, between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . although asparagales and liliales have evolved many traits in parallel and it is difficult to separate them morphologically, gene-sequencing analysis supports these two orders as two separate monophyletic groups  <cit> . rice might be phylogenetically closer to asparagales than to liliales, and therefore, only a relatively low number of shared possible orthologous groups are identified between rice, garlic, tulipa and lilium. on the other hand, the low ratio of similarity demonstrates a potential source of unidentified specific genes that need to be annotated in bulbous monocots. it is also possible that genes from bulbous monocots deviate at the sequence level from the allied genes existing in the databases, or that some of the transcripts in the published transcriptomes were not long enough to find a significant similarity with annotated genes.

organ-specific expression analysis
analysis of the extensive transcriptome showed that most contigs are shared between plant organs, but only  <dig> %  are common to all studied organs . on the other hand, numerous contigs were organ-specific, i.e., to the roots , leaves , basal plate  and clove tissue . similarly, large differences in gene-expression patterns between different tissues, especially between root and aerial organs, have been reported for other plants, e.g. arabidopsis  <cit>  and glycine max  <cit> . in rice, 69% of the expressed transcripts show significantly variable expression levels among tissues/organs  <cit> . in our study, the number of specific reads was exceptionally high in the reproductive organs— <dig>  transcripts expressed only in inflorescences and flowers, representing  <dig> % of the extensive transcriptome—thus confirming that the signaling and transcriptional control of reproductive development involves a number of regulatory mechanisms and a large number of genes. similarly,  <dig>  pollen-preferential transcripts are expressed in rice pollen  <cit> , and  <dig>  soybean genes are flower-specific  <cit> . detailed transcriptome comparisons between different species may reveal evolutionarily conserved genes and molecular mechanisms in plant reproduction processes. such comparisons require comprehensive transcriptome datasets of tissues and developmental stages, and precise annotations of orthologous genes between species  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
common and specific contigs found in the extensive transcriptome catalogue of the various organs of fertile garlic. note the high number of specific contigs in the reproductive tissues. samples of the reproductive organs  are unified for this analysis.



global gene-expression profiling of the abundant transcriptome revealed differential patterns between the vegetative and reproductive organs . the vegetative organs could be clustered into two defined groups, with the underground organs—roots and basal plate—sharing both close proximity and many expressed sequences. in bulbous geophytes, the basal plate  is morphologically associated with the roots, leaves and renewal buds  <cit> . when the reproductive stage begins, an apical meristem forms the floral scape and inflorescence. flower differentiation in garlic is affected by endogenous and environmental signals. however, it is not clear whether florogenesis is regulated by direct signal transduction from the vegetative organs, or is only supported by photosynthetic products and storage materials from foliage leaves and the underground bulb  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
hierarchical cluster analysis of gene-expression patterns in six vegetative and reproductive organs of garlic. the heat map shows the relative expression levels of each contig  in each sample . four identified gene clusters  are differentially expressed in one or more organs. organs are clustered to reproductive and vegetative, with closer proximity between the roots and basal plates . expression values  are log2-transformed and then median-centered by transcript.



hierarchical cluster analysis of gene-expression patterns revealed four significantly different groups of contigs . alterations in gene expression provided information on organography of the expression patterns.

cluster # <dig>  consisted of  <dig>  transcripts, enriched mainly in vegetative organs. employing go enrichment analysis in this cluster revealed gene-expression patterns reflecting intense metabolic activity, transport, and regulation of the stress response . biological processes related to responses to external stimuli, such as inorganic and organic substances, and to various types of abiotic stress, such as osmotic, oxidative or salt stress, were prominent in the roots and basal plate. regulation of cellular response to stress in the roots might be induced by endogenous stimuli, by interactions with symbionts and pathogens, or by wounding. the main metabolic functions of cluster # <dig> included antioxidant activities, especially oxidoreductase, reductase, and carbon-sulfur lyase activities. in plants, the deleterious effect of reactive oxygen species  accounts for many of the stress conditions and abiotic damage. to protect against injury by free radicals, living organisms have developed a battery of antioxidant defenses, such as the enzymes superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione peroxidase  <cit> . in addition, small molecules, including glutathione and other organosulfur compounds, play a significant role in the defense against ros effects. it is therefore suggested that roots might play a substantial role in stress resistance and antioxidant defense in garlic plants.

cluster # <dig>  contained  <dig>  contigs, with a slightly higher ratio of enriched genes in the cloves and roots. however, only a small number of the genes in this cluster were organ-specific. molecular functions, analyzed by the go test tool, showed enrichment in go terms involved in catalytic activity, mainly related to carbohydrate transferases. these findings certainly support the concept of carbohydrate accumulation in the storage organs during growth and dormancy induction in garlic  <cit>  and other geophytes  <cit> . on the other hand, analysis of cluster # <dig> clearly showed over-representation of genes involved in plant–pathogen interactions, including processes related to viral genome replication and symbiosis between viruses and the garlic plant .

cluster # <dig>  contained  <dig>  contigs. numerous genes, mostly specific to the reproductive process, were abundant . the major processes encoded by these genes in the reproductive tissues involved floral morphogenesis, development of male and female reproductive organs, cell division, and gametophyte development. at least  <dig> go terms were significantly enriched in the reproductive organs. nevertheless, go analyses showed a variety of biological processes, including dna replication and modification, regulation of rna synthesis, cell cycle, cellular component organization activity and more . at the cellular level, these processes were associated with cytoskeleton and microtubule activities and chromosomes . go terms of flower morphogenesis, pollen formation, cell cycle and organelle organization were notable . this variety might be justified by the wide range of developmental stages sampled: reproductive organ samples were collected from very young inflorescences with undifferentiated flower primordia, through flower buds with developing anthers and gynoecia, to fully developed flowers at anthesis.

cluster # <dig>  was relatively small, consisting of  <dig>  contigs with significant representation in the foliage leaves. carbohydrate metabolic activities and photosynthetic processes were notable . in addition, the metabolism and transport of sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen were prominent. genes associated with synthesis of lipid, sugar and aromatic compounds were over-represented, and expression related to metabolic activity was high. in terms of cellular localization, the processes occurred in most organelles, as well as in membranes and intracellular spaces.

of the  <dig> most abundant proteins in the abundant transcript catalogue,  <dig> matched known sequences from onion and garlic, and another  <dig> were highly similar to proteins reported from medicago, vitis and nelumbo. three proteins with highest expression in the leaves and flowers were unidentified .

to date, the identification of genes controlling garlic development or metabolic pathways has been based on a restricted number of gene orthologues  <cit> . establishment of the garlic transcriptome allows for large-scale identification of genes showing tissue-specific expression.

orthologues of key flowering genes and their expression in garlic organs
orthologues of several key flowering genes  were found in the transcriptome by matching with known gene sequences from arabidopsis, oryza and allium cepa databases . in model plants, the floral-induction pathways have been shown to be integrated into a flowering network, which contains several steps  <cit> . thus, in arabidopsis, these pathways involve an array of transcription factors , regulators of chromatin structure , the putative kinase inhibitor ft, and many other genes  <cit> . the key genes controlling flowering in arabidopsis are conserved in other species. for instance, in onion, some of these genes are involved not only in the flowering process, but also in the photoperiodic control of bulb initiation  <cit> . our analysis of gene expression in various organs of garlic demonstrated that orthologues of flowering genes can be involved in numerous biological processes, including flower initiation, stem elongation and bulbing.table  <dig>

*numerous sequences with significant similarity were identified.



numerous isoforms identified for some of the key flowering genes, e.g., ft, ap <dig>  sep <dig> and ag, varied in their expression in garlic organs. as an example, at least four sequences of ft orthologues were differentially expressed, with significant over-representation in inflorescences and flowers , roots and basal plate , or cloves . ft homologues are involved in a range of plant developmental processes. in perennial tomato, the orthologue sft has been shown to regulate diverse growth processes, such as the flowering, growth and termination cycles typical of perennial plants, leaf maturation, growth of stems, and the formation of abscission zones  <cit> . ft homologues are involved in leaf development and flower induction in narcissus  <cit>  and tuberization in potato  <cit> . in onion, at least four different ft genes regulate flowering and bulb formation. flowering is promoted by vernalization and correlates with upregulation of acft <dig>  whereas bulb formation is regulated by two antagonistic ft-like genes  <cit> . ft orthologues identified in the garlic transcriptome demonstrate strong homology to the onion ft-like genes and might similarly regulate developmental processes in garlic.figure  <dig>

although garlic genetics is still in its infancy, we believe that new transcriptome data will significantly accelerate research into the genetic regulation of flowering, seed development, dormancy induction and the bulbing process in this important crop. mining for molecular markers for flowering and fertility is of special interest, since their development will certainly advance our progress toward hybridization and seed propagation in garlic.

go classification in tissue-specific sulfur metabolism
garlic has a high content of organosulfur compounds, but little information is currently available on the molecular regulation of sulfur biosynthesis in this plant  <cit> . biosynthetic pathways of alliin precursors involve alkylation of the amino acid cysteine in glutathione, alkylation of cysteine or a precursor such as o-acetylserine. the regulatory complex of cysteine synthase is formed by the enzymes o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase -lyase  and serine acetyltransferase . these enzymes are at the branch point of the sulfur-, carbon-, and nitrogen-assimilation pathways  <cit> . in garlic, cysteine and glutathione metabolism occurs in parallel, and variation in metabolic routes depends on the physiological state of the tissue  <cit> .

using de novo assembly of the garlic transcriptome, we distinguished about  <dig> variants and isoforms of nine enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism in different organs of the garlic plant . isoforms of oass varied significantly in their distribution in the garlic organs . over-representation was notable in the cloves, roots, basal plate and leaves, whereas in the reproductive tissues, most of the annotated isoforms were less abundant. the isoforms were clustered into six groups, with clear expression patterns in the different organs. for instance, within cluster # <dig> , the three variants were enriched exclusively in cloves. the  <dig> variants and isoforms of sat were also differentially expressed in the six garlic organs , but organ clustering differed from that of oass.table  <dig>

numerous genes have been reported in the organosulfur biosynthesis pathways in garlic and onion. these include atp sulfurylase, sulfite reductase, cs, sat, glutamate cysteine ligase and glutathione synthase from garlic  <cit> , and ferredoxin-sulfite reductase , adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate reductase , oass, glutamylcysteine synthase, glutathione synthase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase from the onion bulb  <cit> . our transcriptome analysis suggests that in addition to a large repertoire of enzyme isoforms, the pathways of sulfur metabolism and translocation of organosulfur compounds between garlic organs are diverse: the cysteine sulfoxides are synthesized primarily in the leaves and roots, and are then translocated to the developing cloves. further and more intensive studies combining biochemistry and genetic regulation of these pathways may improve our understanding of alliin production and translocation in garlic and probably other allium plants.

go classification of garlic viruses
garlic crops suffer heavy losses due to viral infections and other pests, and elimination of these viruses is particularly difficult. moreover, due to the standard vegetative propagation of this crop, viruses are transmitted from one generation to the next  <cit> . the present transcriptome analysis was not designed to specifically search for garlic viruses. however, gene annotation revealed the presence of at least four known garlic allexiviruses: a, c, e and x. interestingly, we were unable to find transcripts similar to the most common and agriculturally significant potyviruses leek yellow stripe virus  and onion yellow dwarf virus  . in onion, iris yellow spot tospovirus  is not transmitted by seeds  <cit> , but it is not known whether potyviruses of garlic are. our experimental genotype # <dig> was propagated and grown from a single seed in an insect-proof screenhouse, isolated from garlic and onion fields. hence it might have been free of these viruses due to absence of inoculation. on the other hand, rather high amounts of the allexiviruses were identified in all tested organs, probably due to transmission via seeds. the highest amounts of viral rna were identified in the roots and cloves. in contrast, flowers expressed only 1–10% of the total viral rna amount, and the lowest number of reads  was found in the leaves . this new information on the distribution of allexiviruses among the various plant organs provides a solid basis for future research and development of effective detection methods. in practice, leaves are often sampled for viral infection. it is evident that, at least for garlic allexiviruses, such sampling might result in erroneous estimations of viral infection, due to the relatively low titer in this organ.table  <dig>

our initial results suggest that transcriptome tools provide more sensitive detection methods for new and known viruses in garlic, and shed new light on plant–pathogen interactions and virus distribution in plant tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
de-novo assembly of the transcriptome for fertile garlic provides a powerful tool for studying physiological, biochemical and genetic processes in garlic and other allium crops. the first organ-specific transcript catalogue was generated herein using relatively long reads , based on six labeled libraries from vegetative and reproductive tissues. we created two catalogues:  an extensive transcriptome consisting of  <dig>  sequences, and  an abundant transcriptome of  <dig>  contigs, which were annotated and analyzed for go and metabolic pathways. these datasets provide versatile resources for garlic genome research, and can be used to associate the transcriptome to developmental processes, understand the regulatory network of these processes, trace the expression profiles of individual genes, and identify reference genes for quantitative expression analyses in various organs and tissues. this tool is especially important in the elucidation of mechanisms of floral induction, micro- and megasporogenesis, male sterility and seed production in garlic. it will also be useful in the development of new methods for virus detection, as well as in the study of plant–pathogen interactions.

in the future, garlic “omics” studies will facilitate the development of user-friendly, efficient, transferable, and co-dominant markers such as snps, to be applied in current and future breeding programs. molecular assisted breeding applications will be used in the selection of genotypes with desired traits, produced from true seeds.
