BACKGROUND
non-genotoxic carcinogens are difficult to screen for as the development of tumours only occurs after long term exposure and, since there is no damage to dna, they cannot be detected by conventional genotoxicity assays such as the ames test, in vitro clastogenesis assays or the mouse micronucleus test. definitive characterization of non-genotoxic rat carcinogens requires the outcome of a two year bioassay. there are earlier indicators of hepatocarcinogenic potential which include increased liver weight, evidence of cytotoxicity, enzyme induction and car agonist activity which are used to aid dose setting for long term bioassays and in estimating risk. however, their predictive power is limited and complicated by the fact that non-genotoxic carcinogens represent a diverse range of mechanisms  <cit> .

phenobarbital  is a well characterized rodent non-genotoxic carcinogen which causes an increase in the incidence of liver tumors after long term exposure. this follows a reversible increase in liver weight, attributed to a combination of hyperplasia and hypertrophy  <cit> . in fischer f <dig> rats exposed to pb in the diet for two years, an increase in the incidence of neoplastic nodules was reported at a dose of  <dig> ppm  <cit> , with no changes observed at  <dig> or  <dig> ppm  <cit> . in another study rossi et al. found an increase in adenomas in wistar rats exposed to  <dig> ppm pb in drinking water following exposure for three years  <cit> . isenberg et al. reported that in f <dig> rats, exposure to  <dig> ppm pb in the diet for 1- <dig> weeks produces an increase in relative liver weight which is reversible on returning the animals to control diet. if the exposure is continued for  <dig> months, then a sustained increase in relative liver weight is observed. however, the increase in liver weight is only accompanied by a transient increase in dna synthesis, peaking at two weeks of exposure and no hepatic cancer  <cit> .

with the advent of global profiling approaches, including transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, there is now the opportunity to profile different levels of organization of a biological system in tissues and biofluids, thus aiding the understanding of mechanisms/modes of action and the identification of potential biomarkers of responses which reflect underlying pathophysiological perturbations. in addition these 'omic' approaches are hypotheses generating and are particularly appropriate for systems where the mechanism of toxicity is unknown or poorly defined  <cit> . furthermore, profiling a range of potential biomarkers may provide more sensitive or earlier indicators of pathological change.

in the present study a combination of metabolomics, transcriptomics and histology were used to identify changes occurring in the liver and plasma of fisher f <dig> rats during exposure to a range of doses of pb over a period of  <dig> days. the doses were selected to provide a low dose of  <dig> ppm which is non-carcinogenic and does not cause an increase in liver weight, a middle dose of  <dig> ppm which causes an increase in liver weight but is not carcinogenic and high dose of  <dig> ppm which is carcinogenic and causes an increase in liver weight. the integration of data from different 'omic' techniques presents a considerable challenge, but by combining datasets as part of a data fusion process, it is possible to produce information of greater value than that obtained from the individual datasets. this study demonstrates how this data fusion can be achieved in order to enhance understanding of the mechanisms involved in a toxic response.

RESULTS
liver and body weight
there was a significant increase in liver weight  in pb treated animals compared to controls  at all time points for  <dig> and  <dig> ppm. body weight was significantly increased in the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm groups at day  <dig> , reflecting an increase in the average food intake for the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm groups .

relative liver weight, body weight, ki <dig> labeling index and plasma clinical biochemistry data . all values are mean Â± standard deviation. * p <  <dig>  compared to time matched controls, ** p <  <dig>  compared to time matched controls.

histopathology
centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed in all dose groups. the incidence and time of onset were related to dose. on day  <dig>  only the mid dose  and high doses  were affected, whilst by day  <dig> the incidence had risen to 3/ <dig> at  <dig> ppm, 5/ <dig> at  <dig> ppm and  <dig> ppm. electron microscopy confirmed the hypertrophy to reflect smooth endoplasmic reticulum proliferation .

clinical chemistry
significant changes in plasma clinical chemistry were only detected with the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm dose groups, with the exception of glutamate dehydrogenase where changes were also detected for the  <dig> ppm dose group. plasma cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase activity were increased on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  triglycerides were decreased on day  <dig> and glutamate dehydrogenase was increased at day  <dig>  total protein was increased on days  <dig> and  <dig> .

labeling index 
at day  <dig> the ki <dig> labeling indices were statistically significantly increased by doses of  <dig>  and  <dig> ppm  . there was no change in the labeling index at other time points.

metabolomic analysis of liver tissue
principal components analysis  of the 1h nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy dataset from all time points combined demonstrated some separation according to dose . however, analysis of individual time points using pca demonstrated separation between the different dose groups which was improved by using partial least squares  to regress metabolic profile against dose of pb . the largest change associated with these pls plots was a dose dependent decrease in glucose and glycogen at all time points in rats exposed to pb. there was also an increase in succinate and a decrease in adenosine with increasing dose of pb at all time points. at days 1- <dig>  pb caused an increase in glutamine and glutathione .

q <dig> values for pls models using data from different platforms and at different time points. the q <dig> is a measure of how robust a model is, scored out of  <dig>  with higher values indicating a better model. the number in brackets is number of components in the model.

at each time point pca of the data produced by gc-ms  analysis of the aqueous phase separated the different doses of pb, although at days  <dig> and  <dig> the  <dig> ppm dose group could not be separated from the control group. the same trend was also detected using pls to regress metabolic profile against dose with improved separation . pb caused an increase in succinate and glycine at all time points and 5-oxoproline at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  disaccharides, ethanolamine and fructose were also all decreased by pb at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and ribose was decreased at days  <dig> and  <dig> .

fold changes in expression for selected genes. * p <  <dig>  compared to time matched controls, ** p <  <dig>  compared to time matched controls.

while there was no dose dependent trend in the data from the lipid fraction detected by pca or pls at day  <dig>  at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> there was separation according to dose with the same trend being detected at each time point. by pca there was some separation between the control and  <dig> ppm groups and the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm groups which was increased by pls but the control group and  <dig> ppm dose group were still poorly discriminated, as were the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm dose groups . these models determined that pb caused an increase in oleic acid at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and an increase in cis- <dig> , <dig> ,17-eicosapentaenoic acid at days  <dig> and  <dig>  at days  <dig> and  <dig> pb caused a decrease in arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and pentadecanoic acid . the pls models built for each technique and time point all passed cross-validation either in terms of predicting the dose of pb during a leave-one-out analysis  or during a random permutation test for dose .

high resolution magic angle spinning 1h nmr analysis of liver tissue
following the observation that pb exposure decreased the glucose and glycogen content of the liver, we hypothesized pb alters the ratio of mobile cytosolic lipid to carbohydrate in the liver. high resolution magic angle spinning  nmr spectroscopy is a technique which allows the acquisition of high resolution nmr spectra from solid tissue samples, and was conducted on intact liver samples from day  <dig> to determine if the ratio of lipid to carbohydrate in the liver was changed by pb exposure. pls separated the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm groups from the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm groups  . the loadings showed that resonances corresponding to the fatty acids and choline groups of lipids were increased with increasing dose of pb, whereas resonances from glucose and glycogen were decreased with increasing dose of pb . the ratio of total fat to total carbohydrate increased by 103% and 134% for the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm groups, respectively  .

metabolic profiling of plasma
pca of data from individual time points from the 1h-nmr spectroscopy of the blood plasma samples separated the control and  <dig> ppm dose groups from the  <dig> and  <dig> ppm dose groups for all time points after day  <dig>  with this separation becoming more pronounced at  <dig> and  <dig> days . the concentrations of valine, lactate, glutamate and glutamine were increased by pb exposure at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  similarly, the concentrations of isoleucine, leucine acetate and choline/phosphocholine were increased at days  <dig> and  <dig>  pb caused a decrease in plasma lipid which was more pronounced at later time points . the broad resonance corresponding to the terminal methyl groups of fatty acids changed in shape with an increase in the  <dig> - <dig>  ppm region and decrease in the  <dig> - <dig>  ppm region , reflecting an increase in the fraction of higher density lipoproteins  <cit> .

gene expression profiling of liver
phenobarbital induced changes in the expression of  <dig> probesets. hierarchical clustering using pearson correlation coefficients revealed a complex temporal and dose-dependent pattern . some genes were clearly upregulated transiently at early time points , whereas others showed persistent down- or up-regulation . those genes showing transient increases in expression were over-represented in gene ontology, kegg and genmapp annotations associated with the proteosome, starch and sucrose metabolism and the cell cycle. those genes that have sustained alterations in expression were over-represented in genes with annotations including control of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and xenobiotic metabolism .

integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data
two approaches were taken to integrate the data generated by metabolomic and genomic analyses. firstly, significant changes in gene expression were mapped on to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  metabolic pathways using genespring . this allowed the identification of pathways where both the expression of transcripts and concentration of metabolites were altered by pb. in this way an association between the decrease in hepatic glycogen and a decrease in glucokinase  on the glycogen synthesis pathway was identified . this approach also identified a perturbation of glutathione metabolism in response to pb. glutathione, glutamine, glycine and 5-oxo-proline were all increased by pb exposure. glutamine cysteine ligase and glutathione reductase expression were increased whereas glutamine synthetase expression was decreased .

in the second approach, pls was used to build regression models using the genomic data as the x block and the normalized integrated areas of peaks corresponding to individual metabolites as the y variable. in many cases an association was identified between pb induced metabolic changes, metabolizing enzymes, and enzymes involved with protecting against damage from oxidative stress. epoxide hydrolase, glutathione s-transferase, glutathione reductase, cytochrome p <dig> 2b <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> 3a <dig>  aldehyde dehydrogenase and udp-glucuronosyltransferase were all induced by pb . however, in the case of the increase in succinate detected at each time point by both gc-ms and 1h-nmr, the enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase  was found to correlate with hepatic succinate . pls also identified a correlation between decreased plasma lipids and increased hepatic lipoprotein lipase  at days  <dig> and  <dig>  and confirmed the association between decreased in glucokinase expression and decreased hepatic glycogen.

pb induced remodeling of lipids
gc-ms can only provide information about the total fatty acid content of a sample, as information about the lipid species which originally contained the fatty acids is lost in the derivatisation procedure. direct infusion esi-ms was used to profile intact lipid species and this technique identified many changes in response to pb . using a perl script the data was summarised in terms of a particular fatty acid or lipid class that had changed in the multivariate analysis of the data. in the presentation of the data it was not possible to determine definitively the position of the double bonds within given fatty acids by di-esi and so they are defined in terms of the number of carbons and degree of desaturation within the fatty acid, while presumed names are given in parentheses. however, where assignment was possible the name is given first.

considering the free fatty acids, monoacylphospholipids and diacylphospholipids together there was a decrease in arachidonic acid  containing species at all time points. gpetn and gpcho species were decreased at all time points and gpins species were increased at all time points . there were also smaller decreases in species containing palmitic acid  at days  <dig> and  <dig> and 22: <dig>  at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . many changes were observed in the free fatty acids detected by direct infusion esi-ms. stearic acid , oleic acid , 18: <dig>  20: <dig> and 20: <dig>  were all increased by pb at all time points and arachidic acid , 22: <dig> and 22: <dig> were decreased at all time points. despite decreases in docosahexaenoic acid  and arachidonic acid  in the total lipid content as measured by gc-ms and direct infusion esi-ms, no significant changes were seen for22: <dig>  as the free fatty acid, and 20: <dig>  free fatty acid was only significantly decreased on day  <dig>  however, decreases in diacylphospholipids containing these fatty acids were observed .

values are given as: total . for example, at day  <dig> eighteen species containing 16: <dig> were decreased with increasing dose of pb and this can be broken down into the free fatty acid,  <dig> monoacylphospholipids and  <dig> diacylphospholipids .

direct infusion esi-ms showed that species containing stearic acid  and palmitic acid  were generally increased by exposure to pb. the exceptions were if they were in combination with a highly unsaturated fatty acid , especially 20: <dig> , docosahexaenoic acid 22: <dig>  or 22: <dig>  when they tended to be decreased . the only gpins species that were decreased were those containing arachidonic acid . most gpcho and gpetn lipids were decreased across all time points. those gpcho and gpetn species which increased all contained stearic acid  .

discussion
in this study we have examined the well characterized non genotoxic carcinogen pb to investigate whether a combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approach could identify early stage mechanistic markers associated with pb toxicity. to confirm that pb was producing the effects reported previously, we measured a number of classical parameters. dietary administration of pb resulted in an increase in relative liver weight , centrilobular hypertrophy  and a transient increase in cell replication , all of which are in accordance with the literature  <cit> . both metabolomics and transcriptomics identified changes in liver metabolism after just one day of exposure to pb demonstrating the sensitivity of this approach. many metabolites were identified as having altered in both liver and plasma and in order to aid interpretation of these results, metabolite and transcript data were integrated highlighting several pathways which had been perturbed by pb.

hepatic glycogen
a large, dose dependent decrease in the amount of glycogen in the livers of the animals given pb was observed at all time points. both direct mapping of changes in gene expression onto the pathways and pls regression between transcriptional and metabolomic data identified a decrease in glucokinase as being correlated with the decrease in glycogen. glucokinase catalyses the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and is involved in controlling the rate of glycogen synthesis and glycolysis  <cit> . this indicates that the decrease in glycogen detected in the livers of animals exposed to pb is a result of a decrease in glycogen synthesis, with this previously being reported in vitro in isolated rat hepatocytes  <cit> .

hepatic glutathione
hepatic glutathione was increased at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in animals exposed to pb relative to control animals. this was accompanied by an increase in the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione, at days  <dig> and  <dig> in animals exposed to pb. there are mixed reports as to whether pb exposure increases glutathione  <cit> , but in this study the combined transcriptomic and metabolomic data indicates pb increased hepatic glutathione by an increase in synthesis. the majority of Î³-glutamylcysteine is converted to glutathione by glutathione synthase, but a small amount is converted to 5-oxoproline and cysteine by Î³-glutamylcyclotransferase  <cit>  . the proportions of Î³-glutamylcysteine being metabolized by each path is controlled by the kinetics of the two enzymes, and thus, the detected increase in 5-oxoproline with pb dose suggests that flux through both pathways has increased.

glutathione reductase expression was increased for animals in the mid and high dose groups at all time points. this enzyme reduces oxidized glutathione back to reduced glutathione in a nadph dependent reaction and provides an important anti-oxidative stress mechanism in the liver. a number of mechanisms generate nadph for this conversion, including the conversion of malate to pyruvate catalyzed by malic enzyme. the expression of malic enzyme is highly correlated with glutathione reductase expression , suggesting that the increase in malic enzyme expression is due to increased demand for reducing power which is associated with drug metabolism and pb exposure  <cit> .

hepatic succinate
the increase in hepatic succinate caused by exposure to pb could have been caused by alterations in a number of different pathways, including increased tca rate and increased reducing potential demand by the liver cells. however, using our combined metabolomic and transcriptomic approach we demonstrate that succinate is correlated with the increased expression of alas. this enzyme catalyses the reaction between glycine and succinyl coa to form 5-aminolevulinate, in the first committed step in heme biosynthesis  <cit>  and pb induces alas in isolated hepatocytes  <cit> . pb induces the cyp2b family of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and hence the increase in heme biosynthesis induced by pb is consistent with the heme requirements associated with induction of cytochrome p450s  <cit> .

plasma lipids
clinical biochemistry measurements showed a decrease in plasma triglycerides in animals given the mid and high doses of pb at day  <dig> and 1h-nmr of plasma also showed a decrease in lipid resonances at days  <dig> and  <dig>  pls demonstrated a correlation between the ch <dig> resonance of plasma lipoproteins and lpl expression. lpl is not normally expressed in liver tissue of adult rats. however, it is expressed in the livers of neonatal rats and its expression can be induced in adult rats, for example by the ppar agonist fenofibrate  <cit> . lpl is found in the endothelial cells lining capillaries of tissues and hydrolyses triglycerides from lipoproteins circulating in the plasma to release fatty acids which can be taken up by the tissue. its induction in the liver of rats exposed to pb may be responsible for the decrease in plasma lipids, suggesting that the liver in these animals has an increased demand for fatty acids, possibly due to the proliferation in endoplasmic reticulum which is known to be induced by pb  <cit> .

high resolution 1h-nmr spectroscopic analysis of plasma demonstrated differences in the lipoprotein fraction with increasing pb dose. there is a subtle decrease in chemical shift as the density of the lipoproteins decreases and this affects the shape of the lipid peaks detected in blood plasma  <cit> . at day  <dig>  spectra from rats exposed to pb demonstrated a shift in the terminal methyl lipoprotein resonance to a lower chemical shift reflecting an increase in high density lipoprotein and decrease in low density lipoprotein as has been reported in pb-exposed sprague dawley rats  <cit> .

lipid remodeling in the liver
the decrease in glycogen and increase in fatty acid uptake in response to pb suggested that the proportions of fat and carbohydrate in the liver were altered. hrmas 1h-nmr spectroscopy was used to study liver tissue from day  <dig> and demonstrated a clear increase in the ratio of lipid to carbohydrate in rats exposed to  <dig> and  <dig> ppm pb. 1h-nmr showed a large, dose dependent decrease in the levels of hepatic glucose and glycogen at all time points. expression of lipoprotein lipase was increased in the high dose groups from day  <dig>  and this is also the time point at which changes in the lipid species present were first detected by gc-ms. because of the relative low spinning speeds used during hrmas 1h nmr spectroscopy, the technique focuses on the detection of lipids with some mobility, and hence the increased lipid detected in the spectra reflect the mobilization of triglyceride stores within the liver tissue.

direct infusion mass spectrometry provided an important tool for rationalising the total lipid changes detected by gc-ms and hrmas 1h nmr spectroscopy. the lipid changes were characterised by a global increase in gpins apart from those containing hufas, while most gpcho and gpetn species were decreased. the synthesis of glycerophospholipids is complex. gpins and gpser are both synthesized from cdp-dag, while gpetn is synthesized from the decarboxylation of gpser. gpcho is synthesized either from gpser by sequential methylation by phosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase and s-adenosylmethionine or direct from cdpcholine and dag via cdp-choline: <dig> -diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. in addition cdpethanolamine and dag are also precursors to gpeth. in mammals this remodelling of glycerophopsholipids largely takes place in the er . pb induces proliferation of the er, and while the key enzymes involved in the synthesis of gpins, gpetn and gpcho are all found within the er, in the present study pb selectively increased the concentration of gpins, while other phospholipids largely decreased in concentration. this suggests pb exposure induces a remodelling of cellular lipids, which may in turn relate to the biochemical changes associated with pathological er proliferation and the need to synthesize particular phospholipids for membrane synthesis.

omic techniques
in this study the use of metabolomics and transcriptomics has allowed the detection of many changes occurring in response to pb using a small set of experiments and without predefined hypotheses. this is the first time that metabolomics and transcriptomics have been used in combination to study the effects of pb exposure and the published data available has been used to validate the approach. this ability of omic techniques to identify changes occurring across many metabolic pathways and in different tissues and biofluids, without the need for a large number of targeted analyses, is one of the technology's key benefits and is well demonstrated in this work. in addition, the transcriptomic data strengthened the metabolomic data by improving the interpretability of the metabolic changes. it was possible to determine if a decrease in synthesis or an increase in degradation was the cause of the decrease in the concentration of a metabolite  and the cause of changes in metabolites which lie on many pathways were also identified . the transcriptomic data is enhanced by metabolomic data as changes in gene expression do not necessarily imply changes in levels of enzymes and metabolite and as not all proteins are under transcriptional control, gene expression profiling can miss large changes which can be detected with metabolomics  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have used a combined omic platform to investigate early stage mechanistic biomarkers associated with exposure to the classic rodent non-genotoxic carcinogen pb. the use of metabolomics and transcriptomics in combination greatly enhanced the conclusions which could be drawn from the dataset by aiding the interpretation of metabolomic data and by linking changes in gene expression to measured changes in metabolism. data available on this compound has allowed us to confirm our findings and interpretation, validating the use of this approach for the study of less well characterized compounds. pathway perturbations included those associated with glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, glutathione metabolism and heme synthesis. furthermore, the approach was capable of identifying diverse mechanistic responses, even for metabolites like succinate which form a central hub in metabolism where a number of pathways converge. this study has shown the sensitivity of 'omic technologies to identify many perturbations without a predefined hypothesis, providing early stage markers of the subsequent pathophysiology.
