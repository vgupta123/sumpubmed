BACKGROUND
most mammalian orthologues of the drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential  channel are involved in regulated transmembrane ca2+ fluxes either because they are directly permeable to ca2+ or because they are permeable to na+ and therefore indirectly affect intracellular ca2+  <cit> . trpc <dig> was the first of the mammalian trp channels to be cloned and has been found to be widely expressed throughout the body  <cit> . there is general agreement that it contributes to ca2+ and na+ entry but it should be appreciated that its functions often depend on heteromultimerisation with other trp proteins or regulators  <cit> . trpc <dig> and its associated trpc channels are not voltage-gated ion channels but relatively slow chemically-modulated channels. activation by depletion of ca2+ stores has been described but there is also stimulation by agonists of g protein-coupled receptors, oxidized phospholipids  <cit>  and redox factors  <cit> . important functions of trpc <dig> have been indicated in many mammalian systems, including in cell hypertrophy, migration and proliferation  <cit> . in the cardiovascular system trpc <dig> stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell  hypertrophy and hyperplasia  <cit>  as well as cardiac hypertrophy evoked by aortic constriction  <cit> . furthermore, it is up-regulated in response to vascular injury  <cit>  and metabolic syndrome  <cit>  and down-regulated by exercise  <cit> , consistent with it playing important roles in pathological cardiovascular remodelling.

relatively little is known about the control of trpc <dig> gene expression other than that there is regulation by nfκb, hif- <dig> and ca2+  <cit> . splice variation of trpc <dig> transcripts has been reported but there has been little investigation of the topic and so the extent and importance are unknown. one variant corresponded to  <dig> exons but other variants lacked one or both of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  and thus contained only  <dig> or  <dig> exons  <cit> . other variants, some with additional exonic sequences, have been suggested  <cit> .

nonsense-mediated decay  is a major rna surveillance mechanism, degrading mrnas that contain premature termination codons  in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . increasingly nmd is suggested to play roles in suppressing human diseases  <cit> . the first step in nmd involves attachment of an exon-junction complex 5' of exon-exon junctions during splicing in the nucleus. if mrna lacks ptcs, exon-junction complexes are stripped during the first round of translation by the ribosome. however, the exon-junction complex recruits nmd factors if ptcs are detected at least  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the final exon-exon junction. decapping and degradation of such transcripts then follows. a key nmd factor is the phosphoprotein up-frameshift- <dig> . decay of ptc-containing rnas occurs when upf <dig> interacts with upf <dig> and upf <dig>  <cit> . although originally thought only to be a system for degrading aberrantly spliced transcripts, nmd and alternative splicing can couple together in a process termed regulated unproductive splicing and translation  <cit> . nmd has been suggested to be important in genetic cardiomyopathies  <cit>  but, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information on the relevance to trp channels, vsmcs, or vascular remodelling.

in this study we made a survey of splicing in human trpc <dig> gene transcripts and investigated the potential relevance. the investigation primarily focused on proliferating human saphenous vein vsmcs obtained during coronary artery bypass graft surgery. hyperplasia in these vsmcs is a key determinant of long-term failure of saphenous vein bypass grafts  <cit> . human brain and aorta mrna libraries and human embryonic kidney   <dig> cells were used for comparison.

RESULTS
 <dig>  multiple trpc <dig> transcripts containing premature termination codons 
a segmental rt-pcr scan was performed based on the predicted exonic structure of trpc <dig> gene using human brain mrna as a template. pcr primers spanning from exon  <dig> to  <dig> most noticeably amplified transcript lacking exon  <dig> . a smaller product lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig> was also evident . primers spanning exon  <dig> to  <dig> revealed products lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig>  or  <dig> alone . in contrast, exon 9- <dig> pcr revealed only one full-length product, indicating absence of alternative splicing in this segment . parallel reactions performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase yielded no products, confirming that bands shown in figure  <dig> arose from mrna . for each primer pair, pcr was also performed using recombinant trpc <dig> cdna clone as a template control. the clone contained exons 1- <dig> and 4- <dig>  and no intronic structure. pcr reactions on the clone revealed only single products, showing that the additional products from mrna did not arise because of mis-priming on a single trpc <dig> template .

more detailed investigation was performed by using pcr primers spanning from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> followed by sub-cloning and dna sequencing of pcr products. full-length transcript was evident but there were also smaller products. an example of the gel analysis is shown for human brain mrna . the approach was also applied to mrna from hek  <dig> cells, human saphenous vein, and human aorta. in each case, reactions of the type shown in figure 1d were investigated by sub-cloning and sequencing to provide insight into the scope and characteristics of the splice variants. the experiments showed that multiple novel trpc <dig> transcripts could be detected, including deletions of exons 2- <dig> and 5- <dig> . frame-shift and premature termination codon  insertion in exon  <dig> was observed to occur through deletion of exons  <dig> and  <dig> . in one clone, a novel 98-bp exon  was observed with exon hallmarks ending in the cag nucleotide sequence and having exon boundaries delineated by intronic ag acceptor and gc donor sites . although inclusion of exon 3a conferred a ptc it was made redundant by prior deletion of exon  <dig>  resulting in a frame-shift in exon  <dig> 

we did not attempt to define all splice variants or provide statistical analysis of the frequency of each variant but the data sample summarised in figure 3a supports the conclusion that there is extensive splicing in trpc <dig> transcripts. out of the variants analysed, exons  <dig>   <dig> and 5- <dig> were omitted cassette exons whereas exon  <dig> was always present and thus constitutively spliced . transcripts contained frame-shifts that led to ptcs in or before exon  <dig> except in one case from human aorta where there was an in-frame deletion of  <dig> bp corresponding to the last half of exon  <dig> . in figure 3b the exons are aligned approximately with the six predicted transmembrane segments  and ion pore region  of the trpc <dig> protein, showing that the insertion of ptcs will affect the transmembrane integrity and ion pore of the trpc <dig> protein. overall, the data suggest that ptc-containing variants are varied and complex, including in human blood vessels, and that they are likely to have negative effects on the generation and function of trpc <dig> protein.

 <dig>  cell type-dependent nonsense-mediated decay : low efficiency at trpc <dig> transcripts in vsmcs
because nmd depends on first round translation it is acutely sensitive to cycloheximide, which inhibits peptidyl transferase activity of the 60s ribosomal subunit  <cit> . therefore, to investigate the relevance of nmd, trpc <dig> transcripts were investigated in cells after  <dig> hr treatment with cycloheximide or vehicle control using pcr primer pairs spanning from exon  <dig> to  <dig>  in hek  <dig> cells, cycloheximide increased the abundance of trpc <dig> transcripts that had deletions of exons  <dig> and  <dig>   or deletion of exons  <dig>   <dig> and 5- <dig> . cycloheximide had no effect on the abundance of the 'house-keeper' mrna that encoded β-actin . in contrast, in human saphenous vein vsmcs cycloheximide had no effect on trpc <dig> transcripts . moreover, under basal conditions  the abundance of the trpc <dig> Δ <dig>  variant was apparently greater in vsmcs compared with hek  <dig> cells . this difference was also detected when comparing hek  <dig> cell mrna with mrna from human aorta or human saphenous vein .

efforts were made to develop intra-exon pcr primers to enable real-time pcr quantification of exon expression. unfortunately, because of the small size of the exons, we were only successful with intra-exon  <dig> primers, which target a constitutively spliced exon that was not different between samples . we also note that the data of figure 4a-c revealed pcr products in addition to those identified as Δ <dig> or Δ <dig>  and which are unmarked in the figure panels. the sequences of these products were not determined. the abundance of these other pcr products may have decreased with increasing abundance of the Δ <dig>  variant  because they were out-competed in the multiple pcr reactions occurring within the single tube.

the data are consistent with the degradation of ptc-containing trpc <dig> variants via the nmd pathway in hek  <dig> cells but absence  of such a mechanism in vsmcs.

 <dig>  low upf <dig> in vsmcs
a possible explanation for the absence or inefficiency of nmd in the vsmcs is paucity of a key component of the nmd machinery such as upf proteins. analysis of mrna species encoding up-frameshift  proteins revealed clear expression of upf <dig>  upf <dig> and upf3b in hek  <dig> cells . in contrast in vsmcs, mrnas encoding upf <dig> and upf3b were readily detected but mrna encoding upf <dig> was difficult to detect . the example experiment indicates a small amount of upf <dig> mrna  but quantitative real-time pcr measurement was not possible because the mrna species was undetectable in most samples .

protein abundance may be preserved by low protein turn-over in the face of low mrna expression. therefore, upf <dig> protein was analysed by western blotting. anti-upf <dig> antibody labelled protein of the expected mass for upf <dig>   <dig> kda . two other anti-upf <dig> antibodies labelled protein of the same size . to determine upf <dig> abundance, equal amounts of total protein were loaded from hek  <dig> and vsmc lysates. although upf <dig> was evident in vsmcs, its abundance was  <dig>  times less compared with hek  <dig> cells .

the data suggest that vsmcs have very low mrna and relatively low protein abundance of upf <dig>  a critical component of the nmd mechanism.

 <dig>  effect of upf <dig> rescue on vsmc proliferation
previous studies have suggested that nmd is important as a suppressor of human diseases  <cit> . coronary artery bypass grafts are carried out because individuals have coronary artery disease. the saphenous veins of these patients are prone to neointimal hyperplasia. therefore, we hypothesised that a net effect of low upf <dig> abundance may be to enhance proliferation of saphenous vein vsmcs. vsmcs were compared after transfection with control vector or vector expressing human upf <dig> to rescue upf <dig> levels. upf <dig> suppressed vsmc proliferation .

the data suggest that low upf <dig> and nmd in vsmcs stimulate cell proliferation and that the effect can be protected against by expression of exogenous upf <dig> 

 <dig>  function of trpc <dig> Δ <dig> 
protein encoded by the Δ <dig>  deletion is predicted to comprise only the first two membrane-spanning segments of trpc <dig> . the variant is susceptible to nmd in hek  <dig> cells where it has low abundance , but in vsmcs  there is significant mrna encoding the variant . to investigate if the variant has capability to be functional we generated it in a mammalian expression vector and transfected hek  <dig> cells because these cells have low endogenous expression of the variant. because trpc <dig> is associated with ca2+ entry, the amplitude of ca2+-entry was investigated in two paired sets of experiments: one comparing dna vector with vector expressing the Δ <dig>  variant; and the other comparing the dna vector with vector expressing wild-type trpc <dig>  it was observed that the Δ <dig>  variant partly inhibited ca2+ entry where as wild-type trpc <dig> increased it .

the data suggest that short trpc <dig> variants  have an effect on ca2+-entry that is opposite to that of wild-type trpc <dig>  causing inhibition.

 <dig>  discussion
the data add to existing knowledge of alternative splicing in trpc <dig> transcripts, showing that the splicing is extensive and commonly leads to frame-shifts with ptcs. these ptc variants are susceptible to nmd and may have no functional consequence unless nmd is compromised. intriguingly, compromised nmd has previously been suggested in disease conditions and we observed weak or non-existent nmd in vsmcs from patients with coronary artery disease. furthermore, we were able to show that weak nmd was associated with low expression of upf <dig>  a key protein of the nmd machinery. therefore, although aberrant trpc <dig> transcripts presumably reflect only a tiny fraction of the total aberrant variants of all genes in the cells, study of trpc <dig> has led us to investigation of nmd and upf <dig> in the vasculature and the first suggestion that they are relevant to unwanted vascular remodelling.

there is relatively little prior evidence that expression of upf <dig> varies across cell types or changes in disease. higher upf <dig> mrna abundance was detected in mouse testis but no differential expression was detected across a range of other physiological murine tissues  <cit> . variation in expression of other nmd components occurred however, and up to 2-fold difference in nmd efficiency was suggested  <cit> . upf <dig> is also a phosphoprotein and so its activity, rather than expression, may be a source of variation  <cit> . stress factors such as reactive oxygen species may also inhibit nmd  <cit> . nevertheless, as far as we are aware, our data provide the first evidence for markedly lower upf <dig> mrna and relatively low upf <dig> protein in a cell or tissue type. our data suggest that efficient nmd requires a certain abundance of upf <dig> because the protein was not completely absent from vsmcs. it may be important that upf <dig> was not completely absent because knock-out of the mouse gene  is embryonically lethal  <cit>  and strong knock-down of upf <dig> arrests hela cells in s phase  <cit> . it would, therefore, seem that mammalian cells require upf1/upf <dig>  the origin and condition of the vein and vsmcs used in our experiments may have been influential because the cells of these veins will have been under stress in the patient and are particularly prone to proliferative and migratory behaviour, which is why there is a significant problem with subsequent neointimal hyperplasia  <cit> . our data suggest that a previously unrecognised contributory factor in the aberrant proliferative behaviour may be compromised nmd due, at least in part, to low upf <dig> expression. consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to show that elevation  of upf <dig> suppressed proliferation in vsmcs.

short, n-terminal, variants of other trp channel types have been described, including for trpc <dig>  <cit> , trpc <dig>  <cit> , trpm <dig>  <cit>  and trpm <dig>  <cit> . each variant is inhibitory for ca2+-entry, as we describe for the Δ <dig>   variant of trpc <dig>  therefore, it may be a common theme in trp channels that there are inhibitory n-terminal variants that are variably expressed depending on activities of the spliceosome and nmd. however, it should be noted that although we showed native expression of Δ <dig>  mrna and other ptc-containing variants, we did not show that the variants led to proteins. detection of endogenous ion channel proteins is notoriously difficult and the difficulty increases with splice variants that have even lower abundance. few studies provide convincing evidence for native expression of such variants but instead show effects of heterologously over-expressed constructs. with a view to detecting endogenous variants we generated an anti-trpc <dig> antibody targeted to amino acid sequence encoded by exon  <dig> . unfortunately, the antibody recognised over-expressed trpc <dig> but lacked sufficient specificity to definitively identify short forms of endogenous trpc <dig>  therefore, we cannot be sure that such short trpc <dig> proteins exist in vsmcs even though we know the nmd mechanism is inefficient at trpc <dig> transcripts and the mrna species are present. if short trpc <dig> proteins do exist endogenously they would be expected to suppress trpc1-dependent ca2+ entry and consequently also vsmc proliferation  <cit> . this prediction may seem at odds with the observation that upf <dig> suppressed cell proliferation . nevertheless, it should be appreciated that consideration of upf <dig> and nmd only in relation to trpc <dig> would be unjustifiably restrictive; many aberrant splice variants are removed by nmd and it is the collective effect that will determine the net consequence on cell proliferation.

CONCLUSIONS
the first half of this study identified extensive alternative splicing of trpc <dig> transcripts that results in ptc-containing variants which are susceptible to nmd. these observations led us to find that nmd is weak or absent in proliferating vsmcs. our data suggest that the weak nmd arises because of down-regulated expression of upf <dig> and that rescue of upf <dig> suppresses vsmc proliferation, a primary factor in the neointimal hyperplasia that leads to failure of veins as bypass grafts. we therefore suggest that inefficient nmd and down-regulated upf <dig> are previously unrecognised features of human vsmc remodelling that result in unwanted transcripts with adverse effects. the findings support and expand previous suggestions that nmd plays a role in suppressing human diseases  <cit> .

 <dig>  methods
 <dig>  saphenous vein and cell culture
freshly discarded human saphenous vein segments were obtained anonymously and with informed consent from patients undergoing open heart surgery in the general infirmary at leeds. approval was granted by the leeds teaching hospitals local research ethics committee. the investigation conforms to principles outlined in the declaration of helsinki. transfer of vein to the laboratory occurred in chilled dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  and the processing of the vein for experiments occurred within 30- <dig> min after removal of the vein from the patient. vsmcs were prepared using an explant technique and grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum , penicillin/streptomycin and l-glutamine at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. experiments were performed on cells passaged 2- <dig> times. staining of cells positively for smooth muscle α-actin and smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain confirmed vsmc identity. hek  <dig> cells were grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium-f <dig> media  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin  and streptomycin  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. for cycloheximide  treatment, cells were grown to 60% confluency and treated with  <dig> μg/ml chx or the vehicle control  for  <dig> hr. cells were washed with pbs before harvesting rna.

 <dig>  rna isolation and rt-pcr
saphenous vein was placed in hanks' solution , the medial layer dissected and snap-frozen immediately. human brain total rna and human aorta total rna were purchased from ambion . messenger rna was isolated using tri-reagent  and subjected to dnase i digestion ; 1- <dig> μg was reverse transcribed using oligo dt or a trpc <dig> gene specific primer with amv-rt  or transcriptor . omitting reverse transcriptase controlled for the presence of genomic dna. thermal cycling was 95°c ,  <dig> cycles  at 94°c , 55°c , and 72°c . pcr product  was mixed with  <dig> μl loading buffer  and resolved alongside appropriate dna markers on 2% agarose-tae gel containing ethidium bromide. gels were deliberately loaded heavily with pcr product in order to reveal the lower abundance splice products. therefore, high abundance products appear over-loaded. bands were excised from gels and directly sequenced  or pcr products were subcloned using the topo ta system  and resulting colonies sequenced using gene-specific or m <dig> primers.

 <dig>  real-time quantitative pcr
real-time rt-pcr cdna was quantified using the roche lightcycler ii system and lightcycler faststart dna master sybr green i . the total rna input into each reaction was constant. total rna abundance was quantified by ribogreen assays  using the fluorimeter function of the lightcycler. dna was amplified using the following protocol: hot-start at 95°c ;  <dig> cycles of 95°c , 55°c  and 72°c . as previously described  <cit> , pcr crossing points  were determined using fit-points methodology  and rna relative abundance calculated using 2cp /2cp . cp values for β-actin were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . as appropriate, there was adherence to published guidelines for quantitative rt-pcr  <cit> .

 <dig>  pcr primers

 <dig>  western blotting
confluent monolayers of vsmcs and hek  <dig> cells were harvested in lysis buffer  containing protease inhibitors . for detection of upf <dig>  cell lysates were cleared by  <dig> min centrifugation at  <dig> × g and protein concentration in the supernatants estimated by the biorad dc protein assay. equal amounts of protein  were loaded and resolved by gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk in  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm tris, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> % tween- <dig> and incubated  with an antibody against human upf <dig>   <cit> . hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody  and supersignal picowest substrate  were used for detection. blots were also probed with an antibody against β-actin  followed by hrp-conjugated bovine anti-mouse antibodies , but β-actin was found to be differentially expressed between hek  <dig> cells and vsmcs. normalisation of upf <dig> abundance relative to β-actin yield a qualitatively similar result to that obtained by normalizing to total protein . expression of upf <dig> protein was also confirmed using anti-rent <dig> antibody  and an antibody against human upf <dig> .

 <dig>  generation of Δ <dig>  trpc1
trpc1-Δ <dig>   was engineered by deletion pcr using as the template human trpc <dig>  in pires-eyfp  and a primer pair designed to anneal to the 3' end of exon  <dig> and the 5' end of exon 10: tattctgtggattattgatttcaatgggacagatg  and tctgtcccattgaaatcaataatccacagaataag . pcr conditions were 95°c , then for  <dig> cycles, 95°c , 55°c  and 68°c . the resulting construct was sequenced to confirm identity.

 <dig>  ca2+ imaging
cells were transfected with htrpc1-pires eyfp or htrpc1Δ <dig> -pires eyfp  using lipofectamine  <dig> . cells were split onto coverslips, and used for experiments 48- <dig> hr later. cells were pre-incubated with  <dig> μm of fura pe3-am  at 37°c for  <dig> hr in standard bath solution , followed by  <dig> min wash period in sbs containing  <dig> μm thapsigargin. recordings were made alternately from test and control cells. fluorescence was observed with an inverted microscope , and a xenon arc lamp provided excitation light, the wavelength of which was selected by a monochromator . experiments were performed at room temperature and emission was collected via a 510-nm filter and sampled by a ccd camera . images were sampled every  <dig> s at  <dig> and  <dig> nm and analysed off-line using regions of interest to select individual cells. i is expressed as the ratio of the emission intensities for  <dig> and  <dig> nm . imaging was controlled by openlab software .

 <dig>  cell proliferation and transfection with hupf <dig> cdna
vsmcs from human saphenous vein were transfected with cdna encoding human upf <dig>  or control vector using the basic amaxa protocol for primary smooth muscle cells . briefly, cells from confluent t <dig> flasks  were released by detachin , pelleted and resuspended in basic nucleofector solution . equal numbers of cells from each patient were transfected with  <dig> μg/ <dig> μl of hupf <dig> in pci-neo ha vector or empty vector using amaxa electroporation system. cells were plated onto 6-well plates with pre-warmed medium. after  <dig> days in dmem supplemented with 10% fcs, cells were washed and harvested in detachin. viable cells were identified by trypan blue exclusion and randomised samples were counted in a blinded fashion to assess proliferation. vsmc samples derived from  <dig> patients were used in the experiment and for each sample the effect on proliferation was determined from the ratio between number of cells that had been transfected with upf <dig> and the control dna.

 <dig>  data analysis
mean data are shown as mean ± s.e.mean. statistical comparisons were made using student's t-test between pairs of test and control data, where statistically significant difference is indicated by p <  <dig>  . rt-pcr experiments were each repeated independently at least  <dig> times and yielded similar data; representative experiments are shown. for human vein experiments, similar results were achieved for at least  <dig> independent patient samples. for ca2+-imaging, n is the number of independent experiments  and n is the number of cells analysed per coverslip.
