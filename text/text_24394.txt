BACKGROUND
early hybridization-based studies indicated that the soybean genome has undergone at least one round of large-scale duplication  <cit> . this finding was supported by analyses of expressed sequence tags   <cit> , which suggested an additional duplication event, with estimated times of approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mya. the generation of so many duplicated genes likely gave rise to a large number of new, novel and perhaps unique gene functions  <cit> . it is possible to gain insight into their gene function through the exploration of transcriptome data.

with the release of a high-quality draft of the g. max genomic sequence  <cit> , we are in a position to significantly improve our understanding of the soybean transcriptome. previous gene expression studies have been performed using est sequencing, spotted microarrays and affymetrix genechip technology. these include a study in soybean seed development using laser capture microdissection  <cit>  and studies of the iron stress response in soybean  <cit> . other expression atlases have been produced for arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, lotus japonicus and medicago truncatula  <cit> . however, array-based methodologies are constrained by prior knowledge of gene sequences. this limits the patterns of gene expression to a subset of the total transcriptional activity in an organism. for instance, the soybean affymetrix genechips used in the le et al.  study contained sequences that represent  <dig>  genes in the glyma <dig>  genome assembly  <cit> . this is less than half of the genes identified as "high confidence" gene models in g. max in the glyma <dig>  annotation release, and less than a third of all the predicted genes in g. max  <cit> . as a result, information collected using these genechips is incomplete, providing only a fragmented picture of transcript accumulation patterns.

the recent development of next-generation sequencing technology provides information on gene expression independent of genomic sequence knowledge. it also has the advantage of higher sensitivity and greater dynamic range of gene expression than array-based technologies  <cit> . the rna sequencing method  was originally developed to take advantage of the next-generation illumina sequencing technology to improve the annotation of the yeast genome and explore its transcriptional expression profile  <cit> . the rna-seq approach was shown to have relatively little variation between technical replicates  <cit>  for identifying differentially expressed genes. this technique has since been applied to several other organisms to answer questions regarding gene annotation and gene expression, but to our knowledge has not been applied to create an organism-wide gene expression atlas  <cit> .

in this report, we apply rna-seq to investigate seven tissues and seven stages in seed development in g. max, and compare transcript reads to the most recent release of the g. max genome sequence . we present an overview of the rna-seq data for soybean as a potential model for future rna-seq atlases, and address several challenges that arise due to the nature and quantity of next-generation transcriptomic sequence data.

RESULTS
mapping of short-read sequences
tissues from leaf, flower, pod, two stages of pod-shell, root, nodule and seven stages of seed development were collected from soybean plants  and raised in growth chambers designed to mimic illinois field growth conditions. throughout this manuscript, tissues from stages of development are labeled according to approximated days after flowering  where appropriate . total rna from each tissue and developmental stage was isolated and sent to the national center for genome resources  for sequencing. data from the illumina genome analyzer ii instruments produced  <dig>  to  <dig>  million 36-bp reads for each of seven non-seed tissues and  <dig>  to  <dig>  million 36-bp reads for each of seven stages of seed development . the alignment program gsnap  <cit>  was used to map the reads to two reference genomes: g. max and bradyrhizobium japonicum. a digital gene expression analysis was performed on the 'uniquely mappable' genome  <cit>  which includes reads that mapped to the reference genomes with at most two mismatches or one indel and no mismatches  <cit> . reads that failed these criteria or mapped to multiple locations were excluded.

the following groups of short-read sequences  were excluded:  <dig> % of the reads failed our criteria due to mismatches or indels,  <dig> % mapped to multiple locations and  <dig> % mapped to the b. japonicum genome. highly repetitive sequences, defined as reads that mapped to  <dig> or more locations, ranged from  <dig> % of the total reads in nodule to  <dig> % of the total reads in seed 28-daf suggesting that these highly repetitive reads may have important functional roles in specific tissues. further investigation of highly duplicated genes plus transposable elements  <cit>  may be warranted to determine what functional role highly repetitive sequences may have in these tissues.

there were  <dig> % of the reads that passed the filtering criteria and mapped uniquely to the g. max reference genome. these reads were used in the digital gene expression analysis of all  <dig> tissues. of the  <dig>  predicted gene models in g. max ,  <dig>   genes were transcriptionally active by the following definition: having a sum of at least two counts in one or more tissues in this study . in the glyma <dig>  annotation set  <cit> ,  <dig>  genes were identified as "high confidence" as determined by the following criteria: correlation to full-length cdnas, expressed sequence tags, homology, and ab initio methods . of those  <dig>  highly-confident genes  <cit> ,  <dig>   genes were transcriptionally active in this study  and  <dig>   highly-confident genes were not. conversely, there are an additional  <dig>   transcriptionally active gene models from the lower-confidence gene models . these gene models will be evaluated for possible inclusion to the list of highly-confident gene models.

expression and gene structure
since transcription of genes may be inversely correlated with gene size in plants  <cit> , the coding regions of the predicted genes were inspected to provide insight into the characteristics of an expressed gene in g. max. the average lengths of the first, internal and last exon for the predicted genes were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  base pairs respectively . this is similar to values reported for arabidopsis:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  base pairs, respectively  <cit> . the gc content of the exons in g. max and a. thaliana were also similar . the significance in the size differences were evaluated using the non-parametric mann-whitney u test with a p-value cutoff of 10e- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the coding regions of genes that were not found to be transcriptionally active in this study were smaller and had a lower gc content than coding regions in genes that were transcriptionally active . a similar trend was found for the genes identified as highly-confident and for genes that were not identified as highly-confident . the genes identified as neither highly-confident nor transcriptionally active  have the smallest exon length and lowest percentage gc content in g. max. this group, which has the smallest genes, may correspond to pseudogenes or may indicate that further improvement is needed in gene model prediction. however, a larger sampling of tissues over several developmental stages and environmental stresses is required before pseudogene determinations can be made.

tissue-specific analysis of the soybean transcriptome
for the tissue-specific analyses, raw digital gene expression counts were normalized using a variation of the reads/kb/million  method  <cit> . the rpkm method corrects for biases in total gene exon size and normalizes for the total short read sequences obtained in each tissue library. a hierarchical clustering analysis of the transcriptional profiles between tissues and developmental stages using a pearson correlation suggested three groupings of tissues: underground tissues , seed development  and aerial tissues    <cit> .

a z-score analysis was conducted to gain insight into the gene expression patterns of each tissue  <cit> . the z-score numerical value is calculated by taking for each gene and tissue the -normalized log2-transformed transcript count, subtracting the normalized mean transcript count of all tissues and dividing by the standard deviation of the normalized transcript count of all tissues. the z-score numerical value measures the number of standard deviations the expression level of a gene in a specific tissue is from the mean expression level in all tissues. the z-score analysis revealed that aerial and underground tissues are distinguished from seed tissue by a bimodal expression pattern with more genes from aerial and underground tissues shifted toward higher expression values . transcription values in non-seed tissues are less similar than transcription values in stages of seed development resulting in a greater distribution of z-score values and a noticeable portion of genes with z-score values near the positive extreme between  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating a high specificity for the tissue. we provide a supplementary list of genes with z-scores in the  <dig>  to  <dig>  value range for each tissue . to examine the validity of tissue specificity using z-score analysis, we inspected the gene annotations based on the dana farber tentative consensus sequences  <cit>  for all genes greater than  <dig>  normalized count in nodule tissues. of the ten genes with this level of expression found between a z-score value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in nodules, all genes had an annotation. we identified four genes: glyma10g <dig>  glyma10g <dig>  glyma20g <dig> and glyma10g <dig> as leghemoglobin a, leghemoglobin c <dig>  leghemoglobin c <dig> and leghemoglobin c <dig>  respectively. we identified another five genes: glyma13g <dig>  glyma14g <dig>  glyma15g <dig>  glyma19g <dig> and glyma13g <dig> as nodulin  <dig>  nodulin  <dig>  nodulin  <dig>  nodulin 26b and nodulin  <dig>  respectively. the last gene, glyma08g <dig>  was identified as a nodule specific extensin gene based on the panther classification system  <cit> . these gene annotations support the validity of using high z-score values for identifying tissue specific genes from rna-seq data.

a heatmap of the rpkm normalized log2-transformed transcription count was generated on the top  <dig> genes with the highest expression . two areas on the heatmap indicate high gene expression and specificity to seed and nodule, respectively . the genes that are specific to nodule are many of the same as those identified by the z-score analysis  whereas the genes specific to all of seed development were less apparent in the z-score analysis . these genes specific to seed development have gene annotations based on the dana farber tentative consensus sequence that include many well known seed specific molecular functions: beta-conglycinin, oleosin, lectin, lipoxygenase, sucrose-binding protein and seed coat burp domain protein. the high expression levels of these genes suggest an important role during seed development and warrant further investigation especially for those genes with no known annotation. the z-score analysis of all tissues and heatmap of genes with the highest expression values in this rna-seq atlas is provided for further investigation into tissue specific genes.

gene specific analysis of transcription in multiple tissues
on the other side of the gene expression spectrum are genes that have little variation across all tissues and developmental stages. these are thought to fulfill housekeeping functions. housekeeping genes  are commonly used as reference genes to normalize expression counts across tissues and developmental stages  <cit> . as a starting point for identifying hkgs in soybean, we provide a list of  <dig> genes generated from the lowest coefficient of variation  among the rpkm normalized expression counts of the predicted gene models in the  <dig> tissues .

a goslim analysis  <cit>  on the hkgs was performed to determine what functions are represented in this list. a fisher's exact test  <cit>  determined the goslim functions that were over-represented in the hkgs when compared with all expressed genes and indicated an over-representation of the following functions: 4-alpha-glucanotransferase activity , rna binding , mrna 3'-utr binding , structural constituent of ribosome  and translation initiation factor activity . several other organisms contain genes with similar functions have also been indicated as stably expressed adding support to the list of hkgs generated here  <cit> .

interestingly, when all the tissues are included in the hkg analysis only three genes had a correlation of variance below 20%. however, if only the subset of tissues that represent seed development are included in the analysis  <dig> genes, many of which have hkg related annotations, have a correlation of variance value below 20% . although it would be advantageous to identify genes to use as universal references for normalization, it may not be possible to identify genes that are constitutively expressed at high and stable levels in all tissues and developmental stages under all biotic and abiotic stresses. thus, these lists should be used as guides and the raw  and rpkm normalized data  is provided for reanalysis to identify the best constitutively expressed genes in the particular tissues of interest.

in the glyma <dig>  gene set  <cit> ,  <dig> soybean genes were identified as specific to legumes. in the context of the schmutz et al. paper, this means the gene was identified in m. truncatula and g. max and not in populus trichocarpa or more distantly-related species. in our study,  <dig> of these legume-specific genes  had a rpkm normalized log <dig> transformed transcription count greater than zero in at least one tissue. an analysis of the transcription patterns of these lsgs in the  <dig> tissues indicated a propensity for the lsgs to be transcribed in specific tissues as indicated by boxes in the heatmap . every major tissue group contained a cluster of genes with unique transcription of legume-specific genes. there were also constitutively expressed lsgs with transcription in all tissues. legume-specific expression in specific tissues is also supported by evidence of preferential gene expression in nodules of medicago  <cit> .

an inspection of the legume specific genes found only in seed development revealed three genes with similar expression profiles that vary between no expression in seed 10-daf and some of the highest expression seen in the heatmap in seed 42-daf. the first two genes, glyma06g <dig> and glyma04g <dig> are oleosins . the third gene, glyma02g <dig>  has an annotated of "lectin precursor 1"  <cit> . these three genes were also identified in the heatmap for the highest expressed genes. oleosins are membrane proteins found in seed oil bodies  <cit>  whereas lectin precursor  <dig> is localized to protein storage vacuoles  <cit> . a more in-depth analysis may be warranted for these genes to determine how their similar expression profiles in seed development is affected by the negative correlation between protein and oil seed content.

general trends in expression profiles for all genes were examined by a comparison of the transcription count for every tissue to every other tissue using a fisher's exact test with a fdr correction of  <dig>   <cit> . to visualize the number of genes that have significantly different expression between two tissues, we created a table in which each cell represents the number of genes that have a significant increase in gene expression between a tissue on the vertical axis and a tissue on the horizontal axis . under this scheme, all differentially expressed genes for two tissues, for example root and leaf, are given by the genes in the root  to leaf  cell plus the genes in the leaf  to root  cell. this table indicates that the two tissues with the greatest number of genes exhibiting a significant increase in gene expression occur between seed 28-daf and flower with  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. similarly, the tissues that have the least number of genes with a significant increase in gene expression occur between seed 25-daf and seed 28-daf with  <dig> genes.

one application of this table is to explore the differential gene expression between two developmental time points in a tissue of interest to gain insight into the gene functions and thereby the biological processes that occur during particular stages of development. for instance, the goslim molecular functions over-represented in the  <dig> genes that show a significant increase in gene expression between seed 25-daf and seed 28-daf are cellulose synthase activity, nutrient reservoir activity and urease activity. for the  <dig> genes with a significant increase in gene expression between seed 35-daf and seed 42-daf the over-represented goslim molecular functions are structural constituents of cell wall, nutrient reservoir activity and urease activity. we see that both nutrient reservoir activity and urease activity are important biological processes that occur during these stages of development. a web interface for this table is provided that links each table cell to a downloadable list of genes.

we also explored gene expression in the underground, seed and aerial tissue groups identified by the hierarchical clustering analysis. a gene is considered preferentially expressed in one of these groups if there is a significant increase in transcriptional activity based on a fisher's exact test  in at least one tissue of the group over all other tissues. the underground, seed and aerial gene lists contain  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes, respectively.

the characterization of the coding region of genes found in each tissue group may improve our understanding about how exon size and tissue-specificity may be related.

an analysis of exon length and gc content for each of these groups revealed that gene expression in each group of tissues has larger coding regions and a higher percentage of gc content than the average of all predicted genes . however, interpretation of these results needs to be made with caution since the larger exon size and higher gc content may be an artifact of identifying significantly expressed genes resulting in an increase in the average transcriptional activity within the group  <cit> . however, since the process of identifying genes with preferential expression is identical for each group, a comparison between groups is straightforward. using a mann-whitney test  <cit>  to verify our observations, we find that genes with preferential expression for underground tissues have a larger first exon than seed and aerial tissues. on the other hand, aerial tissues have a greater number of exons than seed and underground tissues. the mann-whitney test also suggests the differences between the lengths of the total transcribed regions for seed, underground and aerial tissues are significant. the total length of the transcribed regions for each of the tissue groups are  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> , respectively. since the total exon length for each group did not vary significantly, this suggests the average total intron length varies depending on tissues type. additionally, no significant relationship between gc content and tissue-specificity was found.

each list of preferentially expressed genes contains a wealth of information about gene coexpression. as an example, we explored a dendrogram  generated in the r programming language using the hclust command  <cit> . a dendrogram shows how genes are clustered based on gene expression but lacks a description of the log <dig> transformed expression data for the genes found in each subclade. dendrograms of this size were not explored in previous gene expression analyses  <cit>  likely due to the challenge of displaying the dendrogram in a meaningful way. the number of genes in the seed dendrogram resulted in a figure that was much wider than it was tall making visualization of the overall clade structure difficult.

to better summarize the hierarchical clustering analysis, we present a boxplot dendrogram. the seed dendrogram was simplified to provide the viewer with an overview of the clade structure . the genes below the overview dendrogram, representing a subclade, were grouped together and the log <dig> gene expression values for each tissue in the transcriptional profile were displayed as boxplots . the advantage to this type of display is apparent in the three figure inserts, which indicate that the clustering resulted in three clades. clade  <dig>  clade 2- <dig> and clade 2- <dig> correspond to genes with significant increase in transcription primarily in early seed development , genes with significant increase in transcription primarily in late seed development  and genes with a significant increase in transcription primarily at an intermediate stage in seed development , respectively. hierarchical clustering was also performed to generate dendrograms for the aerial and underground preferentially expressed genes lists and are provided as supplementary figures . all dendrograms and lists can also be access via the rna-seq website  <cit> .

discussion
in this report we present an rna-seq atlas  for glycine max using next generation illumina sequencing of the soybean transcriptome. one of the open questions concerning the rna-seq method is what to do with short read sequences that map to multiple locations in a genome. this question is particularly relevant in the paleopolyploid genome of g. max, which has undergone two rounds of large-scale duplication events in the last ~ <dig> my that resulted in as many as four regions of synteny within most of the genome  <cit> . previous studies have indicated the potential for under-representing the total number of counts for a gene especially in closely related gene families  <cit> . we found that as long as we were aware of the potential pitfalls of under-representing the gene counts, valuable insight into gene expression and the functional relatedness of genes could be obtained from the uniquely mappable reads alone.

given our limited understanding of the full complexity of the soybean genome, it is gratifying that only a small percentage  of the reads that mapped uniquely were located outside the predicted gene models. this suggests that the initial annotation of the soybean genome sequence has captured the majority of transcriptional activity. using the additional information on transcriptionally active regions, refinement of the existing gene models and the ability to identify new gene models will be improved.

in an analysis of gene-specific expression in multiple tissues, one of the challenges is overcoming the large dynamic range of expression counts generated by next generation sequencing technology to identify genes with similar overall expression profiles. the data presented here has a dynamic range for gene expression greater than six orders of magnitude. although a log2-transformation can significantly reduce the dynamic range, a hierarchical clustering on log2-transformed data  <cit>  has the potential to miss genes with highly similar gene expression profiles but with significantly lower or higher gene expression at each tissue. to identify all genes with similar gene expression profiles, a fisher's exact test with a fdr correction of  <dig>  for a given gene was performed on the raw expression counts between each tissue and every other tissue resulting in a complete description of change in gene expression. since the fisher's exact test normalizes for total counts in the calculation and the comparison was between counts of the same gene and therefore have the same gene length, the raw counts  were used. a hierarchical clustering of gene expression based on the direction of change in expression and whether or not it fails the null hypothesis that the expression levels are the same between two tissues identifies all genes with similar expression profiles regardless of the expression levels in each tissue.

in the analysis of tissue-specific gene expression , we determined that the general pattern of gene expression fell into three groups : underground, seed and aerial tissues. the similarity between this clustering using rna-seq and the clustering of transcriptionally similar tissues in medicago  <cit>  using affymetrix genechip technology further validates this result. the tissues in soybean are clustered by closely related plant structures: nodules are modified root cortical cells; each seed stage is part of seed development and pods, shells and flowers are modified leaves  <cit> . in addition, seed developmental stages are more similar to aerial tissues than to underground tissues, as seeds are more similar to pods than to roots.

although expression profile similarity does not necessarily imply similar function, it may provide insight into co-regulated networks of genes. clusters of genes that are similarly expressed in specific tissues or developmental stages may provide a hint as to the functional role of the genes with no known molecular function. in an effort to divide the data into manageable pieces, we first identified genes that were significantly expressed in seed over the other two tissue groups: underground and aerial. then, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to identify interesting sub-clades of genes with similar expression profiles in seed development. many of the challenges in displaying and interpreting a dendrogram  were overcome by combining the dendrogram with log2-based boxplots of each tissue  resulted in three clades. clade  <dig>  clade 2- <dig> and clade 2- <dig> contain genes with significant increase in transcription primarily in early, late and intermediate seed development stages. a fisher's exact test with a bonferroni correction was performed on the goslim categories for genes the three clades to determine which goslim categories were over-represented when compared to the goslim categories for all genes in the genome. the early seed development clade was over-represented in beta-glucuronidase activity, galactosyltransferase activity, structural constituents of ribosomes and glutamate dehydrogenase activity. the intermediate seed development clade  was over-represented in leucocyanidin oxygenase activity, whereas the late seed development clade was over-represented in nutrient reservoir activity.

since seed protein is negatively correlated with seed oil content and yield  <cit> , genes with a goslim function of nutrient reservoir activity may provide insight into the seed-filling process. to better understand the extent of clustering for genes with nutrient reservoir activity in the late seed development clade and to determine their relationship with seed filling, we identified all genes  in g. max with a goslim molecular function corresponding to nutrient reservoir activity . of these genes,  <dig> are transcriptionally active in our data set, with a total transcription count greater than two in all tissues. of these transcriptionally active genes,  <dig> are found in four subclades of the late seed development clade . twelve of the genes with nutrient reservoir activity are found in the subclade 2-1:g . these genes are highly expressed with an rpkm normalized total transcription count in all tissues ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  counts. additionally, the genes identified in clade 2- <dig> with a goslim molecular function of nutrient reservoir activity are part of the seed-filling process as most of these genes have functions based on the dana farber tentative consensus sequence  <cit>  that include glycinin, beta-conglycinin and sucrose-binding protein . since the other genes in the late seed development clade identified above have similar expression profiles to these  <dig> genes it is likely that there are other genes in the late seed development clade and in particular, genes in subclade 2-1:g that have similar or complementary roles in seed filling. further data analysis is required to elucidate how the other genes in the late seed development clade relate to the goslim-identified nutrient reservoir genes and how insight into the seed filling process will improve seed protein quality, content and yield. this rna-seq atlas provides a starting point for such an analysis.

as a final example to demonstrate the power of combining a rna-seq atlas with the genomic sequence, consider the soybean lipoxygenase genes   <cit> . lipoxygenase enzymes act on polyunsaturated fatty acids to form polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides that can be converted to aldehydes and alcohols, which result in a lower flavor quality in soybeans  <cit> . null genotypes were identified in gamma-irradiation experiments that knocked out the three lipoxygenase genes: lox <dig>  lox <dig> and lox <dig>  that expressed during seed development  <cit> . lox <dig> and lox <dig> are linked and found on chromosome  <dig>  while lox <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the g. max seq-atlas confirms that for the  <dig> lipoxygenase genes  identified in the soybean genome and designated with a goslim molecular function of lipoxygenase activity , only  <dig> genes are highly and significantly expressed during seed development based on a fisher's exact test with a fdr correction of  <dig>  during seed development. the genes are: glyma13g <dig>  glyma13g <dig> and glyma15g <dig> . the seq-atlas data and the latest genome release support the tight linkage between lox <dig> and lox <dig> on chromosome  <dig> - only approximately  <dig> base pairs separate the two genes. although the identities of these lipoxygenase genes were determined prior to knowledge of the genomic sequence and access to next generation sequencing  <cit> , it is not difficult to imagine how the rna-seq atlas could be used to increase the efficiency of scientific discovery.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the g. max seq-atlas brings together rna-seq data from a diverse collection of tissues and provides new tools for the analysis of large transcriptome data sets obtained from next generation sequencing. this was achieved using the uniquely-mappable short read sequences in an rna-seq digital gene expression analysis of the paleopolyploidy soybean genome. we demonstrate how insight can be gained from the global expression patterns of genes, present a method for visualizing a hierarchical clustering of genes based on gene expression and show examples of how this soyseq-atlas can be mined. genomic data from the emerging next generation sequencing technology  <cit>  is rapidly accumulating and new methods for analyzing this data is required to improve our understanding of the genetics and genomics of legumes. the soyseq-atlas presented here provides a valuable resource for understanding the subtle nuances of the soybean genome and will allow scientists to generate the technological advances in legume agriculture that are required to meet the increasing demand for soybean products.
