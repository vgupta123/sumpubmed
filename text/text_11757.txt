BACKGROUND
a major landmark in the modern era of medical genomics research is the sequence and assembly of the human genome. the current genome build, however, contains numerous gaps and areas of potential misassembly. completion of an accurate assembly is a continuing challenge given the presence of multiple highly duplicated and complex regions that remain largely intractable to analysis with commonly used assembly techniques  <cit> . nonetheless, finishing these regions has significant implications for identifying causative disease loci and in turn efficacious treatments for patients with genetic and genomic disorders  <cit> . the 1q <dig> region of chromosome  <dig> is a classic example, given its association with multiple clinical disorders and its complex architecture, with multiple regions of duplication that make complete assembly extremely difficult. the  <dig> human genome assembly reflects this challenge, containing  <dig> gaps in the  <dig>  mb 1q <dig> - <dig> region.

closing these gaps in the current 1q <dig> build is a particularly pressing problem given that recurrent genetic and genomic variations in this region have been implicated in a multitude of disease phenotypes: neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism  <cit>  and schizophrenia  <cit> , microcephaly and macrocephaly  <cit> , cardiac conduction and structural defects  <cit> , multiple congenital anomalies , and ocular deficits  <cit> . additionally, this region contains multiple neuroblastoma breakpoint family  genes encoding  <dig> of the known  <dig> copies of duf <dig>  a protein domain that has undergone a striking copy number increase specifically in the human lineage  <cit> . while this extreme duf <dig> copy number increase has been linked to the evolutionary expansion of the human brain  <cit> , the many interspersed and tandem duf <dig> paralogs in the 1q <dig> region are thought to be major contributors to 1q <dig> genomic instability leading to numerous disorders  <cit> . ascertaining the exact involvement of duf <dig> and other 1q <dig> sequences in these diseases has been hindered by the incomplete nature of the 1q <dig> assembly and of the duf1220-encoding gene family  in particular. without a complete, accurate assembly, genotype-phenotype associations are difficult to identify, and those that are found may not provide a complete picture of disease etiology and in some cases may even be incorrect and misleading.

to pursue the completion of the 1q <dig> genomic region, a haploid hydatidiform mole  genome was utilized which reduces the challenges introduced by using a diploid, polymorphic genome  <cit> . using bacterial artificial chromosomes  produced from the chm <dig> genome the  <dig> gaps that remained in this region were closed and a single haploid genomic path generated that spans the 1q <dig> - <dig> region. this new, completed assembly was used to more precisely analyze genomic structural variation in individuals with 1q <dig> cnvs and microcephaly or macrocephaly.

RESULTS
sequence finishing and assembly
a total of  <dig> bacs were sequenced generating a contig of  <dig> ,150 bp, covering the 1q <dig> -q <dig>  region of interest. this successfully closed all  <dig> gaps in the grch37/hg <dig> assembly, added  <dig>  bp of sequence, and resulted in the addition of  <dig> new genes. in addition to these sequence additions, numerous differences between the previous 1q <dig> assembly and the chm <dig> assembly were discovered, including changes in gene order,  <dig> inverted loci spanning multiple genes, and gene loss associated with multicopy genes . while confirmation testing conducted on the assembly  indicates that the chm <dig> library is representative of the general population, it cannot be ruled out that some of the changes may be true variants within the human population.figure  <dig>

table  <dig> describes changes in copy number between the grch <dig> and new chm <dig> assemblies. the majority of non-duf <dig> changes were gain in copy, with  <dig> genes previously under represented in grch <dig>  three nbpf genes are no longer present, although duf <dig> numbers remained close to the same with duf <dig> copies being mostly redistributed among the remaining nbpf genes. this may indicate that the gene loss is an artifact of misassembly rather than true gene copy number differences. numbers do not include the additional duf <dig> domains and nbpf genes added to the 1p <dig>  region as a result of the human-specific 1q <dig>  segmental duplication described in the text.

the duf1220-containing nbpf family of genes experienced by far the largest number of changes resulting from the chm <dig> assembly . while there was no significant change in duf <dig> number within the 1q <dig> region, the domains were redistributed among  <dig> predicted nbpf genes, rather than  <dig>  resulting in sequence changes to  <dig> nbpf genes and the redesignation of many duf <dig> domains to different domain subtypes . finally, two nbpf genes were assigned to 1p <dig> , resulting in the addition of  <dig> duf <dig> domains to the haploid genome. this gives a total haploid duf <dig> copy number of  <dig> domains in the grch <dig> genome build. it is important to note that this is likely the minimum number of copies in the human genome due to the tandemly duplicated nature of these domains and the resulting challenges to sequencing. current sequencing technology often collapses tandemly duplicated reads into single copies or, less frequently, overestimates the number of copies within these regions. therefore, the true number of copies in these duplications may be slightly different than that determined by sequencing.figure  <dig>

table  <dig> displays a summary of all annotated nbpf regions in the grch <dig> build. there are  <dig> nbpf-like regions, with  <dig> nbpf genes and  <dig> pseudogenes.

the two nbpf genes newly placed at 1p <dig>  are the result of a human lineage specific  segmental duplication  from the 1q <dig>  region to the 1p <dig>  region, discovered through sequencing efforts for the chm <dig> 1q <dig> region . this sd is not present in other primates and is particularly interesting as both it and its paralog in the 1q <dig>  region were identified in szamalek et al.  <cit>  as the breakpoint regions for a hls pericentric inversion event. this event is hypothesized to be the catalyst for the expansion of the 1q <dig> c-band and the hyper-amplification of the hls duf <dig> triplet in the 1q <dig> region  <cit> . the discovery of this sd is an important finding as it helps narrow the time frame in human evolution when the hls chromosome  <dig> pericentric inversion took place.figure  <dig>

confirmation of duf <dig> copy number estimates
digital droplet pcr
duf <dig> clade  copy number estimates were compared within each nbpf gene between the new and old assemblies . duf <dig> domains are subdivided into six clades based on sequence similarity, referred to as conserved  clades  <dig> through  <dig> and human lineage specific  clades  <dig> through  <dig>  con <dig> and hls <dig> were analyzed for duf <dig> copy number validation. the con <dig> copy number determined by ddpcr of chm <dig> dna was comparable to that seen across multiple control samples, suggesting that the assembly of this clade within nbpf genes accurately reflects the general population. the hls <dig> copy number, meanwhile, was slightly lower than that seen in the majority of control samples, suggesting that the chm <dig> genome may have fewer hls copies than would be found in healthy individuals. it should be noted that hls <dig> duf <dig> domains are highly polymorphic within the population and as such these results do not necessarily suggest that either version of the 1q <dig> assembly will be more useful for future analysis of copy number-phenotype correlations for this locus. copy number measurements of pde4dip as measured by ddpcr reflected those predicted by the molar assembly and mirrored those seen in healthy controls. in addition, a primer set mapping uniquely to nbpf <dig> and nbpf <dig>  from the grch <dig> assembly was used to determine if the loss of one of these regions was unique to the chm <dig> cell line or representative of healthy individuals as well. ddpcr results demonstrate a single copy, confirming loss of nbpf <dig> and retention of the one copy of nbpf <dig>  overall, results indicate that the chm <dig> assembly generally is representative of healthy individuals and can be used in place of the current human genome build.

single dna molecules  fluorescently labeled at bspqi sites were used to examine genome segment length within nbpf genes in bacs used to produce the new assembly. segment lengths between bspqi labels observed in consensus maps de novo assembled from bac molecules harboring nbpf <dig>  nbpf <dig> and nbpf <dig>  were consistent to those observed in in silico maps of the chm <dig> assembly.figure  <dig>

into consensus genome maps . one of the assembled consensus genome maps is shown here  and is aligned to an in silico map based on the 1q <dig> sequence assembly described in this paper . locations of the nbpf <dig> and nbpf <dig> genes on the 1q <dig> sequence assembly are marked in red. segment lengths between labels in the nbpf <dig> gene are consistent across in silico and de novo maps.



evolutionary analysis
all complete hls duf <dig> triplet sequences were used to create a phylogenetic tree . the phylogeny reveals first and foremost a confirmation that only nbpf genes within the 1q <dig> region have undergone triplet hyper-amplification. while two new nbpfs found to reside in 1p <dig>  each contain a hls duf <dig> triplet, they remain in the unexpanded form and cluster with the first triplets of other nbpf genes within the phylogeny. second, as the 1p <dig>  nbpf genes are unexpanded when compared to their 1q <dig>  counterparts, the most parsimonious conclusion is that the sd from 1q <dig>  to 1p <dig>  occurred prior to the genomic changes that led to the hls duf <dig> triplet hyper-amplification. this, combined with the previous discussion of the sd being found to be the breakpoints for the hls pericentric inversion event, lends more support for the hypothesis put forth recently  <cit>  that the 1q <dig> -q <dig>  region within the pericentric inversion is a unique genomic environment that allowed the hls duf <dig> triplet to hyper-amplify.figure  <dig>

mapping disease samples
arraycgh results of patient samples from the baylor college of medicine with known 1q <dig> cnvs  <cit>  were mapped to the  <dig> assembly and the new wustl chm <dig> assembly. figure  <dig> shows a comparison of these data plotted on the  <dig> assembly  and the chm <dig> assembly . regions affected by these copy changes overlapped, but were not identical, between assemblies. in addition, there are genes that do not appear to be affected by deletion/duplication in the  <dig> assembly  that fall in affected regions in the chm <dig> 1q <dig> assembly .of note, one segment of the  <dig> assembly that contains multiple genes is inverted in the new assembly . by mapping patient data to this new assembly, it was discovered that this inversion, while representative of the chm <dig> genome, may be polymorphic in the human population . this conclusion is based on the fact that in the new chm <dig> assembly, samples with type i deletions  have a contiguous gene deletion region, and an additional region deleted proximally that is not contiguous, suggesting two deletion events . in the  <dig> assembly, these two deleted regions are contiguous, suggesting one deletion event rather than two. as a single-deletion event is more likely than multiple deletions events, it is likely that this inversion occurred in the chm <dig> genome but may not be the more common allelic form in the human population.figure  <dig> 
comparison of arraycgh profiles of patients with 1q <dig> deletions and duplications between the grch37/hg <dig> assembly and the chm <dig> assembly. samples with known duplications are represented in pink, type i deletions in blue, and type ii deletions, which are larger than type i deletions and include the thrombocytopenia-absent radius  region, in black. gray vertical regions in the grch37/hg <dig> assembly represent gaps that were eliminated in the chm <dig> assembly. green bars above the grch37map and below the chm <dig> map indicate the approximate location of the type i deletion in each assembly. note that the inverted gene segment in the chm <dig> assembly requires a two-deletion event rather than single-deletion event to explain the type i deletion mapping pattern. tick marks at the bottom of the figure are separated by 2 mb; the grch <dig> assembly starts at  <dig> , <dig> and the chm <dig> assembly starts at  <dig> 



by remapping array results for  <dig> patients with 1q <dig> cnvs to the new assembly, regions affected by deletions and duplications were identified with better certainty and precision. in the future, the more accurate and complete 1q <dig> assembly will also allow for better mapping of breakpoints of these copy number changes, which will in turn aid in localizing disease-causing genes and regulatory loci, and in the development of a morbidity map of the region.

CONCLUSIONS
this investigation demonstrated that resources developed from a haploid hydatidiform mole genome could effectively be used to complete assembly of chromosome 1q <dig>  one of the most complex and evolutionarily dynamic regions of the human genome. completing this region also has significant implications for studying human disease given the numerous disorders associated with cnvs, mutations and chromosomal aberrations in the 1q <dig> region. additionally, the complete 1q <dig> assembly will play an integral role in studies of human evolution, as 1q <dig> contains the majority of the  <dig> duf <dig> protein domain copies,  <dig> of which were added specifically to the human genome since the homo/pan divergence  <cit>  <cit> . the new 1q <dig> assembly has already led to the discovery of a novel copy of srgap <dig>  a gene in the 1q <dig> region that may be important for the elaboration of neuronal processes in the human brain  <cit> . efforts to localize disease-causing genes and regulatory regions that have previously been hindered by the incomplete nature of the 1q <dig> assembly and inaccuracies in the region may now move forward with a complete and reliable map to identify causative sequence variations.
