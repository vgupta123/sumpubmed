BACKGROUND
plants have evolved effective mechanisms to perceive, transduce and respond to a wide variety of biotic and abiotic signals by modulating cytosolic ca2+ levels  . ca2+ is a tightly regulated ion within cellular compartments, and the spatial and temporal control of its concentration makes it a versatile signalling component in plants  <cit> . under resting conditions, the cyt is maintained below  <dig> nm,  <dig> times less than in the apoplastic fluid and  <dig> to  <dig> times less than in vacuoles, endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts  <cit> . the ca2+ signaling system is composed of a receptor, a system for generating the transient increase in cyt through ca2+-pumps and -channels in response to a stimulus, recognition of the specific ca2+-signature by sensor proteins and transduction of the information to targets, and cellular systems responsible for returning cyt to its pre-stimulus level  <cit> . in plants, increase in cyt arises from the influx of ca2+ from the apoplast and/or from internal stores through specific channels like cyclic nucleotide gated channels, glutamate receptor channels or two pore ca2+ channels  <cit> . h+/ca2+ antiporters and ca2+-atpases pump the ca2+ ions back into the apoplast and/or intracellular stores once the receptor is no longer activated by ligand binding  <cit> .

cyt elevation is one of the earliest physiological events in root and leaf cells in response to pathogenic stimuli. upon perception of signals from pathogenic fungi or/and their pathogen-associated molecular patterns , cyt levels transiently increase in the host cells within seconds  <cit> . plants discriminate both the nature and strength of these stimuli to mount an appropriate rapid adaptive response for their survival  <cit> . recognition and perception of fungal pathogens via their pamps or effectors induces cyt elevation which leads to the activation of defence-signalling cascades against the attempted pathogen invasion  <cit> .

here, we report on an arabidopsis mutant which was isolated due to its failure to induce cyt elevation in response to exudate components from alternaria brassicae  sacc. a. brassicae is a necrotrophic deuteromycete fungus which causes black spot disease in crucifers including a. thaliana. it is a seed-, air- and soil-borne fungus that penetrates through all plant parts and causes lesions on leaves, stems, siliques and roots  <cit> . the disease progression ultimately results in plant death, mostly caused by host-specific toxins   <cit> . these are low molecular weight secondary metabolites of different chemical classes which can be isolated from liquid cultures or germinating spores  <cit> . the two well known phytotoxins destruxin b and sirodesmin pl from a. brassicae induce phytoalexin and camalexin biosynthesis in crucifers  <cit> .

we demonstrate that besides these toxs, non-toxic low molecular weight exudates components from a. brassicae also induce cyt elevation in arabidopsis stably expressing the ca2+ reporter protein aequorin. we have isolated and characterized a 
cytosolic 
calcium elevation mutant <dig>  which does not induce cyt elevation in response to the non-toxic exudate components. further characterization of cycam <dig> demonstrated that it also fails to induce cyt elevation in response to exudate preparations from rhizoctonia solani, phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the mutant is susceptible to infection by a. brassicae and sensitive to abscisic acid , drought and salt stress. thus, the mutated gene couples cyt elevation to biotic and abiotic stress responses.

RESULTS
exudate components from a. brassicae induce cyt elevation in arabidopsis roots
under resting conditions,  <dig> d-old transgenic apoaequorin-carrying a. thaliana roots in the col- <dig> background   <cit>  gave cyt values of 70 ±  <dig>  nm . a rapid and transient increase in the cyt concentration is observed  <dig> sec after the application of a cell wall extract , a water-diffusible exudate preparation from mycelia , germinating spores  or a tox preparation from a. brassicae to the roots . discharge at the end of the experiment demonstrates that less than 5% of the reconstituted aequorin was consumed after the stimuli, which ensures that the amount of aequorin in the sample is not limiting for the ca2+ signal  <cit> . after a lag phase of  <dig> –  <dig> sec, the levels of cyt begin to rise and reach a peak of ~  <dig> –  <dig> nm after  <dig> to  <dig> sec . subsequently the ca2+ levels steadily decreased. no cyt elevation is observed with the water control treatment  and barely any cyt elevation is observed in response to the cwe, epm and eps in the cotyledons of  <dig> d-old seedlings, while the tox preparation induces cyt elevation in the cotyledons although at lower rates than in the roots . for all stimuli, the magnitudes of the cyt responses are dose-dependent .

the a. brassicae exudates and tox preparations showed very similar cyt elevation kinetics which did not change after heat treatment  indicating that the components are thermostable . after ethyl acetate extraction the ca2+ activity in the aequous phase was comparable to the activity in the starting fraction, while barely any activity was detectable after evaporating the ethyl acetate and resolving the residual material in an equal volume of distilled water. this indicates that most of the activity remained in the aqueous phase. similar results were obtained after extracting the cwe, epm and eps preparations with methanol, whereas extraction of the tox preparation with methanol resulted in a supernatant and precipitate fraction which showed cyt inducing activities . this suggests that the cyt activity induced by the tox preparation is different from those induced by the three other preparations. size separation of the fungal components demonstrates that all compounds are <  <dig> kda .

a ca2+-based screen to isolate mutants defective in cyt elevation to the cwe
96-well plates in combination with a plate-reader luminometer equipped with an automatic injection system were used to screen for arabidopsis mutants which do not show cyt elevation in response to the a. brassicae cwe. the screen was performed with roots from individual 18-day-old m <dig> seedlings, after ethyl methane sulfonate  mutagenesis of transgenic apoaequorin-carrying m <dig> seeds in the col- <dig> background  <cit> . after recording the background cyt level for  <dig> min, the response to the cwe was measured for  <dig> min. roots which did not respond to the stimulus were used for the total discharge reaction to ensure that the lack of cyt elevation is not caused by a mutation in the apoaequorin gene. screening of approximately  <dig>  individual m <dig> plants identified  <dig> mutants which completely failed to induce cyt elevation in response to the cwe; they were named 
cytoplasmic 
calcium elevation mutants  . they were transferred to soil to obtain m <dig> and m <dig> seeds. three putative mutants did not survive in soil. for the other lines, the phenotype was confirmed with the m <dig> and m <dig> lines. none of them showed a visible phenotype under our growth conditions when compared to wt. genetic analyses of crosses uncovered that four cycam mutants were allelic. two of them, cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig>  were randomly chosen and used for further analyses. when cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> were backcrossed to wt  or wt , cyt elevation to the cwe was restored in ~25% of f <dig> progenies, indicating that the mutations are recessive.

cycam <dig> does not respond to the epm and eps, but responded to the tox preparation.
the cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> roots did not respond to the ca2+-inducing epm and eps preparations from a. brassicae, but showed a wt response to the tox preparation . to test whether the cyt responses induced by the cwe, epm, eps or the tox preparations show a refractory behaviour, roots of wt and the two cycam <dig> alleles were challenged first with either the cwe, epm or eps and subsequently with either the same stimulus or one of the other two stimuli. ten min after the first stimulus, when the cyt level is on its descent, the second stimulus was applied. figure 3e demonstrates that a second stimulus with the cwe to wt plants showed a weaker response. the same was observed for epm or eps, and any combination of the three stimuli cwe, epm and eps . the comparable cyt responses with refractory features for the three stimuli indicate that cycam <dig> is involved in all responses. therefore, the three preparations contain either the same compound or all of them require cycam <dig> for cyt elevation in arabidopsis roots. when the tox preparation is applied as a second stimulus, a strong cyt elevation without refractory feature is observed in wt roots, irrespective of whether cwe, epm or eps were the first stimuli. the tox-induced response occurs also in the cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> seedlings . therefore, the tox preparation-induced cyt response is independent of cycam <dig>  finally, we used flg <dig> to stimulate cyt elevation in the cycam <dig> roots and leaves. no difference to the wt is observed .

we applied staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor  <cit> , to wt roots before the cyt response was induced by the four a. brassicae-derived preparations.  <dig> μm staurosporine was used, because the basal level of cyt and the total aequorin discharge was not changed at this concentration . application  <dig> h prior to the treatment with one of the four ca2+-inducing stimuli significantly reduced cyt elevation . this suggests that the cwe-, epm-, eps- and tox-induced cyt elevation requires kinase activity.

cycam <dig> is also impaired in the cyt response to exudate preparations from other microbes
since cycam <dig> was isolated by a screen in which cyt elevation was impaired in arabidopsis roots, we further tested cwe and epm preparations from other microbes with the potential to interact with roots, such as from rhizoctonia solani, a necrotrophic fungus, phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae, a hemibiotrophic oomycete, and agrobacterium tumefaciens, a tumor-inducing bacterium. interestingly, cycam <dig> did not respond to the cwe and epm preparations from these fungi as well, and less to a cwe from a. tumefaciens, even though these preparations induced cyt elevation in wt . a cwe preparation from the root-colonizing fungus mortierella hyalina <cit>  induced cyt elevation in the roots of the wt and cycam <dig> mutant . therefore, cycam <dig> is involved in cyt elevations in response to different, but not all microbes.

to test whether the cyt responses induced by the cwes and epms from these four microbes show a refractory behaviour, roots of wt and the two cycam <dig> alleles were challenged first with the cwe from a. brassicae and subsequently with either the cwe or epm from one of the other microbes. the second stimulus showed always a weaker response. any combination of the stimuli confirmed that cycam <dig> is involved in all responses.

cycam <dig> is highly susceptible to a. brassicae and its tox preparation
since the cycam <dig> mutants were obtained by screening the ems mutated pmaq <dig> line with the a. brassicae cwe, we tested whether they are more susceptible to a. brassicae infections than wt.  <dig> d-old seedlings or leaves from  <dig> week-old plants were infected with a. brassicae. roots were infected by exposing them to a  <dig> mm fungal plug . the leaves of the seedlings and adult plants were infected with  <dig> μl of a spore suspension . the disease progression in the leaves measured as percentage disease index was determined  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after infection . the experiments demonstrated that cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> were more sensitive to a. brassicae infection than wt . the higher transcript level of the a. brassicae atr <dig> marker gene in cycam <dig> indicates that the mutant cannot efficiently restrict fungal growth . comparable results were obtained when the leaves were infected with the tox preparation . this can also be demonstrated by growing wt and cycam <dig> seedlings on media containing low concentrations of the tox preparation . false colour images of the plates representing fs/fm values confirm that wt seedlings barely suffer under the applied tox concentration while cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> do . taken together, cycam <dig> is essential to establish resistance against a. brassicae infection and its tox preparation. since the cwe, epm and eps fractions, which induce cyt elevation, do not induce toxic effects on the plants or effect seedling’s growth, while the tox preparation induces cyt elevation and toxicity , their roles are different.

to test whether the lack of the ca2+ response to exudate preparations from the pathogens r. solani and p. parasitica var. nicotianae has an influence on the resistance of arabidopsis,  <dig> d-old cycam1- <dig>  cycam1- <dig> and wt seedlings were exposed to a fungal plug of these pathogens. the disease progression was significantly faster for the mutants compared to wt . these data support the idea that cycam <dig> is more susceptible to pathogens.

cycam <dig> is sensitive to aba, salt and drought stress
when wt, cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> plants were grown on ms medium with  <dig> nm aba,  <dig> mm nacl or  <dig> mm mannitol for  <dig> weeks, their fresh weights were reduced compared to plants which were not exposed to stress. however, the extent of the reduction was much stronger for the mutant than for wt . the impaired fitness of the mutants can be demonstrated by measuring chlorophyll  fluorescence parameters which show that the efficiency of the photosynthetic electron flow is more impaired in stress-exposed mutants than in wt plants . this indicates that cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> are more sensitive to aba, salt and mannitol stress than wt.

cycam <dig> accumulates reactive oxygen species 
the amount of ros in unchallenged cyam <dig> roots is comparable to the amount in wt roots. however, after exposure to a. brassicae spores  for  <dig> days or an a. brassicae tox treatment , the ros level increases to significantly higher levels in the cycam <dig> roots compared to the wt control. a stimulatory effect of the a. brassicae treatment was also observed for the expression of marker genes for different ros species, although the pattern does not always match the pattern observed for the accumulation of the ros species . a. brassicae significantly stimulated the expression of redox-regulated transcription factor <dig> , a marker gene for singlet oxygen accumulation, oxidative signal inducible <dig> , a root specific marker gene for h2o <dig> accumulation, jasmonate-regulated gene <dig> , disease-resistance responsive  and dark-inducible <dig> , which represent general ros marker genes   <cit> . a lower, but significant response was also observed for indole glucosinolate o-methyl transferae <dig> , a marker gene for o <dig> -. a comparative analysis of the mrna data shown in figure 6c demonstrates that some genes are already upregulated in unchallenged cycam <dig> seedlings relative to the wt control and this effect is further promoted by the pathogen , while in other cases it is primary the pathogen infection that stimulates the accumulation of the mrnas in the mutant seedlings . apparently, the ros-related genes respond differently to changes in the ros levels, which might be due to the different regulation in response to the different ros. furthermore, the higher ros levels after a. brassicae infection may be partially caused by less efficient ros scavenging, since the mrna levels for several ros scavenging enzymes which are upregulated in wt roots after a. brassicae infection, are not upregulated in the roots of the cycam <dig> mutant .

phytohormone levels are altered in cycam1
the phytohormones salicyclic acid , jasmonic acid  and aba play crucial roles in regulating growth and development and coordinate the plant’s responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . sa-, ja- and aba-dependent stress responses are regulated by cyt levels in plants  <cit> . to check whether the sa, ja and aba levels are altered in the mutant, their levels were first measured in  <dig> d-old cycam1- <dig>  cycam1- <dig> and wt seedlings grown on ms medium. the sa and aba levels were slightly, but significantly higher in cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> seedlings not exposed to stress compared to the wt control . the ja level and that of its precursor cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid  were not affected by the mutation . however, the inactive form jasmonoyl-isoleucine  conjugate, -ja-ile  <cit> , and the bioactive form -7-iso-ja-ile  <cit>  were higher in cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> compared to the wt . this suggests that ja-modifying enzymes, but not ja synthesis, are targets of the cycam <dig> mutation. in conclusion, the levels of sa, aba and the bioactive -7-iso-ja-ile are higher in the ca2+ mutants, even when they are not exposed to stress.

a. brassicae infection induced sa, aba and ja accumulation in wt and cycam <dig> seedlings . induction of the phytohormone levels is quite similar in wt and the cycam <dig> mutant, when the %-stimulation by the pathogen is considered, except that the biologically active form of ja, -7-iso-ja-ile, is induced more strongly in infected wt than cycam <dig> seedlings . the levels of sa, aba and ja are almost identical in wt and mutant seedlings, while those of -7-iso-ja-ile are twice as high in the mutant compared to the wt control . the sa-inducible npr <dig> and pr <dig> , the aba-inducible bg <dig>  nced <dig> and toc <dig>  and the ja-inducible jaz <dig> were not or not significantly higher expressed in the unchallenged allelic mutants compared to the unchallenged wt control, whereas a minor stimulation could be observed for the ja-inducible myc <dig>  vsp <dig>  thi <dig>  pdf <dig>  and jasmonate_regulated gene <dig> . furthermore, in almost all cases, the % induction of these mrna levels by a. brassicae, three days after infection of the leaves with the spores, is comparable for wt and mutant seedlings. therefore, it appears that the higher mrna levels are mainly caused by the pathogen and not by the mutation. no significant differences could be detected for the aba <dig> and aba <dig> mrna levels.

the elevated phytohormone levels in unstressed cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> prompted us to investigate the response of the ca2+ mutant to exogenous application of sa, methyl jasmonate  and aba. the phytohomones were added to the ms medium in optimized concentrations. application of sa or meja  did not cause any difference in the growth of wt and cycam <dig> seedlings. however, aba  inhibited germination and growth of cycam1- <dig> and cycam1- <dig> more than wt. at  <dig> nm aba, the expansion of cycam <dig>  but not wt cotyledons was strongly inhibited . three weeks after treatment with  <dig> nm aba, the biomass of cycam <dig> seedlings was less than half of the biomasses of wt seedlings . thus, the elevated aba level already present in the mutants in addition to the exogenous application of aba is deleterious for the mutants. it is interesting to note that also in the presence of aba, no ca2+ response was observed in the cycam <dig> mutant in response to the fungal stimuli.

a. brassicae affects camalexin and glucosinolate levels
camalexin and glucosinolates are major sulphur containing secondary metabolites involved in plant defense in arabidopsis  <cit> . a. brassicae infection induced both camalexin and indolic glucosinolates  and their biosynthesis genes in the wt and mutant . the induction of the aliphatic glucosinolates  3-methylthiobutyl-gls, 4-methyl sulfinylbutyl-gls, 4-methylthiobutyl-gls and 8-methylsulfinyl-octyl-gls  was not significantly different between wt and mutant seedlings, while the agls 5-methylsulfinylpentyl-gls  and 7-methylsulfinylheptyl-gls  levels were higher in the wt than the mutants . the expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig> and bcat <dig> which are involved in agls biosynthesis  <cit>  were also upregulated in the wt and not in the mutant after a. brassicae infection . this shows that agls biosynthesis is less efficiently induced in cycam <dig> 

discussion
exudate preparations from a. brassicae, r. solani, p. parasitica, and a. tumefaciens induce cyt elevation in arabidopsis roots as monitored with the bioluminescent ca2+ binding protein aequorin . characterization of the ca2+ signatures induced by these stimuli demonstrates that they resemble those described for many mamps from various plant species: β-glucan from p. sojae in soybean cell cultures  <cit> , pep- <dig> from phytophthora sojae in parsley cell cultures  <cit> , harpin from pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolina in tobacco  <cit> , a yeast elicitor and chitosan in arabidospsis  <cit> , cryptogein from p. cryptogea and oligosaccharides in tobacco cell cultures  <cit> , pep- <dig> from p. sojae in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> , inf <dig> from p. infestans and boehmerin from p. boehmeriae in tobacco  <cit> , flg <dig> from flagellated bacteria and elf <dig> from the elongation factor tu in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> .

here we describe an a. thaliana mutant which fails to induce cyt elevation in arabidopsis roots in response to the exudate preparations from pathogenic root-interacting microbes. the chemical components which induce cyt elevation are either present in cell wall preparations from these microbes or released into the medium from mycelia or germinating spores. although these chemical mediators have not yet been determined, the shape of their ca2+ signatures, their dose-dependency and refractory nature demonstrate that they require cycam <dig> for function . the cycam <dig> mutant is not impaired in the response to flg <dig> and to a cwe from the root-colonizing fungus m. hyalina, indicating some specificity of arabidopsis response to pathogen exudates. like flg <dig> and the myc factor  <cit> , the active components in the a. brassicae exudate preparations are thermostable, hydrophilic, polar and of low molecular weight .

interestingly, the cwes, epm and eps preparations from a. brassicae induce cyt elevation , but not the typical disease symptoms of the fungus in arabidopsis, while the tox preparation from a. brassicae induces cyt elevation  and is toxic . toxs from pathogenic fungi including a. brassicae are known to disrupt membranes  <cit>  which might also contribute to the ca2+ influx into the cytoplasm. this might also explain the slower recovery of the ca2+ signal after tox application than after application of cwe, epm and eps preparations. the ca2+ response induced by the non-toxic cwe, epm or eps might establish a first line of defense that is then followed by a second stronger response induced by the tox.

cycam <dig> also plays a role in abiotic stress as demonstrated by the increased sensitivity of cycam <dig> seedlings to aba, salt and mannitol applications . cyt elevation is well documented in response to drought stress  <cit> . both aba and h2o <dig> induce cyt elevations in guard cells to regulate stomata aperture  <cit> . sustained cyt elevations induced by mannitol are required for tolerance to drought and osmotic stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, cycam <dig> is involved in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. it appears that the higher stress sensitivity of cycam <dig> is associated with imbalances in redox and ros homeostasis since the mutant accumulates more ros after a. brassicae infection than the wt . since this response can also be induced by the tox , the pathogen is not required. several ros marker genes representative for different ros species are more strongly upregulated in the a. brassicae-exposed mutant than in the wt  which is consistent with the idea that a general stress response cannot be efficiently repressed in the mutant. a quite strong stimulatory effect by a. brassicae in the mutant is observed for rrtf <dig>  a marker gene for singlet oxygen accumulation, while oxi <dig>  which codes for a root-specific kinase induced in response to h2o <dig> treatment and h2o2-generating stimuli, jrg <dig>  a general ros marker, the bhlh transcription factor gene at1g <dig> and din <dig> are already higher in the unchallenged mutant compared to the wt control and further upregulated in a. brassicae-exposed wt and mutant seedlings   <cit> . since the % induction is comparable in wt and mutant seedlings, the expression is promoted by the mutation and this effect is further stimulated after pathogen infection. the higher ros accumulation is partially caused by the inability of the mutant to efficiently scavenge the accumulation of ros, several genes for ros scavenging enzymes which are upregulated in wt roots, are not upregulated in the mutant roots .

to initially characterize the role of cycam <dig>  we measured the aba, sa and ja levels in untreated mutant seedlings and those exposed to a. brassicae infections or to the tox preparations. these three hormones play key roles in mediating disease responses to necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens. cycam <dig> accumulates higher aba, sa and bioactive ja derivative levels compared to wt . interaction studies with biotrophic, hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens on aba-deficient mutants demonstrate that aba is a negative regulator of plant defense  <cit> . the hypersusceptibility of cycam <dig> to a. brassicae, its tox and the other microbes tested confirms a link between cycam1-mediated cyt elevation, aba and innate immunity. the aba level was higher in the two allelic cycam <dig> mutants when they were not exposed to stress , and these mutants become even more sensitive to exogenously applied aba compared to wt . the aba biosynthesis genes bg <dig>  nced <dig> and toc <dig> were higher in a. brassicae-exposed cycam <dig> mutants than in the wt, whereas the aba <dig> and aba <dig> mrna levels did not show a significant difference . bg <dig>  a β-glucosidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum, hydrolyzes glucose conjugated, biologically inactive aba to produce active aba  <cit> . nced <dig>  a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and timing of cab expression <dig>  are involved in de novo aba synthesis  <cit> . therefore, elevated aba levels in a. brassicae-exposed cycam <dig> mutants may be caused by a higher de novo synthesis and the conversion of inactive aba to its active form. exposure of cycam <dig> with elevated aba levels to even more exogenously applied aba leads to more severe lesions, as shown by the germination and growth assays on aba-containing media .

a. brassicae infection induced sa  and sa-responsive gene pri  in cycam <dig> and wt seedlings. sa has both negative and positive roles in plant defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens  <cit>  and references therein]. the phospholipase dβ <dig>  mutant and mutants impaired in phosphatidic acid  biosynthesis were more susceptible to b. cinerea infection compared to the wt and this was associated with a higher sa level in the infected mutant plants  <cit> , similar to our observations with cycam <dig>  pldβ <dig> binds ca2+, hydrolyzes phospholipids to generate pa and is involved in hormone signaling  <cit>  and the response to disease resistance  <cit> . therefore, the slightly elevated sa levels in unchallenged cycam <dig> suggest that cyt elevation restricts sa accumulation, which becomes harmful if the mutant is exposed to sa-stimulating biotic and abiotic stress.

ja, methyl-ja and other bioactive derivatives are important molecules in regulating induced defense responses against necrotrophic pathogen infection  <cit> . a. brassicae infection induced higher ja levels in cycam <dig> than in wt seedlings, while the levels in unchallenged wt and mutant seedlings is almost identical . therefore, ja may act as a positive regulator of enhanced susceptibility to a. brassicae in cycam <dig>  the role of ja in disease susceptibility to a. alternata f. sp. lycopersici  and its aal-tox is well established for tomato  <cit> . furthermore, ja promoted aal-tox-induced cell death through ja insensitive <dig>  receptor-dependent ja signalling  <cit> . the expression of the ja-responsive genes myc <dig>  vsp <dig>  jaz <dig>  thi <dig>  and pdf <dig>  was slightly higher in a. brassicae infected cycam than wt seedlings . the higher mrna levels for the marker genes of the myc  and erf  branch of the ja pathway in cycam <dig> suggests that both branches are regulated by cycam <dig>  in addition, the expression of the jrg <dig>  a common ros marker gene involved in biotic and abiotic stress and ja signaling  <cit> , was higher in unchallenged cycam <dig> and wt seedlings, and the presence of a. brassicae led to a similar %-age increase in the mrna levels for both wt and mutant seedlings . these findings suggest that cycam <dig> is involved in control of ja accumulation and signaling. furthermore, the agls biosynthetic genes bcat <dig> , myb <dig> and myb <dig> <cit>  were higher in a. brassicae-infected wt seedlings compared to a. brassicae-infected cycam <dig> seedlings . this suggests that the agls-synthesizing genes play an important role in defense against a. brassicae infection in arabidopsis mediated through cycam <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we isolated a mutant which does not induce cyt elevation in response to different pathogenic fungal exudates. cycam <dig> is involved in cyt-mediated abiotic and biotic stress responses . the cycam <dig> mutant accumulates higher levels of the biologically active phytohromones sa, aba and -7-iso-ja-ile, is sensitive to exogenous aba applications and accumulates more ros than wt after a. brassicae infection, although the ros levels in the unchallenged wt and mutant seedlings are comparable. the ca2+ response in the wt can be induced by the non-toxic cwe, epm or eps which might establish a first line of defense, followed by a stronger defense response induced by the tox.
