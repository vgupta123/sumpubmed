BACKGROUND
semi-dwarfism is a valuable and widely used trait in intensive agriculture. the high yield potential of semi-dwarf cultivars is attributed to their improved harvest index, lodging resistance, and more efficient utilization of the environment  <cit> . the green revolution, led by semi-dwarf varieties in wheat, was due to the introduction of the rht gene, which encodes a mutant form of a della protein, a gibberellin signaling repressor  <cit> . the green revolution in rice was due to semi-dwarf varieties carrying sd <dig>  a single locus encoding a defective gibberellin 20-oxidase- <dig>   <cit> .

semi-dwarf barley cultivars have been successfully used around the world. in china, more than  <dig> dwarf and semi-dwarf cultivars and entries have been developed since  <dig>  with an average  <dig> -fold yield increase over landraces and older cultivars  <cit> . there are more than  <dig> types of dwarfs or semi-dwarfs described in barley, among which semi-brachytic  <dig> , breviaristatum-e , and semi-dwarf  <dig>  are widely used in modern barley improvement  <cit> . the ari-e mutant from golden promise has been used in several european cultivars and is located on chromosome 5hl  <cit> . the uzu gene is located on chromosome 3hl, which has been the major dwarfing gene used in east asia barley breeding programs  <cit> . the dwarfism controlled by uzu is caused by a missense mutation of a single nucleotide substitution in the hvbri <dig> gene, which reduces the response to brassinolide  <cit> .

the sdw <dig> locus has been widely used to develop modern barley varieties in europe, north america, south america, and australia. there are at least four alleles at the sdw <dig> locus, which arose from separate mutation events: sdw <dig> a , sdw <dig> c , sdw <dig> d  and sdw <dig> e   <cit> . the sdw <dig> c allele was the first reported allele at the sdw <dig> locus, a spontaneous mutant selected from barley cultivar abed denso  <cit> . the sdw <dig> c allele was successfully transferred to cultivars deba abed and maris mink, and later introduced into numerous barley crosses in southern swedish and danish breeding programs  <cit> . the sdw <dig> a allele was induced by x-ray mutagenesis in a norwegian six-rowed barley jotun and has been used in western usa, canada, and australia to breed semi-dwarf feed barley cultivars like yerong and uc <dig> . the sdw <dig> d allele, probably the most important for breeding, originated from a mutant selected in the m <dig> generation of cv. valticky after x-ray treatment  <cit> . the mutant was officially released in czechoslovakia in  <dig> as cv. diamant, and this allele has been used for the successful release of more than  <dig> new malting barley cultivars in europe  <cit> . the sdw <dig> d allele has gained great acceptance in malting barley breeding programs in europe, canada, usa, and australia, while the sdw <dig> a allele has been limited to feed barley varieties  <cit> . the fourth allele, sdw <dig> e  was found in the m <dig> generation of cv. bomi after treatment with partially moderated fission neutrons in a reactor  <cit> . however, there are no reports of the use of this allele in variety development  <cit> .

the sdw <dig> locus is located on chromosome 3hl, but more distal from the centromere than uzu <dig>  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis revealed that the sdw <dig> gene in barley is located in the syntenic region of the rice green revolution semi-dwarf gene sd <dig>  encoding a gibberellin 20-oxidase enzyme  <cit> . however, it is not clear what the gene structure changes resulted in different functional alleles. the objectives of this study were to  confirm gibberellin 20-oxidase as the functional gene,  provide a detailed molecular characterization of different alleles at the sdw <dig> locus,  understand how gene expression at the locus is regulated, and  develop an allele-specific diagnostic marker for barley breeding programs.

RESULTS
cloning the hvga20ox <dig> gene from barley genomic dna
a fragment of 4831 bp was isolated from the tall barley varieties ac metcalfe, hamelin, and valticky following pcr amplification of genomic dna . based on fgenesh gene annotation, the barley hvga20ox <dig> gene  contains three exons and two introns, with 1030 bp for exon  <dig>  325 bp for exon  <dig>  490 bp for exon  <dig>  173 bp for intron  <dig>  and 1468 bp for intron  <dig>  the coding sequence is 1242 bp in length, with a 371 bp 5’ untranslated region in exon  <dig> and a 232 bp 3’ untranslated region in exon  <dig> . in addition, the isolated 4831 bp barley dna fragment contains a 974-bp 5' upstream sequence and a 371-bp 3' downstream sequence of the hvga20x <dig> gene.

the putative protein of the hvga20ox <dig> gene has  <dig> amino acids. the predicted protein contains a conserved domain of the 2og-fe oxygenase superfamily, non-haem dioxygenase in morphine synthesis, and gibberellin 20-oxidase .fig.  <dig> allelic variations of hvga20ox <dig> gene in barley. a: structure of hvga20ox <dig> gene; b: conserved domain of hvga20ox <dig> protein; c: sdw <dig> d allele; d: verification of deletion in sdw <dig> d allele in a dh pupation of baudin/ac metcalfe; e: sdw <dig> c allele mutation




the barley hvga20ox <dig> orthologous genes were identified by blastp in rice , wheat , aegilops , brachypodium , maize , sorghum , setaria italica  and arabidopsis . the amino acid sequence identity of the predicted hvga20ox <dig> proteins in other grass species and arabidopsis is listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the predicted protein of the barley hvga20ox <dig> gene was more similar to wheat and aegilops  than maize and brachypodium . as expected, the lowest level of identity was found for arabidopsis .

the barley hvga20ox <dig>  and hvga20ox <dig>  genes, previously isolated, are also involved in ga  biosynthesis  <cit> . the predicted protein of hvga20ox <dig> only shares  <dig>  and  <dig> % of sequence identity with hvga20ox <dig>  and hvga20ox <dig> , respectively. phylogenetic trees of the predicted proteins of barley hvga20ox <dig> and the orthologous proteins hvga20ox <dig> and hvga20ox <dig> were constructed .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees of the predicted proteins of hvga20ox <dig> gene including the ortholog proteins




allelic variation of hvga20ox <dig> in semi-dwarf barley
the nucleotide sequences of the hvga20ox <dig> gene from the three tall barley varieties  were identical. dna sequences of the hvga20ox <dig> gene were isolated from baudin and diamant, two semi-dwarf barley varieties known to have the sdw <dig> d allele. no nucleotide differences were detected between baudin and diamant. a comparison between the three tall barley varieties and sdw <dig> d allele semi-dwarf barley  identified a 7-bp  deletion in the coding region of exon  <dig>  from position  <dig> to  <dig>  in the sdw <dig> d allele . in addition, the previously detected a/g substitution was also confirmed in this study  <cit> . the deletion in the sdw <dig> d allele was predicted to cause coding frame shifts and premature translation termination. sequence analysis showed that there are ten internal ‘atg’ start sites in the sdw <dig> d coding sequence. among them, three ‘atg’ sites located in position 1026– <dig> ,1232– <dig>  and 1334– <dig>  could translate to a truncated protein with a conserved domain of the 2-oxoglutarate  and fe-dependent oxygenase superfamily .

another important semi-dwarf allele of the hvga20ox <dig> gene is sdw <dig> c . the dna sequence of hvga20ox <dig> was determined from a semi-dwarf barley deba abed. this allele did not have the sdw <dig> d  allele deletion. five different sequence variations were identified by comparing the hvga20ox <dig> gene sequence of deba abed with the tall barley cultivars . the deletion of a single “a” and a “gtta” insertion were located in the untranslated region of exon  <dig> in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the 4-bp insertion in the sdw <dig> c allele was further confirmed by using barley varieties with known genotype . in addition, two synonymous mutations were also detected at positions  <dig>  and  <dig> . an a/c transversion was also detected at position  <dig> in the 3’ utr region . however, none of the synonymous mutations in coding region and the transversion in 3’ utr is expected to explain the dwarf phenotype.fig.  <dig> the 4-bp insertion in the sdw <dig> c allele amplified by the marker mc40861p in hvga20ox <dig> gene. lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> represent the sdw <dig> a allele. dna templates :  <dig>  ac metcalfe,  <dig>  baudin,  <dig>  deba abed,  <dig>  jotun,  <dig>  hamelin,  <dig>  triumph,  <dig>  yerong,  <dig>  diamont,  <dig>  jotun,  <dig>  maris mink




in contrast to sdw <dig> c and sdw <dig> d alleles, all primer combinations of the whole gene in additional file 2: table s <dig> failed to amplify any fragment from the sdw <dig> a mutants. pcr amplification analyses spanning the hvga20ox <dig> gene locus and the neighboring genes identified a possible deletion of the whole hvga20ox <dig> gene in sdw <dig> a varieties .

mapping the hvga20ox <dig> gene in the baudin/ac metcalfe population
two molecular linkage maps have been constructed for the baudin/ac metcalfe dh  population. the first map was constructed with  <dig> dh lines and  <dig> ssr and aflp markers  <cit> . the second map has  <dig>  snp tags anchored to seven chromosomes, spanning a cumulative  <dig>  cm genetic distance  <cit> . in both maps the 7-bp indel polymorphism mapped to the expected location on chromosome 3h .

plant heights from three different field trials were used for qtl analysis. the average height of sdw <dig> d allelic plants was  <dig> to 19 cm shorter than the wild type plants in all trials . however, large variation in plant height was observed within an allelic class . a major qtl was identified for plant height and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the plant height variation . the qtl peak co-located with the hvga20ox <dig> gene-specific marker .

association analysis of the gene-specific marker in a natural population
one hundred and ninety-seven barley varieties, breeding lines and landraces were collected from australia, africa, china, european, north and south america and their plant heights varied from  <dig> to 105 cm. of those,  <dig> accessions had the 7-bp deletion, three accessions had the 4-bp insertion while two did not yield an amplification product . the 7-bp deletion points to the sdw <dig> d allele, the 4-bp insertion points to the sdw <dig> c allele and the lack of amplification points to the sdw <dig> a allele. twenty-one barley accessions with the sdw <dig> d allele belong to the obvious dwarf types, with heights varying from  <dig> to 70 cm. seven lines with the sdw <dig> d allele have a medium stature, from  <dig> to 80 cm. one sdw <dig> c allelic barley variety tx <dig> is the dwarf type. the two sdw <dig> a allelic barley varieties yerong and yan <dig> are of the dwarf type. the sdw <dig> a and sdw <dig> d alleles explained 29% of plant height variation in the  <dig> barley varieties . we only detected the sdw <dig> a and sdw <dig> d alleles in modern barley varieties. the results provide further support for ga <dig> oxidase  <dig>  as the functional gene for the sdw <dig> locus. we also observed that  <dig> barley varieties/lines displayed the short stature without the sdw <dig> a, sdw <dig> c and sdw <dig> d alleles in this population.table  <dig> barley varieties used in this study, their origins, plant height  and their genotype at the sdw <dig> gene locus

transcription levels of genes encoding the final steps of ga biosynthesis
our previous result demonstrated that the mutations in sdw <dig> d and sdw <dig> a reduced the gene expression of hvga20ox <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we also measured the expression of the other two homologous genes hvga20ox <dig> and hvga20ox <dig> . it is surprised that the expression level of hvga20ox <dig> was  <dig>  times higher in baudin  and  <dig>  times higher in jotun  while hvga20ox <dig> showed three times higher in baudin and  <dig>  times higher in jotun. the result suggests that partial or total loss of function of hvga20ox <dig> can be compensated by other ga <dig> oxidases, especially hvga20ox <dig> fig.  <dig> relative gene expression levels of hvga20ox1and hvga20ox <dig>  a: transcription level of hvga20ox <dig> at stem elongation stage in ac metcalfe , baudin  and joutn ; b: bulk-segregating analysis of hvga20ox <dig> gene expression at tillering stage in baudin/ac metcalfe dh population, each bulk contained  <dig> dh lines with different alleles of the hvga20ox <dig> gene; c: transcription level of hvga20ox <dig> at stem elongation stage in ac metcalfe , baudin  and joutn 




to further confirm if the increased expression of hvga20ox <dig> was due to partial loss of function of hvga20ox <dig>  we conducted a bulked segregant analysis of gene expression in the baudin /ac metcalfe  dh population. the expression level of the sdw <dig> d bulk matched with the sdw <dig> d parent baudin, with higher expression and reversed trend observed in the tall bulk and ac metcalfe  . from those results we conclude that partial loss  or total loss  of hvga20ox <dig> may be compensated by increased expression of hvga20ox <dig> 

discussion
modification of the gibberellin biosynthetic and signal transduction pathways was a crucial step in crop breeding, as it conferred the agronomically important semi-dwarf phenotype  <cit> . the rice green revolution gene sd <dig> was the result of reduced function of ga 20-oxidase- <dig>  <cit> . the ga 20-oxidases are involved in the later steps of ga biosynthesis, in which ga <dig> is converted into ga <dig>  <cit> . it is now clear that reduced function of the ga 20-oxidase gene leads to reduction in plant height in rice. a previous study has demonstrated that the sdw <dig> gene may be orthologous to the rice sd <dig> gene  <cit> . however, it is not clear how the gene structure changes resulted in dfiierent functional alleles. in this study, we characterized a full-length copy and alleles of the barley hvga20ox <dig> gene, which has a conserved gene structure when compared to the rice sd <dig> gene. sequence similarity analysis showed that the predicted protein of the barley hvga20ox <dig> gene shared  <dig> % of identity to its rice ortholog.

four alleles have been reported at the sdw <dig> locus. in this study, we characterized the hvga20ox <dig> gene from three independent mutants. the sdw <dig> a allele might be the result of a total deletion of the hvga20ox <dig> gene. nearly no expression of hvga20ox <dig> was detected for the sdw <dig> a mutant  previously  <cit> , which was consistent with a total deletion of the hvga20ox <dig> gene, as our study suggests. a recent study demonstrated that sdw <dig> e  also resulted from a total deletion of the hvga20ox <dig>  <cit> . the sdw <dig> c allele has a 1-bp deletion and a 4-bp “gtta” insertion in the untranslated region of exon <dig>  respectively. the sdw <dig> d  allele is caused by a 7-bp deletion in exon <dig>  which resulted in coding frame shifts and premature translation termination. as there is an internal atg, the sdw <dig> d  allele may lead to a truncated protein with a conserved domain of the 2-oxoglutarate  and fe-dependent oxygenase superfamily. thus, the sdw <dig> d  allele still maintains partial function of ga 20-oxidase. sequencing of different alleles at the sdw <dig> locus points to hvga20ox <dig> as the functional gene responsible for the phenotype.

based on our sequencing results, we designed an allele-specific marker. as expected, the allele-specific marker co-segregated with a major qtl controlling plant height in the dh population of baudin/ac metcalfe. the gene-specific marker was further tested in a natural population. we found the sdw <dig> a and sdw <dig> d alleles only in modern barley varieties and associated with plant height. these results provide further support for hvga20ox <dig> as the functional gene of the sdw <dig> locus. however, the molecular marker for the 4 bp insertion in the sdw <dig> c allele seems not associated with plant height in the natural population. we speculate that the 1 bp deletion may be more important for the gene function in the sdw <dig> c allele as the sdw <dig> d allele.

until now, no malting barley variety has been developed from the sdw <dig> a allele. bioactive gibberellins are not only essential regulators for barley growth and development, but are also essential for malting and brewing  <cit> . it is expected that the deletion of the hvga20ox <dig> gene in sdw <dig> a allele would result in reduced ga biosynthesis during the malting process. this would explain why the sdw <dig> a allele has been used exclusively in feed barley.

a recent study in arabidopsis thaliana reported  <dig> independent loss-of-function alleles at ga locus  <dig> , which encodes gibberellin 20-oxidase  <dig> , causing semi-dwarfness  <cit> . these results suggest that ga 20-oxidase might be a hot spot for phenotypic variation in crop and other plant species. further research is required to establish whether there is further allelic variation in hvga20ox <dig> in barley.

the predicted protein of the barley hvga20ox <dig> gene shared high identity with the aegilops and wheat orthologs , which raises the question why no such semi-dwarf mutants have been identified in these species thus far. such mutants have already demonstrated great potential to increase yield in rice and barley, and thus it seems worthwhile creating similar mutants in wheat as an alternative source of dwarfing genes. our results further demonstrate that ga <dig> oxidase homologs can functionally compensate for each other . this means that to achieve a similar feat in wheat, ga <dig> oxidase expression in all three genomes would have to be modified simultaneously. advances in sequencing and gene editing technologies may provide an efficient approach to identifying or producing such mutants in wheat.

previously, a snp in intron  <dig> was detected between semi-dwarf barley variety baudin and tall variety ac metcalfe  <cit> . the snp marker was mapped to chromosome 3h in the double haploid population of baudin/ac metcalfe, while co-segregating with plant height  <cit> . however, this snp is not unique for the sdw <dig> d allele. in contrast, the allele-specific marker in this study can be used as a diagnostic test for the sdw <dig> a, sdw <dig> d and wild-type alleles.

the sdw <dig> alleles explained part of the height variation in both the dh population and the test barley varieties. some barley varieties without the sdw <dig> a and sdw <dig> d alleles also displayed short stature. these results indicated that some novel dwarfing genes have already used to breed barley varieties . we also observed the plant height variation within allele classes was much greater than the variation between sdw <dig> d allele class and wild type class. this indicated that some novel dwarfing genes also responsible for the height variation between baudin and ac metcalfe .

methods
genetic materials and agronomic traits
the medium tall barley varieties used in this study included ac metcalfe, valticky , and hamelin. the semi-dwarf barley varieties diamant and baudin represent the sdw <dig> d allele. the sdw <dig> d allele in baudin was from triumph, which derived its sdw <dig> d gene from diamant. the barley variety deba abed represents the sdw <dig> c  allele. jotun is the sdw <dig> a mutant. yerong is a semi-dwarfing dual-purpose  barley variety carrying sdw <dig> a gene  <cit> .

a doubled haploid population comprising  <dig> lines was generated via anther culture from the f <dig> progeny of a baudin/ac metcalfe cross. the  <dig> barley varieties and lines used in this study were collected from australia, africa, europe, north and south america, and are listed in table  <dig> 

the mapping population  with its parents and the  <dig> barley accessions were planted at three sites in western australia. the field trial sites were located in the high rainfall agricultural zone, in order to achieve the maximum growing potential for the semi-dwarf genotypes. the dh lines and parents were planted in  <dig> × 5 m plots and the same randomized design was used at each site for convenience. parental and local barley varieties were used as grid controls for spatial analysis.

cloning of hvga20ox <dig> gene from barley varieties
polymerase chain reaction  primers were designed from the cloned fragments of the hvga20ox <dig> gene  <cit>  and barley genome sequencing information . the relative positions of each primer to the hvga20ox <dig> gene are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  all primers were synthesized by gene works pty. ltd. . the pcr reactions consisted of 50 ng genomic dna as template,  <dig>  μm of each primer, in a final volume of 10 μl containing 1 × pcr buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntp, and  <dig>  u taq polymerase . the pcr reactions were performed using the following program: denaturation at 94 °c for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, annealing for 45 s and extension at 72 °c for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °c for 5 min. the optimal annealing temperature of each pair of primer combination was determined by gradient pcr. the pcr products were cloned into pgem-t easy vector , and at least two independent clones from each pcr product were sequenced using an automated sequencing system .

sequence assembly and alignment
the target sequences of each variety were assembled by the seqman program . clustal x <dig> was used for multiple sequence alignment. the exon and intron, and protein sequences of the hvga20ox <dig> gene from each variety were identified by using blastn, tblastn, and online gene prediction software fgenesh . the orthologs of the barley hvga20x <dig> gene from other grass species and arabidopsis were confirmed by blastp. the identity of the deduced amino acid of the hvga20x <dig> gene among the orthologs was analyzed by dnastar. phylogenetic trees of the predicted proteins of the barley hvga20ox <dig> gene, including the orthologous proteins hvga20ox <dig> and hvga20ox <dig> was constructed using mega  <dig>  by maximum likelihood approach, and the confidence of the nodes was evaluated using  <dig> bootstrap replications.

real-time quantitative rt-pcr
rna was extracted from the stems at tillering or stem elongation stage using a spin column plant total rna purification kit co., ltd. cdna was prepared from 1 μg rna using amv first strand cdna synthesis kit co., ltd). qpcr reactions were performed using sybr green , bbi) and the applied biosystems stepone plus real-time pcr system. the real-time pcr assays were performed in triplicate for each cdna sample. to determine transcription levels of barley hvga20ox <dig> and genes encoding the final steps of ga biosynthesis, hvactin and hvgapdh were employed as reference genes for barley. the oligonuleotide sequences used for quantitative rt-pcr are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

to determine if other genes are regulated by hvga20ox <dig>   <dig> doubled haploid lines from the baudin/ac metcalfe population were selected based on the genotype of the hvga20ox <dig> gene to construct two pools  for measurement of the expression of other genes in the ga biosynthesis pathway. three biological repeats were used for rna extraction.

verification of the denso allele in a dh population
presence of the sdw <dig> d allele was verified in the dh population of baudin/ac metcalfe and barley cultivars. genomic dna was extracted from young leaves using the standard ctab protocol. dna samples were quantified using the nanodrop equipment and adjusted to a final concentration of 50 ng/μl for pcr. primers used are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  pcr amplification conditions were as described above. the pcr products were separated in 6% page gels.

qtl analysis for plant height
the software package mapqtl  <dig>  was used to conduct qtl analysis for plant height after import of the files for genotypes, phenotypes and genetic maps. interval analysis was first performed to estimate the closest markers associated with plant height, followed by multiple qtl model  analysis. lod threshold values applied to declare the presence of a qtl were estimated by performing whole-genome wide permutation tests using  <dig>  permutations. the qtl map was then generated using mapchart  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
our research provided further evidence that the gibberellin 20-oxidase gene  is the functional gene for the barley sdw <dig> mutants. the sdw <dig> d allele from diamant is due to a 7-bp deletion in exon  <dig>  while the sdw <dig> c allele from abed denso has 1-bp deletion and a 4-bp insertion in the 5’ untranslated region. the sdw <dig> a allele from jotun resulted from a total deletion of the hvga20ox <dig> gene. partial or total loss of function of the hvga20ox <dig> gene could be compensated by enhanced expression of its homolog hvga20ox <dig> and hvga20ox <dig>  a diagnostic molecular marker was developed to differentiate between the wild-type, sdw <dig> d and sdw <dig> a alleles and another molecular marker for differentiation of sdw <dig> c and sdw <dig> a. further research is required to establish whether the truncated protein could maintain partial function and whether there is further allelic variation in hvga20ox <dig> in barley.
