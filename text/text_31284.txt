BACKGROUND
restriction endonucleases  are indispensable as molecular scissors in the analysis, rearrangement, cloning and sequencing of dna  <cit> . restriction-modification  systems have been classified into four major types on the basis of their genetic and polypeptide organization, cofactor requirements, and their modes of recognition and cleavage: i, ii, iii, and iv  <cit> . of the  <dig> biochemically or genetically characterized restriction enzymes  <cit>  currently known,  <dig> type ii rm systems make up the largest biochemically characterized fraction  <cit> . only  <dig> of this vast number, however, are enzymes with different and unique specificities; the remainder are isoschizomers, that is, enzymes with the same substrate specificity as the prototype but originating from different bacterial genera, species or strains  <cit> .

worth mentioning among these enzymes are the subtype iis reases, which, in contrast to orthodox type ii reases, interact with the asymmetric sequence and typically cut dna in a strictly fixed location beyond its recognition site to produce blunt or sticky ends with 3'- or 5'-overhangs  <cit> . the known prototype subtype iis specificities discovered to date comprise only a small fraction of the possible asymmetric recognition sequences with no associated specific rease. for this reason, it is highly likely that new prototypical reases will be discovered within this very subtype. statistically, there are many potential symmetric and asymmetric recognition sites:  <dig> possible combinations of 4-bp sites,  <dig> of 5-bp sites,  <dig> of 6-bp sites,  <dig>  <dig> of 7-bp sites and  <dig>  <dig> of 8-bp sites. even with the current advent of whole genome sequencing aided by sophisticated software analysis of the potential restriction endonuclease genes present, accumulation of novel prototype specificities is slow. as reases still form the core of recombinant technologies, new findings of these enzymes in nature or the creation of artificial specificities in vitro  <cit>  or the improvement of existing ones  is of scientific and practical significance. the palette of everyday cloning tools is enlarged with every new prototype that becomes available. particularly refined improvements and applications of sub-type iis enzymes have been pioneered by wacław szybalski since the 1980s: these include universal restriction endonucleases, dna cleavage at a pre-programmed site, gene amplification, gene fusion, unidirectional dna trimming, methylated base location in dna and gene mutagenesis using excision linkers  <cit> . the majority of known type ii reases have been isolated from mesophilic bacteria. such enzymes are stable at temperatures below 45°c and are usually rapidly denatured at higher temperatures. the relatively few restriction endonucleases capable of withstanding higher temperatures therefore represent an extremely useful additional molecular tool  <cit> . for this reason the investigation of existing restriction endonucleases and the search for novel, thermally stable ones is entirely justified.

 <dig> thermostable type ii reases with different specificities have been discovered in species of the genus thermus  <cit> , including  <dig> prototypes: tati  <cit> , taui  <cit> , taqi  <cit> , taqii  <cit> , tfii  <cit> , tsei  <cit> , tspdti  <cit> , tspgwi  <cit> , tsp4ci  <cit> , tspei  <cit> , tsp45i  <cit> , tspri  <cit> , tsti  <cit> , tsui, tssi, tth111i  <cit>  and tth111ii  <cit> . obviously, then, thermus bacteria are a rich source of unique reases. a subset of these enzymes, the unique thermostable type iis reases from the thermus sp. family, is worth mentioning. we have already published the criteria for defining the thermus sp. family of reases  <cit> . examples of the family include tspgwi  <cit> , tspdti  <cit> , tth111ii  <cit> , tthhb27i  <cit> , taqii  <cit>  and tsoi  <cit> , arvydas lubys, personal communication). the members of this group are bifunctional enzymes with rease and methyltransferase  activities within a single polypeptide . all are stimulated by s-adenosyl methionine  or its structural analogues sinefungin  and s-adenosyl homocysteine , but otherwise they behave like type ii enzymes  <cit> . these enzymes also exhibit some features of types i and iii, however.

the bifunctional taqii enzyme is closely related to tspgwi, a prototype of the thermus sp. enzyme family  <cit> . according to barker et al. taqii rease recognizes the 5'-gaccga-3' and 5'-caccca-3' sites and cleaves 11/ <dig> nucleotides downstream  <cit> . the enzyme generates a certain partial fragmentation pattern corresponding to cleavage at the target site  <cit> . under the conditions tested previously, no complete taqii digestion was obtained, either by native  or by recombinant enzyme  <cit> . this was probably due to preferential site cleavage in various dna substrates. the restriction activity of taqii is neither inhibited nor stimulated by atp. interestingly, in contrast to the tspgwi enzyme, taqii rease displays marked differences in its response to adomet, which effectively stimulates its restriction endonuclease activity  <cit> . adomet is required for effective dna methylation. barker et al. noted minor endonuclease activity in taqii preparation. however, the separation of this putative activity from taqii in the course of purification was impossible, as native taqii is present in thermus aquaticus yt in minute amounts  <cit> . purification is therefore complicated and results in low final preparation yields. in addition, non-specific nucleases, co-purifying with native taqii, make precise digestions difficult. further complications in the enzyme analysis stem from the fact that, like other enzymes from the thermus sp. family, taqii does not cleave dna to completion to give a stable partial digestion pattern. after having noticed serious discrepancies between the experimentally obtained taqii dna digestion pattern  and that of the recognition sequence published by barker et al.  <cit> , we decided to explore taqii reaction features in greater detail. this paper has three aims:  to re-evaluate taqii recognition and cleavage sites;  to optimize both star-minimum and star-maximum reaction conditions for converting this prototype endonuclease, so far unused in recombinant dna technology, into a useful molecular tool;  to introduce the fidelity index for partially cleaving reases  - a useful variant of the fidelity index  <cit> .

in this paper, we show that recombinant taqii rease is unable to cleave after 5'-caccca-3' sites. thus, the prototype recognition sequence should be redefined as cleaving after 5'-gaccga-3' sites only. we determined the conditions both for minimizing and for stimulating star activity; we also introduced the fidelity index for partial cleavage .

RESULTS
devising artificial substrates differentiating taqii recognition site variants
as both the native taqii enzyme and that cloned into escherichia coli   exhibited the same cleavage pattern, the recombinant enzyme was selected for further work. set up to explain the observed discrepancy between published  <cit>  and observed taqii specificity  using plasmid dna substrates, the initial experiments were inconclusive, even though the cleavage patterns strongly suggested that the recognition sequence of this prototype differed from the sequence originally reported in  <dig>  <cit> . thus a set of five artificial dna substrates from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length was devised and obtained by pcr using a combination of mutagenic primers. the substrates contained selected canonical sites - variant 5'-caccca-3', variant 5'-gaccga-3' or both - to eliminate/explore the potential stimulatory effect of two recognition sequences, present in the cis configuration, on the activity of taqii rease . as shown in figure 2a, the expected  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp restriction fragments from the digestion of two alternative dna substrates, pcr  and pcr , containing a single  canonical site , taqii digestion of pcr was not complete. these results show clearly that 5'-gaccga-3' site is efficiently cleaved, whereas the second 5'-caccca-3' canonical site, reported by barker et al.  <cit> , was not cleaved at all, as detected in a very sensitive assay using the sybr green staining procedure. it is interesting to note that in contrast to the homologous tspgwi enzyme, which recognizes a related recognition site and also cleaves at 11/ <dig> nt away, taqii rease is capable of single, isolated cognate site cleavage. the results were further confirmed by the incubation of pcr  <dig> bp dna substrate, containing two convergent 5'-caccca-3' sequences . as expected, no digestion of the substrate was detected using sybr green staining . the same results were invariably obtained under a variety of buffer conditions . the experiments with bacteriophage lambda dna also addressed this issue, as multiple 5'-caccca-3' sequences are present there in all possible arrangements. even so, no clone was found to have resulted from 5'-caccca-3' cleavage .

determination of the taqii recognition sequence and cleavage positions by shotgun cloning and sequencing of the resulting clones.

relaxed recognition sites were determined by shotgun cloning and sequencing of the taqii restriction fragments obtained. after digestion, dna was blunted with t <dig> dna polymerase and cloned into the smai site of the puc <dig> vector. taqii 5'-gaccga-3' and taqii 5'-caccca-3', canonical recognition sequences of the enzyme as described by barker et al.  <cit> ; taqii*, variants of relaxed recognition sequences.

optimization of reaction conditions for taqii rease activity
the pcr substrates made for the precise quantitative determination of the optimal reaction conditions . since taqii exhibits pronounced star activity, two variants of the reaction conditions were determined, resulting in  minimum star activity, while maintaining reasonable cleavage activity, and  maximum stimulation of star activity. the fidelity index could be calculated from a comparison of the taqii digestion patterns obtained in the established reaction buffers  and , enabling the rational use of taqii in recombinant dna technology.

as a starting point, we used a previously published buffer composition  <cit> . three buffering systems exhibiting the highest buffering capacity in the ph range tested were used for optimal ph determination: sodium acetate-acetic acid for ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> , hepes-koh for ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and tris-hcl buffer for ph from  <dig> - <dig> . the ph of the reaction buffers was adjusted at 65°c after all the buffer components had been added. the cleavage reactions were performed under unsaturating conditions, where the enzyme was a limiting factor . no restriction activity was detected in the  <dig> - <dig>  range; activity increased to values close to optimal  in the  <dig> - <dig>  range, and reached a maximum in the  <dig> - <dig>  range at ph  <dig> - <dig> , while decreasing to 70% at ph  <dig> , to 34% at ph  <dig>  and to 33% at ph  <dig>  . at optimized ph , a buffer with variable concentrations of ammonium sulphate was used to determine optimal ionic strength. ammonium sulphate was chosen, as we noticed the stabilizing effect of either nh4+ or 2- or both on taqii enzyme, which translated into a longer lifetime of the enzyme in the reaction mixture and stronger suppression of star activity, as compared to nacl or kcl . the maximum activity in the 0- <dig> mm concentration range tested was obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> mm . as we did not observe any enzyme stabilization or activity increase with glycerol or non-ionic detergents, we did not evaluate these parameters further.

determination of the taqii star inhibitory/stimulatory condition and the fidelity indices
since taqii exhibits substantial star activity, it is crucial for potential applications of the enzyme in recombinant dna technology to find the conditions minimizing this phenomenon. we had expected that the buffer conditions minimizing star activity might not necessarily match those of maximum activity, so we explored taqii behaviour under enzyme oversaturating conditions to pinpoint subtle changes in star activity appearance; we also used a series of gel photographs, ranging from normal exposure to several stops of overexposure. the amount of enzyme activity used was effectively ca  <dig> times higher  than that used for ph and ionic strength optima. in the ph range tested  star activity reached a maximum at ph =  <dig>  and decreased sharply at ph =  <dig> , which is also the value of general peak activity . the results of the ionic strength effect are striking: there is nearly complete inhibition of star activity in 40- <dig> mm ammonium sulphate, which is far from the optimal activity value of 0- <dig> mm . thus we determined the minimum star activity conditions  at ph  <dig>  in  <dig> mm ammonium sulphate, while maximum star activity was obtained at ph  <dig>  in  <dig> mm ammonium sulphate .

these conditions were then used to carry out titration in order to determine and compare fidelity indices at both extremes. in order to apply the fidelity index  <cit>  to taqii, which gave a stable partial digestion pattern as the final reaction result, we needed to define a variant of the fidelity index for such reases. we established the fidelity index for partial cleavage  as the ratio of the maximum amount of enzyme showing no star activity to the minimum amount needed to obtain a stable partial digestion pattern. figure 5a shows the titration under close to the originally reported conditions  <cit>  of taqii activity and under optimal  buffer conditions: ph  <dig>  and  <dig> mm ammonium sulphate. there were no digestions with a  <dig> :  <dig> molar ratio of the enzyme to cognate site 5'-gaccga-3', but a stable partial digestion pattern was obtained at  <dig> :  <dig>  taqii is a bifunctional endonuclease-methyltransferase and it was observed to be a "slow" enzyme, just like other thermus sp. family enzymes  <cit> . nevertheless, when we extended the digestion time beyond the standard titration conditions presented in figure 5a, substantial digestion was obtained at the molar ratio of  <dig> :  <dig>  indicating that taqii is a multi-turnover enzyme . no star bands were detected until the ratio of 50:  <dig> was reached. the highest ratio tested  evidently became inhibitory, though still leading to digestion and no star bands, possibly due to the formation of dominant non-specific rease-dna complexes. thus, fi-pc takes values of > 16- <dig> for the optimized conditions, which is close to or exceeds the fi value originally established as the enzyme class "good"  <cit> . this finding is important for practical applications of taqii in recombinant dna methodology, with minimal star activity interfering with the desired cleavage pattern. on the other hand, as can be seen in figure 5b, very strong star activity was detected, dominating the expected non-star bands, under maximally relaxing conditions . under these conditions, fi-pc fell to  <dig> only. these conditions are actually also useful in dna manipulation methods when applied to frequent cutter techniques, such as representative library preparations, rflp, precise mapping, anonymous primer generation  <cit>  or thermal cycle labelling  <cit> . we are developing the "taqii star" technology further .

determination of taqii recognition sequence and cleavage site
the most significant proof of the redefinition of the prototype taqii specificity came from the digestion of custom devised substrates , containing both variants of the originally reported recognition sequence  <cit> . those results have been confirmed with three additional independent methods: shotgun cloning of bacteriophage lambda dna cut with taqii and end-repaired, direct dna sequencing of taqii digestion products, and genescan analysis of the gel isolated taqii restriction fragment. since a large number of 5'-gaccga-3' sequences  and 5'-caccca-3' sequences  are present in the bacteriophage lambda genome, this approach eliminates any bias towards potentially unfavourable nearest neighbourhood locations of the recognition sites and also the rather remote possibility of double divergent or convergent 5'-caccca-3' sequence arrangements being needed for cleavage, since all possible combinations of both sequence arrangements are present in lambda dna. even so, no cleavage is observed after 5'-caccca-3' sites.

for the shotgun cloning approach, the original barker et al.  <cit>  reaction buffer was used for a direct comparison of the results. even though there is an excess of 5'-caccca-3' sequences over 5'-gaccga-3' sequences in bacteriophage lambda dna,  <dig> of the  <dig> insert ends in the clones analysed were dna fragments resulting from 5'-gaccga-3' site cleavage and none from 5'-caccca-3' sequence cleavage. interestingly, in addition to the expected insert ends obtained,  <dig> ends are apparently due to star activity at 5'-gaccga-3' sequences , where no simple relaxation pattern is observed, as in the case of our previous report concerning related tspgwi  <cit> . this indicates that star activity, traditionally treated as an unwanted artifact, is in fact, for certain enzymes, a naturally inherent enzymatic activity . even though the star minimizing buffer composition is much closer to physiological conditions in vivo than the star promoting condition, a strikingly high content of star cleaved insert ends is observed in the clones.

direct confirmation of the previous findings came from the run-off sequencing approach. the pcr  <dig> bp dna substrate , containing convergent 5'-caccca-3' and 5'-gaccga-3' sequences located on the same dna fragment, was cleaved with taqii rease and subjected to dna sequencing with the dideoxy chain termination method utilizing fluorescent labelling in the α position. the pcr substrate generated was devised to serve as an internal control for taqii cleavage and dna sequencing - both cognate site variants were present in the same dna molecule. the investigated sequences are clearly seen because of the distance of 11/ <dig> nt between the cleavage site and the dna recognition sequence . unfortunately, owing to the known features of thermostable dna polymerase already included in the pre-mixed sequencing kit routinely used by the commercial service that we employed, resulting in polymerization difficulties at the very end of a linear dna template that are additionally complicated by the addition of adenines at the 3' end of the synthesized dna, the precise cleavage point could not be reliably confirmed by the direct sequencing approach. nevertheless, sequencing enabled the "clean" sequence to be read through the recognition sequence variant 5'-gaccga-3', followed by dna cleavage in the region of 11/ <dig> nt downstream. on the other hand, the sequencing reaction goes through the putative cleavage region located 11/ <dig> downstream from the recognition sequence variant 5'-caccca-3' without any decrease in signal strength . these results clearly confirmed that taqii neither recognizes nor cleaves the 5'-caccca-3' dna sequence variant.

in order to establish the recognition site with an independent technique and to obtain final confirmation of the recognition of the variant 5'-gaccga-3' as well as cleavage at  <dig> nt downstream in the top strand we used commercial genescan technology. based on the capillary electrophoresis of a set of labelled standards of fixed length with 1-bp resolution, this method provides a simple and precise means of comparing the length of the taqii cleavage products when electrophoresed together. this approach eliminates the above difficulties associated with the sequencing approach, where dna polymerase does not yield a clean end sequence. for this purpose a taqii substrate was prepared: this is a pcr fragment of  <dig> bp, containing both 5'-gaccga-3' and 5'-caccca-3' sites, located at opposite ends of the dna molecule . the cleavage of the dna substrate should result in the  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp restriction fragments  if completely digested at both sequences. however, no complete taqii digestion of the  <dig> bp pcr was obtained under the variety of conditions tested. a larger gel-isolated partial digestion fragment, the length of which is in the optimal range for genescan reading, was analysed. the value of  <dig> nt  thus obtained is in perfect agreement with 11/ <dig> cleavage after the 5'-gaccga-3' site variant.

the four approaches presented in this paper clearly show that taqii cleaves only after 5'-gaccga-3' sequences. this fundamental difference, as compared to the originally published prototype  <cit> , may be due to a number of factors:  in  <dig> dna analysis technology was much less refined than nowadays, so the 5'-caccca-3' variant would have been an artifact of the technique;  since taqii's star activity is strong, some of the star sites could have been mistakenly assigned as 5'-caccca-3';  native taqii is present in minute amounts in the thermus aquaticus yt strain, along with substantial non-specific nuclease activity;  co-purifying the third rease activity , in spite of the application of several chromatographic steps. thus, taken together, crude and low concentration preparation could have led to false cognate site determination. redefining the prototype specificity along with the quantitative fidelity index data and establishing compromise digestion conditions, where some of the enzyme's activity is sacrificed in exchange for "clean" cleavage with minimum star activity, provides a new, useful molecular cloning tool - a robust thermostable rease with unique specificity.
