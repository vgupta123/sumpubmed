BACKGROUND
small non-coding rnas are increasingly providing insights into important aspects of the biology of many organisms  <cit> . they include small interfering rnas  and micrornas , which are hallmarks of two important processes involved in rna silencing  <cit> . rna silencing is a general process in which small rna molecules derived from precursor dsrna molecules trigger sequence-specific repression of gene expression  <cit> .

mirnas comprise a family of non-coding rnas with approximately 21- <dig> nucleotides that down-regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. mirnas are generated from endogenous hairpin structures in the nucleus and play an important role in controlling diverse cellular functions in eukaryotes, including cell differentiation, development, apoptosis, and genome integrity  <cit> . in vivo experiments indicate a crucial role in cell proliferation and cell death processes for some mirnas, including lin- <dig> and let- <dig> in c. elegans; bantam and mir- <dig> in drosophila; and mir- <dig> in humans  <cit> .

the current understanding of mirna biogenesis involves a series of coordinated processes. briefly, primary transcripts of mirnas are processed in the nucleus by drosha, an rnase iii-like enzyme into pre-mirna, which are first exported into the cytoplasm by exportin- <dig> and then processed into mirnas by dicer, another type iii rnase  <cit> .

the primary method of identifying mirna genes has been to isolate, reverse transcribe, clone, and sequence small rna molecules  <cit> . in animals, discovery of mirna genes, by using molecular cloning based methods has been supplemented by systematic computational approaches that identify evolutionarily conserved mirna genes. bioinformatics tools search for patterns of sequence and secondary structure conservation that are characteristic of metazoan mirna hairpin precursors  <cit> . however, considerable filtering must be performed to elucidate likely mirna candidates. the 5' end of mirnas is reported to have a perfect base alignment of at least  <dig> consecutive nucleotides, which enables their identification  <cit> . the most sensitive of these methods indicate that mirnas constitute nearly 1% of all predicted genes in nematodes, flies, and mammals  <cit> . however, computationally predicted mirnas must be experimentally confirmed.

although the first mirna was identified in  <dig>  it was not until  <dig> that the breadth of the mirna gene class was recognized with cloning and sequencing of more than one hundred mirnas from worms, humans, mice, and other species  <cit> . however, no large-scale identification of mirnas has been carried out in schistosoma mansoni.

schistosoma mansoni is a human parasite that is responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. the parasite infects approximately  <dig> million people worldwide, causing morbidity and eventually death in central and south america and africa  <cit> . although schistosomicidal drugs and other control measures exist, the development of new control strategies is necessary. in recent years, increasing attention has emerged over sirnas as therapeutical agents  <cit> . the emergence of gene ablation technologies based on the rnai phenomenon has opened up new experimental opportunities. recently, several reports on the use of rnai for the studies of schistosomes were published  <cit> . in this context, we attempted to identify potential mirnas in s. mansoni. we use complementary experimental and computational approaches. we developed a homology-filtering approach used in a high-throughput pipeline in which all known mirna genes were used as reference mirnas. fifteen potential mirna candidates were discovered in s. mansoni using this analysis. the pipeline automated some of the manual steps, in particular a rule-based filtering approach for extracting the candidate pre-mirna sequence, and it can also be applied to other genomes. by sequencing small-rna cdna libraries, we provide experimental evidence for  <dig> potential mirnas candidates. the identification of new mirna in the s. mansoni genome presents relevant information that is likely to be important for parasite development and sexual maturation.

RESULTS
experimental identification of mirnas
cloning of short rnas from s. mansoni adult worm pairs
an adult worm cdna library of small rnas was constructed using an established method based on a sequential ligation of oligonucleotide adapters to a size-fractionated sample of small rnas  <cit> . concatenated dna fragments  were cloned into a plasmid vector to generate a library. a total of  <dig> recombinant clones randomly selected from the library were sequenced. twelve hundred sequences were analyzed and show to contain ~2- <dig> small rna sequence in the same vector. size distribution of the non-redundant mirna set ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, although the majority contained 20- <dig> nt,  <dig> nt being the most abundant. to identify the putative origin of the cloned sequences, a fasta search was performed against genbank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and the s. mansoni genome   <cit> . sequences that had significant homology to breakdown products of abundant non-coding  rnas such as rrna and trna were eliminated. a total of  <dig> ncrnas were grouped into  <dig> clusters and were identified as possible mirna candidates . one hundred and sixty-one mirnas were represented in the library by only one read and  <dig> were represented by clusters with up to  <dig> sequences. since mirnas are believed to occur at a frequency of approximately  <dig> - <dig> % of the total genes in the genome, the  <dig>  genes predicted for s. mansoni should have generated between  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas  <cit> . thus, the number of mirnas experimentally observed is in the expected range.

we further screened the candidate sequences against a database of known mirnas, mirbase  to compare our candidate s. mansoni mirnas to mirnas from different species. some mirnas showed a high degree of conservation. forty-two sequences had at least one match with mature mirnas from different metazoan mirna families, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and let- <dig> . for example, sma-mir- <dig> perfectly matched mirna family mir- <dig> from different species demonstrating mirna conservation among more than  <dig> species. previous studies in c. elegans showed that this mirna family is expressed throughout development  <cit> . the yield of probable mirna candidates was much lower for this analysis with s. mansoni than analyses of species that contain closer relatives in mirbase. the closest relative to s. mansoni in mirbase is schmidtea mediterranea. these two organisms belong to the same phylum, a relatively broad classification. the sequences that did not match any of the known mirnas  were considered to be putative members of novel families of schistosome mirnas.

expression analysis of mirnas in s. mansoni
the expression of mirnas is tightly regulated in both time and space. stage-specific or regulated mirna expression suggests a role in development  <cit> . while high throughput techniques, such as microarray and next generation sequencing are being used, northern blot still remains the consensus method for validating mirnas  <cit> . the frequency of reads of a specific mirna in a non-normalized library can also be correlated with the expression level of that mirna  <cit> . based on that, the most abundant candidate mirnas were further examined by northern blot to test for expression. northern blots of total rna from a mixture of male and female s. mansoni adult worms and the intramammalian larval stage, schistosomula, were hybridized with biotin-labeled probes. previous studies analyzed the expression pattern of the dicer gene during different life stages of s. mansoni. a threefold higher expression level was detected in seven day old schistosomula in comparison to the adult worm pairs  <cit> . it is possible that higher dicer gene expression at this time was selected for the control of retrotransposon activation that may be more prone to occur during this period of active larval cell division and growth  <cit> . we detected the expression for  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas in at least one of the  <dig> analyzed stages . we also analyzed in s. mansoni the expression of the five novel mirnas recently identified in s. japonicum   <cit> . three  of the five probes had a hybridization signal that was characteristic of mirnas, demonstrating evolutionary conservation. although the expression of sja-mir- <dig> and sja-bantam dropped quickly in s. japonicum lung-stage schistosomulum, we observed a strong hybridization signal for both mirnas in s. mansoni   <cit> . the other  <dig> candidates detected in s. japonicum  may be expressed in other life cycle stages or in undetectable amounts in s. mansoni in the life cycle stages tested. we observed  <dig> mirnas  expressed in both life cycle stages tested,  <dig> in adult worms only  and  <dig> in schistosomula only . these results suggest a role for these mirnas over the life cycle stages of s. mansoni possibly mediating important processes in the parasite growth and development.

sequence analysis indicated mir- <dig> as the most abundant mirna . although sequencing-based mirnas expression profiling is a tool for measuring the relative abundance of mirnas, the expression of the mir- <dig> was not detected by northern blot. in contrast, mir- <dig> is represented only by  <dig> clones in our sequences, which indicates a 12-fold lower expression level compared to that of mir- <dig> . however, our small rna blot analysis indicated that mir- <dig> was more abundantly expressed than mir- <dig> in the adult worm stage . the discrepancies between the cloning frequency and small rna blot results could not be attributed to variations in rna content because the same rna samples were used for both experiments. one possible explanation could be bias in cloning efficiencies, or differential turnover rates of these mirnas  <cit> .

the best method to differentiate mirna from other endogenous small rna is the ability of flanking sequences to adopt a pre-mirna fold-back structure with the mature mirna properly positioned within one of its strands enabling dicer processing  <cit> . eleven  of the  <dig> potential mirna detected by northern blot were mapped to ~ <dig> different locations on the genome. to assess which of the regions corresponded to the real location of the possible mirna gene, their secondary structures were studied using the vienna rnafold package http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/rnafold.cgi. each image generated was visually inspected. a non-redundant set of  <dig> potential mirna sequences were predicted to be capable of forming stem-loop structures characteristic of mirna precursors,  <dig> of them were also confirmed by northern blot . our results also show that multiple hairpin precursors for the same mirna were observed in more than one location in the parasite genome , pointing to the possibility that the same mature mirna may be transcribed from more than one mirna gene. next, the mirna genomic location was analyzed by blast against the s. mansoni genome. the selected mirnas genes were observed to be located on intergenic regions, in agreement with published results  <cit> .

computational identification of mirnas
homology search
the high-throughput homology search pipeline was performed with all known mirnas in mirbase . in total,  <dig>  mature mirnas were used as reference sequences. the e-value cutoff for this analysis was set at  <dig> . a total of  <dig> hits were registered. we observed  <dig> unique s. mansoni sequences, and  <dig> sequences were represented multiple times. for the blastn results see additional file  <dig>  table s2: high-throughput pipeline homology search results. the existing mature mirnas that produced these hits are reported, as well as the locations of the homologous sequences in the s. mansoni genome. all hits aligned with at least 95% of the mirna sequence, resulting in alignment lengths of 19- <dig> nt. all of the  <dig> unique mature mirna candidates returned by the blastn search were assigned an analysis identifier with prefix 'sman'.

rna folding
the extended sequences  were folded with rnashapes  <cit> . for the complete results for the extended sequence folding see additional file  <dig>  table s3: high-throughput pipeline extended sequence folding results.

mean free energy  is a widely used criterion for filtering rna folding results, and was observed to be an important filtering step in this analysis as well. the rationale for how mfe thresholds are derived, however, is not obvious when examining the literature. in fact, the guidelines proposed for uniform determination and annotation of mirnas given by ambros et al. do not mention mfe thresholds. instead, the guidelines merely suggest that to be considered a mirna, a candidate's lowest mfe fold should be a hairpin  <cit> .

determination of mfe threshold is dependent on tolerance to false positives, i.e. higher mfe thresholds result in inclusion of more candidates. a threshold of - <dig> kcal/mol has been generally used, but levels as high as - <dig> kcal/mol have also been explored  <cit> . we used a middle value of - <dig> kcal/mol as this genome has not been previously explored.

from the  <dig> unique s. mansoni sequences returned from the blastn search,  <dig> displayed mfe values of - <dig> kcal/mol or less when folded with rnashapes. forty three hairpins had mfe values greater than - <dig> kcal/mol.

all  <dig> of the extended sequences with mfe ≤ - <dig> kcal/mol displayed hairpins in at least one portion of the sequence when folded by rnashapes. at ~122nt in length, the sequence is considerably longer than a typical mirna hairpin, and as a result, only the ~70nt surrounding the mature sequence are of interest. this region was considered the candidate pre-mirna sequence. in each of the  <dig> hairpins detected, the region surrounding the mature sequence was within a hairpin.

of the  <dig> hairpins with mfe ≤ - <dig> kcal/mol,  <dig> structures contained the mature sequence entirely within the stem. the other  <dig> sequences contained the mature sequence partially or completely in a loop.

candidate pre-mirna sequences were extracted from the  <dig> remaining hairpins and were refolded with rnashapes. after refolding,  <dig> candidate pre-mirnas had mfe ≤ - <dig> kcal/mol. these  <dig> sequences were considered to be likely pre-mirna sequences. a summary of the results and the structures for the pre-mirnas candidates are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the yield of probable mirna candidates was much lower for this analysis with s. mansoni than analyses of species that contain closer relatives in mirbase. the findings suggest that it may have been difficult to find a large number of mirnas in this analysis, due to the possibility of a large amount of sequence divergence between s. mansoni and its closest relative in mirbase is s. mediterranea. on the contrary, if one was interested in studying mirnas in a mammal not found in mirbase, one would find  <dig> members from the same class and over  <dig>  mirna sequences in mirbase. however, for now, organisms such as s. mansoni must continue to have a mix of computational and experimental approaches, with an emphasis on experimental discovery.

comparison of results to existing work
the high-throughput pipeline yielded fifteen probable pre-mirna candidates. this number is comparable to the number of mirnas found by palokodeti et al., who identified ten mirna candidates in s. mediterranea by using all known human, drosophila and c. elegans mirnas as reference sequences  <cit> . however, the yields for the s. mediterranea analysis and for this analysis with s. mansoni are considerably smaller than other studies that have used homology methods with multiple genomes. luo et al. identified  <dig> mirnas in tribolium castaneum  using all available metazoan mirnas as reference sequences  <cit> . zhou et al. using a homology-based computational approach, found  <dig> human mirna homologs in the domestic dog using only human mirnas as the reference mirnas  <cit> . furthermore, baev et al. identified  <dig> chimpanzee mirnas with a homology-based approach, also using only human pre-mirna sequences as a reference set  <cit> . recently, novel mirnas were identified in schistosoma japonicum, a close relative of s. mansoni  <cit> . chatterjee and chaudhuri detected  <dig> homologous mirna sequences in the anopheles gambiae genome, using only drosophila mirna as the query sequence  <cit> . drosophila is a well represented group of organisms in mirbase, but it is also in the same order as a. gambiae. as a result, this close relationship produced a large number of hits. vertebrates, especially mammals, are currently the most represented organisms in mirbase, with respect to number of species and number of mirna sequences.

it is worthwhile to note the extent to which the yield decreases as the distance between species grows. as a result, these findings suggest that the yield of a homology-based analysis is very dependent on the available content of mirbase. artzi et al. used their recently released homology search web-server, mirnaminer, to increase the number of mirbase mirnas for seven mammals by 50%, identifying  <dig> new mirnas  <cit> . the strategy and filtering steps used by mirnaminer are very similar to those used in this paper, but moderately more comprehensive.

analysis of homology search hits by species
as shown in figure  <dig>  when the homology search for the high-throughput pipeline was performed against all known mirnas in mirbase, seventeen species had at least three or more hits with e-values <  <dig> . an additional eleven species had two hits, and another seven species had one hit. mus musculus displayed the highest number of hits with  <dig>  over four times the number of hits for the next most represented species, triticum aestivum. although m. musculus has a high number  of mirna sequences in mirbase, it does not appear that the sheer number of sequences is solely responsible for the higher frequency of hits. other organisms are also well represented in mirbase, but displayed relatively few hits. for example,  <dig> human mirnas are recorded in mirbase, but only five hits were observed in this study. including the eight hits from rattus norvegicus, over one-third of all hits observed were from the order, rodentia. the cause of this observation is unclear. these findings may be merely the result of incomplete coverage of the database, which is only capturing a small number of the actual mirnas present in mammals, or it may be possible that the mirnas that have been identified in these rodentia species are particularly well conserved across species.

both metazoan and non-metazoan mirnas were used as reference mirnas in this analysis. it was assumed that metazoan mirnas would be more likely to yield hits in s. mansoni, and that the non-metazoan sequences would provide somewhat of a negative control for the method, i.e. few hits should be observed with non-metazoan sequences. interestingly, four of the top eight represented species are plants: t. aestivum , physcomitrella patens , arabidopsis thaliana  and oryza sativa . the number of hits with e-values <  <dig>  for each major taxon listed in mirbase  is shown in figure  <dig>  with  <dig> hits, plants  represent 20% of the total number of hits with e-values <  <dig> . the most represented taxon is the subphylum, vertebrata, with  <dig> hits or 68% of the total hits. this finding is not surprising as vertebrata is also the taxon with the most number of mirnas in mirbase , more than three times the number of mirnas in the next largest taxa, viridiplantae  and arthropoda .

the percentages of mirnas from each major taxon in mirbase that returned a hit with e-value <  <dig>  are shown in figure  <dig>  the kingdom protistae  and phylum platyhelminthes  display the highest percentages of hits. however, both of these taxa contain only one organism in mirbase, with each organism containing less than  <dig> mirnas. of the three taxa that have the most representatives in mirbase, vertebrata and viridiplantae display similar percentages , and are both higher than arthropoda . it is interesting that a higher frequency of hits is observed for viridiplantae than for arthropoda, considering s. mansoni and arthropoda would be more closely related as both are metazoans. this is a further indication that the number of mirnas is likely to be much higher than that currently represented within the database.

observed mirna families
as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> different mirna families were observed in the homology search. of these,  <dig> families were observed multiple times, either from different species or within the same species. the mirna family observed most frequently was mir- <dig>  with  <dig> hits. also shown in figure  <dig> is the number of probable mirna candidates that were observed in each family. five of the six families with the most hits displayed at least one probable mirna candidate. ten of the thirteen families that displayed probable mirna candidates rank in the top sixteen families with respect to number of hits. these results suggest that mirna families that are highly conserved, appearing in the most number of species, may be most likely to yield probable mirna candidates.

CONCLUSIONS
the discovery of small regulatory rna molecules, mirnas, is undoubtedly one of the most important recent findings in biological research. this study demonstrates for the first time the presence of mirnas in s. mansoni identified by complementary experimental and computational approaches. by cloning and sequencing of  <dig> sequences from a small rna library,  <dig> potential mirna candidates were identified, of which  <dig> were predicted to form stem-loop structures characteristic of mirna precursors. the expression of  <dig> of them was confirmed by northern blot analysis. the homology search by the high-throughput pipeline was performed with all known mirnas in mirbase and fifteen novel likely mirnas were detected in the parasitic organism s. mansoni. the identification of mirna in the s. mansoni genome presents relevant information that is likely to be important to study various aspects as parasite development, gene regulation, evolutionary processes and sexual maturation.
