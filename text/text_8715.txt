BACKGROUND
protein ubiquitination plays a crucial role in numerous cellular processes such as cell growth, regulation of diverse signal transduction and disease  <cit> . the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to protein substrates requires a step-wise cascade of enzymatic reactions. first, ubiquitin is activated by e <dig>  in an atp-dependent manner by forming a high-energy thioester-bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue of e <dig>  the activated ubiquitin is then transferred to the core-cysteine residue of e <dig> . together with an e <dig> ligase enzyme, ubiquitin is attached via its carboxyl-terminus to an e-amino group of a lysine residue in the target protein. since e <dig> binds to both e <dig> and the target protein, and acts as scaffold between e <dig> and the substrate protein, the e <dig> ligase is the major determinant for selecting target proteins for ubiquitination. there is large number of genes encoding e <dig> ligases in all eukaryotes, and the diversity of e3s is thought to contribute to the substrate specificity of numerous target proteins. e <dig> ligases are structurally divided into three groups: hect, ring and u-box  <cit> . the hect-type e <dig> ligase is distinct from the other two ligases in that it forms a thioester-bond with ubiquitin prior to the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins. the ring-type e <dig> ligase contains a unique domain similar to the zinc finger motif that mediates protein-protein interactions  <cit>  and is further divided into two classes: one that can function alone and another that forms a complex with other e <dig> components  <cit> .

recent studies have shown that attachment of polyubiquitin chains on target proteins linked via lysine- <dig> of ubiquitin typically leads to degradation by the 26s proteasome  <cit> , whereas linkage via lysine- <dig> mediates different pathways such as internalization of membrane proteins, activation of signal transduction and dna damage repair  <cit> . the formation of lysyl-63-linked polyubiquitin chains is generated by specific combinations of e2s and e <dig> variants, which are similar to e2s except that they lack core cysteine residues required for e <dig> activity  <cit> . in addition, ubiquitination of substrates without polymerization, mono-ubiquitination, acts as a sorting signal for protein endocytosis and as a regulation factor for diverse proteins, including histones and transcription factors  <cit> .

in plant, genomic research of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana showed that there are two e1s,  <dig> e2s and more than  <dig>  predicted e3s  <cit> . although little is known about protein ubiquitination in plants compared with yeast and mammals, recent studies revealed that the plant ubiquitination pathway is involved in the regulation of morphogenesis, the circadian clock and responding to hormone or pathogen signal molecules  <cit> . despite the importance of ubiquitination in plants, much of the plant ubiquitination cascade is still unknown because of its complexity and the issues inherent to the use of arabidopsis plants for biochemical analysis. although several interactions between e2s and ring type e3s have been demonstrated in vitro using recombinant proteins expressed in escherichia coli, these efforts are hampered by the inability to obtain functional protein using conventional methods  <cit> .

with this in mind, we sought to develop a novel in vitro method to analyze the ubiquitin pathway genome-wide. the two major obstacles hindering the development of an in vitro assay for genome-wide screening are the difficulty of efficiently producing recombinant protein and the inability to detect ubiquitination in a high-throughput fashion. to address the first problem we used the wheat cell-free protein synthesis system, which has been previously reported to produce a wide range of functional arabidopsis and human proteins  <cit> . moreover, a collection of riken arabidopsis full length  cdna clones covering about 70% of arabidopsis genes is available  <cit> . using these rafl clones as templates, recombinant proteins involved in the ubiquitination pathway were expressed in the wheat cell-free system and used for several functional analyses. for screening, conventional detection methods such as immunoblot analysis or radioisotope-labeled proteins are not suitable for the detection of a large number of ubiquitination reactions. recently, a high-throughput luminescence method to detect protein ubiquitination was reported  <cit> , however this method requires purified protein and creation of specialized vectors to produce proteins. in this study, a novel in vitro assay to detect polyubiquitin chain formation was developed using wheat cell-free synthesis and a modified luminescence-based detection method. we demonstrate  creation of a simple in vitro method to detect polyubiquitination using crude recombinant e3s,  discovery of the activity of at1g <dig> by screening a ring subgroup in the reported assay, and  the polyubiquitination assay in the presence of mg <dig> demonstrated the absence of 26s proteasome-dependent protein degradation activity in wheat cell-free system.

RESULTS
detection of polyubiquitin chains on atubc <dig> e <dig> enzyme
recently, atubc <dig>  e <dig> protein has been shown to catalyze polyubiquitin chain formation without an e <dig> ligase, although atubc <dig>  e3-independent polyubiquitination activity could not be detected  <cit> . we employed atubc <dig> and atubc <dig> as model e <dig> proteins to develop a novel polyubiquitination assay. we have also demonstrated that addition of biotin ligase  and biotin to the wheat cell-free protein production system yields a single biotinylation on a target protein containing a biotin ligation site  <cit> . using this method, biotinylated recombinant atubc <dig> and atubc <dig> were synthesized and, without purification from the translation mixture, the polyubiquitination reaction was performed on the crude recombinant protein. after the reaction, biotinylated atubc <dig> and atubc <dig> were purified using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads and the polyubiquitin chain was detected by immunoblot analysis. as shown in fig 1a, atubc <dig> showed polyubiquitination, whereas atubc <dig> showed mainly monoubiquitination. interestingly, both e2s still had activity in absence of exogenous e <dig> in polyubiquitin reaction mixture , suggesting that wheat cell-free system has high endogenous e <dig> activity.

while immunoblot analysis is an excellent detection method, it is not suitable for high-throughput detection of numerous polyubiquitination reactions. initially, we attempted to use luminescent analysis, based on the alphascreen technology, to detect the polyubiquitination activity of atubc <dig> and atubc <dig>  in principle, if a polyubiquitin chain is formed by flag-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitins, it will bring into proximity the streptavidin-coated donor bead  and the protein a-conjugated acceptor bead , producing a luminescent signal . considering that the wheat cell-free system has high endogenous e <dig> activity , it may also have endogenous e <dig> and e <dig> activity. in order to avoid formation of polyubiquitin chains by an endogenous wheat germ ubiquitin pathway, purified e2s were used in this assay. as shown in fig 1c, high luminescent signal was observed in the presence of atubc <dig> in e1-dependent manner. in contrast, atubc <dig> showed low signal. the two luminescent signals were approximately consistent with immunoblot data that atubc <dig> and atubc <dig> have high and low polyubiquitination activities respectively, as demonstrated in fig 1a. these results indicate that the luminescent method can detect polyubiquitin chain formation by using the two types of ubiquitins.

ubiquitination and polyubiquitination analyses of hect-typee <dig> ligases
polyubiquitination activity of e <dig> ligases activated by the step-wise e <dig> to e <dig> cascade is well documented  <cit> . we next attempted to reconstruct this cascade in vitro and to detect the e3-formed polyubiquitin chains using our luminescent method. due to the size of hect-type e <dig> ligases, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda in arabidopsis, production of active protein by traditional expression methods may not be easy and biochemical analysis using only truncated recombinant protein has been carried out previously  <cit> . we attempted to produce full-length arabidopsis hect-type e <dig> ligase proteins using the wheat cell-free system and monitored ubiquitin-conjugation and polyubiquitination by luminescence. two genes that encode arabidopsis hect-type e <dig> ligase, upl <dig> and upl <dig>  <cit> , were analyzed in this study. we obtained upl <dig> and upl <dig> cdna from the rafl library and produced flag-tagged protein in the wheat cell-free system. ubiquitination of flag-labeled upls  was investigated by both the luminescent and immunoblot methods. the successful production of the two recombinant hect proteins was observed by immunoblot analysis  and used in the luminescence assay without purification. to detect ubiquitination of the hect proteins, upl-flags and biotinylated ubiquitin were used. when biotinylated ubiquitin is conjugated to the upl-flag, a high luminescent signal is obtained . as a result of the analysis, ubiquitin-conjugation of upl <dig> was observed . in addition, polyubiquitin chains formed by upls were detected with the luminescence assay using his-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitin. to subtract polyubiquitin chain formation from endogenous e <dig> and e <dig> in wheat cell-free system, the assay was performed without recombinant upl and only low signal was detected . as expected, luminescent signal was observed in recombinant upl <dig> and upl <dig> . although the luminescent signal of upl <dig> was lower than that of upl <dig>  the signal was still two-fold higher than the endogenous background signal. these results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis that showed distinct mobility shifts of upl <dig>  when detecting flag-tagged upls, and polyubiquitin chain formation of upl <dig> monitoring alexa488-conjugated streptavidin . comparing the amount of polyubiquitin chain formation in absence of upls , upl <dig> formed weak but distinct polyubiquitin chains in presence of atubc <dig>  these luminescent signals were consistent with immunoblot data. interestingly, polyubiquitin chains were formed by upl <dig> without supplementing exogenous e <dig> protein , suggesting that wheat germ extract has endogenous e <dig> activity as well as endogenous e <dig> activity. these data indicate that the wheat cell-free production system is able to produce high molecular weight proteins in functional forms and that our luminescence method can detect activity of hect-type e <dig> ligases without purification. this is the first data showing that full length recombinant hect-type e3s have ubiquitin-conjugating and polyubiquitination activity. taken together, the luminescent method based on the wheat cell-free system could be useful for biochemical analysis of hect-type e <dig> ligases.

detection of polyubiquitin chains by ring-type cip <dig> e <dig> ligase
it is reported that at least  <dig> predicted ring-type e <dig> ligases are encoded in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . like the hect-type e <dig>  we attempted to express and carry out the functional analysis of the ring-type e <dig> ligases. in this study, we selected cip <dig> as a model ring-type e <dig> ligase, which is reported to possess a ring finger motif and have typical features of an e <dig> ligase  <cit> . at first, polyubiquitination activity of purified cip <dig> in presence or absence of exogenous e <dig> and purified e <dig>  was investigated by luminescence. as shown in fig 3a, luminescence analysis using his-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitin showed the polyubiquitination of purified cip <dig> only when exogenous e <dig> and purified e <dig> were added to the reaction mixture. the cip8-dependent polyubiquitination was confirmed by immunoblot analyses detecting both flag-cip <dig> and his-tagged ubiquitin . on the other hand, luminescent analysis with crude cip <dig> protein showed high polyubiquitination activity both in the presence or absence of purified e <dig> , and was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with crude protein . these data indicated that, like recombinant upl <dig>  crude cip <dig> also utilized endogenous wheat extract e <dig> and e <dig> proteins, and therefore we could carry out the simple polyubiquitination analysis of e <dig> without addition of exogenous e <dig> and e <dig> proteins. furthermore, immunoblot analysis detecting purified cip <dig>  showed a mobility shift of flag-tagged cip <dig> to higher molecular weights due to ubiquitination, whereas the mobility of the e <dig> was not altered . this result indicates that the cip8-dependent polyubiquitin chains might be elongated on cip <dig> itself. this data is consistent with a recent report showing that trim5a, a typical ring-type e <dig> ligase in human, also undergoes self-ubiquitination, forming polyubiquitin chains on itself  <cit> . to clarify whether the mobility shift of cip <dig> was concomitant with polyubiquitin chain formation resulting from self-ubiquitination, we tried to detect ubiquitination of cip <dig> by the luminescent method using crude flag-cip <dig> protein and biotinylated ubiquitin. the luminescent method clearly detected the binding of biotinylated ubiquitin to flag-tagged cip <dig> both in the presence and absence of exogenous e <dig> . similar to polyubiquitin formation, the ubiquitination of cip <dig> also occurred without the addition of exogenous e <dig> protein . taken together, these data demonstrate that the luminescent method could detect formation of ring-type cip8-dependent polyubiquitin chains and self-ubiquitination of crude cip <dig> 

screening of ring-type e <dig> ligases having polyubiquitination activity
recent papers have reported that the polyubiquitin chain is an important biological regulator. identification of activity and features of e <dig> ligases offers important information about the ubiquitin-dependent regulation system. our luminescent method based on the wheat cell-free system produced a simple and high-sensitivity detection of cip8-dependent polyubiquitin chains without any purification . using these tools, we screened new e <dig> ligases for the ability to form polyubiquitin chains like cip <dig> 

the ring-type e <dig> ligases in arabidopsis were divided into  <dig> subgroups based on domain structure, and cip <dig> is categorized into subgroup  <dig> as it contains a coiled-coil domain  <cit> . eight other ring-type e3s from subgroup  <dig> were selected for screening, and the simple polyubiquitination assay was carried out with flag-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitins, and the crude recombinant ring-type e3s without addition of exogenous e <dig> and e <dig>  the screening result showed significant polyubiquitination activity of at1g <dig>  whereas other ring-e <dig> proteins were not active . immunoblot analysis of purified recombinant at1g <dig> confirmed the polyubiquitination activity and indicated that at1g <dig> was self-ubiquitinated . the polyubiquitination activity of at1g <dig> suggests that it may have a biological role for proteasome-mediated degradation like cip <dig>  <cit> . these results show that the wheat cell-free protein expression system and the luminescent ubiquitination detection method could support functional high-throughput screening of e <dig> proteins.

analysis of the wheat cell-free based ubiquitination in the presence of proteasome inhibitor
it is known that some cell extracts, such as rabbit reticulocyte or hela s- <dig> fraction, have 26s proteasome-dependent proteolytic activity  <cit> . based on the presence of endogenous e <dig> and e <dig> ubiquitination and polyubiquitination in the wheat cell-free system, it is expected that the 26s proteasome activity will be very low . it was previously reported that the wheat germ extract had little 26s proteasome-dependent protein degradation activity  <cit> . thus, we determined whether the wheat cell-free system contains active 26s proteasome. using the crude recombinant proteins that formed polyubiquitin chains in this study, the polyubiquitination reaction was carried out in presence or absence of mg <dig>  and accrual of the polyubiquitinated recombinant proteins and its polyubiquitin chain was estimated. as shown in fig  <dig>  the amounts of ubc <dig>  upl <dig>  upl <dig> and at1g <dig>  and of its polyubiquitin chains  were hardly altered by mg <dig> treatment. this result indicates that the proteolytic activity of the 26s proteasome in the wheat cell-free system was below the detection level. thus, the wheat cell-free system could be suitable for ubiquitination analysis.

discussion
the ubiquitin signal is an important protein modification in eukaryotes. binding of a single ubiquitin to a target protein, mono-ubiquitination, is essential for membrane trafficking, protein functions and protein-protein interaction  <cit> . as for polyubiquitination, both lys-48- and lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains have been well characterized in mammals and yeast. lys- <dig> linked chains cause proteolysis of target proteins  <cit> , and lys- <dig> linked chains regulate signal transduction such as cellular localization of protein or protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in mammals, the multi-functional activities of nf-κb are regulated by the lys- <dig> linked chain  <cit> . in plants, the function of the lys- <dig> linked chain is still obscure. however, arabidopsis e <dig> and its variants promote formation of the lys- <dig> linked chain  <cit> , suggesting that the lys- <dig> linked chain in plant cells might also function similar to animal cells. hence, comprehensive analysis of the ubiquitin-related plant proteins would open a door for elucidation of the plant ubiquitin pathway. in this study, we developed a simple and highly sensitive ubiquitination assay method by combination of the wheat cell-free protein synthesis system and luminescent detection. in general, in vivo protein production requires many time-consuming steps such as vector construction, cell culture and purification to obtain the recombinant protein. in contrast, this cell-free based luminescence method could analyze a large amount of ubiquitin reactions without these steps.

using this method, we conveniently detected polyubiquitin chain formation of e <dig> and e3s by using two tagged ubiquitins . the result of polyubiquitination analysis of the e2s obtained from luminescent-based detection method was verified by immunoblot analysis . our analysis also produced recombinant protein of hect-type e <dig> ligases without truncation and detected their ubiquitin-conjugation and polyubiquitination activity by luminescent analysis . the ubiquitin-conjugation of upl <dig> was not observed when a reductant was added to the reaction , suggesting that upl <dig> formed a thioester bond with ubiquitin. in addition, the model ring-type e <dig> cip <dig> possessed high polyubiquitin formation activity without substrate, consistent with what was reported previously  <cit> . crude recombinant cip <dig> formed polyubiquitin chains in the absence of exogenous e <dig> and e <dig> , suggesting that the wheat cell-free system might include enough endogenous e <dig> and e <dig> activity. it was reported that wheat germ extracts have only a partial ubiquitin pathway  <cit> . although the process to isolate wheat germ extract is different from the conventional methods  <cit> , this report strongly supports the existence of endogenous ubiquitin pathway in our wheat cell-free system. indeed, luminescent analysis using crude recombinant protein showed slight polyubiquitin chain formation even in absence of recombinant e <dig> , indicating that wheat cell-free system might include not only e <dig> and e <dig>  but e3s or other factors that accelerates the polyubiquitin chain formation. further, quantitative immunoblot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibody showed that free ubiquitin was also present in wheat germ extract at a concentration of at least  <dig> nm . this is similar to the ubiquitin concentration supplied in the in vitro assay. although we developed a convenient screening method to detect e <dig> activity in this study, removal of the endogenous ubiquitin and ubiquitin related components such as e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  would yield a more sensitive assay. however, wheat cell-free system does not have 26s proteasome proteolytic activity , indicating that using crude recombinant protein is sufficient for in vitro ubiquitination assays.

by using this method, we found that a previously uncharacterized ring type e <dig>  at1g <dig>  possessed high polyubiquitination activity without exogenous e <dig> and e <dig> proteins . this result suggested that the method developed here is expected to find the activity of other unknown e <dig> ligases such as at1g <dig>  despite having only 32% sequence similarity, the e3s cip <dig> and at1g <dig> showed similar biochemical functions. polyubiquitin chains formed by cip <dig> and at1g <dig> elongated on themselves, while another report showed that polyubiquitin chains were formed on e <dig> before transferring them to substrates  <cit> . this reflects that the pattern of polyubiquitin chain formation differs between individual e3s and that the detailed mechanisms are still unknown. these studies suggest the importance of functional analysis using active recombinant proteins. although we developed a simple screen using crude recombinant e3s in absence of exogenous e <dig> and e <dig> , this method could not detect the activity of some e <dig> ligases that were unable to utilize endogenous ubiquitination components in wheat cell-free system. the polyubiquitination activity of at5g <dig> recombinant protein, expressed in e. coli in the presence of atubc <dig>  <cit> , was not active in our in vitro system , suggesting that in some cases exogenous e <dig> and/or other components are necessary additions. such modifications to the ubiquitination assays detailed here would help elucidate the biochemical features of e3s .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we found that the wheat cell-free system was an excellent expression system to produce recombinant protein efficiently and to carry out in vitro ubiquitination assays without the interference of proteolytic activity. coupled with luminescent analysis, detection of these ubiquitin reactions in the crude translation reaction mixture was possible. thus, this method should be helpful for solving the complicated ubiquitin pathway in plant.
