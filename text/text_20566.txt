BACKGROUND
sperm cells can be considered as semi-autonomous organisms having their own unique genomes and living lives that are, in part, independent of the organisms that produced them. sperm are exceedingly variable across animal taxa in terms of morphology, motility, and lifespan. one seemingly invariant feature is that a sperm cell's active life must initiate with precise timing. precocious activation may result in premature consumption of stored energy or interfere with efficient fertilization. belated activation may allow competing sperm to gain the advantage in the race to fertilize the ova. in many cases, activation coincides with sperm release from the male. for example, in sea urchins, a longstanding model for sperm function, na+ enters the sperm when they are released into seawater. a simultaneous ph spike stimulates motility and respiration through a signal transduction pathway that includes spikes in ca2+, camp, and camp dependent kinases. the result is the activation of dynein atpase in the flagellum and increased mitochondrial activity  <cit> . the sudden ionic flux that accompanies release into seawater is the cue that initiates sperm motility in sea urchins.

in internal fertilizing species, the sperm also require a cue to initiate activity. the cue is often a signaling molecule. in many mammals, bicarbonate serves as the cue, inducing a ca2+ influx, camp accumulation, camp dependent protein kinase a activity, and increased motility and respiration  <cit> . thus, even though sea urchins and mammals are distantly related and the signals for sperm activation are different, some of the cellular processes involved in sperm activation are similar.

here, we are concerned with the cellular mechanisms that regulate sperm activation in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. like all nematode sperm, those from c. elegans are amoeboid, and attainment of activity coincides with the developmental transition from spermatid to spermatozoon . in hermaphrodites, spermiogenesis occurs as the spermatids enter the sperm storage chamber, or spermatheca. in males, spermiogenesis occurs during copulation as the spermatids encounter seminal fluid  <cit> . in both cases, the timing of spermiogenesis is critical. for instance, belated activation may result in the spermatids being swept from the reproductive tract by passing eggs  <cit> , whereas prematurely activated spermatozoa within the male reproductive tract impede sperm transfer  <cit> . the signaling molecule that initiates spermiogenesis in c. elegans is unknown, but in a manner similar to the species discussed above, sperm activation in c. elegans appears to involve the influx of cations  <cit> , a brief elevation in ph  <cit> , and the release of intracellular ca2+  <cit> .

the control of c. elegans spermiogenesis involves a number of gene products. the signal to activate is transduced through a pathway that includes the genes spe- <dig>  spe- <dig>  <cit> , spe- <dig>  <cit> , spe- <dig>  <cit> , and spe- <dig>  <cit> . mutations in these genes result in arrest at the spermatid stage in hermaphrodite produced self-sperm. curiously, mutant males are fertile, and the arrested hermaphrodite produced self-sperm can be "rescued" when exposed to seminal fluid from males, which, along with other data, suggests that this "spe-8" group of genes amplifies the activation signal for hermaphrodite self sperm  <cit> . in vitro, the arrest associated with mutations in the spe- <dig> group genes can be overcome by inducing one of the events that occurs downstream of the signal transduction pathway: elevation of ph. this is accomplished by treating the cells with the weak base triethanolamine  <cit> . thus, c. elegans sperm possess a complex spermiogenesis pathway that ensures the timely activation of spermatids.

it is now clear that spermatid activation in c. elegans also involves negative regulation. the propensity to undergo spermiogenesis is so great that an inhibitory pathway is required to prevent premature progression through this important developmental transition. this inhibitory pathway includes spe- <dig>  a large screen for mutations that suppress the sterile phenotype of spe- <dig> identified a number of mutations in spe- <dig>  which result in premature spermatid activation and in suppression of mutations of the spe- <dig> group genes  <cit> . spe- <dig> inhibits spermiogenesis until the activation signal is transduced through the spe- <dig> group gene products. spe- <dig> also functions earlier in spermatogenesis in the packaging of major sperm protein  into the fibrous body-membranous organelles , which are unique to the sperm cells  <cit> . here, we report on the inhibitory function of spe- <dig> on spermatid activation. spe- <dig>  a homolog of the human presenilin gene ps <dig>  had been known for its role in msp packaging in the fb-mos early in spermatogenesis  <cit> . our investigation focuses on a hypomorphic spe- <dig> allele isolated in the same suppressor screen that produced the spe- <dig> suppressor alleles. like the spe- <dig> suppressor alleles, spe- <dig> suppresses mutations in the spe- <dig> group genes and results in premature spermatid activation.

RESULTS
genetic mapping places hc <dig> right of center on chromosome i
we initially mapped hc <dig> to chromosome i using single nucleotide polymorphisms from the polymorphic hawaiian strain cb <dig>  linkage to chromosome i was unequivocal . we then undertook mapping with snp loci across chromosome i. the calculated map ratios for each of the snp loci analyzed are shown in fig.  <dig>  the second order equation for the best fit curve  has a minimum at  <dig> , which is a rough estimate of the locus. based upon the fact that the snp loci at  <dig>   and  <dig>   showed almost no recombination with the hawaiian chromosomes, we chose to conduct a three factor mapping cross with markers that flank this region: dpy- <dig> and unc- <dig>  located at  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the cross was performed in a spe- <dig> background, so the hc <dig> mutant phenotype was fertility. we recovered  <dig> recombinant f <dig> progeny:  <dig> recombination events occurred between dpy- <dig> and hc <dig> , and  <dig> recombination events occurred between hc <dig> and unc- <dig> . based upon these data, hc <dig> resides at  <dig>  m.u. on chromosome i .

hc <dig> is an allele of spe-4
due to its proximity to spe- <dig> at  <dig>  on chromosome i, we decided to perform a complementation test to determine if hc <dig> is an allele of spe- <dig>  worms with the hc196/spe- <dig> genotype were sterile , indicating that hc <dig> is an allele of spe- <dig>  there are six other alleles of spe- <dig>  and all are sterile . the fact that hc <dig> homozygotes are partially fertile suggests that the allele is hypomorphic and that these worms have some spe- <dig> function. interestingly, the trans-heterozygote, composed of a hypomorphic allele over a null allele , was sterile . apparently, spe- <dig> activity from only a single hypomorphic allele is too little to allow functional sperm production.

worms were reared at 25°c.

the identity of hc <dig> as an allele of spe- <dig> was supported by transformation rescue experiments. n <dig> worms transformed with myo-2::gfp and a pcr product containing wild-type spe- <dig> and its flanking dna ]; see methods) were mated to dpy- <dig> hc196; spe- <dig> unc- <dig> hermaphrodites. we scored the fertility of f <dig> worms expressing gfp  and a dumpy phenotype  but lacking an uncoordinated phenotype . the dumpy transformants had significantly larger brood sizes than did non-transgenic dumpy animals , showing that the wild-type spe- <dig> transgene rescued the hc <dig> fertility defect.

* these were dpy- <dig> hc196; spe- <dig> unc-22/++ or dpy- <dig> hc196; ++ worms transformed with the transgene zqex <dig> . worms were reared at 25°c.

finally, we sequenced spe- <dig> from our hc <dig> strain and identified a missense mutation. every base pair was covered by at least two sequencing reads from a cloned region of hc <dig> dna containing spe- <dig>  the mutation was confirmed by two additional sequencing reads on an independent pcr product amplified with primers f <dig> and r <dig> . the mutation alters a histidine residue that is conserved in every nematode spe- <dig> homolog known . spe- <dig> is an ortholog of the human presenilin gene ps <dig>  but a paralog two other ps <dig> orthologs in the c. elegans genome: sel- <dig> and hop- <dig>  the spe- <dig> amino acid position affected by the hc <dig> mutation is conserved in hop- <dig> but not sel- <dig>  our mutation lies in a membrane spanning domain, and the majority of the mutations isolated in spe- <dig>  lie within  <dig> amino acids of hc <dig> . indeed, the hc <dig> missense mutation is nearby in the same transmembrane domain, suggesting that this domain is important to spe- <dig> function, even though the catalytic aspartates involved in the proteolytic presenilin- <dig> function are located downstream .

in an attempt to uncover additional spe- <dig> suppressor alleles, we investigated a collection of spe- <dig> suppressor mutants isolated in the same mutagenesis that generated spe- <dig>  <cit> . because spe- <dig> males produce very few cross progeny, we mated heterozygous males  to hermaphrodites of the other suppressor strains . the f <dig> were isolated and kept at 25°c. none of the additional alleles tested resulted in fertile f <dig> progeny . the fact that all the additional alleles complement spe- <dig> indicates that none of the additional suppressor mutations tested were suppressor alleles of spe- <dig>  as controls, we tested three spe- <dig> alleles that suppress the sterility of spe- <dig>  <cit> , and all of them complemented hc <dig> as well. the absence of additional alleles is curious, given the fact that  <dig> suppressor alleles of spe- <dig> were isolated in the spe- <dig> suppression mutagenesis that produced spe- <dig>  <cit> . at  <dig> base pairs, the coding sequence of spe- <dig> is a bigger target for mutation than that of spe- <dig> at  <dig> base pairs, so we expected to find multiple spe- <dig> suppressor alleles. perhaps spe- <dig> plays a more central role in the inhibitory pathway or spe- <dig> has fewer amino acids critical to the inhibitory pathway function.

the brood sizes were measured in a spe- <dig> background at 25°c.

* complementation tests for these alleles were conducted by paul muhlrad  <cit> 

spe- <dig> is a recessive bypass suppressor of spermiogenesis pathway mutations and has a conditional spe phenotype on its own
worms homozygous for spe- <dig> are sterile at 25°c, unless they are also homozygous for spe- <dig> . this suppression of spe- <dig> sterility is a recessive phenotype, as spe-4/+ are sterile in a spe- <dig> background. in an otherwise wild-type background, spe- <dig> worms have reduced fertility that is influenced by temperature: they produce five times more progeny at 20°c than they do at 25°c . this fertility deficit is a due to a sperm defect, because the fertility of spe- <dig> hermaphrodites increases after males supply sperm at mating . furthermore, the spe- <dig> phenotype is recessive; spe-4/+; spe-27/+ worms have wild-type fertility .

comparing the spe- <dig> suppression phenotype with its own phenotype in a wild-type spe- <dig> genetic background suggests that spe- <dig> is epistatic to spe- <dig>  the fertility of the double mutant more closely resembles spe- <dig> than it does spe- <dig> . this argument assumes that the suppression and sterile phenotypes are brought about by the same mechanism. if they are due to different mechanisms, then the epistatic relationship between these genes is not obvious from our data.

we were interested in the mechanism by which spe- <dig> suppresses spe- <dig> sterility. to test whether the interaction between the two genes is specific, we assessed the ability of spe- <dig> to suppress the sterility of mutations in the spermiogenesis genes spe- <dig>  spe- <dig>  and spe- <dig> . in each case, spe- <dig> restored fertility to the spermiogenesis gene mutants . therefore, the suppression phenotype of spe- <dig> is not allele or gene specific, suggesting that it bypasses the spermiogenesis pathway in a manner similar to the spe- <dig> suppressor alleles described by muhlrad and ward  <cit> .

we also tested three putative null spe- <dig> alleles for suppression of spe- <dig>  these three alleles produce a sterile phenotype. one is a missense mutation , while the other two are molecular nulls: hc <dig> , and q <dig>  . in each case, the spe-4; spe- <dig> double worms were sterile . this result was not surprising, given that these spe- <dig> mutations cause spermatocyte arrest and the virtual absence of spermatids available to undergo spermiogenesis  <cit> . what was surprising was that the heterozygous state of each of the three alleles did suppress spe- <dig> . the suppression of spe- <dig> by heterozygous spe- <dig> alleles that are null suggests that a simple reduction  of spe- <dig> function is sufficient for suppression. it is interesting that suppression by spe-4/+ resulted in larger broods than either of the two molecular nulls, suggesting that spe- <dig> is not a null allele, even though it induces complete sterility. its residual function is only apparent in the suppression phenotype. furthermore, the trans-heterozygote, dpy- <dig> spe- <dig> +/+ spe- <dig> unc-15; spe- <dig> unc- <dig> also suppressed spe- <dig> , which is of interest because the trans-heterozygote was sterile when two both copies of the spe- <dig> gene were wild type .

worms were reared at 25°c

spe- <dig> causes multiple sperm defects including premature spermiogenesis
mutant spe- <dig> hermaphrodites produce very few progeny at 25°c . we mated these hermaphrodites to fer-1; him- <dig> males to see if more of their sperm would become functional after exposure to seminal fluid from fer- <dig> males, whose own sperm are defective. such is the case with spe- <dig> group mutant hermaphrodite sperm, which activate and become functional when exposed to male seminal fluid  <cit> . we examined seven spe- <dig> hermaphrodites that had been paired with sterile fer- <dig> males: they produced an average of  <dig>  progeny. therefore, some of the spermatids within spe- <dig> hermaphrodites are similar to those in spe- <dig> group mutant hermaphrodites: they cannot activate unless exposed to male seminal fluid.

we also examined sperm from male spe-4; him- <dig> males. compared to him- <dig> males, spe-4; him- <dig> male worms contained a large number of spermatocytes in the seminal vesicle where only spermatids should be found , indicating that the hc <dig> mutation is an impediment to meiotic division, which is also a characteristic of the non-suppressor spe- <dig> mutations  <cit> . some spermatocytes do successfully negotiate the meiotic divisions, and while mutant males accumulated spermatids, they also contained spermatozoa. in fact, nearly 20% of their sperm were crawling spermatozoa . typically, males store only spermatids, which undergo spermiogenesis after exposure to seminal fluid at ejaculation. the existence of spermatozoa within virgin males shows that they failed to pause in the spermatid stage. furthermore, spe- <dig> males are nearly infertile, producing only small numbers of cross progeny even given  <dig> hours or more to mate. such infertility may be due to premature spermatid activation because crawling spermatozoa impede sperm transfer during copulation  <cit> , demonstrating the importance of the proper timing of sperm activation.

in contrast, not all the spermatids stored within spe- <dig> males appear capable of undergoing spermiogenesis. the ability of sperm to undergo spermiogenesis can be examined in vitro using pronase, a collection of proteases which apparently cleave one or more cell surface components and thereby induce spermiogenesis  <cit> . while more than 90% of the spermatids in him- <dig> males activate to spermatozoa in the presence of pronase, only ~50% of the sperm from spe- <dig> males activated in pronase exposure . because 20% of the sperm these males contained was activated prior to exposure, pronase treatment only activated 30% of the sperm. therefore, almost 50% of the mutant sperm failed to activate. however, we did not observe any sperm that appeared "stalled" in the spiky intermediate stage of spermiogenesis. remaining as spiky intermediates is a characteristic of the sperm from spe- <dig> group mutants when exposed to pronase  <cit> . thus, sperm from spe- <dig> mutants share some characteristics with the spe- <dig> group mutants that they suppress, but not all their characteristics.

we had great difficulty obtaining cross progeny from spe-4; him- <dig> males, so we tested their fertility by pairing them with fer- <dig> hermaphrodites that had been raised at 25°c. the fer- <dig> mutation disrupts sperm function: fer- <dig> hermaphrodites are self-sterile and lose their defective self-sperm rapidly as they are swept from the reproductive tracts by passing unfertilized oocytes  <cit> . in  <dig> matings between individual spe-4; him- <dig> males each with four fer- <dig> unc- <dig> hermaphrodites,  <dig> males failed to sire any progeny, and together, the males averaged  <dig>  progeny each . the males that sired no progeny actually did transfer sperm to the fer- <dig> unc- <dig> hermaphrodites, as evidenced by sperm within the mated hermaphrodites' spermathecae that were never found in unmated controls . therefore, at least some of the sperm from the mutant males were transferred during mating and crawled to the spermatheca, but they were unable to fertilize the oocytes.

spe- <dig> is a member of an inhibitory pathway preventing premature spermiogenesis
because reduction of spe- <dig> function bypasses the spermiogenesis activation pathway, spe- <dig> appears to be the second member of a spermiogenesis inhibition pathway. this pathway prevents progression through spermiogenesis until relieved by the signal transduced through the activation pathway consisting, at least in part, of spe- <dig>  spe- <dig>  spe- <dig>  spe- <dig>  and spe- <dig> . the founding member of the inhibitory pathway is spe- <dig>  a casein kinase i that is proposed to maintain inhibition through phosphorylation  <cit> . spe- <dig> has multiple potential ck <dig> phosphorylation sites as predicted by the elm server   <cit> , so spe- <dig> could be a direct target of spe- <dig> ck <dig> activity.

the role of spe- <dig> in the prevention of spermiogenesis may occur by several different mechanisms, but our results suggest that reduced spe- <dig> function fosters precocious spermiogenesis. one possible mechanism involves the proteolytic function of the human ps <dig>  a member of the γ-secretase complex whose members are located in the membranes of several cellular compartments including the golgi. more than  <dig> mutations in ps <dig> contribute to early onset familial alzheimer's disease through abnormal deposition of the amyloid β-peptide  in the brain  <cit> . many of the ps <dig> mutations originally deemed to be gain of function are now thought to be loss of function lesions that decrease proteolytic efficiency but increase the ratio of the 42-residue to the 40-residue variant of aβ  <cit> . we propose a model where the fer- <dig> protein is a target of spe- <dig> proteolytic activity . spermatids contain two isoforms of fer- <dig>  which likely result from proteolysis  <cit> . the human γ-secretase complex normally targets type i transmembrane proteins for proteolysis  <cit> , but fer- <dig> is a type ii membrane protein  <cit> , casting doubt upon fer- <dig> as a target. however, we propose fer- <dig> as a spe- <dig> target because  spe- <dig> is the most divergent ps <dig> family member and may have different target specificities,  both spe- <dig> and fer- <dig> exist in the mo membrane, and  fer- <dig> is cleaved during sperm maturation. in wild-type spermatids, activation likely happens when spe- <dig> activity abates, perhaps as a result of decreasing spe- <dig> function, resulting in an altered fer- <dig> isoform ratio that promotes spermiogenesis . the hypothesis that fer- <dig> is a spe- <dig> target requires further investigation.

regulation of ca2+ homeostasis is another potential ps1-like function of spe- <dig> that may play a role in the inhibition of spermiogenesis. ps <dig> mutations have been shown to perturb ca2+ homeostasis in human cells  <cit> . this perturbation may occur through a disruption in phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  signaling  <cit> . pip <dig> generally plays an important role in ion channel modulation  <cit> . alternatively, spe- <dig> might act as a ca2+ leak channel itself  <cit> . if spe- <dig> regulates ca2+ homeostasis in spermatids either directly or through a pip2-like intermediate, loss of function spe- <dig> mutations may affect sperm activation. spe- <dig> resides in the mo membrane, the same location as trp- <dig>  a ca2+ channel   <cit> . it is not clear if trp- <dig> functions in spermiogenesis, but intracellular chelation of ca2+ prevents spermiogenesis  <cit> , indicating that spermiogenesis is ca2+ dependent. this leads to the hypothesis that spe- <dig> maintains ca2+ sequestration in the spermatid phase and reduced spe- <dig> activity allows ca2+ entry into the cytosol . the exact role of spe- <dig> in the inhibition of spermiogenesis remains to be determined.

the inhibitory pathway that consists of spe- <dig> and spe- <dig> likely contains multiple other genes and involves the membranous organelles. the spe- <dig> suppression screen that generated the suppressor alleles of spe- <dig> and spe- <dig> produced at least four other mutated genes, two and perhaps more of which are not previously known spe genes . both spe- <dig> and fer- <dig> reside in the mos  <cit> . the mos exist in a complex with the fibrous bodies to form the fb-mo complexes that function to package the major sperm proteins . msp packaging is deficient for the likely null alleles of both spe- <dig> and spe- <dig>  <cit> . the fbs disassemble in the spermatid as the msp is released, but the mos remain and fuse with the plasma membrane during spermiogenesis  <cit> . therefore, the mo is an important site of activity during spermiogenesis, and it is conceivable that the machinery of the spermiogenesis inhibition pathway resides in the mos.

it appears that the spermiogenesis inhibition pathway is important for normal sperm function. males with the spe- <dig> mutation were largely sterile, even though mutant hermaphrodites were partly fertile. the male form of sterility likely derives from several sources. one is the fact that many mutant spermatids do not activate . therefore, even though some spermatids activate prematurely, others apparently cannot activate at all. another likely source of sterility is the obstruction that active spermatozoa pose to sperm transfer  <cit> . finally some mutant sperm exhibit a fertilization defect. perhaps these spermatozoa underwent spermiogenesis so prematurely that they were not properly organized for fertilization. this suggests that the timing of sperm activation is not only important for interaction with the external environment, but also for correct assembly of the spermatozoon. in our studies with spe- <dig>  premature activation results in only a small number of functional sperm; the majority are defective.

spe- <dig> sequence divergence
we performed an analysis of the similarities of the spe- <dig> protein sequences from four nematodes along with those of sel- <dig> and hop- <dig>  the two other c. elegans ps <dig> homologs, and human ps <dig> . sel- <dig> is the most similar of the nematode proteins to human ps <dig>  hop- <dig> is more diverged, and the four spe- <dig> proteins cluster together. therefore, it would appear that hop- <dig> and spe- <dig> are the result of duplication events since the separation of the human and nematode lineages. the spe- <dig> like genes are the most divergent of the ps <dig> orthologs, and because brugia malayi has likely been separated from caenorhabditis spp. for several hundred million years, the spe- <dig> type presenilins apparently have an ancient specialization that likely involves sperm function.

CONCLUSIONS
spe- <dig> is the second member of a potentially new inhibitory pathway that prevents premature spermiogenesis in c. elegans. spe- <dig> was isolated in the same suppressor screen that produced multiple suppressor alleles of spe- <dig>  this screen identified mutations that restored partial fertility to spe- <dig> hermaphrodites. the suppressor alleles of both genes bypass the spermiogenesis signal transduction pathway to which spe- <dig> belongs, resulting in premature spermiogenesis. in addition to spe- <dig> and spe- <dig>  the inhibitory pathway involves multiple other genes: we are investigating  <dig> other suppressor mutations, at least two of which do not map to known spe genes .

our results suggest that spe- <dig> affects multiple aspects of sperm development. earlier results showed that it aids in the packaging of msp in primary spermatocytes  <cit> . we show that spe- <dig> is also involved in spermiogenesis, and that one of the functions is inhibitory, preventing premature spermiogenesis until the spermiogenesis activation signal is received by the spermatid. the defects we observed in spe- <dig> mutants include  accumulation of excess spermatocytes,  premature activation of some spermatids, but  an inability of other spermatids to activate, although many defective hermaphrodite produced self-spermatids can be transactivated male seminal fluid. finally some male sperm display a fertilization defect , even though they navigate successfully to the spermatheca. this constellation of defects is difficult to explain. it is as if the spe- <dig> phenotypic trajectory for spermatids is binary. either the spermatids fail to activate, or they activate prematurely resulting in some normal sperm and others that cannot fertilize. the fact that many mutant spermatozoa are incapable of fertilization suggests that the timing of spermiogenesis is very important. premature spermiogenesis may preclude proper segregation of cellular components required for fertilization.

the spe- <dig> mutation described here should allow us to gain a better understanding of the cellular function of this presenilin homolog. it retains the most function of any spe- <dig> allele to be studied, and its newly-discovered role inhibiting spermiogenesis was unexpected, given its msp packaging function early in spermatogenesis. the inhibitory role spe- <dig> plays in spermiogenesis may involve known proteolytic and/or calcium regulatory aspects of presenilin function, or it may involve yet-to-be discovered presenilin functions.
