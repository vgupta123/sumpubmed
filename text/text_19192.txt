BACKGROUND
maize  is an important crop for food, feed and industry. moreover, it is a model genetic system with many advantages, including its great levels of phenotypic and genetic diversity  <cit> . identifying the natural allelic variations that lead to this phenotypic diversity will contribute to the improvement of agronomic traits in maize breeding. however, dissecting quantitative traits poses numerous challenges that make gene identification more difficult, including the limitations of molecular biology and bioinformatics tools  <cit> . rapid developments in genome-wide association mapping, combined with an extensive array of genome resources and technologies, have increased the power and accuracy to dissect complex traits and identify alleles associated with quantitative trait loci  for important agronomic traits  <cit> . recently, association mapping has become an influential approach for dissecting complex traits of interest. distinct from the genetic analyses in segregating populations, genome-wide association study  is based on the accurate phenotyping of a particular trait in a huge set of individuals that are widely unrelated . for this reason, association mapping has been extensively used to study the genetic bases of complex traits in plant and animal systems  <cit> .

dissecting the genetic bases of different traits is the foundation of trait improvement; however, despite the recent advancements in this area, very little is known about the genetic architecture of many adaptive traits in maize  <cit> , especially resistance to northern corn leaf blight  and several other diseases. nclb is caused by a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen, exserohilum turcicum   <cit> . this disease is prevalent in maize growing areas worldwide and is associated with moderate-to-severe yield losses  <cit> . a severe nclb infection prior to flowering may cause >  <dig> % losses in maize final yields  <cit> . the most economical and effective strategy for managing nclb is the use of genetic resistance. the genetics of nclb resistance have been extensively studied using biparental populations but are still poorly understood because of several factors, including low marker densities and the small population sizes used in many studies. a qtl analysis typically produces a large confidence interval, and it is usually uncertain whether a qtl corresponds to one or multiple linked genes  <cit> . until recently, only a small number of causal genes underlying large-effect qtls have been identified and cloned in cereals  <cit> .

in view of the potential power of association mapping to dissect the genetics of complex traits, and the problems of qtl mapping, this study was undertaken to shed light on the genetic architecture of nclb resistance and to identify resistance-associated genes in globally collected diverse maize germplasm.

RESULTS
phenotypic diversity
a global collection of  <dig> diverse inbred lines from the international maize and wheat improvement center  germplasm collection was used for association mapping . three related nclb traits, mean rating, high rating and the area under the disease progress curve , were adopted to comprehensively evaluate the resistance to nclb in association panel in  <dig> environments . the analysis of variance for nclb resistance revealed significant differences  and high heritabilities for all of the traits under investigation . correlation results showed high positive associations between these traits. a maximum correlation value of  <dig>  was observed between the mean rating and audpc, whereas the lowest value  was observed between the high rating and audpc. no line was observed to be completely resistant to this disease, and most of the lines fell into the middle category . the five highly resistant inbred lines were cimbl <dig>  cml <dig>  cimbl <dig>  cml <dig> and cimbl <dig>  whereas the most susceptible lines were cml <dig>  cml <dig> and cimbl <dig> . these lines can be used as controls in future nclb phenotyping studies and as parents to develop biparental populations for molecular breeding and marker-assisted selection.table  <dig> analysis of variance, heritability and correlation

familial relatedness among lines
the  <dig>  markers used in this study were used in different analyses, including principal component analyses , structure  and kinship  analyses, to determine the relationships among the individuals in this association panel. the first  <dig> principal components in this association panel were shown to control  <dig>  % of the cumulative variance, with each of them account for  <dig>  %- <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance . we also analyzed the data using structure software to determine familial relatedness, and three subgroups were observed with > <dig> % possibility in each group . the k analysis also revealed that the  <dig>  markers controlled  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the total genetic variance for audpc, mean rating and high rating, respectively .

genetic basis revealed by gwas
the snp-based gwas was performed using mixed linear model  with rare alleles  excluded, and both population structure  and kinship  were taken into account to avoid spurious associations. as is shown by the quantile-quantile plots  and manhattan plots , significant trait-marker associations that reached bonferroni correction of p ≤  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  were observed. the number of significant markers revealed for audpc was  <dig>  whereas  <dig> and  <dig> markers were associated with mean rating and high rating, respectively . the number of significant loci varied from chromosome to chromosome, and each locus explained a small portion  of phenotypic variation. the maximum candidate loci were observed on chromosome  <dig> for the audpc and mean rating, whereas chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> each had seven significant loci for high rating. based on the physical locations of significant snps on the b <dig> reference genome sequence, the concerning candidate genes lying in the significant loci were identified, which included five, seven and seven genes conferring resistance for audpc, mean rating and high rating, respectively. in total twelve unique genes were detected for at least one resistance trait. five identical genes associated with two or three resistance traits were observed as revealed by their strong phenotypic correlations, which included one gene on chromosome  <dig> , two genes on chromosome  <dig>  and two genes on chromosome  <dig> . more importantly, functional annotations of the five genes showed that three of them related to plant defense. for example, grmzm2g <dig> was annotated as the sant domain-associated protein, which played an important role in disease resistance  <cit> . grmzm2g <dig> encoded antifreeze protein and may play direct role in plant defense  <cit> . grmzm2g <dig> encoded dna-binding wrky, which can cis regulate defense genes by signal transduction under biotic stress conditions  <cit> .fig.  <dig> manhattan plots and qq plots resulting from the snp-based gwas for audpc, mean rating and high rating. manhattan plots for area under disease progress curve , mean rating and high rating are shown in a, b and c, respectively. qq plots for area under disease progress curve , mean rating and high rating are shown in d, e and f, respectively. the genes that reach bonferroni correction of p ≤  <dig>  × 10− <dig> are listed, and ig stands for intergenic which means no gene is identified

haplotype-based association studies
gene-based haplotypes were constructed within the  <dig>  genes which had at least  <dig> snps. on average a set of  <dig>  haplotypes was defined in each of the  <dig>  genes in present study. the haplotype analysis using these loci and phenotypic data from three disease parameters  identified ten loci associated with resistance to nclb. of these loci, seven, five and seven were significantly associated with audpc, mean rating and high rating , respectively . among the significant loci, four possible candidate genes  were significantly associated with all three disease parameters , and three of them were annotated as resistance-related proteins . when comparing the loci identified by single-snp and haplotype-based associations, identical loci were also detected. for example, two candidate genes  were significantly associated with at least two disease parameters based on both haplotype-based and snp-based association analyses.fig.  <dig> manhattan plots and qq plots resulting from the haplotype-based gwas for audpc, mean rating and high rating. manhattan plots for area under disease progress curve , mean rating and high rating are shown in a, b and c, respectively. qq plots for area under disease progress curve , mean rating and high rating are shown in d, e and f, respectively



anderson-darling  test for genome scanning
the snp data were further used for genome-wide scanning via a-d test to reveal the sources of resistance to nclb. the total population was divided into three subgroups as described in the methods section. trait-marker association was performed by a-d test for each subgroup. as shown in the qq and manhattan plots , we found notable positive associations in subgroup  <dig>  in which > <dig> significant markers associated with different disease parameters were observed. in contrast, few significant associations were revealed in subgroup  <dig> and only small number of significant associations was observed in subgroup  <dig>  the predicted genes located within associated snps were identified using the maizegdb genome browser  <cit>  or the http://ensembl.gramene.org/zea_mays/info/index browser  <cit> . here we listed  <dig> genes which were associated with at least two or three of the disease parameters . among the predicted genes,  <dig> were related to plant defense , which included antifreeze protein, pr transcriptional factor and a receptor-like kinase similar to those involved in basal defenses, and could be evaluated as potential candidate resistance genes. more importantly, when compared the defense genes with those identified by other two methods in present study , we found grmzm2g <dig> was identical for all three analyses, and grmzm2g <dig> was identical for a-d test and single-marker based associations.table  <dig> a subset of  <dig> snp loci found to be associated with resistance to nclb by anderson-darling test



discussion
resistance to nclb is a complex trait, and we know comparatively little about the genetic architecture in maize  <cit> . in the present study, a large number of lines were used to dissect the genetic architecture of resistance to nclb. the germplasm covered a considerable amount of the genetic diversity found globally in maize, including  <dig> inbred lines from different sources, which were, most importantly, from multiple locations, allowing us to depict a clear global image. the high heritabilities of traits associated with resistance to nclb revealed the potential of this panel for precisely mapping nclb resistance genes. however, the population structure of the association panel is an important factor for gwas. to minimize spurious correlations and associations attributable to genetic non-independence or genome-wide linkage disequilibrium , we unified significant population structure information  and pairwise relative kinship relationships among lines  into the statistical model  <cit> . these results can significantly control the false positives, but the q + k model was extremely strict, and it was hard to find significant loci when using the bonferroni threshold as the cutoff . therefore, we used a pca + k instead of q + k model and observed significant loci for this disease. we further confirmed our results through different analysis methods, including a haplotype-based gwas and a-d tests for genome scanning. we observed several genes using different statistical approaches and determined that some of the genes were commonly associated with all of the traits based on highly correlated phenotypic data. furthermore, the genes detected in our investigation caused minor effects and controlled a small portion of phenotypic variation. therefore, we concluded that resistance to nclb is controlled by several genes or qtls, each of which has a minor effect, and that no single major gene that controls nclb resistance is present in this germplasm.

several qualitative genes have been identified in tropical and temperate germplasm backgrounds that confer resistance to nclb. most of these ht genes  are dominant or partially dominant, including ht <dig>  ht <dig>  ht <dig>  ht <dig>  htn <dig>  htm <dig>  <cit>  and the more recently identified htp, as well as rt  <cit> . most of the genes were not cloned but mapped on chromosomes: ht <dig> and htp were mapped on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>   <cit> , ht <dig> and htn <dig> were mapped on the bins  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit>  and rt was mapped on chromosome 3l   <cit> . we compared the physical locations of the predicted genes in the present study with the mapped ht genes, and we found that htp was closely linked with grmzm2g <dig> and rt was closely linked with grmzm2g <dig>  more studies were required to understand the associations between the identified candidates and underlying genes. no doubt, present data provides good information for final cloning and validating these genes. recently, two major qtls, one on chromosome  <dig>   <cit>  and the other on chromosome  <dig> , which is closely linked and functionally related to ht <dig>  <cit> , have been fine-mapped and their locations narrowed to  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively. however, we did not identify predicted genes within these regions in our population. since high heritability of resistance to nclb was observed in the association panel comprising of large number of lines, the major reason may be the number of markers in the population was limited. it was estimated that several million markers are required for a whole genome wide association study in maize  <cit> , which makes us have no enough power to detect all the underlying loci affecting target traits.

compared with single-marker association, haplotype-based association is expected to improve the power of detection when the marker density is limited. in the present study, the efficiency of ld mapping was improved by using a haplotype-based analysis, which was constructed from multiple snp markers within the same gene. as a result, we identified a total of ten loci at a genome-wide level for the three disease parameters. haplotypes may have the potential to be in higher ld with the causative variants than individual snps, especially when using medium-density snp panels. indeed, compared with the high heritabilities of the three traits, it was unlikely that resistance to nclb was determined by only a small number of genes. it is more likely that resistance to nclb is a complex trait involving a large number of loci, of which the candidates identified in this study may have the largest effects. given the expected > <dig>  maize genes and the 5– <dig> feasible snps per gene for a given haplotype, more markers are needed for precise ld mapping to accelerate the discovery of nclb resistance genes in maize.

as we mentioned earlier, association mapping is a powerful tool to detect loci involved in the inheritance of traits, but identifying loci responsible for more complex traits is difficult. population structure can result in spurious associations that result from unlinked markers being associated with causative loci  <cit> . such associations can occur when the disease frequency varies across subpopulations, thus increasing the probability that affected individuals will be sampled. any marker alleles that are present at a high frequency in the overrepresented subpopulation will be associated with the phenotype  <cit> . recently, the a-d test was applied as a useful complement to gwas of complex quantitative traits  <cit> . in present study, large number of markers was identified as having strong associations with the phenotype in the largest subgroup , whereas the other two subgroups with less lines revealed few or small number of significant snps. predicted genes containing the significant snps were identified, and  <dig> genes, including  <dig> genes that related to plant defenses, were found to be associated with two or three of the disease parameters. the a-d test balances false positives and statistical power, and it can be used to analyze complex traits such as resistance to nclb in maize.

CONCLUSIONS
an association panel including  <dig> diverse lines was evaluated for resistance to nclb in multiple environments, and a large number of resistant lines were identified and can be used as reliable resistance resource in maize breeding program. gwas reveals that nclb resistance is a complex trait under the control of many minor genes with relatively small effects. identical genes for resistance to nclb were detected using single-marker and haplotype-based associations, as well as a-d test. pyramiding these genes in the same background may result in stable resistance to nclb.
