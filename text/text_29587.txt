BACKGROUND
candida albicans causes systemic infections, typically in immunocompromised patients, as well as mucosal infections such as oropharyngeal candidiasis  in hiv-infected patients and chronic vaginal infections  <cit> . azole antifungal drugs are the mainstay of management of such infections. however, with increased use of these agents, particularly fluconazole, treatment failures associated with the emergence of azole-resistant strains of c. albicans have occurred  <cit>  this has been most evident in hiv/aids patients receiving long-term therapy for opc  <cit> 

the azoles bind to and inhibit the activity of lanosterol 14α-demethylase , a key enzyme in the fungal ergosterol biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . several mechanisms of resistance to azoles have been described in c. albicans. these include increased expression of the drug efflux pump genes such as mdr <dig>  cdr <dig> and cdr <dig>  <cit> , amino acid substitutions in the target enzyme erg11p due to missense mutations in the erg <dig> gene  <cit>  and possibly, overexpression of erg <dig>  <cit>  importantly in any one isolate, resistance may be due to a combination of mechanisms  <cit> .

to date, more than  <dig> amino acid substitutions have been described in erg11p with at least  <dig> of these identified in azole-resistant isolates  <cit>  the impact of individual substitutions, however, varies, and may differ between azoles. for example, substitutions such as y132h, g450e, g464s, r467k and s405f appear to primarily impact on fluconazole and voriconazole, but not posaconazole, susceptibility  <cit>  the effect of substitutions can also be additive – strains with g129a and g464s substitutions display higher mics azoles compared with those with the g129a substitution alone  <cit> . the contributions of yet other erg <dig> mutations to resistance are uncertain  <cit> . as most strains of c. albicans are diploid, nucleotide mutations may occur as homozygous  or as heterozygous  substitutions; the association of either type of mutation with the resistant  phenotype is not well defined  <cit> .

nonetheless, since even single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the erg <dig> gene can have an impact on susceptibility and contribute to resistance  <cit> , the documentation of these changes is important. to date, the frequency and clinical relevance of specific mutations in unselected azole-resistant isolates is poorly-defined  <cit>  although in one survey, erg <dig> mutations contributed to resistance in 65% of fluconazole-resistant c. albicans from hiv patients with opc  <cit> . in clinical practice, detection of erg <dig> mutations as potential markers or co-markers of resistance would assist both the identification and tracking of azole-resistant strains. traditionally, dna sequence analysis has been the standard for identifying erg <dig> nucleotide changes  <cit>  however, circularisable or padlock probes have recently been shown to reliably detect snps with high specificity, offering a rapid simple alternative to sequencing  <cit> . padlock probes comprise three distinct regions: a central linker is flanked by sequences complementary to the 5' and 3' termini of the target sequence. upon hybridisation to the target, the probe ends are brought together and are joined by dna ligase to form a closed circular molecule in a highly target-dependent manner . the intensity of the probe signal is then increased exponentially by rolling circle amplification  generating up to a 109-fold signal amplification within  <dig> min  <cit>  rca-based assays have been successfully used to identify fungal pathogens  <cit>  but have not yet been applied to the detection of gene mutations associated with antifungal drug resistance.

the present report describes the development and validation of a sensitive rca-based snp detection assay using real time pcr to detect point mutations in the c. albicans erg <dig> gene in eight azole-resistant "reference" isolates with known mutations  <cit> ; erg <dig> was chosen as the target gene to detect snps associated with azole resistance in a proof of principle study. in the study, rca and dna sequencing were applied to estimate the frequency of a series of erg <dig> mutations and their nature in  <dig> unselected australian c. albicans clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. the results were compared with those obtained for  <dig> fluconazole-susceptible strains.

RESULTS
c. albicans isolates and azole susceptibilities
thirty-three isolates had reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. twenty-eight were recovered from the oropharynx, two from the vagina and one each from bile, sputum and blood . the erg <dig> gene from eight of these isolates, referred to as "reference" isolates, was previously sequenced   <cit> ; the remaining  <dig> clinical isolates were interrogated for erg <dig> mutations . an additional  <dig> fluconazole-susceptible isolates  cultured from a range of body sites  were studied. thus  <dig> "test" isolates were analysed by rca and dna sequencing.

one of the eight "reference" isolates was susceptible-dose dependent  to fluconazole and seven were fluconazole-resistant ; five of these seven were also resistant to voriconazole   <cit> . six of the  <dig> australian isolates  had fluconazole mics in the s-dd range and were susceptible to voriconazole; the remaining  <dig> were resistant to fluconazole and seven  of these were cross-resistant to voriconazole . all  <dig> fluconazole-susceptible isolates were also susceptible to voriconazole .

detection of erg <dig> mutations by rca: sensitivity and specificity
point mutation-specific rca probes were designed based on the target polymorphism site of interest in the erg <dig> gene . to assess the sensitivity of the rca-based assay, rca was initially performed on 10-fold serial dilutions of the target template  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> copies of template. for all isolates studied, a clear rca fluorescence signal was observed with a sensitivity of detection of  <dig> copies; below this copy number, the signal was not easily distinguishable from the background signal  . only signals that were clearly measurable above background were considered to be indicative of the presence of the mutation.

the capability of the rca assay to detect heterozygous, as well as homozygous erg <dig> nucleotide changes was assessed indirectly by testing its ability to detect a specific mutation in the presence of wild-type template  using the eight "reference" isolates. for each of the known erg <dig> mutations , target template  containing the mutation at 100%, 50%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2% and 0% concentration in a backdrop of wild-type template were prepared by mixing both templates at the above-mentioned ratios. in all cases, a clear rca signal above background was observed down to a dilution containing 5% target template ; results were reproducible with minimal or no variation in repeat  experiments. the results demonstrate that the rca assay was able to detect erg <dig> mutations with high sensitivity in the presence of mixtures of dna and that the sensitivity was well above that required to detect heterozygous nucleotide changes  to template without mutation of 1:1)).

the rca assay was also highly specific. amplification of probe signals was seen only with matched template-probe mixtures. no signal was seen when template from isolates that did not contain the erg <dig> polymorphism targeted by a specific padlock probe were used. figure  <dig> illustrates a typical padlock probe-rca reaction using a probe to detect the erg11p y132h mutation. for isolates c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> , exponential increases in fluorescence signals were readily interpretable, indicating the presence of the y132h mutation. other "reference" isolates produced a signal at "background" level, indicative of absence of the mutation. all  <dig> known erg <dig> mutations in the "reference" isolates were correctly identified. the duration of the rca procedure was  <dig> h; however, a readily discernible signal was usually evident  <dig> min after commencement of the rca reaction.

investigation of erg <dig> mutations in test isolates by rca and erg <dig> sequencing
the erg <dig> gene for each of the  <dig> test isolates  was amplified by pcr and a  <dig> bp fragment  was probed using rca or subject to dna sequencing .

isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility
by sequencing, all but one isolate  contained at least one missense mutation when compared with the c. albicans atcc  <dig> sequence  . results obtained by the rca assay were concordant with dna sequencing for all isolates. however, dna sequencing identified four additional amino acid substitutions  in six separate isolates  – these substitutions were not detected by rca as the corresponding padlock probes targeting these mutation sites were not used in the study. thus erg <dig> point mutations resulting in  <dig> different amino acid substitutions were detected among the  <dig> test isolates by rca  whereas  <dig> substitutions were identified by dna sequencing. sequencing identified that all amino acid substitutions were due to homozygous nucleotide polymorphisms.

a the "a" and "b" notation of patient numbers refers to isolates which were cultured sequentially from the same patient at different times.

the substitution g464s was present in four isolates, g448e and g307s were present in three isolates each and the substitutions y132h, s405f and r467k  were rare . of note, five of the  <dig> erg <dig> mutations  present in "reference" isolates from the united states  were not detected in australian isolates. overall, the most frequently-identified substitutions were e266d  followed by v488i , d116e  and k128t . nineteen of the  <dig> mutations  were clustered in three regions of erg11p: positions 105– <dig>  266– <dig> and 405– <dig> .

sequential isolates were available from five patients . isolates from patients  <dig> and  <dig> had similar erg <dig> mutation and mic profiles; however, isolates from patient  <dig> demonstrated a step-wise increase in voriconazole mics in parallel with additional amino acid substitutions; the isolate with the highest mic contained five substitutions while the isolate with the lowest mic contained three . conversely, for patient  <dig>  one additional mutation was present from the analysis of the second isolate  but the fluconazole and voriconazole mics of this isolate were lower than that for isolate 12a. both isolates from patient  <dig> had similar azole mics but had one different erg <dig> mutation .

fluconazole-susceptible isolates
no erg <dig> mutations were detected by either rca or erg <dig> sequencing in five of the  <dig>  fluconazole-susceptible isolates. in the other  <dig>  five amino acid substitutions namely e266d , d116e , v488i , k128t  and v437i  were identified . by sequencing, homozygous nucleotide changes that led to the e <dig> substitution were present in all isolates; for the remaining amino acid substitutions, nucleotide mutations were heterozygous. in all cases, rca results were concordant with those obtained by dna sequencing confirming that the rca-based assay is capable of detecting both homozygous and heterozygous snp substitutions in erg <dig> 

mutations unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility
fifteen of the  <dig> erg11p amino acid substitutions present in c. albicans isolates displaying s-dd susceptibility or resistance to fluconazole were not identified in fluconazole-susceptible strains . these included the substitutions g307s, g464s, g448e r467k, s405f and y132h which have been reported to result in reduced susceptibility to azoles  <cit> 

discussion
azole antifungals are widely used for therapy and prophylaxis of candida infections. a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to these agents as well as early detection of resistance are essential for patient management. azole resistance is often due to a combination of factors including increased expression of efflux pumps and missense mutations in erg <dig>  <cit> . the latter have been linked to clinically-relevant increases in the mics, not only to fluconazole, but also to the newer azoles voriconazole and posaconazole  <cit>  this proof of principle study highlights the great potential of a simple rapid  and highly-specific rca-based snp detection assay that can be readily be performed in the clinical laboratory for the detection and/or surveillance for erg <dig> mutations. using this method, we identified erg11p amino acid substitutions in  <dig> of  <dig> previously-uncharacterised australian isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole.

the sensitivity and reproducibility of the rca assay was established by determining its ability to detect known erg <dig> mutations in "reference" isolates  in comparison with dna sequencing. the padlock probes designed for this study also accurately identified and distinguished between snps within the erg <dig> genes in the test isolates. these included snps that were located close together such as those at nucleotides  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> corresponding to the amino acid substitutions g448e, f449s and g450e, respectively . importantly, identification of erg <dig> mutations by the rca assay was concordant with sequencing in all cases where an erg <dig> mutation-specific probe was used. an additional finding was that even though probes  were not designed to detect heterozygous nucleotide substitutions per se, the rca assay detected such changes in isolates containing an erg <dig> mutation in only one allele, as demonstrated by their identification in fluconazole-susceptible isolates.

a large number  of amino acid substitutions were identified in test isolates with reduced susceptibility/resistance to fluconazole. in agreement with a prior report, all but one isolate had at least one, and often multiple missense mutations in erg <dig>  <cit> . substitutions also varied widely between individual isolates. similar results have been reported by perea et al. who detected  <dig> erg <dig> mutations in  <dig> c. albicans isolates with high level fluconazole resistance of which  <dig> were linked to resistance  <cit> . in contrast, just a single erg <dig> mutation profile  was found in  <dig> of  <dig> fluconazole-resistant isolates in another study  <cit> .

to our knowledge the g450v amino acid substitution has not been previously identified among isolates with reduced susceptibility to azoles. most of the other substitutions described here have previously been seen in azole-resistant isolates  <cit>  in particular, the substitutions g464s, g307s and g448e, known to confer azole resistance  <cit> , were identified in three or more isolates. however, it is notable that the substitutions y132h, s405f and r467k which appear to be prevalent in the united states and europe were rare in australian isolates  <cit> . nineteen of the  <dig> amino acid substitutions, including g450v, present in the test isolates were clustered into the three "hot-spot" regions as described previously  <cit> . these hot spots include the residues 105– <dig> near the n-terminus of the protein, region 266– <dig> and region 405– <dig> located towards the c terminus of the protein. the exception was the g307s substitution . however, in a computer-generated model of erg11p, g307s is located close to the heme cofactor binding site. as such, substitutions at this residue might be expected to impact negatively on the binding of the azole  <cit> .

in contrast to the fluconazole-resistant strains described above, 22% of fluconazole-susceptible isolates contained no erg <dig> mutations and of those that did, substantially fewer  amino acid substitutions were detected. also of interest, all erg11p amino acid substitutions from isolates with reduced azole susceptibility phenotypes were homozygous whereas with one exception , those in fluconazole-susceptible isolates were present as heterozygous substitutions. while these two observations support the general notion that erg <dig> mutations are linked to azole resistance, the presence of erg <dig> mutations in susceptible isolates is not readily explained. development of "resistance" requires prolonged exposure to an azole  <cit> ; however previous studies have not attempted to relate mutations in susceptible isolates to fluconazole exposure. due to the retrospective nature of the present study we were unable to test this association.

the limitations of this study are recognised. given the small numbers of isolates in our collection and that the presence of erg <dig> mutations are not necessarily functionally related to resistance, we were unable to determine the clinical relevance of the erg <dig> mutations identified. since the substitutions e266d, d116e and v347i were present in both fluconazole-susceptible and, resistant isolates, it could be argued that they are unlikely to have contributed to reduced azole susceptibility  <cit> . on the other hand, with one exception, all identified mutations were heterozygous in fluconazole-susceptible isolates; the finding supports the contention that loss of heterozygosity in a diploid species such as c. albicans is a step in the development of the azole-resistant phenotype  <cit> . it is also possible that many erg <dig> polymorphisms whilst not conferring resistance per se, may play a role in increasing the level of resistance  <cit> .

conversely, the absence of substitutions g307s, g448e, g464s, y132h, s405f and r467k, in susceptible isolates strongly suggests they have contributed to the resistant phenotype. this hypothesis can be tested by site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies of specific erg <dig> alleles in saccharomyces cerevisiae. using this approach, sanglard and co-workers demonstrated that the substitutions g464s, y132h, s405f and r467k were linked to azole resistance among their collection of isolates  <cit> ; similar studies are warranted to determine if the new substitution g450v is associated with resistance. testing matched, susceptible and resistant, isolates from the same patient for erg <dig> mutations may also assist in determining if particular mutations impact on azole resistance; unfortunately, matched isolates were not available in the present study. in general, neither the type or number of mutations in isolates sequentially obtained from the same patient correlated with azole mics , emphasising the need to assess additional genes to understand the contribution of each to the resistance phenotype. as such, methods that detect polymorphisms are well-placed to screen large numbers of isolates from different sources for mutations and to guide functional testing of these isolates for resistance.

this study demonstrates a new application of a simple rca-based technique for the rapid and accurate detection of snps in the erg <dig> gene as potential markers of resistance and for the tracking of resistant strains. other sequencing-independent methods include conventional real time pcr and/or other probe-based technologies eg. molecular beacons or taqman probes  <cit> . results using conventional real time pcr are well-known to be highly-dependent on the physical characteristics of the platform. molecular beacons and taqman probe methods are conveniently available in the form of commercial kits. although able to detect snps with good sensitivity  <cit> , strict attention to the tm of the probes is required to ensure adequate specificity. the rca-based method described here offers several advantages over other amplification techniques in that ligation of the probe ends by dna ligase requires perfectly-matched target-probe complexes preventing nonspecific amplification generated by conventional pcr and resulting in very high specificity. it is also rapid . whilst the set-up costs of the assay are relatively high, , a typical commercial batch of each probe provides sufficient material for up to  <dig> assays. running costs are estimated at no more than aud  <dig> per assay compared to aud  <dig> for dna sequencing. the limitations of rca in the primary identification of resistance are acknowledged . however, the technique is well-suited as an epidemiological tool for high throughput screening for commonly-encountered erg <dig> snps to assist in the detection of potentially-resistant strains and to track the movement of such strains. further, its utility in detecting snps in other genes that have been linked to azole resistance in c. albcians such as those encoding for the transcriptional activator of cdr <dig>  and the transcriptional activator upc <dig>   <cit>  warrant consideration.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the sensitive and specific rca-based assay proved to be a simple robust method for the rapid detection of erg <dig> mutations and showed excellent concordance with dna sequencing. it has good potential as a tool for tracking specific strains and identifying markers/co-markers of azole resistance. broader implications include application of the method in the study of oher gene mutations linked to azole resistance in c. albicans and of azole resistance in other fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus in which erg <dig> mutations are a major mechanism of resistance  <cit> .
