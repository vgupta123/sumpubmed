BACKGROUND
for more than a decade, whole-genome sequencing strategies have typically employed one of two strategies: the bac-by-bac approach in which bac clones that represent a minimum tiling path  are sequenced sanger-style, as was taken for the rice and maize projects  <cit> , or whole-genome shotgun  sequencing using random sanger-style sequencing of entire genomic libraries of clones with varying insert size, such as was used to sequence the genomes of black cottonwood, grapevine, and sorghum  <cit> . traditional de novo sequencing of large, complex eukaryotic genomes is plagued with assembly challenges caused by repetitive dna and segmental duplications. misassembly of distal genomic regions is always a potential pitfall, but this can be localized and minimized using a targeted sequencing approach including bac-by-bac sequencing.

given the cost of a sanger-sequence-based bac-by-bac approach, alternative techniques for targeting sub-genomic regions for sequencing are being explored that utilize the high sequencing depth achievable using next-generation sequencing technologies. for example, to determine if deep roche/ <dig> sequencing of pooled bac clones effectively generated an accurate sub-genomic assembly, rounsley et al. sequenced and assembled a  <dig> mbp region of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> in rice; they concluded that assembly of six bac pools, with an mtp derived from a physical map of approximately  <dig> mbp, was accurate  <cit> . using the  <dig> next-generation sequence reads, rounsley et al. were able to assemble the  <dig> mbp rice fragments with an n <dig> contig size ranging from  <dig>  kbp to  <dig>  kbp and an n <dig> scaffold size ranging from  <dig> kbp to  <dig> kbp. other studies in barley  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , and melon  <cit>  have been carried out using a similar bac pooling and  <dig> sequencing strategy that allows for high quality sequencing of sub-genomic regions of high priority  at a cost far less than that of whole-genome sequencing.

theobroma cacao, with its relatively small genome size  and high information content fingerprinting -based  <cit>  physical map  that includes bac-end sequences , serves as an ideal test case for pooled-bac sequencing. reference sequences exist as the genomes of t. cacao cv. criollo  <cit>  and cv. matina 1- <dig> http://www.cacaogenomedb.org have been sequenced. multiple qtls underlying traits such as fungal disease resistance have been identified and serve as important sequencing targets  <cit> . of particular interest are regions that provide resistance to black pod, a disease caused by a fungal pathogen of mixed phytophthora species  <cit> . black pod decreases cacao yields by an estimated 20-30% annually  <cit> . isolating genes responsible for resistance to black pod is of high importance to cacao breeding programs  <cit> .

t. cacao hicf physical map contig  <dig>  the subject of our study, is located on t. cacao linkage group  <dig>  and contains  <dig> microsatellite markers spanning  <dig> cm . three qtls have been mapped to this region including a consensus qtl for black pod resistance  and qtls for two horticultural traits: bean shape index  and pod weight  . the bp qtls were first identified by risterucci et al. working with a population developed in côte d'ivoire  <cit> . progeny were derived from a cross of a seedling of 'sca6' crossed with an upper amazon forastero clone known to contain resistance to bp, high productivity , and a trinitario variety. the male parent, 'ifc <dig> ' is a highly homozygous lower amazon forastero  susceptible to bp. progeny of this cross were evaluated using leaf-disc inoculation with three phytophthora species, p. megakarya, p. palmivora and p. capsici, using two strains of each species. the original genetic map was made using aflp markers and a map with  <dig> markers was produced; thirteen qtls for bp resistance were reported all of which conveyed resistance to all three species  <cit> . this aflp map was later augmented with microsatellite markers  <cit> . using the microsatellite markers in the original progeny, common markers were then used to align the aflp map with the consensus map . thirteen consensus bp qtl were identified using a meta-analysis approach  <cit> , two of which are on lg <dig> and one, cbp- <dig> qtl, is located on hicf contig  <dig>  <cit> . the cbp- <dig> qtl is located between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm with the most significant peak at  <dig>  cm and it explains  <dig> % of the variation for this trait using a detached pod test  <cit> . qtls for pw and bsi have also been located on the distal end of lg <dig>  <cit> . both qtl co-locate with the cbp- <dig> qtl.

here, we describe and evaluate the reconstruction of this small qtl-rich, sub-genomic region  of t. cacao using a pooled bac shotgun sequencing and assembly approach. this segment spans approximately  <dig> mbp as estimated by the hicf physical map . we sequenced the  <dig> bacs comprising the mtp as individual linear or pooled paired-end libraries using the  <dig> titanium platform. the scaffolds obtained from a de novo assembly were ordered and oriented solely by mapping bes based on the known physical map mtp order. to assess the  <dig> assembly quality, we also sequenced  <dig> contiguous bacs from the mtp using sanger sequencing. once a quality assembly was constructed, candidate genes were mapped and putative genes conferring black pod resistance, bean shape index, and pod weight were identified as a first step in further evaluation. we also empirically estimated the minimum paired/linear  <dig> read coverage necessary to assemble high quality sub-genomic  <dig> mbp regions. we discuss other practical details helpful for successfully sequencing high-priority genomic regions of similar size from any organism for which a physical map has been constructed.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and preprocessing
pooled reads from twenty-seven t. cacao cv. matina 1- <dig> bacs comprising the bp, bsi, and pw qtls  and hicf contig  <dig> mtp  were obtained from a paired-end library preparation sequenced on one region of a 2-region  <dig> gs flx titanium picotiterplate . sequencing of a paired-end library using current technology yields both reads mated over the specified genomic jump distance, here called paired reads, and reads of unpaired genomic fragments, here called linear reads. separate datasets from the sequencing of  <dig> individual shotgun-indexed -encoded, roche/ <dig> sequencing) libraries were pooled and sequenced on a parallel region of the 2-region ptp. raw paired and linear runs yielded  <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp of sequence data, respectively .

raw reads from all sequencing reactions were extensively processed prior to assembly. after mate pair splitting, linker, bar-code, vector and e. coli contamination removal, coverages of the paired and pooled linear libraries were  <dig> × and  <dig> ×, respectively . processed reads were then separated into pools containing linear , mate paired , and no-mate pair singletons , each pool comprising 5× coverage. the nm sequence set contains unpaired reads from the paired read library and was generated to determine if unmated reads can substitute for linear reads, which would reduce the need for the preparation of a costly second library.

assembly and pseudomolecule construction
a total of twenty-nine  <dig> assemblies representing hicf physical map contig  <dig> were obtained using the celera wgs-assembler . these assemblies were prepared using various combinations of 5×-increment read coverages of the l, pp, and nm pools of reads . in parallel, ten mtp bacs  were individually sequenced using sanger sequencing, individually assembled using phrap  <cit> , combined into a pseudomolecule, and used as a gold-standard reference sequence against which to assess the quality of the  <dig> assemblies.

upon close inspection, it was noted that two 35l-20pp scaffolds each consisted of a single bac, and that one bac was missing from the assembly in that its bes did not align to any scaffold. two of these bacs  were presumably mislabeled or the result of contamination from a neighboring well that occurred during or after construction of the physical map and we therefore pooled the wrong bac for sequencing. another mtp bac may have resulted from an fpc assembly error , but its etiology is unclear. three replacement mtp bacs  were therefore selected by searching flanking contig end sequence with hicf physical map contig  <dig> bac-end sequences and selecting a bac with paired-end sequences anchored to both contig ends. these alternate mtp bacs were individually sanger-sequenced and substituted for the correct genomic sequence .

the corrected 35l-20pp assembly was then validated by aligning it with genetic markers from the composite linkage map  <cit>  localized to this region of the t. cacao genome . all markers were ordered correctly with the exception of one small inversion . upon examination of high quality mate pairs and linear reads, read depth spikes of coverage where bacs overlap were apparent . interestingly, although variation in stoichiometry as assumed by read coverage varied up to four-fold, these variations in coverage intensity appeared to have minimal effect on the overall assembly. comparison of the  <dig> pseudomolecule to the sanger reference using lagan  <cit>  or mummer  <cit>  indicated that a majority of the assembly in this region was consistent in that only six gaps between the two sequences were apparent . close inspection of these regions revealed that a gap in the  <dig> pseudomolecule was primarily due to regions of simple sequence repeats present in the sanger-based assembly. finally, we were able to localize the  <dig> pseudomolecule to the 'tc05' contig from the recent release of the t. cacao cv. criollo assembly  <cit> . a small inversion  and a large insertion  relative to the criollo genome were observed . it is unclear if these differences are due to polymorphism and/or misassembly. it should be noted that these comparisons were performed on the corrected pseudomolecule with the three sanger bac assemblies inserted into the pooled bac  <dig> assembly. therefore, while these comparisons validate the quality of the pseudomolecule assembly, they do not provide a pure comparison of  <dig> vs. sanger-based assemblies.

annotating the assembly
we used publicly available t. cacao est assemblies  to annotate genes in the 35l-20pp pseudomolecule. from the set of  <dig>  ests, we mapped  <dig> putative unigene clusters using moderate blastn  <cit>  stringencies . these unigenes were annotated for gene ontology  <cit> , kegg biochemical pathway  <cit> , and conserved interproscan protein domain  <cit>  functional signatures. annotations were compiled in a single row per unigene format  or in a database-friendly format . unigene sequences are provided .

descriptions of homologous genes and all individual annotations were manually inspected for relevance to the bp resistance, pw, and bsi traits. in the case of bp resistance, candidate resistance genes were selected by searching for unigenes associated with "stress," which narrowed the candidate black pod resistance genes from all  <dig> to  <dig> . the specific terms used for selection were: "stress response to abiotic stimulus ;" "response to biotic stimulus ;" "response to endogenous stimulus ;" "response to extracellular stimulus ;" and "response to stress ." in addition, gene annotations were inspected for relevance to the bsi and pw traits without strict criteria.

the following bold terms were used for candidate gene selection: response to abiotic stimulus; response to biotic stimulus; response to endogenous stimulus; response to extracellular stimulus; response to stress.

the following terms were omitted due to low information content: biological_process; biosynthetic process; binding; catalytic activity;cellular process; dna metabolic process; metabolic process. protein binding.

discussion
we have used next-generation sequencing and a pooled mtp bac approach to re-construct a high-quality  <dig> mbp region of the t. cacao genome that contains genes putatively responsible for heritable resistance to the black pod fungal pathogen as well as genes associated with two horticultural traits: bean shape index and pod weight. targeted sub-genome sequencing using a pooled bac approach as described in this and other studies  <cit>  is an alternative to whole-genome shotgun  sequencing that offers key relative advantages including fast sample to pseudomolecule processing time, reduced cost, and fewer misassemblies of distal chromosomal segments. this technique is especially useful when quality sequence from a specific genomic region of high importance, e.g. a qtl associated with a large phenotypic effect, is needed as a reference for localized functional genomics studies . while many diploid genomes are rapidly becoming available using wgs techniques, especially large, complex, or polyploid genomes still pose challenges for accurate and cost-effective wgs. the investment in a complete physical map for the purpose of mtp discovery can accelerate assembly and improve accuracy in the de novo construction of high priority genome segments.

during this study, we encountered several issues of practical concern for researchers carrying out similar projects. first, the selection of an accurate mtp is paramount. as with many high-throughput genomics studies, the large number of 384-well plates needed for a 10×+ coverage bac library increases the risk of mislabeling or inverting labels. in addition to human error, the limitations of fingerprinting algorithms to correctly assemble clones with extremely dense banding patterns due to over-representation of the restriction sites or clones that contain highly repetitive sequences can lead to statistical errors in selections of an mtp. in this study, we individually re-sequenced the misplaced bacs that we discovered, after assembly, had been incorrectly selected as part of the mtp. a re-fingerprinting of the mtp prior to library construction would ensure its accuracy prior to pooling. second, creating a sanger reference sequence from a subset of the mtp targeted for pooling enables testing for accuracy of assemblies comprised of various read mixtures . while the optimal assembly with the 35l-20pp mixture was derived from all pre-processed reads, our data suggest that sequencing the pool at a lower coverage would result in only a minor sacrifice in assembly quality . for example, it appears that unmated reads obtained from a paired-end library  could substitute for a second linear library, at least with the titanium platform . circumventing the construction and sequencing of a second linear library would be a significant cost advantage. our study could be used as a baseline for determining sequencing depth in future pooled bac de novo assembly experiments. however, as sequencing technologies improve critical factors such as read length, it would be prudent to reassess minimal coverage required for accurate assembly.

we used a t. cacao unigene set to identify potential genes in our de novo-assembled genome fragment containing the black pod resistance qtl. future studies utilizing the t. cacao genome sequence  should provide gene sets of higher quality. of the  <dig>  unique unigene clusters we utilized,  <dig> mapped to within the  <dig> mbp pseudomolecule. after functional profiling was performed and annotations examined for the candidate unigenes,  <dig> unigenes were selected based on having annotations associated with biotic/abiotic stress responses . the complete, fully annotated gene list can be found in additional file 7: table s <dig>  eight of the  <dig> unigenes were annotated for "response to biotic stimulus " and one of these eight, gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig>  is especially intriguing. this unigene maps to the pseudomolecule as a single high-scoring segment pair  from position  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  and codes for a thaumatin-like protein which is part of the pathogenesis-related  family of proteins implicated in systemic acquired and induced resistance mechanisms  <cit> . members of this family have been shown to have antifungal activity specifically against phytophthora spp.  <cit> , the causal pathogens in black pod disease  <cit> . another interesting gene, gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig>  mapped to the pseudomolecule as a single hsp from position  <dig>  to  <dig>  . this unigene has homology to six arabidopsis genes encoding "barley mildew resistance locus o " proteins; members of this protein family, at3g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at1g <dig>  and at2g <dig> , contain seven transmembrane domains. mlo proteins have been shown to have antifungal properties and require a syntaxin, a glycosyl hydrolase and an abc transporter to confer resistance through inhibition of cell entry  <cit> . while no gene associated with syntaxin function was identified in the black pod resistance region, two genes encoding abc transporter activity were identified, gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig>  gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig>  and another gene in the region putatively encodes alpha  <dig> -glycosyltransferase . these data do not prove a causal relationship between these putative genes and the black pod resistance trait; these genes are, however, logical candidates for genetic validation experiments.

we also searched for candidate genes underlying the bean shape index and pod weight qtls also localized to this sub-genomic region. a single unigene with homology to alpha-expansin, gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig>  mapped to the pseudomolecule as  <dig> hsps . alpha-expansins are involved in cell extension  <cit>  and this gene could be involved in the bsi and/or pw phenotypes via pod/bean development processes. another interesting unigene identified in the region encodes a pox-domain  and was detected as a single hsp  with homology to at5g <dig>  , a member of the "three amino acid loop extension"  homeodomain superfamily; this superfamily has been associated with multiple phenotypes including silique development  <cit> . finally, a single unigene, gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig> , encoding a myb-domain  and a second unigene, gnl_ug_tcc_s <dig> , share homology with a transcription factor, gt-3a, containing a myb-like  dna-binding domain. as with the gene candidates for black pod resistance, speculation that functions of these genes underlie variations in bean shape and pod weight present them as logical targets for genetic validation studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we efficiently and successfully sequenced a region of the t. cacao genome containing important qtls for resistance to black pod and development of cacao fruit. we also identified candidate genes that may influence these traits. our results suggest that pooling portions of a minimum tiling path derived from a bac-based physical map is an effective method for identifying candidate genes contained within qtl intervals. in addition, our assembly is a high-quality reference sequence for mapping other reads resulting from next-generation sequencing applications to detect both dna polymorphisms and differential gene expression patterns associated with the qtl region.

while we focused on a single qtl region, any qtl regions of special interest from any genome can be similarly sequenced thus allowing for timely discoveries of biological importance while a complete genome assembly of high quality is being constructed over a longer time frame. our study suggests improvements that can be made in the practical aspects associated with pooled bac sequencing and partial assembly of a genome. these details are important in planning a cost-effective sequencing strategy. for example, our results suggest that a single paired-end  <dig> library sequenced on one-half of a titanium  <dig> plate may be sufficient to accurately assemble a  <dig> mbp pool. we also found that one or two bacs sequenced using sanger techniques serve as an excellent control when assessing assembly accuracy, information that will only become more critical as pool sizes increase.
